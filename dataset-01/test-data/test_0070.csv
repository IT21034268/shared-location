2,only 1 good song,"Only good song on this album is ""All of this"" because Robert Smith is one of the best.Suggestion: Buy Dude Ranch. it was blink's last good album"
5,MUST GET!!!,"This album is must get for anyone with any interest in blink 182. Liked any of their old albums? than you gotta get this album, even they say it's the best album yet, and it's true!!! The time and effort put into this album can clearly be heard when you listen to the album!!!! GET it!!!"
3,If you're a Blink fan Buy this Album,"The recent self titled album is strong musically. However, lyrically the album is tremendously weak. It appears that much of the lyrics are meaningless and do not correspond with the songs. As I listened to some earlier Blink music I realize this has not always been the case. Some of the past lyrics have been weak but at least they conveyed a message. I do not feel the lyrics of most of the songs convey anything.As for the music itself, it is the best of any Blink album. I would have rated this album higher if the lyrics were stronger. Track 12 with the guest singer from The Cure is my favorite song on the album followed by track 3. I think the members of the band not being unified and doing different projects has affected the lyrics and band's message. Nevertheless, if you are a blink fan, pick up the album."
2,This album SUX!!!,"It's obvious that Blink-182 has enough money now...from putting out a certain style of RADIO-FRIENDLY music to increase their fan base...that they can put out a cd like this and be ok with it. It's a slap in the face to everyone who became their fan based on a certain style of music. This new ""grown up"" album SUX worse than their old stuff, and everyone thinks it's great just because they have a name everyone recognizes.(?) SHEEP!!! Not only are the lyrics boring, but so is the music. It's not fun...it's not the Blink they sold to us to get on the charts... and I know they lost at LEAST one fan.I returned the cd and demanded my money back. I'm happy to catalog their good stuff and remember them when they were at their peak."
1,Mall Punk Veterans Get Old & Complain,"Why is it that when white suburban kids get a pop-band together, whether it's Mall Punk, Nu Metal, or Rap Rock, they inevitably make whining albums about how rough life is. Shut up and play, you little sissies. Blink 182 have seen their album sales decrease with every new album release, so they felt it was time to ""mature."" To Blink, maturity means whine and complain over now cliche ""Mall Punk"" guitars. I suppose if you are 14 years old and yer grounded for a week, this might be a decent enough, parent-friendly album. Wait, they have tattoos and lip piercings, so their music MUST be pretty tough, right? HA!The only reason that the world shouldnt burn every copy of this album in existence is that Robert Smith of the Cure is on it. Robert Smith is God! Go buy the Cure's Disintigration LP instead!!!!"
1,Nothing of art,"hey this cd sucks, they seems to not have enough time to create good songs ,because the cd has two songs, only to complete the numbers of songs that the company needs. It has Anthem part II (live in Chicago) and another one which is a kind of rap, without lyrics, and with a disgusting melody. I think they were under pressure to finish this record that's why the songs are not so elaborated and well composed.The last Cd, which the boys did without pressure was Enema Of the state, just listen and you will realized, enema was record without samplers and all that stupid stuff."
3,Warning Label For Reason!,"Yeah! I know, you probably think I'm a dork for saying this cd is bad for kids. But it's the truth. And parents should hear me out, to protect there kids from this cd.When my freind told me about these guys, i went and bought this album, edited. The first song ""Felling This"" is terrible! The first few phrases are talking about sex. He uses the F word. Terrible. The song isn't even that good. In ""Obvious"" he does the same thing with using the F word to represent sex. I know you F***** him again. Why must you put that in there, Blink 182! In Violence, he uses alchohol in there. The very first phrase! In Here's Your Letter, he uses the F word again! The other songs are okay, but, they're not that good. Stockholm Syndrome, Down, and I Miss You are my favorites. Parents, this cd has a warning label for a reason! Unless your kids have an Mp3 and can download other songs, don't let them buy this cd! Even if its edited!"
4,Impressive,"I am a HUGE blink fan as well, and i have to say that i like this cd. people who liked the other albums with the joke songs will probably be less appreciative of the artistic sophistication displayed on this album. although it is less ""punk"" it is definitely a CD worth buying"
2,I STILL THINK THIS CD SUCKS,I APOLOGIZE 4 MY LAST REVIEW I DIDN'T FULLY HEAR THE CD BUT I STILL THINK IT REALLY REALLY SUCKS THERE R A FEW SONGS THAT ARE OK BUT I STILL HATE IT AND HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEM. I DO WISH THAT I MISS YOU WASN'T A SINGLE BECAUSE I HEAR IT TOO MUCH. I ALSO WISH THEY'D CHANGE THEIR STYLE BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND THAT WANNABE PUNK ROCK S***.I HOPE THEY GO BACK TO THEIR OLD STUFF OR RETIRE BECAUS IT'S BECOMING AN ANNOYANCE SEEING PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE PUNK WHEN THEY ONLY LISTEN TO BLINK 182.FOR U LT SMASH I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING BACK TOWARDS MY LAST REVIEW YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A WHIMP AND YOU SHOULD'VE NEVER SAID THAT CRAP ABOUT MY FRIEND I ALSO SAW YOUR REVIEW AND NOTICED ONLY ONE PERSON FOUND IT HELPFUL AND IT WAS PROBABLY YOUheres some advice NEVER F*** WITH ME OR RUNNRWOOD AGAIN UNLESS YOU CAN FIGHT BACK YOU J***A**
1,THIS IS NOT PUNK ROCK!!!!!!!,"I hate blink 182 and other bands like them. They claim to be punk rock and the fact of the matter is that punk is dead and it is because of bands like this. Stop watching mtv and go to your local record store and pick up some old school punk, better yet if you like 182 then dont because i dont want any more posers out there making the scene even worse"
4,Good not Great.,"I'm glad to see that Blink 182 decided not sell their teenage partying image since it has been about 8 or 9 years since they were unable to ""score a 40"" at the local liquor store.A little darker and more serious album, singing more about relationships...and more more about relationships. Tom seems to get the call on alot more of their songs, which is a bad idea.I dont know if they had some mid-career crisis and wanted to change their image into some Misfit/Rancid band. I think they are just trying to discover themselves, I predict their next album will be real good.Good album, not great it's only Blink trying to crawl out of the pop punk stereotype they've gotten themselves into."
2,"no, not maturity please","im sorry guys, I am probably one of your biggest fans, and I like the courage in your experimentation, but (in opinion of course) i have to say that the new style is not cool. The songs dont contain a tenth of the hilarious, catchy, get-stuck-in-your-head lyrics that made your must-have albums ""Enema of the State"" and ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"". So, I can understand why you want to cover up these meaningless words with that blaring, droning sound that has appeared in this CD. ""Feeling this"" is like a sad tribute to those classic punk anthems that got me to what is now my senior year such as ""What's My Age Again,"" and ""Give Me One Good Reason."" I wish you guys would go back to what was gold and stop trying to be so grown up. Being a young punk is so much more fun."
5,a work of art,i was very pleased about this album the last album was a hard one to beat and i think this one has put a new look for blink across it has an earthy sound and great effects i found no disapointing features in the album and could not stop playing it its a fantastic album and worth every penny
5,BLINK 182 IS THE BEST,this album has to be one of the best albums they have released. Its different from what they usually play but it has GREAT and i mean great songs on it. I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! EVERYONE MUST GET IT!!! BLINK 182 KICKS @$$
4,Very Impressed,"I was a little anxious about this new record from one of my all time favs Blink 182. Being a fan of the older pre-Enema of the State Blink 182 I was tired of the overly poppy TRL friendly albums. But then I heard the self titled. This record is amazing. The songs are structured better and are less poppy then other albums. They arnt singing entirely different topics, i.e girls high school, stuff like what they've done in the past, but its more mature. You wont find any songs with lyrics like ""Whats My Age Again"" on this one. Favorites are ""Feeling This"", Im Lost Without You"", ""Always"" and ""All of This"" with the Cures Robert Smith. I definitly recommend this record to any Blink fan, old and new, and anyone else that would like to hear a little bit of everything."
2,farther from the blink,"I didn't really like this new stuff blink is trying out. The only thing good on this cd is ""All I Know"" with Robert Smith, with the possibility of there newest single ""I Miss You"". CD after CD it looks to be downhill for the blink."
2,Simple Music,"i bought this cd because i like blink and there sound, even if it is simple. I have played guitar for 6 years, and i know for a fact that i can play twice as good as Tom plays on this latest album, and porbably better. Wouldnt you think that in all that time to practice he wouldve gotten better? Or at least looked up the definition of the word 'solo'? The music is alright and the lyrics are good, but i just dont like how simple the music is. I have the same problem with Green Day and Nirvana, but i think those bands are more talented than Blink 182 is right now. i dont intensely dislike the cd, but its not constantly in my changer. My fav songs are Go, Easy Target, and All of This. I love The Cure, and i think that Robert Smith is great in the song, even though the lyrics dont match his style. its alright."
5,the best cd yet to come,"this new album of blink 182 is the best yet to come.i suggest you go out and buy the new self titled blink 182 cd. This new cd is a new type of blink music,they worked hard to make this cd and it tooked them a long time but it was worth the wait.i could listen to all there songs all day.so go buy it!!!!"
5,Blinking good stuff,"I've always had a soft spot for Blink 182.There upbeat party-punk rock sounded so good compared to most of those trendy but depressing nu-metal bands.When listening to this album for the first time I initially felt disappointed by their new musical direction,more downbeat,darker and less mum insults! However,this is a slowburner of an album but with patience you realise the songs are the strongest ever written by the band.The drumming by Travis is the best I,ve heard since Dave Grohl's QOTSA sessions with Tom and Mark vocal's crisper than ever.This is the first review I have ever written so this album must have had an impact on me."
3,"Well, it is really a three and a half.","I'm a Blink fan, not a huge one granted, but a fan none the less, so tghe reason I don't rate this higher is because I do not feel the band to particularly great in the first place. However, I've listened to em for a whiile, and they have definately mature in their sound for this cd. For those of you who have just heard ""Feelin This,"" disregard it, it is like a poppy little guilty pleasure, bubble gum before the main attraction. After the first track, the CD turns serious. They have geared the band a godd deal away from boob and dick jokes and much more towards serious music. I especially enjoyed track 4 and track 12 with Robert Smith of the Cure. So, no, it is not the best CD ever, but for a band I had totally lost faith in (ugh, Take Off Your Pant and Jacket) it was a pleasant surprise which I quite enjoyed."
3,"Good CD, but it's just not my blink","I'm not going to lie this is a great CD. But it's just not the blink I've grown up with. The first time I heard the CD a part of me died, that F$&*ing your mom part. This would be one of my favorite CDs of all time if it weren't from blink. Blink was my escape from the emotions in life. I guess I'll have to now listen to Dude Ranch and reminisce about the good old days when blink still told me not to care."
5,the new blink= the best blink,"WOW, i couldnt wait for this album to come out. Every song was amazing, each song had its own personality and its own sound. Unlike thier other albums, the songs are amazingly crafted and flat out awesome to listen to! The highlights of the album are: Violence, Obvious, All of This,& The Fallen Interlude. If you want to buy a cd... i suggest buying this one.... The best cd of the year."
5,Unique Blink,"This is my favorite blink album so far. Besides the fact that their style has evolved and grown into an even more unique style, the linear notes for the album are amazing. The night I bought it I went home and listened to it from beginning to end reading all lyrics and comments. Travis, Mark, and Tom write notes about almost every song, and if you read it from beginning to end it's almost as if you are reading a diary of their recording process. This album is about these three talented guys that have each grown as an individual as well as within the group."
4,Blink 182 has had some growing up,Blink 182 has matured and come people say they don't like this BUT i think its for the better. They still joke and they are their still hteir goofy selves thay just have better lyrical songs and the instrumental is amazing. It's not just groing up they have money. I think its their best album yet.I say everyone should go out there an buy it and support them instead of pirating so their cd will top this one!
1,WTF HappENED 2 ThE PuNK! !,ight all i have 2 say is where did the punk go....hey blink Got Punk? hell no.....(calm down) i luv blink but there new stuff Take Off You Pants and Jacket suked....new album good but poppy-u kno its not punk wen all the Prep girls in ur skewl like it.....Blink is still O.K. but close 2 bad but there new stuff is just....ewwwwif u like punk and old blink...dont buy this album i repeat dont buy this album!
1,Blink 182?? nope this isnt them,"this is Box Car Racer, they must have labeled the CD wrong, there is no ""Blink"" type song, the closest and best song on the CD is ""Feeling This"" the other sucks and lack structure or originalityBlink has gone from Pop-Punk, to Pop-Emo now"
1,They Did Horrorible,I agree with my friend Runnrwood that the new Blink stuff is 100% CRAP.i USED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT FOR THESE GUYS AND THEY GO OFF AND DO SOME TRUE CRAP.I BELIEVE THAT THIS CD SUCKS THESE GUYS NEED TO RETIRE.THE MAIN REASON THEY NEED TO RETIRE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE A WANNABE PUNK ROCK BAND THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS CD ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I HAVE TO IF YOU KNOW WHATS BEST YOU'LL NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS S***I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LT SMASH FROM PHILLY. YOU SAID SOME CRAP ABOUT MY FRIEND RUNNRWOOD BECAUSE HE HATES BLINK 182AND HE LIKES LINKIN PARK WELL YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO SAY THAT YOU IDIOT. IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU WANT TO WORSHIP THIS STUPID S***.YOU DISSED MY FRIEND FOR NO GOOD REASON TRY SAYING THAT TO ME.YOU ARE THE IDIOT NOT RUNNRWOOD.DONT BE UPSET BECAUSE LINKIN PARK DOES STUFF WORTH LISTENING TO.ALSO NEVER EVER SAY THAT LINKIN PARK IS MORE POP THAN BLINK WILL EVER BE BECAUSE THAT IS MIXED UP.ONE LAST THING JON KEESEE STILL THINKS YOU'RE A J***A**
4,this cd kicks ass,the cd is awesome. its definitly blink at their best. buy it now if u dont own it already ....if u do play it and blast it.
4,Best Blink CD,I think this is by far the best Blink 182 cd. it may sound a bit different but is is the best they have made and the Features are great.
5,Growing On Me,"Well this is not the Blink I expected..... it is completely different. I first saw the video three days prior to the offcial release of the album (Feeling This). As I listened to the CD for the first time I was truly disappointed, but as I continued to listen the music began to grow on me. A weel later I saw them perform in Boston at the Orpheum. The tracks sound even better live. I have fallen in love with this CD. Come to think of it, deja-vu...... I felt the same way about Take of your Pants and Jacket."
2,my opinions..,im sorry but this album is not blink 182 at all. dont get me wrong now it doesnt suck incredibly bad though...but it wasnt what i was looking for in blink 182. this album is way too slow and emo. its incredible if you listen to dude ranch or cheshire cat and then play this album its so different. i think this album is much reflected on box car racer. get one of their more previous albums :)
2,Not the real Blink,"Let me start off by saying that I have been a fan of these guys since the very beginning. I have everything from Flyswatter to this CD. I can honestly say anything before ""Enema"" was worth listening to. Once Travis joined the band (although he is one of the greates drummers of all time) they seem to have taken a turn for the worse, and this album proves it. There is really only one song I like and that is ""Go"". The rest of these are just terrible. Instead of expiermenting, they should have just gone back to their old more punk like style. Most of these songs are slow and sad. If you want something like that go listen to Alkaline Trio, whose songs about relationships and death are far better then anything off this CD. I give it two stars, cause I still like these guys, and maybe they realize the mistake they made."
3,"Not as good as previous albums, but OK","I'll admit that B182 is one of the only good punk bands out there, but this is a dive from their previous work in albums like Buddha, Cheshire Cat and Take off your Pants and Jacket. Some songs, however like ""Violence"" and ""Obvious"" are great with great riffs and drumming from one of the best drummers ever (Travis). But some songs like ""Fallen Interlude"" (what the f*** was that?) and ""I'm lost without you"" are very different and not punk at all, their not even rock. But, all in all Travis still manages to be one of the greatest drummers of all time and Tom comes up with some pretty good riffs, I don't think Mark's that great of a bass player though, he's okay but he's no Cliff Burton. If you like punk then buy this, if not than don't."
2,Blink,"i am really into punk music and i had never heard of Blink 182 but my friend said they were punk so I listened to the self titled cd. It's a good cd but it's pop punk. punk is a political movement not some love song which is what this cd is. Feeling This is about wanting his girlfriend Violence ""like violence you and me forever and after"" All of This is about wanting a girl Obvious is about a cheating girlfriend I Miss You is about missing his girlfriend. So if you are into real punk then i don't recommend this but if you like greenday, New Found Glory, and other pop punk bands then you'd love it. I also listened to Dude Ranch and if i was forced to listn to Blink 182 I would listen to Dude Ranch."
5,buy this album buy this album buy this album buy this album,"my girlfriend and i love this album! Both of us are massive Cure fans, so accordingly when we heard the Robert Smith track on the new LP we were both blown away. I personally never thought that blink could pull that off credibly. they pulled it with much more than mere credibility; coming together like a zipper; seamlessly. i am really impressed with this album."
4,"I used to hate em, now they're alright","First off, I would like to state that Robert Smith is NOT a sell out like the other person who wrote a review said. The cure has always been all over tv and even has been on Mtv. Oh no.... Anyways, Blink-182 has really grown up and Robert Smith probably respects that and that's why he worked with them. Also, their music is well written on this album. I used to HATE blink-182 because I thought that they're songs never had any meaning and were just stupid, immature songs about stupid things. On this album, however, songs like ""Lost without you"", ""Here's your letter"", and ""Always"" have sentimental value and are written in a more mature state. I think they've finally grown up - and I like it. Their new direction is a very good improvement from their old stuff. Old blink fans may not like it but other people will."
4,"good, good","first of all, if your going to come on this site and complain about what people think and how people type their reviews, then we dont want to her your crap(james). if i want to write ""ur"" instead of ""your"", im going to, and there is nothing you can do about it. and james, if you dont care, neither do we, so take your ranting and raving elsewhere.sorry to get off track. the new blink album is definitley different. they have improved lyric-wise exeptionally, and the fact that they express every instrument(drums, bass, guitar, and vocals) evenly and effectivley and still make the album good is very difficult. to see the band take a new direction is cool, and I think that their style in past albums was absolutley spectacular. its good for bands to change style, it shows what they are capable of. certainly not their best album, but very impressive. if your a blink fan, i say buy it."
5,not a fan for when bands change their style but Blink pulled,"this one off flawlessly. I first heard Feeling This and instantly fell in love with the song so I got the album and it's freakin' great. Definitely different from their old stuff but that stuff all started to sound the same anyway, kiddie, which got boring quickly. This is a fresh change. I don't know why people did not like ""All of This"" cause I thought it was one of the best songs on the cd along with Feeling This and Down. The copy I have now is actually a second copy since my other one was stolen along with my car. This album is that worth it and you know, gotta support the music that you love right?!"
4,Awesome,"Blink always amazes me, and this cd was no exception! At first i missed the old Blink, but the album grew on me and now i have to limit how much i listen to it. One of the best albums i've ever had!"
2,I want my Blink back :-(,"Whoa. I think I'm still in shock. Okay, so maybe its more mature. Maybe its the ""dark side"" of Blink 182. But maybe i dont WANT it to be :-( I respect the changes Blink THOUGHT would be good, but to me it sound like they're just trying to keep up with the all-too-new and rising Emo Punk scene. Some fans will back up Blink, giving excuses that its a ""grown up"" version of them, but I don't think that's good enough. Blink 182 DEFINED pop-punk. Why try to step away from that? It wasn't the jackass stuff they did that drew the audiences, it was the MUSIC! Bring it back blink! Some of the songs still have a little sharp hint of what-used-to-be, put it to good use next time. Make the next album title ""We're Back."" I'll be waiting.But for now, I'll just stick with good ol' Finch or somethin'. See ya when you get back Blink. And have a safe trip back to ""Take Off Your Pants and Enema"" Town (really.. i hope the fans are as forgiving as me..)."
3,Am I the only one hearing this?!,"Alright, alright, I have to give Blink some credit for trying 'cause some parts of afew of the songs are great ya know, but this album just isnt them. It's cool that they wanted to try new things, but I just feel like not that much passion and authentic Blink 182 went into this album. I mean has anyone other than me actually listened to their previous records? Come on! I think that if they would've put a little more time and feeling into this album it would have been so much better. The lyrics now are just meaningless. Some do have feeling, but not very much and on their other albums you listen to the songs and you usually find a song that speaks to you, that you believe was written for you, but I haven't found one yet. All in all this is a cool cd, but it's not really what I had expected. So Blink, I love you but I just dont like this album."
4,pretty darn good!,"this cd surprised ne as i heard that the SELF TITLED album was not good.... its great!! i listened to it continuously for a long while. this cd is really worth gettin if your into pop rock or punk rock. ROCK ON BLINK 183!*""*!!!!!"
1,Raunch,"This CD is nothing but a bunch of fatalistic, immature brats pawning off their filth on the youth culture. They stink."
2,"I never wanna act my age, whats my age again...","oh dear, what has happened. I was highly anticipating this album and after TOYPAJ (which didn't do a lot for me) i thought the next offering would make up for its predacessor but on first listen i thought ""what the...."" just like blink claimed people would do. But after a few listens i realised the tracks stockholm syndrome and violence were very good. But this the truth is blink have go way away from what everyone liked, their energy etc. I also happened to go to one of their latest shows which contained no jokes...NO JOKES IN A 182 SHOW!! Plus the majority of music played was off this album. I really hope blink (if they still can) can make records such as dude ranch and enema again, but if they can't the band that i loved and could most related to have lost it...well i guess this is growing up..."
4,A good read,"This was a good book on the race between the U.S., Britain and Germany to build the first atomic bomb. I read this book as part of my research for a paper and found myself reading it more for enjoyment. A small team of Norwegians was sent into their own country to sabatoge a factory that was producing heavy water, a key ingredient in the atomic research. The tale of their close encounters with death and mission failure was not only griping, but showed the importance of their mission's success."
2,Not recommended.,"If it wasn't for Case knives it wouldn't be much of a book.There is some good basic information, about the same as includedin most knife books. Many many knife makers are not mentioned.I purchase reference books on all my interest and with fewexceptions these books list a great percentage of the totalindustry, not just a few as this book does. It sure could havebeen better described."
1,Don't buy,"Bought two of these in different sizes. They are a waste of time and springs are so stiff that it is not easy to jump in them. I didn't think they would get the height that's shown in the photos, but the photos make it appear easy to jump in and they are not and they can hardly get jump off the ground. My kids are athletic too and they don't like them. Returning them both. Also, kids can sprain an ankle with these."
5,Impressiv representation,"It whas Joyful to watch Jesus of Nazaret , on video and I hope as many of you out there could and would do that too .( starring; Robert Powell and Director: Franco Zeffirelli) Good bless you . Kristín K."
4,You will be moved by this re-enactment.,"This epic captures the life and times of JESUS better than any I have seen to date. Although there are long periods of silence throughout the film, and Powell appears a bit weak and slow to respond at times, it makes an excellent attempt to tell the story with very believable, although sometimes embellished, human settings and responses. The passion is particularly human and emotionally powerful. The singing and dancing at the Last Supper, combined with the scenes with Judas and the high priests, the denial and repentance of Peter, and the reactions of the soldiers, the crowds, and Jesus' mother Mary at the cross are magnificently acted and seeringly realistic. This video should be shown on Palm Sunday or Easter every year. There is none better."
5,A God inspired film,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this is probably the best Jesus film around. I saw this movie when it was first released amid lots of conflict and controversy. I wrote the network a letter letting them know how much I enjoyed it and how I thought it was probably the most accurate portrayal of Jesus I had seen. Of course we are going by what is told in the Bible. I received a letter back from Robert Powell thanking me for my kind words. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I really can't understand the negative comments unless people are just not seeing the whole movie. I have had family members come to Christ and get saved after seeing this movie and I remember hearing that those in the movie were also touched. I recommend it to Christians and non-Christians alike. I watch it at least once a year and see something different each time. Thank you for a great movie! It has definitely stood the test of time."
4,This great film needs top quality technical updating,The film is great -probably my favorite Jesus film of all time.Which is why it deserves a serious technical upgrade.Go back to the original film and re-process the sound and visuals so this classic can be enjoyedwith 2010 technical expertise.
4,Onias,"Aunque es mejor de lo que ya se ha visto en televisión, esta versión aun no es re-masterizada. Creo que debemos seguir esperando por la VERDADERA edición digitalizada del film original. De todos modos la versión lanzada es recomendable ya que incorpora el audio español (latino)."
5,This is a Great movie,I really get into Jesus of Nazareth since I am Catholic is a Good movie to watch to learn about Jesus.
4,Most wonderful version of the life of Christ,"This is the one movie version of the life, death and resurrection of Christ that I have truly loved watching. I would recommend watching Jesus of Nazareth by anyone who truly wishes to learn more of the story of His birth, life, and interaction with His disciples--and how He was so cruelly crucified, ultimately for all of mankind's sake--then, who wish to thrill at how death could not overpower and contain Him, because they believe Him to actually be Who He claimed to be--the Son of the Living God."
5,"Beautiful,Inspiring Movie","This is an exceptional movie about Jesus,the Christ.I've bought it twice,this time to replace one lost to a home fire,I wouldn't want to be without it.It's beautifully done,the appearances of those playing the parts are quite believable in my view.There are parts that stray from the Bible description of the event,but it isn't terribly so in most areas.It is though a beautiful film,the costumes,scenery,all look so right.I've seen many films about Jesus,many are too rough in appearance,some too ""soft"" this one is my very favourite,if you are looking for a film about Jesus that will inspire,and almost transport you to a time long ago I suggest this is a must have.It's a classic,I'll never tire of watching it!"
5,A wonderful tribute to our Lord,"I think this is the best film on Christ, even slightly better than ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" which has lots of sentimental value. This is a masterpiece & HIGHLY recommended! If you're not a believer & you want a good introduction to the life of the only one who can save you, this is a great way to begin your journey. The master tapes that this dvd were produced from must not be in the best shape; I have found that several of Artisan's releases are very spotty compared to the clear view provided by others. This has a lot of blemishes for some reason; maybe it couldn't be cleaned up any more. For quality of the film though, you can't go wrong!"
2,DVD Purchase (Wrong Region),"The DVD is fine, however there was no indication that I would be purchasing a DVD that will not work in my region. No warnings. So the DVD is useless in any Region 4 players. (Not everyone lives in region 1).Not satisfied!"
4,Very Accurate,"Jesus of Nazareth portrays a Jesus who is very much like the Jesus of the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.It is very accurate to the Biblical story, though it does its own thing now and then."
2,Disappointing,I saw it on TV and was very disappointed. Bible passages when quoted are not done so in Biblical order or context. That is just the beginning. The Jesus film is much better.
3,Should've been released in its original WIDE screen format,"One of the great biblical movies, on DVD it should be presented in it's original widescreen format."
4,One of Wharton's greatest sequences,"Whatever you think of ""The Reef,"" it contains one of Edith Wharton's most wonderful scenes. Our ""hero"" has been dallying for a while in a hotel with the young girl he picked up on the boat dock, and he's wearying of her. We see his boredom and disillusionment through his reactions to the mere sounds she is making in the next room. He is so familiar by now with her habits and movements that he knows what she's doing without actually seeing her. A gem of a scene, in a strange jewel of a book."
1,Eco-idolatry,"The legitimate concern to respect our planet should not lead us to adore the planet, as the good father argues. Even in a rain forest the Creator is not the creature.Upper middle-class confusion."
5,Well worth the time to read this book!,"I found this book to be well worth the time. It has some errors in typing, but, overall, the errors were only minor distractions. I quite enjoy reading historical accounts of events, and Daniel DeFoe did an excellent job of relating the emotions, beliefs, and attitudes of the people of that time. I gained a new perspective on the people who endured that year in London. The fears and the reality of the experience as related in these pages touched me as few books have."
2,Boring,I generally enjoy older books but this was very boring. I was interested in it for its historical information but I found myself skimming the pages. Lots of pages of mundane details. Skip this book.
4,"Superb performances YES, Re-master NO!","This collection is a very good representation of Supertramp's best, and is an excellent buy for anyone still needing to add Supertramp to their collection. However, buyer beware . . .I just ordered this disc (from Amazon), and it has copyright 1990 on the disc, booklet, and back cover. It was certainly not produced in 2001 as stated by Amazon and at least one reviewer.In addition, the booklet carries this notation: ""This complilation was taken from the original masters of previouisly released album tracks and singles..."". If taken from the original masters it can't possibly be a remaster!"
5,Epic science fiction,"I love Catherine Asaro's range--she can do everything from narrowly focused, character-based stories to a vast, complicated epic like The Radiant Seas, where she expertly weaves multiple story lines together, without losing track of the individuals involved. All this plus good science (though admittedly some of it is over my liberal arts head.) I'm thoroughly hooked on the Skolian Empire and look forward to the next entry in Asaro's series."
1,"More of a pamphlet, not a book","I was very disapointed with this ""book"". It is barly more than a pamphlet and should not be considered a book. What information is in it is more on the scientific level and not really designed for the layman. I would not recomend this pamphlet for a collector looking to determine if an ivory piece is real or a fake. I read the entire pamphlet in about 15 minutes and would not be able to determine if any of my pieces were authentic."
5,Brilliant!,"I have yet to find such an enjoyable CD! This is packed with high-energy danceable tunes from start to finish (excluding Only Ones Who Know). Maybe not quite the same Arctic Monkeys you knew from Whatever People Say, but this change of pace is very much welcomed. Every track is catchy, in some respect, whether it be the vocals or the guitar riffs. There isn't a single track I don't like on here."
2,"""Looks like the Mach 5 was in a crash""","I already have MANY versions of this series, from the Japanese original to the speedracer.com mystery release (that never got released). I bought this because I thought the the Mach 5 case would be cool. Don't be fooled by the stock image!THE CASE IS NOT COOL, very shoddy, looks like the Mach 5 was just in a crash. The door metal is bent, and not from shipping damage, just a really crappy pressing. The printing on the wheels is awful. So much for the collector's case. Oh well... I can only hope that the crappy version becomes rare or something ;)Skip this version, I will probably return mine, if I see that there is a better ""run"" on store shelves."
5,SPEED RACER GO GO GO,!!!A great item at a fantastic price!!! I picked up mine for $32 and it was the complete series with the episodes having the complete 1960s beginings and endings and as a bonus it included the Speed Racer Next Generation movie...All the disks come packed in a very well made Tin Speed Racer car so for the price you can not beat it...
2,nothing new!,"some parts, of this gig, are very nice, many others very boring and ... she talks too much, often get bored with repetitive phrases.The show is overwhelming but it is not anything new, everything already seen!"
1,save your money,just what you'd expect. an overrated madonna wannabe...and that's coming from someone who doesn't even like madonna. everything about her is fake.
3,Item Shipped Was Not What Was Listed,"This is a great show but the original listing of this item, when I ordered it a week ago, stated that it was blu-ray. Now it seems to have been changed to DVD. Very disappointing."
5,"Gaga Great....BEST, even!","This dvd concert takes the 'on lookers' inside her world, then when the concert starts, you are THERE....One of many concerts, I own, but this gal, screams....I am the one to overcome and here I sit, as queen....LADY? YES! I LOVE MY LADY GAGA! FOREVER, yours, Lady....I shall, always, love your music and songs, FOREVER!"
3,Enjoyable for fans of the genre,"Better game than I expected. Graphics aren't too great, but what do you expect? This game could have Bioshock graphics and still wouldn't get any sales. Low popularity = Low sales = Low budget = Poor graphics. That's like saying a bowling game should have good visuals. Gamers that are hunting fans will like this game. Your average gamer probably will not. I'm not even a hunter, but when it comes to shooting animals in a game, count me in!"
2,The Pilgrimage,This was selected as our book of the month by my bookclub. I was very disappointed. Found the book very heavy going and fairly unconvincing and not at all entertaining.
4,A Very Different Pilgrimage,"This is the first book by this author I have read. I bought two others at the same time. While I am very familiar with some of the terrain and locations that the book covers, I was, admittedly, surprised by the story. If you are in to symbols and mysterious rituals, this is a fine book and a good experience. If you want the ""Santiago Experience,"" you might want to think again. Overall, I enjoyed the story and the characters."
5,A spiritual journey,"Follow Mr. Coelho along the Camino de Santiago! It's his personal story on this old pilgrimage road and while sometimes it borders on unbelievable, it's inspiring! It seems that something special happens to everyone who walks this road. This book will honestly make you want to go on this religious pilgrimage! While I'm not overly religious, I love reading stories about people traveling to new places. And this book is so much fun to read because Paulo encounters all types of people and animals. If you're on the fence about this book, don't be. Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down."
2,Am I missing something?,Having completed the camino de santiago and read this book I see no relation between the two. One reviewer said that maybe something had been lost in translation-this may be a tactful way of saying that this book is actually tedious and vastly over rated.The setting is the camino but frankly could have been anywhere else as specific references seem to be lacking-and are probably irelevant to the story.I also found some of the mystical aspects just plain mumbo jumbo-maybe it's just me or maybe others did not like this book but are afraid to be critical of such a 'great' book.
5,the pilgrimage is inspiring,"i just finished reading the first book ever published by Paulo Coelho : the Pilgrimage! I have read the Alchemist, Brida, and Down by the River Piedra... and found this book to be my second favourite so far (the Alchemist being #1 of course). I found this book very inspirational and it touches on almost every aspect of life. The writter is actually the main character and it is Paulo's own journey that we are also embarking on. I often found myself wondering, 'did this really happen to him?'. But whether it did or not is irrelevant, since it is the central message of ""fighting the good fight"" and all that we must be mindful of in doing so, that is really important! It was hard to put this book down and I loved reading every minute of it! I truly felt a connection with the writer and at the end of the book felt as though i too could fight my own ""good fight""!"
3,A good book by a great author,I read this book and enjoyed it. I didn't understand all the Swords and Sorcers stuff or the Midevil magic. I do beleive that Mr. Coelho believes it and that's what counts. I plan on doing the Camino and hope my experiances are half as good as his were and that I get out of it what he did. There's only one way to find out. It's worth the time to read.
2,Second Comments on This Book,"I wrote a review of this book in Feb 1999. Since that time I have walked El Camino, October/November 1999. I must say that Coelho's book has prompted many Brazilians to make the adventurous trip. However, most of the refuge hospitaleros had criticism of the book, not only because of the mystical content, but because he did not finish the journey by walking. On the other hand, they also critize bicyclists. I still don't like the mystical part, but he has made people think about the journey and that is a positive point. It's also good for Spain in its attempt to promote culture."
1,"Reviewing Kindle pricing, not the book","Amazon, it is nothing less than ridiculous that delivering a handful of electrons should cost 30% more than a hard-copy of this book. What are you thinking?"
3,Re-Review,"I must amend my previous review of this book. While the book is entertaining it expounds the idea that we must use forces outside ourselves (magic) to achieve what we want. Magic is strictly prohibited in the Bible, the Torah and the Koran. It is labeled a form of idolatry. For those searching for themselves I would recommend the reading of John Gray's ""How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."" God's speed in your journey."
4,"good, not great","It's informative, but take it in small doses or you'll fall asleep. This video is for those with basic writing problems. Advanced writers should look elsewhere. What is nice about the video, which is why I gave it 4 stars, is that it provides free lessons you can download and print. Watch a portion of the video, complete a short lesson, and move on to the next portion/lesson. Another great thing about this video is that it's accurate. Is it worth more than $20? No, not at all. This item is overpriced. It would be worth more if it were more engaging."
4,A review,"I enjoyed this book a great deal, it was more dense tha I had anticipated but very entertaining, with three-dimensional characters.My one problem was that, in all honesty, I didn't particularly see why I, as a reader, should be more in favor of Gwyneth over Branion, when Rhys didn't seem like a much more favorable choice than his father. The theocratic aspects were very interesting, but on a personal level, I thought that the main characters had something lacking. Ms. Patton's minor characters and adversaries were far more compelling. I found myself hoping for Drusus and Calliston to be victorious instead.Even so, I enjoyed the overall tone and feel of the book and look forward to reading more of her work."
2,Ick.,"Tediously slow. The details are details for the sake of being details. The details in this book do not enhance and bring forth an awesome plot or anything like that. They're just there. Like great blocks of granite thrown by a giant's child, they're just there. They don't form a pyramid, a great monument, or anything. They exist just because--there's not much of a reason for such excessive detail. It's kind of like Stone Prince. Barely better. I had bought three of the Patton books because the covers looked interesting and the details, when skimmed, looked ok. However, after I read these, I couldn't stand them any longer and gave them to Pocketbook so they could deal with these things."
5,PERFECT,"The best Hoffmann ever!GEDDA is just perfect. Although I very much like Domingo but his Hoffmanns (Bonygne - Ozawa )are disgrace!!A baritone Nicklausse may seem odd but when you hear Benoit you don't even think of a mezzo.The rest of the cast are as good as one would guess and you can not find any Olympia more lovebale than Gianna D'Angelo.Above all it is unbelievable how Cluytens manages the Orchestra.The only drawback may be that George London's a little dry-voiced here.I say again : ""JUST PERFECT"" ."
1,Works almost - Over heating is a problem,"As others have noted, this unit's temperature sensor is not functional. I have several of these units installed and they heat well but just can't control how much! It keeps warm over night but during the day the room has reached over 85 and the heaters are still going. I finally had to use an external room temperature sensor to turn the Flat-Panels on and off. And the power switch. They put a silicone cover to keep out moisture. But it interferes with the switch. It takes some skill to finally make sure it power is on or off."
5,Perfect in every way,"This is a shortened version of the service heard around the world every Christmas Eve, but not less valuable for that. The length is just right for casual or even serious listening (Stephen Cleobury has recorded the whole service on 2 CDs). The Ledger years don't get as much notice as the Willcocks or Cleobury years. It may be that it was simply too difficult to follow Sir David Willcocks. But the Choir is a living institution, and Philip Ledger and the choir are first rate in this recording of Lessons and Carols. Some details from your Oxford Book of Carols are different. Ledger wrote some of his own descants, and also arranged some of the carols. The service as a whole is simply magic, and you won't notice a missing lesson or carol. I wrap presents to this on Christmas Eve. Or take this out in July, turn down the air conditioning, and let it rip."
4,Another great adventure story!,This was a better read than the 1st book that Kane and Co. come across that dastardly troll dude that they met in PARRALLAX RED. This was abetter adventure story than that one though. The people who like this series should be pleased.
4,A tribute to the asteroids and comets hunters,"A very good book to anyone that desires to acquire a good glimmer about the subject of Near Earth Objects and their threat to our civilization.It covers all aspects from technical to politics and is a real tribute to many dedicated professionals and amateurs astronomers, geologist and others various scientists which are making history in asteroid and comets hunting. It also make me disapointed to know that the Southern hemisphere, were I live, is like a blind concerning the NEOs search effort.Only one aspect prevent me too score 5 stars: In my opinion, the too long discussion on chapter 8 about he streetlights issue of San Diego.A wonderful start book for anyone who intend to initiate in the NEOs study."
4,"12"" Lappy cover","My wife loves her case. We've upgraded computers since we bought this, but it really worked nicely for 2 years. The case deteriorated at the corners, but that's because my wife is really tough on her belongings. I am no exception."
5,A stunning evocative and instantly recognisable audio treat,"Instantly recognisable, emotionaly intrusive, Perman transports you to the Iberian peninsual with playing of such an expressive nture that we almosrt crashed the car when we heard it for the first time. Unmissable"
1,"PetMate ""Quality"" Is A Thing of the Past.","What a difference two years make. The ""same"" new PetMate heating pad that arrived today weighs about half as much as the first one that I ordered from Amazon less than two years ago. Thin corrugated plastic (a little heavier than a plastic straw) covers the cord on the new one vs. a coated corrugated metal that covers the old cord. Also, the new heating pad has the ""PetMate"" name stamped on it, but came in a box that had a generic brand name - No mention of ""PetMate"". I purchased PetMate, expecting a durable, quality product. What I received today from Amazon appears to be a cheap, disposable product. Shame on Amazon and PetMate! No more Amazon Petmate orders from this multiple pet owner."
5,Great Product,"This stripping comb is perfect. No need to go out and buy an expensive comb to groom your wire haired dog. This price is great and it's a well made combo and does a great job! I highly recommend it but before you use it, it's important to know how to use it. I have a small 12 pound terrier who had never been groomed and I stripped her in less than 15 minutes."
3,"Simon Pegg was my reason to watch, but it's no Shaun or Hot Fuzz","Run, Fatboy, Run was funny at times, but it was also generic and a little too sweet for my tastes. Simon Pegg is a natural talent and one of my favorite comic actors, but even he can't make this movie anything special. The love story has been done what seems like a million times before, but there are enough amusing moments to give it three stars. I would skip it until you can watch it for free on TV.The Blu-ray does have a very nice picture and sound quality, but the extra features are lacking. There are quite a few deleted scenes and a commentary track, but not much more."
2,"Has it's moments, but...","I've seen Simon Pegg in a few things now, and he's undeniably likeable, normal, and not afraid to embarrass himself. Unfortunately, his talent is wasted here. Absolutely anyone could have been plugged into these roles to make your average ""funny tale of redemption"" movie. It's unconvincing and predictable in equal amounts. If you don't see all of the plot points coming from a mile away, you may not be old enough to read this yet. And I'm a big fan of Nike, but their rampant product placement throughout this one will drive you up the wall. Did they finance the entire film or what? At least it's not a crass or mean-spirited film in any way; it might make a good enough date movie to stay in and watch. But considering the lack of chemistry with the actors, it's formulaic nature, and the fact that it's just not that funny, you could do a lot better than ""Run Fatboy, Run""."
5,Run Fat Boy Run,Great movie. Thoroughly enjoyable and family friendly. I will recommend this movie to my running friends as we can relate to the trials and excitment of participating in huge running events.
2,I TOUGHT IT WAS A BETTER MOVIE,"BUT IS NOT SHE IS A GOOD ACCTRESS ,BUT THE WAY THIS MOVIE ITS BEEN MADE, IT MAKE IT A SHORT STORY, WAY TO LONG , NAD IT IS KIND OF STUPID TO FOLLOW , A TAPE RECORDER ALL ALONG, TO END UP HEADING NORTH, DISSAPPOINTED"
5,Enjoying the Whole Black Jack Experience,"Mr. Pappadopoulos' first book allowed me to enjoy Black Jack as a table experience. It gave me the confidence I needed and some extra spending money.This book broadens the experience to include the whole casino and take advantage of its perks (""comps"" in casino jargon).Definitely worth much, much more than the cost of the book.His easy writing style make his insights and experiences easy to grasp and internalize."
2,Disappointing,The author seems more interested in sharing his political judgments than he is in explaining what happened in the Balkans in the 1990s. What a waste.
1,RED ALERT!!!,"if you have a little girl, please do not let them read this book. i don't know what the writer was thinking....these stuff she be left for the parents to talk about to their kids. of course they are going to learn things outside too but to read it in a kid's book is awful and distasteful in my eyes. it talks about SEX, SPERM, TOUCHIHNG BOOBS, taking OFF BRAS, etc....if you are good parent and want your kids to read a book then stay away from this sexually exploited book. someone should ban this whole series for little girls!!!"
1,Graphical Sexual Content!,"My 8 year old daughter brought this home from the school library and I was OUTRAGED. I could not believe that it talks about a man's parts ""squirting"" sperm inside woman's parts (and yes, they use the REAL names of these parts). It even says things like where they do it ""over a toilet?""...""in the tub""....""in the backyard""...., ""Ill bet its mess"", to how long it lasts ""a couple of minutes""....""however long a couple wants it to"". TOTALLY inappropriate for third graders! The author puts reading for 9-12 year olds, which is 3rd grad on up - I COMPLETELY disagree. This story is in the news in Arizona on channel 15 and channel 5. The schools need to either put a 6th grade sticker on it or pull it from their shelves!"
5,good opera,"This transfer of the 1951 Bayreuth recording to CD is soso. The bassoon at the second act can barely be heard. The EMI recording is out of print. The supplier was fine, it is the tape to CD transfer I am criticising. It is a dream cast for the first post-war Wagner festival."
2,Not worth the extra money,"MY husband and I have purchased several of the basic Riedel whisky glasses. They are wonderful -- especially for those who love their single malts. However, the Sommeliers series was four times the price for exactly the same glass -- only thinner. As a result they shatter very easily. Save your money and go with the basic line. SOmetimes less is not more."
1,Why drink more lead?,"All these glasses offer is more lead, which - last I checked - isn't very good for you. Be assured that any fine single malt tastes exactly the same out of glasses that costs a fraction of the price. Go with regular whiskey glassware and I guarantee you won't know the difference -- heck, you'll probably even live 10 years longer!"
4,Basics for Beginners,"This is just the kind of book that I needed. I've been photographing for a long time with 35mm camera, and have considered going digital. But, this book has helped me understand how a scanner works, and shows me how I can get great quality scanning my 35 mm prints and slides. The step by step photos and simple explanations are very helpful.I think that the book is a little overpriced for only 96 pages, which is why I rate it 4 stars."
1,Poor results,"Bought as a christmas gift and the bottle was poorly packaged and it arrived broken on my footsteps. I don't see any options listed to return it for a refund or at least exchange it like the some of the other products has listed. Disappointed in the results and only about 3/4 is left and the top is broken, there is absolutely no way I can give this a gift."
5,I love this perfume!,I have worn no other perfume but Tatiana since 1980! It has a beautiful light (yet noticeable) floral fragrance (primarily jasmine) that is not overbearing or annoying to those around you. I have tested other perfumes out of curiosity and will purchase nothing else but Tatiana.
3,First by this author,"I thought the mystery in this book was very good. What got me was the main character who let everyone just walk all over him. Beaumont was a rug. His partner/ex partner/sarge/interviewees/friends/sponsors/enimies (even the heater in the building he lives in), treated him like crap and he while he fumes over it a little, he justifies their actions, and allow this behavior to continue. This doesn't make for a very compelling read."
5,Jance Does It Again!,"J.A. Jance's ""Payment in Kind"" is a great story. Again featuring one of the author's main protagonists, J.P. Beaumont, Jance weaves a spellnbinding trail that keeps the reader on edge and suspecting almost all of the characters in the story at one point or another; just as you are absolutely sure you know who did it -- you discover it wasn't them! Keeps you moving to the very last chapter.One of the finest mystery writers today; a wonderful charcter (literally and figuratively) in Beaumont!"
1,FORGET THE COMMENTARY,This film was purchased for a Brazilian studies class. The film is ruined by the commentaries throughout the entire movie. You cannot hear the lilting Brazilian Portuguese in the background.
5,A MASTERPIECE! The best Brazilian film ever!!!,"5 stars is not enough to classified this great film! With a great direction, by Walter Salles, great cinematography, wonderful original score, divine screenplay and the best role played by Fernanda Montenegro, the biggest actress in Brazil, this film was simply made with heart to those who have hearts! For me, THE BEST FILM OF 90's!!! There's no other that has the quality and the Beauty of this! I'm proud of being brazilian, watching this film! It shows my country like it realy is, with lots of problem, but with people touched by heart! Thank you Walter for a marvellous work! And Fernanda Montenegro, the Oscar doesn't deserve your magnitude! You're the best in 1998 for sure!"
5,This is simply the life itself...,It proves that you do not need millions of dollars to make a perfect film ! A simple story but it touches so deeply that it makes you think about the meaning of your life..
5,"Vivid images, captivating story of heart and soul","Fernanda Montenegro was superb in the performance as a letter writer for the illiterate in central station. Dora performs this job in a perfunctory manner, sharing content with a friend, mocking, criticizing, choosing which letters to actually send. She is cold and impersonal. She feels obligated for a young boy whose mother just died and after ""selling"" him to an unsavory orphanage she retrieves him. Dora's plight is filled with her own pain of the ""drunkard"" of a father who abandoned her and the death of her own mother. And so, the journey begins to get Joshue back to his father regardless of his reputation. Wonderful images and realism of life in Brazil project. Great human interest story! Great performances by Fernanda and the child."
4,Very worthy contribution to the roadtrip genre,"I had always thought that U.S. writers would stick to the roadtrip (e.g., ""On the Road"") and the Latins would stick to magical realism. I've been happily surprised by the results of their poaching on the American genre. Recently I watched ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and found it excellent. Like YTMT, ""Central Station"" is cut in the classic mold of the roadtrip, where transformation flows from the trip itself and the characters met on it. This movie come highly recommended. Its only detraction is the ending, which could have occurred in any of the last three scenes and which was a little too melodramatic."
5,Like a walk through the Met,Bywaters' illustrations breathe. There is not a dead corner anywhere. A world of such richly realized detail that you easily forget much of it is fantasy.
1,"Drink your stone out ,or is it?","Do not follow this teaching.This is completely dangerous .Just goggle this subject , you will be surprise.You don't just drink your stone out.Fake, fake,fake.Be warned,be smart."
5,excellent,"it is helping me to take care of my health myself, after taking a medication that almost destroyed my liver. Plenty of useful information. The liver flush does work. I will keep doing what the author teaches to improve my health. There should be more books like this."
5,Awesome Complete Box Set,"MS Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Anime Legends Complete Box is great overall.It is actually 355 minutes long, NOT 335 minutes. It comes with alot of bonus clips that run an average of 3 minutes. These bonus clips are about how the UC colonies started building in space, how The Principality of Zeon started, their Zeon mobile suits, and about an overview of Mobile Suit Gundam series. It also has the Mobile Suit/Vehicles/Characters Encyclopedia of the 08th MS Team series. The box set is thin, like a regular single DVD box, but contains 5 discs. 4 discs contain all 12 episodes, and the 5th disc contains Miller's Report.The animation itself is awesome, and in my opinion, is better than or on par with the animation of Gundam Seed or Gundam 00.The only thing that disappoints me is that it does not have Widescreen."
1,A good idea,"But, frankly, it doesn't work. The editor feature, which was the main attraction for me, is awkward and severely flawed in implementation. The developing company is now out of business, so don't look for any support. For more fun (and for the same amount of time), take the money this game would cost, drop it in the toilet, flush and cheer as it goes its merry way."
3,Symbolic logic still useful,"Probably is not often taught any more as it has been replaced by other methods, still has use because it teaches alternate methods and formats of solving logic problems. Since this book was not written recently the language can be a bit confusing, but otherwise is a quick and somewhat enjoyable read."
2,Sloppy soloist performance and terrible recording,"I agree with reviewer ts9641. Kennedy is very sloppy (also during the final movement's cadenza during the fast loud passages he has upper harmonics that come lashing out and hurt my ears. This is due to a combination of poor soloist technique and the poor distant recording technique. Kennedy does do well during the slow movement and creates an ethereal feeling. However, one can't escape that the overall recording is terrible. I had to turn the volume way up to even hear the violin at the proper concert level but then when the orchestra gave its tuttis, the orchestra was way too loud. The overall recorded sound was too distant and muffled and lacked details. However, the orchestral performance is very good, so I give this 2 stars instead of 1. I'm going to try the Heifetz, Hilary Hahn and Tasmin Little recordings soon and I will update this review with comparisons."
5,Expertly woven romantic tale,"This expertly woven romantic tale is an enjoyable reading experience. The author keeps the plot moving, focused on Lila, Paul and the twins. She tugs at our hearts with warm and fuzzy familial love; while making our heart skip a beat with the steamy shower scenes between alien Lila and Dr. Paul. The character development is amazing,,,evidence of the author's active imagination. Loved, loved, loved reading this page turner. Judy McCoy is very talented. I look forward to reading all of her future novels.Arlene Millmanauthor of ""Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy"" and""Forever Love and More, Encore"""
5,A Masterpiece,"If I were going to buy only one dog training book this would be it. I especially liked the first chapter and the section on Planet Gorn (Chapter 4). I'm not comfortable using pain to train pet dogs, so I really appreciate her painless techniques and the way she goes beyond myths and examines the real science and evidence."
3,"Great content, poor organization and editing","Jean's book is a must read for the content. The information she provides is extremely valuable. In particular the information on the natural behavior of dogs and theory of operant conditioning. Five stars for content. However, the general organization needs help. In the early portion of the book she mixes theory with practical training drills making the theory hard to follow and the drills hard to find later. Her sentence structure is sometimes ponderous and difficult to read through. Two stars for organization and editing."
5,Best book on dog behavior I've ever read,"I considered myself pretty progressive regarding dog training and behavior and then I read this book and realized I needed to update my thinking even more. The book is so good I bought 5 more to give to my friends with dogs. I STRONGLY recommend it to anyone who owns a dog. It is really worth the read. After you read this book, then move on to clicker training books - especially anything by Karen Pryor. Using clicker training (discussed in Culture Clash as well), I was able to train my 7 week old Aussie puppy how to sit, down, give paw, ""attention,"" and ""touch"" (target) my hand, in about 3-5 minutes for each command. If you love your dogs, read these books and train them well."
3,Shame on the publisher,"Jean Donaldson has some interesting things to say, no doubt. But her publisher has hobbled this book by including NO INDEX and a pathetic table of contents.Imagine this scenario: Fido's just knocked your child over. You remember something in the book that might help you correct this situation, but how do you find it? You can't! You're doomed to skimming through several chapters, and you'll likely give up before you find it.This book was published in 1997, and is highly recommended by many dog trainers. Hello, publisher! Surely it's worth hiring an indexer for a few hundred bucks."
1,was not happy with Culture Clash,"I was so excited to get this book and after calling all of the local book stores and finding out they were all out, I had to order it and wait 2 long weeks to recieve it!! The book finally came and I was sooo happy..tearing through the box it was mailed in...I got comfy on my chair and read it....chapter by chapter..I was so excited in the first 10 minutes,then...uggg...I was so disapointed....The writing was all disorganized..I was totally lost..and there was no index!!!! I put the book down and am planning on selling it in my yard sale next month."
5,Horse- what!,"The reader who gave this book 1 star and called it horsehockey recommends books by Carol Benjamin and The Monks of New Skete. Both of these authors condone violence against dogs in the name of ""training"" and I do NOT recommend them for anyone who does not want to hit, strangle or hang their dog up by the neck until it passes out.Culture Clash is for intelligent readers who want to train with gentleness, using proven training techniques. They WORK, but only if you use them properly.Anyone who can't get a dog to learn using these techniques is doing it wrong, plain and simple."
4,book,"has a lot of good information on dog behavior and I learned a lot, but the author at times can be a little hard to understand she first a dog behavior trainer and author second. But I havent read many dog training books so I have nothing to compare it too. But it was still a good book"
3,GLOSSARY INDEX?,"I agree with most of the reviews, however, this is a book that is not for the novice dog owner who wants to teach their dog basic obedience. For that it's too intense and heavy reading. The most annoying thing about the book (especially for dog trainers who would like to refer back to something) is that there is NO INDEX! REALLY??? How terribly inconvenient.For novice dog owners: After you've put yourself and your dog through a basic obedience course at your local Petco, pick up ""Don't shoot the dog"" for instance."
1,Vegetarian Times,I have yet to receive my first issue so I am unable to review. I have read other issues previously and enjoyed the magazine but I am disappointed in the length of time it has taken to receive my first issue.
2,Slow delivery of magazine,I ordered a magazine in early NOvember and here it is December and I have not yet received a copy.
1,Not yet received.,"I have not yet received a single issue of this magazine. I am still waiting, but I did see that the fees for the magazine went out of my card.This is bad!"
2,This Ole Mare Ain't What She Used To Be...,"Vegetarian since 1980, Vegan since 1990. Loved this magazine back then, when it really was a monthly treat for us. Read it cover-to-cover the moment it arrived in my mailbox.Then it changed. Suddenly, few, if any, vegan recipes. The ""vegetarian"" ones started to contain fish! LOL, since when did fish be considered plant food? Unbelievable. After calling and writing to deaf ears and blind eyes, I let my subscription expire.Now it isn't even published monthly? Just nine issues for a one-year subscription? Sheesh. Sad.Two stars for omnivores to begin an exploration of cruelty-free eating, but it is no ""bible"". Read anything by John Robbins, especially, ""Diet for A New America"". That is what made me go vegan. Yes, he was to be heir to the Baskin-Robbins fortune, but he forsake that.God Bless you, John, and thank you for making a delightful difference.Diet for a New America"
4,Helpfuful and Healthy,It is a grreat magazine. I have bought it at newsstands for years .i always find the articles very helpful.
5,A Keeper,"Great Mag, will continue with subscription, lots of wonderful recipes and ideas..great mag if your are vegetarian or wish to implement more veggie meals into your diet....YUM"
5,My forever magazine,I have been getting Vegetarian times since I became vegetarian in 1981. There have been a lot of changes since then. I always like the articles and LOVE the recipes. I do wish there were still 12 a year instead of 9. I guess this is a subscription I will continue getting for many years.
4,Excellent Magazine,This magazine is a much read for vegetarians who are interested in new and interesting recipes and articles!
1,Vegetarian Times is really lame and not vegan friendly...,"Vegetarian Times is pretty lame. It is not very vegan friendly, take no issues on vegetarian issues and many of the recipes are so filled with dairy or eggs that they are unhealthful....VegNews is a much better magazine as is Vegetarian Journal. I have subscribed to Vegetarian Times since 1984 and am letting my subscription lapse this year. I find nothing in the magazine interesting...and am also annoyed that many of the ads in the magazine are for non-vegetarian products...."
1,Where money is more important than values.,"I've read and have been a subscriber for years. Vegetarian for most of my life.The magazine goes through editors like we go through soy milk. They just can't find their way it seems.These days, most recipes call for expensive and / or hard to find ingredients. Worse, some call for pre-made items that just can't be found. Case in point, the latest issue with the very yummy looking pizza on the cover? You will not find the recipe for the crust in the magazine. Funny, eh? Also, the magazine, for the most part, ignores the male reader.After all this time, I'm saying farewell to VT. With a host of wonderful blogs on the net, and amazing cooks who generously share there ""secrets"", I'll save the trees it takes to produce this advertising biased magazine.Update 7/3/12The magazine now sells ad space that highlight items that are NOT vegetarian. (Solgar No. 7, in the most recent issue.)"
1,Glossy front cover does not hold much content.,"Very disappointed with this magazine subscription despite the gorgeous glossy front covers. Content is scant and recipes are not great tasting. I've been a vegetarian for several yrs and was looking for some decent recipes. But don't expect it from this publication. Recipes does not seem to have been tested for taste. Futhermore, delivery is sporatic at best. My Jan and Feb issues went missing (and that was not the first time this happened). After contacting them, I was promised replacement issues would be sent. They never appeared. My subscription ends in May and I can't wait to try another publication. What a waste of money and time."
3,Nice idea,"A great idea to keep a cane off from the floor but, it is a little stiff to pull out sometimes. I found it was easily bumped and landed on the floor anyway."
4,"A dark, very dark comedy","A dark--very dark--and violent comedy told from the viewpoint of a mob gunmen. Charlie Swift's boss is slowly getting pushed out of business in Florida. Charlie tries to figure out why, and the role a set of accounting books has to play in it all. The cast of characters includes fellow thugs and gunmen, a senile boss, a girlfriend who is a taxidermist/avant-garde artist, crooked and honest FBI agents. The violence is all very unrealistic and over the top. But it makes for great reading!Gischler is an engaging writer, and has excellent characterization throughout the novel. Even with first person narration, there is very little exposition. Character is revealed through dialogue and actions."
4,melissa & doug do a great job again,"solid build great fun for a young boy who loves to build or loves airplaneswill last and not break ina week , good grab bag pick , would recomend"
1,audio and video out of sinc!!,"My experience was poor because the video was out of sinc with voice, way off for two of the episodes. I switched to youtube and their were no tech. probs."
3,Enjoyable,"We enjoy White Collar, it has humor, mystery and unexpected turns. The characters are likeable and complex. The acting is well done, and the story lines have remained interesting."
2,Going downhill in the annuals of suspense,"First Kate had to die,Then Alex, Sarah and the Treasure seemed to fizzle,Neil's Father search has been like taking a cold shower on a freezing day ...The taxi medalion and Cotton Club caper was the worst ever.I thing Neil, Peter, and Mozzie need a new batch of writers .... things are getting BORING!"
5,yes we do,My wife and I love Neil and Peter and the way they work so well together in this show with out question
5,Always enjoy watching this show,Episdoes of White Collar are consistently good. They are funny and its the kind of show you want to watch to unwind at the end of a long day.
5,Great!,Loved the season openers. Had to go back and catch these because I missed them earlier. Now can't wait for the season to begin again in January.
5,AWESOME!!!,White Collar is one of the best shows on TV. Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay are so awesome together!! They really make you feel for their characters and have me laughing all the time. They rock!!
5,One of our favorite shows that the whole family can enjoy,Great ensemble cast supported by good writing and a cliffhanger at the end of each episode keep you wanting to watch more.
4,Not the best episode,It feels like the writers are running out of ideas. I couldn't help but compare this episode to another much better one on insider trading. And the far-fetched idea about Peter and Neal boxing? It must have been dragged in by the head and shoulders.
4,Don't ask - Don't tell,"I love the series White Collar. The slight lack of trust between Peter and Neal add to the problem at hand in this end of season episode. The fact that Peter gave Neal specific instructions about what to let his father know was hindered by the fact that he never questioned Neal when he thought he had breached their agreement. Neal is upset with Peter about his father and doesn't let him know when he is going to see him. Therefore, when Peter had suspicions, he could have asked Neal. And before Neal saw his dad, he could have told Peter beforehand which would have solved much of the unnecessary chaos. But, instead we ended up with a don't ask, don't tell situation and all the problems that followed. It may have been a bit predictable but it was entertaining!"
3,hasnt saved any of my fish or eggs,I've used this on my bettas and fish eggs but I'm not sure if it works since I've never actually saved any eggs. Many site and forums say that it does but perhaps when i used it they were too far gone.
3,Gerard Manley Hopkins died in 1889,"Inasmuch as the famed Jesuit and Catholic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins died in Dublin, Ireland, in 1889, he would never have heard of Francois Mauriac, who was born in Bordeaux, France, in 1885. It is unknown whether Hopkins knew any French, but he may have appreciated Le Mystère Frontenac for its settled acceptance of Catholicism, after a long struggle.The translator, Gerard Hopkins, is not known to be related to his famous namesake."
5,Excellent jazz outing,"Craig Pilo's ""Just Play"" is a pleasure to listen to, both as an attentive exercise in modern jazz, and as a simply great jazz album to have on while going about your day. It's a welcome addition to any collection and I definitely recommend it to friends. Any drummer should consider this a worthy study as well."
2,Expensive and Cursory but Readable,"There's not enough material to warrant the price. The book is easy to read, but the author repeats himself far too much. As justus@acm.org notes, the book is full of of filler sentences, paragraphs, and chapters.The title of the book seems incorrect, since the real-time portion of the book is skimpy. Rate-monotonic analysis, synonomous with real-time in academia, is only given a sentence. Ada, ""the"" real-time programming language, is barely mentioned. While Ada's pros and cons can be debated, it is almost completely skipped. On the other hand, software engineering practices, design methodologies, and testing have their own chapters.I didn't hate the book, but felt cheated after paying [the money]."
2,good,"The quality of the book's material and type are very good. There are a great many references to illustrations, maps, pictures, etc. The book I have has no illustrations. If I had known, I would have purchased a book with illustrations."
2,Dusty and smelly book but good info,"I wish the seller had not said ""very good condition"" because it definitely was not. It was dusty with cob-webs and smelly. From what I've read so far, the info is good though."
2,Terrible formatting,"While Wodehouse's Jeeves & Wooster is still a treasure after 75 years, this collection is the sort of slap-dash production we too often get with cheap Kindle deals. The formatting is terrible, with large inexplicable breaks throughout the text, and a font that is very light gray; it's like trying to read smoke. You get what you pay for with this product."
5,Alwyas brightens my day,"I just love the Bertie and Jeeves stories. They are so clever and funny. I love that Jeeves (the butler) is so brilliant and well informed, and dignified, the opposite of ""mentally negligible"" Bertie (his employer). Really, since Jeeves is the butler and Bertie is the genteleman with the expensive schooling, you would expect it to be the opposite, but that is part of what makes it so much fun! And Bertie totally acknowledges the fact that his head is there ""mostly for decoration"" and that Jeeves is brilliant.Bertie does rebel on occasion and have his own ideas that Jeeves finds ""unsuitable""jj, like growing a moustache or wearing a white mess jacket, but he invariable ends up in some sort of scrape that Jeeves gets him out of, so he always gives in.These stories will brighten your day.""Right Ho, Jeeves"" is my favorite. I don't know how many times I have read it, and it still makes me laugh!"
4,A great book,"This was the first actual book i read on witchcraft, the rest that I know, I had already learnt from other sources, chiefly friends. This is a very good book for someone who does not know anything about wicca. However for anyone who has been practicing for more than a year or so it will simply be covering old ground. Excellent coverage is provided on the history of the craft and there is sound infomation on the festivals and on tools of the witch. If you want to buy your first book I recommend it to you, otherwise I would wait for something a little more advanced. All in all a good book."
2,Disappointing,"I do not know whether this was Suttons first book, but it reads like it is. The information would be far more effective arranged quite differently. Even the publisher did not correct either the authors style or his arrangement of the material.Over all, I was disappointed. The style is sloppy, redundant at times and overly general when it needs to be specific. Linkages are may times vague and not born out by actual material, causation is then implied. A lot of the book is more ""guilt by association"" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized.Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history. Unfortunately Sutton is not one of those books. For the price asked for it, I could not recommend him as a valuable source.If a paper back version selling for $6.95 ever comes out, then and only then could I recommend spending any money on it."
2,Not too good,"I bought the book with high expectations since it had many good reviews but I couldn'tget past the first 100 pages or so. The two things that really bothered me were thedefense of the Indian caste system and his, seemingly, racist views towards white people.There is ample evidence that the Indian caste system has been a great tragedy for thelow castes of India and it seemed strange how much he defended it. On this point, I thoughtthat Vivekananda was immensely more enlightened. Then he kept making remarks about ""white""people, almost always in a derogatory manner or at least with a sense of some lingering bitterness.Perhaps, the fact of British colonial rule still weighed heavily on him. Maybe he is agreat saint, maybe not, but that's my opinion on as much as I read (which wasn't too much)."
1,"Definitely NOT a great ""Butterfly""","Because I was a Bjorling fan when younger, this was the ""Butterfly"" I grew up with. Over the years, however, I have come to realize that it is far from a great performance. Santini's conducting is cool and detached, de los Angeles tears her voice to shreds in an attempt to sing ""dramatically,"" and Bjorling really just shouts the role of Pinkerton.Much better is the 1966 recording with Scotto, Bergonzi and Barbirolli, and best of all is the 1954 recording with de los Angeles, di Stefano and Gavazzeni. In fact, this latter is a ""Butterfly"" for the ages, stripping the music of its overdone dramatic traditions and instead focusing on warmth, humor and musical values. Get it instead; don't waste your money on this recording."
2,Something missing in these performances,"Something is missing in these performances. For starters, it doesn't sound like Mozart to me. I never get the sense that the music is expressing human feelings, it doesn't breathe or unfold in any kind of organic or spontaneous sense. I'll keep listening and re-listening, but so far I have to say I've been disappointed with this set."
1,product doesn't work,The cable doesn't work as a sync cable. It needs the hot connect button. Only thing its good for is to charge a usless product.
4,The Railway Children as Good as Ever,"This is a splendid remake of E. Nesbit's classic children's novel, The Railway Children -- it is as good as the earlier (1970) version, and also, in its way, as delightful and moving as the book itself. Jenny Agutter, who was wonderful as Bobbie in the earlier version, is equally splendid as mother in this; while Jemima Rooper makes a perfect Bobbie, struggling on the threshhold of womanhood. The production is in general careful and imaginative. I have one criticism only -- why, oh why, do those responsible for Masterpiece Theater imagine that we are incapable of appreciating such an offering as this without ""commentary"" before and after it? There would be something patronizing about such an assumption, even if the commentary said anything worth saying: as it is, we are inflicted with several minutes of Russell Baker mouthing pompous, irrelevant twaddle. Five stars for the movie, and MINUS five for whomever cooked up that nonsense!"
5,Railway Children,Received movie within 3 days of ordering it. It was in perfect condition. Thanks for the wonderful service.
1,fog lights,Now bright enough. Don't buy it. I am very disappointed. Get the old fashioned kind and don't be incised by the pretty style of these lights.
1,Bogged down in detail,"This book is waaaay to detailed. If you want to know all kinds of facts that really have nothing to do with the battle, like what every politician was thinking, what every correspondent was reporting and all kinds of other side facts, this book is for you. It begins with no real history or set up and concentrates on the embassy in Ho Chi Mihn City like that's the center of it. No way. I enjoy history, but why does almost every historical book I read have to be an epic bogged down by minutia. Give me a really strong overview with only the essential facts, and if I want to know every detail I will pursue further books. I have so many books like this I can't finish, and I'm a patient reader. That's it!"
2,Predicable,"An interesting take on the art of forgiveness, but like the authors earlier works - all to predicable."
2,"A movie, nothing more.","Star Trek Klingon is a short ""made for TV"" movie where you control the outcome. There is nothing more to it.While the game features good direction by Frakes and at times, you do feel a part of the story, you will get bored rather quickly.What keeps the game from being a total bust is the Klingon Language factory, where you get a chance to speak Klingon into the microphone and be graded on the pronunciation. Quite fun!As a Star Trek Fan, this is a collector's item, but I don't find myself playing the game often."
2,Check if it runs,"No manual included. Tip: click on ""dagger"" symbol in middle at bottom of screen to speak. Doesn't look like the game runs on windows 2000."
1,wrong shoes,I WANTED THE BLACK 9WEST PUMPS. AFTER I PLACED THE ORDER AND REALIZED I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHE INSISTED THAT I ORDERED THE BLACK EVEN THOUGH THE COLOR SAID NATURAL. SO I HAD TO GO ON VACATION WITHOUT THE BLACK PUMPS THAT I WANTED.
5,"I can't be positive, but I think he blew my mind.","Reading Descartes is like a breath of fresh air. Frankly I'm surprised no one has reviewed this before now. Reading Descartes is kind of like being informed you were going to die today, but were miraculously saved at the last moment, all without your knowledge. It changes your version of the world in the way only really good poetry can. He is so logical it makes his writings and thought process really clear and concise and this translation seems really user friendly to a layman like myself. I can't be positive, but I think he blew my mind."
4,Essential reading for people who care about the real world.,"This was an incredibly enlightening read. In a time when so many people have become mental couch potatoes and easy, minimialist sound-bites are sold as ""fact"", this book sheds the light on the depth of real world events and affairs and the American role in them--and how it impacts us directly. Once you read this book, you'll never view broadcast and print media ""reporting"" the same way."
5,Simply Amazed,"When I had first heard of this series I wasn't too interested, I had read a couple ""professional"" reviews that had put it down and made it seem like a copy of Lord of the Rings with different names.After going to the bookstore and picking it up to read the first chapter or so I was hooked and bought the first 3 books on the spot.I burned through the books in about 3 days by only reading in my free time because they are so well written that they grab your attention and refuse to let you put them down until you read the last page.After reading all 4 books that are out so far I have this burning desire to read the next book in the series and itch for when Mr. Rudder will finish and release the 5th book."
5,Stainless steel that fits like a glove.,"These stainless steel heat shields fit like a glove in my Thermos BBQ. I am not certain, but I do not believe the original 19 year old heat shields were SS. It is very important to measure your existing heat shields and find exact replacements, which may be difficult since not all seller's note measurements. I used the model numbers found on Lowe's web site (that did not have measurements) to search on Amazon for units (with measurements) that fit my BBQ. Since they all look alike for each mfg., it is impossible to differentiate w/o the exact dimensions. Again, these units are well made, perfectly straight pressings that match the originals exactly. Although, you must allow for some heat shrinkage and distortion when measuring your old units for replacements. I also saved $20.00 over the Lowe's price, not including sales tax and shipping."
1,Poorly Written and Oversimplified,"I purchased this book as a requirement to complete the modules for the CFP exam. This book is too basic for any qualified professional in the financial services industry. Additionally, the book is poorly written and does not organize the concepts you are supposed to understand into a concise and coherent format. A particularly irritating aspect of this book is the questions and answers within each chapter. in addition to the book being poorly written, there are inaccuracies in some of the tax concepts that are presented. I did give the book one star because I believe it will serve to promote the financial planning industry by encouraging readers to seek professional advice from a financial planner in order to straighten out any misunderstandings and confusion the book creates."
3,Recommended by BU,This is a really great book for CFA. Its the text book officially recommended by Boston University. The style of writing is very precise and the contents are very well organized. The material is well presented. I would personally recommend this book as a reading for beginners of CFA courses.
5,A absolute must for anyone with questions on Mormonism.,"This book objectively compares modern evangelical doctrine and the teachings of the LDS Church. By using only the Bible as its base of reference, it looks at the misconceptions that evangelicals have regarding LDS theology. It exposes the ""yellow journalism"" and shock statements that those who attack the Mormons use so often. This book is a must for any Mormon or Evangelical who wants an honest, no-holes barred look at what the Bible says about the Mormons. Such topics include The Nature of God, Baptism for the Dead, Method of Baptism, etc."
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful set. I would like to correct an error below. The climax in the Liebestod is a high A flat not high C. But you have to cut through the dense orchestration. That's why it's hard.
5,Great deal for the money. WDS works with AirPort Express,"I'm very happy with this unit having only taken it out of the box an hour or so ago. I've already managed to configure it with WDS supporting my Apple AirPort Express as a remote base station. YEAH!The Buffalo web interface works just fine... so what if it doesn't look as sexy as the AirPort Admin? It works! And for under $70, it's a no-brainer.good info on configuring the WDS to work with AirPort (Express) found here:http://apx.indusdevelopment.com/"
3,OK but not my favorite!,"These pans lasted a couple years, but I had to buy slide on handle grips to make them easy to use. So the money I thought I was saving went toward the cost of buying the grips. Would not buy them again, unless I could not find the ones I have now from Betty Crocker by METRO. However the slanted sides on these pans were more desirable."
2,What could have been...,"This album could have been something special, however, there are too many cheesy beats and too much background singing. I love every Johnny Cash album I own (I have over 350 Johnny Cash songs), but this one is disappointing. I would even listen to Johnny Cash read a phone book. This album lacks the simplicity and class the other Cash albums have.I would suggest getting: ""The Christmas Spirit"" by Johnny Cash instead."
1,Can Not Get Into It!,"I can not get into all the episodes where the Forest Whitaker character, who as retired marine or something talks about humans being preprogarmed to kill. Yhea, Penelope Garcia is there. I have watched all the Criminal Minds episodes, and Ms. Garcia a very compelling character... I just can not go beyond my belief this series spin-off is not going to foster a few more killings in the world by making some folks the believe they can stifle their animalistic urges."
5,Discipline and these tapes make you a winner!,"The second installment of Blackjack's Hidden Secrets simplifies your gaming approach to five steps. On the surface they are simple, but the secret to your success is STEP 5 - Discipline (to do steps 1 - 4). Couple the expertise in these tapes with hours of practice, and you'll have a winning approach to making money at blackjack!This does not involve card counting, and this play is permitted at casinos. With this program, I have an 82% win rate. But it does take practice!I have given this as a gift to every gambling pal I have. Give it a try."

1,Poor Quality Docs!!!,Worst Doc Marten's EVER!! Size and fit OK. BUT the outside sole Cracked/BROKE after a couple use. VERY Disappointed!!! Emailed the the manufacturer about the problem with the sole but never get back or replied to my complaint!!
4,addictive,"I am very happy with my purchase of this game. It has its issues, such as the horrible cutscenes and obscene learning curve, but once you get the hang of it the game is incredible. The graphics are beautiful, the economy is very deep, and the universe is huge and completely non-linear. If you liked Freelancer but felt it was not open ended enough, this game is for you."
4,Works for Verizon Phones: Blackberry and HTC,Can't beat the price.. and worked perfectly on both my Blackberry and HTC Incredible. Fits tight too.I just wish the block itself was a bit smaller.
1,Not good at all,This was a gift for my 12 year old niece and it did'nt work after 2 days. Poor sound poor quality. Sounds like an old transistor radio. Poor quality looks cheap. Anti skip does not work would not play a cd all the way. Bass is just loud noise no good sound for the CD. I returned item for refund.....
1,(Foreign) Enemy of the State,"Didn't realize this was not an ""english"" item. Should verify that you are purchasing a non-English item. Also purchased book in foreign language didn't know was non-english."
3,"Starts off great, ultimately disappointing","Despite a good cast, a strong premise, and a great start, I was ultimately let down by this movie. It seems like it got ""Hollywooded"" just enough, watered-down a bit too much to be a great thriller. That's a shame, it could've been."
5,Action Packed - Thriller,"I bought this movie in 2007 and have since bought the bluray verion of the movie. Downright murder through dirty politics precedes the infidelity, illegal surveillance, crime, and payback that make up this thrill-packed action movie. This movie can so easily be overlooked (at one's loss and peril) but it pitches up there with some of Will Smith's best movies. If you liked Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey Jr. and Wesley Snipes's US Marshalls (1998) then you will love this movie. A great buy."
4,Very Cool!!! (4.5 stars),"Good flick. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Will Smith and Gene Hackman. Wow!Will Smith is brought into the story as an unsuspecting businessman. By accident.This film just takes off from the very beginning.I am not going to give the story away, but you will not be disappointed if you get this one."
3,It could'a been more...,"I love the cast in this film. Hackman and Smith have done some really excellent work. While I generally enjoyed this film for what it was, it could have been much more. I am somehow reminded of ""Conspiracy Theory"" in that it was a disappointment considering the possibilities it offered. Mostly, the problem is in the basic premise of the story. Any one of thousands of conflicts could have been played out, but instead, we see a personal crime in Voigt's character taken out on an unsuspecting citizen. This may sound minor, but we could have seen a glimpse of some big-brother massacre, and the minor hero who overcomes it. Some of what is offered here makes you wonder (in worried fascination) what is possible, but generally I can say this is NOT a must-see movie. If you saw Conspiracy Theory, don't bother with this one. I give it 3 stars in case you didn't catch Conspiracy Theory, otherwise, 2 stars."
1,Enemy of the State,We just tried to watch this movie and we receive a message Playback Prohibited and it does not play the movie. We spent our money on this and it doesn't work. Doesn't anyone check to make sure the movie will play? We buy many movies and I am very disappointed.
1,Skip it.,A Very long and boring movie to say the least. It is way too confusing and has enough story for 3 movies. It gets too frantic sometimes and the end was all mess and kept me way too confused. Not enough explaining. Good acting though (which is what saves it) but there is way to much empty space in between.
4,A smart action movie.,"The critics weren't fair to this one. It is one of the best looking, best acted, most well written action/suspense films I've ever seen. Yes, it has the obvious car crashes, high speed and on foot chases, shootouts, and explosions, but this movie uses basic intelligence as its main driving force. The other action movie cliches that I just mentioned are used very wisely and sometimes very funny. This is one of the most well thought out action movies I've ever seen, and I highly recomend it."
4,"A Great movie to watch, with lots of action.","Will Smith and Gene Hackman do some great acting in this movie. It's not overly done with a whole bunch of special effects but it will hold your interest and keep you at the edge of your seat. Don't watch this movie expecting it to be the best yet, and you'll enjoy it."
3,"Great acting, but not the best film","Lots of action and superb and believable acting by Will Smith and Gene Hackman. The best part of the film is seeing the technology available by the government to do satelite spying, et al. Having a bunch of 19-yr-olds doing the observing, however was a bit too much of a wishful rip-off of ""Sneakers."" I didn't buy it at all, even though I wanted to.Knowing that there is literally surveillance everywhere nowadays, it is highly unlikely that assassins with the government would have made a hit in such a public, open place in the first place. Some of the premise makes sense, but it goes everywhere. This film tries to be too many things, part ""Sneakers,"" part ""Patriot Games"" and part ""French Connection."" It doesn't work. The movie is well shot and those who are satisfied with pyrotechnics, action and spy gadgets will still enjoy this film. I liked it, but not enough to ever watch it again."
5,A twist out of 1984,"Will Smith is good in this movie,Jack Black, Gene Hackman and lots of spying on Americans, almost like it could have foretold the future.You will like this movie if you dislike the patriot act."
5,One of the best action/thrillers ever made!,"Sit back and get caught up in, I would say yhe best thrillers of the year. Will Smith and Gene Hackman play together for the first time - and I must say that they are doing it very, very good. I can't say more about this movie than - Exellent."
4,Realistic,This is what I like about Will Smith. He can make many situations funny and/or sad at the same time. This high-tech thriller is all about breaking the Bill of Rights. Obstruction of Privacy. Something that can haunt anyone. This turns that haunting into reality. This is undoubtedly one of Will Smith's best performances. Although I'd have to tie it up with MIB or Indepentence Day. Gene Hackman gave a rather admirable performance. This movie shows the high technology that might be surrounding the Earth. With today's pictures and live movies that are available on the Internet makes this movie very believable.
1,I can not play this,"I do not know what "" not in Zone 2 means"" and sending it back costs as much as I paid for it.... Beware of Wolves in Sheeps Clothing..... Would not have purchased if I was previously aware of restrictions on playing this... Major disappointment"
1,a rip off and a disapointment,"This only presents (very) short interviews of the three victims of the duke lacross hate crime hoax and of one prosecutor who declared them innocent. It never gives an extensiv presentation of the events that surrounded the case : If you're not very familliar with this affair, you can hardly understand what went on from watching this DVD. It's like you get only the last page of a book but not the whole story.This is one of these ""read the small prints"" product. The ""sixty minutes"" title is very misleading : in fact, the video last only 20 minutes but you won't know that unless you read very carefully (which I didn't) the product description. For this lenght, it's a very expensiv product and it's not even a well crafted report.Frankly speaking, I ordered it all the way from europe and I feel this product is a complete rip off. Don't buy it."
2,Sadly not very good,"With these great actors, you'd expect a pretty good film. But, sadly, it isn't. The fight scene on the ghost ships of the East Bay is laughable. Ninjas go after the 'good guys' with swords. They get shot to pieces. Who would do that?This is an 'essential' film as determined by Amazon? I'd say not. Besides, Mr. Essential Video has it wrong on where the ghost fleet is. It's in the East Bay, the Carquinez Straits, near Martinez. It's not in the North Bay.A disappointment."
2,If you are trying to teach yourself ....,"then this book is NOT for you. I tried to teach myself Spanish (I didn't know any) and this book just did not work out because of its poor construction. The concepts are not clearly described and all too often I found myself asking why is this grammar like this or what is the difference between the different tenses. The examples are not very helpful either.However, I took a private introductory class and then returned to this book. Here, the book has provided some value with its vocabulary which is grouped by themes (festivals, family, etc). So the book has some value for a beginner if you are also receiving extensive instruction from another source."
3,I think barnabas was a strong and brave man,"Barnabas is kicked out of his hometown, England. he comes to America finds gold and gets married and starts a family. Much of his personality is passed down from his father. He fights w/ several indians adn is friends w/ some."
5,An Excellent Story,"Louis L'Amour has created a fascinating tale of what life was like for an adventure loving, honest, hardworking family with the Sackett's series. His first book of the series is one of the best. It tells the story of Barnabas and his increddible adventure after finding a bag of ancient gold. The story is very entertaining right from the begining and memorable long after you have finished. Regardless though, it is something many people will want to read again and again through our their lives."
3,"Flawed Cover, Great Story","This book arrived on time and in generally OK condition. Unfortunately, it was previously owned by a library, so it had the library's name ink-stamped on the page ends and the books Dewey Decimal number glued and taped onto the spine. Since the cover and binding were simulated leather, removing these essentially ruined the cover. I felt like the rating was inappropriate for such a book.As far as the story itself was concerned, it is one of Louie Lamour's best books. It is the first of the Sackett family series, and a delightful tale. It tells of how Barnabas Sackett came to be one of the first to colonize America, and the challenges of life and travel at that time. The rest of the Sackett series expands on this story line with stories of the sons of Barnabas from the East coast to the frontier West, but that's in other books. But I recommend them all to you! Lamour does great research for his books, and really gets into the historical period of the era."
5,Couldn't put it down!,This series was excellent. I enjoyed reading the series and then shared it with my daughter who is living in Norway.
3,Amazing Book,The best Health Book I have ever read! If only all of America would take the time to read and implement some of the suggestions by Mr. Moritz instead of popping Drugs to cover their health symptoms.
4,Nice Beginning But.......,"There is no reason to berate this early effort of Miss Rimes. She soars on ""Blue"" and the other tunes are mostly above average. She was the heir apparent of Patsy Cline but in later efforts has been more ""pop"" and concerned with dance routines a la Britney. She has had the chance to accept the Patsy mantel while maintaining a modern sound but abdicated for other things. You can always look back to this piece of work though as to what might have been."
4,Huge Talent,"I was so impressed with the title song of this album, having heard it on the radio, I had to purchase the entire disc. The rest of the album is equally impressive in my opinion. To think the huge voice and talent behind these songs was a (at the time) 13-year-old girl was amazing. I can't say too much for the direction she's taken since this debut, but this particular cd is a standout in country music. An awesome work."
1,More Pop Crap,LeAnn Rimes music is NOT country. She has never been country and never will be country. Her music is just crappy generic pop fluff. If you whant REAL country music try listening to Patsy Cline or Hank Williams.
3,Use with Caution,"This book affords many review questions, but has a lot of wrong answers. You will need to be on your toes for this to be beneficial for study material. Seller shipped fast and received in great condition in a timely manner."
2,This movie is too boring,This movie just didn't move me. The characters felt real as well as the storyline. The only problem is that I didn't care what happened and it didn't keep my interest.
1,"My Amazon Instant Video ""experience""","I would love to write a review of my Good Will Hunting ""experience"" but my Amazon Instant Video failed to play the dozen or so times I attempted to watch within my rental period. At exactly 24 seconds into the movie it would shut down and freeze. Very disappointing but not the first time that something like this has happened with an Instant Video rental. So my one star rating is for Amazon Instant Video service and not the movie Good Will Hunting (which is excellent)!"
2,I've always enjoyed Robin Williams ... until this movie,"I had no preconceived ideas about this DVD. All I knew was that Robin Williams was in it, so I expected to be entertained. But it was ages before he turned up and by that time a story that started off promising had become unbearably slow. I also got fed up with nearly every second word of the dialogue being the f word and started to wonder just how brilliant this young man really was when he clearly had a vocabulary every bit as narrow as that of his best friend. I've given the movie two stars simply because of the excellent acting. Maybe it's just me. I loathe books about teenage angst (I find them boring) and there was definitely plenty of angst in this movie. I watched it with my husband, BTW, and he was every bit as bored as I was."
1,Rubbish,"That this piece of trash won any awards at all says a great deal about the awards themselves. From what I have heard this movie was written by a couple of college students. That is not surprising because it seems like it was written by a couple of drunken college students. It was predictable, inane, stupid, boring and just downright awful. The acting was attrocious with the exception of Robin Williams, who put forth one of his most believable performances ever. My favorite bad line was (quoted from memory) ""Do you like apples? Well, I got her number how do you like those apples."" What tripe. What rubbish. If wasting celluloid was a crime then this movie would be criminal. Please, don't waste your time watching this film. Life is too valuable. Spend your time more fruitfully: clip your nails, clean your kitchen, even watch reruns of the Brady Bunch."
1,Good Will not enough talent,"Mr Will Hunting has it all.He's a genius. He has an eidetic memory. He can beat up people. He's a fast talker that can out duel a Harvard student. He's charming. He can woo women. He knows more math than Gauss, Euler, Poincare, Hilbert, and Ramanujan combined.He is the modern day Leonardo Da Vinci for academians and for women's hearts.But, how can we, the average schmoes, take this movie seriously, when Mr Will Hunting cannot bend spoons? C'mon writers! What a glaring omission!Clearly a character this talented deserves to have telekinetic powers!For more entertainment and >>realism<<, I recommend watching old episodes of MacGyver or the Pretender."
2,How to succeed in mathematics without really trying,"This movie is okay to watch the first time around--but too annoying to watch a second time--or to even reflect on it afterwords. Anybody who has even the vaguest understanding of what it means to do original work involving higher mathematics will find this film ridiculous. Yeah, some people are indeed brilliant, but they apply their brilliance to incredibly difficult problems that had frustrated other brilliant minds before them. Einstein had to let all other duties and family responsibilities slide while developing general relativity. Brilliant and ground-breaking theoretical work is hardly possible as a part time hobby. Nor do professors at big name schools like MIT fawn over the work of even their most brilliant graduate students or post-docs--let alone the facile scribbles of self-educated janitors."
2,Rating downgrade upon second viewing,"I'd seen this film years ago when it came out. I remember liking it ok. Now after just rewatching it, I can see many weaknessess. Its an average film, in some ways maybe below average. I liked Robin Williams in this role. The rest was all pretty lame. But people grow, and this was a decent effort."
1,waste of time,"no plot, waste of Robin Williams acting skills, and by the way do people really say that word so much? It became purposeless (if it serves one to start with) as it was overused & abused."
4,Good Will,"Praise was universal on this first writing effort from Damon and Affleck, which is just that, a first time effort. The film starts out very unfocused and does not pull itself together until a third of the way through when Williams arrives on the scene. A more interesting story is between Williams and former roommate Skarsgard. This is a good film, nothing more."
5,Great Movie,I like the way this movie deals with a very serious theme but makes it very entertaining.
3,Not what I was expecting,"I really do like Matt Damon and Robin Williams as actors. I thought this was good, but not overwhelmingly good. The movie did not end the way I thought it would. I was expecting to see Will Hunting go on and get a really good job where he would use his mathematical abilities, become successful and perhaps invent something. But really the movie was about Will Hunting overcoming his personal problems that are holding him back relationship wise, with the help of a counselor/therapist, portrayed by Robin Williams."
4,Language ruined it,"A great story, but the f-word didn't have to be used so often - the overuse of offensive language spoiled the movie for me."
4,Learning to think.,"I thought this film was about learning to think, make decisions. Will was a genius, but could not make personal decisions - he was either a follower or being groomed by the professor. Will could not even decide whether he loved his girl friend; which points out that love is intertwined with our decision making process. In my mind, the psychologist, played by Robin Williams manages to get him thinking for himself."
3,Horrific ending,"Good Will Hunting is both good and original. But where it is good, it is not original and where it is original, it is not good. The depiction of lower class life and the depiction of the lower class kid's and upper class woman's relationship are good. The psycholgical reformation, specifically the end, is awful and shallow. Do not read on if you have not seen the film ""It's not your fault"" if you don't understand how the repittion of those words can lead to a break through, because it wouldn't. Also, Will has an abandonment complex; your telling me he wouldn't feel abandoned after his psychotherapist decides to roam the Earth. As Mr. Maltin stated, the film is fun but does not stand scrutiny."
1,Scratched disc,I was looking forward to watching this movie again but after 15 minutes the movie stopped. When we took it out of the player we noticed the crack in the DVD. I returned it and never received a credit. I was very disappointed about this purchase and lack of refund.
4,Not the greatest (not even close!) but very good.,"I liked this movie because it simply told a good story. We dont' get movies like this anymore in the 90s. I think they were all used up in the 70s. But every now and then, something surprisng comes along and gives us a reason to watch. Along with it's fine performances, GOOD WILL HUNTING delivers something audiences haven't seen in a while: a likeable drama. No action, no sex (not much anyway), and no over acting by overpayed actors. Robin Williams actually deserved the Oscar he recived for this movie. Thumbs up."
5,lol kok ko,"Came as advertised, good price, great film (8.4/10), fine quality and unopened oh my god what a beautiful product thanq"
1,Wake me up when it's over,"I have rarely been so bored at a movie theater. I literally fell asleep for about half an hour, so perhaps I missed something, but I doubt it. Robin Williams overacted. Matt Damen is in love with himself. The movie had no life to it. I'd rather nap at home for free."
2,Was Robin Williams even there?,"This movie doesn't deserve award(s) status. I was channel surfing and joined the movie when Robin Williams was sitting in a restaurant booth with another actor, when I couldn't help but notice the too many back of the head shots during the scene... then it occurred to me... I don't think Robin Williams was even there for the shoot! And, he wins a best suppoting actor award? So, I started big time noticing the number of back of head shots and really bad editing to cover actors' ""awayness"" and clearly, this movie sucks. If you're interested in trying to poduce a movie, you should watch this one if you need a good, ""hell, i can do that"" kind of encouragement. And again, the # of awards? Was there no movies that year or something? This movie sucks."
2,Mirimax shortchanges a great movie,"This is a great movie, worthy of 4 or 5 stars. But the DVD looses 3 stars because Mirimax couldn't be bothered with producing it in anamorphic widescreen.If you have a widescreen high-def TV, wait to buy this one until someone does an anamorphic video DVD transfer the movie deserves.Very dissapointing DVD issue!"
3,"This book has some defects, but isn't useless","I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book is short, has many photos(all of them black & white) and many maps.There's even the photo of Herta Haz(Tito's wife) and the photo of Zarko Broz, the Tito's son and military of Red Army.The introduction of this book wa smade by Sir Fitzroy Maclean, a british who knew Tito during World War II.Defects of this regular book are:1-There's little space about Tito, as a communist dictator.2-The massive murder and expulsion of etnically german, by Tito during 1945 and 1946 has nothing about, on this regular book.3-Being writen during 1960 decade, this book has nothing about Tito late life and the end of his Yugoslavia during 1990 decade.Even so, this book is regular, as an introduction about Tito's life."
3,GB 2525,"Great flick about crowd control for new kind of prisons. It's supposed to take place in the future, but the main story tellers, ride around on huffy stingrays. And the hand hand guns, are kinda lazers but with opened bolts,meaning no ammo, and that's how they fire them. very lame."
1,This sucked,I wouldn't have given this a star. Had no choice. I haven't see a movie this bad since that Statham movie with the Chinese folks and the stolen heart
4,Only great because the others are so bad,"This is the only step up from the poor sound of standard clock radios. Its too bad the jump is about $100. But quite frankly anything less than this is just an alarm clock. I also have a Bose which is also much more expensive and only marginally better for sound quality. So relative to what is out there this is a decent value. I don't agree with the reception claims because my Bose picks up stations better than the BA. I live in a hilly area outside NYC which I know is part of the problem but this is not a miracle receiver. If it was less expensive they wouldn't be able to keep them on the shelves, but at this price........"
1,Terrible radio,"I had my heart all set on purchasing a good radio but alas the talk of this being a good radio was was just BS, the stations would fade in and out and there was a lot of interference from stations that weren't even close in frequency. The volume control knob fell off and now it just sits in my closet gathering dust. Shame on you guys..."
5,Great Product and a Great Value,"This radio is well worth the investment. I was searching for desk top/counter top radio that was small, got good reception and produced superior sound. I was thinking Bose, but then saw that Consumer Reports listed the Boston Acoustics Receptor as similar in quality. At about half the price of a Bose Wave Radio, this product is clearly a great value. I have been very pleased. I also like the clock/alarm features, which are easier to use than those on a typical bedside radio alarm clock."
3,"Cute, but not worth it-","I thought the Tooth Tunes would be such a great idea, it was cut for a one time buy but I won't buy them again. The bristles very quickly become worn and it needs a new head, the problem is that you can not change the head on these. The 2 minute brshing rule is so important but once they figure out how the music starts they can just use it to listen to the music and you've lost the whole purpose behine them. Lastly there is no way to change the battery when it dies. We are going back to a battery operated tooth brush that the heads and batteries can be changed and using a small timer that they can operate."
4,The Grand Finale,"Sophocles finished the trilogy nicely with this. Part 3 basically revolves around the contrast between Creon's hatred and Antigone's compassion. Creon's son also plays an interesting role. He sways between his father and Antigone, and finally he chooses Antigone. The death of Antigone and Creon's son is a worthy followup to the horror of Oediuus blinding himself and the beauty of Oedipus ""seemingly sighted"" entering the Greek version of heaven. It is also interesting that when Creon beholds this horror, he too becomes human again. It is interesting that Sophocles creates both intense horror and beauty in each part of the trilogy. Also, the horror in his plays returns the characters to humanity."
4,Shocking to see a woman place back in greece,"Anigone has shocking surprise, twists, and bumps. As a class we read this book and the tale of Anigone was just terible. I go to an all girls school and I was apauled on how the book killed Anigone and her sister."
3,Rock-A-Billy Rowdy,"If you like the newer Punk/Rebel Rock-A-Billy you'll like this disc.I play a few of the cuts off it on the rock-a-billy review radio show from time to time.The Mean Eyed CatKNON 89.3Dallas, Texas"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course...unfortunately, the instructor never even flipped through it. It is by far the WORST photography book, really the worst book I have ever purchased! There are typo's, the ""example photos"" and instruction sometime are not the same. The projects are lame and really teach nothing. I would not recommend this book under any circumstances...AVOID AT ALL COST!!! [...]"
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME","This book really is an insult. It's ""lesson"" and ""assignments"" are HORRIBLE. They ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book. In a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on. Check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read."
2,Don't waste your money,There are a host of better written & more useful reference books out there. Was a required purchase for a studio class - money down the drain.
5,Grandkids love this toy,My 4 grandkids ages 3-5 love this toy so much I had to buy 4 sets so they would stop fighting for the same parts. They love to use their imagination. One made a video camera out of the pieces and interviewed all of us. Great fun!
1,Elmo goofed,"I used to think Sesame Street is always very educational but no longer think so after sitting through this video (painfully, I might add). To put it mildly, it has no real content and not much worth to remember. Worse yet, it seems awefully long for a Sesame Street tape. The usually curious and lovable little furry red guy spends the entire time goofying around. Watching that stupid Mr. Noodle is most dreadful, boring and a total waste of time. I failed to see anything educational in this film. On the contrary, it sends the message to its young audience that having fun and being funny mean being brainless, silly and stupid. Even though it is supposed to be for 2-5 year olds, they are intelligent enough to know the difference between wit and stupidity, sensibility and absurdity."
1,Pedantic and Unendurable...,"...just like a typical Tim McCarver broadcast. Never one to not let his endless explanation get in the way of your enjoyment of the game, this one picks up where his others leave off. Don't get me wrong -- McCarver's knowledge of baseball is obviously exhaustive -- but his titanic ego comes roaring through here in spectacularly dull fashion. Folks, this is the guy who hinted in the also horrible ""Oh Baby, I Love It"" that he helped mold Bob Gibson into a HOF pitcher (Gibson, as the story goes, once told McCarver during an unwelcome trip to the mound that the only thing McCarver knew about pitching was that he couldn't hit it). If you buy that, then you might as well buy this, too.For a much better book on the same subject, try Keith Hernandez's ""Pure Baseball""."
3,Death By Baseball,"Lots of baseball fans think they know everything there is to know about the game. Not me. While I've been a fan for 30 years, the game's intricate strategies and nuances sometimes go unnoticed until an astute announcer clues me in. McCarver does a great job of explaining everything there is to know about the strategies and the subtleties alike. However, if you are a casual fan, this book may drive you insane. Sometimes we don't need to know everything. The material here is nice to know, not need to know. Make sure you really want to know every aspect of the game before you pick up a copy."
5,"Love this gel, prevents and treats ingrown hair after hair removal","I purchased this for me and my daughter. We have used this after epilation and there are no ingrown hairs that can sometimes be associated with this type of hair removal. Have been using this product for over a year now and love, love, love it! The investment of a good epilator and this gel, saves hundreds a year we used to spend on waxing, with the same smooth results."
1,Didn't work for me as other said,It may work for some people but I spent a lot on this small bottle and it doesn't work for me.
3,Princereigns,This product was okay. Didn't notice much difference when hubby used this. His skin responds much better to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane and Shaved Ice.
3,"Not working for me, maybe for someone else?","This product didn't work for me. Maybe it works better for other people. But, it did leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth."
1,Waste o' money!!!,Bought this stuff to try to help with ingrown hairs and it made them worse for me!!! i ended up with huge lumps and bumps. will never buy again!!! what a waste of money!!!
3,"Works, but no extreme results","This does work, but you gotta be really consistant. I apply this after i use the epilator, and it does sooth the skin.. my primary purpose of buying this was to get rid of my ingrowns, it soothes the ingrown spots when its hurting, but I haven't experienced anything the good reviews told me. I still get a lot of ingrowns, and it gets a little sticky right after you apply it, gotta wait a little before putting on clothes."
1,Not good at all.,I've suffered from ingrown hairs on my legs because I used to use epilator I was really hopeful that this can help me to get rid of them it did nothing for me and also my husband used this and it didn't work for him either. I would never buy it again.
2,Product Advertising Does Not Have Full Disclosure,"I wish I had scanned all of the reviews prior to purchasing and seen the one where the ingredients are listed. Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag but I took a chance because the price compared favorably to my usual choice, the ingrown hair serum sold by European Wax Center which actually comes in a nearly identical bottle. However, this product unfortunately contains parabens, and it seems disingenuous to advertise it as ""natural."" While there is still question around just how dangerous parabens are, there are enough other endocrine disrupters I'm potentially exposed to every day that I don't need to voluntarily add another one, especially when I have alternatives readily available."
3,Takes a lot of practice!,I first saw this product at the Del Mar fair in a booth. The hairstylist tried it on my hair and it looked so easy to work. It left my hair shinny and the curl is amazing. BUT there is a big drawback...Since it does not have a clip to hold the hair in place you have to use your hand and even though it comes with a glove it's so hard to use. I use it on my daughter and I could work it better but I still can't do my own hair. I am sending it back :(
1,Worthless product,The curling iron did not get hot. You could touch it without the Kevlar glove and not get burned. It took just as long as a regular iron to heat up and curl the hair but the curl was not very tight and fell right out. The instruction booklet said the cord was 8 feet long but it was barely 6 feet. I called to report the problem and was sent a second iron. It was just the same as the first one. The company sent me a mailing label to return both irons for a refund.
1,Robin Hood and his mary men,"I love this movie, I sleep with this movie. When I dream at night I dream of this movie, I want to make love to this movie. This movie is my life and soul.And if your feeling a bit hungry come down to Billy Bob's Pizza for the best pizza in the west, if the pizza doesn't satisfy you we will :)"
5,Robin and the Seven Hoods,"The real rat pack is out to have fun again . Grate actors without all the sex and violence of today's movies, but with all the fun and suspense of a good comedy thriller. We have some of the best actors of there day that would still draw a crowd today. Frank Sinatra,Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, Peter Falk all team together to bring fun to the screen for the last time as the RAT PACK. A must see for all old time movie fans."
4,Not black and white.,"It's reflective silver and white, but it still has a similar tonality and clashes with the same colors which it would have, so it's fine.It arrived punctually and I'm happy with it. Also, it will not stretch out your belt loopholes the way some other buckles will because its peg has a curve instead of a ball tip. Thumbs up."
5,"Rapturing ""Serenade""....","I'm reminded of what classical music making is really all about every time I listen to the 'Serenade'. Take an exquisite passage from one of history's greatest English writers (Shakespeare), act V scene I from the Merchant of Venice, add the superb engineering talent of Christopher Parker, and what one gets is a world class but intimate recording of outstanding English musicians.Vaughn Williams wrote some of the most endearing English music and the 'Serenade' is the high point of this disc. The 16 soloists perform admirably and their accompaniment from Boult and the London Philharmonic is excellent. The other works presented on this disc are performed with just as much detail and passion.A great disc, a great recording!"
3,sorry to have to rate low,"Im almost sorry to give this book a rating of three. It is dazzling and unique and very creative. I am glad i read it. The only fault i have with it is the plot. It really runs an irregular length with no real ending. The ending is an illusion, like borchard had to meet a deadline. She made up for the missing plot with fillings of detail and fasinations of all kinds. There also will be other books im sure to make up for what this one was missing. It is still an interesting read and Im glad to have had the expirience. This book is not for shallow people and in parts can be distastful to a more sheltered reader. Keep in mind that not all books paint pretty pictures, and if that is all you are looking for in life you will be very disapointed."
1,The most boring book that I have ever read,"In my search for interesting werewolf books, I came across The Silver Wolf. I tried very hard to continue reading this book, but it became arduous and seemed more like a task than something that I was doing for enjoyment. The lead character of Regeane was so boring and weak in human form that it became impossible to believe that she was a werewolf. I'm sure it was written that way on purpose. This is the first werewolf book I read that NEVER described the form change. It was written as if it just happened, like changing clothes. I had to throw it away about half way through to move onto something else that didn't put me to sleep."
4,nice enjoyable red,"not my usual cup of tea but I really enjoyed this book. I too wish there were more about Maniel and Regeanne . The characters were wonderful and unlike one of the reviews,I am glad there was less of Silve.Recommended this book to anyone who wants to take a chance and read something very different"
5,Some people don't think it's that great -- I do!,"I really LOVED this book! It's worth buying it in hardback if you can. I guess it really depends on the kind of person you are when it comes to deciding whether you like it or not. Alice Borchardt combines some of my favorite subjects: the ancient world and fantasy. Not only that, but the characters are great and they really got to me from the start (except for ths villains, of course). At least some people should think about all that action in it -- there was not one boring moment in it for me, and close to the end, your heart starts pounding like crazy. I found myself shrieking at any people who interrupted me during the time I was reading this book. I liked it so much that I read it again. I read pretty fast, and I skip parts all the time. : ) I hope Ms. Borchardt plans to write another book (possibly a sequel or prequel that can happen in another time period?) because if she did, I wouldn't hesitate to by it in hardback...again."
2,It does not run in the family.,"I picked up the book because I read Anne Rice's books. Hit of miss, I pick her titles up in hard cover, as more often than not, they are enjoyable reads. When I found out her sister wrote a series of books, I thought I would give them a try. I did not expect them to be the same, I was just hoping for a good told tale.I was able to get 104 pages into the paperback version of this title before I gave up. I could not care about ""our heroine."" I kept hoping I would get some sense of a plot. I never did. I never got the direction the book was going in. It read to me as if the writer had an idea, but was allowed to go with a first draft.I don't usually give up on a book, but there were too many switchbacks in those 100 pages and I simply stopped caring about Regeane. It lacked ""something"" a story needs to hold a reader - that piece of a story, or mystery in a plot that makes you keep reading. I just felt like I was reading on a journey to nowhere."
5,VERY Satisfying - a MUST for any Badfinger fan,"What a fantastic collection of songs! Anybody who gives this CD a bad review has to be the biggest ignoramous that ever lived. The sound might not be perfect,(being home demos, and who knows what kind of shape the tapes were in?)However, the great music and the performances shine through nevertheless. (I recommend 7 Park Avenue over the more recent and far less consistent Pete Ham CD, ""Golders Green""). I think about Pete Ham a lot and all that he had going for him, I mean, so much songwriting talent, a girlfriend who loved him, and why he would want to take his life. I hear all the stories, but, well at least we have this superb collection of his songs to cherish, a compilation that Pete would undoudtedly be proud to have released."
5,Reliance Am/Watt Tester Works as Advertised,"Clear, bright display, Amps or Watts. Surprised to discover appliance data plates are rarely accurate. CFL (compact flourescent light-""curly"") bulbs are the biggest offenders, with most of them consuming 3-4 times their rated wattage. Essential affordable piece of equipment for generator loads, or just finding out how much electricity you're really using. Very pleased!"
3,Interesting,"An interesting read; detailed, descriptive & understandable. I was able to use some techniques described to advantage."
5,Meisner is one a kind.,"This book is a very good introduction to Meisner's work. As one of the other reviewers said it would be best to do this while studying in a class setting (can you imagine doing the word repition game by yourself?). The thing that's always impressed me about Meisner's work is that you won't find anything like it anywhere else. Strasberg was influenced by mainly by Stanislavsky's early work and Adler was influenced by his later work. Meisner took influences from everywhere (Michael Chekhov, Duse, etc.) and synthesized them into something all his own. This is one, I believe,of only four books on his approach to acting so this is as close to the source as you're going to get!(Meisner passed away in 1996). Buy the book!"
4,Great for scar care,"I have been using Miracle Oil to soften a surgical scar. With regular use, it softens the skin and helps to ease the stretching pain."
3,This scent is alright.,I normally use Sung by Alfred Sung and love it. So I decided to try one of his other scents. But I have to say that while it is nice it is not anywhere near the scent of Sung. I always get compliments when I wear Sung but with this it was no compliments just you smell nice.
5,Look and feel great!,"Bought to upgrade my VTX 1800 stock grips, these really compliment the chrome look on the bike and feel much better on the longer rides. The rubber is raised up slightly so it provides airflow under the gloves and takes a lot of the vibration out. Installation wasnt bad at all, I did the wd-40 and a screw driver method to loosen up the old grips and the came right off, cleaned up the left over glue and slid these on with the included glue and they are solid as a rock."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"This is quite possibly the absolute WORST LOA album I've ever heard. Try Voodoo-U instead, much much better."
3,"Good....but it can't compare to ""Lust"" or ""Voodoo-U""","I had purchased the single for ""Am I Sexy?"" and was very disappointed. Therefore, I was quite hesitant about buying the whole album. There are some good remixes, but they can't compare to the original tracks. This is for the faithful LoA fans only."
5,One of my Favorites,This was first showed to me in my school in North Carolina. I suppose the pupose was to show us what the cultures were like in the mountains of NC.. the blue ridge. I have always remembered it as being a very good family film with quality acting. I have been looking for it and finally found it here. Kurt is great in anything... you can really tell that he acts for the enjoyment of it and that carries over in everything he does. Wonderful supporting cast and Phenomenal work by McGillis. Very very good
3,Overrated book,I admit the book serves the purpose but the information can be obtained by the specifications and the examples are not as good as those found in other similar title book
1,Stick With Sandpaper,"I bought this product hoping to use it to strip down the paint on a 1950's kiddie school desk. The desk only had two coats of paint, the original beige (no primer) and a quick spray of black by somebody else who own the desk at some point.I poured the stripper over a section of the metal desk and let it stand 15 minutes and nothing happened. After 30 minutes about 10 percent of the paint covered by the stripper rubbed off with a plastic scrapper, but it wasn't down to bare metal. It barely removed the light coating of black spray paint. There was no curling up or bubbling of paint disolving.For my purpose the stripper didn't perform what it was advertised to do. It was very disappointing.I got better results wet ssanding the desk with 180 grit sand paper."
1,disgusted,"I ordered 2 bottles of lavender honey on line, and have never received the product. what is amazon going to do about this. i have emailed the supplier and have received no response. i want my money back. please arrange to have my credit card credited with the appropriate amountfrances maisfkmais@gmail"
5,Perfect,"This is one of my favorite possesions, it is so much more in person then it is in the picture you see online. As a gift for yourself, or someone you love and adore - that loves things asian - culture, history, literature, spiritual........whatever it maybe, you can not go wrong with this. My wife bought me this for my b-day and she is even proud of herself - it stands out that much - thank you"
5,one of the best sjngles ever.,the metamorphosis megamix on this cd rocks.what am i saying all the songs on this single rocks also .this is a must buy if your into cd singles.take my word friend.rock on.
3,New world symphony,Karan & the Berlin Phillharmonic's 1957 EMI recording of Dvorak's New world symphony is a far better recording than the 1976 recording featured on this CD.EMI released the 1957 version in 2008 on their multi CD box collection cellebratingthe 100th anniversary of Karjan's death.Well worth a listen.
5,love it,"On a visit to Brazil I asked someone to list for me some 3-5 albums of recent Brazilian music. He listed Funk Como Le Gusta as number 5 and said that I might not like it because it is not a typical brazilian music.I had no idea what to expect for. By the time I got to track 3 I knew I am going to play the CD from the begining as soon as it will end. Almost a year later, whenever I want to impress my friends (or just every 2-3 days) I load the CD and it never fails... My fantasy now is to hear them live!"
5,AP Strategy,Nancy Dean's book is a welcome addition for those of us who teach AP English Language and want to provide a valuable resource and strategies for passing the AP Exam.
1,Don't buy this book!,"Given the accolades this book received from other reviewers, I assumed it would contain some truth and a modicum of psuedo-spiritual fantasy. I was wrong. It is an intelligently-contrived heresy. It is counterfeit truth. If I were to write a fabricated treatise on the nature of reality and mankind's place in the universe, I would borrow heavily from the Bible, but twist the text, while building upon well-established New Age lies and so-called esoteric knowledge. This book does that in spades. It's amazing to me that so many people can embrace this trash with such conviction. The Bible says that in the days before Christ's return, mankind will be sent a great delusion, and that people will replace the truth with the doctrines of demons. It seems to me that this process is well underway."
1,New Age False Christ,"When I read this book back in the Middle Seventies I was taken in by this New Age False Christ. His original organization was in southern Illinois, called the Stelle Group. Apparently he is no longer associated with the Stelle Group.He claims association with the Ascended Masters and White Brotherhood both Satanic in origin.I heard him personnaly speak in 1975 when he made false prophecies about coming world catastrophic events in 1977 - obviously they didn't happen.His group and others like it are New Age deceivers taking advantage of the gullibility of those seeking spiritual enlightenment and not knowing where to look."
1,cold emesis,"I read the first edition in 1968.My friends moved to the failed Stelle community.The book helped me to start investigating.The Ultimate Frontier has about as much credibilty as the T.Lobsang Rampa books.If you want to persue an investigative path, read what Zecharia Sitchin has published."
1,Possibly one of the worst movies ever,"If I could give this movie negative stars I would. At first it just seemed like a college film project gone wrong, but it quickly degenerated into something a middle school student would be embarrassed to have made."
3,good extra motivational boost for decluttering,"I recommend ""For Packrats Only"" as a prerequisite for this one. This is like having extra add-ons. He says, you asked for more about...(so what most people have extra clutter problems with, he gives more on. I liked the paper stuff and gifts. I have problems in those areas the most. Most is from your fellow Don Aslett dejunkers. This is extra motivation, but if you can't get both, get the other first. It is funny, as is the other."
3,Frivolous but Compelling,"First, let's be blunt. Aslett got a free book out of the letters and emails sent to him by fans of Clutter's Last Stand. This book has very little Aslett and very little practical advice other than ""toss it."" It consists of personal stories of being a prisoner of clutter, the wilder the better.That said, if you want to feel massively superior to people who've saved sixteen years' of National Geographics, the entire contents of the city dump, or a barn full of fluorescent light fixtures, this book is a hoot. Once you've started decluttering, read this book during your drink breaks. It's easy to put down, thanks to all the short sections, and the vision of not being like these people will keep you going."
2,Liked his earlier books better,"I have enjoyed Don Aslett's books through the years, as have - to my delight - my children, who found him entertaining. This book, however, is a collection of hints from his devotees and just doesn't do it for me like the previous volumes. I might recommend looking through this one before buying - maybe the hints will strike you differently."
2,toast,"we need a toaster-oven that actually toasts, this one isn't very good. There is no toast button, only the timer which is used for the oven. It is hard to get the timing right and it takes forever to toast because the elements are so far away. The oven feature is fine."
2,Not Enough Lady Bird,"I felt that the authors writing style was about that of a middle school student. Unfortunately, there are few books on the life of Lady Bird, and I did learn quite a bit about her life. I was disappointed that once LBJ's presidency was over, the book ended in a few short chapters. The author flew through the last 30+ years! I find it hard to believe that Lady Birds life didn't include much that could have been included in the book. Also, one of the women I admire most in American history is Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas, who was a close friend of LBJ's. There is a photograph of Ms. Jordan with Lady Bird included in this book and the author did not even mention her in the caption that accompanies it. Tacky!!"
3,Author's sloppiness detracts from book's potential,"After all the hype (at least in Texas) about ""Lady Bird,"" and my own fascination with the Johnsons, I was really looking forward to this book. I must say it has not lived up to my expectations. Very little of Mrs. Johnson's gracious voice comes through, so a reader unfamiliar with her would not understand how eloquent she is. Many of the anecdotes seem lifted directly from Caro's and others' LBJ biographies. Finally, how did this book get onto the market with such sloppy editing? The author has Mrs. Johnson's mother pregnant at age 50 when she was actually several years younger according to the birth date and other dates the author provides; and alludes to the Johnsons' wedding and honeymoon in 1954, not 1934. There are numerous annoying typos and not a few awkward grammatical constructions. This book needed more of Mrs. Johnson, less previously plowed ground, and an attentive editor."
2,No strong storyline / plot .....,"Novel spends 12 months in the life of fifteen-year-old Josh Jones. I was disappointed that novel had no well developed storyline / plot. However, I enjoyed the characterization of Old Sam, the town drunk, and how Josh's Uncle Nat (town pastor) was persistent in seeing that Old Sam was taken care of. I also thought Josh's great-grandfather (aka Gramps) did a marvelous job of helping Josh analyze the Darwin theory of evolution in Chapter 17."
2,Ho-hum,"This game is only so-so. It assumes that the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 led to a nuclear war and WW3. But really those incidents have nothing to do with the progress of the game. It could easily have been a game called WW3 and set in the 1960s for all that the CMC had to do with it.Game play is slow and the weapons are limited. Battles can be fought on autocombat or ""by hand."" It's more fun by hand, but gets a bit stale after a bit.Strategy First publishes other great software like ""Dangerous Waters."" If you want a good battle sim, go elsewhere."
1,"BOORISH, FORMULAIC MISHMASH","This will rank right up there in my list of aimless films with a forced and pedestrian plot, that are made simply to rake in some more juice from a Part 2 of a moderately successful Part 1. The gags are so uncomical, the execution so muddled, and the editing so sloppy that Matthew Perry's character gets it right-on when he starts exclaiming about how confused he is by how everything turns out. The audience can surely feel his pain. What a lazy and irrelevant sequel to Nine Yards, which was at least bearable for what it was."
1,What a shame....!,"This movies is not bad. It's worse than that, it is.... useless. Yes, I asted 98 minutes of my life watching it (otherwise I would not review it!), but I advise you to not do so. It's really weak, the onnly average performance is by Willis, who seems to be having fun. The rest of the cast is lost inside a screenplay that has abolutely nothing to offer."
1,Better than watching paint dry... barely.,"The first movie (...Nine Yards) was entertaining. This one is - or should be - an embarrassment to everyone involved in its production. They should have called it ""One More Yard"", since it is about 1/10 as good as the first one. When the actors are interviewed in the future, this should be the answer to the question ""What is the worst movie you ever made?"". With all due respect, I have to believe that anyone who writes a positive review of this movie is either not sober, or stands to make money from it in some way."
4,great movie,"this was a great movie, however i think it's high time that Warner brought out DVDs in cases comparable to other distributors. i think the cardboard case is absolutely terrible. Movie was great, features were good, packaging was cheap and very nasty. get with the program Warner, we consumers want total quality with our products and packaging, not rubbish that looks like the back of a cerial packet."
1,play food,These are just wooden boxes of food - there isn't really anything to do withthen and they are boring. I bought it with the cutting food which is a greattoy and the wooden kitchen which is nice - my 3yo also has a shopping cartand the play food that comes with that which is nice. I wouldn't have boughtit if I could see it first.
3,Pros & Cons about this toy,"I am a huge fan of the Melissa & Doug food items.. own almost all of them. I do not own this one, but my friend does.. and I wanted to give my review on it.Pros:Very durable. These toys will go through everything.. paint stays on well, and can withstand abuse. Obviously, teeth marks.. stepping on them.. throwing them, etc. are no problem for these foods - they will not break.Cons:Heavy. Watch your little one's toes with these items..Not realistic. They are blocks (literally). They are wooden blocks that are painted with ""cereal"" ""rice"" etc. Not even the pictures are realistic.. and toddlers can not read these! They get a 1 star for how unrealistic they are..Bottom line.. yes, they are very good quality, and durable.. but in my opinion, they are more like wooden blocks than food (actually.. they are wooden blocks.. just painted to ""look like"" food.. which they dont). So I am disappointed with this particular wooden set by Melissa & Doug for the realistic aspect of the toy."
4,It's Dirty and It's Hip,"I love this Video Guide to Hip Hop. I used it as a guide to new movement in dance to add to my repertoire. I dance popular Cuban Salsa and I'm always looking for new movements for my freestyle intervals. Reggae-ton and Hip-Hop are fast becoming part of the mainstream in Cuban salsa, and generally, in our culture and dance. The step-by-step breakdown made it easy for me to adapt to these new movements and make them my own. I will still refer back to this dirty little guide from time to time in order to better incorporate more of the movements. That's the best part. It is a great reference and the way they teach it is immediately accessible. I don't usually take the time to write anything in the form of review, but in this case Phil Turay, and Syndee Winters, really hit the mark for me.Thanks guys!SincerelyRico Suave"
2,Not Useful on the Kindle,"This is a truly great book -- but the Kindle edition is not properly formatted for the Kindle. There is no table of contents or links to individual poems. The line breaks in many poems are in the wrong location. Some of the greatest of his poems do not even have line breaks at all but are formatted as a single paragraph. Too bad, but I recommend looking for a better edition of this book."
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes for this book. But I got bogged down in the poor writing and sticky sentimentality and self-indulgence of the characters. Who does this kid think she is that she is so special that she should go to Harvard, on early admission, from out of nowhere? What is this strange relationship with the angel of her eye and ultimate perfection, Laura? Why can't a character that wants to go to Harvard actually speak the English language? And for that matter, why can't the author use the English language and communicate with the poor, beleaguered readers? It should not be so difficult to read a paragraph and sort out the narrative from the dialogue and who is talking to who. Don't waste your time on this book!"
2,Skip it.,"The Life All Around Me by Ellen Foster is less satisfying, unfortunately, than Ellen Foster. This novel revisits Ellen several years later, after she has grown up a bit, become more educated, and enjoyed the love of a strong parent figure. This novel tends to drag, and I had to force myself to keep reading a few times. Ellen's external problems are a little too neatly solved here, though she clearly will have residual phsychological issues regarding her family for the rest of her life. Looking back, I wouldn't have missed much should I have skipped this read."
2,A plodding mess,"Having read and enjoyed 'Ellen Foster"", I never really got around to this sequel until recently when I found it in a dollar store [that itself should have been a hint]. This is a plodding read and is set a couple of years after the last book. Ellen has grown up but her life is less interesting than in the previous book. It just seemed like a half-hearted attempt at addressing what happens to Ellen as she gets older. This is an inferior work of fiction and I would pass on it. There are too many other good books around to waste one's time on drivel."
1,Don't buy it.,"What was the author thinking?!? This book doesn't begin to make any sense at all. Don't buy it. In fact, don't even check it out from the library. Time is too precious to waste reading this."
4,Worth the cost,"This doesn't get a 5-stars because there is not nearly enough putty material in here for these to all be placed up. The type of sticking material they send requires well over what they recommend as if you used the minimum, the stars would become falling stars all the time. For the cost though compared to the amount you get, I found this product to be worth the purchase. I ended up cutting small pieces of the 3M double sided foam tape stuff which was a great decision. The real beauty in this buy is the background it creates to larger stars and constellations. I also bought a set of slightly larger stars to make up some star systems and the pairing of the little stars dotted everywhere really fill in the gaps and make the ceiling feel that much more amazing to gaze at."
4,Starry Night,Great for the price. They glow fairly well after charging for a few minutes. Stars come in two sizes. Largest is about the size of a nickle. The smallest is a little smaller than a dime. I think these sizes are good enough to get as realistic star night ceiling as you can get using plastic stars. Set comes with a little putty to stick up stars. I needed more than came with the pack. Hence why I gave it 4 stars. Overall I think this is a good purchase if you are looking to create a nice simple starry ceiling.
5,Essential for the chansom junkie. Buy It.,"'Poulenc Melodies' performed by a really impressive lineup of vocal talent including Elly Ameling and Nicolai Gedda is exactly the kind of recording you need if you are compulsive about having 'complete' collections of things. This shows a range of composition which smaller releases such as single CD 'Voyage a Paris' (Hyperion, with Felicity Lott and Graham Johnson)can give us. For starters, many of these chansom showed a lot more evidence of more modern stylings and a far greater range of interpretation. In fact, I even had to check the lyrics in the included booklet to verify that on some songs, the performers were singing in French. Even though I have a smattering of knowledge of French, I would have sworn that the singers were performing songs in Russian.I am happy that all four discs run for more than 60 minutes. No cheap short changing here. If you don't want to spring for the large set, the Hyperion release is great, but this is worth every penny."
5,awesome buy,I bought this for my granddaughter for christmas this year and she was thrilled (her words). My daughter was also very pleased as she watched it with her. Very age appropriate and a good choice. My granddaughter will probably watch it several more times.
3,"Glows well in the dark, my kids love it, but needed to be charged with light ahead of time.",glows well in the dark. Needed to turn the bedroom light on for a few hrs so it could charge ahead of time. My kids love it.
5,Blues guitar,Happy Traum is a good teacher. I have several teaching books and CD's and find this book and Happy easy to understand. I highly recommend it.
3,"If the captain scuttles the ship, then take him to court.","I owned this recording on LP for many years. (D'you remember the LP?)While the playing and singing are for the most part extremely good, it's the tempi in ""Pinafore"" that really bogs things down. Of all the G&S scores, this is the freshest and saltiest, and should lift you off your seat, instead of keeping you couch-bound. ""Trial by Jury"" is a different matter entirely, a true joy, recorded as though it were a live performance, complete with chorus mutterings and madcap mayhem: you can almost see the staging. Why doesn't the rest of the series have this kind of life? ""Trial"" was the reason I saved this recording for so long, and the real reason to buy it, if you must. If not, stick to the old D'Oyly Carte. That one showed me how ""Pinafore"" is supposed to go."
4,wow,I read the rest of the reviews and figured i would try it. It looks just as good as the expensive ones for a cheaper price.
4,"paid 1 penny, actually received a cable","paid a whopping 1 penny for this cable, wasn't sure if it was a scam or what, but I actually received a 10-ft HDMI cable in the mail in good order, so bully for whoever this company is.is it a really *great* cable? of course not... I guess -- it's a lot thinner than my other hdmi cables (the ones that cost $20 or $30) but you know what? it works, and I paid $0.01 plus shipping."
4,Good,"Seller provided super fast shipping. The product arrived before I even expected. Output has been great. Construction has been slightly less than what was expected but not to the extent that I'm dissatisfied. Overall, I would still say that this is a 9 out of 10 based on price, shipping and product."
4,You can't beat it.,You can pay $40 at Best Buy or Walmart and this $3 cord will give you the exact same output.
3,Not a fan,I watched the first couple of episodes and finally gave up. I found it heading in a direction I did not enjoy or appreciate. Too much!
2,"disliked it, wouldnt stick",the puddy i received with the product was dried out and wouldnt stick at all. Also i received my package and the star kit box was open
1,Waste of money - don't buy this!,"It says this kit has 150 stars but some of them are so tiny, they are hard to stick in the ceiling. And the from those small ones is not visible at all. Ditch this kit & get one which has fewer but bigger stars."
5,great purchase,The shipping was on time and received in time for Christmas. We put the stars up right away on textured ceilings and they seem to stick fine. They also glow great! My 3 1/2 year old son loves them.
5,Started putting them up Immediately,"I got these for both of my boys, who love stars and the night sky. They didnt waste any time getting them out of the box and on the walls in their rooms. They are very bright and really light up their rooms! They love it. It came quickly and in original packaging."
5,Nancy Dew is awesome,Carolyn Keene has managed to do it again. I read another one of her stories in a day. I love the character of Nancy because she is smart and quick. She uses her mind to solve mysteries. Her kind of character should me in more stories for young girls! This story was filled with a fantastic and intriguing mystery that kept my nose in the book for hours on end.
2,60 Seconds of Life,"We picked this up for my nephew thinking it would be a cool, inexpensive item for him - easily replaced if lost or stolen. Unfortunately, it didn't last long enough to test that theory. He received it on their trip to our home for a visit ... shortly after he was back home in California, it was already having problems skipping cds, etc. I would recommend a better quality CD player, but we haven't attempted to purchase another for him yet. I will be thoroughly checking reviews on players available from Amazon. It's infinitely better getting the opinions of others before investing your dollars in a little known product."
1,Trailer???,"This is the case with too many movies on Amazon. I usually have to go to Youtube to watch the actual trailer. All of those movies DO have trailers, how come it's so hard for Amazon to actually show them? They lost a lot of business because of this. Especially if it's a movie no one has heard of. It might be good, but how can I know when I watch three minutes of nothing but credits??"
1,Why?,"Why in god's name would anyone remake Ordinary World??? The original was (scratch that, IS) beautiful, thus it should have been left alone. Please DJs/Remix artists of the world, turn your attention to lesser music, not classics like this."
4,My son loves this game,My son is three and he can play this game by himself once I get it started he loves it. I really like that he is learning and having fun at the same time.
3,Satisfactory Educational Tool.,"Though initially this software had my toddler's interest, soon he grew less impressed and less driven to complete the challenges that this software offered. Just a satisfactory educational distraction."
3,Good - in parts...,"Dave Holland and Jack De Johnette. Those two names made me pick up this 1994 album by a sax player I hadn't at the time heard of. There's a lot to like on this album but it never reaches the exciting heights one wishes for. That cracking rhythm section pulses away with precision and dynamism but Mr. Denson's own playing is too restrained, too polite in such company. He can play, no doubt about that, but there is no originality and no spark. It's all a bit too much by-numbers. Good, competent jazz but nothing that will knock you down and make you want to hear it over and over. Every time I listen to it it makes me pull out my Dale Barlow albums and give them a spin instead, particularly 'Horn' with Mike Nock (piano) and the great Lloyd Swanton (bass). The two have a similar style but Barlow has an edge and fire to his playing that Denson lacks. Now Barlow with Jack De Johnette - that's something to dream about!"
1,Anti- Italian racist crap,"This book is anti-Italian racist garbage. Completely dated and debunked. Better to use as kindling than reading material. If you want some real insight into the lives and culture of Southern Italians, read ""Were you always an Italian"" by Maria Laurino. Far more accurate and enjoyable than this elitist tripe."
1,Don Juan wearing jaguar skins,"As genuine Guatemalan scholars have written, ""a self-puffing volume without any scholarly basis whatsoever"". With more blatant commercialization but far less scholarship, Prechtel adopts the fantasy writing style of Carlos Castenada to take cultural banditry to new levels."
2,Loved this story,Very inspiring and lovely to read at this holiday season.the message is one that should be remembered and practiced all year around.
4,good read,"Even though this was short and easy to read, it has a great message! It really made me think and I'm glad I read it."
4,Must Read,"I had heard of this book, but never read it. I was a little surprised at how thin it is. It is basically a thick pamphlet. It is a must read each and every year."
5,Cashing in on a Second Home in Mexico,"This book is full of up to date info regarding the purchasing and renting real estate in various parts of Mexico. It has maps for locations and recent rules and regulations of real estate shopping. It is well laid out and well done. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of moving to Mexico and possibly staying there for an extended time. Thank you, Tom Kelly, for sharing your knowledge of a beautiful and cultural country for relocation."
2,A long Stewart Title brochure,"This book has good information about real estate ownership and purchase in Mexico, but it is repetitive and constantly touts Stewart Title. I felt like the book should have been edited to a fifth the size and given free."
2,Not as specific on mexican real estate as its name implies,"This book, although it does occaionally contain tidbits of information specific to the Mexican real estate process, contains alot of information general in nature such as chapter seven: ""Calculating your discretionary income""; or chapter nine: ""Strategies to find (and keep) good renters"".Much of the book is written more like a travel or tour guide such as chapter one: ""Top 10 locations that will appreciate over time""; or chapter five: ""Sharing the stories of people and places"" including ""a trip across the border to the dentist"".Pertinent and useful infomation is presented in chapter seventeen: ""Understanding taxes: what to expect from Uncle Sam""."
1,Dreary,"Sir Malcom Sargent cut his teeth in the pit for the D'Oyly Carte company. Based on the evidence here he spent the next thirty years forgetting everything he learned. This Mikado has the same problems that can be found in most of his EMI recordings, and even the later D'Oyly Carte Princess Ida - it is simply too slow and too meticulous to give any sense of fun. The singers all give the impression that they are slumming and would rather be doing Fidelio. The acoustic is annoyingly ambient.Give this one a miss and instead check out either Mackerras on Telarc or the excellent and underrated D'Oyly Carte set on Sony. Sargent is about as much fun as sitting in a mud puddle on a cold afternoon."
3,masks don't stay on,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED A LOCK, STOCK AND BARREL WITH CLAWFOOTED BATHTUB. CUTE BUT THE BOX STATED THAT THE MASKS ARE REMOVABLE... LET ME TELL YOU THAT THEY DON'T FIT OR STAY ON TO BE REMOVED."
3,Flawed DVD menus- Great content,"If you're reading this, you know the Jay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales are terrific and funny. Unfortunately, this compilation disk is flawed. The VERY irritating menu demands that you sit through too horrible trailers for terrible kid's movies before you can get to the main menu. They won't even fast forward or skip to main menu. Why would Sony insist on this very Disney-like irritation. What would Jay Ward think? This disk is for collector's, not brain-dead children who want to watch ""Frosty the Sequel"". The disk also has menu problems once you get to the main menu. I've contacted Sony and hopefully they will fix the problem."
2,it is not widescreen.,I am vary disappointed i would of never bough this if i new the screen was going to be so small!! The movie is not widescreen at all.
2,disappointed,"For a blu ray disk, how can Disney not even put it in ""widescreen?"" It's 2012, yet they leave it in 1.33 aspect and you get sidebars when you watch it. My kids don't mind, but it bothers the crap out of me.Beyond disappointed. If you are an audiofile, you'll be disappointed as well. At least my DVD puts it into 16:9.Have to give it 2 stars because it does look spectacular though. The only positive. Could care less about 7.1...it's not Jurassic Park. 7.1 on Cinderella is pointless."
1,Cinderella,"I purchased a two disc DVD set of the movie ""Cinderella"" (used). The one disc was said to have a scratch, but would play just fine. However, when I tried (several times) to play the movie, it would play about 60% of the movie and start over each time. I reported the problem and was informed right away thet my credit card was reembursed with the full purchase price.The point of this reviews is the fact that Amazon.com and ""Lets watch a movie"" stood behind their product and did not hesitate to correct the problem. This gives me confidence that even if things go wrong, Amazon.com will stand behind their product and do thre right thing for their customers."
4,A Classic,I bought this for a gift. It didn't have the paper sleeve covering the DVD. I really have no complaints.
5,The Disney Classic,"This is a Disney classic- a must have for any disney collector, a disney fan, someone with children, or just someone who just likes to watch good movies. I absolutely loved this movie, and I'm saving it for my children."
5,Awesome!,It was just like watching it when I was little. Gus Gus is still my favorite lil mouse! I def recommend for parents with lil ones and for everyone who is young at heart!
3,Not too sure,"I got the video very quick within 2-3 days so that part is great. However, the cover of the CD case looks kinda phony for a Platinum edition so I don't know if it's an original CD or a copy. Compare to my other Disney CDs I get, the quality is a bit off."
5,Cinderella DVD,I enjoyed it just as much this time with my granddaughter as I did when I was a little girl. I look forward to seeing it many time with all my grandchildren. It is just magical!!
5,"OCTOBER 4, 2005!!!!!","It's finally coming! There is a preview for it on the new Bambi disc!My well-worn tape from the mid-90s will at long last be replaced by a DVD! They've made us wait so long for this one and Bambi -- my Bambi tape is from 1989, quite fuzzy and dark -- I could hardly stand it!Rejoice, Disney animation fans! The date is set!"
5,great producer of products,Movie arrived in wrapper. New wonderful condition. My daughter wanted Cinderella and we just found out it went into the vault so the price was good and free shipping was a nice touch. It arrived in a nice amount of time for myself and it came when we were told it would be here. I would use this person again.
3,Buy two get -1 free,They advertise this product as two DVDs. I thought it is worth the price.However one of the CD is about film production and nothing that young kids find interesting. So remember that you are really getting only one useful DVD!
4,A True Classic,"This movie is a true classic and must see for kids of all ages. Memorable, enchanting, and completely engrossing; watching this movie will make you remember the magic of the first time that you watched it!"
3,"Beautiful clarity, awful color","Although this DVD is crisp and beautiful, it is a shame that Disney chose to alter the color of Cinderella's dress through out the ball scene. Her dress should be silver, as it is when her fairy godmother created it, and the color changes to blue in the moonlit scenes. But, in an effort to justify it's vast merchandising of a blue dressed Cinderella, Disney has chosen to alter the color in several indoor scenes, so that the dress is seen to be blue more often then silver. Why couldn't they just restore it correctly?"
4,"Classic movie, Awesome extras","With a wave of a wand and some silly words, Cinderella is digitally restored and lovely. Same old story, the mice are cute, the cat is evil, and the prince has no personality. And the extras are awesome.There's a mini documentary about the process Walt Disney went through developing Cinderella over a surprisingly long period of time. There are music videos made from storyboards for two deleted songs and demo recordings of half a dozen more. Random Disney Channel stars butcher ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"". There's a very Disney Princess music video made up clips from all the princess movies and that's pretty good.Cinderella went back in the ""Disney Vault"" already, I believe, so grab it while you can!"
5,Great service,"I received my package ahead of schedule and even though I was only expecting ""good"" quality my item was like new! :)"
5,Love Cinderella!!,"It's Disney: automatic 5 stars. I also love that Amazon offers free shipping, but keeps prices low. I always look here before purchasing anything from any other sites, just incase."
4,Cinderella,"My granddaughter loves this video, especially the music. The second disc is just extra baggage but all of the videos come like this now. Anyway, you can't beat Disney for kids!"
5,Cinderella,My granddaughter loves this DVD. It is just what she wanted for her birthday. It is also just as I remember it as a child. The only difference is the quality of the picture. It is much better now.
1,Unsatisfied!,"I ordered this DVD for my daughter's 4th birthday! She was ecstatic because this would be the first time to ever see the movie! She got on her Cinderella dress up clothes and sat down to watch the movie only for the movie to be of poor quality and to start skipping and then quit playing half way through the movie. Needless to say the smile went to a frown and tears started rolling. This was classified as new but it was only ""new"" because it was a copy. Don't recommend purchasing this product.The only positive to come of this would be it was delivered in a timely manner."
1,unhappy,"I couldn't wait to receive the Cinderella movie. I knew my 3 year old twin girls would love it! I was very disappointed when we started watching it and it skipped. I was hoping that it was just one time. Well, it wasn't. It skipped through the entire first half of the movie and then it finally stopped and had a black screen."
1,Cinderella DVD,"This DVD was suppose to be ""like new"" but did not work. It stops playing after a few scenes. Even after trying to clean it numerous times it will not play the whole way through. Very disappointed in this product!! My daughter was so excited to see this movie and now cannot watch it b/c it does not play. Will never buy a product that says ""like new"" again!"
5,VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SELLER,DVD and blu ray were both in excellent condition and I bought it used! Not even a finger print or smudge. Will definitely be purchasing more!
1,Never received this item - no stars here,This item was ordered two months ago but has never been received. I have tried to contact the seller but no success. I didn't take the time to read the reviews of this seller prior to ordering but wish I had. They were almost all bad.
5,cinderella is back,This classic is back and still an amazing movie my daughter and niece who are 3 and 9 love the movie and all of my daughters friends love it it is truly a time less classic.
5,Cinderella,Cinderella has been a favorite of mine since childhood.....what girl doesn't want new shoes and a Prince Charming. Works for me.
5,Excellent,The video arrived quickly. It was as described in the description. There is nothing wrong with it. I would recommend the seller!
2,Elementary,"This was my first ""Sherlock"" book. I am more accustomed to and highly prefer seeing this detective on film. Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett have spoiled me. I love mysteries but I didn't care much for this one. I gave it two stars, however, because I didn't want to be unfair-seeing as how I might be a bit biased."
4,kinda sturdy gun,"this gun seems pretty good. only thing that kinda bothers me is that the switch to make it full auto to semi auto is kinda hard to turn.sometimes i feel that i might break it if i turn it too much.other bad thing about it is that the little clips that holds the gun strap is very very very fragile. =(Descent Fps, very Solid, wish i could find a hi cap for this gun but eh...but this is a beginners gun or just something to have to shoot your friends with.other then tha the gun is excellent. 1 jam so far but i think it was my fault."
3,Cheap but useable,"A cheap Chinese knock off,feels durable.Decent English manual.The magazine it comes with is question and always fails to feed the last bb pellet.Fails sometimes to fire on semi automatic,fine on full auto.Very weak fps.Cheap red done scope included,I wasn't able to zero it in :/.Also comes with a ""loader"".The gun is made out of hard plastic,uncomfortable pistol grip.Also very inaccurate at close range (30 feets).But a human size object should easily hittable at this range."
3,so-so,"its a decent gun( i got mine for cheaper). the clip is moderate capacity, i would say about 50 to 70 rounds. i dont know the exact fps, but it isnt the greatest in the world. one thing you should know is that the first shot falls out the barrel, the second gets about 10 feet, the third about 20, and then it gets full range after that. so semi auto is useless on this gun."
1,Yikes,This book was tererible. I am a big Joe Namath fan. The author talked too much about Namaths youth and basically skims his time at Alabama and the pros. Gave it away and hope to never see again.
3,Works for a few days...,"This is a pretty good product when you first get it. My dog went nuts running all over the house when I put it on him, but for the first 2-3 days, the nail biting stopped. After that however, he must have gotten used to the taste because he started biting his nails again, the same or even more than he had before. I would reccommend this product, only because it did work in the beginning and some dogs I'm sure would not get used to the taste. Honestly, I sprayed a little on my own hand and tasted it and it was nasty. If I was a dog there would be no question that the habit would be kicked."
1,My puppy loves this stuff,I bought this to keep my puppy from chewing on stuff. Turns out he loves it. He chews up whatever I spray. I tried putting some on my finger and held it out to him. He started licking it off my finger while wagging his tail. Thought it was a treat.since that didn't work I tried some hot pepper spray from Ace hardware - Now that works great!
2,didn't like,"This product did not work, my dog still licked herself and even licked this product off of herself, was very disappointed, wasted my money."
1,My Dog Decided He LOVED To Chew It,"My dog suddenly decided to chew up his wooden barred play containment area. Nothing would stop him. Until this! This stopped his chewing immediately. And he once again decided his rawhide chews were wonderful.But then he decided he really liked this stuff, and actually increased the chewing of his pen. The center bar of his pen is now almost chewed through. I don't know what I am going to do now!"
2,This stuff did NOT live up to its name.,"It deters...until it wears off in 30 mins or so or until my golden retriever has accidentally rubbed it off. So, to really make it work you have to constantly reapply it to whatever surface or material you want your dog to avoid. That's tedious and a waste of money because you just have to keep buying it and applying it all the time. Save yourself the money and just be super vigilant when she is with you and reinforce with ""NO!"" and giving your dog her toy in place of whatever you want her to NOT chew on. My golden used to put her mouth on everything and she pretty much only chews her toys now because that's what I did."
3,Helpful... for a short time,"I read that this product is hit or miss with different dogs. Luckily, our puppy hates the smell and taste, but it is very fleeting. The product's effectiveness only lasts for about a day after sprayed. It is really helpful for immediate/short-term results. We use it if we find her chewing on something, and it works until the next day.So, it is helpful, and I do recommend it. Just expect to have to use it repeatedly on the same objects."
1,Does not work,Using this product is like spraying water on something. I did not deter my dogs one bit. I think they should make an alum tasting spray. That may work.
2,Not great,I have a 9 year old basset hound who has been eating his foot pad for a few weeks and just keeps making it worse. Our vet said to try bitter orange but this was the closest that I could find. I rub some neosporin on the pad then spray some of this on his foot. One problem...it's rubbing alcohol and/or nail polish remover. I felt really bad and my dog got pretty upset about it. He doesn't bite his foot but he still licks at it. I'm not really that impressed as it doesn't smell or taste like sour/bitter apple. Just like nail polish remover. I'm worried that it will make him sick so I've stopped using it.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,My dog is not deter d by this product at all. I would look into another product. maybe a pepper product would work but this was a complete waste.
5,Puppy training aid,This stuff really works to discourage dogs chewing on forbidden items -- just as I had remembered. Usually one taste exposure to a treated item will convince a puppy to leave it alone. We have used this item for many years.
4,Great for aches & pains,"I have been taking Vim & Vigor off and on for about 1 year now. I would let it run out, but after a week or so of not taking it I would notice how much more sore and stiff I would get. I have not noticed any weight loss benefit or extra energy, but I do notice how much better I feel in my aches and pains. I definitely recommend this. I always end up buying more after I realize I am hurting again!"
2,"Does not come with a slipcover, despite description","The description says ""slipcover zips off for easy cleaning"", but the product did not come with a slipcover. The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern. Now I have to find a slipcover that won't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath."
4,Grrrrrrrrrrreat!,Not perfect -- nothing is when it comes to sound reproduction. But this compact system is wonderful as a bedroom or travel system. It's especially good with vocal/choral and classical music.
3,Good Enough,"This movie is good enough to enjoy, however it does have its shortcomings. I love Robert Duvall in most things that he does but he just did not pull off this role believably as a German officer. Michael Caine played a quality role. But, I felt the best performance belonged to Larry Hagman. Very convincing blowhard glory seeker who doesn't quite get it. I love Donald Sutherland and enjoyed his part. He played the role as I would expect him to but I believe he was miscast in this role. One of the highlight s of the film is the cinematography. Beautiful scenery throughout.Could have been a better movie but good enough to enjoy."
2,This is an heavily edited copy of the original!,"I was absolutely shocked when watching this BR to find that it had been heavily edited from the original. Nowhere on the cover does it indicate this fact. The original DVD version ran for 134 min while the BR version only runs a mere 118 min. 16 minutes of material was excluded for no apparent reason and with no warning. Shame! Otherwise I agree with the other reviewers: the rendition is good, much better than the DVD version, but not great. The fact that I had to pay almost $50 for this is really sad.The Eagle Has Landed [Blu-ray]"
2,"As usual, a movie that pales in comparison to the book.","Unfortunately, the movie does not do Jack Higgins' best work justice. The cast is excellent and, at times, seemingly too realistic; however, the screenplay is a poor adaption from the book. The story is not developed well--which is disappointing because the movie's unexpected and thrilling plot is left out to dry. And most importantly, the finale is a HUGE disappointment--almost to the point of being anticlimatic. Let's just hope that Higgings' other espionage novels are not headed to the big screen."
5,With more than a dash of humor,"Fans of Phyllis Naylor's ""Boys Against The Girls"" series will delight in the new Boys In Control, which continues the saga of the Hatford boys and the Malloy girls at war. Here a thwarted baseball game turns into another competition between boys in girls in this story of war and underlying friendships, with more than a dash of humor."
5,Great reference,This book has everything the inspiring fantasy novelist could want to know about. And even for those who are not writing but just want to have information about either medievil or fantasy. I would definatly recommend this book to anyone from the novelist to the rollplayer
5,An excellent manual for teachers,"First of all, it should be pointed out that this excellent manual adhers to the principles of the Royal Ballet School in London. Many different aspects are being dealt with, for instance ""The importance of stance"", ""Comments on the teaching of boys"", ""Physical factors"". One very useful chapter is called ""The development of children with youthful skeletal age"". This book is aimed at teachers of beginners and intermediate students and they ought to study it carefully. It is very amply illustrated, the photographs are posed for by children of the appropriate age. One of the final chapters ""The build-up of a class"" in which each step is painstakingly explained, should be read, re-read and then read again by the teacher in order to convey the idea of perfect execution to the pupil."
1,DAVE CLARK WAS PROP DRUMMER AND A CONTROL FREAK!,"Dave Clark first of all did not play on most of the hit's...it was drummer Bobbie Graham.. Dave also credits himself with the song ""Because"" it was honestly written by Ron Ryan... So sad how Dave Clark destroyed this band using the members as pawns for his own self creepy creation! He was never a musician but wanted the starlight all for himself with his big red sparkle rodgers drum kit filling the whole stage with his amature bashing! he hides from society at all cost!....and has never given the other members a dime! shame on you Dave! your a real piece of work! and fan's are know knowing the person you really are!"
1,Pathetic and Superficial Tripe,It's sad that the world has become false and fake enough to welcome this drivel. It insults our intelligence when businesses have there employees wear fake smiles and kiss the bottoms of overly rude and obnoxious customers. A rude customer at times deserves it in kind and there are not always two correct sides to every customer altercation.I'm sure the tactics put forward here work fine for companies but small business owners (2-4 employees) who treat their employees poorly and always take the side of the customer are sorely misguided. Small business owners would be better served to use the positive feedback of their dedicated employees over the cruel complaints of a disgruntled customer.Any small business owner using these strategies only cares about themselves and obviously is not concerned with keeping their employees happy. It's difficult to get good and loyal help if you don't stand by your staff at times.
5,This is a gift!,I am a customer service representative who is using this book as a major guide to constructing a customer service department for an internet based financial publication. I have more post-its on my office walls than paint. I can't stop the ideas from pouring out of me or the book. It has to be in my small but possibly cosmic opinion this is the best book written on how to deal with people and their problems with a product or service. I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to better understand what their customers are thinking and not saying.Mario Viscardi
4,"Very informative, and immensely entertaining","I was assigned to read this book for a history assignment, but ended up not being able to put it down. I found some parts kind of wordy, but totally forgiveable. It is not only a great read, but informaative about the years leading up to Jackson's presidency. I would recommend this for both supplemental reading to a history class, and for pleasure reading."
2,important factors are wrong,this book was a bit disappointing because the author seemed more intrested in making it into a fantasic entertaining story than giving you correct facts.
2,Not as good as I had hoped,The game was too short and you are not given the freedom to do anything. It is the same thing over and over for each mission. The game was just one big advertisement for the show and nothing more.
3,A little fun,"I bought this game as a Christmas present for my boyfriend, who LOVES the Sopranos. He was so excited when he opened it and I watched him playing it (I don't get into playstion myself). It seemed like a pretty cool game and he was enjoying it. The only problem was he called me 3 days later and said ""I love this game, but I just beat it"". Apparently its just a really short game and it kinda sucks that it didn't last longer. I mean he's not some wierdo that plays games 24/7 and makes a living out of it, but he beat it so quickly that I'm wondering if I got my money's worth or not??"
5,An excellent index of Metric to Standard measures,"This is a witty and sensitive discourse of the metric system of measurements, it's impact on non-metric societies and the conversion tables used to translate one to the other."
3,Practical Guidelines for Entrepreneurs,This book was defineatly worth the read. It provides practical guidelines towards channeling one's passion in an effort to obtain profit.
5,Everything you need to know!,"I loved this book because it takes you through the process of having an idea and bringing it to life in tangible form. The author writes in simple, plain english. He writes as though you are a friend that he's talking to. That made it easy for me understand.I particuarly appreciate chapters 8-10 which provide the nitty gritty details that one needs to know in order to start a business but it's provided in a very engaging and entertaining way. It's not boring or dry. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to get throught it!"
2,boring,"needed for school project boring book, don't like kindle would rather have real paper book in hand to hold while reading"
5,Great Bean Bag Toss,"We bought this game to use at a ""carnival themed"" birthday party. It is very well made. The graphics are very nice. It was appealing to kids of all ages 2-14 (and some adults too)!"
1,Not Adjustable,I didn't realize that this product is not adjustable--- at all. It is for people with really really really big arms. Huge Arm. It is misleading I think. I would return it but don't see the point because of the price. I am disappointed though.
4,good value for money,1 I use them with canon Pixma ip15002 For regular paper printing these are good value for money.3 For photo printing the colors are not accurate and tend to bleed (thats why 4 stars instead of 5)4 Would definitely recommended them5 So far I have used 8 Black and 3 color cartridges and all of them worked just great
2,No optical viewfinder; stay away,"No optical viewfinder. I had trouble using the LCD to compose in outdoor shots. Washed out so badly in bright sunlight I was guessing what I was filming. Critical oversight in a camera this expensive. Then again, none of the HD camcorders from Sony or JVC seem to have an optical viewfinder. Wonder why?"
1,Poor Compatibility,"I researched and purchased the DCR-SR80 60GB Handycam for use in the classroom. After unpacking and testing the handycam I find that a special $100 driver needs to be purchased in addition to make it work with Mac systems. I was so annoyed that I returned the handycam and will avoid Sony products from now on. Most art schools and universities use Mac systems in thier art departments, so Sony has not thought this incompatibility out very well. I also don't care for the touch screen. It will be a place of inevitable corrosion."
2,Not too good,"This book was more a series of sparse vignettes than an actual story. The fact is, something will happen, and then on the next page it will have come to a conclusion without any information on how that happened. The story wasn't too good, and the characters were flimsy. Although Mr. Zndel is generally a brilliant, brilliant writer, this book just did not measure up to the standards it's being judged against. If you're looking for some real Zindel, try I Never Loved Your Mind."
5,worth the $$$$,This is the best corkscrew ever invented. Got it as a gift and have been buying it as the perfect gift for wine drinkers since....it's so easy it's amazing!! When you buy anything you get what you pay for. This is worth the money! I hope the inventor gets very wealthy from this.
2,Oh no...,"Lily Munster was GORGEOUS. This doll is not. It's nice that a doll was made at all, but I am not too pleased with the design. I saw this in a store and didn't buy it. The packaging is nicer than the doll itself."
2,Maybe a collectors doll but does not bare a resemblance and It is really sad!,"This doll does not bare a resemblance at all to Lily Munster, it looks like a male in females clothing. This is way to expensive for this doll! It may be a collectors item and grow in value so it may be worth it to purchase it. I am a fan of ""The Munsters"" and really love the barbie doll set with Lily and Herman Munster, as it bares a good resemblance of them but this one is rediculous."
5,buy for 2nd symphony,"never mind nos. 1 & 3 -- this is worth buying for no. 2 alone. this is the second digital remastering emi have done of no.2: the first (mid-80's) was horrible -- avoid. this one is much closer to the original 1973 lp. as far as i know, this second remastering of no.2 is only available as part of this set, i.e. not available separately.previn/lso made this recording shortly after returning from a tour of the soviet union where they performed the work several times. 27 years later, it is still one of the finest recordings of any orchestral work available on record."
4,Great service,Just what I was looking for and received the rack ears within a couple of days. Great service.
1,Not Impressed,"I am a senior in college majoring in history and I just finished writing a paper about this book for a college class, and after reading the other reviews for it here I feel I should write my own really quick to present a different opinion. It was a good book, and did give a good view into the lives of colonial women, but I'm wondering what anyone learned from it. There was nothing surprising at all, completely mundane. I do not feel there's a need to argue the importance of women in history, no one's writing any books about how great chairs are for sitting, it's understood. Of course no society could develop and function without women and all of the very important things they do, to me thats a given. Anyway, I wont go on any more but in my opinion the book just isn't groundbreaking or interresting on any level what so ever."
3,A Half Way Decent Collection of Hits,"The Happenings are the greatest harmony group of all times. I thoroughly enjoyed their renditions of ""I Got Rhythum,"" ""Sealed With A Kiss,"" and ""See You In September.""This CD, however, has a couple of flaws. First, the old Happenings LP I have with these songs on it sound much better than this CD. I thought laser technology is supposed to make the music sound better. What happened? The second gig, there is a lot of filler on this CD. Unfortunately, the filler material detracts from the solid performances on this CD."
4,Good beginners book,"THis book is good for people that don't know much about money or aren't very creative. But nonetheless it's a good ""bebinners"" book."
2,Rich dad poor dad for teens,"I read the original book and was excellent but this was not so good. Too small and difficult to keep track, is too basic."
4,Great book,I read this book when i was around 15 years old & it really got me thinking about finance & business at a young age. It got me thinking about going into business. I'm 19 now and i have already started my own business. This book was a great start to the many other business books that i have read.
5,Comfortable and Good Looking,"I have extremely wide and high feet, and I have a hard time finding shoes that fit. These shoes are extremely comfortable, and since they are all leather and pretty good looking, I feel comfortable wearing them to my business casual workplace. I've had this pair about a month and they seem to be wearing well. Also, people have approached me and commented, ""Are those Keen shoes? I love Keens. They're so comfortable.""-- I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys them."
3,doodlebop,"My son thankfully got out of the stage of watching this show. If you like the show, then you'll love the CD."
5,TOKYO A GO-GO ROBO BUNNY HIARI,"VOICE INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC PETHIARI THE BUNNYMAKES TONS OF SOUND EFFECTS AND REACTS TO YOU VOICE.HOPS LIKE A REAL BUNNY.TOKYO A GO-GO ROBOS ARE THE COOLEST INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC PETS AROUND. THEY RESPOND TO YOUR TOUCH AND YOUR VOICE. THEY MOVE AROUND, DO TRICKS, AND TALK TO YOU JUST LIKE REAL ANIMALS.- EARS LAY BACK WHEN YOU PET.- EYES LIGHT UP & CHANGE COLOR TO SHOW MOOD.- FRONT PAWS AND HEAD ARE POSABLE.- SECRET COMPARTMENT CONTAINS A COLLECTABLE CHARM."
3,Bratz Tokyo Gogo Bunny is cute and fun,"My seven year old daughter enjoyed this on Christmas morning. It's a cute, mechanical bunny the responds to you. I like it because it's a lot easier to care for than a real live bunny!"
4,Great start to a series,This book is about Cassie a foxy Fox and Quinn an Irish werewolf. The supporting character are well drawn. There is some good humor and overall a fun book. The plot isn't bad but a little weak particularly the villain's motivation. Nicely written erotic scenes but not the best; still not bad at all.Overall a very good read.
2,I wanted to love this,"Eons ago, I read (and LOVED) Fantasy Fix by Christine Warren. That book was brilliant. It was fun and fresh. Granted, it wasn't deep. It wasn't a thrilling, edge-of-your seat page turner. It was just a light, well-written escape, which is what I look for in a book. I guess I made an assumption when I bought this book. I expected something similar to Fantasy Fix. What I read was nothing like Fantasy Fix. Didn't finish it, and I haven't picked up any of Christine's later books, expecting they'll be more like this one. Maybe I'm wrong...?"
2,O-Kaaaaaay,"I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking ""Did I actually buy a book this bad.""Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book. Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.Because we don't believe in throwing money away, We're still stuggling to finish the book. Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel."
1,Rather boring to many Cliches,"This book was way to predictable to me.the characters could have been used a lot better and the fact that the villans follow everyday cartoons makes it worse. I love vampires and werewolves and the whole lot, but this just killed a lot for me"
4,Great quality and value,"Very nice upgrade from umbrellas I've purchased from local stores. The fabric seems sturdier, and the center pole and mechanism work smoothly and feel very solid."
2,Toyr R Us,toys r us has the 3 pack for less than $10.I thought Amazon was supposed to be the best prices...
4,Ravishing...,"Gorgeously played, sumptuously written. Nobody can play this music like Alicia de Larrocha. Recording noise notwithstanding, it's still fabulous and I'm buying my second copy."
3,"Good Movie, but Way Too Much Language","I recently rented South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut hoping to see one of the funniest movies I would ever see. However, the crude and constant use of foul language in this movie kept me from giving this movie a five star. On the other hand, the plot was very entertaining and funny and some language was nessecary to get the message across. However, it wasn't needed in a lot of places. If you are a fan of South Park, as I am, watch this movie. If you've never seen the show and want to see the movie frist, watch a few of the television episodes before sitting through this movie."
5,Fuh-nee!,"I am a huge fan of the show, & so I was worried when I heard there would be a movie. That is always the worst thing to do. But this movie was very intelligent, with commentary on politics, religion, & the MPAA. If you're a fan of the show, you'll love this movie, but I think even a few non-fan's are going to like this one."
4,"Great Movie, but NOT for kids","This is a great movie if you have a certain sense of humor. However, it is NOT for kids. For example, there is a brief gay male penis nudity in the movie (is why I docked the movie a star), which would be unsuitable for kids. In fact, I think the whole movie is not for kids. But if you are an adult, and you aren't anal and sensitive to insulting things, then this may be a good movie for you to watch. Here's an example. In this movie, Satan and Saddam Hussein are gay lovers. No kidding. Obviously, if you are even a little bit anal about this sort of thing, you will be insulted by this. But if you don't care about being insulted, then this movie may be worth checking out."
4,the best musical of alll time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this movie is a hilarious movie,..,but the thing is it doesn't really have any special features.Only 2 trailers and a teaser. i was expecting commentary or a behind the scenes, or something like that. but the movie still covers it. it is genious."
1,THE END IS NEAR,"I can't honestly give any of the episodes on TV five stars except the Hunting episode, ""BIRD!"", and this movie certainly isn't going to get 5 either. In my own opinion this movie is nowhere near Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE!, or The Blues Brothers. I am somewhat in awe it has the high ratings it does. Have you people seen Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE! or The Blues Brothers? How can you put it in the same category? Anyway, to dissect it. The intro song is good, I will give it that. Cartman has a few good lines throughout as usual. Saddam and Satan are funny. But for the most part .... for the most part the vulgarity is simply another aspect of a degenerate culture. You guys can do better and you know it. Remember the script for AIRPLANE! was written and rewritten for years before it was made into a full fledged B movie. Please take your time on the next one. I assume you have enough cash now that you will do it for artistic license and not simply to cash in"
1,A Real Disappointment,This movie is really terrible. It captures nothing of what made the TV show such a hit. The humor mainly depends on foul language. It feels as if these guys are running short of imagination. There is too much singing; it seems like they sing so much just to take up time. Don't bother with the movie. Get the video of the episodes.
5,"Brilliant, well sorta","When I first went to see it I didnt know what to expect. I knew that they were probaly gonna have alote of curse words in it(it did, 399 curse words) and I knew that they were probaly gonna afend some people( which it did, like Canada. But when it started the first thing i did was laugh! Emedietly they started off with stan singing a song about the town. (Its a musical.) Then the hole theater started cracking up too. It was full of songs, and horror, and commity. And near the end they showed Kenny whith out his hood on. I went back to see it 2 more times. I would sudjest this movie to true South Park fans. And you really need to have a good sence of humer."
5,"Hands down, the funniest movie ever made.","My one-line summary pretty much sums it up. I am proud of Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the testicular fortitude to create this movie and for putting up with the crap that the MPAA has given them. Bottom line, this is a movie that should be seen by all, for it has to be seen to be belived."
5,see this movie no matter what it takes,this movie is the best comedey in the 90s. everthing about is great half of the humor is never seen before and is funny as hell. without this movie i would have never cared to even watch the show so see this movie
1,The worst South Park,"Being a South Park fan, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie. Less brain, more cussing. Way too much singing. I never thought I'd say this, but I was looking forward to the movie ending."
1,"Don't watch this. Oh, it's funny, but . . .",". . . you do not want to see some of the scenes involving Saddam Hussein with Satan as his love slave. I'm serious, do yourself a favor and avoid putting those images of Saddam in bed with Satan into your head. Even thinking about it is bad enough, but they just push it and push it until you want to die for ever being exposed to it. Besides, there's way too many musical production numbers. South Park is great, but talking poop and this stuff is where I draw the line."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I am a great fan of the television series, but part of its appeal is the way Parker & Stone skirt the edges of ""acceptability."" But without those limits, their humour quickly degenerates into endless, and endlessly BORING, tirades. Admittedly, the first 15 minutes are hilariously funny; after that, don't waste your time or your money. This film is garbage at best."
1,nope,"Didn't like it-!!!!!!!! Too many songs , more of a musical than the regular awesomely funny show. If you like musicals go for it,although it's no Book of Mormon"
5,Don't Belive All Of Those Religous People,"This movie is very funny. who cares what they say about god and jesus. its just a movie. sure they say the ""f"" word alot but lighten up. let these genius do what they want. i hate how all those religous people judge others. well isn't that a sin. so since you judge....i'll save you a seat on my way down to hell and all of you can sit by me cuz this movie is the best of 99'. i take my hat off to matt sone and trey parker. great movie"
1,wife in name only,"This is a very dry and elongated boring book. Would never reccommend this book and will never read this author again. It is also quite sad. My only consolation was the book was ""free"". If I would have paid I would have demanded my refund."
3,Beautifully written,"A beautifully written well contrived historical romance. Perhaps a bit long and wordy...this is an excellent story about unrequitted love, revenge and sorrow."
1,great packaging.......horrible product,"Strolling into the local Target looking for a new phone for the dorm room, I spotted a cute looking phone...and it was on sale!! Cool right? Wrong! I ended up returning it because when I got it home and took my cute little phone out of it's great packaging, I discovered that by simple picking up the product I could tell it was cheaply made. Low grade plastic and horrible reception dissapointed me, and it also was very hard to change the outer color plates. Don't even bother!!"
4,Karma will not be denied,"NOTE: If you haven't already read the Amazon and Publisher's Weekly reviews, avoid them until after you've read the novel. They reveal key plot points that will diminish the book's impact.The poor inhabitants of a seaside Japanese village struggle to survive at the subsistence level. During the stormy season, they light the salt cauldrons all night in the hope of luring foundering ships to wreck themselves on the nearby reefs, where the crew will be killed and the ship plundered and disassembled. The story tells three years in the life of Isaku, a boy who must provide for his mother and siblings while his father is away in indentured servitude.By taking us deep into the daily lives of the impoverished villagers, author Akira Yoshimura allows us to understand how these desperate people can adjust their ethical system to justify murder in the interest of the community's well-being. Karmic justice awaits them, however, and the novel's finale is harrowing and melancholy."
4,A Japanese Fishing Village With An Unusual Tradition,"This is a quiet tale of life in a Japanese fishing village so poverty stricken that members of families must sell themselves into bondage for years to put food on the table. After ingratiating us into the yearly cycle of village life, the tale tells us of the villagers' rather macabre secret that keeps them alive, and the unexpected outcome of their activity. It contrasts their own judgments on their means of self-preservation -- by no means limited to them alone in the history of the world -- with the condemnation that would come from their neighbors. The book is simply written, interesting, emotionally involving, and compelling; very informative of how such villagers live. An enjoyable if strange story of what people do to stay alive. What a pity the ending has been more or less given away already in these pages."
2,Did not work for my cats,"I ordered this to use with my cats around Christmas time. I put my Christmas trees up in my dining room and thought this would be perfect to keep them out of my trees. I did not order an extra collar thank goodness, so at first I put the collar on the cat that gets into the most trouble with my trees. He walked up to the transmitter and laid down next to it. My son actually touched the prongs to see if it was shocking and it was working but my cat seemed to like it. He would lay next to it whenever he had the collar on. Then I put it on my other cat to see what kind of reaction he would give. He had no reaction to this device either. Maybe I have strange cats, but this really had no effect on my cats."
2,Was great while it lasted,"It was gret while it lasted..... but it did not last! After I invested in several pieces to this system, the collar suddenly stopped working. Amazon replaced it.... but then THAT collar stopped working as well. Because Amazon only covers you for 30 days, I am forced to go back to the manufacturer. Buyer BEWARE! This is a great system for only a short period of time!!!PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet Barrier"
1,TERRIBLE,"I bought this for my cat, cause it says it can be used on a cat. He keeps getting into food on the counter so I thought I could buy this to keep him off the counter. Well he is log haired and put it on as tight as I could and he felt nothing. It doesnt work dont get get waste of money and now I am stuck with it! ;o("
1,doesn't work for us,"We bought this for our 8 lb cat, to keep her away from the door (she likes to run out). Well, it definitely works... it shocked my husband when he tested it out on himself. However, it didn't phase the cat at all. I guess she wanted to go out more than she hated being shocked. There was also a few beeps and a delay before the shock, so many times she was long gone out the door before the shock even happened."
3,Good product ... could be better,"Bought this product to keep our dog away from the Christmas tree and it did the job perfectly. She (our dog) was only shocked two or three times and she learned to not even go close. We also tried to use it to keep her from running upstairs, however, she would run through it. I believe that if the beep was a warning beep rather than just an audible as the shock occurs that this product would be more effective."
5,Works great!,I have a high energy black lab and a golden retriever and they learned right away not to get near the couch! The golden retriever won't even go in the living room now! We also got one to sit on the trash can. After a few weeks we took the shocker away and they haven't gotten in the trash since! Have to get this!
4,"It worked, but it's not for us","We purchased this to try to keep our older cat out of the younger cat's food: Old Cat's special diet is ineffective if he eats too much of Young Cat's food.It did work when our cat's fur wasn't getting in the way or when it didn't spin around so the collar device was shocking the insensitive back of his neck (it's supposed to shock the throat). Old Cat does not have long hair, but like many cats, he has fairly thick fur. In the end, we decided this was not really what we wanted for our old furry friend.Like us, you may not even really know if this is something you're totally ok with or not until you try it. However, if you're even a little unsure about it, like we were, you might want to exhaust most of your other options first.All of that said, we would definitely consider using this for a dog who is both larger and younger than the Old Cat - that is, if we had a dog. It is certainly an easy to use product, and is sturdily built and pretty simple to adjust."
1,Inconsistent,"manufacturer recommends moving the prongs every 1 to 2 hours. and removing collar after 12 hours. might as well use alternative measure to restrain dog.works some of the time. you guess when.prongs need to make direct and constant contact with dog's skin. only way to assure this i found to be is making the collar too dangerously tight, so it became a choking hazard.when it was effective, with sufficient (not much) enthuesiasm, dog went through barrier.emitted barrier is quite weak. dog had to be directly, 180 degrees, in front of the unit for the signal to trigger the unit.returned to amazon."
4,This is a wonderful product,"We have a large dog and it works great to keep her out of the area/rooms (three) that we don't want her in. Even when the batteries are dead the dog does not ""push"" her limit too much, however inches in closer.The reason for not rating it a '5' is that the range is not as far as I would have liked and that the batteries do not last real long.Suggestion to the manufacturer would be if the dog is within the 'tone range' that it should shock it after a few seconds, which it does not do. Not until it moves closer. Maybe that is why the batteries do not last very long."
2,Good concept,"In theory, this should have been a great pet control device. However, the power of the actual collar unit was just too weak. You could hear it work, but my dog didn't react whatsoever. That's especially bad, since he's a small mini-pin.Overall, I would pass on this device since the collar needs refinement."
1,Don't waste your $,"Didn't work for our 12 pound terrier. Set it all up, put it on her, and she walked right up to the base unit and sat down next to it. SHe flinched slightly, as though it bothered her for a second, but she still didn;t move. Read over the instructions carefully many times & followed all of the tips and suggestions--nothing. Called the manufacturer, talked it over with customer support--tried all their suggestions--nothing. They kindly sent me a second collar unit, thinking maybe the first one was defective. The second one made no difference. It just didn;t faze the dog, so I sent the whole thing back. Disappointing."
3,quality?,product works but the transmitter collar broke within a couple of weeks.. company sent repair kit.. told them it was the plastic transmitter.. didnt think it could be replaced.. sent kit anyway.. you guessed... not right piece.. not open fri for holiday.. will call monday.. however.. fri 30 day warranty up.. hope i dont get jerked around.
4,Get Off the sofa!,This is my second one. 1st one lasted about 1.5 years. It keeps the dog off the sofa...he learned not to come near it even if the collar is not on him..
3,Great bike but it doe not have sound or a horn.,We gave this bike to our little Power Ranger lover for his fourth birthday. He loved the bike but the product description mentions a horn and sounds which this bike does not have. If you look closely at the picture there is no horn or swound generator. Overall it's a nice bike but we were disappointed.
1,Made in China garbage,"This is the single most biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen. First off, instructions are difficult to understand. Secondly, once you decipher the instructions, all the plastic pieces are warped and will not fit into place. I gave up after four walls and five hours and threw the whole thing in the dumpster and chalked what I spent on it as a loss. If you buy this after this review, you are an idiot. This product is awful."
2,FRUSTRATING!!!!!,"Spent many hours trying to assemble this product. Some of the pieces were very warped and would not fit properly. Think we finally had it fitted together and it would pop out in another area. Very tempted to throw the thing out but I do like a challenge! So, with the help of a very large mallet mission accomplished. Piece of advice...patience is recommended! Overall, nice piece for the deck if patience is a virture otherwise, SEND BACK!"
3,Serves it's purpose but not aesthetically pleasing.,Easy to assemble and pretty sturdy. It keeps the contents dry even in a hard downpour. The contact paper on the top & shelves is cheesy looking and has already started to curl on the edges. It would have been better-made with just the brown plastic finish. Definitely not a showpiece.
3,Suncast Prep Table,"I had always wanted some sort of handy table to use next to our gas grill and had never seen one in the stores so I went online and found this unit at Amazon. I like the basic design of the table. The assembly went well, not too difficult. The problem with this item is quality control. many of the plastic panels are warped and some are somewhat difficult to put together because of this. Two pieces were warped so badly that I felt that they were unacceptable ( one of the extension tables and the upper front door) so I called Suncast and they pleasantly sent me new pieces free of charge. I will use the table, it is on my patio now. I do think that Suncast should tighten up their quality control. ---Roudy"
2,Disappointed in the quality,"We were very disappointed with the quality of the item. The side and back walls, as well as the top cover, all made out of sturdy plastic, were warped out of shape when unpacked and did not fit together as they should. It took at least 4 hours to put the whole unit together. Even though my husband is pretty handy and can fix just about anything, he had a terrible time making the pieces fit together and had to make a lot of adjustments. It's nice and sturdy, but we will forever have to look at the warped walls and top. We do not recommend buying this unit on-line because you cannot examine the content of the box before you purchase it."
4,Prep Station / Storage,"I, like others, would be satisfied with the top being just a plain Suncast finish. Time will tell how well it stands up under a direct sun for 4-5 hours per day. It does a good job of keeping contents dry as I have found no water inside after a rainfall. I use it primarily for Grill ""stuff"" storage rather than a prep station. It serves my purposes well."
4,Attractive and convenient,"I was pleased with the ease of putting this item together. Also the appearance is very nice. The wheels make it extremely easy to move. The side shelves go up and down easily. The quality of the unattached inside tray is great. The only drawback is that the upper door sticks, so I have to pull hard to get it open, which then pulls the entire unit forward. If not for this little alignment problem, I'd rate it FIVE stars."
2,Missing half the parts!,"The good news is that this snaps together easily with no tools. The bad news is that the carton was missing the casters, the handles, and several other key parts without which the entire thing is worthless. Customer service seemed unsurprised about this, which leads me to believe their quality control isn't very good. They took all my info and said they would send the parts. It's been a week and I'm still waiting."
5,Fantastic Falla,"This CD of the music of the great Spanish composer Manuel de Falla is truly fantastic. This title, one of the few remaining from EMI's early 90s series ""Studio Plus,"" presents Carlo Maria Giulini and the Philharmonia Orchestra's golden-age stereo performances of ""El Amor Brujo"" (1961 with soprano Victoria de los Angeles!) and a suite from ""El Sombrero de Tres Picos"" (1957 & 1964). Though the treat here is Gonzalo Soriano's 1962 recording of ""Noches en los Jardines de Espana"" with Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and the Orchestre de la Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire. These classic recordings have been or are available in other CD incarnations (the Giulini recordings were on a budget line two-disc EMI Seraphim set, now out-of-print, and the same ""Brujo"" is on a recent Great Recordings of the Century disc), but this mid-line title is the best way to get both the Giulini accounts and the memorable Soriano/de Burgos ""Nights."""
5,A Look at Christmas Past (and Almost Forgotten),"This is the original old, dear cover and version of The Bird's Christmas Carol...I still own this version. It is a very sweet story of a little girl named Carol, (my name, incidently) born on Chrismas Day. One of the most enduring parts is when the Ruggles family next door is invited to Carol's home for Christmas dinner and gifts. Their getting-ready activities make for a wonderful, comic, but touching dramatic reading, which I did once. I am so glad to know this story still exists, long forgotten, probably. It's time to order it, sit down, and appreciate its intrinsic message! Worth every penny!!!"
2,Unreadable,"I hate to do this but it only deserves a 2 out of 5. Why, I hear you ask. Because it's unreadable. For example, there is no table of contents to give you any clue as to where the book is headed. There is also something about the writing that just makes you put it down for a very long time after each 5 page chapter.I'm a voracious reader especially of business books on entrepreneurship. But this is just unreadable. After having it for close to a year, I have only read about a third of the 44 chapters."
3,Works but not as wellfor all watches,"It does what it claims but the watch holder works best with adjustable length watch bands[leather buckel, velcro, ..]. My Rolex GMT kinda works if I use rolled up cadrboard to add lenght to the holder but is harder then to lock in to the turning mechanism. it is a very quiet machine."
1,"Do not waste your money, pay few dollars more and get a real watch winder.",This watch winder is made of rubbish; I have had it for 2 weeks now top rotator stopped in one week bottom one lasted 3 more days.
4,Great product for the price.,This is a great buy for the price and it serves the purpose that I bought it for. It is very quiet and don't feel if it is working. It works perfect for both the slots and keeps my watches running. I definetly recomend this product.
4,good watch winder,I have a rolex and this watch winder works very well. The only thing is that both top and bottom spin at the same time. There is no way to have just one at a time spin. It is a very quiet.
1,This book is boring,I found this book hard to read and boring. If you are interested in the subject by all means give it a read.
1,Really Boring,Really boring book! i had to read it for school and failed all of my quizzes! others might like it
4,Less than 100 pages; good read; free; what more can you ask for!,"For anyone wanting a good, quick, historical/non-fiction ebook to read in less than a day, then this ebook is definitely for you. Although, be warned, this is no substitute for the literature that Frederick Douglass wrote himself. This ebook provides a good, short synopsis of his life. Hey, my suggestion to anyone thinking about reading this would be to download it and read it when your either commuting, waiting for an appointment, in a coffee shop, or just hanging out in the park on a nice sunny day. Enjoy everyone and thanks Amazon!"
4,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave","This important figure in American history writes well in this interesting autobiography, telling of the horrors of being enslaved in early childhood as well as later. i enjoyed ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave."""
5,A must read!!!!!,"Frederick Douglass was a born slave. Although he was self-educated, he acquired an almost unparalleled level of education. He was a Christian, but a fighter - a fighter for freedom. He was the real kind of Christian. He not only fought for his freedom and escaped from slavery, but he fought relentlessly to aboliish freedom in the United States."
2,too much coarse language,"It was so distasteful I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters! It would have been better off they used less""F"" words!"
1,Interesting but outdated and repetitive,The book is a great reference if you are looking into sausage making from an extremely old world/traditional perspective.Probably my major gripe with this book is the repetition of recipes. The vast majority of the recipes are slight variations of one another. (This is because the book features sausage recipes from various regions of France-so the spice mixtures etc are only going to change so much).Its a neat book but the complete lack of pictures makes this a bad book for a novice. Unless you simply want a book on sausage to read and not to use-I would not buy this book. For day to day use it is not practical.
2,"Good, but....","This is a good book and a classic, but I vastly prefer Charcuterie by Ruhlman and Polcyn."
3,problematic heroine,"The hero of the story, Sam, is absolutely wonderful - romantic, funny, loyal. Jessica, on the other hand, is so withdrawn and has so many hang-ups that its hard to sympathize with her at times. She is a really nice person inspite of a hard childhood, and she also has her reasons to run from Sam, but at the same time the villainess Raye has a lot more fire than her. Of course, the drawback to spicy Raye is that she's pure evil, but at least she could never be called a coward. ""You Again"" is still a charmer, especially once Jess becomes a black cat, but Nicholson's ""Scent of a Woman"" is far better - I ADORE that book! The heroine in that one is just as fantastic as the hero."
4,Fabulous,"Beautiful. Simply beautiful. I have performed this piece myself and listened to many other recordings, and this is truly the best one I've heard yet. The only problem I have is with the sound of the sopranos in the Sanctus movement. Other than that, a true masterpiece."
5,.Hack//Legend of the Twilight #1,"I thought this was a great book. It was way different from the anime series .Hack//Sign. I thought it had great art and a great story line. It had lots of humor in it too. I would love to see the anime of this series. I still think .Hack//sign is better though. I remcommend this to anyone who loves .Hack//sign, the games, anime, or RPG games."
4,Where is the filling,"Wow,so this is what I got huh..Hack isn't very big on action,but don't let that stop you from buying it.Don't tell me all the good stuff is censored!!!.Ummmm...is Rena in love with her brother,because that is what it looks like.Whoa,are they allowed to show panties?What is every guy drooling over Rena?How can so many people be so peverted at the same time?!!If you like the show,by all means buy it.But for the rest of us,keep playing the game.I'll take the score up a little.Yeah,a four is okay."
3,what its about and what i think. =),"well, this manga is about this guy shugo and his sister, rena, are twins and they play this game where they fight others and also find items. i dont think its realli that good as it says on the cover ""the #1 manga in america"". it just has like this guy who is a total perve i guess...and he plays this game, which is like real to them...seeming like they're in the whole digital thing place...there is some kind of girl stuff, you know...the romance at the end where this guy likes her...blah..and then it ends..rite there. =) sorry for spoiling it..but theres more to it..but personally i dunt realli like it."
4,"Wild, Weird, Wired, Wow","The bitter irony of war is rarely captured without slipping into conventional stereotypes or contrived stories. The Big Red One central focus is the bitter irony of war . War is insane, and the longer you are in war, the more insane the average person becomes, yet at the same time there are moments of absolute beauty and peace. As far as stunning battle sequences, the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan beats this movie but the rest of SPR basically sucks. Big Red One on the other hand concentrates on a central theme of survival. The tag line at the beginning ""This is a fictional story about factual death."" says all there is to say about war movies. Are there flaws? Yes, just like any movie there are rough spots and inconsistancies. But unlike SPR, the director is more interested in telling a story than patting himself on the back. Watch this movie with an open mind and you too will be moved, shaken, stirred and drained."
5,Loved it - it made me so proud of my father,"My father was in the 1st infantry division in WWII. He stormed Omaha beach and was in North Africa with the Big Red One. This movie gave me some insight into the horrors of what it must have been like for him. Saving Private Ryan was a great movie,but I prefer this.The acting was excellent,the characters well developed,and the dark humor was so right for the situation."
5,The Big Red One,I am in my 60's and my father was in WW II so i like the old war movies and this is one of the many i have. This one has secens in it that i have never seen before. thanks
2,"Good Concept, Bad Execution","I was probably disappointed in this book because I expected something else. Basically, it can be compared to someone typing up a blog entry on anything and everything they can think of relating to Unicorns in book form. The book seems to be of low-budget printing (which the price suggests otherwise compared to the other books I bought that were better and $5). I would not recommend this book, even as a reference."
4,Classic,"So different from todays stories. The foresight of the author is phenomenal. Might not read again, but happy to have read it at least once."
3,Serious Comedy!,The Movie is a really good Comedy as well as a Gujarati film. the romance aspect is funny through the love triangle between three characters in the movie. a definite must watch.
4,good but not perfect,"Ultimately these little shelves accomplished what I needed to do: free up some floor space and help me keep things organized in my garden shed. Loss of a star is due to two things. First, as was the case when I put my shed together and I've read from several others, Suncast continues its tradition of having at least one hole or slot not line up quite right. A persuasion instrument, i.e. a rubber mallet, was required; I think even then one of the shelf supports was not locked in when I set the shelf in place. Second, due to the configuration of the brackets and the holes available on the inside wall of my shed, I couldn't put the shelf height exactly where I wanted it. I needed to go a bit higher than was my original plan. They are still great to have in there, and I would certainly rather have purchased and installed them than have not."
5,nice shelf,If you have a Suncast shed you will want these corner shelves.They snap together and will hold quite a bit.
2,A bit of a mess,"Unlike the earlier Flashman novels, Fraser tries a bit too hard when he decides to combine two fairly incongruent historical events, fighting pirates in Borneo with James Brooke and then ending up in the clutches of Madagascar's Queen Ranavalona I. (One of history's truly insane individuals that I was not acquainted with until reading this book) This one, as might be expected, is just a mess. Flashman on the run from cricket gambling thugs (Don't ask.) ends up halfway around the world as his wife has become the prey of an infatuated pirate. Gone is the semblance of reality often found in the other Flashman novels, instead we find a half baked plot, that lacks the focus of the novels I've previously read. Even for Flashman fans, this one could be missed with no problem."
5,"The Canal Locks at Lockport, NY","Length:: 2:59 MinsAlong The Erie CanalAt Lockport, Tom Grasso shows the five combined (double) locks of the original Erie, and the two Barge Canal locks which replaced them - and meet some old friends. More clips available on Google video (search term ""docfilm"")"
4,Hidden Track,"I don't know if anybody's commented on this before, but this is eerie: there's an early scene in this video, set in the Beatles New York hotel room, just before they're about to leave to tape the first Ed Sullivan appearance. John is noodling around on what looks like a melodion, tooting apparently random notes while conversation swirls around him. Then the notes resolve into something very much like the opening of ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" I swear on Brian Epstein's grave - that's what it sounds like. The pitch isn't exactly the same, but if you have ears to hear it you will hear it too. If you own this tape or DVD, check it out."
1,"Excellent movie, in terrible condition when it was supposed to be ""new""","I love baseball movies, and this one delivers a definite home run!I can't stand DVDs that have 3 of those irritating security tags on them. Really, even one isn't needed, given that they are sealed in plastic. But I can deal with one, usually. But three ALWAYS cause some sort of damage to the case, if not to the DVD itself.Be careful of the DVDs that claim to be ""new"". This one was supposed to be, but it's all scratched up and won't play, even after I ran it through a DVD cleaner that repairs scratches. Not saying anything against other movies, just this one. I guess it's impossible to tell until you get the movie, but I'm disappointed."
5,Fear Strikes Out,"Perkins plays young Pearsall with just the right vulnerability, and Malden does a breathtaking turn as his driven Dad. An over-looked classic from young Mulligan, who'd go on to direct ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" five years later."
1,This movie was BLOODY AWFUL!,"My husband & I agree (for once) that this is the worst movie we've ever seen! The story line was horrendous. But MY least favorite thing about this movie was the EXTREMELY REDUNDANT use by the little 'computer geek guy' of sterotypical British verbage, (...)"
1,What a Piece of Junk.......,"This movie was one of the worse things I've seen since oh I can't even remember. Best Described by the whinny words of Luke Skywalker, ""What a Piece of Junk"" and the worse part is. No one can stand up for this thing and say, ""She'll make .5 past lightspeed"" Or anything else that is good. The best thing the movie had to offer was a remix of U2's Elevation."
1,Awful!! This should be buried in a tomb!,"THis is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know the game it's based on so perhaps I can't complain.It is still awful. No substantial plot, no dialogue, no acting, no directing, no talent.I would sell my DVD copy but I don't want to afflict this bad movie on anyone else."
2,"Well, you can tell this was a Summer movie.","This movie is definitely not trying to win any awards or trying to be taking seriously. If you want to watch something exciting and stylish knock yourself out but you won't be thinking about this movie much afterwards because of two main reasons. One, there's barely any character development at all through out this picture. The only character that gets a little and I mean little focus throughout the whole film is Lara and even that's minimal. Second, is the fact that this movie runs essential on the standard save the world from an ancient object bit. If they make a sequel it will have to be about something more involving next time to get my money. In conclusion, Tomb Raider is your average action movie with pretty woman and an established name attached to it. Worth a rental but not much more than that."
5,Let us be honnest...,"Okay fellow lovers of the PC game, this is about making a movie that everybody's asking too much about it. Right Lara Croft is really something and besides her little nasty attitude, she looks good on screen.Like it or not, at least someone did make a movie out of it, and for that we have to be gratefull. On my side, i think that any Tomb Raider fan will have to get this movie anyways. As far as i'm concerned, I must admit that I enjoyed it a lot :)See by yourself..."
2,Here's hoping for a good sequel,"Tomb Raider is a good idea. It's always been a good idea, and so when I see it in the video game store or playing at the cineplex, I want to try it out, because it's such a good idea. Unfortunately, a good idea isn't everything, and no Tomb Raider product has ever fully capitalized on the ""idea"" of Tomb Raider, and this movie is a prime example. For roughly 100 minutes, we watch Lara Croft chase after some guy, blow stuff up, fight supernatural beings, and blah-blah-blah... why don't I care? Because she's an adventurer, but in this film, all she does is follow the bad guy. If you want to watch Angelina Jolie for 100 minutes, this film is good for that, so give it a rental. Just like with the video game series, I'll keep waiting for a sequel that truly capitalizes on the good idea of Tomb Raider."
3,"Great action, so/so plot","The movie is great if you're a fan of the game, which quite frankly, i don't know a playstation fan who isn't. Angelina Jolie fits Lara Croft so well, and the Simon West and Angelina made the write choice on Angelina doing most of her stunts, because if they had a stunt double for every stunt, Angelina wouldn't be in the movie 85 percent of the time, the plot is good but not great, like most video game or comic movies, the plot is not the case, it's the action and the potrayal of the characters. The movie itself is good, a definite must see for Video Game fans."
2,Terrible Waste of Jolie's Talent,"Angelina Jolie was absolutely fabulous in ""Girl Interrupted"" and ""Gia."" She's an absolutely gorgeous woman with acting talent to match--quite a combination. Why she wasted her talent on this film, an overblown cartoon about an Englishwoman type superhero, is what I can't understand. Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre. If you like fight sequences, you might like this film. If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it. That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else."
1,Another Bad Creation!!,"This movie is a very bad representation of a very good video game! When the original Tomb Raider video game was released, it revolutionized the gaming industry. Never before had a game possessed such excellent 3-D graphics and gameplay. Combined with a solid storyline that involves deceit, treachery, and a hint of supernatural, and you've literally got the video game equivalent to Raiders of the lost Ark, one of the greatest movies of all time!The Tomb Raider movie is far less dynamic. It doesn't have a good storyline like the game and lacks the cleverness and whit of an Indiana Jones movie so, instead, you get a rip-off of both! The action is far too fast-paced to be even remotely believable. Furthermore, the end of the movie is EXTREMELY anti-climactic (nuff said). Anyone who is a fan of the excellent video game or of Spielberg's superb Indian Jones movies will be very (I stress very) disappointed with the Tomb Raider movie. Not even worth renting."
5,MASTERING HER CROFT,"Hey, what the heck! This is a movie adaptation of a video game, for pete's sake. What do you expect? This movie is flashy, fun, wildly ridiculous, campy, and adventurous. Angelina Jolie pouts and moves appropriately; the action sequences are well choreographed, and the bad guys lose. What more could one want in this type of movie. Iain Glen is sufficiently villainous; Daniel Craig is a hunky, if traitorous, former associate; Chris Barrie is delightful as Lara's manservant, Hillary; and Noah Taylor as nerdy Bryce couldn't be better. Grame Revill's score is nice, and Simon West's direction, while not all that original, moves the film along.One shouldn't look for Oscar caliber material all the time; just sit back and watch instead of play the video game movie!"
1,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider,This was absolutely AWFUL. This movie was played up as being super. Just the opposite. The acting was terrible.
1,not that into it,"I just finished watching this movie. I'm not a very big fan of it. The only parts I was interested in watching was the beginning and the ending. Ending Starting with the dogs. Angelina did a good job, but its just not for me."
1,Not worth the time!,"I tried two times to get through this movie and fell asleep both times. The opening scene is by far the best part of the movie - It is all downhill from there. Who's bright idea was it for Angelina to talk with an accent? Accents are not easily faked!!! There is no plot - just a lot of focusing on Angelina's great body, which if you are a guy - that's not a problem!!!! Angelina has several other movies that are more worth the time!!!"
5,Lara Croft - We need more,Great female action movie. We need more like this. It holds your interest.
2,I hope The Cradle of Life is better...,"This movie is sad. The action is cool but farfetched, the woman is attractive, and the story is alright. But not the overall movie. For one, it is too short. The story is about an archaeologist Lora Craft (the feminine Indiana Jones) who discovers a clock that when put in a special tomb during the planetary alignment gives man the power to control time. Croft must beat any evil force to it for it could be used for destruction. She also wants to see her father again. But when she does, he tells her not to use the device anymore. YAWN! No twists, no turns, and the movie heavily lacks gore. I can't take too much blood, but this is another RoboCop 3! Rent it before buying or even better see it on HBO or SHO or whatever movie channel you have. You'll be doing yourself a favor."
1,Plain and simple... I did not like this movie...,"It captures the feel of the game... and if that right there doesn't tell you that the... thing is boring, I don't know what else to tell you... the supporting cast needs all the support they can get, and the only thing that Joile excels at is LOOKING like Lara Croft. How bout some feeling in your performance next time, lady? And when I say she LOOKS like Croft, I'm not kidding.. I heard rumors that she was ""enhanced"" for the role, if you know what I mean... Lack of a good plot also makes my head hurt. Paper-thin adversaries seem one-dimensional, and we learn little to nothing about her father to make us even care about that little reunion in the movie. I stopped the DVD and looked at Trigun..."
1,"Worse than the last ""Batman"" film!","Amazing! This film is worse than ""Batman Forever"", one of the few films that had me running from the theatre. Bad casting (the ""super-weirdo"" Jolie as Lara Croft?? What were they thinking?), pedestrian action sequences, a bad ""script"" and a large budget mixed into an unwatchable mess. Did'nt the producers of this sewage watch any ""Indiana Jones"" films to see how Tomb Raider should have been made; or even play the game?To quote Leonard Pinth Garnell: ""Simply awful, could'nt have been worse.."""
5,Tomb Raider,"this movie is just awesome, unbelievable, and wonderful! Angelina Jolie is just breath-taking and an amazing actress and a hottie!"
2,Where's the action?,"I was looking forward to seeing an exciting action film, maybe with not much plot, but at least some kick [bottom] action scenes. Instead, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider graced me with nothing much more than excessive [breast] shots of Angelina Jolie's stuffed bra. The story was just not interesting, weak at best, and there was nowhere near enough action scenes to keep me hooked into this movie. Even Lara Croft's semi-romance interest was nothing much to look at. I can't believe they're making a sequel of this non movie. I would much rather play the video game. Watch the Indiana Jones movies for great action, or even more recent films like the Matrix. At least they don't disappoint. The only really good thing about this movie was the soundtrack."
4,Angelina Jolie is excellent,I believe that Angelina Jolie is the only actress that could pull off a video character. She has the great range as an actress. The acting and scenery was equally great. The story had a great connection. The storyline really pulls you into the movie and the action. The movie has some very funny moments and is fun to watch.
3,Well I for one think this is pretty good.,"When I rented this for the first time I thought to myself that it would no doubt be as horrid as all those other adaptation films that came from video games. Once I actually watched it however my opinion changed. Now I think that it's actually a good movie. Now I will be the first person to tell you that it cannot stand on it's own. In other words you have to appreciate and know a bit about the games and the main character before you have a chance of thinking this is a good film. However compared with all the other adaptation movies that is a good thing, not a bad thing. Overall I say that if you like the Tomb Raider games and already know a bit about them and the character then watch it, you will like it, otherwise play the game and forget the movie."
1,Leaks Horribly,I returned this item after 2 uses. The leaking was so bad that my water pressure at the end of the hose was about half of the original pressure. I would not recommend.
1,the weakest link is as good as it gets,I monunted the reel between two vertical posts at a comfortable level to work the handle. The problem with the unit is the connection from supply line to the fitting on the reel. The connection disconnects when water pressure is opened.Unfortunately this makes the reel virtually useless.
1,uh...dud,goods: geat castbads: everything elsethe movie proves that lots of money don't mean a good movieoverall: no thanks
2,"Fantastic PQ, awful movie.",Reference picture quality on HD-DVD. Basically unwatchable though. I would not recommend the blind buy on this one.
4,"Action, Adventure, and Archeology","This movie is a feel good, save the world movie with an archeology twist. I think that Matthew McConaughey steals the spotlight in this movie as he tries to in every movie. But, for me Rainn Wilson is always a big draw. With the office turning me on to his career, he seems to bright a funny yet serious role in all his films. Of course Penelope Cruz and the rest of the cast are great with amazing chemistry.The sound and video quality is better on blu-ray as always. This makes it a good buy for me at the low cost I got it for."
4,Very Fun Movie!,"I keep my reviews short and to the point so in my opinion, I really enjoyed this movie and there was great action & adventure along with alot of comedy. I recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies."
3,Sahara (Widescreen) Good Action!,"This one starts out a little slow and slowly starts to pick up speed until the action continues on for the rest of the movie. In the vain of the Indiana Jones features this movie has lots of bad guys, lots of heros/heroiens and pretty good high speed chase sequences. There is humor, sadness and likeable characters all around. The PG-13 rating seemed a bit low for this one (in my opinion) but none the less you will enjoy watching this one with the teens and pop-corn on the side. Good Saturday night fare."
1,The bottom of the Pitt of shame,"What an appaling waste of time this little number is. We all love the mindless excitement of films such as Armageddon, Top Gun, Gone in 60 Seconds and other high concept, high camp action adventures. Films that give us nothing but explosions, tension, the occasional laugh, all wrapped up in a neat package after 100 minutes.This film does not achieve any of that.If people think that this film (set a good couple of hundred kilometres away from the Sahara?) is the dawning of a new Indiana Jones then they are sorely mistaken. It's not escapism, it's not fun, it's just dull, totally far fetched and unfortunately, not funny or witty in any way.I'd have to classify this film by saying it's two hours of my life that I'll never get back, and for that I am truly regretful."
2,Read the book!,The book is much better. Mathew is glib and the movie fails to capture the essence of the book.It just doesn't work very well.
1,Stinkohara,This has to be the worst Indiana jones/national treasure wantabe movie ever made. Do not waste your time. Compared to this Santa Claus vrs the Martians is an academy award winner.
2,Gimme a break!,"Sahara didn't do much for this reviewer. The performances were drab, the story was convoluted, and really....the movie was just boring overall.I just didn't care about these characters, the plot (something to do with the worldwide poisoning of the water supply...blah blah blah), or what was going to happen next. After about 45 minutes into the movie, all I began to care about was when it would end.Sure the movie is scenic and the backdrop is quite impressive, but without any good plot or characters to involve myself with....""Sahara"" ended up failing miserably.I'd put this movie right up there with ""National Treasure""... which isn't saying much at all.Just a big ol' mess from start to finish.Disappointing!"
1,Overally critical of hansom actors (and third rate action movies) - and loving it!,"Unfortunately, I concur that this movie is a formulaic boar. (Just trying to keep in the spirit of illiteracy). Although all the others needed this ""career boost""(?), William H. Macy ought to be ashamed of himself. (Positively brilliant in ""Boogie Nights"".) ""National Treasure"" and this are two of kind: thin, cynical rip-offs with actors (McConaughey and Gage) needing to restart their fizzled careers. Both are just the right type of cardboard to fit the Q-survey parameters."
3,Good for a cold winter day,"Not fully engaging, but pleasant to watch. Alot of sunshine in this film. Great locations, passable but not inspiring direction, likeable but watered-down characters, action is OK, not particularly thrilling. Thought this film would suck, got it on a whim at Megalo-Mart for $[...]. Light-weight, but still enjoyed it, will watch again someday. Good for a stay at home date when it's freezing outside and you want to curl up with your sweetie."
1,After Reading the Book.......Trash,"I am a fairly big fan of Clive Cussler, the author of Sahara, and have really enjoyed his novels. Sahara was one of my favorites, so I eagerly anticipated this movie. Within the first 15 minutes, I had to turn the movie off. It's absolute trash. The characters (Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and Admiral Sandecker) are EXTREMELY poorly cast, which is my primary gripe. The casting is so poor as to be the equivalent of casting David Spade as Rocky, or the Rock as Michael Corleone in the Godfather. Nothing against the actors themselves, but they simply do not fit the roles. It's as if the director never read the book, and had only heard the plot through word of mouth. I beg you to read the novel, which is more of an adventure than this movie could ever dream of being."
1,Should have been left in the Sahara,"Well, this won't take very long. Warning! Spoiler here!Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation. Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation. One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing. Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara. Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake.Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that. Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time."
4,sahara,"The movie was a well paced.Plenty of action and the ending was very good.With better high tech, this film had many similar scenes to Indiana Jones,so the film was not as creative as IJ.If a sequel is to be done I would suggest a better scirpt for leading lady or a different woman.I would recommend for action fans to see this movie."
4,"Adaquate, derivative, action movie.","As a long-time fan I was pleased by this adaptation, sure there were parts that upset me, but all-in-all I thought it was pretty good. I hope that true fans of the series will get behind the release of the DVD so that hopefully a franchise can be started. Hopefully the producers may ask fans for some input next time. Overall, a relatively bloodless action film suitable for families who liked National Treasure, Raiders, etc."
5,very interesting series,"for all that are interested in the ""last days"", this is a must read. Some things have already happened which gives it credibility since it was written in the past of its happening."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"Being a huge S.E. Hinton fan when I was in my pre-teens, I was excited to find this adult book written by her. However, I was greatly disappointed that the language was very strong and honestly made me, as an adult, uncomfortable. I really hope Amazon will remove this book from being listed under any category for teens or children, as the language is not appropriate for this age group. The words used in the book would make a movie rated R. Just a warning to parents out there, and any adults who do not appreciate foul language in novels."
1,Hawkes Harbor is a Hoax.,"Every October, I choose a scarey book to read in honor of my Halloween mood. I regret to say that this was my choice this year. I would be embarrased to put my name on this work of dribble. Thank goodness I still have time to go out and find a real author to read."
1,Great Disappointment,"I was excited to learn that S.E Hinton had published a new book, and greatly looked forward to reading this new novel by one of my favourite authors. I think ultimately, S.E Hinton should have just left well enough alone. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this book hugely disappointing. It was limp and boring; the plot ""twists"" were obvious, and the characters were transparant. It almost felt like she was trying to channel Bram Stoker but ended up with Anne Rice instead...I do not recommend this book."
3,touching&insightful :),"I, like so many others reviewing, LOVED S.E Hinton and her books that I read as a child. The Outsiders is still my favorite book. I finally picked up Hawks Harbor (I got it as a gift from my sister who knew how much i loved Hinton,) and I fell into it within the first few pages.I admit it is confusing at times, trying to remember what date it is taking place in. (so if you do read it, take note of the year stated in the chapter title!)But in all, I loved this book. I loved Jamie. I smiled when he was happy, I cried when he was sad. I most definitely got attached to the characters from the get go and would definitely recommend this book to those who are looking for a deep and intriguing book."
1,Fan Fiction,"I initially bought this book b/c I was excited that a Dark Shadows fan fiction had actually been published in mainstream. The onlyreason why I liked it in the slightest was b/c this story contains a favorite character of mine: Willie Loomis. Oops. I mean ""Jamie Sommers"". *wink* :p I think this was very poorly written and very anti-climactic. Just when I found a certain part exciting, she revealed it's outcome before reaching the ending. That alone was like watching a movie with someone who leans over and tells you what happens at the end when you're right smack in the middle of that movie. I would NOT recommend this book."
4,Great nightlight alternative. Never replace a bulb. Dirt cheap to operate.,"Several companies sell this exact same light, included one sold at Home Depot. It's a single LED light that uses 0.3 watts. You will never need to replace the bulb. Light is slightly blue in color. It does not put off as much light as a 4-7 watt standard nightlight bulb. It seems brighter when viewed from above, such as from a floor outlet."
3,Fun and Boring All in One!,I bought this for myself right before Christmas.I played with it for awhile but in no time I got bored with it. I also got frustrated with it because Madison's hair got all matted up as soon as I got her out of the box and their clothes started unraveling too! (and I don't play rough with my toys at all!)
2,"poor delivery condition, printing irregularities",I read alot of period fiction Robert Howard being among my favourites. I was waiting some small time for this second volume in the series.I could've saved my money! 1. The two copies I ordered (in hardcover) were in awfull shape and 2. One of the two copies had an additional signature of blank paper half way through the book. A very amateurish package for a series giving it self such great airs as this one is. I'll be sticking to purchasing the electronic PDF versions from now on (not that these do not have there own short comings) but at least it isn't a mangled ill printedhardcover which wasn't cheap either!
4,Brother Bear 2 - Good Sequal,"I expected this sequal to be as great as the first one, and to that end I was a little dissapointed, however, this is a different kind of story, with a very interesting twist, that held my attention. It was a very good story, and great for children, of all ages."
5,Halloween Fun for the WHOLE Family,"If you're looking for a family show to watch on Halloween, or any time of the year for that matter, you'll want to pick up What's New Scooby Doo? Vol. 3 Your children will enjoy the frolics of the Mystery Inc Gang as they solve crimes dealing with a vampire, mummy, sea monster, and yes, a High Tech futuristic house. As my 13 year old son says, ""These cartoons have a plot, they draw you into the show, and they're fun to watch."""
3,for older kids than Scooby Doo Where Are You,"My 5 year old loves the Scooby Doo Where Are You dvd I picked up for him last year so I picked this one as a Halloween present. I didn't realize What's New Scooby Doo was a different series, it was not on tv when I was a kid. The episodes are a little scarier and the characters are less pleasant. I don't remember Daphne being such a stereotype of a dumb, self-centered pretty girl in the old series. In one episode one of the minor characters calls his brother a ""pea-brain"". My kids (5 and 2) find this hilarious because they think he's saying ""pee brain"" and now call each other that non-stop. sigh"
4,Disappointing Ending,Good read right up until the very end. The well-written characters and wonderful descriptive prose keep you turning the page. I was a bit disappointed in the ending...I was hoping for a more dramatic resolution of the mystery.
3,where in the world is the plot to this book?,"I agree that this book is well written, and has some beautiful phrasing at times,hence the three stars. However, the plot development is poor and the character development is awful. The characters are just plain boring, although it seems as if the author is trying to pass them off as eccentric. The end is so incredibly frustrating. I felt as if I'd slogged through over 400 pages of redundant, stagnated plot and arrived nowhere. Who killed Mary Evelyn? Who killed the woman at Mirror Pond? What's going on between the sherrif and Maude? What's going on between the main character's mother and Lola Davidow? Is she indebted to her in some way? The only thing that got answered was who killed Ben Queen's wife. It's almost as if Martha Grimes just lost interest in the story toward the end. I will try another of her books, because she writes well, but I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're already a fan."
5,Wonderful Loretta Young Television Episodes !,3 great episodes of the Loretta Young Show. You can't miss when you watch her entertain you. She was a beautiful Queen Of Hollywood. Fans will love this.
5,Judge this book by its cover ...,"The main question I had before beginning this book was 'could the story live up to the jacket design?', the answer is yes.Maybe it was the knowledge that Marlon Brando wrote (some of) this book that I immediately saw his likeness in the main character of Annie. Regardless, his presence is the main selling point and the main entertaining point of this fine novel.I wonder whether we could read about the further adventures of Anatole Doultry through the eyes of the editor (David Thomson) who made a (fairly) seamless transition to authorship in the final chapter."
2,Poor Johnny,"I absolutely LOVE JD and would probably pay money to see him read a phone book. After seeing this horrible movie, watching him recite the Yellow Pages would have been highly preferable. Even Depp's talents and sex-appeal could not save this stinker of a movie. I have to rate it a 2 simply b/c Johnny was in it- lol!"
3,"Depp is very good, but movie isn't","This movie doesn't explain many of the questions it raises, it's illogical, and it's ultimately not very interesting. But it is worth watching just to witness Johnny Depp's versatilely as an actor. He is the rare actor who is a true chameleon, and, even when the movie isn't very good, he is always interesting to watch. Here, he plays a southern, good-old-boy, macho astronaut. Without advance notice, no one would know it was Johnny Depp. I don't agree with the Amazon review at all; his Texan accent is very real and not cornpone at all. But this is Theron's movie, and Depp's part is not big enough to salvage the movie."
2,Very uncompelling,"Like many viewers, my expectations were low. It's a shame. Some good performances are really wasted here. Johnny Depp is truly creepy as his face twists into its more intense form while the movie drones on. Most of the secondary actors were pretty good (esp. Donna Murphy and Joe Morton). Charlize Theron was not enough to carry the movie though.The plot was ho-hum, and it was paced poorly. None of the relevations were surprising, or interesting. The ""twist"" ending was executed poorly. Some pretty high lameness all around.Only get this if you are a big fan of the principal performers."
1,As bad as it gets,"This movie has it all: bad writing, poor acting and cheap production. I watched, because Johnny Depp has usually been in good movies. This was a mistake for him, and a mistake for me to watch. The writing was so flawed, it is hard to comment on it's inadequacies. It wasn't like there was a few missing links or non-sensical scenes; there seemed to be no attempt at coherency."
3,An flawed but at times Strong Sci-Fi Thriller.,"Two American Astronauts (Johnny Deep & Nick Cassavetes) are in a Space Mission and they crossed a Near Fatal Death. When they come back to Earth. One of the Astronauts wife (Charlize Theron) is Pregnant with Twins but she becomes Paranoia, Since she thinks is not her husband (Deep) and she think that a alien lifeform using her husband body and her unborn childern are aliens.Directed by Rand Ravich brings a Stylish Thriller but this lacks Geniune Suspense. Deep and Theron gives Strong Performances. This one is slow-moving but Well Made. DVD`s has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.82:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This film plays like the Sci-Fi version of Rosemary`s Baby and Actress:Theron almost replays her role from the Devil`s Advocate but still it`s a watchable film. Grade:B."
3,Could Have Been So Much Better,"Great premise, although not exactly innovative storytelling. Good acting and great to look at. The storyline wears thin and the ending feels too predicable and easy. Acting quality is very good, which leads me to believe a little more care with the script and pace could have made this really good and worth seeing more than once. Entertaining though. It keeps you watching. Good movie for a Saturday afternoon."
5,Gaucho's Samba Bonita!,"Ronnie's sambas are catchy, kitschy and fun. The CD is a feel-good choice for anyone wanting to conjure the lighter side of Brazilian life-sand, futebol, sun and samba. This isn't favela funk (baile funk) people! This CD is for those moments when life is good and you feel like dancing."
3,"Has its laughs, but not what I expected","Citizen Archie was just not the comedy you would expect. As always, there were the funny moments, but there were several other episodes they could have used instead of the three they put on this tape. It is hard to select the most funny episodes to put on a tape, especially with a subject like Citizen Archie.The episodes they put on this tape could have been better, and if not for the few comedy moment, and the fact that I always liked to watch All in the Family, I would have rated this lower.I would not suggest this tape if anyone ask for my opinion."
4,Very Well Put Together,"If you are looking for a general introduction to the turbulent history of Russia in the past century, I highly recommend this book. I originally purchased this book to ""fill in the gaps"" of my knowledge, primarly 1945-1975 and 1991-modern day. Though I commend the author for cramming 100+ years of history into a very engaging 550-ish pages of material, my sole gripe is the lack of detail spent on the period between WWII and Gorbachev. But, like I said, it is an entire 100 years in a single book. All things considered, it is very well put-together and an enjoyable read."
3,Great Russian History,"A History of Modern Russia by Robert Service is a fascinating account of the events that begin with Nicholas II and lead all the way to Vladimir Putin.Sometimes a few sentences is worth the price of the book. The author contemplates the death of Stalin and describes the process of embalming and the funeral that took place. Service adds, ""A silence was meant to descend over Moscow. But such was the crowd in the nearby streets that a commotion broke out. The pressure of bodies led to dozens of fatalities. From under the glass the chemically-treated corpse could still terminate innocent lives.""A few lessons stand out:1. Unchecked power corrupts people and nations2. The power of an ideology or worldview does not terminate with the death of a given leader3. Never underestimate the power of an atheistic worldview4. Never take freedom for grantedA History of Modern Russia is a terrific overview. It honestly assesses the strengths and weaknesses of this fascinating country."
5,Best Perlman Collection,"Hi,I think this is a very nice Perlman collection...Beautiful works selected from different Musical Eras and different styles...And Mr. Perlman is very succesful in all these types of masterworks...you can easily feel the Bach's crying words...Mozart's fun...Brahms's passion...Sinding's virtuosity...Wienlawski's Romantism...Khachaturian's hurry...and Rachmaninov's sentiments....and many others...and also Israeli Orchestra did a very good job on this performance...They are like the third hand of Perlman...They work and feel like a family...If you are a Perlman Fan, you must have been already bought this CD...if you are not or new to this performer it is time to meet him..and it is the way to meet him...go!!!"
4,Worth the money,"I recently purchased the Playhut Ultimate Playland and it was well worth the money. I have seen other sets that cost half the price but they do not give you nearly the same amount of pieces that this set gives you. It is easy to set up and you can set it up hundreds of different ways so it will work well in any size space you have. I recently used it at a party that had 18 kids aged 2-7. There were times where 10 kids were using it at once and it didnt seem like it was too crowded. The only issues I have with this product is it is a little flimsy (but durable), I am still trying to figure out what one or two pieces are for and trying to fold it back up to its original size is really hard but it will make everyone that watches you try to fold it up have a good laugh! I would definitely recomend this product."
2,Boring...hardly any action...and a big no in the fun department,"I bought this DVD because Amy Jo Johnsen is in it. (One of my favorite actresses.) What I expected was a decent vampire movie, with some blood and guts, and a good storyline. What I got was a movie with TALKING, TALKING and more talking, and a boring storyline. I saw hardly any action, hardly any fun, and hardly anything interesting. I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki's ex. It was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations, and useless talking.If you are looking for a movie with some action and fun, look elsewhere.As much as I hate to put an Amy Jo movie down, I am doing so."
1,Expensive and not reliable,"Because it cost so much, I expected this thing to last, but it is junk and not reliable. I bought this unit 3 years ago. I live in the Northeast, so I only use the until about 4 months a year. As I understand, the Mosquito Magnet company invented this technology, but they certainly did not perfect it. Reliability is poor. Worked great the first year, caught lots of mosquitoes, and really reduced the number in my yard. The second summer, it started getting temperamental, took a long time to warm up, and seemed to burn more propane. Cleaning the unit with the CO2 cartridges did not help. This summer, it takes many, many tries to get it started up (6-10). I suspect it is about to die. I paid almost $500 and I only use it 4 months a year. For $500, I expect it to work right for more then one summer."
5,How to enjoy your backyard,"I purchased my unit 3 years ago. I has done just what it advertised to do and captures flying insects like mosquitos. I remember getting bitten in the early spring and decided to do something about this situation. Within a few days of using the unit I didn't get bitten once. This year I had some problems getting the unit to start. The technical support, after a moderate wait on the telephone, was pleasant and helpful. The woman walked me through some simple steps and my unit worked flawlessly for the rest of the season."
2,"Works a bit, but worth [$]","My title pretty much says it all. Yes it does attract, but it does not catch very well. I have seen mosquitoes fly in then out of it, so I have my doubts. For three weeks, I have been catching maybe 10 a day. Last night coupled with a electric bug zapper placed right in the CO2s flow, my catch was more than tripled. Like I said, it works a bit, but for[$]I'm going to try something else. After 3 more weeks, I returned it. Sure it caught some, but after a month of no rain and then a week of rain, the bugs were nearly as plentiful as ever. The bug zapper on further review attracted too many helpful bugs to make it appropriate. If I had money to throw away, I might keep it just for the little help it provided, but not at it's price and operating cost."
1,Expensive junk,A total piece of expensive junk. The company repair support is terrible and they should be investigated (...). I'm very sorry I spent my money on such a poor product and I'm stuck with useless junk. Amazon should not sell them.
1,Terrible Quality,I bought the top of the line Mosquito Magnet Pro back around 2002. It never worked for a full summer. It would work for a while then quit. I had it replaced numerous times then was told they would not replace it anymore even though it kept breaking down. The last replacement I got didn't work from the time I took it out of the box. Needless to say I stopped using them. I figured they are a new product and the company has to work the bugs out before they would reliable. That was a few years ago. This year the mosquitoes are terrible and I thought maybe I'd look into buying a new Mosquito Magnet. Surely they have gotten better over the years. I'm sorry to read that they are having the same quality and customer service problems now that they had in the beginning. I would stay clear of this product. The company hasn't learned a thing about quality and customer service in the past years. That's a very bad sign.
1,A waste of money,"Without going into the details, this unit is so touchy that it is essentially useless. It is almost impossible to keep it running. This was a waste of $550."
1,SCAM!!!,"This item is HORRIBLE!!! Putting out your hand would be a better way for catching mosquitos. This item does not work at all! When I wanted to return it, they said I needed the special mix for the south so I bought that thinking I just had the wrong scent in. It still didn't work so I went to return both and they would not accept it..... always a sign they know the product is a piece of junk! This product is a total scam!!!"
1,"Poor quality, poor support, expensive to run","My unit would not start after it's 5th tank of propane, 15 months after purchase - and only 6 months of running time - and 3 months after warranty expired.Contacted technical support, but none of their recommendations worked. Only service option is a $500 power pack replacement, with a 6 month warranty. I would not spend another dollar on this piece of junk. It catches mosquitoes, but certainly will not cover the claimed area. It probably cost me $10 for every mosquito I killed. Definitey NOT recommended. Do NOT Buy."
5,helps a great deal,we've been very pleased with ours. it seems to take the edge off. i am usually the mosquito bait for everyone else and cannot stand being outside. the MML has greatly reduced the mosquito population. some pointers 1) use octenol 2) start early in the season.the biggest difficulty (and not particular to MML) is that the safety valve is a little too safe- i need to typically grab a tank off of my grill that is not so full.
2,really cheap binding and paper,"Just got the book. Its really cheaply made. Very thin wrinkly flimsy paper and the binding is kind of kinked. I never would have purchased from a bookstore in this condition. I should return it, but it's a hassle to do that. What I will do is avoid any other books from this publisher. My advice is don't buy it in this format. Amazon, don't ship out flimsy books like this.I skimmed through the text and it seems ok. I will post an actual review of the text later."
3,Latin American History in very fine print,"The history is concise but extremely difficult to read due to its very small print. This book has been assigned as the primary reading source for UIL academic contest in Texas, but I feel many will choose to not do the contest due to the book's lengthy passages. Several chapters feel like they take forever to finish, and its 700+ pages are very intimidating to teenage readers. Producing a larger version in print and size would help its readability. I did fine myself caught up in its history telling where some passages will inspire the reader to learn even more about the subject."
3,Hard read,Required for UIL contest. None of my students truely enjoyed the book. Was hard to write the required essay after reading it.
1,Caveat emptor,"I was very disappointed with this book. The main problem is the Devanagari script is so small that it is barely legible, especially for a beginner. Strangely, the current edition has hand-written corrections in the margins! This book must have been quite an improvement on Lanman and Whitney when it was first published in the 1940s (?), but there are many better Sanskrit introductions available now, for example Egenes. This book is of no use to me. I have put it away on a very high shelf."
4,Visionary science fiction to expand the imagination,"I'd never heard of Cordwainer Smith; he was referenced in Philip K. Dick's Exegesis, and I decided to give him a try.The stories - all set over the course of one vast future history - and incredible. I've read nothing else quite like them. Smith's vision is truly amazing. I often find myself thinking, as a writer, that I wish I'd had some of these ideas.Why only 4 stars? I find Smith's style a bit choppy in places. But it's a minor point on an absolutely great collection of rare science fiction.If you read nothing else, it's worth the price for Scanners Live in Vain."
2,Expected More from a Pulitzer Prize Winner,"I read this book since it had been selected by my book club. It sounded interesting: the story of a man whose family background tells him he could have, should have been more than a grocery clerk and how a moral man reacts when presented with not-so-moral opportunity in a seemingly corrupt world.I was expecting a story that would grab and hold my attention. While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending. I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that when I reached the last page on my Kindle I had to go back and see if I'd missed something. It was not only abrupt but Ethan's actions seemed out of character."
2,Not one of his best,"I very much enjoy John Steinbeck's novels. This one disappointed me somewhat, I couldn't get into the main character, maybe too American for me to understand and feel comfortable with. I will go back to it at a later date."
5,An All Time Favorite,I probably would not have picked this book to read on my own. I was assigned it in an English Literature class at Santa Monica College. I loved it. It is timeless piece of literature. I give this book as a gift to anyone who has ever paid a fortune teller. It is a perfect example of how a seed can be planted. I give it 10+++++++++++++++.
3,"It's not great, but it's not too bad....","...once you get past the fact that NOBODY sings like Jonathan Davis. The music is good and the various interpretations of Korn's hits are pretty close to the mark. Much more so than the ""Industrial Tribute To Korn"" album released a few years back. The vocals however, leave a lot to be desired. ""Hollow Life"" from Arch Angel is about as close to the real Korn that you're gonna get vocal-wise. And I really like Hardattak's versions of ""Freak On A Leash"" and ""Got The Life"". Maybe I'm spoiled by Jonathan Davis's vocal-stylings or maybe I'm sexist, but the worst cuts (""Blind"",""Good God"" and ""No Place To Hide"")are also the ones with female vocalists. Nothing against the ladies, but it just doesn't work here. All in all, it's a decent album and I would recommend it only to the open-minded looking for a new interpretation of the world's greatest rock band!"
5,Captivatingly written and convincingly researched.,"It is difficult to imagine a book on Rimbaud (or anyone else, for that matter) which contains more detail than this one. In addition, it is very readable and is definitely ""unputdownable"". The reader follows Rimbaud from his birth place Charleville, through his life in the capitals of Western Europe (Paris, Brussels and London), to his wanderings in Africa and his final return to France.On the downside, while I can well imagine the reason for doing so, I found it a bit disappointing that the poems and letters - which are quoted at length in the book - are not translated into English. I guess this is more a critique of my own ignorance of French than a critique of Starkie's (some would say ""wise"") decision to leave her primary source untranslated and, therefore, uncorrupted.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this youthful visionary."
3,Battery Operated hose reel,THe connection for the hose to the unit is not very easy to do and the grooves seem not to line up as easy as I think it should.
4,At Close Quarters,Gives a very in-depth look at all MTB operations in both the pacific and european areas. At times it read like more of a after action report than an authors opinion.
3,"As good a story as ""They Were Expendable"".",This realrecord of the battles of PT boats in areas of WWII was very informative and showed just how brave all of the men who crewed the Plywood Navy were.
5,Wonderful book!,"Very thought provoking, well written book; sure to change your world view. If only everyone could read this, our world and our relationships would be so much better. Thank you Mr Moritz!"
5,Food for thought....excellent book!,I didn't like the channeled stuff. The rest of the book was excellent. Gave me much to think about.
2,letdown....,"i was expecting a novel which was going to be unique since it was nominated for so many awards but was disappointed. The novel drags on and there is no definite path it takes...i am not sure what message the author was trying to send...the characters were not clearly etched...i thought it was about the struggles of an immigrant girl in london but all it did was ramble..i have to be careful to pick authors based on nominations for ""awards""..."
3,"showed promise, but ultimately overrated","I was excited to read this book when it was selected by my book club, but I found it disappointing. Though Monica Ali is a talented writer who uses words beautifully to capture the mood, look, smell, and emotion of a scene, the book introduced too many concepts and themes that either went nowhere or that were wrapped up much too easily and conveniently. Nazneen is an interesting character whose traditional upbringing and deep faith conflict with some of her life choices (such as her extra-marital affair with a much younger man), but I never felt that the author delved into how the character resolved or worked through those conflicts in any significant way. I found myself bored by the last 100 pages, skimming through the conclusion only to find out what happened, but not really caring one way or the other."
3,Anti-climactic story,"This book was ok. I appreciated the flow of the writing--it was easy to read. I didn't find myself caught up on misplaced words like some other books I've read. However, the main events, or what you would expect to be main events, were poorly executed. There was maybe a page devoted to each ""main event"" with most of the book being devoted to ordinary daily doings. The author would drop the anticlimactic bomb and then move on without spending any time describing the main character's emotions. It was difficult to connect to the story. Also, there were so many things in the book that took place without consequence, so it was almost as if there were no point to inserting the event. The affair elicited no heightened sense of anxiety surrounding the secrecy. It was just flat, like the character's personality."
1,huge disappointment,"The reason I gave this book one star is that it is not possible to give none.Every time I walked into a bookstore for a couple of months I wanted to buy this book, because it was getting very good reviews and the beginning was promising. But once I actually bought it and started reading it, like many other reviewers, I found the story way too slow and boring. At no point did I feel I was actually getting involved in the characters' lives - I simply couldn't care less. After reading the reviews here I'm now definitely going to give up, even though I always finish my books and I regret having spent 10 Euros on a book I didn't even finish - but it just does not seem worth losing any more time."
2,Boring and did not make me care,"For someone who never puts a book down once I have started no matter how little it appeals to me, I did the impossible and gave up reading the rest of Brick Lane when I arrived at 200 pages. The reviews on Monica Ali's book promised so much, but gave so little. A long drawn out book with a few redeeming scenes (when Nazneen's first child was ill in hospital and she and Chanu took turns to keep watch), Brick Lane is tough going. Especially annoying was the gibberish from Nazneen's sister which I assumed was meant to be Bengali expressed in direct transliteration. The characters were neither fascinating nor inspirational nor interesting nor deserving of empathy. Of course if I had plodded on I might have changed my mind, but the point being that it was so un-engaging there was no desire on my part to get to the end of it."
2,A Slow Read,"I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews. I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak. Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance!"
4,"a rich, satisfying read","I read this for a book club and really enjoyed it. it's kind of chick-lit-y and exciting and it moves quickly, yet it's moody and deep and intellectual at the same time. monica ali is a very gifted storyteller. she has an impeccable feel for mood. I gained a fresh understanding for the immigrant experience. my only complaint is that the novel seems to bog down a bit at the end with several long anecdotes about the protagonist's native country of Bangladesh, as though Ali were trying to cram these into the book somewhere."
2,"Good, in a way","I can understand all the hype about the book, but it just didnt have anything to lead up too. After about page 100, it's just repeats of characters actions and stuff, it gets kinda lame. And the muslim group part makes the book sooooo slow, you gotta skim it. But then you can't help but feel pity, the way the author throws emotions about how Nazneen feels is almost real. if the book was only had the first 100 pages it would've been cool, but at then end you're just like, dude, this book blows."
4,Faure: Requiem Daniel Barenboim,The Barenboim directed rendition of Faure's Requiem is slow and ponderous. I urge anyone who is interested in this magnificent music to obtain the recording of John Rutter. I have several versions of the Requiem but none match the Rutter performance.The balance of this CD is fine.
1,Great for 1 season. Plan to buy a new one each year.,"These are great for one season. After that, you will continue to PAY them to ""fix"" it, which amount to it working for another week or two. If you want one, save your sanity and plan to buy a new one annually. The service companies need to be served with a class action suit."
2,Works great if it works,"I used this for one season. Unlike most of the people who have trouble restarting it, mine is an electrical problem with the unit. The light doesn't flash and the fan doesn't go on. Tested the voltage at the plug and it's fine... so the problem must be with the unit itself. I just wish they could make a reliable version of this thing. It's great that it is made in the US, but I buy a lot of generic stuff made in China that is more reliable."
1,Zero Stars. DOA Year 2,Will not start in Spring start-up. 8 units in 8 years! Buy for 1 season's use; you won't get a second. Trying the Nosquito Mosquito vacuum this year.
1,Not worth it,"The product captured a few mosquitoes for 3 weeks after I tried to switch out the tank, it failed to work. After multiple phone calls with tech support I was told I need original receipt from purchase (I could not locate it) to have it serviced. Returned the item to Home Depot for in store credit and bought some candles and mosquito repellent. It doesn't work and it's not worth the hassle trying to fix it. Maybe the company can redesign it to have better results."
1,Don't waste your money like I did,"have owned the defender unit for years - has never worked right. tried it again this year, hoping against hope, that it might work . . . nothing. used quick clear cartridges, reset tool, et al . . . just won't stay on. continue to get the mysterious fast blinking light. a total (and I mean TOTAL) waste of time and money. find another solution."
1,Fooled again,"I bought my first Mosquito Magnet several years ago. They no longer sell or service that model called the industrial model. It worked reasonably well but had start up problems. I sent it back for power head repairs three times. Last year I purchased a Liberty model and had to also send it back twice within a year for repair. It has stopped working again and it is no longer under warranty. The long and short of it is these things only work for about a year. They do catch mosquitoes but have a design flaw. They flat out do not last. I live in the Florida Keys and if they worked and held up I would have them all over my property. However, I would have to have a full time repairperson on the payroll."
3,so so,The mosquito magnet defender is wonderful when it works. Mine lasted 2 seasons and I then traded it in on a repaired unit at a licensed dealer. This one only lasted one season. So frustrating as it does eliminate mosquitos when working but you can spend a lot of money clearing the valve only to not solve the problem.
1,"Sort of works, lasted one season","I bought a Mosquito Magnet from Amazon last year. Caught quite a few mosquitoes, so I was happy. This year, I can't get the thing to transition from start-up to operation (orange to green LED). I've cleaned everything, checked that the thermistor works, etc. I can see that the catalytic converter is getting hot, but still no dice. Hopeless product, stay away from it."
1,Good for one year only.,"This is the trap available at my local hardware. Mine worked fantastically the first year. Second year, inadequate. I attempted to repair it but found no customer support. A dealer in Florida sent me a refurbished head - still inadequate. I bought another new one two years ago and it worked great for one year. Don't buy this lemon unless you want to spend $75 a month controlling mosquitoes."
5,mosquito magnet defender,"This thing really works, it caught about 50 mosquitos and 150 no see ums in the 1st day.I had a lentek eco trap which only caught 2 mosquitos in about 6 days-sent it back."
5,I can enjoy my backyard now!,"I bought this Mosquito Defender yesterday at Home Depot on sale for $190 and placed it in my backyard...I haven't checked the filter to see how many the Defender has caught, but what matters to me is that I haven't got bitten since and can enjoy being in the backyard now. I do get bitten in the frontyard as soon as I step out of the door, so that's how I was able to tell that the Defender in the backyard is really doing its job.I strongly recommend this product!"
1,Breaks after 2 years!,"Yes, it works but breaks after 2 to 3 years. The service center we brought it to confirmed this. They have a ""whole pile"" of Mosquito Magnets to repair and are waiting for parts from the company. They knew exactly what was wrong with ours and told us that this is ""standard"".Beware."
4,"Catches mosquitoes, but you'll still get bit","We have owned the Mosquito Magnet for one Houston summer, and it has caught hundreds of mosquitoes, especially Asian tiger fly mosquitoes. It doesn't seem to catch no-see-ums as well, even with OCT-3. Our backyard is about 2,500 sq ft, mostly lawn, and the Defender performs adequately. The latest attractant, OCT-3, really makes a difference compared with the old versions. Don't get lazy about cleaning the propane nozzle with the carbon charger before you refill the propane tank; otherwise, it takes forever to start the machine. The Mosquito Magnet takes some patience and investment in accessories, but we feel that it has made our backyard a bit more bearable. Keep buying the bug spray, though!"
5,Traces of Wisdon,This is a excellant read. She is very clear and the stories she tells are wonderful. Would highly recommend.
2,cute but thats it,"this toy is very cute, the music and sounds are great and I love that it spins (though mine is broken and no longer spins now that we are on baby #2) I don't think it is very durable as a toy, it is better to be admired on a shelf. The pictures don't project onto the wall very good unless the unit is right by the wall. I wouldn't recomment this toy."
4,"Wonderful, fantastic, full of knowledge","This is a great book. It is full of helpful hints for any youth worker or youth pastor. I loved reading this book because it was so helpful in giving ideas and helpful stragedies to work with teenagers in different settings. I would stronlgy recommend this book to anyone who was thinking about working with youth. Also, this book contains helpful information if you wanted to start a youth ministry of your own."
5,True,"One book, that if you understand it (in your mind and heart) will change your life for the whole eternity."
2,A COLORING BOOK,"This is merely a coloring book of Mucha's work. The book safely describes it as ""rendered in crisp black and white,"" which is just black lined renditions of Mucha's work. I bought this blindy on the net and mistook it for another book with a similar name. END"
2,Boring,This movie starts out slow and never gets any faster. The only reason I watched this movie is because my granddaughter had a bit part in it.
3,a bit unrealistic,"I found this book to be inspirational but unrealistic - unless you are a type ""a"" workaholic""- then it's o.k. I bought this book several years ago and have read it a couple of times and the impression I get every time - compulsive, obsessive and unrealistic"
1,Vague and condescending,"Unlike Don Aslett's other books, this one is short on specific advice. Worse yet, his tone is condescending throughout, implying that those who don't live according to his rules are worthless slugs. What you get is a preachy book full of useless and vague platitudes like ""Productive people do more work!"" (Duh!) He also advises questionable strategies such as getting less sleep and working in spite of illness. I found the book offensive and a complete waste of money and bookshelf space."
1,The Title is Wishful Thinking,"Struggling with drawing the human figure and looking for easy answers I was suckered into buying this book by the positive reviews. It's one of the weakest drawing instructionals I've ever seen. It's style is heroic comic book. That's not bad in itself, as you can learn a lot of proportion and foreshortening from good line art. The problem, besides poor drawing, is the lessons(?) go something like this: draw a circle, now divide that into thirds and ""poof"", here's the finished drawing! No real instruction, no real system. I found this book useless and even embarrassing to have on the bookshelf. There is no easy answer to drawing the human figure except drawing the human figure and learning from your mistakes. Don't bother with this book, there are better instructions out there."
5,The title says it all,I have read many books about drawing human anatomy and as the author states they are dry and complicated. I was caught in a rut and this book brought me out of it. I especially was impressed with the focus on drawing the face and the focus on the various muscles when drawing a full body sketch. Go out and get this book. You can't go wrong.
1,For non-discerning children,"This guy is a one-note player! Oversimplified with too much of the artist's own personal style injected into it. It's a starter book, for goodness' sake, so there must be a bit more impartiality to the drawings to get the basics down! In addition, there are certain rules to drawing humans that are missed in this book. This guy is cutting artistic corners all over the place, drawing symbolically and not literally. It's on the level of bad 1990's cartoons. Come on! I was robbed (well, for a couple nights until I returned it)."
5,A child pleaser!,One in a series of board books that take Elmo through a number of varying adventures while he looks for the little lost black doggy. My kids and my nieces and nephews love these and it's a shame they were discontinued!
3,"""Squeal Like a Pig!!!""","I have owned this movie for the past two years, and I finally watched it a few days ago. It's not bad. It has classic actors such as Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, and Ned Beatty. Four friends wanna take a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River over the weekend. Their little vacation soon becomes a nightmare when Ed and Bobby run into some hillbillies that torture and rape them. Their trip becomes worse when they reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. If you love hillbillies, rednecks, and man-rape, you'll love DELIVERANCE!!!"
2,overall a very average movie,I remember reading the book years ago and finding it to be pretty thrilling. I can't say as I found the same in the movie. There were some suspenseful moments but overall a great amount of tedium. The characters were strongly lacking in anything of interest most especially that portrayed by Burt Reynolds. The scenery on the other hand was fantastic. Best I can say for this one is I managed to stay awake the entire time it was on.
2,The concept is good but the movie is slow and boring.,I actually bought this movie from amazon. I thought that it would be good. I had seen it a long time ago and i couldn't remember if I liked it or not. I should have never bought it. It is just so boring. The movie is extremely slow.
4,Funny movie,"This is a classic, I have always wanted to watch this movie. It was very funny in some parts and tense in others. Overall a very good movie to watch."
2,Deliverance is just alright,"I can understand how people mistake ""Deliverance"" for a classic. Undeniabley, there are a few memorable scenes (including the ""Dueling Banjos"" and the ""Sqeal like a pig"" scenes), and the director does build up an adequit amount of tension. But all in all, this homoerotic macho adventure/thriller is long, anti-climatic and at times intolerabley dull. Really not that scary, and the good ideas are not followed through on as well as they should have been. The book is much better."
4,Good. Creepy.,Scary stuff. Stay away from the hill people. The dueling banjos scene at the start of the early in the movie is one of the creepiest things ever.
3,"dont go on a canoe trip, because if you do, they rape you","filled with some great camera work, lots of grunting and groping and those damn reneck rapers. squeal piggy!!!! some great moments but it gets a little headaching but I can see why the critics liked it but I thought it was an ok movie. if you can stand the grunting, groping and the raping then your fine and the boy with the banjo is freaky. when you hear that banjo play, run the hell out"
4,"bad production,but...","it's pretty good.nothing too spectacular here,but onions(aka choptop)livens it up and there are mostly good songs.it's just that the cd needs a remaster badly."
3,Blues Brothers 2000 Sings the Blues... Literally!!,"Like Ghostbusters II came 5 years too late, Blues Brothers 2000 came 20 years too late. It doesn't capture the spirit of the 1979 original at all. Even with all the added characters and a guest stars in this movie, it was very hard to watch and follow.John Goodman and Joe Morton signed on to this bad script and bad direction. It's nice to see Dan Aykroyed and the rest of the BB Band together and performing again, but they don't seem like they're having any fun at all. However, The Blues Bros. 2000 CD soundtrack is great from beginning to end which is why it deserves three stars instead of two."
2,Thank goodness for DVD chapter jumps,"Most of this movie is virtually unwatchable. Of the 41 chapters on the DVD, there are 5, and that includes the closing credits, that'd I'd want to see again, all excellent musical numbers. A movie can't be all bad that has Eric Clapton and B.B. King on guitar.On the other hand, a movie can't be called good that has a plot that defines contrived, 4 real actors in a cast of dozens, indifferent cinematography, lazy direction, and John Goodman in the place of John Belushi. It is an insult to the memory of the hallowed original that this movie was released."
2,"Sad, really.","You know that guy you know who keeps telling the same joke over and over again because he either forgot he already told you, or he doesn't realize how it loses its charm after each re-telling? Imagine he has a multi-million dollar budget to make a movie because he told a funny joke 20 years ago.That's the Blues Brothers 2000.This movie seems to have been made for no other reason than to bolster Dan Aykroyd's insistent, sad delusion that he's a blues singer, and to make a soundtrack with a bunch of legendary musicians. Noble aims, poor outcome."
3,not all bad,"If nothing else, you gotta love the music. You just can't have the Blues Brothers without John Belushi."
2,I Had The Blues Watching This One,"Just not the same. . .with Belushi gone, and Goodman trying to be a substitute. Even the Queen of Soul couldn't top the performance she gave in the earlier film. Some laughs, but very little of the magic. There was a gag about how Elwood parks his car that was done too many times; it was funnier in the first film. And what was up with adding a kid to the mix? The surprise for me was hearing Joe Morton sing. He's actually pretty good! If you do watch this one, stick around after the end credits to catch a performance by James Brown (who's STILL the man, by the way)."
1,Bland,a very bad film is the best way to sum up this mess.nothing works at all.what seemed cool 20 years back is at best a Spoof.the music is so-so at best.skip it.
1,garbage,"the lowest possible star review is a ""one""...this movie deserves a ""zero"" star review...garbage garbage and garbage...did i forget to mention this movie is garbage."
1,A telling fact about Amazon reader reviews,"The fact that this has an aggregate three stars tells one a lot about reviews here.This is one of the worst major motion pictures ever made,on a short list with Caddyshack 2,Highlander 2,and Attack of the Clones,among others,and yet there are still people here giving it good reviews and five stars.An important fact to remember is that *any* movie on Amazon which has three and a half stars or less average is the absolute lowest swill to come out of the hollywood machine.Three stars here is equivalent to about 15% on some absolute rating scale.That said,this movie is a horrible ripoff,and a shining example of how artless and philistine hollywood can be,and how important the almighty buck is to many in the film business.This piece of crap exists for no other reason than for the fact that some executive thought it would make a profit.One star is giving it far,far too much credit."
3,What's missing,"Great music, lots of star power and a good deal of nostalgia went into this movie. The only real problem is--there's no John Belushi. Without him, half of the Blues Brothers soul is gone."
1,John Belushi is spinning in his grave!,"If you loved the first film, because it was so much more than just another slapstick, you'll hate this for exactly the same reason. Yes its more of the same, because its entirely unoriginal, but most people understand that because something is funny the first time doesnt ensure it will be funny when copied! The plot is weak, no I take it back I caould'nt really comment on the plot, I could'nt find one! The only slim consolation is that at least I wont be around for Blues Brothers 3000!"
1,Terrible. Why can't I give it 0 stars?,"There are very few movies that I've ever wanted to walk out of. This one jumped to the top of the list. This movie deserves recognition for not only being one of the worse sequels ever, but one of the worse movies. It's painful to sit through. This movie should be punishment for shop lifting."
3,Why such wimpy climaxes - is it just me?,"Versions like DePreist play so soft in first movement, one wants to crank up volume. Then for climaxes volume must be turned back down. This Stokowski recording is just the opposite. The 1st movement is much louder than any other version, & should actually be cut back on volume. But when climaxes come, WHERE ARE THEY. It almost seems like the supposed soft passages are louder than the climaxes. Regardless of the gorgeous playing, this volume anomaly just jumps out at me. Totally out of balance as far as I am concerned. I don't understand about all the raves in other reviews, and this not mentioned. I love this symphony and have 6 versions, so it's not like I have no point of reference. You will hear it ALL in glorious sound with Haitink, Berglund, and others, but if you like to hear the power when it's written in the music, it's just not here in this version."
3,just so much horse manu,"A MUST READ! Uh - no it isn't. A GREAT BOOK! Uh - far from it. THE MOST IMPORTANT > IN 30 YEARS! Uh - probably the only book the guy read in 30 years._ (or Crist bought him a dinner to write that).I'm only unhappy with the book because it teaches most horse players - little to nothing. FAR better explanations of trifecta's and pick 4's are available by google or AOL searches. What I did like about it was seeing/reading Steve Crist trying to make himself important. He is important to racing; just not in book form. Need to know about the pick 6 or a daily double. Sorry, not here. If I seem negative, it's only because this should have been a much better book."
1,Poor wood quality,"I bought this bat for my son, He plays for a American Legion Team and they only use wood bats. This bat broke in the third game under normal use. Contacted Mizuno and they said too bad!"
4,great bible for general use,"This is a great bible for general use. It has plenty of space for taking notes. I have started writing down questions that arise as I read to be answered later. The size is not to big, unlike most wide margin bibles that are huge. I like the red letter for Christ's spoken words. If there was a NASB version it would be the perfect bible."
3,Black and White Alert!,"I was hoping this might be one of those ""restored and colorized"" DVD's, but alas, it's in black and white and very grainy. Each show does get a little better though and the third one from 1966 is almost good. But my 96-Year-Old mother, whom I bought it for, doesn't seem to mind, or even notice! So there you have it, the quality of the production is purely in the eye of the beholder. I'm glad I bought it for her because she LOVES it! Likes in particular seeing all the children of the bandmembers and performers at the end of each show."
2,Lawerence Welk Christmas Shows,I realize that this is the 1950's shows but the quality of the picture was very poor. I knew it was going to be black and white but it was pretty dark that you could not make out who the person was.
4,Special folks here,"Well, sure enough this is NOT the Lawrence Welk Show but the 'Plymouth' Show featuring Lawrence Welk and his company of folks. Of course unless you are into advertising - Otherwise, this IS the Lawrence Welk Show where a singular commercial displays the GREAT BIG fins of the '59 Plymouth.And special performers.... The Lennon Sisters and - Surprise - Cubby O'Brien from the Mickey Mouse Club. Now everyone knows that Bobby (the oldest of the Mouskeeters) beacme a featured dancer for the program but did we realize that Cubby was also featured?Now lessseeeeee.....mmmmm Janet Lennon was 12 in the first of these programs as was Cubby. Cubby was one of only 9 mouskeeters to survive all three Mickey Mouse Club seasons - Autumns an' winters of '55 thru '58......... So this program musta been done just AFTER the Disney contract was over. Could THIS have been Cubby's Lawrence Welk Show Debut?Looks like a subject for further research - Noah 8-?"
2,Not what I expected,"I assumed, (foolishly), that the three shows were picked for this DVD for a specific reason. The first show was pretty good. The second show simply rehashed many of the songs of the first. The third show, recorded 8 years after the 1958 airing, was just as redundant, with the exception of it being in color, and many of the band members now donning gray hair.Ho Hum"
5,Great shoes and great price.,"My 2 year old daughter is just starting dance and these shoes are perfect for her. She thinks that she is just it with her new shoes. The fit is great.I found these shoes originally on Amazon, however I actually ordered then from Discount Dance Supply. The shoes are the smae price however the shipping was 1/2 the price. The service from them was fantastic. Within 2 hours of placing my order, it was shipped and I received my order within 5 days. www.discountdancesupply.com"
3,A decent book but could have told more about the company,Hewlett Packard is a now disgraced company that has severe problems to face in the future but this book will take you back to the HP of old. It tells how a printer company was developed to fill a need and the way in which they did business. I am normally not a fan of these books (The .... Way) but this one did a good job. It is short and to the point filling in the gap of an interesting company. It is worth a quick glance over if you are interested in the tech industry to see how a company should be run.
2,plantation,i am a huge dorothea fan but this is the one book of hers i would not recommend...the characters are not even likeable...a big disappointmet from a normally top notch author
2,BLAH!!,"I can't help but wonder if the previous readers and I read the same book. I am not a southerner but have enjoyed reading books about the South. However, I just could not get into this one. The character of Miss Lavinia was the only interesting part of the book. The rest of the characters were just plain BLAH. Maybe Ms. Benton should try writing about another section of the country."
5,Tugs at your heart!,"What a great book! I thoroughly enjoyed the read. Never heard of DBF before now. She has been added to my favorite authors. Read this book during a recent visit to Myrtle Beach, SC. How convenient!It was an easy read and easy to identify with each character. My only disappointment was that the story ended. I read LowCountry Summer first and glad I did. It says alot about the author when you can read book two before reading book 1 and still get the whole picture. Dorothea Benton Frank is a great story teller! Look forward to reading all of her books."
3,My review,This is not a favorite author of mine. I usually read Anne RiversSidddons on the lowcountry fiction and this author doesn't measure up to her.
5,"Minnie Mouse 10"" Trike",I just love this trike. The picture on-line does no justice for this product. If you want to buy something very unique for your little princess this is the perfect trike. My daughter just loves it as much as anyone that sees her ride it.
1,DO NOT purchase this in electronic form!,"So. I read the Little Lisper a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. I finally got around to buying this book last night for my new Kindle. BIG mistake. It is unreadable. The font size can only be changed for the preface, acknowledgements and contents overview. The actual meat of the book CANNOT be altered with any settings on the Kindle. It's not a PDF so I can't zoom and the font is soooo small (about a millimeter high) it is unreadable even with 20/15 vision!I wish I could actually comment on the book itself...Buy the dead tree version."
3,"Product good, lid defective","I've been happy with other Nature's Answer essences, but this one arrived with a defective lid - half stuck to the bottle, which usually indicates an old product. So my reaction to this product is not a positive one!"
5,Great film,"Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman all at the top of their game. A great supporting cast. Enough said. See it."
4,Amazing Story!!,"This is a fantastic movie...The story of a loner of a hitman getting involved and caring for a hunted, unloved and surviving child of a murdered family. You will be sitting on the edge of your sofa, overwhelmed by the violence (worth every bit of it) to see Natalie Portman in her very first picture...Murder, charm, humor, crime, sensitivity, survival and love all together in one remarkable tale..."
5,The Professional,Great movie. DVD was in perfect condition from the seller. I would purchase again from this dealer.
2,Preposterous Story,"Not even a beautiful and talented child (Natalie Portman) could save this preposterous story. It amazes me that anyone could take this film seriously, especially Oldman's over the top performance as a narcotics officer. Put this in the category of Urban Fantasy. Portman fans should take a look at Beautiful Girls, a small movie that she stole a couple of years later."
4,Leon review,"Leon is one of my favorite films. It is a two person play in which one character saves the other and in the process is redeemed himself. It is about violent lives in which there seems to be no way out or up. Regardless, by the end of the story, they find love and hope.Far from a standard love story, and far from the standard story of redemption, Leon ends at what is possibly the best point for each."
3,There's a lot missing here...,"The Professional is that rarest of films: a good action flick. Luc Besson's direction, and Natalie Portman's performance (no wonder she caught the eye of George Lucas) are absolutely first-rate. But the film seemed choppy. Characters seemed to interact in a way that seemed as if they knew more about each other than had been portrayed in the film.However, it makes sense, when you realize that the European version is substantially longer (by about an hour I think). I would have enjoyed seeing the somewhat ambiguous relationship between Mathilda and Leon develop more. This is a good American version of what I am sure was a great European film. I understand the Hollywood mentality of keeping every film under 2 hours (unless it's directed by Kevin Costner or Steven Spielberg), but when you release something on DVD, you should release ALL of it.Shame on you, DVD-makin' folks. We demand more!"
4,"Compellingly Written, Directed, and Delivered","Growing up in New York City is never simple, even for the most privileged of adolescents. And the age of twelve is arguably the most impressionable period for a youngster. So when a young girl witnesses something exceptionally brutal, adolescence may evaporate just as the early morning dew. This is a slice of the dilemma that `Mathilda' (Natalie Portman) inherits in this film. ""Leon,"" the title character played by Jean Reno, inherits Mathilda and the dilemma. Portman delivers a performance of circumstance well beyond her years with style, savvy, and intelligence. The powers that be could have easily entitled this one ""Mathilda,"" because she creates the dynamics of the story, and adds a pleasant wrinkle to the neo-noir genre. However, it must be duly noted that Jean Reno renders a creative and daring portrayal of a heartless assassin who slips to care."
5,Don't waste your time on the US version--watch THIS!,"This movie was such the victim of US censors...deciding what is, and is not appropriate for the viewers.If you are eight years old; you shouldn't be watching this movie in the first place, if you are an adult; this is the version you want.Great story, great acting, great directing--this is a movie that shows WHY movies are made.Don't believe me? Rent it first, then spend your money to own this incredible flick."
5,One of the Few Suspense Films w/ Unique Characters and Plot,"The Professional is a movie about a hit man named Leon who takes a little girl under his wing after her entire family is murdered. Leon (played by Jean Reno) is an amazingly complex character. He has a good heart, and refuses to kill women or children under any circumstances. The little girl makes Leon's life much more fun, but also puts him in grave danger when she decides to avenge her family's death. I loved this movie because the characters were so realistic, and yet so unordinary. You'll be surprised to see yourself loving and respecting someone who kills for a living."
4,Contract Killer w/a Heart,This movie has a good undertone to it about a hitman who takes in a girl who is recently orphaned. Entertaining and overall nice to watch.
4,Great movie except...,I wanted a more cleaner ending and better explanation of how the police is involved. It left me with an unsatifsying feeling.
3,No Cardboard Sleeve Included!,"One of the parts of this movie is how awesome the cover art is. When I ordered it from Amazon I assumed that it would come with the movie. When I received it there was no cover sleeve which for me is a big thing so I was disappointed plus the discs were knocked loose, better off just buying it somewhere else."
3,Didn't know I'd be buying (lightly) used...,"I got the DVD in an orange bubble-envelope, securely taped shut and appropriately sized, but the DVD case itself was coated in a cracked plastic heat-wrap, and the disc wasn't secured to the inside of the case, and had some smudges on the Widescreen side. Just got it today, haven't seen if it will play, but I don't doubt it will."
1,Not very good,"I can't believe the high reviews this film received. I'm a fan of both Reno and Danny Aiello but this film from the ridiculous beginning until I had to turn it off midway through was horrible.The meeting between Reno and Aiello at the beginning was childish; and the action sequnces where Reno acts like Spiderman and kills a good half dozen armed thugs was ludicrous.This film couldn't make up its mind as to whether it was a spoof of gangsters, or out and out sci-fi.Save yourself the time and money."
3,you get what you pay for,Got this box for my wife to keep a few tools at work. Its small so it fit well in her desk drawer. It is what it is. Not very well made at all evan for a cheap box. My biggest complaint is the latch will not stay closed without putting a lock or something through it to hold it shut. Theres no modifying the latch to work better. its just poorly designed. To top it all of it came damaged. It should have been packed better. it was just put inside a cardboard box and shipped. Hope the manufactures read this and work on improving it. It COULD be a nice little box
1,THE BOOK IS REDUNDANT AND VERY BORING.. USE BOOK IN CLASS...,THE BOOK IS VERY BORING AND NOT GOOD READING MATERIAL. I AM READING THE BOOK FOR A UNIVERSITY CLASS AND DISLIKE THE READING ALTOGETHER. THE AUTHOR NEED TO TO TRY TO DO AN UPDATED AND MORE INTERESTING VERSION OF THE HISTORY. HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND THE WEST INDIES AND VISIT THE SITE IF I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK... VERY VERY DULL!!!!!!
3,An Average Anthology,"In this uneven boudoir romance novella, maestro Bertrice Small easily outshines with her unconventional tale ""Zuleika and the Barbarian"" with its exotic Arabic setting. The tale excites with delicious cunning, pageantry and sorcery with Zuleika the Princess of Dariyabar outwitting his cousin Haroun to regain her hold of the throne. She strikes a bargain with her betrothed Amir Khan and with the aid of her genie Kansbar, she has to fend herself from the evil plots of the wicked harem mistress. Thea Devine and Jane Bonander choose a safer route with mediocre romances. ""All the Secret Pleasure"" by Devine is a tale that sees Simon Charlesworth convincing worldy widow Corinna Woodholme that she is to be his only choice in marriage; Bonander's simple tale is an encounter of love sparks between bachelor Ross Benedict and feisty Lily Charlesworth whose trust had been misplaced by her ex. Save for Bertrice Small's tale, this anthology is largely diluted and unexciting."
2,Mediocre,"Bertrice Small manages to save this book with her story, but just barely. Certainly not Small's best work and the whole ""genie"" thing was really out there. Thea Devine and Bonander stories were completely uninteresting, not only the plot and the characters, but the sex scenes as well. Is anyone else convinced that Devine is a male? No woman uses words found in ""her"" writing. I awarded this book 2 stars only because of Small. In the future, I will avoid Devine's work at all costs."
2,Technical Error!,"I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this! You can see from the cover photo that the sun is shinning on the mountains from the left side, but on the tree in the foreground it is shinning from, the right. This is a huge technical error that I could not imagine any competent artist making. She does not use a reference, obviously, because the sun does not shine from two directions.There also seem to be very rushed in a formula driven manner without any stepping back to reflect and make necessary changes. She says you can paint a good painting quickly in half hour. Maybe she can do her method in that time, but a good painting takes time to reflect and change along the way. In my opinion, she does not take the time to see what she is creating.There are some palette knife techniques to pick up, but I would not buy this video for any other reasons. It could lead a beginner in a wrong direction and has little good information for the experienced painter."
5,So Sweet,"You've got to have a hole in your heart to not like this sweet story of a man, his amazing dog, and a once in a lifetime trip. I wish I could do the same journey with my Maxie, but I don't think she would behave in restuarants as well as Ella! Highly recommended for people who like travel books AND dog books."
2,Is this the same movie as the book?,"First of all, LOVED the book. However, the movie might as well have had a different title. The two plots are so different it isnt even funny. If you're expecting this movie to even look a fraction of what the book was, you'll be sorely misled. However, if you havent read the book, and just watch the movie, you may very well be happy. The movie could stand alone rather well on its own accord, but if you read the book, you're just opening yourself to disappointment. I couldnt wait after I read this book to see the movie. I blinked several times to see if I was hallucinating at this poor copy of the book.I've never been this harsh in a review before, but I was just so disappointed in this movie I had waited through reading the book and waiting for it to come out on HBO, to get this poor excuse of an interpretation."
5,Excellent,"Not a Hugh Grant fan, but this movie was terrific. A real, authentic thriller. Gene Hackman was great as the villain, as usual. While posing a medical ethical conundrum (how do you find cures for diseases without experimenting on humans?), this movie has edge-of-the-seat excitement and was fast paced.I have to admit that I figured out the plot from the first scene, but went along for the ride and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm surprised that only 15 others have reviewed this great film. Watch it - you won't be disappointed."
4,Great but wish it were larger,"I love to cook and though I have a spicerack it's limited in size. I bought two of these to fit in my cabinets and they are pretty good, you have to dig through to find your spice instead of being able to see it altogether, but that's fine with me. I wish they had different sizes (I'd buy the biggest) but for the price you can't be that picky. Would definitely recommend this to someone.I didn't nail mine in btw, I just pull it out of the cupboard and onto my counter when I need it."
4,Classic European History helps assess recent events in Iran,The Paris Commune of 1871 in both its inception and defeat was used by Lenin as an example of how this revolutionary action failed to dismantle the financial and governmental institutions and left them intact and availble for restoration by the existing regime. The recent Iranian protests are not aimed at dimantling the iron bond between Islam and the State but for less autocratic and restrictive secular rule and a better economy. The Republicans call for proactive US meddling in this revolt is in the radical tradtion of the last administrtion and will harm the potentional for internally generated change in Iran by its people and not by the Mullahs definied foreign devil. Republicans need to read a book a book or two like the Paris Commune to temper their radical dreams for Iran which may lead to an unwanted result much as the Hamas victory in the US sponsored Palestine election did not foster peace.
1,A moving tribute to Eurocentrism,"Unfortuntately, the first words of this textbook encourage a Eurocentric view of American history. The textbook from here does a good job of boring the student to death and avoids any attempt at truth, especially until the 1930's. Also, I noticed another glowing error. The grapabo review and the textbook suggests that the Civil War was fought as a states issues. However, Abraham Lincoln and the everyone else in the 1860's on both sides would disagree. Another example of perpetuating the Confederate Myth. I would not recommend this book to any of my classes."
1,Ducane Stainless Steel Heat Plate,The one that I ordered did NOT fit into my Ducane as told... I had to cut some steel off so it would fit...
5,Shampoo without problems,"This product not only produced a cleaner dog, but a better smelling pooch. Ultra White cleans very, very well. Highly recommended!!"
1,The Smell!!!,"It works like my other shampoo but leaves my maltese smelling not so fresh. I had to get rid of it, couldn't stand the smell anymore."
3,Whitening? Really?,"Just because the shampoo is purple, does NOT mean it is whitening. This worked just like any other dog shampoo I've used. My dogs were not any brighter than they normally were after a bath. Of course they seemed whiter, since I washed away all the dirt from their coats - like it ALWAYS does. This is just like any other shampoo. The clincher: I didn't care for the scent at all. That is a personal thing, I know, but if I am going to spend money on something, I want to enjoy using it. I won't be buying this again after I am out of this stuff. There are cheaper options that clean my dogs just as well."
2,"Several errors, disjunct presentation.","Yes, I did check the errata on the website. And today, 2 weeks later, no word from the authors or technical editors. I'm really not impressed. And for the record, I passed W/O this book 846/900.For example, the PNG file format is not limited to 256 colors. In actuality, it supports up to 24bit color and an 8bit alpha channel.Or the fact that Spoofing was not covered in the book at all, nor even listed in the index, yet when I took the i-Net+ there were 3 questions about it.Now, aside from the numerous errors I found, this book is poorly organized. The information is not presented in a logical flow, but a scattered, haphazard manner which makes it extremely difficult for newbies. [In their defense, CompTIA doesn't really organize the domains for the i-Net very logically either.]You'd be better off using just internet resources to study for this exam:"
2,This book is highly NOT recommended!,"I bought this book to self study for the test. There is a LOT of material on the test that is NOT covered in this book. I scored 95% and above on the tests included with the book, and was very confident going to the testing center. However, when I took the test, a LOT of the material came from nowhere, and certainly not from Groth's study guide.I had originally planned to send Mr. Groth an email to thank him for the book. Now my only plan is to email him to advise him to find another means of income other than authoring mis-informing study guides. If you take no other recommendations from Amazon today, please take this one..."
3,"Helpful, but lacking in some areas","The book overall was helpful. Though I did not think the chapters were well organized. The information was helpful in passing the exam, but it was missing information that appeared on the exam. The CD is the best part of the book, but again it lacks some information in the networking area and e-commerce sections. If you are not taking an instructor led course, then the book is worth buying as one resource to use to pass the exam."
5,A great writer and his world,"The fanatical obsessive drive of Balzac to master all human learning, and create or recreate the whole society and world he knew is at the heart of his life and work. Zweig tells the story of Balzac the writer with sympathy and understanding and great narrative strength. The personal life of Balzac is also driven by the passion for possession and Zweig also tells this part of the story in a fascinating way. This is a very good book about a great writer and his world. And like all of Zweig's work once you begin to read it you do not wish to stop until you finish it all."
3,Good story - a bit dated and predictable,"Not the classic we had hoped, this story was undoubtedly a good one in its day but the presentation is dated and the story is now predictable. Still, we enjoyed it"
1,"Painful acting, leaden pace","Too stylized to be enjoyable. Crouse is so wooden that you wish the camera would move away from her and free her up. Mantegna is slightly more enjoyable, but the convincing performances are all from the bit-players. The result -- no tension (how can you care about the leads?), no engagement, and therefore no pay-off. A clunker I can't wait to get rid of."
3,Not bad...not great,"I frankly thought this film was going to be better. I could see the ending coming a mile away, and much of the first half of the film was pretty slow going. The scene of the woman in her office after she ""kills"" the cop is interminable. It just goes on with no point. OK, she's distressed, I get it, I get it. Joe Mantegna is good, as usual, but not phenomenal. Lindsay Crouse is adequate.Some of the lines are real clinkers, like when the author tells Mike ""let's talk turkey."" I mean, who talks like that? William H. Macy was wasted in a dopey scene that was totally unrealistic.Is this Mamet's best? No, no, a thousand times no. Glengarry Glen Ross was far superior entertainment."
2,"Too sloooow, too repetitive","The concept is interesting, but the application falls far short of the mark. The gameplay is very slow on an older machine, and even on 1.6 Pentium is poor. The golf course design applications are vey crude, especially in comparision to the golf architect functions in golf simulations like Jack Nicklaus golf or Tiger Woods. In addition, those products give you the opportunity to play the course.The challenges are very easy provided you have the patience to wait for enough money to come in for building the course, and you don't mind endlessly chasing gophers. This is a poor imitation of good products like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon."
5,One of the best H. Rollins out there.,"If you think you might want to read a H. Rollins book,this is where you'll want to start.Not for the light of hart, or, weak of mind"
2,Disappointedly damaged,"This item arrived damaged. I have returned it. The corners of the front and back covers were cracked and smushed. The twine design on the front was coming unglued. Inner binding seemed too tight and to be the cause of tears in paper lining the inside covers. Some of the strings to hold pictures on the inner pages were too long, not tight enough for their purpose. It is a pretty design, great idea, but the materials seem too delicate for their intended use. I purchased another design at the same time that had one tear inside from the binding. I kept it because it was too late to find another replacement to use as a Christmas gift."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Having read and enjoyed Lescroart's more recent novels featuring Dismas Hardy and Abe Glisky, I went back in search of some of his earlier works. I picked up The Hearing in hopes of getting some vintage Lescroart. I was not disappointed. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Lescroart built his usual compelling, page-turning work. For me though, taking this out of order allowed for Lescroart's introduction of a number of characters that I grew to know in subsequent books. This certainly was an unexpected added dimension and source of enjoyment as I went quickly through the book. As might be expected, Lescroart does a great job of bringing out raw human emotion in the characters in a way that adds complexity and depth to the story. All in all, I'm very glad I went back to The Hearing. It was well worth the time."
3,Not much literary meat,"As a rule, I usually enjoy kicking back and reading a Lescroart book. they are often interesting, and keep you wondering what will happen next. In addition, it is always good to see what Glitsky is up to next and what is happening with him. He is a good character, almost a kind of anti-hero that is rare in this genre of literature.With that said, in this case, I was happy to see more of Glitsky, not to mention Hardy, the enigmatic Freeman and the rest of the gang, but found the plot to be a bit too convoluted and contrived to really be believable. In the end, we aren't really shocked by who the killer is, and has happened in Lescroart's other mysteries. Sure, we wonder about the details, but I don't want to read over 400 pages just for that.I would say to read most of Lescroart's other books to get a taste of what he can do rather than read this one. He can do much better."
5,Lescroart Belongs on the Best Seller List,"I've read every one of John Lescroart's novels and he has never disppointed me. His characters are vivid and real and he is a master plotter. Why he is not an automatic best-seller author is beyond me, he is so much better than some of the authors who are always on the list. ""The Hearing"" is complex, satisfyingly long and very well plotted, typically Lescroart. Dismas Hardy, Abe Glitzky and all the usual characters are finely drawn and you feel you would recognize them if you met them on the street. This author is one of my very favorites, and I always look forward to a new book by Lescroart."
4,Works as expected,This is my third electric grill in 3 years. My wife says I am picky but I just want my pancakes to be evenly cooked from one end of the grill to the other. This grill does the trick at a little under 350'. I let it heat up for about 10 minutes and then cooked 8 pancakes across the entire grill. They all came off perfectly browned something my other grills could not do. I had hot and cold spots that prevented me form using the entire grill and sometimes even the same pancake was half cooked. This grill cook evenly. It sits perfectly flat and came pre-assembled. I think it is well made and it is pretty heavy which is a good thing. Some people complain about the handles being cheaply made. Well that is why I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars. They got the grill part down to 5 stars but the handles are 3 stars. If they improve them and make them a little thicker and nicer it would match the grill. They sort of put Pinto hubcaps on a Mercedes.
1,"poorly organized, hard to use","This book was obviously thrown together quickly. It lacks even the basic amenities of a professionally produced book, like headers and footers that would let you find your way through the many alphabetical topics. The index lists too many pages for each entry, rather than pointing to the useful ones. The attempts to distinguish standard from nonstandard HTML are useless, since many Netscape-supported options are listed ""MICROSOFT."""
5,A return of the classical fairy tale.,This is a book that reminds me of bedtime stories when I was a child. All the stories have a moral. I found it to be wonderfully refreshing and look forward to seeing more books by this author.
3,Overpriced - The 2011 one with the black cover is better,"The book is GREAT, but I recommended it to my friend and he got the EXACT same book for a cheaper price, I paid double what he did. It made a good read turn in to a resentment lolThe History of Magic. Eliphas Levi (Wooden Books Gift Book)The layout is also a little bit better too."
3,entertaining? yes; credible? not much,"A major part of this book contains lively narration of events and esoteric aspects of the development and evolution of magic. For the most part, The History of Magic is a pleasure-read. However, the book has several shortcomings in the form of factual errors and biased observations. Especially, with his discussion on the tradition of magic in eastern countries, Levi shows his incompetence as a historian and a good narrator. His vicious and prejudiced depiction of Indians as the descendants of Cain, and his contemptuous description of Indian system of yoga and mantras further proclaims that Levi has no place among great authors."
3,Light,"A typical John Power CD, this time with modest songs: I should say it's a CAST CD but in a 'light' version."
3,"Some good information, but unfortunately it's overrated...","I am a professional hypnotherapist. And this book was recommended to me as a useful reference. I can't see what all the fuss is about. I honestly think this book is overrated as well as overpriced.It is clear a lot of work went into the book which deserves some credit. Also the theme is a great one.The first part of the book is actually a great reference about hypnosis. But the actual ""scripts"" are of limited value: the therapist can glean some ideas there, but they are not scripts you can directly use for your own clients/patients. You'd be better off buying a book of actual usable hypnotic scripts."
4,A Dictionary of The Da Vinci Code,"This is a good little reference work for people who have been exposed for the first time to the Bloodline/Grail theories found in The Da Vinci Code. Cox gives each item its own dictionary-style entry with a factual description that is anywhere from a half page in length to three pages. As Cox writes, ""This book is designed in such a way as to give the reader of The Da Vinci Code a primer on many of the factual elements in the book."" I found the color photos especially helpful so that I could see for myself what is being talked about. This book has been faulted for Cox's unabashed support of The Da Vinci Code, but clearly that is what inspired him to put this volume together."
3,An apologia for Xenophobia,"In the most glowing terms, the author enamored of this Queen, makes excuses for her bad behavior. Using the ""times"" as a rationale, he mentions that she expelled the Jews, pursued the Moors, executed people who said they had converted to the Catholic religion. The inquisitions began under her reign. What, for heaven's sake is there to be proud of? However, this slavish tome does just that. She did have to fight for her rights as a monarch in a time when women were relegated to royal cows. That much I'll say, but this book mostly angered me. Now, if she had been forward thinking, I'd say that was something to read about."
4,Delightful mental jousting with a beautiful muse.,"Fun from beginning to end, John Fowles explores the never-smooth relationship between the author and his muse. Miles Green verbally and physically jousts for 200+ pages with his muse, Erato, as well as Dr. A. Delfie and the voluptuous Nurse Cory. If this doesn't excite you, I don't know what will. Extra fillips of pleasure for those who detest various sorts of modern criticism. It's a wonder John Fowles' Twaynes English Author Series Volume hasn't been recalled. He does not spare the rod. A warm, funny, smart book."
1,Don't bother!,"Many books have been labelled ""verbal masturbation"", but this is the real thing. John Fowles indulges his sexual and literary fantasies, entering them from every angle he can manage until he expends himself. What results is not ""one man's interaction with his muse"" as one review called it, but unreadable and pretentious and not remotely sexy subporn... that wouldn't have been publicised - or noticed - if they hadn't come from someone as well known as Fowles.Some of the parts, such as his encounter with a black nurse, and a guitar wielding dominatrix muse read like something out of a bored private schoolboy's diary.It's a pity, because John Fowles was once a great writer... but this book and ""Daniel Martin"" do him a great disservice.Mercifully short, and that's it's one bonus."
4,Easy to watch and follow,"I learned how to paint clouds with this, and of course, other things, but clouds are hard to paint. Worth the investment."
3,The Iron Giant,"My husband put this video on for the family. Although it sends a nice message about tolerance and understanding, it has too many scary parts and language for my taste. I would definitely not recommend it for younger children (perhaps 6 & up)."
2,Purchase,My grandson purchased this without permission. It's great to have a password to connect to the Wi-Fi but you need to extend it to purchases like the phone app.They semi enjoyed it.
2,"Technically excellent, but intellectually dishonest","There so are many good things about this movie that I really wish I could write a positive review. First of all, the animation is great. On par with Princess Mononoke. The characters are likeable, with the exception of the sterotypical paranoid government agent. The story line for the first two thirds of the movie is both funny and touching. Unfortunately, it goes down hill from there.After throughly enjoying the first two-thirds of movie, my viewing experience was ruined when the later third degenerated into an anti-gun rights, anti-government diatribe.If you want your children indoctrinated into that type of extreme left-wing dogma, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, I recommend you skip this one."
1,very disappointed,great until it got to it's anti-gun message. in this case the moral of the story is wrong. not recommended.
3,"Animated E.T., with more laxative jokes!","The Bottom Line:A wholly overrated film which has good intentions but never manages to get the feel of the 1950s right or shake the feeling that it's basically a retelling of E.T. with an ""iron giant"" instead of a muppet (lonely boy without a father finds a sweet and gentle creature from another world and makes friends with it but the evil government agents want it for their own shadowy purposes), the Iron Giant further suffers from weak voice acting and the requisite poop jokes; ultimately the film emerges as something considerably less than the classic it's made out to be.2.5/4"
4,Clever cartoon,"I had no idea what to expect when watching this movie, but bought it based on high reviews everywhere. Simply, this is a solid family movie that may drive you nuts if you don't go in with this in mind. However, there are several clever moments and I actually teared up at the end -- and it's a cartoon!"
4,The Iron Giant (Special Edition),"This video was surprisingly well done. It's a great story and the animation was wonderful. For a children's story, I thought it was a mistake to use the words ""hell"" and ""damn"" in it--so be advised."
3,somewhar dreary dont you think?,this kid finds a gigantic iron giant in this one.he wants to keep it.but has to keep it a secret.so he hides it out at the junkyard but thats until the government tracks it down.the kids like it but there are a couple of questionable parts such as a psycho who intimidates the kids mom and has a plan to keep them apart forever.he is very vocal and mean on this part.the other involves a death at the end.the guy who shacks up with the kids mom is over the top annoying.there probably wont be anymore parts.
4,Enough good and bad guys to keep it moving,"This was a sweet movie, with enough good and bad guys to keep it interesting. I was skeptical of all of the 4- and 5-star reviews, but now, I'm a believer."
4,Adorable M,"This is a wonderful, family friendly film that teaches the value of true friendship. Then end is a tear-jerker so be prepared! Bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loves it. Enjoy!"
5,Iron Giant is a GREAT movie!,This is a terrific movie - the best one we've gotten for our 3 year old son. The whole family can watch this again and again. I mean it -- this is as good as Toy Story!
4,Very entertaining,"A good story with likeable characters, and the ""adult"" jokes within are not crude like so many of today's CDI movies from the big studios. Very entertaining for me AND the kids! Gotta love Harry Connick, Jr. as a beatnik!"
3,Really Short Sox,"They run small. The 10-13 size is obviously not men's sizing. I wear a man's 11, and the sox are almost an inch too short."
3,"Some classic moments, but overall a bit dull","I remember really enjoying this film aas a young child. Funnily enough only for the scenes which I consider now ""classic moments"". These include James Garner driving into the pool, the soap suds in the back yard, and DOris Day's first day on the job as the Soap model.However, the overall film is quite dull and I can see why it is not one of Doris's most famous films. When people think of a Doris film, they think of ""Pillow Talk"". It's rare to find folks that remember this movie.It's nice to see the film again after all the years, but it did drag ..."
3,"Pretty, but severely scratched.","I received these trays as a gift for my birthday. Both trays were very beautiful but had identical, very large black scratches (same 3 bold scratches on each) all over the bottom of both trays. Obviously it wasn't a damage that happened during shipping process (even though the trays WERE poorly packaged) because they both have the in the exact same markings on both trays, and they were packaged one inside of the other. So these were damaged that way BEFORE they went sent out to me. I can't really complain because the price was moderately low, but it definitely takes away from the overall look of the trays and leaves me pretty disappointed."
5,loved it,Callas singing Harbanera backed by the chorus is majestic and sublime. Heard it one day at work on public radio and had to have it.
3,Would not recommend,"I originally bought this printer at Comp USA because the sample picture that it printed out looked great! However, to my dissapointment, when I printed pics at home, the quality wasn't nearly as good. Also, after a few months of owning the printer, the colors of any colored object were completely off - usually had a red tint to them. I thought this might be because the cartridge needed to be replaced, but that didn't help. I would only recommend this printer if you wanted to print in black and white text documents exclusively."
4,The Truth is a Dangerous Thing,"A novel about the black sheep of a British family, England Made Me is an indictment of the ""solid morals"" that English society held fast to in the early twentieth century, and an incisive look at what ""doing the right thing"" actually leads to."
3,A real slog,"Graham Greene is my favorite author, and I've read most of his novels, but for me, this was a real slog to get through. In fact, the only reason I finished reading it was to learn from his usual excellent use of similes and metaphors. To me the conflict was meager, the plot boring, and the characters not all that interesting. I kept waiting for a brilliant twist in the plot, or some thrill, but alas, I finished reading the book wishing I'd read something else instead."
3,The Right Stuff..,I really enjoyed this movie. It was cool to see movie stars when they were young...
5,I'm hearing good things,"I know a couple of moms who use this baby sling and they seem to like it a lot! They say it works well, especially in cold weather, keeping the baby warm and content."
5,Love this sling!,"I love this sling. It is lightweight, not hot and sweaty and holds the baby in safely without adding pressure on my shoulder and back. My daughter is 4 months old and has grown out of her other sling so we bought this one. We love it! :)"
4,It's nice,"I WOULD NOT USE IT FOR NEWBORNS! I was so afraid to use it with my then newborn-their necks bend forward and it could prohibit breathing. Follow the instructions and wait until they are 4 months or so to really use it confidently.On a positive note- the fabric is gorgeous and the product is so sturdy and well made. I am hoping my son will love it as much as i do so far. If you want more information on the product, check youtube for the videos on how to use it."
3,Not what I expected...,Baby not here yet so not able to try it out but it looks sturdy maybe for a older infant but not a newborn.
2,Difficult to use,"It is just too difficult to use it. It's just been sitting there. Maybe I am the type who doesn't like to read instructions; they seems to long to read. When I try it on with my baby, it doesn't seems to work."
3,lively and adventurous- unpredictable,"hello, my name is nina. i liked this book because it is educational yet adventurous. it was unpredictable, i never knew what would happen next. the reason i rated it a three was because some parts were not well explained and every now and then i would get lost and have to re-read some sections. otherwise this was a magnificent, adventurous tale and i would recommend it for older children and young adults."
2,Don't return again...,"This book is just not very good, in my opinion. The story was totally unbelievable, in a way that even most horror stories cannot approach. I forced myself to finish it, to see if it ever became interesting, but it never did. Disconnected, implausible storylines fail to mesh throughout the book. Stephen King is not my favorite author, but his horror fiction is certainly always much better than this. If you are interested in Southwestern mystery-type stories, read any of the excellent works by Tony Hillerman. I can't recommend this one, and won't read any others by Bentley Little."
1,What an absolutely horrid piece of pulp.,"Flat, lifeless imagery. Characters without a trace of personality. Pathetic plot development. And the absolute worst ending I have ever read. If it were within my power, I would not only demand my money back but also insist that Little compensate me for the time wasted reading this tripe. If you want to read something from a writer with actual talent, try Simon Clark."
2,weak,"The Return started out as a seemingly very promising horror story. Once I got further into the story I realized that it was turning into a very weak offering from Bentley Little. A mummy with a red afro?? Come On!! Very unrealistic even for a horror novel!Too many questions were left unanswered. Such as what happened to the town that dissappeared? What happened to the people that dissappeared? What exactly was the Mongolon Monster??? The answers to these questions were very vague in the story.Also the end of The Return seemed to be rushed. The build up to the supposed climax was satisfying enough, however, the climax of the story itself was anything but!Skip this one. Bentley Little has written some excellent horror novels. Try The Store, The Revelation and The Walking."
3,I've grown to expect more from Bentley Little,"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I AM an avowed Bentley Little fan. The Ignored is among my alltime favorite books._But I'm a realistic one, too. I know that they can't all be winners. And this isn't one.Yes, some of the incidents are ridiculous. Pestles (or is that mortars?) that walk aren't known to strike fear into the hearts of readers. And they don't this time.And what was with the mummies? Either they were supposed to be alive and evil, or they weren't? I couldn't really tell what was up with them. They mostly just laid there.And the ending? Among the worst I've ever read. This is a drawback in many, many horror novels, and Little has had trouble finishing his novels in the past. But this one was SO anticlimatic. It just fizzled out when it should have been apocalyptic. The demon, or whatever it was, just stood there and took it's medicine.It definitely ended not with a bang, but with a whimper."
2,Ah...Stupid!,"I've read 3 novels by this author ""The Summoning"", ""Dominion"", ""The Return"" I think his writing style is very simplistic and a little opportunistic but he is a guilty pleasure nonetheless!. The first book above was fun, scary, gory and original but seriously flawed. The second book was flawed but was so gory that it kept my interest till the end. ""The Return"" is a confusing mess, it's absolutely awful, and I wish it would return to the wretched cess pool from which it was spawned. I'm not giving up on him yet though. Don't always believe those blurbs you see on the front and back covers of books, Stephen King raves about this guy saying ""He is the best writer working now"" This is not true..."
1,Disappointing...,"Bentley Little is one of my favorite horror authors. I have purchased every one of his books. My favorites being University and The Mailman. I even liked his collection of short stories ('The Collection'). This book, in my opinion, just wasn't that good or interesting to me. Sorry."
2,Possibly Little's worst book to date,"I've read several of Mr. Little's books and overall am satisfied. His writing isn't as compelling as King, Masterton, Koontz, or Straub but something about the stories he writes I usually like. Not this one. I do have to say that the first 100 pages were most terrifying building up what I thought would be a fantastic read but from there it took a serious descent downhill. The last thrity pages or so were almost too hard to finish it got so boring."
3,Disappointing,"The content of the book matches the description above, and it does provide a reasonable overview of the field (from an academic perspective).However the book had plenty of grammatical problems, and I just found the content itself to be rather mundane, average and disappointing.Probably only useful to academics looking for frameworks and an introduction to the literature, but even then, as I said before, it really fell quite a bit short of my expectations. Nothing here that you wouldn't find by just looking at the proceedings of some average conference in knowledge management and semantic web."
2,Too Much Money,"This is a nice anthology with some excellent selections, but there is really no justification for the high price tag. Close to 90% of the selections are in the public domain (this includes the translations. For $100 I should get a modern translation of Kant, not one that is over 100 years old!). All this material (again, including the translations) is readily available online for free. The introductions are very slim, not very informative and do not justify the extremely high cost. A book like this should cost around $30-$40. I teach at community colleges and I am getting real tired of assigning students books that cost more than the tuition for the course."
5,"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews ""Selected Writings""","In just 264 pages this book effectively conveys the essence of the philosophy of the founder of modern anarchism. Writing in the mid-nineteenth century, Proudhon's views still have relevance today.His mutualism or anarcho-syndicalist style of anarchism attempts to fit into the realities of the industrial age rather than submerge itself in dreams of the pastoral agrarian past.During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) the followers of Proudhon's style of anarcho-syndicalism were a major political party which controlled the city goverment of Barcelona and the Catelonian province in Spain. From this base they fought against Franco's fascists on the side of the Spanish Republic."
4,Elated and dissappointed,"Last October I purchased this harmonuca in order to reach some heretofore unreachable notes at the lower end. I was very pleased with the instrument to do that...however, this June I purchased an identical Hohner 364 24 12 hole Marine band harp for my playing partner and was dissappointed that the notes of each instrument at the lower end were not the same and that the newer instrument left chunks of varnish (paint?) in his mouth after playing.Is there any way Hohner can make this right? I also own 3 Hohner chromatic harmonicas and I would like to continue to brag about Hohner's dependability and craftsmanship.Please advise,Sincerely,Leon Hakes"
1,Terrible product,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! Terrible design: too big/heavy, mouth piece is too thick and causes dripping after attempting to drink from it. The cup also spills from the lid other than the spout. Company will not allow you to return the product once it's used. (So tell me, how would you know if it works unless you use it?)A good company would stand behind their product; this one does not.I will never purchase from this company again."
3,funny for a monster movie,"theres this little cute fuzzy mogwai that a dad buys his son for xmas.there were only 3 very simple rules to follow.of course they failed.then the cute one got wet and reproduced dozens of times.then they ate after midnight and became scaly and evil.then they go rampage the town.the kids like it but watch when the chick tells ho hos secret.the way she found out that there was no santa was that thier father tried to come down the chimney dressed as santa and got killed.they dont show this but she does tell the story.its not as good as the sequel i think.its a pretty well likeable movie.it takes place at xmas time.id say its top 10 if it could be counted.its really too silly to be taken very serioius.but its fun.they say its good and it is.the message is if its easily to avoid,then avoid it.the special effects are way better in part 2.will there ever be a gremlins 3?i seriously doubt it."
3,still fun and hip,"ever wanted to throw a pet in the microwave? it's gross fun (with Judge Reinhold AND Hoyt Axton, no less) if you don't think about it. rather obvious satire (suprisingly produced by one of its biggest targets) and a rather crude one at that."
4,classic movie,If you have never seen Gremlins I urge you to find a copy - even buy it - and watch. It's lighthearted and a great movie made before CGI.
4,Gremlins review,"I thought this movie was creative, full of fresh ideas, and fun! This is a good movie for older children, I wouldn't show the scary, mean parts to small children. This movie is a wild ride and a fun experience!"
5,Classic!,"I was thinking about 80's things that I really loved, things all kids today MUST know about to be complete little beings...and Gremlins was one that I thought my kids had to see. So I ordered it, told my kids how when my sister was 5 or 6 she was terrified of Gremlins and hid behind the sofa when we watched it... they got a kick out of that. We watched it, they loved it (so did I!) No one cried or hid. They of course now want a Gremlin of their own. I had them call my sister after we watched the movie. When they told her they had just watched Gremlins- she only remembering being scared asked me - You let them watch that movie?! Isn't it scary!. How funny that at 24 she is still scared of Gremlins. My kids giggled and teased her. This is a must see - along with Labrynth, ET, original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future...all those GOOD, FAIRLY CLEAN 80's movies. Was a blast seeing Gizmo again...we have watched it 4 times in 2 weeks."
5,STILL EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,"Just had to watch it again -Gizmo, being so cuddly makes you want to have one of these creatures. How could he have such rotten offspring?Poor old dad and his inventions - they never seemed to work.Loved mom's methods of getting rid of the Gremlins even though she didn't know what she was fighting.What a come down for the Gremlins after the theater scene - poor old Stripes was all alone.The scenery was beautiful but seemed like everything was frosted not just snowed upon.Loved the ride-a-chair up the stairwell - would have liked to have seen more of that house.Characters were great - even the dumb cops.Wonderful entertainment."
2,Gremlins,"I would not recommend this movie. It was violent, and scary. When my mom and I watched this a few years ago, my mom had to turn it off halfway to the middle. If it hadn't been made before PG-13 was invented, that's what this movie would have been rated.A lot of kids would say this movie isn't scary, but that's because so many kids today are allowed to see rated R, which is as bad as it gets.Don't get this movie unless you like to be disturbed!P.S. Please don't insult my review in your own, thank you!"
3,Gizmo,"I remember seeing this movie when I was little, and Gizmo was all I really remembered of it, I'm glad. This movie is actually really poorly written, but the gremlins are just so cute you forget. Watch out though, I bought this for my daughter and there is a scene in it where the kids are talking about why they don't believe in Santa. My daughter is 4 she didn't really catch it, but any older and you could have a discussion you don't want to have on your hands."
5,Gremlins (Special Edition),"When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter. There is a huge responsibility in looking after Gizmo as there are certain rules which must be followed. The Mogwai must be kept away from bright light, never made wet and never, ever be fed after midnight. When an accident occurs involving Gizmo and water, the next evolution stage of the Mogwai appears, and it isn't nice at all. Gremlins is a fantastic comedy movir from 1984. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well. This was one of Joe Dante's first movies and you can tell that everything he grew up with and movies he studied as a child are on-screen in Gremlins. A perfect movie made by the right director."
5,FUNNY,I LOVED IT I HAVE SEEN IT 6 TIMES ALSO WITH MY GRANDKIDS THEY LOVED THE FUNNY OLD LADY WITH THE CATS MY SELF I LIKED THE PUB WITH BOGGIE IT WAS JUST A GREAT MOVIE AND I WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"First of all, this DVD has about 10 minutes worth of material. There is absolutely no reason to use 2 DVDs, so just by virtue of the packaging choice, you are being overcharged. Second of all, the Dunstan language is basically common sense distilled into 5 very basic points. You ""learn"" how to understand the cries for hunger, tiredness, burping, gas and discomfort. When I watched the video, my baby was 2 months old, and I felt like I already knew my baby's basic cries, just as I suspect any parent would. Furthermore, the video includes ""solutions"" to address the various cries, but the ""solutions"" are ridiculously obvious. For example, she tells you that when you hear the hunger cry, the ""solution"" is to feed your baby! Seriously, you'd have to be very dense to benefit from the information in this video."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I'm glad I bought this used on Amazon--it wouldn't have been worth the full price. That said, it was somewhat helpful in our case. Our baby's hunger cry didn't sound anything like ""Neh"" in the video, but we already knew how to recognize that. The part of the DVD that helped us was the ""Eh"" and ""Eaire"" cries for upper and lower gas, respectively. We have a very ""windy"" (gassy) baby so that has helped us to know when to burp him. As some other reviewers have stated, this language system could have been consolidated into a single DVD."
2,dunston baby language,I found the language to be more confusing than helpful. Very hard to tell difference in baby sounds. My husband and I kept looking at each other... is it an eh or neh??
5,Fantastic!,I'm a new mom of four days and I purchased this DVD for myself 3 weeks ago after hearing a little about it from a friend. Boy am I impressed! The information given is very simple and easy to follow. I was instantly able to recognize Mason's different cries and take appropriate action. Otherwise I would probably be tearing my hair out trying to figure out that he needed to eat yet again after just finishing a meal. Worth every penny and then some.
5,Not just for parents,I bought this as a gift for my sister before her first baby but I have found it also helps me with my babysitting duties. I don't have kids of my own and was worried that my lack of experience might mean that I didn't feel confident enough to play a large part in this baby's life. Thanks to this I don't feel like I am getting it all wrong. I would recommend the system not only to new mothers but to extended family as well.
4,Great!,"I Bought the DVD a month after I had our beautiful baby girl Larissa.I must say it was an act of desperation. She just cried and cried and cried.I received the DVD on a Friday afternoon and by Monday the relief wasintense. I got it! A week later now and I hear her cry and instantly knowwhat she wants. I'm not saying she doesn't cry at all anymore, I can justfigure out why a lot quicker and calm her so much faster so that she doesn't become wrought with distress. There are so many world shattering smiles now.The DVD was simple, laid out in plain language. I found it got better after a couple of watches to really get my ear in tune. I recommend it for EVERY new parent."
5,baby language works,"I really liked the DVDs. I know some people don't believe it and say it doesn't work, but if you get at least two understood words from this, it's worth it! I'm a new mom and I was pulling out my hair wondering what my baby wanted- immediately, I recognized ""upper gas"" ""eh"" and I burped him. He settled down and went to sleep!Maybe it doesn't work for some, but I loved it!"
4,Possibly the Best Bad Movie Ever!,"Sexy, funny, and full of action and dance scenes.Hilariously bad acting, stupid writing, and B-Movie action scenes.But %!$#!, the women are sexy. The dances are awesome. And it is supremely fun.Buy it and enjoy and wonderfully bad movie that few people in America have seen."
3,Its Totally ...,"Aqua, like a lot of other dance-techno groups have a distinct sound to them, and I think Aqua defines them all. Something about the type of music that is a hair between techno and pop that makes it so unresistable. I like it, and I've given Aqua and other groups like Sarina Paris, French Affair, etc., a genere name all of their own: (...) Techno."
2,Where did all the Mojo go?,I bought Aquarium and was happy... I loved to hear tracks like 'Dr. Jones' and 'Lollipop'. Aaaah them were the good ol days. Then Aqua released another album... Aquarium... I bought it and alas... the one thing that made aqua aqua... was gone... the happiness is gone... replaced by an almost depressing feeling of a black and white parade in the 1940's... all the tracks sound the same and the only thing i can picture is a little black and white version of red riding hood you keep begging to see be attacked by a wolf. I'm sorry but this CD does not live up to any of the expectations I had had for it. I heraby dub this cd... HARDCORE AQUA FANS ONLY2 starsit gets one star cuz i can't pick zero and another for the neat little enhanced goodies on it.
1,Junk,"I've been working my way through a number of different off brand Wii controllers, nunchucks, etc. These didn't last 3 weeks, neither of them. So far nothing I've bought in the < $10 range has survived more than a month. Not ready to give up yet, but these weren't the ones."
2,EASILY FORGOTTEN,"Sex, sex, and more sex....where's the suspense? Even with the great opening sequence in which Max Jaxon crashes his glider into the side of a mountain, what happens in the rest of this soft-porn farce is tedious, confusing and full of characters it's hard to like. How can we like our hero, Max? He thinks with his you know what, and his lack of commitment and his own egotistic desires brands him superficial and super-boring. Kristen is almost as bad, she falls for anything; Maggie is a Jekyll-Hyde lesbian with more teeth than a comb; Nicole is a self-centered and murdering golddigger; Chris Daniel is a cop with no sense of humor and some of the stiffest dialogue ever written.While the ending does pull a good surprise, it's torture getting there.NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,"Calming, comforting, funny and touching","I am reading this book for the third time. Seems I want to read it every winter when my cooking urges kick in. I have tried lots of recipes in this book and they are wonderful. I even searched stores for the ""vanilla sugar"" mentioned and actually found it. I am not Jewish but I LOVE this book. It is obvious that cooking and memories of grandparents are not confined to one religion, ethnicity or region. I wish Elizabeth would write another book!"
3,Unspoken Words,I really liked this book because it's a book about a boy and his father and the boy making his father proud of him. I liked it because it teaches an important lesson on responsibilty.
4,great price for great sheets,"My mattress is 22 inches thick. It has been a nightmare to try and find sheets, at a reasonble price. Not only do they feel great, they look very great."
3,Kindle version riddled with typographical errors,"I have only just recently bought my Kindle. I have read many of Gillian Bradshaw books based upon Rome and the Mediterranean in print, and have very much enjoyed them. I purchased this for my new Kindle. It has literally hundreds of typographical errors. Some minor that don't interrupt the flow of the book much once you learn to ignore them and not be frustrated. But there are some that I have to stop and think and figure out what it actually should be so that it makes sense. Very frustrating. I don't find these kinds of errors in print books."
1,simplistic and not realistic,"This is not a very good book- it's written as though it's intended for a sixth grade audience- one which knows nothing about Imperial Rome. The protagonist behaves in an unbelievable way- NO Roman citizen of the period would spend even a fraction of the time that this guy does worrying about the slaves and their treatment. And a Roman consul who physically attacks a citizen- unbelievable. Then there is the woman who rescues our hero, the female gladitator! Don't waste your time. The mysteries of Steve Saylor and Lindsey Davis portray a much more accurate picture of ancient Rome and it's citizens."
5,Review of Human Body,"I purchased a group of these books after talking to a new group of nursing assistants who had not been taught much about anatomy. I seemed to be the best of several books in terms of explaining how things worked, in a very accessible manner. I reminded my of the anatomy book that I read as a teenager, which inspred me to become a physician.KUDOS"
5,THE EVOLVING HUMAN BY PENNY KELLY,"THE EVOLVING HUMANThis is a profound book. It has altered my view of reality, and our place of humans in it. The author tells of her startling experience and then shares her process of integrating it. In the course of doing so, she outlines the further reaches of possible human development"
2,Cds not playable,"I am not pleased with the purchase of these Cds, two of the cds are not playable they freeze. I have cleaned them and still they freeze in the same areas. I guess the price was too good to be true. My fault on that one."
4,A Land Remembered,"Very interesting novel that spans three generations of settlers in Florida. Highly recommended, especially for newcomers to Florida!"
5,Book,This is an excellent book that should be read from anyone who was born in Florida. I could not put this book down!
5,A Floridian's History Book,"I'm a fifth generation Floridian. This book made me feel as if I knew the McIvey family, it was as if I was reading about my family's past. This book shows the reader the beauty of old Florida. We should respect this lovely state and try to preserve it for the future. The author has a meaningful environmental message. I recommend it to anyone--especially Floridians..."
2,A flat story of a flat place.,The characters are not believable and the plot is is not engaging. It could be used in middle school for an atmospheric read of Florida in the 19th century.It is not challenging enough for serious readers or anyone who knows anything about Florida.
4,Wonderful history combined with fiction,This book has such history and depth. Amazing descriptions of Florida before all of the development! A must-have for any Florida resident!!! Highly recommended.
5,A Land Remembered,"For anyone who has ever wanted to know the history of how Florida was settled, this is certainly the right book! Very descriptive and not for the faint of heart! Having lived in the area north of Lake Okeechobee for many years, cattle and orange groves are to this day in abundance!"
2,"Big Stars, Big Mess","Most of my favorite films are 50s-60s. I almost always like Sophia. Peck was never one of my favorites. That said, Arabesque is missing on all cylindes. Characters are uninteresting, plot is 3rd rate, circumstances are absurd and while the right casting can salvage a poor film sometimes, it isn't happening here.I was looking forward to that increasingly rare treat of a good movie (from that era) that I didn't recall seeing before but instead, there is no chemistry, no energy, just a lot of .... forget-ability."
3,Could be better,"The first five cuts on this low-cost album are solid Four Freshmen hits, and the sound is excellent. After that, however, we get a mishmash of the group's weaker entries--some with lots of ""doowahs"" typical of the 1950s. There are better Freshmen albums available for a couple of dollars more."
4,Good book in a bad cover,"Oh dont get me wrong i love this book...its from a genuine movie freak who lives,breathes and eats boobies oops movies...though i kinda have a diff opinion about some of his choices and some coolest moments as he describes them, its still a good work. Only 1 flaw ..major flaw...the packaging of the book is too cheap...the text is blurry on the cover and it looks like a used or should i say 5th hand...i dont know maybe its the case with only my copy or all have the same..."
5,Two birds with one order,My daughter and I had watched and thoroughly enjoyed the original showing;Dick Francis remains one of our favorites authors. We then later shared thecost and the viewing of the videos. This order replaces our tapes andprovides a Christmas gift for her.
2,NOT FOR ELONGATED TOILETS,"This product fits in an elongated toilet. However, it can freely move a few inches back and forth, leading to instability when sitting down or standing, especially for people with impaired mobility. That's because the size of the part that sits inside the toilet bowl is a few inches shorter in the front-to-back dimension than the opening in an elongated toilet bowl.I came up with a solution, using a bungee cord strapped to the two back legs and stretched around the back of the toilet, which prevents the seat from moving resulting in a much safer configuration. However, it would have been far superior if this product were available in a second version for elongated toilets with an insert designed for them."
5,"Really Outstanding - Modern Instruments, Period Performance","This is an unusual version of the Brandenburgs by the New Bach Collegium under Bernard Pommer in using modern instruments with the techniques of period performance. Thus, it has beautiful tone but with the crisp, lively rhythms of early instrument versions, without the astringency. It also features a more chamber-like individuation of the instruments rather than doubling up as is more common with modern instrument versions. In short, the best of both worlds and excellently performed. This is really outstanding. Also recommended: volume 1, containing concertos 1, 2 and 3; and, their even finer version of ""The Art of Fugue."""
4,GODDESS,"WHITNEY HOUSTON HAS THE VOICE OF A GODDESS-DESPITE ALL THE RUMORS AND SPECULATION ABOUT HER PERSONAL LIFE-SHE REMAINS IN MY OPINION A CLASS ACT-THIS IS TRULY A COMPILATION OF HER GREATEST SONGS! THERE IS NOT A PURER VOICE IN THE INDUSTRY-YES IT IS A LITTLE RASPIER NOW AND THE NOTES ARE SHORTER-BUT ON A BAD DAY SHE STILLS SOUNDS BETTER THAN HALF THE ""ARTIST"" OUT THERE! NEVERTHELESS, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS CD DID NOT INCLUDE MIRACLE, THINKING ABOUT YOU AND NOBODY LOVES ME W/JERMAINE JACKSON. I WILL REMAIN A WHITNEY HOUSTON FAN FOREVER!"
2,greatest hits,I was a little disappointed in the content of CD. There are some great songs on there but I feel that Whitney had so many great songs that should have been included
4,Overall A Great Album,"Personally, the first disc was my favorite, just because I love ballads so much. The only thing I would change about the first CD was include the song ""miracle"" to the line-up. That has always been one of my personal favorites from Whitney. I loved the new song ""Same Script, Different Cast"", and I think it will go on to be another #1 hit. The second album was pretty good, but I would have rather had some more of the original songs, and less of the Re-Mixes. Some of the re-mixes are pretty good, but I would have rather had songs like ""I Wanna dance With Somebody"" and ""Be My Baby Tonight"" left as originals. I was pleased that they included the song ""one moment in time"" as a bonus track. Overall, I thought that this was a great album, and worth the $20."
4,"Lose the Mixes, Miss Whitney!","This would have been a great CD package if it had been kept to one disk. The first CD covers all of Ms. Houston's big hits from 1985 to the present and adds a few bonus selections in. This CD exemplifies how much she has grown vocally over the last 15 years, and is great listening.The second CD, ""Throw Down"" is a collection of remixes of the same hits with a few extras added in. With one or two exceptions, these mixes sound alike, don't make much sense by themselves, and are pretty annoying all together. If I want to dance, I'll go to a club, thank you."
2,"Some good songs, but leave out the remixes!","There are definitely some good ballads on here that remind me of my childhood, but my favorite fast songs are not the originals! Instead, they're repetitive remixes that almost have the same background beat! *sigh* I remember the good old days...when greatest hits albums were actually ""Greatest Hits"" and not ""A Few Hit Singles, Remixes, and A Few New Songs""!!"
2,Whitney's Greatest Not So Great!,"If you're looking for Whitney's greatest hits, buy the other albums. Even though most of our favorites are on this 2-disc album, many of them are remixes that sound horrible. Especially if you are a big fan of her hit, ""I Will Always Love You,"" you will be terribly disappointed. Her previous hits were good, but this album kills most of them. Although the remixes have a great beat, many of them sound like they don't go with the lyrics at all. Whitney could have done better if she would have stayed with the originals that her fans have loved over the years!"
3,Greatest hits ruined by needless remixes,"I have been a fan of Whitney since day one and I think she has one of the greatest voices in pop music today. The first CD, Cool Down, features her ballads and it is sheer heaven to hear her crystal clear vocals in her earlier hits like ""You Give Good Love"" and ""All At Once"". I was a tad disappointed that ""Hold Me"", the duet with Teddy Pendergrass is not included here and I'm not sure why it was excluded. And the beautiful ""One Moment In Time"" is remixed and placed on the dance CD which is also disappointing. The second CD features her dance hits set to remixes. WHY? They pretty much all sound the same and are not as good as the original recordings. Love the ballad CD but HATE the dance CD."
3,Well--,"Well, this is what I thought I wanted from Whitney, but it turns out I was wrong. Or rather the record company was wrong. While I was extremely pleased with all of the original hits and cleary recognize them as the greats, the 2nd CD was not what I was looking for. I could think of so many more of her songs that could have been included instead of some of the new and less appealing cuts that were. Not to take anything away from Whitney because she is the best, but this disc should have been one CD."
2,disc 1 great /disc 2 disappointing,I did not care for the mix and on disc 2. Disc 1 is outstanding Whitney Houston. I would have enjoy Disc 2 is she would have left out the mix.
2,"Looking for a Greatest Hits collection, save your money","I enjoy Whitney but I am not a huge fan so I was looking for a collection of greatest hits. Well most of the collection consists of songs I have never heard and don't really care much for and the ones that I would call hits are all, in my opinion, very bad remixes rather than original releases. If you are like me and just looking for a nice collection representative of a great artist's work, this is not the collection for you."
2,Greatest Hits?,"Basically what is wrong witht the CD is that the first disc is just boring. Having all the ballad one after another just kills it. They are amazing songs to listen to, but 17 in row just makes it all sound bad and I can't even liten to the disc all the way through.And there is the 2nd disc what is even the point of this? To ruin great songs. The remixes arn't even good. The only ones I like are the remixes to ""My Love Is Your Love"" and ""How Will I Know"". The original versions of the songs are so much better. This is not a greatest hits album. It just makes all her songs sound horrible."
3,"It gets half stars for disk one, but none for disk two",Disc one is a good slow jam greatest hit's CD with all of the best slow songs and theyre all great. But disc two Why Whitney!? Why!? I mean that disc sucks to death all of the dance song all been horibly remastered and have these crappy techno beats that completely ruins the songs completely. If you buy this CD try to just get the first disk and burn the second disc.
2,Not great,"Have always liked Whitney songs, but disc 2 is a waste!!!! disc one is the only disc i listen to. Not sure what they were thinking on disc 2. Save yourself dont buy this one."
2,Disappointment,"I didn't realize I was buying a CD full of remakes. When I buy greatest hits, I expect to get the original versions."
3,NOT what I wad expecting...,"I did not realize that these were remix versions! I like them yes, but I really wanted a CD of THE ORIGINAL greatest hits. Definitely NOT what I was expecting!!! :-("
4,music to my ears,Whitney Houston - The Greatest HitsLots of great songs by Whitney showcasing her beautiful voice and biggest hits. It was a real trip down memory lane for me and brought tears to my eyes. A fabulous addition to my cd collection.We lost a world great when we lost Whitney Houston. Now she really is an singing 'angel'.
5,"Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it?","Did you know that, Christie?It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but ""The Greatest Love of All"" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album."
3,Too many remixes,"I've been wanting this CD since it came out and now that I have it I'm really disappointed. I should've checked the track listing before buying it beacuse I can't stand the remixes. I was looking forward to having a simple compilation of my favorite Whitney songs on CD but what I got is not the Whitney I grew up listening to. If you're reading this, congratulations on not making the same mistake I did. If you like club mixes go ahead and buy this but if you want classic Whitney this isn't for you."
3,"REMIXES, not HITS!!","OK, I'm one of the people who bought this album hoping that it has all the original recordings... I WAS DEAD WRONG!! The dance hits are ALL remixes and they all sound like a techno song! I feel really bad!! I really want to sell it back!"
1,Be Careful and Aware,This CD is too bad to write a review because when I received the package there was no CD 2 in it and I have to buy another to to avoid hassle in sending back for replacement.
3,Unfortunate production,"Louise is interesting and lovely work, the most important French answer to Italian ""verismo"" wich was, by the way, deeply influenced by Massenet in the beginning. This good sound recording is well conducted and has an idiomatic cast in every roles - except the title one, unfortunately. Both the young lovers are declining stars. In 1977 Sills had a style but her voice was lost. Although 52 years old, Gedda still had his clear tone and style, but his French is unidiomatic. The best of all is Jose van Damm as Father, curiously 12 years younger then his ""daughter"" Sills. With better production it would be a valuable recording, because Louise has few issues now. I didn't hear CBS/Sony version, but could be Cotrubas better?"
2,Cold Molding Boat Building,"The topic of the book is interest to a select few of us who like to build boats. The author like to build boats, seems to like to write but is not a writer. His descriptions of the steps are long winded and not descriptive. The photos that are refered to ar too small and lack teh requried detial to emphasize the points and tasks being desribed. Th ephots are about 2 x 2 inches, black and white and of low printed resolution. I am sorry that purchased this book."
2,Major Crash,"Read all the reviews before buying PhotoImpact 8.0. Was a Jasc user prior. Would love to say that the product was great, but I can't get it to work. Totally freezes my system. Re-installed 3 times. Start the program, computer totally crashes. Finally I've had to uninstall it again, put it on the shelf and be glad it works for others. Contacted Ulead by fax & email, no response, 3 days later. Not mad, just disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I upgraded to Photimpact 8 from version 6 - only it was actually a downgrade. Even after downloading the patch there are still to many bugs. After you chose a printer for one picture it doesn't remember which one or the printer setup for the next picture, even if you never leave the program. The The backspace key will not back up the lasso tool to a previous point as it did in PI6. About half the time the print command refuses to print unless you reset the resolution. But when you just click OK, the complaint goes away and it prints any way. The ruler keeps coming back to the print preview page no matter how many times you click it off, etc.I admit I haven't tried contacting Ulead. Their reputation for lousy customer service tells me it would just be asking for more frustration.Ron"
1,Beware,"I bought this program along with a new Dell Laptop. I thought it would simplify things. After 13 hours of data transfer I find it installed all the Office 2003 stuff from the old computer on top of the Office 2007 stuff on my new computer. I'll get it fixed eventually, but I would have saved a lot of time and effort if I had done things the old fashioned way.Don't waste your money."
4,Good product,This is a good tea at a great price. Will be ordering a larger amount in the future. The only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because i just received an order of Twinings Jasmine green tea and it is amazing!
2,Sprayer broke after a year of light use!!,"My sister and I each purchased this Bissell model because we both own dogs and there are a couple of carpeted rooms in our homes. I had researched the Bissell Proheat and the reviews all said the sprayer mechanism melted and quit working and they had recommended the little green without the proheat feature. Well, after a few months my sister's machine stoped sucking up the water and after a year the sprayer on mine completely stopped spraying. I have switched over now to the Bissell Spotbot for Pets and so far so good. It's got the handheld manual hose feature and the hands free smart clean which I LOVE because there is no scrubbing involved. I recommend it. As for the Little Green Machine and the Pro Heat models. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY or TIME!!! We had to just pitch them both in the end because it would have cost more to fix them then to replace them completely. :("
2,Great Job Cleaning - Machine itself is difficult to clean,"We bought this product because we have an elderly cat, who gets ALOT of hairballs. It does a fantastic job cleaning our light beige carpet from these nasty little messes....but I am truley disappointed that I cannot take the machine completely apart to clean it. I cannot find instructions anywhere on how to disassemble the machine to clean it. We've had it for a little over a year and a half now and after we use it, and do all the things the instructions tell us to do to keep the hose and parts clean, it still gets moldy ! YUCK. I think that is the reason why on the newer models of this machine Bissell choose to make the hose green colored, instead of the clear hose like the older machines have, becuase they don't want you too see the mold growing. I wouldn't recommend this machine based on the mold factor."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought the Little Green machine new. I used it twice, once to clean a spot on an area rug and once to clean car upholstery. The next time I tried to use it the machine would not turn on. No power at all. I changed outlets. Still no power. Tried the switch several different times. No juice. It is absolutely ridiculous that a new product can only be used twice before it breaks. The machine I have was never dropped or abused in any manner. It was cleaned carefully after each use and store properly indoors. If this is how Bissell creates products then I'll never buy from them again."
3,The Bissell 1400A was a disappointment !,I have wanted this little Green Machine for sometime now. But I failed to do my homework before I bought it. I really should have bought the Green Machine with the rotating turbobrush. I think it probably would do a better job for my needs. I have a problem with weak wrists so its hard to clean with it. I have cats and the hair on upholstery quickly plugs the suction cleaning tool. It also seemed to leave lots of water behind requiring longer drying time. The good points are this machine is light weight and good for little easy clean up jobs.
1,barely functioned; ate the spray; died,"Total piece of junk. The thing died-kaput--with just a few uses. Kept filling the chamber, and it still didn't work. Thinking it might be the batteries, I bought more batteries from the listed vendor-junk. Then, at a friend's suggestion, I bought pricey batteries at another shop (>$10 each), and they worked, for a short time. The problem appears to be the unit itself. I am left with 3 big extra cans of spray I bought and cannot use.Finally bought a Petsafe vibration type small dog collar---it works! And the batteries have lasted months! I don't use it often, but I've had it for 5 months and it still works when I use it. It cost 300% more, but it works and is less expensive considering the battery problems, along with the quick death of this piece of junk. My friends have had the same awful experience with this spray collar. Do Not waste your money on this!"
2,For one dog - I'm sure it's fine,"I have four Jack Russells who protect my home as their primary function. Unfortunately this is the 9th bark collar I have had to purchase as they continue to chew them off each other and then chew up the housing. The company will replace the collar but never the housing. They even tore into the box before it was unwrapped, and chewed up pieces of it. They don't like it much so I have to bribe them with a treat to put it on before I go to work.I refuse to shock them so I guess this is my only alernative."
2,ok til it broke,"Have a dog who barks if overly excited (when people come over) or if he wants something (attention, food). Worked pretty well for those situations. Although once he triggered it by scratching his neck and then just held still and looked pitiful. But after a few months of intermittent use it stopped working (tried refilling, tried new batteries, nothing helped)."
3,Not durable enough for our OTHER dog!,"I think this product would have been great. I put the collar on our dog and let her outside with our other dog. I went inside for 10 minutes, looked outside, and our other dog had chewed off the battery pack! Ended up being money down the drain. It may be an excellent product, but I would need something much more durable to endure our other dog!"
1,Anti-Bark? Nope.,"I purchased this to quiet the beast. She's a hound mix and is rather gentle with the kids and well mannered when inside, but when she's outside she barks like crazy. When I first put the collar on her, she barked a few times and seemed a bit confused about the result. For the next few days she barked less frequently, but now that she's been wearing it for about two weeks she doesn't seem to care at all. Now that I've burned through the included can of citronella I can proclaim that the collar doesn't work for my dog.Also, keep in mind if it doesn't work on your dog, you can't return this item.I recommend a shock collar since it actually works, we have one of those but we (my wife) thought we should try this since its more humane."
1,Made my dog sick! Don't take the risk!,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL! I was assured that this unit could be used on my 7lb Yorkie. Although it worked and my dog instantly stopped barking, he became completely lethargic after wearing it for about an hour and only two sprays! The unit had been leaking and sputtering the liquid from the citronella cartridge.Why take the risk? Don't buy it."
2,PROBLEMS,Two identical items ordered. Only received one. Call and reported shortage on Nov 6. Said they would check in to it and send another one. Called again Nov 20 they said it was out of stock and would send another one very similar to it. Called again Nov 28 and was told totaly out and no idea as to when it would be received and they would issue a credit for the one. Well we will see how long this takes.
1,Don't buy for small dogs!,"Even after several adjustments and trimming the collar down significantly, this anti-bark dog collar was also an ""anti-working"" dog collar for our small shi-tzu/poodle mix. After finally getting the fit we wanted, we (owners, not the dog) needed to blow directly into the mechanism to release the bark repellent. I would not recommend this product, especially for small dogs (<20lbs)."
3,Too sensitive!,"The citronella spray collar is great except that it is much too sensitive. I have taped multiple layers of padding over the microphone, yet it still sprays when my dog sneezes or shakes his head (he has floppy ears). I'm trying different materials to see if something else may work better to muffle ""regular"" noises but still allow barking to trigger the spray."
2,multi-dog house,"This is my third spray type bark collar. I've in the past purchase the Multi-vet brand and they worked great at first but quit after about 3 months. I decided for my new dog to try a different brand so, I brought the Premier brand. This one looks just like the others. The only difference is this one only worked for about a month. A month was not long enough to teach my new dog not to bark. Replacing the battery and cleaning the sprayer did help. I wish they would make a spray collar that would last."
3,Far too sensitive,"This is our second unit, and I find this one superior in some ways, but inferior in others. I do appreciate the on/off switch, which was a glaring omission on previous models. However, the microphone is far too sensitive and sprays my dog at inappropriate times such as when he yawns. There is no way to adjust the sensitivity, and this unnecessary correction confuses him. It is also easily set off my my other dog barking withing a few feet of him. The collar is fitted correctly and tight to his neck, but the problems persist."
3,High maintenence to keep it working.,"We ordered 2, and 1 was defective didn't work at all. It seems to be effective sometimes, but high maintenence with always having to check to see if is filled and if battery is working. Battery didn't last too long. Expensive to keep it working."
3,Don't forget replacement batteries...,"This item is great until the batteries die. They are extremely hard to find as they are weird camera battery size. Buy the refill too. The device is ok, but make sure you put it on the right way - read the directions carefully."
2,Maybe it sort of worked.,"My dog has separation anxiety, and my neighbors are getting fed up with the constant barking when we're away. I'm worried that our landlord will make us find a new home for her, so we're ready to try anything. This didn't work. It seems to annoy her at least a little, but for the most part, the anxiety seems too powerful for the collar. I get home, and the entire house smells like citronella. I watch her through the closet door, and she just paces and barks. The citronella seems to make her hesitate a little at the beginning, but when enough time passes, she's just barkzilla. I'm going to try the Thundershirt next in combination with medication from my vet and maybe the bark collar. Wish us luck!"
2,Not impressed,"It technically works, but it seems like you have to refill it every day. Or maybe it is just because it doesn't stop my dog from barking at all so it runs out quickly!"
3,Good while it lasted,"Bought this collar with high hopes. And, it did work well on my 3 year old rescue basset hound for about 4 months. Then one day she figured out that if she barked about 6 times, the sprayer would empty and she would be homefree to bark as much as she wanted. Once this happened, she did this each time I refilled the little chamber with the citronella. Now she is back to barking at everything and anything :-( My next step is to try the Innotek bark collar. Hoping for better results, and so are our neighbors!"
2,Not impressed,"I tried this product thinking it might work. I had tried a shock collar before this product and did not like the fact my dog was being shocked. I thought it was maybe the dog, but after trying it out on my one year puppy I realized it was not the dog and this type of product did not work. My biggest complaint is the spray runs out to quick."
2,Spray Bark Collar,"The collar doesn't seem to work for small dogs with high pitched barks. When I put the collar on my small dog, it seemed to work when she growled; however when she barks it does not work. Unfortunately to teach a dog not to bark the collar needs to be consistent with the behavior."
1,Imperfect product,"We have had this product for about 2 months. After the 1st 2 weeks, it stopped working & the folks at Premier were very helpful: They first suggetsed banging the product to clear bubbles, and this helped some. Then after another week or so it stopped working entirely, and the folks at Premier offered to replace it. Meanwhile, had complained to Amazon, who told me to contact Premier, but also sent me a replacement collar. So for the past mnth we have had TWO collars, and now neither is working, despite the banging we periodically do and replacing batteries and re-filling, although, based on past experience, one of them may start working again. Still the uncertainty is maddening, esp when one is using it to quite an otherwise disruptive, barking dog. My wife is too disheartened to call Premier again, since we are unsure what would be gained with a 3rd flaky collar. It's a great product when it works; getting it to work regularly has been an impossible task for us. Thanks"
1,Dog Collar - Citronella,"I am not happy with this product at all. It will only spray out the citronella once or twice and then stops and doesn't work after that. My dog has learned to tolerate the one or two sprays and then knows he can continue barking. I tried to contact Amazon about returning it but since it's a ""hazardous waste"" type of product they won't let you send it back and I couldn't even get information on who to contact about it being defective. I wouldn't recommend that anyone take a chance on this one."
2,Effective product... Horrible Collar!,I found that the overall product was effective...however it did not last long as the collar gets loose easily and the cheap plastic clip is not very secure thus making it easy for him to remove and continue barking. This is the only upgrade the product needs.
1,sensor activated by too many other things,"The problem with this is that barking is not the only thing that will set the sprayer to go off. I had my dog in the car with the collar on, he stuck his head out of the window and the sprayer activated. Ok, the rush of wind caused it so I can avoid this in the future. How about this, my dog was standing by me, shook his head like dogs regularly do and it caused the collar to activate. He didn't have on his regular collar with tags that could have bumped up against the spray collar, he didn't bark, he just shook his head. The result is now my dog is anxious, never really understanding why citronella is being sprayed in his face. Thanks gentle spray."
1,Doesn't last,"I bought this collar TWICE both times had the same result. It worked amazing for a couple of weeks, then just mysteriously stopped working. I tried replacing the battery and made sure it was refilled with citronella. The two quiet weeks we had were so wonderful I took my chance at buying a second one thinking that maybe the first one was just faulty somehow. But, it also only lasted a few weeks then just stopped working. Looking now for an alternative citronella collar."
2,Did not work on my dog.,"I think this will work for some dogs, but my dog didn't really mind the spray or figured out that if he kept barking the spray would run out or the battery would die. So for him, ineffective."
4,Great Product--Bad Batteries,"This collar works great with my 75 pound chocolate lab. He's gotten to the point where he recognizes the collar and knows it means ""don't bark."" Every now and then I will hear him bark at night--usually only once and then he doesn't do it again. The batteries do stink--especially if you don't turn off the collar during the daytime. I only make my lab wear this at night, but I've talked to my stay at home mom neighbor and she says that she has never heard him barking during the day. Amazon sells duracell batteries for this collar under the subsribe and save program--so buy the batteries from Amazon--they last longer and are cheaper than the brand that comes with the collar."
4,Perfect for my Mini Schnauzer.,This is a great product for my dog in my apartment. It doesn't hurt him in anyway and keeps me stress free leaving him alone knowing his barking was kept to a minimumThe only thing is sometimes the responsiveness of this product isn't very accurate. He needs to bark fairly loud for this to work.
2,Works great but doesn't last long,"I'm online now to buy my third one of these collars (fourth if you count the one given by a friend). The upside: the collar really works for my dog. I tried all sorts of other training methods (other than shocks) that didn't work. This collar stops him at one bark, if that. The downside: the collars just don't last, not even a year. If Premier would put a warranty on this item, they would find that they needed to invest a little in the quality of the product. They simply stop spraying after a while, even with a brand new battery and a refill. Normally I would not continue to buy an item with such low quality, but I'm addicted to a nice quiet house now, so I keep coming back. Expect about a 9-month product life, and that's if you NEVER forget and leave the unit on overnight!"
3,The collar only worked for a month!,"The collar worked good for my Jack Russell Terrier.. It stopped his loud barks but not the little barks he makes, which is understandable. He did learn that when the collar is not on, that he could bark because it wouldn't spray him. After about a month of him wearing it, the sprayer stopped working, even after filling up the spray and changing the battery. I can hear the clicking noise like it is going to spray but nothing comes out.. I'm trying to get the manufacturer to replace it, but we'll see what happens."
2,Did not Work For My Dog,"I have a Bichon that has recently developed the bad habit of barking at everything that moves outside the window. No matter how big or small. This collar works so much as it sprays when he barks, my dog could careless. After the first few sprays he was mildly distracted, then soon after he stopped noticing the spray."
2,Good when it was working.,"My little 8 pound yorkie used to go chasing after a friend of our's 70 pound dog, and it was so afraid of him! I used this one time, and he now leaves that dog alone! He only got sprayed 2 times. Also, he is crazy when he is on a walk and sees another dog... he used to yelp like I was beating him... it was very embarassing. This thing has stopped him from doing that too. Well worth the money I spent. I would recommend to anyone having similar problems!UPDATE: 11/5/12: MALFUNCTION!!! This worked great when it worked.. but now it just sprays my poor yorkie for no reason. We no longer use this. Too bad. Worked so well at first."
3,"Works great, if only for a day","It worked really well on my mini schnauzer, except it broke after one day of use. I'm hoping that it was just a ""flook"". I plan on buying another soon to test this theory."
5,Fantastic,"Our dog would not stop barking at the neighbors when they would come outside in the spring. It was a nuisance. After one bark with this collar, she stopped barking completely. She couldn't figure out where the spray was coming from and it distracted her from barking. It works like a dream. Now, after a few weeks of wearing it whenever she went outside, she can go outside without the collar and doesn't bark. We love this collar."
1,Broken Piece of Crap,The bark collar was great for the first few weeks. Then is sprung a leak. Now it won't hold much citronella and is useless. Don't buy this from Amazon because you won't be able to send it back for an exchange or refund if it breaks.
1,Spray Sense collars stop working,The Spray Sense collars used to be great and last a long time. In the last year I have bought 5 and they either broke after a couple of weeks or didn't work at all out of the box. The company told me they are having trouble with the manufacturer and replaced 3 collars so far. Haven't used them yet so can't say if they are any better. They look the same as the ones I returned.
1,Not very effective,"This product is not what I expected, the spray does not stay very long in the collar. i seems almost every time my dog barked I needed to refill the collar. I would not advise any of my friends to purchase this type of anti bark collar"
1,Failure!,"Followed directions precisely. Our dog barks with the collar on and it fails to spray so the whole training issue is a waste with this product. We adjusted it, reread the directions, etc. all to no avail. Don't waste your money. We are disappointed and hope others won't throw their money away on such a failed product."
2,Worked at first.,"I had really high hopes for this product to stop my dog from barking. I even had a relative that said it worked for her. Unfortunately, my dog toughed it out and would bark until all of the solution ran out and he was back to barking at full force. I probably says more about my dog and my training abilities than the product."
5,Worked GREAT for our barker!,"This collar is fantastic so far. We have a 50 lb Vizsla/Weimaraner who was barking at the cows next door and waking our daughter up. It really only took 1 spray for her to get it. We only put it on her when the baby is sleeping but she already ""gets it"" and doesn't bark when the collar is on.Easy to fill and use."
5,Worked Great!,My dog always barked at my husband when I was in our computer room and he was on the couch. I couldn't get her to stop without keeping a leash on her. It really only took the first time for the collar and she actually just stopped. The second day with the collar on she moaned a second and was done. Hasn't done it again since. Nice and quiet when I'm on the computer now.
5,Great Improvements,"We live on 6 acres with plenty of wildlife wandering through in the evenings. Of course, the dogs recognize the critters and the 'bark-fest' begins. We used this citronella collar in years past, but lost it from snags on barb wire and other. After months of no collar, the dogs wised up and the barking returned, so we purchased again and are very please with improved version.The pro is our dogs recognized the reprocusions in barking, and decreased the barking only to human visitors. In addition, this newer version has an On/Off switch to save on batteries, and the battery door was relocated to top side to avoid dislodging like previous versions. More good news, we used to pay $90-100 for these collars. This is well worth the money at $33.ConsThe batteries are not common and pricey at $8-10 each. I hope the on/off switch will permit longer battery life."
1,TOO BIG FOR 15 LB. DOGS - CANNOT RETURN ITEM,This collar is waaay to big for my small 15 pound dogs.Amazon will not take the item back. DO not order this unless youa re sure of the size....Very Frustrating....
1,Waste of $$$,"This collar is so sensitive that it would spray my dog when he yawned, wiped his face on the ground, and growled.It even sprayed him when my upstairs neighbors dog barked! My poor dog was so confused and freaked out by this collar I took it off within the first two hours and never put it back on. Am now using a ultrasonic anti bark device and this works great."
1,Don't wait you'r money or time...,"We have bought 2 sets of these collars. The first two began to leak the citronella spray after a couple of months. We have one that is still working from the second set which has a different ""updated"" look. But this company sells under the names of Innotec, Multivet and Premiere. So do not be fooled. You will get the same product from them all and it is not reliable for long. Too much to spend for only a few months of use. We are going with a more reliable and trusted brand this time, like Petsafe."
3,Works but is a little heavy for small dogs and spray runs out fast!!!,"The spray collar worked on my small terrier dog but she didn't like the heavyness of it around her neck. It did not work on my other dog, a pomeranian, she just ignored it and kept on barking. The spray ran out faster than I thought. If I had the collar turned on and my dog had her head out the car window, a motorcycle going buy would set it off on her.I would say that the collar halped diminish barking a little, but when the dog really wants feels threatened or has a strong urge to bark a lot, they just ignore the collar."
4,Lifetime Warranty (even without a receipt!),"I bought a few of the Citronella anti-bark collars, but I must have over filled them because the seal broke and they begun to leak. But true to their word, Premier offers free replacements so I got the new (refurbished) ones in the mail and they worked fine. They also sent me a free can of citronella spray to make up for any that leaked out. And I didn't even have to present my original receipt.My neighbors have stopped complaining and I'm not afraid to leave the house anymore.And the dogs smell lemony-fresh!I definitely recommend this product.And I definitely recommend buying it from Premier.Good luck with your barking dogs!"
5,awesome!,"Amazed at how well this has worked. It has a pleasant smell and stops my dog in his tracks with his barking. Now I don't even have to turn it on, we can just put it on him and he won't bark. He has always been known for his extremely loud annoying non stop barking, not anymore. It is humane, he is not injured or traumatized. He actually seems happier, and we are for sure. Thanks Premier! Wish I had it yrs ago, well worth the money"
4,Works well... with some fine tuning.,"I bought 2 collars, one for a border collie and another for a dalmatian. For the border collie, it worked great; no problems whatsoever.For the dalmatian, her collar would seem to spray randomly which confused the poor girl. It sprayed when she drank water, walked on gravel, and for no apparent reason. We adjusted the collar multiple times without much improvement. We switched the dogs' collars. Curiously, both collars seem only to malfunction when on the dalmatian but not the border collie.What finally helped was putting an address label over the microphone. This reduced its sensitivity and now it only sprays when she barks. It's been 2 months and we have a nice quiet bark free home. It also worked great to stop their barking when in car. They used to be bark-a-maniacs when we drive by other dogs. Now they just look with blissful silence. If you have barking dogs, this collar is worth a try."
4,works for one of my two dogs,"These collars were recommended to me by my veterinarian who uses them on her two dogs. I have two dogs: one standard poodle and one mini poodle yorkshire terrier mix. The collar works really well for my little dog who used to barked incessantly every time it was set out in the backyard. However, it does not seem to bother my big dog who barks much less frequently, but who can make quite a ruckus when a rabbit, squirrel or deer is in sight. I think the product is good and functions well, however, it may not work for all dogs."
1,Wish it worked,"For the first day this collar worked great. It startled my small dog when she barked and I really think she would have learned not to bark had the collar worked for more than a day. When we put it on her the next day, it simply didn't work. I was so disappointed. We thought perhaps it needed to be refilled but no,it just failed to work. I have requested another collar to be sent, I'd like to give it another try. Perhaps this one was defective."
4,Good but... no running,"This collar works just fine if your dog is fairly still. My dog likes to run wildly all over the yard and bark. The collar sprays out just fine, but because she is running, the spray doesn't go in her face. If she turns, it doesn't even hit her face at all. Haven't figured out how to make this work for us."
1,Doesn't even faze my dog,"I wanted to get something humane to quiet my dog (male lab.) It worked for maybe two days. He would start to bark and then be caught off guard by the spray and stop. Now it doesn't bother him at all.Keep in mind when buying this product, it doesn't work for all dogs and it's non-refundable, so you might be better off trying something else."
1,I didn't get what I ordered and it failed,"I've had great luck with the PREMIER brand of ""anti-bark"" collars. I used this one for about three weeks when it was new; then I didn't need it until one month ago. It didn't work. Turns out that this anti-bark system was made in China under the ""multivet-inter"" brand. My goof since I didn't realize that I hadn't gotten what I ordered."
2,Does not work unless it's a lower pitched bark.,"I have a 65lb sled dog who's breed is prone to bark a lot. His hair is trimmed short around his neck where the collar fits. The collar was fitted to allow for one finger looseness and it is pointed in the direction of his snout per the petsafe directions. There are no adjustments for pitch or sensitivity; just an on and off switch. The problem is that this collar only sprays when a lower pitch bark is detected. The collar does not pick up higher pitched barks or the constant ""yipping"" barks, but only the lower pitch barks which our dog does much less of."
4,Not for my dogs after all,"I love this product and for other people's dogs this will probably work excellent - our dogs however, learned how to bark to the side so the spray didnt hit them anymore."
1,Does not work,"We've purchased Petsafe products in the past and have been pleased with them. This item, however, was a big disappointment. It does not work, and even though we have all of the packaging, we can't return it because the citronella is considered a ""hazardous material."" Don't waste your money on this collar."
1,poor performance,"purchased two of these as I have 2 dogs. One of them never worked - I even purchased extra batteries, but that didnt work either. The other worked for a few days, and than got stuck n a continuious spray."
4,Humane and effective,"I purchased the GentleSpray collar mostly due to its humane method. After about two weeks of use, my 10 year-old dog Jack no longer barks when guests come over or when someone knocks on the door. However, being an older dog, he has a substantial amount loose neck skin; the device often became obscured by said skin, and the spray would not reach his snout. I had to tighten the collar everyday, since it loosened on its own fairly easily. But overall, it was a successful purchase, and I recommend this product to any owner whose dog has a slight barking habit."
4,worked great for us,"We bought two collars, one for each of our dogs. After a few times wearing them, now we pretty much just have to bring them out and the barking stops. It has even worked for our new 10mo. old puppy who gets really nervous and barks nonstop when people come over. We put it on him before they come in and it helps keep him calm. The only thing is one collar, after a month, doesn't work all the time. When our dog barks, the sprayer sticks on and gives a much longer spray than it initially did. Overall we are very happy with the collars."
4,Stops the chatter,"We always say our dog Samson likes to get the last word. We moved to an apartment from a house and all the new sounds were interesting to him. We worked with him for a couple weeks before purchasing the Anti-Bark Collar. During that time he still felt the need to 'woof' at every little sound and other dogs. After doing a lot of research on the best product we felt this one was the most humane and effective.The first time the collar sprayed him, he didn't know what had happened. He was so concerned with trying to solve his new problem that he forgot to bark again. We have found the collar to be very effective on the louder barks. He occassionaly does a little grumble barking but that's not too distracting. Overall we are very satisfied with the Anti-Bark Collar.FYISamson is a 30 lb black comfort doodle. He is all personality and this collar hasn't changed that. We didn't have to trim the fur around his neck, works great the way it is."
1,Didn't Even Phase Him,"I have a 9-year-old Pekingese who barks whenever a leaf blows by. This bark collar did not even phase him (and neither did the electronic zapping kind). It was definitely ""working"" because I could see the spray shooting out but my dog just kept on barking. Also, the spray runs out incredibly fast. It must be refilled several times per day. The entire can that it comes with lasted about 2-3 days before it was empty. Ridiculous. I will be returning this product. This product may be useful to train puppies before they assume crazy barking habits but for an older dog that is set in his ways, forget it."
1,My Doxy barked right through it!,"My Freckles, age 15 months didn't mind the smell of citrinella at all. She just barked like she normally does. The first day it seemed to be a deterent but as days went by she just barked and barked. She would smell like a candle when she came in."
2,Works Great but Major Flaw,"Initially we were ecstatic over this collar. When the first burst of citronella bloomed after our dachshund cut loose barking we all cheered...it stopped him immediately. Within one day the barking was completely controlled. He even refrained from barking when the collar was turned off - he must really hate the smell of citronella. We also got a sort of two for one special...when our other dachsund barked while standing next to the one wearing the collar, it went off. It will also discharge for certain pitches of whining. Unfortunately, if you leave the unit on it burns through a battery a day. The battery is a 6V which is not easy to find and costs around $4. We are hoping that this issue is due to our having a defective unit and that it can be exchanged for one that doesn't tear through batteries. Otherwise this is an expensive training program. In addition, now that the battery keeps dying, our dog is back to barking."
1,never works,"I have tried this collar repeatedly and it only works about 10% of the time, Certainly not enough to actually train a dog. It is either empty, clogged or the battery is dead when I try to work with my dog. By the time I troubleshoot all the probelms, I am too frustrated to work effectively with my dog. I hate this thing. And the battery alone is a joke! It seems to only last about an hour! Hate it, hate it, hate it."
2,Didn't really work,"Got this to use with a Shih Tzu puppy (8mos old) and the weight was probably too much for her. Also, I could never trigger the sprayer to shoot when I made noise beside it. We could smell it, so we know it activated at some point, but we could never tell when/why. This was disappointing."
5,Citronella Miracle Worker,"I have been telling everyone I know about the Gentle Spray collar. It works AMAZINGLY well. My dog used to howl and whine constantly, whether he was outside, inside or playing. It took him about 10 minutes to realize that the collar would spray him. I LOVE THIS THING!"
5,stop barking,"We moved from a house to an apartment. Our dog was not used to the traffic that apartments have, so he was barking constantly. We got a complaint letter from management about his barking. We thought we were going to have to get rid of him until This product was recommended to me by a friend. It is amazing. You put it on your dog, the first time he barked, the spray came out and it scared the hell out of him. He barked maybe 3 times more getting sprayed. And that was it. We only put the collar on when we leave the apartment. As soon as he sees the collar, he starts shaking."
1,Did not work,This product did not work at all. My dog kept barking. We went through a whole bottle of spray in one walk with no effect.
1,Did not stop my dog's barking,"This did nothing to stop my dog's barking. On the plus side, when she barked, it gave my house a lovely citronella scent."
2,It worked first but then...,"When we first got SpraySense we thought it was a big hit!: Our dog, Lab Mix, had learnt not to bark incessantly for a couple of months...until, she learned how to loosen the belt by pulling it and started to gnaw on the device! When the first one was destroyed, we ordered another one. Alas, our dog was too smart for it and remembered how to loosen the strap and destroy it again!I wish SpraySense came with a different type of strap where dogs can't loosen it!!"
1,It is no good!!,It worked for one week and then it stopped spraying. The dog was responding well to the training and then it stopped spraying. Now the barking is more than before we tried this. Terrible!
4,It works!,I have a brussels griffon/ schnauzer mix who is very barkative. Bought this collar and TADA no more barking! My only issue is that the collar is too long and it slides around his neck when it is set to the smallest adjustment.
4,Great at first.,"The citronella collar works great at first however, after a few days my dog decided that the spray emitted from the collar was something to try and catch, so he would bark and then bite at the spray over and over again. It would probably work better if my dog wasn't so playful all the time."
3,"Works, but not durable","I must say the product works. My boxer attacks the fence when the neighbor dogs are out, and this collar stops him in his tracks. The issue is these collars are not very durable. I've gone through two, neither of which lasted more than a month or so. Great results, but unfortunately the product just doesn't last. I'll be trying a different brand now. Also, the collar will still give one spray after it is switched to off. Its an issue with me because I turn the collar off when he comes inside so he can still be a watchdog."
3,It worked for awhile,it worked for the first few nights and now its not working so well it still scares him and makes him stop backing but when my puppy is freaking out it doesnt stop barking unless he has the shocker one on. we purchesd both a shocker one and spray one because i didnt want to shock him but we live in a small town and the dogs cant be barking all night long. so we switch off between the spray and the shock color.
1,Collar Has Only Sprayed Once,"My dog has had the collar on for the past several days. While he has barked numerous times, the collar has nly sprayed once. Prior to purchasing the Premier Gentle Spray collar, I used the Multivet Deluxe collar. I don't think it performed all that well either, but it did spray about 50% of the time when my dog barked and so it definitely worked better than the Premier one has so far. I will say that the Premier collar has been easier to fill and turn on/off than the Multivet one."
3,Worked great for 1 day...,"Seemed to be working great the first day. My dog did try to get the collar off by rubbing it on the ground, which lost the battery cover. But I put a piece of tape over it, no problem.The second day, I noticed that the citronella was seeping out. My poor baby! She must have been getting slightly sprayed for maybe an hour, and couldn't figure out why!I contacted Amazon for a refund (you cannot return this item in the mail) and they refunded my money, no questions asked.I DID order another one. It seemed to be working great at first, and my friend swears by it. My dog's bark is so shrill, it sets the alarm off in my house! I'm willing to try it again."
2,"works great to stop barking, when collar actually works","This collar works great to stop unwanted barking without harming your dog, however I have been through two of these collars in justa few months because the collars themselves are unreliable. The first one sprayed once, then stopped working. Amazon was great and sent a replacement even though I couldn't send the defective one back (the pressurized spray is classified as hazardous). The second one worked well for a few months but then just stopped spraying no matter what I did-refilled reservoir, changed battery. The spray started leaking out slowly. I give up, I'm not even going to bother calling Amazon for yet another one, but I might go to my local pet store to get one (different brand maybe!!) so that I can deal with a local store if I have this kind of problem again, but when the collar did work, the effect on my dog was immediate!"
1,does not work for more than 2 days,"I was excited to find an inexpensive spray collar, but you get what you pay for. Collar worked for only 2 days, Amazon generously sent me a replacement only to have it work for 2 days. They again refunded me and then I had to go buy a different brand at the pet store, it is still working, more than double the price, so I was disappointed."
2,"Worked well for a few weeks, now leaks","Even though it's obvious the physical quality of this product isn't top-notch (it's a little plastic box that a cheap strap goes around), I was satisfied with this product for a few weeks. It did very well in curbing the barking, more by confusing the dog than anything else. Sometimes it seemed to go off when it wasn't warranted (like when my small dog jumped on my lap), but overall I was satisfied.However, it now leaks the liquid solution, and a few hours after a refill it's empty again even if we weren't using it. This leaves a mess too. This product is too expensive to be so cheaply made. I would recommend looking for something more sturdy and reliable."
4,"Had three, two worked extremely well","For years we used two of these collars to keep our black lab and Tibetan Spaniel from barking all day (and night!). The collars we had worked perfectly. One day during the Daily Dog Wstling Match, one of the collars was chewed to pieces so we had to order a new one. The replacement came in and looked funny--as if it had been refurbished or cheaply manufactured. It worked for two days and then leaked citronella everywhere, even when the battery was removed. After reading similar, more recent reviews I got to thinking: I wonder if the manufacturer changed the way in which these collars are built? I'm scared to buy another one. We now just share the one we have between our dogs."
1,Disappointed,The microphone is not accurate. The collar sprays my dog when he shakes but not when he barks. Also the directions were very confusing must be read word for word or it takes twenty minutes to assemble. This was a waste of money.
2,Not for every dog,While I read some great reviews about this product working for other dogs.. as well as working well for a friend of mines dog.. It did nothing for my Great Dane. He didn't even so much as flinch as he got repeatedly sprayed in the face.
5,Great Resource,"This cookbook has quickly earned the hallmarks of a great cookbook: its pages are dog-eared and ingredient stained. I bake a lot for my friends, family and church and this cookbook is an all-around winner. The sour-cream chocolate cake is meant to be eaten late at night with a glass of ice cold milk. I have made the fresh fruit and southern pecan pound cakes to rave reviews. I have yet to find a bad recipe. This weekend I plan to make the gingerbread and I am sure I'll not be disappointed. Thank you Carole!"
3,Old publication repackaged,"This is a classic book for beginning chess players. Although it was in a nice cover, the book was not reprinted. The result is not particularly attractive."
4,A good all-around helicopter flight sim,"This is a well coded helicopter sim, a very realistic flight model can be selected, or novices can use a ""dummied down"" version to get their feet wet. There are plenty of missions to fly and includes a head-to-head multiplayer mode, or a scenario-based multiplayer mode. The graphics are very good, some complexity could be added, but all-around very good and very entertaining."
1,This is about the BAYWATCH soundtrack that I have heard.,I think that David Hasselhoff is not a very good singer and his music is not good at all. I think that you should not buy this CD. Do not even think about it. If you do you will regret it. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Thank you.
3,Nothing Special,"I looked forward to reading this book, but ended up being disappointed. The writers were very skilled at their craft, but I've certainly read much more meaningful, true dog stories. Perhaps it's because I'm involved in dog rescue, and some of our stories are either terribly happy, or terribly sad. Not the vanilla stuff like this book."
3,"Moderately amusing, moderately interesting...","...but nothing to write home about. I finished it. It was mildly entertaining. The humor seemed a bit dated, as you might expect from a 50 year old book. That's about all I have to say about it."
5,La Divina reigns supreme!,"I guess the greatest singers, critics and conductors would neither work with nor praise a ""highly overrated"" singer. Zeffirelli spoke of an era A.C. and B.C. --> Before Callas and After Callas. The fantastic Belcanto-Revival we owe to her, she cleared the path for all the great ones following her: Sutherland, Sills, Horne, Gruberova etc. But loving Callas doesn't mean one should listen to her only. This collection is supreme, showing why Callas still reigns supreme as a soprano sfogato in the tradition of Malibran and Pasta, Bellini's and Donizetti's muses. And if those ignorant Callas-Bashers knew ANYTHING they'd know that both Pasta and Malibran were adored for being ""imperfect""! Bellini wrote his Norma for Pasta, Donizetti his Anna Bolena. What this must have been like we hear in Callas and later on in Sills who recorded the most complete Belcanto-operas. Buy this collection and be swept away by a passion, an ardour that is more than just singing: It was her life!"
3,Murky,"I have to agree with the reviewers complaining about the sound quality on these CD's. I first discovered Debussy's piano music through these recordings when I was left my grandfather's record collection and I was obsessed. I bought this hoping to get back that vinyl magic but this is a murky compressed sounding thing, with none of the charm it should have. Boo."
2,What's the point?,"I found this book while randomly browsing amazon, and I must say, I'm disgusted with the thought. If you don't like the mild darkness implied in the nursery rhymes, then simply don't read them to your kids! There's no need to mangle classic rhymes -- I see that approach as disrespectful to the originals."
1,"kinder, gentler world?",since when do we wnat to fill our kids' heads with stories that hte world is kind and gentle. just by reading the summary of this book i am disgusted. classic nursery rhymes serve a purpose for children and to change them into sickingly sweet poems is a diservice and a disgrace.
5,As close as you can get to reality,"Delta Force is one of the best war games I have come across. The environment is beautiful, the missions and enemies are realistic and you don't need fancy hardware to run it. Select your weapons carefully and start your mission. Once the shooting starts, the positional sounds makes you wet your pants the first time. I almost froze when I met enemies up close (but finished them off eventually). The controls are easy to use and you'll soon be a ruthless killing machine. That's when you're ready for some multi-player action. This game sure is a must have!"
1,A Poetic Failure,"A very disappointing collection. It is interesting to note that Daisy Goodwin is the creator of a number of British television lifestyle programmes including one called ""Bring Your Husband To Heel"". Perhaps it isn't surprising therefore that someone whose idea of a loving relationship encompasses the use of spousal dog training should compile a book of love poetry that is about as romantic as Canine Distemper."
1,not huxley's best,"this novel was, in my opinion, not very good. it smacks of aristocratic pretension. i did not like nor could i find my self sympathetic with any of his hollow, flat characters. which really bothers me very, because i'm a huge huxley fan."
4,Fun,I recommend this book. It is a fun read that is perfect for cold day. For the price it is a must for every kindle owner
3,Wrong book,"I was given the wrong title and wanted LITTLE HEATHENS rather than THE HEATHENS. Nothing wrong with the book, but I haven't even looked at it except to find out it's not the one I wanted."
2,great support; poor material choice,This brace was recommended to me by a physical therapist when I was having problems with the tendons on the bottom of my foot. This helped give me better support while the tendons healed. As other reviewers have said it is difficult to get off and on but for me this was a small price to pay to ensure that my foot healed properly.I am very disappointed in the material. I hadn't used the brace for a couple years. My foot started bothering me again so I tried to put it on and I discovered that the material that wraps around the front of the foot had degraded. It has some sort of rubber/stretchy material and it has turned into a gooey mess. I am disappointed that the brace now has to be thrown away.
2,ankle brace,I had a severe sprain from playing hoops and was unable to walk for 2 weeks and I am still suffering 3 months later. Doctor said 1 more month of therapy. I was hoping this brace would reduce the pain as compared to my aircast and allow me to do more. I don't think that is the purpose of the brace (reducing pain when moving). To me it seems a mild way to brace up ankle and prevent rollovers--- Next time i would want something with a much tighter wrap around the ankle.
1,What a piece,"This printer is possibly the biggest hunk of garbage ever manufactured. We have suffered it for a couple of years simply because we rarely have to print anything. However, those rare occasions are each memorable by the bloody battle we have to wage to get this rubbish to work. When you turn it on, the first thing the monstrosity does is begin to shake and rattle and rumble until the table it's sitting on nearly comes apart. Then it starts printing, all right...the printer test page, over and over and over again. That's pretty much all you get. Don't even think about trying to print a pdf. The scanner doesn't even work. This pile of trash is so bad that probably the only place you'll be able to find one is at a landfill. Do yourself a favor and leave it there, where it belongs."
4,Eyes of the beholder,"Kids love LOVE love these transformers, Grandparents think "" a thing of beauty, not perhaps"" but everything that lights up the eyes of a grandson is a beauty. Hours of entertainment. Highly recommend. I am not sure how the kids figure them out so quickly!!!!!!!"
3,Dated Text,"Have read most of my Uris as a teen and into my 20's, and he deserves great credit for teaching me about the holocaust and other historical moments that he weaves into his fiction. That is the case here as well. Having said that, perhaps I am older and more sophisticated, but the writing definitely reflects a Coldwar 60's attitude, and the dialogue a bit patriotic/ham fisted. Sometimes it made me squirm. The subject is great, and the characters well placed and fleshed out. The soviets do seem like a creepy bunch, and although I am sure their nature is exaggerated, Uris gets across the tragedy of soviet post-war occupation."
5,An Excellent Personalized Look Into History,"Armageddon is an excellent description of post-war germany that really gives a feeling of what is was like after the war. Though at times there were a lot of characters to keep track of, they all had interesting enough backgrounds to make them distinct. Uris was probably a little bit biased, he tried to show all sides of the Berlin situation. I found it difficult to put down."
1,Worthless,"I bought this book hoping to get insight on whether or not to train to be a special education teacher, what I got was a rather long rant."
4,Roger Eno Expands Romantic Era From English Base,"If we read nineteenth-century lit and then listen to its music, we come away confused by the disparity. While the literature hovered squarely over Northwest Europe's very own melancholy and mystery, damp and dark, the music might just as well flit away into sugar and sweetness--listen to Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" for a perfect example of the schizophrenia. Roger Eno's music, however, is a continuance of the Romantic or Victorian Era's literature. Swimming is all but devoid of Eno's typical classical ensemble instrumentation, but the deep, romantic, NWEuro mood is present in droves. Swimming, as with all of Eno's output, is decisively mature emotionally, obviously British, humble, and peaceful. Eno is touching with Swimming, but with emotion 100% sugar-free. It's such a shame that you're always pointed to the New Age Ninnies section when you ask for Roger Eno. . . ."
4,Sweet-dreamy pops and joyous R&R in the late 50s,"Despite located in Jackson, Ms., Ace Records released many New Orleans R&B and R&R sides. The song list above tells you that you can hear 4 of wild rocker Frankie Ford's hits, 2 of Huey Smith's party tunes and Joe Tex's rare one inspired by the Coasters. And then from 7th to 13th of the list are sung by a pop star Jimmy Clanton, the most successful man in Ace. Billy Vera, a music-historian singer of 'At This Moment' fame, writes the liner-notes written in very tiny letters. It's not so bad a compilation."
3,Good for the price,"Good price for my used book. Received in a timely manner, not super fast, but before promised. Book was in decent condition for a used book - edges were bent and rolled and highlighting in book too. BUT for the price, it was a good purchase and workable. I would buy from them again."
1,No support?,"I bought this software a few months ago but didn't get around installing it until today. When I tried to register the software I got the message that the software is no longer supported! I was asked to call an 800 number to get a discount on an upgrade. This is the first time I ever ran across a name-brand software package that discontinues support before the software is even one year old! While I may still use the software I found it appalling that the publisher of this software dares to force customers to pay for an ""upgrade"" immediately upon installation of software that they just purchased."
1,Very bad,"I have had problems with this phone too. One headset has died and the beeps that everyone mentions are a very big problem. I bought this because I work from home and the speaker phone option on the headset was a must have, but everyone on the phone hears random beeping! I spent hours on the phone with ATT customer support and they had no idea how to fix it."
1,You don't always get what you pay for,"My husband and I have had this phone for about a year. When we first got it, we discovered that it clashes with our Vonage voicemail. We cannot check our messages on the actual answering machine which means we never know about missed calls until we get around to checking our E-mail. Our problem now is that one handset you can barely dial with now, you have to mash the buttons repeatedly and sometimes they get stuck! The spare charger is now on the fritz as well. We only began to use it and the spare phone because of our problems with the original handset. Looks like we're going to fork over the money for a new phone soon and it will NOT be this one again."
2,"Sorry, not that impressed.","If you are a voice major, then buy this set. It is more instructional perhaps in that sense. But for true enjoyment? It is just not for me.Take the money you would spend on this set and buy the LA DIVINA CALLAS set. Well worth the money if you want to hear the divine Miss Callas. There are also numerous EMI classic sets out there for her opera performances that I think would be much more of an enjoyable listening experience than the Julliard recordings."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This movie is a cross between The Night of the Living Dead and the Blair Witch Project. I, however, was very disappointed after watching this movie. This movie did not have anything new to offer the genre. The movie itself is broken up into three separate stories, so there really is not much to plot development or character development. It has a low budget feel to it, which sometimes can add to the movie. This is not the case for this movie. The zombies are not scary at all. In fact, they move slower than a snail. Someone in a coma could outrun them. I'm not sure what the purpose of this movie was since it did not offer anything new."
1,i love horror films!!,"did critic's comments on ""dog soldier"" and ""28days"" etc. fooled loyal horror fans? watch this and you'll be fooled again. occassionally i wouldn't mind zombie flicks, until now! at first i thought it was the british accent and the bland cinematography, but as the film progressed i realised the only thing that has gotten me this far was the hopes it might get better. the ending confused me alittle- is this film about zombies or deranged psychopaths?i depend on critics commentary to decide on a good flick, but it seems that british films, australian films and european films alike tend to exagerate on their merits! If you like convincing gore and acting, settle with high budget films. (worse zombie film ever!)"
1,"Uh, NO. Don't buy it.Or the hype.","I just finished watching this flick mere seconds ago, and I have to say...what a waste. I'm going to go ahead and say it-I did not care for those two retarded looking serial killers. They ruined the whole movie! I know things are bad during a zombie invasion, but why kill a good thing?Avoid this at all costs! I am going to sell mine asap though I 'd rather break it if not for these recession times."
1,Absolutely Horrid,"It's pretty rare that I am THIS dissapointed by a film, let alone a zombie movie. I didn't think this was going to be a classic, brilliant film, but I at least expected to be entertained. The acting is weak, and there are no truly likeable characters. The editing is a complete mess, jumping wildly from one group of characters you don't care about to another group of characters you don't care about. The drama seems forced, and the message that men are the monsters, not the zombies, seems tacked on in the third act in a clumsy attempt to give this movie a sense of purpose.I LOVE zombie movies, but this is the only one in my collection of over 30 that I will never watch again."
1,where were the zombies????,"If you hated Blair Witch Project then you will hate this movie... if you liked BWP... oh who the hell am i kidding, the best part of this movie was the art on the front and back cover.. oh, and the art on the dvd itself... oh kay, i get the low budget and independant angle...(if you want that in your Zombieness then get yourself a copy of Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things!!!) but maybe i never should have watched George R's Diary of the Dead... which freaking ROCKS and is his best yet!!!!ANYHOW... this movie is more about MAN and how they behave in a Zombie world...or better yet how man's insanity is allowed to go unchecked in a world without law enforcement!!! same yourself some cash and skip this movie... unless you buy it used or you run across it in a bargan bin for under $6.00!!!!"
3,It's okay.,"I think I read a review that said something along the lines of ""this is what 28 Days Later should have been"". Uh, no. It is not remotely in the same league as that movie. However, it's not one of the worst either."
1,The Worst Zombie Film I've Ever Seen,"As a huge fan of zombie films I can definitively state this is the worst zombie film I have ever seen. Shot on what looks like a $500 budget this film follows around groups of people in post-zombie infested England in a faux-handheld camera-live style popularized by films like The Blairwitch Project and Cloverfield. As such, expect to get nautious as the camera jerks around constantly while people are busy arguing with each other or running from what have to be the slowest zombies in film history. There are also numerous scenes shot in the dark where the camera serves as the only source of light....yawn. Been there done that in equally bad films like Quarantine. There is no character development, basically no plot, and nothing to keep the viewer remotely interested in what happens. When this film ends you will be pissed that you spent 1 hour and 20 minutes watching this garbage."
2,Lame film with only one decent aspect,First off both the trailer and box art are very misleading. This film is not for the true zombie fan. There are no hordes of flesh craving zombies looking to devour the cast. The only reason for the 2 stars was because it did handle the human drama of an apocalyptic environment. Save your money if you want a zombie movie.
1,Zombie Diaries - don't bother,"Lame. Boring. Pathetic. DON'T BELIEVE THE QUOTED REVIEWS! Where are the zombies? On the few occasions, mostly in the dark, that we see any, they create a new standard for slow as they barely move. One could just walk around shooting them in the head with no threat to life and limb. The characters make no effort to fortify their locations; they idiotically go out at night to kill them; a few somehow manage to get themselves caught by zombies in broad daylight; the characters do none of the things one would expect in such a horrible situation other than argue with each other. Mostly we see people looking for zombies or just talking to each other. To top it off the gore factor is missing. Whoever did the reviews quoted on the case must have been paid or maybe watched a different movie. Tiresome. Irritating. Stupid."
4,enlightment of young person's abilty to accept responsiblity,This is not the first book I read by this author--I felt the book was picturesque in the way the author painted the scenery-I felt as if I could close my eyes and become that young man trying to come of age without wanting or needing to become educated--as he said I don't need to know about those things. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to stay connected to the family and still become the good hijito that the person feels he or she should become.
3,Sills Gives Wrong Thrills,"Massenet's voluptuos score was written with the easy virtuosity of Sybil Sanderson in mind. The role calls for a free, bright upper register and power to project the voice over an orchestra in full-cry. Madame Sills is enthusiastic, and has the notes in her voice, but the sound is forced, curdled and cold. The climactic top C at the end of Act 1 is an Everest for any soprano but Sills ascent is occluded by a wide vibrato and steel shredding tone. The e flat at the end of the mirror aria is blood curdling - for all the wrong reasons. Given that Thais is a courtesan we should have been hearing a voice of youthful attractiveness not matronly determination. Milnes is in sonorous voice and characterises effectively but Gedda sounds, like Sills, too mature for the role. The Choral singing and orchestral sound are rousing rather than subtle. Maazel finds much drama in the score but little of the febrile eroticism that the score contains."
3,"Better than not having a full recording, but...","Beverly Sills was way beyond her prime when she essayed this role for the Metropolitan and the San Francisco Opera, and though it is far and away the most complete recording of this opera her wobbly notes in the lovely ""l'amour est une vertu rare"" are nothing short of painful. She does do a great hysterical laugh (which dissolves into hysterical sobs) to conclude the first Act, but although Thais has usually been sung by ""singing actresses"" (like Mary Garden) the role deserves to be performed on disc by a Renee Fleming in her prime.Fortunately, the rest of the cast is in fine voice: Sherrill Milnes does a nice job with Athanael (particularly in the dramatic ""Alexandrie"" aria), and Nicolai Gedda is a charming Nicias."
5,carnelian ring is a winner!,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD5A3C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis is a fabulous little ring. The color is true, with both red and some orange. It fits beautifully and looks great on the hand (I use it for my middle finger). I needed a carnelian ring to match a necklace and earrings I had just purchased as a gift; guess I will have to get another ring 'cause I am keeping this one!"
5,Love it!,I wear this ring in place of my engagement ring when the situation calls for a less ostentatios option. It's comfortable and I love it.
2,This ring is not red!,"Received this ring, unlike the picture shown here at amazon the ring was more of a rusty orange color and not at all like the deep red shown in this picture. Also the customer service from Gem Avenue is terrible!"
5,"""Coolie!""","Though I haven't gotten this toy yet, my friend has, and it is totally awsome. You can play with it as a car, or as a fancy limosine. The fact that it's pink certainly makes it distinct, and all of it's features are perfect."
4,Ordinary Zen,"There are quite a few long reviews on this book that should suffice for a detailed information without my two cents added. I will, however, note that this book lacks much of the glamor so often attributed to Zen masters. 'Shobogenzo Zuimonki' is plain and straight-forward, and Dogen does not lead one to indulge in wild, philosophical explorations. Rather, he points to a quite ordinary and much more 'down-to-Earth' Zen, which is refreshingly simple."
5,Reminder,"I love this cd so much! I first heard ""why"" in a car on the way home from youth group and fell in love. so i went home, got online and bought the cd. Nichole is an amazing lyricist and whenever i feel lost, all i have to do is put in this cd and it reminds me what i mean to God, and that even diehard christians like Nichole Nordeman feel like they have lost their relationship with God at times too. This is a cd every christian should have. and even if you aren't christian, i can guarantee that this cd with inspire you!"
3,hurts my hands,i tried these to strengthen my hands while at the office and after a few days my hands were almost literally bruised. it would be nice if they included some sort of plastic or rubber grip on the handles because they can really dig into yoru planms and fingers. i fixed the problem by wrapping some foam and duct tape around the handles but for the price i think these should include some sort of comfort feature.
3,"Tight, but not straight.","I only ordered one set, so maybe my issue is only with this particular couple. When I squeeze them to put them on a bar the rings do not stay aligned and it takes a lot of wiggling to get them on at all, not to mention the complete pain it is to slide them down to the weight. Once they're on though, they have a death grip on the bar. I just received these two days ago, so hopefully after a lot of useage they'll straighten out and be more managable. But if they remain in the current state for much longer I'll be throwing them away."
4,"Great, but some flaws","I got this product quick to replace the original locking system for my weights. So far these are working out great. Unfortunately, one of the locks actually doesn't work, so I might have to get another one. With the exception of the one that slides off with the wind, the other 3 I bought stays on without any problem."
1,Garbage Collar,I have been lifting for over 30 years and these are the worst collars I have ever seen or purchased. Good luck getting them on. Really bad design.
1,Don't Fit,The pair I received didn't have concentric circles when squeezed. One barely made it onto my Olympic bar with excessive force. The other wouldn't go no matter how hard I tried. Buyer beware.
2,Surprised and disappointed,"I have to say that I was sadly disappointed with the book. I am an aspiring writer and bought the book because of my mentor. The story has a good plot and I am familiar with Richmond and Williamsburg in Virginia, which is the setting for the book. But a part of the way into the book I had to stop reading. The scenes and words were trashy and extremely sexual. I thought to myself, if this is what it takes to be a writer, then I am not a writer. I tore the book up and threw it away. If it had been written without all the extremely sexual details, it would still be a great story, but as it is, it was not for me."
2,Spend the extra & get something that works!,"Didn't kill the fleas, even though the house was throughly treated with it!Used another brand & it worked incredibly well."
5,Pure Awesomeness!,"This thing is so good and I'm so happy I discovered it that I'm gonna stock up on it just in case it disappears. Nice price too. I was getting so tired, literally, cleaning the interior side of the windshield of my cars that I had to do something. Discovered it on Amazon, never going back to Windex.In case you're wondering...each can holds 19oz (wow!) of this awesome product."
2,"Is ""TexasStyle"" a new variant of this product? I've enjoyed French's Chil-o mix for years and love the stuff.","Is this ""Texas Style"" a new version of French's Chil-o mix? Did they change the receipe? I have enjoyed Chil-o mix for years and love the stuff. I made a huge pot (10 packs) and no one could eat it. Just to damned hot and spicy. What happened?"
2,"Hardware is ok w.r.t. price, software is awful","Bought it for < $30+tax. Installing the software is awful. The printer driver does not work with a simple installation process although the scanner driver does. I downloaded the ""latest"" version, it did not fix the problem but then the scanner user interface completely disappeared. After install/uninstall/reboot > 10 times with a specific sequence, and including manually editing registry a few times, finally, both the printer and scanner drivers are fully operational, although I still don't have the scanner user interface. I would not expect an average user to get it work if all drivers were not installed right the first time. After all, I decided to keep this printer/scanner since hardware works as expected, and I can use other software to operate the scanner. Customer support is reasonable through the live-chat agent but when the software is so buggy, overall you get limited help."
1,Buyer Beware,"I downloaded the full version of DVD Complete from Dazzle's website ($$$$$). After numerous feeze-ups as I tried to add small clips to this movie making/burning software, I finally called tech support (several times). Nice people, but they admitted this is a new product and not really fully de-bugged, and I've never been able to get it to work. I dont know what other software can do the job better, but this one is definitely not the one, at least with this user (Windows XP user). It seems this whole family of software generally is where CD burning software was a few years ago -- lots of headaches. So the problem may be systemic, and not confined to DVD Complete alone."
1,The Worst Usage of Money Ever,"Please, please do not buy this software. You may wonder why the company that made it went broke. Well, it's because of how utterly horrible this thing is. I finally was able to get my video onto my computer. Whenever I opened it, it crashed after 6 minutes. Video randomly merges with images. This is the worst program ever written. A paraplegic gorilla randomly flailing about on the ground in some god-forsaken rainforest has most likely written a better program than this one. Please, for my sake and especially for yours, do not buy this."
5,Chumash,"I have found the insight and information contained in this book tremendously valuable in learning and gaining a little understanding into the Torah. Each year as I go through it I glean a little more knowledge. So much stuff, I will be learning from it as long as I read it."
5,A New Torah Student,"I have recently joined a Beit Midrash. After several months of borrowing Chumash, I decided to purchase my own. This one was a gift ""In Memory of___"" but unfortunately it looks as though it was not read. I purchased it used but it is in 'like new' condition. I read it daily."
1,Emotionally Abusive,"This book posits the idea that gays are such because they failed to bond with their same sex prior to puberty -- with the load of blame heaped on the same-sex parent. Whether this is the cause of homosexuality is not my concern. This book invalidates homosexuals as if there were something wrong with being gay. Moberley says that later-life bonding with the same sex (platonically) can change one spontaneously into a heterosexual.I find her concepts to be emotionally abusive because she wants to rewrite the personalities of homosexuals, as if they had a mental disorder. Her treatment methods are immoral. If you are a gay who is conflicted, get some professional therapy to help you discover and accept yourself rather than being tortured by religious bigotry like this."
5,Great Go Diego,"Our two and four year old boys both love this one. The feature is the twice the length of a regular show and they love the dinosaur theme. They also have learned more about dinosaurs by watching! There are also two bonus shows on the DVD that they have seen before, but they enjoyed them just the same."
5,My son LOVES this DVD!,"My son would watch this DVD - and the ""Meet Diego"" DVD - on a loop if we let him."
5,Jake 4 and Ella 1 LOVE this video!,"My kids love the video. My [...] stomps, jumps and claps with Dora, Diego and Alicia. They love animals and dinosaurs so this video is perfect for them. They are big Dora and Diego fans!"
5,Great product!,"I bought one of these to hold my Nalgene water bottle and found it to be so much more useful.The product is easily attachable to any molle gear and makes a great all purpose pouch. I've even put it on my belt and kept it handy for situations where I need a place to put things that I either wouldn't want in my pocket or couldn't fit in my pocket, like when my daughter needs a place to put the candy she gets at a parade, for example.The construction of the product is exactly what you would expect from Maxpedition. The material is heavy duty and the stitching is perfect. There are no loose strings or production errors.For those that use Nalgene bottles, this product is great for those, but I recommend the wide mouth over the narrow. The cap of the narrow mouth bottle sticks up a little bit."
5,Combat Ready,"The Maxpedition Drop Pouch is truly combat ready. It folds out much bigger than you would expect. It is perfect for all those loose items you may need to quickly store while in any multitude of situations. The nice benefit is, if you no longer need the storage, it rolls up into a compact, low-profile bundle that you will not even notice on your belt or LBE. A great addition to any gear set. The uses of this item are endless. As others have stated, the non-shooter can use it for metal detecting, artifact hunting, or even just carrying dog treats for your furry friend while out on a walk. No matter your particular situation, you will not be disappointed with this item."
2,Size may vary,This is not the standard dump pouch that you would expect to get. It is very small and requires Molle space avalible. Don't buy unless you want a smaller pouch.
1,NOT European Nutella. Same old USA/Canadian version,"Not the European Nutella that was specified..its from canada, in the same plastic jar Costco sells, for over twice the price. Ripoff!"
1,Awful service and support destroys promise of product,"I received the WRONG CD in the box -- apparantly an earlier edition that did not allow for drop and drag editing or adding of audio, as specified in advertising and on the box. The manual included did not match the screens and options which appeared when I loaded my software.You would think this problem would be rather simple to solve. But it's not. Simply cannot contact Dazzle about it! Called their non-toll free help line, and was on hold for an hour before I gave up. Dazzle did not respond to my e-mail. Too bad they don't care more about their customers. Product has promise, but when you can't even get an answer to a simple question, that promise remains unfulfilled."
3,Good if you want your child to GUESS read,"I thought this book would be great but I was wrong. It has about six sentences in the whole book. Almost all of them are: The fox ____ on the box. The filler words are jumped, played, sat, ate, etc. The word ""ate"" is a sight word so they don't even sound it out. A reader that can read words with ed at the end are too far along to be reading a book with all the other words being the same on every page. A beginning reader will not know the ed ending and if you tell them then they know the whole book since it's almost the same on every page. This book is lame. Check out my much better review of BOB books. I reviewed set 3."
2,"Good flexibility, not so much on the edge","I have been a fisherman for about 18 years and have spent a buck or two on fillet knives. My other Gerber knives are fantastic, which disappointed me when I had to sharpen this knife after cleaning 3 walleye. The flexibility on this knife is fantastic, but it seems like it can not hold a good edge. (In case you are wondering, no I am not a noob my wusthof knives are used daily and are sharpened to a razors edge.)"
1,Do not buy.,The clasps on the vest will not stay tight. As soon as you start to move around the vest comes loose and begins to bounce around. Very uncomfortable having 20 pounds bounce around your body when you are trying to workout. Huge disappointment for the price.
3,It was okay,"It was okay, but feels cheap when I put it on. Feels like the weights are gonna come off if i run too fast or move around too much."
3,"One to flip through to enjoy, and maybe pass along","It's a good overall book on a variety of objects and items. The diagrams are simple enough, as well as the level of language used to describe or tell a story. I think this might be more for someone starting out in Origami, or someone who'd like to just relax and do simple folding.I did not find this engaging enough to want to keep in my library, and am passing it along to my young nephews (early pre-teens). As for comments about the front cover picture, it is not included as a project, but some pictorial information is posted on one page."
