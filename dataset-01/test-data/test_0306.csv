1,Overrated,This game is getting rave reviews from many gaming critics but I have not idea why. There is absolutely nothing innovative about the gameplay. The story is confusing and nonexistent. Replay value isn't great since mulitplayer is rather uninventive and mindless. This game has extremely steep hardware requirements so if you want to run the game at high resolutions you'd better have a pretty powerful videocard (6800gt-7800gtx) . If you're a fanboy you'll probably not recommend my review but if you haven't purchased this game I'm truly against getting this before it hits the bargain bin. Be patient and wait for Call of Duty 2 or try Quake 4.
3,Entertaining but short,"I enjoyed this game with the following caveat: It's too short. The game play is well done and fun. It offers some interesting variations on the Quake/first-person shooter genre. The story line is a little trite, however. The ""Ring"" element seems forced and contrived. For a spooky ""Ring"" like game, check out the Fatal Frame series."
2,disappointed,"For some reason this game has been way over rated by some of the game sites. All the game has going for it is some good fire fights, no story to speak of, 3 enviornments we've seen several times that look terribly unfimished and generic at best.The game is also extreamly easy to beat, set at the highest level for a reasonable gaming expierence. No comparison to Half Life 2, Far Cry or Doom 3, not even close to being in the same league. The game looks like it's half finished and corporate said ""let's get it to market"", could have used alot more thought and creative input.It quickly becomes very repetive."
2,Where is the online feature???,"As an elementary school teacher, I was excited about this product, but I am finding two things extremely annoying. It attempts to register online everytime the appliction starts, but the website which it attempts to reach does not exist. Also, all of the online support/library is nonexistent, which was one of the features which prompted me to by this software. That's why this product is defective until this problem is corrected. I expected more from Simon and Schuster!"
4,A good pictorial introduction to the temple,"This is a well illustrated guide to the temple that was in Jerusalem. The history, rituals, feasts, festivals, and furnishings are all covered. The significance of the temple today is also examined. Anybody who needs an introduction to the subject of the temple should read this book. However, the reader will have to do his own research to learn about lesser known facts, such as the detailed appearance of cherubim, or the meaning of the tabernacle pattern. But overall, it is a good starting place to learn about the temple referred to in the pages of the Bible."
1,Melted and burned my cat's fur off!!,"I purchased 3 collars. One was lost immediately--not shocking as that is how things go with kitty collars.However, the other two developed a horrible issue. My cats are indoor only and have never had any issue with their collars before. However, the plastic on these collars melted, burned their skin and fused with chunks of hair so that my two medium hair kitties had chunks of fur missing.It was traumatic and upsetting--you should investigate your product and why the plastic would melt on a normal indoor cat.We have since switched back to Red Dingo brand collars--which are great. Never had any issue with their plastic melting!"
5,X-MEN - BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL - SPECIAL EDITION,IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE VERY BEST X-MEN SERIES TO DATE. IT CONTAINS ONE OF THE MOST MASSIVE STORYLINES WITHIN THE X-MEN UNIVERSE. ALMOST ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE VILLAINS AND HEROES APPEAR IN THIS CLASSIC OF CLASSICS. X-MEN FANS WILL BE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THIS ONE. DO NOT SKIP OVER THIS ONE.
1,Don't waste your money !!!!!,"First of all, I expected a better story. The plot stunk. The character of Pylocke was messed up, they didn't get her character right. They didn't even get the orginal voice for Magneto, they had a different guy. Apocalypse's plan was pretty stupid, he wanted to play God - he is a jerk. Wolverine and Sabretooth's fights should have been more realistic to their character's - they locked each other in a small room to fight and when they came out, there was no scraches or blood on either of them, when really they would both be a bloody mess. The Professor is standing at the end of the episode, when he can't do that. I really can't stand this episode, it is the worst one ever made. If I were you I would go buy any other episode but this. Don't waste your money !"
5,super bad,"Not sure of what to write but , this lightsabre made my day. I needed it to go along with my costume. It was everything I wanted it to be."
1,Pillsbury's Best 1000 Recipes: Best of the Bake-off Collection,"My assumption of this book was that it was an up-to-date edition, not from 1959. The entire cover was missing from the book, front and back, the binding was slit down the center and was barely held together and the pages were extremely yellowed. In the bookseller's defense, it said the book's condition was ""acceptable"" and when they responded to my email, they were very fair in returning the purchase price to me. I attempted to give the book to a thrift store, and they said it was something that they would not be able to accept as it was falling apart.Because the bookseller was fair in returning my purchase price, I would continue to use them, and give them a 4 star rating for fairness, but the book itself gets a ""1"". This has taught me to research an item prior to buying it. Also, had I known the date of the book, I would not have purchased it..I was looking for a book more up-to-date."
5,Best children's book out there!,Princess Briana is a wonderful book! It's truly inspiring and I think that all young girls should read it. It has a really good message that's relatable to all ages. And the quality of the book is truly exceptional!!
1,"Hogwash, drivel - mindless and worthless",This has to be a joke. Don't waste your money on the worthless self-agrandizement. The author has the weakest credentials and is unable to write a coherent chapter. Pitiful publication!
3,A little more difficult than others in same catagory,"I don't like this book as much as some others I have bought. The stories are more difficult. Print is small. After having several ""beginners"" Spanish books, it was hard for me to believe that this is for ""beginners."""
4,First Spanish Reader,"I like the book and the stories. I bought it for my daughter to learn both languages(her English is sufficient) as we are not English nor Spanish native speakers. The only thing missing in the book is a simple table of Spanish pronunciation. That would be a great help for a beginner. Other than that, the book is very good!"
5,Absolutely LOVE IT!,"This book is a great way of learning new words in context. What I love about it is the proverbs section, it is amazingly interesting. The stories are short and very funny and meaningful. If you are studying Spanish this book is a must for those who want to learn new words."
4,good reader,"I'm a real beginner, and this is a great help in putting my little bit of knowledge in context. I have to cover the facing (English) page because my eyes tend to wander, but that's easy. I look up a lot of words. If I look up enough, maybe I'll know Spanish by the end of the book."
5,Excellent and fun book. I enjoyed the history covered here.,"Excellent and fun book. I enjoyed the history covered here and the exciting way Mr Maury discovers, because of the biblical passage referencing it, the paths in the seas(Psalm 8:8). Great for kids and adults alike."
3,Learning Organizations: Developing Cultures for Tomorrow's Workplace,"I didn't receive the published year requested of this item to provide an accurate rating. I received an earlier version of the item in which I donated the book after brief perusing through it. From what I summarize the book is composed of a collection of opinion essays from various organizational leaders in the country. There may be some lessons to learn from their opinions but in a nutshell it is just that opinions from what has been learned in the field of learning organizations. On a different note, Although I was not able to use the book but I did received it in good condition."
1,too sharp edges,"I didn't put this collar on my cat. I'd bought it because the other collar had rubbedand created a sore under her neck, so I was looking for a very narrow lightweight collar. However,this cord is clamped with two metal fasteners that have rough edges--plus the glued end of thecord is sharp. So I'm just throwing it out rather than chance it."
1,gets loose all by itself - not recommended,I love the look of this collar and the idea is great that it pulls loose when/if it gets caught on something so the cat can get away BUT I find that it comes loose on its own!! I bought two and they both have the same problem. I have to re-tighten it twice a day which obviously makes it useless. I'm tossing them in the garbage and going back to the other kind I had.
5,My Cats Love These Collars,"I have a persian that is prone to getting matts in his fur, and a smart and feisty siamese who has not tolerated any other collar before, and was able to get most of them off. These super thin collars, however, have been working wonderfully. It doesn't seem to be matting my persian's fur nearly as badly (it still rubs a bit, but with the daily brushing and petting around the neck, it really isn't a problem) and my siamese can't tell that it's on her except for the tags jingling. I haven't seen her scratch at it at all.They were easy to adjust, not too loose and not too tight. They look great, and really do look more like a necklace than a tacky cat collar. I would recommend these to a normal cat collar any day."
5,By far my favourite so far.,"Straightforward and very, very educational. First book that I've read all the way through in a long time. Doesn't use any dificult werds."
4,My Daughter LOVES this!,"I bought this and 3 other CD's in Spanish for my daughter, who is not latina and has not had any true exposure to Spanish. She absolutely adores this CD more than the others and insists that I play it in the car ALL THE TIME. Since I studied Spanish and got my MA from the Univ. of Puerto Rico, I don't mind one bit! :-) I also love how much the marimba and mallet percussion is used. There is a great blend of fast and slow paced music."
4,Great CD (less of a sing-along more for quiet time),"This was a great buy for just $6 and as others point out, the voices of both adults and children are quite beautiful. This CD, however, is less of a CD to sing along with and more of one to play during quiet time or nap time. Classic folklore songs that brought a lot of memories!"
1,[No 0 star rating] An Unbelievably Stupid Film,"Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!Stupidity not worthy of further commentary."
3,Length slips...but fixable.,"We like these collars a lot, mostly because the cats don't seem to be bothered by them nearly as much...and therefore don't pull them off. We've had one successful removal, but that's a huge improvement over every other model we've tried. There is one significant problem: the metal ""sliders"" can easily move if the cat tugs on the collar. This expands the collar more and more, until it's drooping off the cat. It's billed as a safety feature, but I don't see it that way. Our solution was simply to 'tighten' the metal sliders in a vice once we'd gotten the collar to the perfect length. The breakaway clasp still works, but now the collar stays one length. I suppose a second option would be to tie a knot outside the slider as well.Overall I recommend the product since it has worked better than anything else."
1,Lousy tech support!,"I purchased this software a month ago. I have yet to get it installed. I have installed hundreds of programs in my life, and never had this kind of trouble. MacMillan software has not responded to 3 e-mails, or 2 phone calls yet. I won't EVER buy anything that they distribute again. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Impractical,"I am a Visual Basic programmer who wanted to learn XML. This book started out with history, goals, and the future of XML that took around 50 pages. Then it proceeded with theory that did not stop until the end. For example, it does not tell you how to display an XML document until Chapter 10, and that's 200 pages of boring, useless reading. And when it tells you how to display a document, it does so only theoretically. After quitting reading the book (appx. Chapter 7), I decided to load the sample XML documents from the CD and try to understand them without the book. I was able to learn more with just trial and error in 30 minutes than I was able with this book in 150 pages.In short, if you want to learn the theory of XML you might like this book, however if you need to learn XML to actually use it, look somewhere else."
2,Cut my Cote,This book is good from a historical perspective but as I was looking for simple garment patterns most of the ones in this book are too complicated for my purpose.I am sure it has a place but it was not what I wanted.
4,Big fun for my daughter!,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and it's worth every penny. She loves to lay on it and throw herself on it for some giggles. It arrived quickly and is her favorite toy by far.
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this paperback version is very Poor. The end of chapter summaries, tables and images are illegible. The quality of the book is equivalent to a photocopy of photocopies of photocopies of photocopies."
3,Love the book; hate the Kindle edition,"I enjoyed these books (it's a trilogy) when I first read them, and it's taken a long time for them to show up as Kindle editions. My excitement was diminished when I downloaded the trilogy (as Kindle editions) to find them rife with typos and errors of all sorts. This is very distracting and reduces the enjoyment of the read. Sometimes it's as simple as a missing period, but sometimes it's a word transcribed incorrectly -- 'fradition' instead of 'tradition' for example -- and this catches a reader's attention and is very distracting. The series deserves four starts -- it isn't great literature, after all -- but I'm forced to give the Kindle edition of all of these books less than four stars because of the 'translation' to 'Kindle.'"
5,a top notch story with appealing characters,"This book grabs you right away and keeps on going. The combination of excellent storyline and character developement is all too uncommon. What really amazed me was the way Mcmullen was able to switch from one main character to another. The last fourth of the book seemed to lose direction a little bit and did not live up the the rest of the book. Nontheless, this is really not a major flaw. McMullen has joined the very short list of authors whose books I will continue to buy in hardback>"
1,Glaring Inaccuracies,"I read a borrowed copy of this book and am glad that I didnt spend my money on this. It is filled with emotion and not facts. Every year there are half a million or so people who make their first skydive (tandem or otherwise) and if this sport was truly as dangerous as this book would like you to believe we would have half a million people dead every year. Seriously, spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for a fictional / emotional rendering of reality."
5,Wilbur Smith is a story teller,"Shore is an incredible story of survival and endurance. The reader is lead into the story and as Smith can always do, you are there and experiencing what is taking place. The characters are real and you feel what they are experiencing. You touch, smell and hear what the characters do. This is one that Smith fans should not miss."
4,The Burning Shore - A worthwhile read,This book is up to par with the rest of the Courtney series. Not the best but good.
3,A sight-seers guide,"this book covers a fair number of small rivers in new jersey. It has lots of background information on the towns they run through, but it seems to be aimed more at people who are ""exploring"" the rivewrs by driving near them in a car. If you're really interested in canoeng in New Jersey get Edward Gertler's Garden State Canoeing-it's fantastic and covers details about every conoeable stream in the state. This book (Exploring....) is better for sight seeing."
1,Shame on Princeton,"This book includes, as one of the best 162, ""Bastyr University"" which is neither school for MDs or OD -- but for naturopaths! Naturopathy is total quackery and has nothing to do with real medical schools. But I'm sure the naturopaths will be delighted to see this apparent endorsement by Princeton.Also this book uses the term ""allopathic"" to refer to real medical schools. This term is a derogatory word invented in the 19th century by homeopaths to refer to those practices that aren't homeopathic."
4,Lethal Marriage gave me nightmares!,"I never had heard of these two nuts before either, but just recently they have been thrust back into the spotlight and I became interested in their story so I checked this book out from the library, and I was ABSOLUTELY STUNNED! I was also shocked at the fact that a woman had taken part in the sadistic and gruesome tortures that occur in the book. I made it a point not to read this book before going to bed because it gave me nightmares, and just kept my mind racing at night with the unbelievable thoughts of what these two did! The book was very interesting, and at times hard to read because of the tortures they commit, and the words that there victims yelled are printed verbatim and it just tugs at your heart to know that such young girls were ...the way they were. I would have given this book 5 stars but I had to take a star away because of the nightmares."
2,Sonicare Crest i8500 Power Toothbrush,"A product feature needed is missing. The toothbrush turns off 2 minutes after turned on, as a part of the designers idea on how to help the public brush for a certain period of time. This feature is not deselectable and is annoying to someone who brushes for longer than 2 minutes. A complaint on this feature was sent to the manufacturer and ignored, also annoying. I would not recommend this product."
1,Stinky Mess,"I've had it for a while now and I'm going back to the older model that I had before it. Because this version opens up in the front where the toothpaste goes, the water leaks into there and into the entire area where you replace the head. So all of your backwash and suds from the toothpaste goes in and causes bacteria. You have to constantly keep opening it up to clean it. You can smell it after a while and no matter how much cleaning you do, it doesn't help. I am not that lazy, I can take an extra second to put the toothpaste on my toothbrush. Trust me, you're better off. I got it when it first came out, so I didn't have the luxury of looking at the reviews. I hope this helps someone out there. I would suggest the older version, or maybe even the newer version. Any version except this one."
2,WHAT HAPPENED MUFFY?,"I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPEND. I REALLY HATE TO COMPARE THIS ALBUM TO RAY OF LIGHT BUT IT IS REALLY HARD NOT TO. ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT MADONNAS FOLLOW-UP TO THAT MASTERPIECE WOULD BE SUCH A SHALLOW, EMPY, AND EMOTIONLESS ALBUM. I'M REALLY DOUBT THAT MADONNA HAD MUCH INPUT INTO THE PRODUCTION AND WRITING OF THIS ALBUM. IT DOSENT SEEM PERSONAL AT ALL. I'M SUPRISED THAT SHE HAS LET HER ART SLIP LIKE THIS. ITS REALLY A SLAP IN THE FACE OF HER REAL FANS. I REALLY EXPECTED MORE. I THINK THAT THE ALBUM WILL SELL WELL, BUT HONESTLY I DONT THINK THAT ITS VERY GOOD. I'VE GIVEN 2 STARS ONLY BECAUSE ITS A MADONNA ALBUM AND I LOVE HER PREVIOUS WORK. IF THIS ALBUM WAS FROM ANY OTHER ARTIST IT WOULD GET 1 STAR. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I'd give it a 1/2 Star!,"Boy what a bland CD! Overly produced and boring lyrics and no catchy hooks or any really stand out tracks. It look likes she rushed this one out to rake in some cash for the up coming X-mas season. I loved Ray of Light so this is a really disappointment. Plus, it was only 40 something minutes (which is a rip off but maybe it's a good thing in this case). Even her Erotica and Bedtime Stories albums are much better than this. For those that want Madonna to go back to bubble pop, please. Well done house music is fun and great to dance to, not this one though. actually this is not even house music. it's electronic funk whatever."
1,Your Acid Rock Sucks,"I'm a fan of Madonna's and I thought ""Ray of Light"" was great, even though it was a sound I wasn't used to hearing much from her. So here comes the single ""Music,"" which was funky and futuristic. After listening to the CD I was so ticked off for wasting my money on it. ""Music"" isn't exciting at all. Too many bleeps, very little emotion, too many bizarre and lousy lyrics. The only good tracks are ""Music"" and ""Runaway Lover"". I held on to this CD for as long as I could because it looked good with my Madonna collection. But eventually it started taking up space and I sold it just to make room for my newer CDs. Get ""Ray of Light,"" ""Erotica,"" ""Bedtime Stories,"" ""Like A Prayer,"" or her self-titled album. Get any of her earlier music instead of this. You're not missing anything here."
3,"Y'know, kids, there's a whole world of real MUSIC out there.","..it just requires a little digging. Madonna is a brand name. You're being marketed to, and it's time you faced that fact. If all you know is what's on the charts, then you're seriously deprived. Do a little research...and please don't take so much stock in the fact that so many contemporary critics give Madonna so much leeway. They have to find something good to say about such a phenomenon, and they play right into her money-grubbing little hands.This CD is at best ""good of kind."" But what's the ""kind""? Conjob pop is what it is. And Madonna is laughing at you all the way to the World Bank."
2,Disappointing like Ray of Light,How can Madoona be trendsetting and innovative when all she's doing is rehashing bad techno ideas from 1992?
3,folk/pop/rock,"madonna returns after ""ray of light"" with this follow up. ""music"" incorporates more folky/weird synths with some awesome beats. madonna's vocals on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired. she sounded more free on ""ray of light"" than on ""music"". still it's a good effort and at least madonna keeps pop music fresh. faves are: ""music"", ""amazing"", ""nobody's perfect"", ""don't tell me"", and ""what it feels like for a girl""."
2,Not Her Best,"Madonna should try to figure out what she wants to be and stick with it. This recording is rather lacking in focus. This thing she has with trying to be all music to all people is wearing a little tired. Her recordings use to set the standard, now they just follow the pack. It's not awful, its just not what one expects from the moving and shaker of years ago."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I didn't think much of Music when it first came out but I've been listening over and over and it's grown on me. I think however that on some of the tracks we go a little too techno. Nobody's Perfect is fantastic and Paradise Not for Me reminds me of an Enigma track. Lyrically Madonna goes from very poinient (Gone) to throughaway filler (Impressive Instant). Music as a whole, it is not coherent like Ray of Light was, but it does stand as a great collection of Dance Songs, which I think was Madonna's intention this go around. All in all it's never a waste to hear Madonna's new music, but overall it is not one of her greatest"
4,I would recommend this album if you like pop music.,"Well Madonna did it once again with her new album titled Music. I think the album is great. Music is a good dance song to dance to. The song Nobodys perfect is probaly the best soft song on it. I deserve it,and amazing are also good. I would think that this years album is better than last years."
3,Where has the real Madonna gone to?,I am guessing that many of the albums songs will be remixed to death (like Music was) to make them palatable to dance to. I miss vintage Madonna. House music is for the pharmaceutical crowd..Hopefully for Madonna's next album she will cross back over......
4,Madonna's new CD,I've really been enjoying how Madonna continues to reinvent herself CD after CD. The only surprise I found with this CD is that there is only 10 tracks on it. The CD is full of dance tracks with an occasional slow mix. Great CD for cruising in the car.
4,this is very different....,"...from ray of light. while it's obvious that this record is for the clubs, it's not as, how do we say it, as serious as ray of light. this is madonna in one of her partayyyyy moods, especially in the song 'music'. my favourite has to be don't tell me, it's a wonderfully weird and beautiful and profound... and it's just brill!!! while i'm *not* a dance/techno/garage/whatever type of music lover, i enjoy this cd coz essentially this is madonna. while i may not like the country outfit she insisted on using, i have to say only madonna can do this 180 degree turn and succeed in doing it too.'what it feels like for a girl' is another nice one... really madonna. i have to say this needs getting used to especially if you're not fond of dance and club thingy type of sounds, but it has enough of pop madonna music to stop it from being annoyingly techno. while i rate this a little bit lower than ray of light, i still think it deserve a look see."
5,Music,"Music being the album directly following Ray of Light is an amazing recording. The sound is crisp, the keyboard sounds are great and the use of vocoder is right on the mark. William Orbit is a great producer and the combination of him with Madonna is pure gold. Impressive Instant is my favorite track on the album, and I also love Paradise (not for me) and Nobody's perfect. The book-let is a sorry story and that is such a shame. No lyrics. Very few photos. Still this is an amazing record that should not be missed!"
3,"Rushed, but good","This was Madonna's biggest selling album until 2005's ""Confessions On A Dance Floor"" was released.Most fans think this album was rushed in order to capitalize on the success of its predecessor, 1998's ""Ray Of Light"", and they're probably right. This album used a different producer than ROL, bringing in the then unknown Mirwais Ahmadzhai to complete the album. Why she didn't use William Orbit on this album like she should have remains a mystery. He still produced three tracks on this album, and those ones are the stand out tracks."
5,WOW! This is a truly hypnotic CD,"I have been a fan of Madonna from the beginning of her run in the early 1980's. She has lost me a couple of times along the way, but I've always considered myself a fan. The last Madonna CD I bought was ""Erotica,"" and while it had a few good songs, I found it to uneven as a whole. I had heard a couple of tracks from ""Ray Of Light"" and I dug them, but I never pursued the CD.Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago when I heard ""Music"" blasting in a dance club, and I was hooked. ... Well, I liked them all, so I went out and bought the CD! What a great collection of tunes! I find the CD to be completely hypnotic. I especially find ""I Deserve It"" to be totally mesmerizing - I can listen to it over and over.""Music"" has already moved right up near the top of my all time favorite CD's. My advice is to buy this CD ASAP!"
1,More bilge from Ms. M.,"Eccch. More mindless drum machines. More thoughtless lyrics. More bad singing. Get in line, America!"
2,Probably Madonna's Worst Album Yet!,"Remember Cher's ""Do You Believe?"" song, where her voice was all f*&ked up by some electro-synth stuff? Well, apparently, Madonna didn't think it was so bad, because she decided to release an entire album of it. Sure, some of the songs are pretty catchy. I mean, Madonna knows what she's doing, generally. I guess it's the electronic age, and I'd better get with the fricken' program. It's probably great. I'm sure I don't know what I'm talking about (read: I'm listening to it, but not for long) (two slices of toast)"
4,She just gets better and better...,"Because of the song ""Music"", I just had to buy this cd. And at first, I really didn't really like this cd. It's definitely different in that there's a lot of unnatural variations of her voice. That was rather disappointing. I think her voice is just fine without adding computer enhancements to it, etc.However, after I gave it another chance, I grew to really enjoy the cd. My favorite songs (in addition to ""Music"") are ""Don't Tell Me"", ""Runaway Lover"", and surprisingly ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"". I've heard people mention that they think her new cd is ""countryish"", which is far from the truth, it's more of a combination of pop and techno. Dressing like a cowgirl on the cover doesn't mean that she's singing country!The more I listen to it, the more I like it...."
3,"I tried, but I can't listen to this cd.","I tried to listen to Music by Madonna, but I was unhappy with the music. I still enjoy Madonna's earlier cds that include True Blue and Like a Virgin."
4,She never quits being great...,"Although this album is not as deep and contemplative as ""Ray of Light,"" it offers a variety of catchy and ORIGINAL fast and slow tunes. I guess you could say it's the lighter side of a mature Madonna."
5,much more even than ray of light,"as good as ray of light was, this album sounds much more even and there are actually uptempo tracks that are listenable instead of overporoduced with foreign sounds. Music was a track that had ""madonna classic"" written all over it, as were don't tell me, what it feels like for a girl which were also releases. The rest of the album consists of tracks with guitars and a couple techno tracks. Definitely check it out"
1,This not music,Although this CD is called `Music' what you are listening is not Music. This CD can be classified under the Software section rather than the Popular Music Section
3,Very Decent,"Well, I got this album for Christmas and put it on. It was alright. The two ""hit"" singles are all I really liked. I'm more a fan of good albums than of good singles, so I thought that this whole CD was ehh, okay. Extra Medium. Buy it if you want to hear a couple good tracks. If your interested in buying an album that you can put on and listen to front to back, invest in something else."
4,Riddell San Francisco 49ers Helmet,I just received my helmet and I gotta say everything couldn't be better accept for the fact that the helmet you receive is not the one in the picture. It is the 2009 helmet that the team currently wears. The one in the pic is the 1995-2008 helmet but other then this the item itself is a must have for any true 49ers fan!
1,This Movie Is Horrible,This movie stinks...Henry Winkler is a bad actor and Hepburn is in full Parkinsons swing with her head moving and shaking like a dashboard ornament...it was too painful to view...and probably more painful to make...
4,20 Hot Potatoes Used by Adult Sunday School Class,"Our adult Sunday School class used this book to provide 20 topics for discussion about Christian values and responses to issues. Tony treats each issue with real life examples that help the class members relate with the issue and make the discussion interesting, enlightening and meaningful. As class facilitator, I did not need a guide for leading the class. Often I would start the class by reading a key sentence in the chapter we were discussing and asking ""Why do you believe Tony said that?"" Our class has been a great learning experience."
1,puhLEEZ what is this price?,"there has to be some mistake, Amazon. Are you really there?I'd rather buy a new system than pay this for replacement heads. When everybody else buys a new system, (or is that your motive?) what will you do with the leftover replacement heads?"
5,"2 ""all clear"" dental check ups since using this brush","Have had problems with gums receding and two treatments... until I started using this brush.Yes, the replacement heads are a little expensive, however, you only need to replace one every 6 months."
1,Ships Within 4 Weeks?,"I ordered this item over a week ago and came back to check the shipping status today because the item hadn't arrived. To my astonishment, amazon predicts another 2 weeks until delivery! I would have been better off calling every store in my area to find this item. Who can wait a month for a toothbrush?"
1,Big Mess,I cut my loss and purchased the new Elite. Between the mess and cost it isn't worth it. I just chalk it up to a bad purchase.
4,Only available on line,"My dentist said my teeth and gums are better than he had ever seen them. I wouldn't buy this model of Sonicare again, though. The toothpaste holder holds moisture and gets mold (YUCK!)I will buy another Sonicare, though."
3,"SONNY, THANK GOD YOU'RE DEAD",Steer Clear of this game. The adaptation of the Godfather plot line is disjointed and the graphics are circa 1999. I can't decide whether to throw it on eBay or throw it out the window. The controls are frustrating. When you have seen one cake shop you have seen them all. It's not that they just look alike its that they are in fact the same stupid cake shop. That goes for all the other shops as well. When your in the middle of creating such a generic NYC who has time to create multipal interior spaces. I should feel lucky that the cake shop and the smoke shop didn't look like the deli. This could have been a tremendous gangster game especially with its title.
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this for my husband and was very disappointed. He's not much of a gamer anymore (who has time) but loves the Godfather. I was very disappointed in the controls and really how difficult the game is. It really takes more time than its worth and you get frustrated very easily. If I had to do it over, I wouldnt waste my money."
2,Skip this One,"Played Mafia??? Well this is same but with worse music.. slightly better graphics and story... should be. The game gets old and when you become Don guess what... I don't know what to do. No multiplayer. Hard gamer? takes 2-3 days to finish. You'll be bored and $30 for 3 days is a touch on high side wait till it gets down to $10 it is worth that. Oh yaa, get the Magnum upgrade first you'll be glad you did. Print a map on-line the one they send is unusable and getting to map in game is a torture device."
1,Don't use this item...,"I make cakes and decided that it would be so much easier to just buy the fondant than to make it so I went out to purchase this product. It is so easy to work with and makes cakes come out BEAUTIFUL but the taste is HORRIBLE. It tasted like something chewy mixed with nail polish remover.If your looking for a beautiful cake and are going to warn people to take the fondant off first, this is a good product. But don't offer to make someone a cake (especially one that they are going to pay for) and use this product. Your reputation will be shot."
1,Absolutely disgusting!,"I would not in good conscience serve a cake covered with this fondant to anyone. It is absolutely horrible! Its ease of use is pointless if the taste is this bad. I once wrote to Wilton about this and they wrote back saying that their product is best in the market (bite me!) and supposedly has a mild vanilla flavor (it is more like more like sweet play-doh + rancid oil). Other brands while harder to find, are a thousand times better (satin ice/ fondarific). Now that Duff Goldman fondant is made available easily, I hear Wilton is finally going to change the formula. We'll have to wait and see if they get their act together or continue their strategy of making poor quality products just because many consumers don't have other easy options or just don't know that there is better stuff available."
2,Not very good.,"While this fondant isn't the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth, I wouldn't want to eat a cake made with it. It rolls and shapes nicely, but it tastes terrible. My advice is to either go with another brand of rolled fondant or make your own."
2,Not My First Choice for Fondant,"Actually, Wilton fondant isn't even my 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choice. I have used this fondant for covering cake boards and for figures that will not be consumed, but I would never use this fondant to cover a cake that was going to be eaten as I find the taste of Wilton fondant to be disgusting. There are far too many other brands of fondant out there that are superior in both taste and ease of use to settle for using Wilton fondant."
2,Eww!,Its like supper nasty i like because its easy to use. When you use gel food paste it makes nice colors
1,So stiff and dries out,"I can't tell you how crappy this fondant is to work with. it is so stiff. My husband and I tried it several times we both sat with half the box each and worked it until our hands were sore to get it vaguely softened. Then I tried to roll it out, it was so stiff I was using my whole body weight to roll it. My husband rolled it out with difficulty. By the time you've managed to roll it thin enough (all that effort takes time) it has dried out and cracks as it folds over the cake. Terrible fondant. Satin Ice is much much better, more pliable, easier to roll out and much nicer flavour. Stay away from Wilton!!!!"
3,Poor instructions,"It is an excellent product and does what it is suppose to do. However, due to using the Cables to go product (usb 2.0 IDE adapter)as it was assembled on arrival, it burned out my Lap top hard drive motor. Upon re-reading the instructions (poorly written at best) I used a magnifying glass to look at the picture closer and noticed that the power cable on the Laptop to IDE hard drive adapter was reversed, and I had ""assumed"" since it arrived assembled that it was correct, WRONG. Now I must search for an inexpensive solution to replacing my Laptop hard drive motor so I can gather my information once again. The product worked without a hitch on my Desk top hard drive where the additional plug is not required."
5,Deulez and Lang,If you want to experience what is exprement then try to listen to this master piece. You will feel an absolutely and philosophically conceptuality surmounting the human perception-boundary of aesthetics.
1,Bernhard Lang is a ridiculous phony,"Bernhard Lang is a totally obvious and transparent phony. This is his schtick: he attacks legitimate composers (i.e. he declared ""music written on 'five lines'"" to be ""dead"" -- he was referring to the ""five lines"" of staves in sheet music), he makes pretentious and vague references to philosophers (which he clearly fails to understand), incorporates gimmicky elements of ghetto music and kitsch (Eurotrash disco beats anyone?), and declares himself to be a political revolutionary.In short, he has made a career of putting up smoke screens to hide his utter lack of musical ability, technical knowledge, and general ignorance. He is a ""composer"" of exceedingly minor importance, who will undoubtedly fade into the trash bin of history the moment he is no longer around to fake out gullible sycophants.Fair warning, do not waste your money on this piece of crap CD."
4,Grim-Dark Meets Evil Overlord Checklist,"I have not read extensively in the 40K universe, but this is not the first book I have read. However, it is by far the most grim-dark that I have read. From the moment the book begins, you can feel the hopelessness and overwhelming odds that face humanity in that distant future. Sister Superior Miriya tries her best in all things, but the darkness just always seems to overcome her. She always survives, but with more and more tragedies and loss to burden herself.Towards the end of the book, however, I began to wonder if the author pulled out the Evil Overlord checklist and began picking things to do. It seemed every action the villain took was from that list. (Have your enemies in your power, but leave them alive. Give lengthy speeches about your plans. Leave their arms where they can be found. Turn your back. Ignore signs of them coming up behind you.) My desire to laugh made it hard to stay in the grimdark mindset."
3,Decent Movie...,"(...) hey I loved the guy as a wrestler, but let's face facts, he's not believable in any of his roles outside of a wrestler. In this movie he plays a war hero who comes back to his town to find it corrupted by an evil man and his casino and greed. The Rock gets appointed sherrif and with his sidekick Knoxville tries to take back the town for the people. The plot was pretty good, as it was a remake from an earlier movie by the same name, and Knoxville was likeable in his role. The movie was enjoyable and much better than the god awful ""Rundown."" (...)"
4,A good re-make of a semi-classic flick.,"I like The Rock. He's an honest actor, humble and willing to always do his best. I also liked this movie because it does not use high tech gimmicks and stuff generated by computer specialists.This is a bare knuckles, down-to-earth action flick. Too bad that I could only buy the PG-13 version. According to The Rock's comments, there is an R-rated version which includes a little more spicy stuff. Not that it would affect the plot in any negative way. Is just that I hate censorship.Otherwise, is a fine action movie, even whent it stands a bit in the shadow of the 1973 version, but still with high honors."
4,Great movie,"The Rock fans will enjoy this action filled movie with a great script, excellent acting, and just a fun time to enjoy your day with a great movie. Worth the bucks!"
4,Totally fine,"If you don't really expect anything from this movie, it's totally fine. It's entertaining, not too long, doesn't really make you think or dig for any emotional response. It's just telling a ""guy stands up for what's right"" story in very 80's fashion but with less craziness. Saw it in the theater, don't know why, but was totally fine with it."
3,I was a little disappointed by this film,"Don't get me wrong. I like the Rock and he flexes his muscle in this film with as much charisma as ever. I also like action flicts. This is a good one with enough raw violence to satisfy those who are becoming bored with the same old martial arts formulas.HOWEVER, I grew up following the legend of Buford Pusser. I was a junior in high school when he died in an automobile accident. He was one person who lived a life with even more adventure and blood and guts than is potrayed by the fictional characters of this film. This was one time that the film makers should have stayed with reality.I wouldn't mind the film IF it had a different name and was not tied so closely to the earlier ""Walking Tall"" legacy. But it was just close enough to build up my expectations and just far enough for me to feel let down."
5,Remake of the 1973 film Walking Tall,"The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn,who just returns home from the army after being gone 8 years.Alot has changed in the small town. The main attraction of the town is the casino,whose security guards are selling drugs to kids.When Vaughn spots the gamer at the craps table switching dice and desides to take care of it,the corrupt casino employees mess him up and leave him for dead.When his nephew almost dies from taking drugs that were bought off the casino's security guards,Vaughn unleahes his one man assault to become sheirff and clean up the town.There's lots of great action and a little bit of humor thrown in.IF you love the Rock or just want to watch a great action film go watch ""Walking Tall"".Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,Don't Bother,"I am MAD. I purchased this for the skit ""Ode To Tracking Numbers"" featuring Kristen Wiig and Paul Rudd. ITS NOT EVEN ON HERE!!!! I am contacting Amazon Customer Service right now! I had to give it 1* to create this review but I would not have given it any at all"
2,no cougar den???? are you kidding me????,the whole entire reason I purchased this was to show some people the cougar den skit and I paid for this? I am soooooooooooooo outraged that I was not told that I was buying a partial video.
1,Poor - Unacceptable Really,"Poor quality viewing on my broadband Mac. Arrived at this site from the HULU site, which displayed the video quite well at full screen size, but this is far, far from the quality on that site. I consider this purchase and viewing to be unacceptable, and feel just a bit ""conned"" in the transaction. I won't make the same mistake ever again. Be very careful as you ""click through"" to such links. It only cost me $1.99 this time, I hope it never costs anyone else."
4,Just what is needed,I tried a few different types of bulbs in my opener. They just can't handle the shaking that opening puts on them. This bulb will last a good year if it's anything like my last set.
5,Quintessential Scandanavian Children's Book,"Mirabelle is a lovely, medium-length picture book. The story is distinctly Swedish - the setting, the way the tale evolves... Mirabelle has a fair bit of suspense, a lot of imagination, and very well-suited illustrations. I LOVED this story, and my kids really enjoyed it as well. The first person narrative perspective makes the story more compelling, and the little chicken in the pictures is a fun side story.Enjoy this one - don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you like imaginative, interesting, child-like stories, with playful illustrations, you'll like Mirabelle."
3,an [inexpensive] way to improve your kitchen,"I think this book has nice fun-to-do projects. The style is Country/Shaker, but even people who typically do not like those styles will like these projects."
5,JOA,"Joan of Arcadia is the BEST show ever made. It makes you want to be a better person, by making you realize that every choice you make has a ripple effect and that sometimes even the smallest thing can have big ripples."
5,The best show on television in years!,"I just love this show and had to buy the first season on DVD! It's wonderful to watch and there is not one single episode that I did not like. Sure, some were greater than others, but that's normal for any television show. This show stands out, reaches out and actually makes you think. A wonderful accomplishment by its creator Barbara Hall and all the writers involved. I wish CBS would have thought twice about cancelling after only two seasons, but sadly this again proves that money rules over quality. So sad.-TeeJay from Germany"
1,DON'T SEE WHAT ALL THE HYPE IS,"Obviously the show was cancelled because the audience dwindled. The first season ends with a poorly executed and silly finale with Joan getting Lyme disease. I tried to like this series and watched the DVD collection with my best friend. It has its moments but I really don't see what all the hype is about. If the show is so great, why did the audience diminish in droves in the second season? Again, the first season finale might give you some clues. As for the actors, they are fine in their respective roles. The DVD set is mastered quite nicely and there are many extras. But the show is not in the ""classic"" realm the way other long running shows are. It had its possibilities but in my own opinion, it just didn't deliver."
4,"Well, he is ""the king of rhythm of blues""! Right?","Between the time that he was a member of New Editon and, subsequently became ""Mr. Whitney Houston,"" Brown was a prominent fixture on the pop music scene. This complilation of remixes of hits by the singer shows how prolific he was in his day. With the hits like ""Rock Wit'cha,"" Don't Be Cruel,"" ""My Prerogative,"" and ""Every Little Step,"" Brown delivered some of the more memorable tunes of the late eighties/early nineties.And for that reason, the collection fills the bill for fans of contemporary pop/R & B.It's unfortunate that the singer's apparent self-destructive nature led to a career that was tentative, at best, in need of a major re-ignition."
1,"Be informed:This is NOT a performance CD, it.s an INSTRUCTIONAL CD","BE INFORMED: This is not a performance CD by Carrie Underwood.. It is an instructional CD. It only has 1 song...How Great Thou Art... The song is performed 7 times in 7 different pitches. Quoting the CD, it says, ""Demonstration is in the high range as made popular by Carrie Underwood."" This is not a CD of her singing Praise Hymns. We thought we were getting a CD of Carrie singing Praise Hymn's, buy it is an instructional CD."
2,not what I expected,"This was not wha I expected. How Great Thou Art, was great,but the only song on itI must have misunderstood what it was about"
5,Makes a great gift!,"We bought this book for my dad for Father's Day this year, and thought he would have fun reading it since he has four granddaughters. He loved it and has even selected stories to read to the girls during over-nights with Grandpa and Grandma. I highly recommend it as a great gift."
2,Not worth it,"I know the price of this item is appealing, but the actual kit is very cheap quality. The nasal suction was just horrible (mine arrived broken). I returned this kit immediately after receiving it. Would only recommend under dire circumstances."
3,Very sub par products,"I was confused as to why it was priced over 15 bucks for something made so cheap. When I got it in the mail, there were actually two sets in my box. To beat all.. One set was missing the brush and the aspirator was broken. Since I was able to combine them to make a nice functional set, I just went with it and didn't bother to do a return because I didn't want the hassle. You would probably be best to just go buy a set from Wal-Mart, this one is just so cheap that I may even buy a different soon lol"
4,An excellent choice!,"This book is full of information. I have been in the oilfield since 2007 and was searching for a book to help me sort out my career choice in the industry. What that simply means is that I have had numerous jobs performing many different functions in the oil and gas industry. So, I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue a career in exploration, production or engineering. After reading this book front to back twice, its clear what I want to do. Inside the context of these pages is the explanation of everything related to oil and gas formation. If you are considering a career in the oilfield, this is an excellent choice for people starting with no experience to someone who has years of experience. This book will help you understand everything from the history of the earth to refining oil and gas once its produced."
4,Exciting and Sobering,"This was a great look at a chimpanzee life. De Waal notes that obviously there will be some differences in the wild versus his observations of the chimp colony at Arnhem, but the vast majority will be similar. This is an informative and enthralling look at chimp life (and none to subtly our own) among the leaders and absolutely delivers on the title with no deviation from the topic. This edition includes a heartbreaking epilogue and I highly recommend it. Simply an outstanding treatment and good observational science. Nice work.The book is an easy, enjoyable read."
2,Had the potential to be a Great Series,"The first viewer summed up the technical aspects of the series well, so no need to add to it. To my dismay, the series portrays only US and Israely Aces. No Canadian,British, Polish, Czech or Russian Aces. Never mind the Aces of the other side, the german, italian, romanian, finish and japanese, who got no mention at all.Since we live in a global community, to portrait the dogfights of all countires, in the last 90 years,would have made this series more popular around the globe. It seems it was made for US and Israely consumption only.I hope this series will add a broader spectrum in later productions.They should also add military commentators and eyewitnesses from other countries too.Also, when the producers handpick the most successful US & Israeli exploits only, it leaves a wrong impression to the lesser educated viewers about the war in the air."
5,Works great,"Works great. It took me a few minutes' of experimentation to figure out the exact right settings for my particular monitor - the included instructions and tiny charts were helpful, but to start with I still wasn't 100% sure which settings I should use - but after a couple minutes I finally discovered the correct DIP-switch settings and now the resolutions and everything work out just fine.This Belkin adapter seems to work equally well on either the Mac's built-in video, as well as also working fine (at least for me) when plugged into my old ATI PCI-card that I use for a second monitor. Either/both ways work fine in my experience with this particular Mac."
2,Too much violence for me,"I've been reading science fiction and fantasy for over 50 years now and although I have read and very much liked most of what Ringo has written, this book contained so much violence that it turned me off the book. Once I start a book I very rarely stop reading and drop the book; this was one of the few I dropped. Had the plot been more interesting and the characters been better developed perhaps I would have stayed the course but, they weren't and I didn't."
2,Get Real,"This is not a sci-fi story. J. Ringo just put his name on it. Julie Cochrane needs to stick to romance novels and John needs to read what he is putting his name on. When I read about Cally in the first novels #1-4 of the Posleen Wars, I liked the character. She was definitely a daddy's girl. She shows she can take care of herself and her ""granpa,"" fighting assassins and 'posties,' even surviving a nuke dropped on her head. She has strong family ties and later strong female influences. But all that is for nought, when she is portraited as a psychopathic slut assassin in this novel. There is all kinds of room for character developement and storylines from the first novels to get an excellent novel. But, JC obviously went for the teenage male hormone raging reader. I don't recommend this novel at all. Unless, you're a teenage male hormone raging reader."
5,Fine book!,"Continues a great series. This is a fine book by a great author! The main character is one sweet gal, as long as she is on your side!"
5,Finding the Peace of Christ,"The Christ-Centered Heart is a wonderful book addressing how we live peacefully in the midst of the realities of life. Dr. Mathis artfully weaves together his own reflections with those of some of the great writers in the Christian tradition, as well as writers from other perspectives, offering the reader practical spiritual advice to live each moment in the peace of Christ. The book is well thought out, well researched, and clearly presented. Highly recommended."
2,A disappointed Fan,"Another cookbook without pictures! I saw this book in the store, but didn't want to get it. I have been going to the Lemongrass Restaurant in Sacramento for the past 3 years. The last time was about 2 months ago. Big disappointment. The food looked good but the taste wasn't Vietnamese or Thai at all (I am Vietnamese). It looked more European. Wonder what she was trying to do? We were not happy with the whole dinner. We decided not to return to the restaurant. I have her first book but haven't used it the past 2 years. For someone who is popular in the Bay Area should do a lot better! I think her cooking is overrated from the SF Chronicle."
2,"Great animation, but no originality","Final Fantasy IX starts out as being a completely different experience. However, it is soon apparent that Square was not thinking correctly when doing this storyline. The monsters almost all bear names that have appeared in previous titles, the black mage (though cool) and the Dragon Knight (wicked, but enough is enough) resurface quickly and linger throughout the game. At first it's fun to see these popular themes resurface, but it has gone way too far. The only plus sides to this game that I can think of are: the great graphics and animation and the music (Uematsu has done it again!) Plus the RPG is too short; if you can get an item by beating the game in less than 12 hours, it is too short, ok? No questions asked."
3,Not the best FF game,"Out of the PS1 and PS2 Final Fantasy games, this one is my least favorite. The plot line is rather bland and the game is too cartoony after the last few."
4,Back to what really works in an RPG,"Squaresoft had gotten a bit bizarre and outlandish with some of their RPGs that came after Final Fantasy VII and IX. From an artistic point of view, they created titles that explored various systems for combat, tactics, strategy, and storytelling, some which worked better than others.Final Fantasy IX comes back to what really works in an RPG, which is plain heroism, discovery, adventure, and mystery."
5,Perfect...,"I won't waste space here because so many other people have already written what I would otherwise tell you. Final Fantasy IX is, in my opinion, the best RPG and possibly the best game for the Playstation that exists. The storyline, the music, the gameplay, the graphics...it's too much, it's all TOO GOOD! Buy it! No further questions."
5,Brought tears to my eyes,"This game is simply amazing. The graphics are by far the best in the series, (besides X) and wow, the music! i listen to the music almost everynight on my ipod. i have the whole soundtract. It isn't to hard to beat, and levealing up is pretty simple. You fall in love with the caracters right away. The storyline is amaizng. And might i add, its so nice to have a game w/out guns and all that crap, final fantasy ix takes it back to a simple time, with magic and swords. Set in a medival setting. The characters are unique and just addorable. They have that childish look to them, but are actually very mature. This game makes me cry everytime. i just love it. it is well worth it. And for it to be only 14 dollars, thats amazing."
4,excellent,"I must admit, I am a big 8 fan, so the switch to 9 was tough. I immediately criticized it for it's cartoony characters... plus, the setting was just so different. But gradually the game won me over. I really love the characters and relationships... and movie sequences. OMG, the best music!! Nobumoto made a breakthrough with ""The Place I'll Return to Someday"" and ""Loss of Me."" Great game. Sometimes frustrating but Vivi overrode that. Actually, the ending fight led up to this... thing. Yeah, I guess the climax was kinda weak and the ending video was disappointing at first, but I watched it again. And I changed my mind. It was pretty good, just not as tight as I would have liked. Vivi and Zidane have this beautuful relationship. (Ah bonding) And another craft of wonder is Freya. KUJA! One of the best villains! He was so great. Why couldn't there be more of him? Anyway, please play the game... if you want. (Though I'm an 8 fanatic)"
4,"A step up from FFVIII, but still no FFVII or FFX","At first, I found myself really enjoying FFIX. I guess thats because its predecessor, FFVIII, was quite possibly the worst Final Fantasy ever made. As the story of FFIX progressed I found it kind of stupid, and the character development was just lame. Still I must say I did enjoy it for the gameplay and not to mention the music. I'm not trying to insult this game as a whole, just its story. If you are looking for a good RPG to play, then I give you the thumbs up to buy this one."
3,Hmm...,"When I started playing the game, the first thing that startled me was the excellent graphics. Then I was amazed by the smooth gameplay and enchanting music. And I especially enjoyed the ability to play as two parties. If there's something that makes me addicted, it's a good storyline. Sadly, it takes a while for the latter to surface in this game. Also, the messy battles and strange looking characters failed to impress me. And the overly long absence of certain characters in some parts of the game ( the trip to Burmecia where Garnet and Steiner were away for a worryingly long time ) makes it tiring to help them catch up with the others. All in all, I found the game humourous, the characters lovable and the graphics impressive. Final Fantasy 9 will not fail to enchant less... fussy players."
4,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!,"This is, I think, one of the best games in the series. The story is well written, and the characters are very believable. The game play is also very, very good. It's easy to get into right from the start, especialy for a Role-playing-game. The graphics are another high point. This game is gorgeous. Even more so when you realize this was done on a 32-bit system. I give this game a perfect 10!! Deffinately a must buy!"
4,Best?,"Can someone really say that this is the best Final Fantasy in the series? I'm afraid i cannot. I loved Final Fantasy 7, 8 was not as good as 7 but 9 was better than 7 but not as good as 8. Final Fantasy is played but so many gamers cause of the hype. I love Final Fantasy but I'm going to have to say that when this game is compared to FF7 and FF8 this (disappoints). But if you're a new gamer get this game. If you've played and beaten 7 and/or 8 then get a PS2 and get FFX."
1,yuck,THE WORST FINAL FANTASY GAME EVER! I was really disapointed...it sucked so bad I couldn't get past 30 mins....yuck don't ever want to play/finish this game EVER!
2,A Rush Job W/ anticlimatic ending,"It is obvious that Square Rushed this game to Market. I finished the game in under 25 hours. The end ""Boss"" was a joke and EASILY defeated.People have been trashing FF8 but in comparison, FF8 was a gem. FFIX has a disjointed story, and all the cliches Squaresoft innundates all it's RPGs with (except FF8). The characters become annoying quickly and there is no real challenge througout the entire game. Nothing that comes close to the search for Knights of the Round in FF7, or battling the Ultimate Weapons in FF7 and FF8. I was very disappointed with this game... Thank God for Metal Gear!!"
2,game is on a younger level,"the storyline is too kidie for me and i couldn't finish the game(out of boredom), you might like it. but if you like the story line of ff7 this one will bore you."
5,best final fantasy game ever!!!,"I've been reading other reviews and a lot of people called this game ""complicated"" the gf junctioning is not difficult at all. I got the basics of this game right away. the card game was hard for me at first! but once i got it, it was easygraphics- 5 the movies in this game are amazing.story- 5 although i never understand why squall is so stand offishplayability-5 the easy leveling up ( especially compared to ffx) makes this game soo awesome.the thing that makes this game the best rpg game out there is not only the characters and graphics, but also all the hidden dimensions. i've yet to get some of the hidden guardian forces in this game. i didnt even think to get a few of them until it was too late to find them and i had to play again! this game is awesome!"
1,come on!,what the????? how the??????can anyone possibly find this game to be the least bit entertaining!!my god this is the most boring thing i've ever played in my life!
2,Final Fantasy 8 is awesome. FF9 is dissappointing,"FF8 is absolutely brilliant so get that. FF9 is OK but it isn't even as good as 7, never mind 8. The characters is one of the things that lets this down. I can't wait for 10"
5,It kept my kid borther happy now I can work peacefully!,"Not much to say except this, if this is a final fantasy game it's gotta be good except the online and 12, buy this game if you feel nostalgic."
3,Blink and you'll miss it!,Hm interestingStoryline..... okGraphics...... averageCharacters.... strange to say the leastDifficulty.... train your characters properly and you'll never dieLength........ lets just say that they should have had 15 discs instead of four. I got it on chrismas day .... and its new years eve tomorrowAddictivity... (is that a word?) ok so i played it non stop until i finished it.Good Gamingness (ok so im just making stuff up)........ i thought that despite the dodgey characters ..... a few graphical glitches and a blink and you'll miss it storyline....I REALLY LIKE THIS GAMEalthough the others in the series were perhaps slightly better.P.Scan i tell you a secret?im not under 13!shhhhhh dont tell anyone!
1,No directions would be better. Junk otherwise,"Yes it has a nice green finish. Yes it has no spaces to catch anything in or to collect water.No directions would have been better than the lousy picture.One shelf was out of square by 1/4"".Could not figure out how to hang door, ended up modifying since no holes were drilled to mount screws for hinge.I have rebuilt 2 old cars and spent untold hours designing equipment from scratch. This cage is cheap in price and quality. Any great review is due to a discount or fake review."
4,Great entertainment,"This is a highly amusing comedy with heart. It's a shame that lots of people won't see it because it lacks notority - but I urge you to take the ""risk"" and give this a watch. It's definitely worth two hours of your life!"
2,Rarely works,"If your a collector of Pirates and you wont be taking it out of the package, then this would be an okay buy. The toy lasted an hour tops with my daughter, Jack didnt ""pop"" out of the coffin unless she slammed it against the wall and even on the linoleum floor he cruised around slowly. I would recommend this for a collector only, not as a plaything, since it really didnt work."
4,Interesting,"""Lords of the Night"" is an anthology of previously published Regency Vampire Romances. All of the stories were first published in 1997 so if you are a fan of such books look at the titles of the individual stories carefully to make sure that you haven't already read one or all of the stories.Each of the stories in the anthology has a unique view of Vampirism and are set in Regency era England. Even though none of the stories: `The Full of the Moon', `Dark Shadows' or `The DeVille Inheritance' was riveting to the exclusion of all else, the way that a really good book can sometimes be, it is still a good anthology. What I really liked about all of the stories was that they all had a unique look at what Vampirism is, i.e., what powers Vampires have, and also of how a person becomes a Vampire. I can definitely recommend this book. It would be a great read for the Regency fan who is looking for something `different' and for the Vampire romance reader who is looking for the same."
4,Special Indeed...,"Great album...buy it! Scent of a Woman, Too Much, My Obsession, are great songs. The bonus DVD makes it worth it just for the ""He's a Whore"" video.The listener will be treated to a more complex Cheap Trick sound on this album. Robin Zander shows all of his vocal flavors, from hard rock scream to sweet ballad. He truely is one of Rock's most underrated singers. Rick Nielsen gets some rare guitar solos and Tom Petersson has some intricate bass lines."
2,Buy any CT album but this one,"This is not a good album. The only standout song is Scent of a Woman, a cover. They seem to be trying out a new sound or something, it just does not work. Even the albums without Tom P. were better than this.You want new Cheap Trick, buy Rockford or the 1997 self titled."
3,"Pretty old, pretty basic - forgets to discuss the real important issues...","I suppose this is an acceptable primer for anyone pretty clueless about the real world outside of college - particularly if you were a sheltered person by your parents or you need to better understand the basics of American business culture...I purchased this as a college professor, hoping to find useful reference points for my students.The critical issues I want my students to understand is responsibility and accountability. Also, social habits about texting and media usage at work and other various civilities that are over-looked. This is a very old book - 2001. I'd skip this edition.Self managment, finances and social life (drinking and partying) are big issues that need to be faced by freshly minted college employees - none of these details are in this book. 3 stars are very generous - and buy it used so you're not out much coin if you do want to purchase this book. cheers, Prof. Mike E."
2,Belkin wireless card,Not dependable-caused my computer to have major issues. I suggest you get a Microsoft or Linksys one.
5,The best of both,"Here is a cd from two groups that I'm crazy about. Zaiko and Nyoka Longo are simply at their best, as are Pepe Kalle and Empire Bakuba. What a loss to Africa (and the world) when Pepe Kalle died last winter.I can't figure out who did more on this cd the're both so great."
5,this is a must,This record combines jazz and hip hop in the hippest way. The sound is superb and the playing and singing is fantastic. Can't stop listening to it.
4,A good overview of Revelation,"This book affords a good overview of many prophetic predictions outlined in the Book of Revelation. It favors the literal, premillenial interpretation of the second coming over more historical critical, allegorical interpretations. It's line of argumentation leads to the conclusion that there will be a supernatural transformation of the Earth and a literal resurrection of the dead occurring within the next 50 years."
3,LED light,This particular light is on the large size compared to some others like Fenix. It does work and has a nice throw though.
2,Seemed sturdy but Broke after a week,"Title says it all. I really liked the clip so you could put it on the bill of your hat and have an instant headlamp. Not overly bright but good for working when it is dark. But, it broke in a week! I expect a decade of use out of a flashlight, not a week."
5,Great little flashlight!,"I've used one version or another of these for years, when I travel in the developing world. They last SO much longer on a battery than other small flashlights (e.g., Maglights). Over the years, the beams have gotten stronger, and the battery life has been extended. I keep one at the office (in case of a power failure - we're on the 12th floor) and another in my emergency ""Go Bag."" I've given them to friends to keep in their cars.I have larger and more powerful Gerber flashlights for more serious flashlight use but I think these are the best product at this size and weight."
5,Great Headlight,"This little flashlight works better than expected. I do alot of work in crawlspaces and attics' as well as needing to see behind entertainment centers, couches, ect. This flashlight is small enough to fit in my front pocket so i have it anywhere and the clip it comes with slides over the bill of my ball cap or hard hat and stays in place. INSTANT HEADLIGHT. It provides enough light for me to do what i gotta do and keeps my hands free to do my job. It's more convenient than the company provided headlamp or any other headlamp i've used and keeps me from having to carry a headlamp and another flashlight. If you're looking for something to light up a whole room, look elsewhere. If you're looking for something to light your immediate area and small enough to carry anywhere, this light will work perfectly."
1,overpriced 8LM toy,I might have gotten a bad unit but this 'flashlight' is a joke. Ultra Task???? please... Sad truth but i have a $2 lighter that has a brighter LED on the other end. Apparently its only 8LM which is weak considering its a $14 light. My friend bought a lot of 100 6LED 1xAAA key-chain flashlights for $120shipped from China - he gives them out as gifts for customers and Gerber barely outshines them.
2,"Single AA, a bit bulky","Battery life is good, but build quality leaves a bit to be desired.Lack of a reflector is dumb and only hurts the light output.A bit bulky. The clip frequently gets in the way when trying to turn it on.Blue tintAll in all, it's not terrible, but there are far better ways to spend your money. It should be $10, and would be if the Gerber name wasn't on it.The following light is a bit more money, but it is far superior in build quality, a bit slimmer and is brighter with no tint. Amazing little light. But it instead.Coast LED Lenser LL7840 David 15 DigiTac I Black Luxeon LED flashlight uses just 1 AA battery"
5,Strong and dependable,"This is a great little flashlight. I bought it for travel but have ended it up using it around the house quite a bit. The light is brighter than my old, full-size Mag-Lite."
1,Nice while it lasted.,"""double O-rings; water-sealed circuit board""Um. I loved this little flashlight and used it at work constantly. For about a week. Then it rained. It hasn't worked since."
5,If you liked Live 79 you'll love this...,"I'm was amazed they could still sound so good. This full live show, from 2001, recaptures the spirit of the classic 79-82 band, partly through Huw Lloyd Langton's characteristic playing. They take on a selection of classic tracks, and manage to arrange the older ones so as to sound both faithful and fresh. Here and there the vocals slip off pitch, and the mix is poor for the first minute or so - but these are just signs of a live-no-overdubs festival recording..."
1,Only worked twice,Couldn't agree more with the previous comments about the bad design of the CCM 101. The parts have no lubrication and quickly melted rendering this piece of kit useless after its second go.Money down the toilet.
1,This collar almost killed my cat,"Beware! This collar does not break away, and is not safe. This morning my kitty became entangled in part of my son's toy tent. The collar did not loosen or breakaway, and the cat was unable to breathe until my husband cut the collar and freed her. Very scary. Had we not been home she would not have made it. I recommend you find a true breakaway collar to purchase - not this one."
1,My Cat Lost This Collar in One Month!,"I am still looking for a collar for my outdoor cat that won't come off and get lost. It's been only a month, and both cats showed up without their collars. These collars are pretty, but it won't stay on for long. Don't buy it and put on your city pet license tag, because you will most certainly lose it."
2,"It sure does ""break away"" !","My 5-month old kitten rid himself of this collar within the first 20 seconds after I put it on him. I thought I might have put it on a little too loose, but after readjusting so that one finger fit snugly between it and his neck and putting it back on him, it took all of 10 minutes for him to just snap it off without any effort.The fastening itself is not weak as it takes about the same strength to open as the Coastal Pets SafeCat fastener which this same kitten wasn't able to get off...Also, for a somewhat slimmer cat, the whole fastening is a little too long to fit neatly around the neck I think.So no, I wouldn't recommend it to people with sturdy outdoor cats, and certainly not with a Bombay kitten;)."
4,Cultivate a love of learning in your child,"I don't think anything in this book was revolutionary but it put into words the philosophy my husband and I already have with our boys and gave some more concrete examples of things we can do. The main premise is that the primary responsibility of parents is to help their kids develop a love of learning and help them access more information about topics that interest them, not drill facts into their heads or use rote learning techniques.The author is a homeschooler herself and has written many books on homeschooling. There is a bias for homeschooling present in the book but it wasn't so prevalent that I couldn't overlook it.I recommend this book for parents of traditionally schooled children who want to make sure that school doesn't quash the love of learning in their children or for parents of children who have lost their love of learning and need it rekindled."
4,Great NAS once you get past the firewall,Once I was able to get past my firewall this NAS worked great. The software that comes with it NTI Shadow does everything I need. Very easy to use and the printer server feature is nice.
4,old favourites,"I had a friend many years ago who had this on vinyl record and I fell in love with it. Wondered whether after all these years I would still like it, but it is as fresh and original as it was all those years ago. Glad I bought it."
2,"So, Is It DOOM 3.5? A Mixed Bag.","Similar graphics, better maps, updated AI, another set of lame weapons, nice controls, less demons.When hit, instead of knocking you back, your vision blurs. OK, sure...Half a step above DOOM3 yet retaining some of the QUAKE Series feel.How similar? I would be very surprised if they do not share the same graphics engine!Frankly, I expected more. The new QUAKE games used to raise the standard, and serve as the benchmark of graphics and creativity. Apparently not anymore. Increasing the screen analysis and multiplying the hardware requirements does NOT a new game make!Another corporate clone following the mainstream FPS trend.Let's hope they Game Publishers finally show some respect and let Real Game Artists create something NEW and SMART for a change!"
1,Horrible,I played it for 2 hours and then uninstalled it. It's crap. Everyone online said they had to turn the game to it's lowest graphic settings to play. Avoid at all cost.
2,This is why they won't allow refunds on software.,"If you hated Doom 3 because it was just too darn dark, the ""monsters"" were too predictable, and found that about 1/3 of the way through it was more of a chore than a joy to play... you will hate Quake 4 as well.I keep wishing that it had the same color palette and brightness of Half-life 2, but it doesn't.Nothing has really changed here folks; move along - nothing interesting to see. Literally."
1,Won't even install,"I have a Dell Inspiron with lots of resources, using Windows XP SP2. I have NEVER had an application fail to complete installation before. But Quake 4 did. In the middle of the fourth (!) disk, it just went to sleep. I just went to Activision's support web site, which is kind of a joke. Forget this buggy piece of junk."
1,wouldn't install,"I bought this game back in 05 and it wouldn't install. During disk 2 it could never access a file called something like pak003.pk4, and there was no way around it. Internet searches turned up plenty of people with the same problem, but no solution.I'm reminded because I just found the game on my shelf and tried to install it again. Total waste of money."
1,Quake 4,The game is fun if you are in jail and time is not an issue. To say it takes forever to load does not begin to describe it. A half hour to get it started and then ten to fifteen minutes of play and then all over again and again. My computer exceeds all requirement of the game and still this game really and truly sucks. Not the game but the load time.Spend your money else where or take up sowing. Or read a good book. You will finish the book before you finish this game. Hope this helps. Don't say you were not warned!!!
4,Nice Video,This is a nice video if you like Tanya Tucker. It is not great but I did enjoy it. She performed a lot of her most popular songs from years ago. Her performance is very casual.
1,Disappointing compared to Smitty's previous work,"I've been a huge Smitty fan and bought all his albums since hearing his 'Live the Life' CD in 1998. I've always been impressed by his work, until 'Healing Rain.' I was expecting something on par with 'Live the Life' or 'This Is Your Time,' and I came away very disappointed. It took me years to get tired of those CDs (and even now I still enjoy them), but only a few days for 'Healing Rain' to get old. It doesn't even compare. A lot of the music is very repetitive, and/or the tune never really seems to go anywhere. It doesn't sound like he uses many real instruments in this one, and the lyrical and musical quality seems uninspired, at best. I like 2 or 3 of the songs, but overall it seems clear MWS just didn't put his heart into this album the way he normally does. I hate to say it, and I'm surprised it turned out this way, but there are a lot of other albums out there that could be money better spent."
2,could be a lot better,this guy is no elvis... plus the songs aren't very good... and they lack any soul or conviction. he seems to be going through the motions on this cd. only buy this if you are a die hard fan or you like music that will give you diarrhea.
4,"Good movie, sad Russell Wong was underused!","Bought the movie for Russell Wong, sadly he's merely but a blip in the movie. Found that disappointing, but the movie is good."
4,"I did like this movie, it isn't as bad as others say it is",If you are looking to be entertained then you probably will like this movie. It wasn't as funny from the standpoint of Brendan Frasier's character's comments as the 1st 2 movies. The action was good. The quality of the blu-ray video and audio was very good. Good use of the surrounds especially in the fight scenes and through the last 1/2 of the movie.
3,The Mummy,"It was again a full action movie , and that's my cup of tea some may beg to differ, i liked it but not as good as the other Mummy movies.Bob"
1,Watch the Scorpion King instead. Yes this is that bad.,"Completely agree with the above review, this was a horrible addition to a great series of movies. The new person playing Eve is terrible she doesn't seem to make any attempt to emulate the established character, Alex is too old and despite behaving very ""English school boy"" in the second one, growing up in England and having gone to an English University (I am pretty sure it mentions that somewhere in the film), he has turned into an American action hero. Story is near non-existent, action sequences are tame at best, the so called jokes aren't the slightest bit funny and they get Yeti's to help them. Yes Yeti's, I know we are suspending belief here that an ancient Warlord has risen from the grave and now has super powers, but Yeti's?One last thing, it is a bit of a stretch to even call this movie Mummy, since technically the ""Mummy"" wasn't mummified."
1,"Very Boring, Waste of time",I watched this movie only because it was my friends birthday party and he can't pick good movies. Makes no sense and is not entertaining. Since when do Yetis randomly come down from a mountain and wreak havoc on soldiers. I'd say this is the worst in the Mummy series
3,Movie OK but Comentary ruins it.,"I have no particular complaints on the movie. The new actress playing Evie did well. The commentary by director Rob Cohen is another matter entirely! It offends me to pay for a DVD and then have a commentator assume that means I want to hear his political views. What possible reason is there for a commentary supposedly about this movie to inlude the expression ""...my man Obama...""? NONE!!In the future, if Rob Cohen's name appears on the credits, I won't go to the movie or rent or buy the DVD. I won't enrich him so he can spout his politics on my dime!! Rant off."
3,It was okay,I wasn't a big fan of this one.I liked Jet Li but was disappointed by the absence of Rachel Weisz
2,Can I get my money and my two hours back?,"When I'm on my death bed, I'm going to want the two hours back that I wasted on this DVD."
2,Rent it.,"Presentation was great, images and sound were perfect, Story, that's where we hit a snag. Many plot holes and inconsistencies, caracters that I just did not care about (the son & new actress for Evelyn). Not even sure why Jet li was in it. Definitely rent it."
1,Not on par with the other Mummy Movies,"While I loved the first two Mummy movies, the plot for this third instalment seemed thrown together just to milk the franchise for more $$$. Rob Cohen took the directors chair from Stephen Sommers and it shows, big time. The special effects for the whole movie were as bad as they were for the end of the Mummy Returns. The Yetti looked totally CG and the signal they made of ""field goal"" made my laugh and shake my head at the same time. I wish they had written a more compelling and historically accurate story than this one as it was ALL action and had plot holes big enough for a tank to drive through. The suspense of the first Mummy movie is what made it so popular. Unfortunately, this third instalment had practically NONE. Overall it was very disappointing and definitely NOT worth purchasing."
3,Not as expected,"I am a huge fan of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. I have watched both movies like more than 20 times and still enjoy them so much!This third installment is ok. The effects are great, but like other people have commented, the dialogue is kind of slow in some parts of the movie.I am a fan of Rachel Weiz and totally missed her in this movie. No wonder why she decided not to be part of this project. Too bad also, because I am sure her presence would have made the difference, in my opinion.Definately, Jet Li and Brendan Fraser, together with John Hannah, save this movie."
2,Just plain bad...,"I was a huge fan of the first two Mummy movies. When I found out this was coming out, I was very excited. Let me first start by saying that I hate it when they have a trilogy with different actors/actresses playing the characters. (Evelyn) Other than that, the acting was bad. The story was very brief and shallow. The best part of the movie was that some parts were so bad that they became laughable. Again, I am still a big fan of the first two. This movie just seems like they threw this together and did not work on it very much. It might be worth renting for Jet Li's martial arts but that is about it."
2,Pointless...,"What a waste of time. Rachel Weisz is gone, Jet Li sleepwalks through the role (with what little screen time he actually has), and the plot is very predictable. Save your money, trust me."
4,"If you're new to Information Technology, this is a great buy","As a student new to the IT world, I found this book extremely useful as a supplement to the class textbook. Brian breaks down ""computerese"" into layman's terms. I really appreciated Brian's humor, especially after studying for a couple of hours! I don't think I would have passed the certification test without this book. In fact, with the help of the next book in this series, I've just passed the Server test!"
4,FY fan's dream,"i found this is a store and just HAD to buy it. it was worth it too. this is a great movie for anyone out there who's seen the 1st series. just when you think everything is resolved and miaka and tamahome are gonna live happily ever after, something new happens. the only reason that i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two scenes. the first might not be good for little kids (but then again, there were scenes in the original FY series that might not have been good for little kids...) and also because of a scene where... well, i REALLY don't want to give anything away but some bad stuff happens to my favorite character (well, let's see here, who could that be?). let me just say that this is a great movie and well worth any amount of money."
2,Squished!,"It was great to see more FY! And everyone was very true to form. As always, the question of Tamahome and Miaka being allowed to stay together is on everyone's minds. (I thought that was already answered!) The omake theater at the end of each episode is a lot of fun. But it seemed like there was a very long story arc squished into just a few episodes. Unless you're desparate, be patient for the manga to be translated! It is coming--slowly but surely."
1,very disappointed,"I thought I was purchasing a radio controlled truck. Wrong...it is a clear plastic cut out that you paint, put stickers on and need to add to a radio controlled wheels, motor etc. VERY MISLEADING photograph!!!!"
3,Product Great; Shipping Not So Great,"Poster itself is nice, but arrived with packaging severely bent and damaged, resulting in a poster with a number of deep creases. Have been unable to straighten these out so far (over a period of several weeks) so I have a noticeably very wrinkly poster.Considering that nobody else seems to sell this particular poster, though, I'll be keeping it."
4,Cosby abbreviated,The Cosby show is a wonderment and having these ten great episodes is a joy.....wish more groups of the great episodes would be made....I love the show but cannot afford to buy the entire series..tho I would like to. Come on somebody in Carsey/Werner distribution.....make a few more DVDs of the great episodes...!!!
4,The best of Cosby show,Good idea to put all the best on one dvd. This built up to the last episode which was definitely the best but there were other good ones too.
5,I love it,"I never enjoyed driving my jeep as much I did after installing this muffler. The sound is not too loud and although it didn't transform my YJ into a Camaro, but it made a difference in performance and it's performing much better on highways and off road.I'll try to upload a video showing the muffler and also how it sounds later on.I am extremely satisfied with the price and the performance of this muffler."
1,Just this side of worthless.,"This is not a study guide for SCJP 5.0 as you will quickly learn when you view the section on generics. The SCJP test contains a significant number of questions on generics, the most dramatic change to Java in a decade. This book but two paragraphs on that important topic and neither paragraph is worth reading. If you want to fail SCJP, then use this book as your primary information source."
3,Disappointing,This book is good as far as it goes but it does not go into much depth. For a newcomer to financial statemeents it would be very useful but for someone with any experience it will not teach much that is new. If you know more than the very basics you need to look elsewhere.
5,Very funny!,"The author is sharp witted, which sometimes makes him enemies. The book is fast paced, which can only make him friends. Crispy is funny, original, and just great entertainment. Smoky and Spider invent things out of the blue, and at some point you almost want them get caught by bad Chuck.I bought this book because I know the author, not personally, but from reading his diatribes on various message boards. I like where he's coming from, rock bands and all, and I just adore his capacity to rave and rant and say anything outrageous while always staying true to basic issues like love and loyalty. H.B. Marcus is a good man who wrote a good book. Both the author and his work are highly recommended!"
3,pricey media drive for HP desktops,"This product is over priced, but there are no alternatives if you want to mount the drive in the built in bay of some HP desktops. If you don't mind using a USB cable and a power cord, there are any number of cheaper alternatives available. Warranty is also shorter than other similar products."
4,Nice little Hard Drive...,"Great external hard drive especially for media. With Windows Media Connect, streaming music and videos to my Xbox 360 is very quick unlike my previous hard drive, which was a Maxtor. The only small draw back would be that there is no power switch on the on the drive itself. I think it would be useful for non-HP computers since the drive cannot be plugged into the computer itself. But that is minor compared to the great bargain for a 500 GB capacity drive that Amazon is offering. So its definitely a great buy..."
1,NOT WORKING AND NO HELP FROM HP,"Hi,Three days ago I purchased a HP Pavilion Media Center m8300f Desk top PC and the PERSONAL MEDIA DRIVE hd5000s (500GB).IT DOES NOT WORK IN THE COMPUTER AT ALL INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY.It does work on my Window XP externally.IF any of you have a working internal Personal Media Drive please let me know what you did or if you added any files and which ones. I have already added Rioxo.exe and done several elementary procedures suggested by HP. None help. I did retrieve some information from the HP Web Site stating there if a setup disk which has to be run for the DRIVE to be recognized as a Personal Media Drive. The drive is recognized by my computer by as K:\ and can not be used. I receive an error message box: ""Location Not Available, K:\ is not accessible, Error Performing inpage operation.""I contacted HP four (4) times and no one seems to be aware of this problem nor do they have a solution. HELP HELP."
1,Problems with this drive,"I bought this drive thru Amazon on Sept. 18, 2008 and it stopped working on January 9, 2009, just a few days past the 3 month warranty period. I get message that the drive is not recognized, try disconnecting it and reconnecting it, and if it still does not work replace it. I tried this and also, connecting it with the external power source and also tried it on another computer. My computer says that the drive is malfunctioning. I am very disappointed. I do have 3 other HP personal media drives, 160, 500, and a 750, and so far they are still working. Two are older that the one that stopped working. Of course, it is past the 30 day return period with Amazon and it is several days pass the warranty period with HP."
4,Garage-fuzz from Downunder,"This Australian trio kicks out the fuzz-guitar garage jams with real power. In addition to the general it's-great-to-be-rockin' vibe, there are shades of the freedom wrought by '60s stalwarts like The Leaves, Standells, and Stones, and neo-garage acts like The Lyres, Chesterfield Kings, and Stems (the latter not coincidentally lead singer Dom Mariani's previous band). There's a helping of power-pop here too, with the band sounding like the Plimsouls on ""Your Greed,"" and the Bo Diddley styled ""I'm For You"" a worthy exposition of one of rock's primal rhythm. The Creation's ""Biff Bang Pow"" provides the album's sole cover, and shows off another of the band's influences. Alive's U.S. reissue of the original Aussie release replaces the track ""Someone Else's Bubblegum"" with ""I'm For You."" The Stoneage Hearts don't try to remodel the garage, but for those who simply love the focused buzz of pre-psychedelic rock, this is a great ticket. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
5,Good self publishing reference,"This book contains some of the same information as Don Poynter's other book, ""Self Publishing Manual"". However, its all organized alphabetically for easy reference. This book works very well when used in conjunction with ""Self Publishing Manual"", as it allows you to quickly review the piece of information that you know you read from the manual. A useful book."
2,"This could be a Spy Flick or a Horror film,Aww Shucks---Its both !","Starring: Brian Anthony.OKAY,It's cold when they made this flick and that's nice given this spring heat wave we are having.It's got some Zombie aka Wendigo jump to the gore violence and Then some really cool hitman/spy/opposing governments approach to alot of hand-to-hand and gun play.Very likable cast,Who had us believing especially B. A. and Cheyenne King.Maybe alittle confusing with plot devices,But enjoyable for sets,acting and those effects of violence."
2,Love to Dance,This CD is not good. It's a nonstop pulsating beat with almost no lyrics. I was hoping for something similar to the DMA compilation tapes. This is not it.
3,personal review,I purchased book for my grandson's biology project. I found the subject matter informative.
2,A good overview but lacked details,"James put together a comprehensive review of Netware 5, but the book lacks details for implementation. If one is looking for a overview of Netware 5 this is the book."
1,Good for newbies,The content of this book is a review of NetWare 4.x and gives you some glimpses of the changes in NetWare 5. Certain areas are well written such as the setup of DHCP and DNS. Products that install on top of NetWare 5 (i.e. Bordermanager) are discussed but lack detail.
1,poor cd,"This cd is not the original tracts, the song list is out of order and the songs are mislabled when you select them."
4,Great sound,"The track listing is all weird like the other guy said, but I think the songs are all original recording. I am very pleased with this cd."
5,gorgeous hero,"When Ramon di Crianza Perez emerges from the Mediterranean ocean wearing nothing but a pair of black bathing shorts to cover his powerful Latin body, Annalisa Wilson isn't the only one who is drooling.Susan Stephens sure knows how to grab the reader's attention and i will definitely be looking out for her next book."
2,This author is trying too hard.,"I've now read 2 books by this author, & I think she creates overly elaborate romances based upon really unrealistic plot devices. I think she could write a good Harlequin if she'd only simplify her plots & make her characters less flat. They don't have any distinguishing characteristics; it's just about unbelievable sexual attraction. You can have that in a Harlequin but Geez, give the characters something else too. Otherwise it's a waste of time. This book: it's dull and slow. I don't think I'll try anything else by this author."
3,Poor quality for such an expensive text.,I bought this book for a course I'm now taking. I've been reading it for 5 weeks now and the cover and spine are separating. Very poor quality for a text that sells for well over $100.
5,Excellent book,I found this book to be very informative and useful. Is is a must for Psoriasis patients.
3,Only 2 months following,I only saw slight improvement after following the diet. However a sunburn seemed to hinder progress. I also suspect my work environment playing a role in slowing progress.
1,did not work for me,"I was desperate to try something natural that would clear my psoriasis. My husband is a physician and was skeptical of me trying this diet out, but said that he would support me. The problem with this diet is that there are too many ""loop holes"" in which Dr. Pango can say, ""well, you didn't do this"" etc. I read the book, multiple times over, took notes, and still found it impossible to figure out exactly what I was supposed to be eating on a regular day. As with most forms of deception, this book is confusing and contradicting at points. It is aimed at people who are desperate and willing to try anything. I ate grapes for three days, took spoon fulls of olive oil, enemas, everything - nothing worked. I do believe that certain foods may cause flare ups, but this crazy confusing strict and weird diet will not cure your skin. Save your money and go out to a nice dinner - this chiropractor is not going to heal your psoriasis"
5,Great interplay,I found the interplay between the characters extremely entertaining. It is funny and pokes a lot fun at the elitist snobs.
1,"Very small, not the standard 69 ml size.","This is not the standard 69 ml size.It is some kind of demo, like a perfume sample.I have returned the item. Seems cheap, but it may well be the most expensive deal, and when you add shipping, you end up paying three times more for the same amount of ink."
3,prolific reader,I have the complete sets of Terri Blackstock's books. I loaned them out to friends and did not get one back. Thank goodness Amazon.com had a seller that had the book I needed to recomplete my set.
5,Great read,This book arrived in great condition on time. The experiences and observations are full of wisdom and are world changers. I highly recommend it.
4,A chilling tale from one of the original horror writers,"""At the Mountains of Madness"" still proves an engaging, tense read over 70 years after its initial publication. The one issue some may have with the story is the lack of dialogue throughout its pages, but with vivid description and playing with the sense of the unknown and mysterious, the story provides a gripping, self-building story that is sure to please most who read it."
1,needs perspective,"One review says this book is ""Part critical history, part personal memoir, part celebration, and part meditation."" This is accurate - though some parts are larger than others. The critical history is very interesting - but the personal memoir, which dominates the book, is not. Gitlin has a lot of interesting and incisive things to say, but he dwells far too much on boring minutiae like who Tom Hayden's girlfriend was in different months."
2,Fun for 2 to 3 hours.,"This game was pretty fun for 2 or 3 hours and hten it really went down hill. There are no where near enough modes and the single player campaign is really uninspired and way too easy. Multiplayer was pretty lame as their is really no difference between each game, if you do A and B And C you always win.I would not recommend this game"
3,"Good, but not as before","The game was fun to play. However, it did not match against the previous Warhammers that I have played."
4,one of the better Sisters tributes,"As of this writing, there are 5 different tribute CDs devoted to the Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps this is to be expected, given that the Sisters themselves have not released a proper album in over a decade. This release from Sweden, as you may have guessed, consists largely of deep-voiced bands with metal overtones to their music. Considering the competition, though, I thought all the music here was very enjoyable. The track listing:1. Poison Door - Bay Laurel2. Some Kind of Stranger - Mist Of Avalon3. Alice - Mobile Mob Freakshow4. Floorshow - Headtrip Inc.5. Body and Soul - Funhouse6. Vision Thing - Sex Sex Sex7. Body Electric - Dawn Of Oblivion8. On a Wire - Sons Of Neverland9. Lucretia My Reflection - Dan Swanö10. First and Last Always - Darkside Cowboys11. Something Fast - Snow Storm12. Temple of Love - DesireIf you are looking for something good to listen to while holding your breath until the new Sisters album is released, you have found it."
4,Cuisinart Raclette maker,Great product. Easy to use and clean. Only issue is length of cord - requires extension cord to work on table top.
1,"Same story, different size. Frost King stinks, buy 3M Scotch","What can I add that hasn't been said a few dozen times by others on this site? Frost King makes a cheap product that won't last an hour, doesn't seal drafts, doesn't create a clear sealed treatment, and the tape is so bad everything falls off in an hour. STAY AWAY from Frost King products. On the other hand, 3M Scotch is awesome, and is a classic example of why some things cost more: they're worth it. Do not buy Frost King EVER, stick with 3M Scotch."
1,Tape Doesn't Stick to Plastic,"I've been putting plastic window insulation up every winter for years using Frost King Kits and have never had an issue until this year. In the past, the tape rolls were more than enough and I always had left-over tape. When I started covering windows this year, I started out with last year's tape and those windows are holding up fine. However, ALL of the window insulation I've put up using the new tape has fallen off by the next day. It is VERY frustrating and I feel that I've completely wasted both time and money. I'm going to try and finish my windows with 3M insulation and hope it works better."
3,There's a better product,"Having just used both the Frost King and the 3M product in the same week, I feel qualified to tell you the difference. Frost King is cheaper and probably insulates as well as 3M but here is the difference. The Frost King had hard folds in the plastic sheeting and lots of them. Those fold lines did not come out when heated. The view is therefore not as clear through the window. The 3M product was folded with soft folds not hard creases. After heating with the hair dryer that window looks so clear it's hard to believe there is a plastic sheet covering it. Not so with the Frost King. If you are just covering basement or garage or attic windows go for it. Otherwise, spend the extra bucks for 3M."
1,Not worth the money!,"I purchased a number of Frost King window insulation kits.The double-sided tape sticks fine to the window frame but the film will fall off the tape in about 7 days.Had the film fall off the tape on 14 windows I had done.Not quite a money saver at all!Contacted Frost King and they replaced the defective product but the replacement didn't work either.Ended up taking the remaining packages back to the store for a refund.Until they find the problem with why the film won't stick to the tape, I refuse to buy another Frost King product.Never had any trouble with 3M, but you pay a little more for that.Like they say"" You get what you pay for"".Avoid Frost King products and you'll avoid frustration!"
1,Seriously not worth it,I heard the author on a local radio station and thought the book would be somewhat helpful or useful. It is not. Mostof it was jargon you have heard before and don't need to read. It was a complete waste of MONEY.
2,Mediocre,"This is a very mediocre movie. I'm not surprised it didn't find a distributor, despite having a pretty stellar cast, which includes Eli Wallach, Isabella Rosellini, Rita Moreno and Beverly D'Angelo."
5,Bose quality sound for your computer,I'll make this short and sweet. They are very cool high end speakers from Bose. There are very few systems out there that will provide the same performance let alone the elgance amd simplicity that Bose provides in all its products.
1,Duveen,"This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book."
5,Great phone,We have purchased 4 of them for our business Hyperlinks Web Sites. They are great phones. Would def recommend.
3,Might appeal to fans,"This is the first book I've read by James Herbert, and it was ok. I think it could have been spookier, and the sex bits were a bit too graphic for my tastes. Kind of like watching one of those SciFi channel orginal movies. If you're in the mood for the premise or a fan of the author, you'll prolly enjoy it."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"But I can't say that I did. I Plan on giving it to my Husband to read and believe his opinion may differ from mine. I don't say it's Bad or poorly written but I consider it A MAN BOOK. I couldn't identify with any female character and felt alienated by the Fairie heroine. I remember all too well the kiddie porn of David Winters ""Art Photography"" and don't welcome it's return! And ,of course, the wiccan was dark ,adult & evil. What More need to be said?..."
3,"Slow,slow,quick,quick,slow","I found that this book kept me interested but wasn't great. It was certainly unsettling in parts, but not nearly as scary as The Dark, The Survivor and his classics. I would also say that the end was disappointing, unless there is more to come...."
5,This is the MBA book to get!,"MBA in a nutshell is the absolute ""gold standard"" when it comes to understanding the essence of the MBA in book form. What I received in four years of night school at one of the top-rated schools in the country, Dr. Sobel has boiled down and provided in this book, in a way that actually makes getting this MBA enjoyable. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to fully experience an MBA without spending the time and money in a classroom. I would also recommend it as a refresher for anyone who's passed through the MBA program at any of the top schools - Harvard, Yale, Wharton or NYU - and in need of a refresher to remind them what the MBA is really all about."
5,santa on a tree,Excellent - fun item - for hanging round a tree before Christmas for the kids (and Adults).Not too expensive either and has many years of use.
2,Would be good for single-parent mothers,"This is an okay story for potty training. Yes, it is a chamberpot and not a modern-looking potty, but my 25 month old had no problem understanding that it is a potty. I like the story. The only complaint, though it is a big one, is from my husband. He is a very active father and doesn't like this story because it's all about ""I, Prudence's mother"" and there is no father in the story. So this would be good for a single mother, but not for a two-parent family working on potty training. We also bought ""My Big Girl Potty"" by Joanna Cole, and he likes that better because BOTH mom and dad help with potty training."
2,not what I expected,"I bought the book to help my daughter with potty training but we (my husband and I) found it a little to explicit for such young children, I could have done without the little girl bent over telling us this is where the poop comes out, I've recently gotten a few other books that do a much better job without being so, well gross. I wouldn't recommend this one over any other potty training books."
3,Just ok....,"I think it gives kids the general idea, but it really didn't hold either of my girls' interest. My 3 year old trained at 2 1/2 and I don't think the book helped her at all. My 2 year old is just getting ready to train and she really has no interest in the book. I was thinking about finding something a little more appealing to help her out. I think I'd keep looking....."
4,Good illustrations,"The text is a bit too much, but the illustrations are good and we just make up our own words to go along with them."
1,Very disappointing,"Even though I bought this one used for [price]- I was very disappointed in the content. The ""potty"" pictured in this book is actually an ""urn"" like bowl that does not look even vaguely like any of the potty chairs that children are using currently. No matter how well it is written, my daughter (20 months old) will not relate this picture to her potty chair which makes this story worthless.Sorry I wasted [money] plus shipping and handling!"
2,Not age-appropriate,"I thought this book was too long and involved for my 18 month old. She won't sit still long enough to read it through. I like ""The Potty Book - For Girls (or Boys)"" better as it is shorter but still gets the point across. This book would be good if you were potty-training a three year old..."
1,Poor rating from my toddler,"We have several potty books for little girls, and ""Once Upon a Potty"" by far is not one that my daughter ever picks up to have me read to her. In fact, we've had this book for almost a year now and I think I've only read it to her twice. My daughter just pushes the book away when I pick it up for us to read. The illustrations are dark and not at all brightly colored or interesting. And like the other review listed here, my daughter calls the potty in this book a cup. I bought this book online, and only after reading xlnt reviews. If I had seen it at our local bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Not all it is cracked up to be,"I bought this book, knowing it was an award winning book, but was very disappointed. The vocabulary is clumsy, as is the language. It also is a bit strange, and not terribly captivating for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter. The pictures are lovely though...."
3,Once Upon A Potty Girl,This book is just ok. It talks from the mom's point of view which I thought was strange. It is kind of graphic. My daughter did like it but the potty in the thing is shaped like some weird dish. There are better books out there.
3,"Has its moments, but save me from DENSE naivete!","On the whole, the story is okay. However, I found the Queen STUPIDLY and dangerously NAIVE, BLIND, or CLUELESS--whichever you prefer! She does absolutely NOTHING, and in fact, DOESN'T EVEN KNOW when people are challenging her authority, or that there are spies everywhere, and that there's a bloody conspiracy going on beneath her very nose! In spite of ALL the MANY, MANY clues pointing to treason by the Cardinal, she needs to have the other ""2"" staring her right in the face and she still can't come up with ""4""! WHY? BECAUSE THAT ""4"" HAS TO SPEAK UP!!!"
3,Dragon Floormats,"The price is great, but they do begin to pill, or fuzz, quite quickly. The design stays true, but the black base begins to pull up. I think that even with that problem they will last a while, but if you want perfect looking floormats, these are not for you."
3,Good book IF you have a good knowledge base already,"I am a pharmacist who has been out of school for more than 7 years. I bought this book in hopes it would be a good concise review, since I feel like I have forgotten a lot specific disease state information that I learned in school. This book is well organized, but in general I have found it difficult to use for learning. I think this book assumes that you already have a pretty good knowledge of diseases, and uses terminology that is sometimes beyond what I remember. I also feel like it doesn't go into as much detail as I would like for drug recommendations and dosings. Overall, I would not buy again. If you're still in school, this would probably be a great concise book to use along with your big Dipiro. But for someone like me, whose disease knowledge isn't as strong as it used to be, this book is just frustrating."
5,PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED AND ENTERTAINED,"Mr. Bob Drake's new novel is intelligent, exciting and engrossing. The story line is wonderful and the characters draw you in...deep. Prepare for some strong language, but it's all appropriate for the horrors of Viet Nam. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; a 2 day read. Quick, page-turning details and phenomenal, dark comedy await you. Enjoy."
3,"My toddler loves it, but the narration is irritating!","My 2-1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD, and all of the others as well. I can actually enjoy it myself, as it can be mesmerizing. However, what I don't enjoy about this video, compared to the other volumes, is the kid that narrates it. He talks way too much and it's just irritating. I hope this companys' future videos leaves out the kid!"
3,Sometimes you feel like vanilla,"Huey Lewis and the News is well, who wouldn't buy them a beer? Having a couple of pops might even be more fun than listening to their music. Which isn't to say that it's bad, it's just well, kinda plain. This first one's ok. It's was charming and mildly entertaining. You could play it when you're having friends over for a barbecue and you weren't sure what everyone wouldn't mind hearing. They sound like some house painters who got a band and gigged around the city. No one wore their limitations on their sleeves quite like The News."
4,News' Debut,"Huey Lewis & The News' self titled debut album is a solid, workman like effort that laid down the blueprint that the band would follow to the top of the charts in the mid 80's. The album is full of no nonsense songs that have a rock, r&b and pop mixture with perfect harmonies. The album isn't as polished as their later efforts, but Mr. Lewis' appealing vocals and the band's loose and enthusiastic playing makes this a fun effort. ""Trouble in Paradise"" is the most famous song from the album (thanks to a live version that appeared on the We Are The World album) and is great songs as are ""Some Of My Lies Are True"", ""Hearts"", ""Stop Trying"" and ""Who Cares""."
1,Typhoon Colander was a disappointment,"I purchased this very cute colander for the size and design six weeks ago. It arrived slightly dented, but I was able to push the dent out. I thought it was strange that it was so flexible and that the colander had a warning to 'handwash only'--it seemed very flimsy. I followed the directions, but within five weeks of normal usage, the enamel began to flake off and it started to rust. Unless you are purchasing this colander as a display item only, I would not recommend it."
4,book art,"The book creates an exciting panorama of our urban spaces. It is similar to the first book published by Zone Books, which also uses photos and essays. I think the book is best viewed as ""book art"". It repesents the urban experience as overwhelming in a somewhat distanced way. Keeping in mind that it focuses with an almost bleak view of cities and consumer culture(we don't see a lot of pictures of parks, clean streets, or ""nice"" things about cities), I still recommend it."
2,Very Disappointed,"With the cultural diversity of our neighborhoods today, I thought a book like this was a great idea. I expected that the author would be respectful of the different religions he's chosen to write about. That wasn't the case. Throughout this thin tome, the author has chosen to pontificate on the weaknesses of each major religion as it compares to his own Christianity. Of course, this is all opinon. His opinion. From this book, I gather we should be afraid of our non-Christian neighbors because they harbor ulterior motives and are vastly inferior. Anyone looking for a primer on the basic tenets of the world's major religions done in a respectful, all inclusive manner better look elsewhere. This small minded volume does nothing to foster undersatnding and acceptance in a multi-cultural environment."
2,Keep shopping...,"It has one really nice feature, the work light. I was out late at night working on my tractor and this light was heaven sent (no pun intended). The bad news is that after pumping up 3 tires on my kids bicycles, the compressor was noticeably slowing down. That bites if you have 10 tires that you need to inflate like I usually do. I had no problem whatsoever returning it and the seller said this behavior was unusual. One of the first casualties of moving manufacturing offshore was quality control (actually the USA was just average at it). So I could have just gotten a bad unit."
3,Slow and noisy compressor,I was going to use this as an electronic device dust blow off device. But it does not produce enough air flow without an additional surge tank.
1,Paper weight,Great Idea. good name. I thought. Worthless product.Worked twice then gave up the ghost. Will think twice before purchasing another coleman productMike
2,pretty weak,"i love layne, as well as the rest of aic, jerry, mike, sean..the book barely talks about layne at all. the author talked about colombia and drug markets, mike starr's book, and other useless stuff that is irrelevant to learning more about laynes ""heart and soul"" as said in the title. the material on layne is good, and i like the dialogues from the recordings of layne's family the author use. also, the author repeated a lot of stuff such as a certain quote from layne about ""don't they hear the words..,"" calling demri layne's ""one and only love"" a thousand times..and other junk like that that makes it boring"
1,Adriana Rubio=Hack,"If your thinking of buying this book, don't. You would gain much more insight about Layne and his life by listening to the music of AIC than this book could ever offer. Adriana Rubio, you are nothing more than a hack. Go back to what ever it was you were doing before you started ""writing"".W~"
3,"Only 4 true fans, and in the authors eyes","Got it for Christmas last yr. I liked it, big fan of AIC. The author gets lost in her own world whether it be real or imaginary. No one will ever know exactly what happened to this talented singer, and do we really need decriptive details on this tragedy. If your a fan, you know the voice of Layne will never be replaced, and what he did with his personal life is not for anyone's review."
3,i found the book to be.......................,i have been a fan of alice in chains and of layne staley for years. when i heard that there was a book out about layne i wanted to read it. i had heard that it was made by interviews with layne his mom and his sister. i wanted to read what layne said most of all. i had bought the book and sat down to read it. i found the book to be boring. layne was hardly interviewed for the book. there is a part where layne calls adriana and tells her how much pain he is in and that he knew that he was about to die. that is about it from layne the rest is from his mother and sister. then adriana gose on about drugs in the united states and how it has become a problem.i just found the book boring.
3,Not just for Christians!,"I was a bit skeptical of this book at first, as our family are Satanists and the title implys it's strictly for Christians. However, I'm happy to say that this is not the case at all! I simply blacked out all referrences to Jesus or The LORD with a sharpie, changed the name to Lucifer, and ""whalla"", problem solved.Thank you, Maxwells, for helping me combine my love of homeschooling with my worship of the Dark Lord. Hail Satan!"
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I came so close to not ordering this book because of the reviews. But this was a recommended book from a women's conference I'd gone to, and I really wanted to check it out, but I put it off.After venturing to another's website (a woman I greatly admire who has lots of kids and homeschools), I noticed SHE used this system and again I thought, a try can't hurt...there's always resale, right?I'm sooooo glad I bought this manual! It's been great so far! Very well written, easy to read, and downright practical! One of the BEST organizational books out there for homeschool families! (And I'm picky!)I'll definitely put this book up there with my favorites, right next to my ""FlyLady"" collection--another great book for organization, even if you're NOT a homeschooler.Really though, even if you're not a homeschooling family, this manual is great! Give it a try...as I mentioned earlier, if you don't like it, there's always resale!"
2,I wanted to like this album...,"...but ultimately couldn't!!!!Agree with the other reviewers that ""Paul Gaugin"" is an excellent addition to the Jimmy Webb canon, but the remainder of the album is simply not up to scratch - and I say this from the perspective of one who considers ""Ten Easy Pieces"" one of my favourite albums of all time.The other 2-3 strong songs on the album, in my opinion, are all done better on Michael Feinstein's magnificent ""Only One Life"" album of last year, recorded with Jimmy. Maybe Jimmy should have kept some of his creativity for his own recording, rather than selflessly giving it to Michael...So - save your money with this album, but definitely buy Ten Easy Pieces and Only One Life instead!!!"
2,Disappointed in quality of templates,"This thin quality paperback includes six pages of small templates for iris folding and other elements used to create greeting cards. However, the templates for iris folding do not include numbered instructions. So, in addition to having to photocopy the templates, you need to keep the book next to you in your workspace to follow the instructions on where to position your paper strips."
1,black and white,"wasn't aware what black & white actually was when my daughter asked for it, about demonic forces and negative spiritual warfare...more faith filled Christians should unite against such games"
1,WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"I had to do a book report on a book and all of my friends said that Nancy Drew was the best book ever. So I picked it up and started reading it and it was horrible! No one should ever buy this book. The person who wrote it should not be allowed to write any books. There is no story to it. The book is horribly written. They put the wrong words in sentences. WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN, NEVER BUY IT!!!!!"
2,One death too many,"Dead Clever engaged me for the first third, then I realized I didn't like where it seemed to be going: a few too many implausible events. But I came across the ""word puzzle"" and my interest was temporarily piqued. Oh, well, for the next evening I omitted half the book by skipping to the last 20-some pages. The ending confirmed I should be reading a better novel by someone else. And Dead Clever is a title chosen by two other writers. A pity."
1,very bad print by vertigo,as usual vertigo printed this on extremely thin recycled toilet paper. thanx to the bad paper quality the colors arent as they should be. as i can see it is a new trend for vertigo... using the cheapest paper available and ripping people off. i think this is the last book by this publisher i bought.
5,good cd,I like this album a lot but comparing it to noFX is just stupid. there good but not as good as noFX.
5,This might just be the best 90's punk cd ever!!!!!,"The Unseen are an amazing band!!!! Lower Class Crucifixion is a truly awesome album. My favorite songs are...Children of the Revolution, Too Young to Know,The Unseen Class, and A.D.D. All of the songs on the c.d. are amazing though. They are an awesome band to see live, so check them out! They are currently on tour right now. They also have a new cd ""So this is Freedom"" coming out soon. So if you don't have Lower Class Crucifixion yet buy it right now!!!!"
4,An inspiring book of overcomers,"I love this book! Each person has a different story of how they have taken a tragic or difficult life circumstance, and created purpose and meaning from it. It shows that sometimes our ""curses"" are really blessings in disguise, and gives hope to anyone who might think life has given them more than they can handle."
4,Get it for the last tracks,"The album overall is so-so... The first several tracks sound like standard hip-hop fare. However, ""Season of the Unexplained"" is very good, merging some good lyrics and beats, along with some Middle Eastern/Indian influences. It works really well.The real gem of the album, though, is the last track. ""Angels Holdin Heat"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard... Simple, just a violin over a background beat, but it's oh-so delicious. Crank up the bass, close your eyes, and just soak it in. The album is worth getting just for this track."
1,Defective on arrival,"The item arrives defective. It was not able to read any DVDs and even CDs. Moreover, the power button was jamed. I needed to use my nails to release it.I will not buy anymore Mustek product... Too cheap!Be aware that even if you are returning a defective unit, Amazon will not cover the Shipping cost :("
4,A Great Doo with some focus on Velma for a change,"This movie harkens back more to the days when Velma carried the group more.Lots of Mummies, lots of swerves, not too convoluted, and just enough Scooby and Shaggy freaking out.Great movie."
1,Durability of the Bike Light,"The overall product was as described, although after three days on the bike, in and out of some light rain, and overnight condensation buildup, this product stops working. I was very disappointed with the durability of the product. I loved them for a whole three days!"
1,Tremendously Bad,"In keeping with the spirit of this book, ""Attitude is Everything"" excels in being trite. It is tremendously bad. It is fantastically poor.Take every cliche you've ever heard, wrap it into a book and that's what you've got here.No offense to the author and his achievements, but let me save you the time and sum up the main theme of the book-- think happy thoughts."
5,Another fabulous LATHER product,I don't think you can ever go wrong with a LATHER product--at least I haven't yet. Awesome smell and highly effective at smoothing rough skin on feet. I use this regularly with the bamboo lemongrass foaming body scrub. Highly recommend.
5,Tres Magnifique!,"What an emotional whirly-bird this disc is! Alternately soaring and rumbling, sometimes silly, occasionally sinister. Fersen blends styles from around the spectrum into a fun stew. There is a bit of Tom Waits in here, some gypsy, some Bal Musette, some jazz, some tango. Some highlights: Bucephal - a drunken carnival that lurches along on high-octane accordian. Les Papillons -- almost nostalgic vintage French lounge music. Moi Qui Me Croyant un Saint -- cigarette-stained Waitsian yearnings.I understand almost none of the lyrics (it is all in French), but no matter. This album transports you into Fersen's world. I'm not sure what all the rules may be in that world, but it's a great place to hang out for a while."
1,This book is racially offensive,"I decided to take a look at this book, and was very sad that I did. It is so amazingly racist I could not believe some of the things written in here could be published! For instance, he sais that it's the Jew's own faults they were in ghettos. He sais that there were a lot of Jewish communists, so the massacre of Polish Jews should not be considered a racial issue.At many points in this book, I felt like I was reading neo-nazi propaganda. I was very offended as I read this, and I strongly advise you not buy this book."
3,not satisfactory as i expected,"the book is supposed to be new, but when i received it, i feel a little disappointed. because the corners of the book are damaged and it looks like a second-hand book from its cover... nevertheless, the inside of the book don't have any problem as it don't have a single mark."
2,"Superficially looks OK, but...","This is a rampling, disorganized and idiosyncratic history. Further, the author's biases taint his presentation. If you want a superior volume check out J.M. Roberts."
1,IDIOT'S GUIDE TO HISTORY,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers, Oliver Kamm, especially about the capsule ""Genocide"". This book is easy to read but was probably easier to write. It is too superficial and still full of errors. The relative emphasis on subjects are unbalanced. This book may meet the expectations of tourists before their trip to Europe, particularly if they don't care about the reliability of information. As a result I regret buying this biased, subjective and concentrated book of European history."
5,Amazing Despite Flaws,"I understand that not everybody is happy with Davies handling of certain subjects. I would ask that people understand that bias is unavoidable. Davies does have his preferences, but I challenge anyone to find an historian who doesn't. And speaking of biases, how about every history of europe published in my lifetime, which put the British isles as the focal point for European history, For an American, raised on Anglo-centric histories of ""Europe"", this is a treasure. Davies locates the hub of Euro history as close as anyone has in the English language-in central europe. The author also does a great service by setting the record straight on some sensitive and often distorted issues.I didn't read this book cover to cover. I use it as a reference, or just dive into some random chapter and start reading.An amazing job by the author."
3,Europe: History,"I think that Europe is tough to cover in just one book but this one makes a worthy attempt. Some of the points of view seem slanted but still interesting just the same. On this score, Davies would not be unique. But in telling the history of Europe with this approach, he has undertaken a topic of so enormous a scope such that the scholarship would have to be breathtakingly manifest and the arguement would have to be breathtakingly persistant and persuasive. And he pulls it off. What emerges is a wonderfully constructed version of European history that seems connected across time and space. I found myself both stimalated and inspired. others who have approached these topics. I surmise that his view of history is that it is an argument to be waged, about the larger patterns and the more subtle threads, rather than a simple telling of the episodes and icons which later political entities have enshrined into myths that serve the ends of governance."
5,Succulent History,"I really loved this book, I could hardly put it down, although it was a bit hard to read in the bath. It was one of the most interesting histories of Europe I've ever read, the inclusion of Eastern European content was particularly welcome, as this was an area that I knew almost nothing about. It was a fasinating broad overview of a subject that had appeared to have been picked to death. Humorous, witty and immediate with some novel presentation in the form of the authors information ""capsules"". Thumbs up from a non-academic."
2,Not for Beginners,"I acquired this book with no knowledge of European History. I read almost all of it before finally giving up. I would not recommend this book for those with no background in the subject. I believe the author's expertise impedes his ability to communicate the subject to the novice. The level of detail seemed to overwhelm and confuse the big picture. As a novice, I had a hard time sorting out salient facts and assembling them to create a coherent overview of the subject. I have since read some other books that were vastly superior in effectively communicating the basics of the subject.If you have a degree in History this book may be fulfilling. If you are just trying to get a general handle on the topic try J.M. Roberts ""History of Europe"" instead. Also check out ""A History of the Middle Ages"" by Joseph Dahmus"
2,"Knowledegable writer, but too much a show-off","I'm surprised by the many favorable reviews - I find this book clumsily organized and unnecessary in many of its details. I have no doubt that Professor Davies knows what he's writing - but engaging in this book is like entering a labyrinth, and ultimately one's more assured of the tremendous brain power of the writer than what he is trying to write about the history of Europe."
5,Cool fashion book,This book is cool. Vogue is definitely the place to see all the latest and greatest fashion trend and the art of photograhing and show them.
2,Somewhat dissappointed...,"The best recipes to cook at home? I found them a bit complicated for 'home' recipes. And I had hoped for more of NOLA traditional fare knowing the authors roots & connections to the NOLA scene.I grew up in NOLA as did my mother and her family going back generations, but my mom's home recipes were more in the american chop suey vain...she would have told you her best meals were eating out ;-)Although more 'authentic' than my mom's recipes I just wasn't overwhelmed. Reading through the book, I didn't say - wow, I want to make this...Books by Leah Chase or the Commander's Palace cookbooks inspired me more. Sorry, I went in with high expectations...Flip through it at a book store before purchasing it online to ensure you really want to purchase it."
5,Tom Fitzmorris's New Orleans Food,This is an excellent cookbook with the best Crabneat AuGrautin around - I recomend it to everyone and have bought copies as gifts for friends!
2,Poison Penn,"I hate to disagree with my fellow Amazonians, but I was supremely disappointed with F&S. It's a shame, since Penn and Hutton give great performances (especially Penn). The movie has a strong start, develops the relationship between Hutton & Penn's characters well, and offers first-rate tension in their half-baked spy escapades. However, just as their plans unravel, so does the film as it devolves into Hollywood shtick. Worst is Hutton's relationship: Lori Singer's portrayal of H's girlfriend is so wooden she barely furrows her brow when H breaks up with her.My biggest beef is with Pat Metheny's score. His overmixed, cheesy newage noodling dates the movie and makes it sound like a training video.As a DVD, F&S fares no better. There isn't even a *trailer*, much less bios or information about the people the movie is about."
2,reviews ?,"i saw this for a good price. i checked for reviews. there were all theese great reviews. whatever! the movie has prettymuch no action. the sound video actin is good, but its lonnggand sloowww. there was some good nudity. that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss. ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie. i love falcons, so there you go. i think of it as good enough to keep thats it. maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend. take this as the downside reviewso all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all that"
5,A Rare Pesonal View Before the Civil War,"One of the few accounts of the Mexican War, Kirkham's journal contains many unique descriptions of U.S. military activity. He graduated from West Point in 1842. After serving on garrison and frontier duty, he participated in the Mexican War, where he was took part in the battles at Contreras and Clmrubusco and was wounded in the battle of Molino del Rey. He was noted for gallant and meritorious conduct in the storming of Chapultepec and assisted in the capture of Mexico City. While in Mexico he was one of a party of six American officers who climbed to the summit of Popocatapetl which hadn't been climbed since the time of Cortez."
4,Best online flying sim. EVER,"There is no game that can match Crimson skys in flying shooters.Online play is great. This game IS flying Sim. Get it, its that good, even if you dont like flyers."
1,Leaky Case,"I used it for snorkeling and the camera broke due to water entering the case. I think it is not suitable for even light water activities. It is not a very tight seal so be extra careful. If it leaks once, then the camera will get water damage or stop working like mine. Maybe others will have better luck. Or even tape the seal shut or something."
5,Cat collars,"I am trying to start my own business making pet supplies and a few ""human supplies"" out of paracord, these rings are crucial for me because I make cat collars, and the other D-rings I get for my dog collars just dont work for cats, they are too big and heavy and dont fit into the much smaller 4-strand paracord I have."
3,Obviously fragile,It is very interesting looking and exactly as promised though. The pictures do not do it justice. I'd recommend being careful with it though as it doesn't look like it will last long if you don't exercise caution with it.
1,"Lousy service, although it was paid for","Did not recieve the book at all, was supposed to on August 28th, and today is September 3rd. I still have gotten nothing. This was important to me because my friend was in the Marines, and I really want this book. Her picture is in it!"
1,Hoax,"In Finkelstein's doctoral thesis, he examined the claims made in Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial, It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.And said ""Finkelstein asserted that the book was nothing more than what he now calls a ""monumental hoax"""
1,"A Sham, Contemptible.","This is the ""Must Read"" book for those who like to point out that ""The Jews only want a TINY slice of land---just look! The Arabs have so much! Why can't the Palestinians just understand and let the Jews settle in?"". For anyone who's listened over the last twenty years, this book has been thoroughly discredited, many times over. It got good reviews only in the US, where no scholars were allowed to review it. It was blasted in Britain and denounced in Israel. The ""research"" the book gets so much attention for is a jumble of out-of-context information culled from a handful of studies done mostly by Great Britain during the mandate period. When Ms. Peters isn't misquoting something, she's manufacturing her own version of the study that she then refers to again and again.There are lot's of great books out there about Palestine, the Arab land given to European and American Jews in 1948. This has never been one of them. If you think this is scholarship, you don't know scholarship."
4,"Forget the reviews, read the book!","There is fascinating research and original source material here that the author uncovered during several years of research. She claims to have changed her mind after looking into the issue. I believe her. To read this book is to be flooded with an avalanche of facts. Almost 100 pages of footnotes. And the realization that many of those debating the issue of Israel, the Palestinians, and the West Bank ignore much of history. The first casualty of any war is the truth, but the truth is that this book is worth reading for the viewpoint and hard work of the author in bringing some little-known facts to light. I have yet to see a similarly inspired work from the other side - and I've been looking..."
3,Almost there,"Although the Car Charger Adapter and Wall Charger do their job, the Crystal Clear hard shell case is not a correct fit for the Razr V3t (and possibly not for the V3m either). The cut-outs on the front of the case do not conform to the display nor to the Motorola logo. On the back side of the case, the cut-outs do not conform correcly with the phone connections (there is an extra cut-out for a connection that does not exist on the phone). The cut-out for the charger is right, which I guess is the most important, and so is the cut-out for the camera."
4,Good book for Architects.,Fantastic works of Richard Meier. This is the one that represents his styles in design. i'd recommend this for those who love the art of Architecture.
4,Guitar virtuoso and vocalist extraordinaire team up!,"Featuring the amazing guitar talents of Joe Stump and Mike Vescera's vocal virtuosity,the new opus by Reign of Terror(formerly known as Joe Stump's Reign of Terror)reaches a musical higher ground.Mike Vescera,of Loudness,Yngwie Malmsteen,Obsession,MVP,etc.,sounds fantastic adding power to the already beautifully crafted neo-classical metal that manages to avoid sounding like an imitation of Yngwie all the way."
4,Al Atkins - 'Dreams Of Avalon' (Green Tree),"Here's an Al Atkins solo CD I wasn't even aware of. Just as head-banging as some of his other releases like 'Heavy Thoughts' or 'Victim of Changes' (see my reviews of both). Tunes here that did the most for me were the skillfully-written ""Eastern Promise"", ""Coming Thick And Fast"" [you gotta love the song title alone], ""Run River Run"" and ""Left Out in The Cold"". Very good. Recommended for old school Priest fans, mate."
3,I'm glad David likes it.,"This gets three stars more for it's obscurity than for its contents. Cassidy cites this as the first album he made that he was proud of. One can't help think that his opinion rests more on his taking charge of the recordings than what was produced. Oddly, this album has the feel of what the Partridge Family would have sounded like if they were a real group and actually did record in their garage. A rinky-dink electric piano abounds on many tracks as if played by Laurie. Cassidy's vocals sound either restrained or artificially rugged. Perhaps what best sums up this album is his remake of the PF classic ""Summer Days."" It was a sweeping, majestic pop masterpiece under the guidance of Wes Farrel. Here, with Cassidy and Rick Jarrad at the helm, it is stripped of its grandeur and is merely a shadow of its former, glorious self. Cassidy states in the liner notes that this is how he always wanted it to sound. Indeed. Pride surely blinds."
3,A Glimpse Into The Marxs' Past...and Future,"Highly reminiscent of their first talkie ""The Cocoanuts"" (also originally done on Broadway) this film also holds much entertainment value, mostly from the classic ""Hooray..."" early production number; the Chico-Harpo ""entertainment"" section, culminating in Groucho's famous tale of heroism; and some sharp dialogue. Unfortunately, there are many superfluous scenes with alot of unfunny babble - perhaps this type of dialogue was interesting when heard on stage. On celluloid it can cause boredom, which I recall at the New York City revival in '74 during the attempted lampoon of ""Strange Interlude"" and Detective yarns: ""Left-handed moths..."". I would recommend ""Duck Soup"", ""Cocoanuts"", and ""Horse Feathers"" for new fans."
5,one of the best marx brothers movies ever made!,this has got to be THE funniest marx brothers movie ever made! when it played in the theaters 25 years after its original play date we were first in line to go see it...and it has lost nothing going to small screen! classic marx brothers scenes abound.
5,it can't get better than this,I agree with ruthbug that this has got to be one of the funniest movies ever! Every time I watch this movie it just cracks me up! This group of people have got to be the funniest ever. I can't get over how good these guys are. I only have 2 words for you and that is WATCH THIS. You'll really enjoy it.
4,worth picking up,"Very cool disc. The tracks are diverse, ranging from aggressive attacks with strong vocals & percussion (ie. Crushed), to tracks that are mostly doomy/droning/noisey/dark ambient atmospheres (ie. Scorched Earth). Overall this is a great amalgamation of noise & distortion, dark ambient, drum 'n bass, and some experiamentalism. I recommend picking it up! I may have to up the rating to 5 stars after spinning it a few more times."
2,didn't work at all. I think you are goingo to wast money....,"I tried to take it, but didn't work for me...I went to see Dr and got med. and That works very well."
2,"Great camera for a while, then turns into a battery-eating machine!","I received this camera as a gift and it worked well for a little over a year. Then it suddenly started to go through batteries - I would say a new set of batteries for every 20 point-and-shoot pictures taken! I contacted GE about the problem and they were aware of it. They directed me to a patch download to address the issue. The patch worked for about a day then the problem resumed. It did take some good pictures while it worked, but I wish this camera would have lasted a bit longer."
4,Nice nice nice...,It has several useful and funny applications.Low Cost.Pictures display with hihg quality on the screen.Good option for a low cost camera.
5,Pretty cool cam.,It's an ok cam for the price you pay.Load it with some powerful batteries as it will drain regular ones fast.I shoot in daylight so with the flash off and with 27k mAh batteries and it works just fine.
3,GE digital camera,"It's not my ""good"" camera, but it's perfect for the whole ""throw in the purse and go"" use. The more it zooms in, the less the resolution. It's not the camera I would take to the Grand Canyon, but it's great for running around town."
1,"Don't buy it, I returned it!","Previously to purchase, I red all the reviews: some good, some bad; still, I thought that I just needed a cheap ""easy to travel"" digital camera, and the GE seemed to be good enough for that. It is not! it is bigger than it seems, feels like a toy (it's plastic) and for a little more money, you can have a decent one, far better than this."
1,What the?....,"When I had ordered the product, it said it was ""In Stock"". After waiting for many weeks, I contacted Amazon and the buyer to cancel the order as it would not make the deadline in which I needed the product. I am now being asked to write a review on a product I never got and I had received verification on stating my order was cancelled. You figure out what my review is!"
5,GE 7MP Digital Camera,"I love the color of this camera, and I just know Amazon will be quick with this, so I can enjoy it.."
3,Good but not Great,"This was a very easy read, and generally the characterizations of Buffy and the gang were good, but the story was a little weak. The last half of the story supposedly involves a 'trial', but it's really just an opportunity for self-reflection and a bit of minor ""slayage"" on Buffy's part, with no real point or relationship to what she's supposed to be on trial for or what, supposedly, was to be proven.Another weak point was the use of a fairly well-known Greek goddess in a minor and subserviant role. There have been very few Buffy stories (on air or in print) involving mythological dieties, and this was the first time one was treated as little more than a magical screwdriver (i.e. a tool to move the plot along, as opposed to a significant character).If you're a fan of the series you'll probably find this story enjoyable, though not superb. If you aren't already a fan I'd recommend starting with either Halloween Rain, Child of the Hunt, Immortal or the Gatekeeper Trilogy."
2,Expected Better,I really didn't enjoy anything about this book. The plot was suprisingly boring and the characters didn't stand out as they usually did in the other stories I have read. The only reason I finished the book was because I hoped it might pick back up somehow. It didn't.My opinion: Don't bother buying.
5,This CD is awesome!,"This has to be one of the best albums I've ever purchased. It takes you through some of the best hits ever as it has many remakes, but with the Salsa/Latin groove. I love it and definately recommend it."
1,A TOTAL JOKE!!!!!!!!,"Not only a totally useless drink caddy, but a total JOKE. The caddy is unstable and swivels relentlessly spilling a drink in almost any container. Save your money!!"
5,Product well worth the $,"I bought this shaver for my husband. He just loves it. It is powerful and does not cause any redness to his chin. Also, one single charge can last for a whole week. At this price, I really think it exceeds the value."
4,A nice little purchase,"This product gives me everything I'm looking for in a razor. Think of it as a disposable electric razor....one you use everyday for X amount of months then toss. It's cheap enough to just keep buying new ones whenever you need them. I could care less about the features, I just shave my face and that's all."
1,Is it a cheap stereo or an expensive piece of garbage?,"I'd go with the garbage. The tuner is extremely hard to use because the numbers aren't aligned right, and only a few stations come in clearly on it. (My other radios all get more stations.) When playing a CD, it often skips in places that my other CD player doesn't, and sometimes even stops for no apparent reason. The only good point of it is that it has nice, big numbers, but I don't it's worth buying this just for that. Don't buy this, please; it's dangerous to have radios flying out of windows."
2,Same as all his other books,"I first read How To Get Your Competition Fired and loved it. I recently bought (and returned) The Wedge. It is almost an exact duplicate of How To Get Your Competition Fired. There are a few areas where he says things a bit differently but it's basically the same.I have a feeling The Wedge for Financial Advisors is the same as well. He has one good idea and seems to be rehasing it with different titles, but it's all the same concept. I'd say to get How To Get Your Competition Fired and the Red Hot Introductions book and you'd be set."
4,Great book,"Most reviews I read said that this is mainly for folks in the insurance business. After reading it, I understand where they are coming from since most of the examples pertain to that business. I would say that you could easily adapt the principles in the book to any consulting profession. The idea is to create doubt with a clients current situation and position yourself as a solution to their problem."
1,Horrible,I couldn't stand this book. I couldn't even make it through the first half without giving up and tossing the book aside. I absolutely loved Wicked and would put it on my list of favorite books so I can't understand how the same author came out with a book this bad.
4,Good read,If you enjoy a different take on classic fairy tails this is a good read. This is the third time I have read this book. Each time I do I pick up on a different plot twist. Of you enjoyed Maguire other books you will enjoy this one also.
2,well-written but sad,"This is just a very dark place to read, even though it is well written, as are all of Gregory Maguire's works."
3,got to love it,"This one is my favorite of the Gregory Maguire books. i found it interesting and yes, like his others, a little difficult to read but if you really like his work then you can read it fine."
1,Cindersmella,"This book is nowhere near the best I've ever read. Of course, I've read more than two books, the first one not being ""Wicked"" or ""See Spot Run"". An interesting premise that turned into ennui by the end of the first chapter. I like to give books a hundred pages, in the hope that it will get better, unfortunately, didn't happen this time. Don't be fooled by the number of pages either, the print is for a grade two level, frankly, so is the content. I wouldn't recommend it to my dog, and I hate my dog."
3,Wicked was better,"After practically soaking up ""Wicked"" through my very pores, I jumped to get ""Confessions"". I love the retellings of old fairy tales (Card's done a couple worth reading), but, sadly, I've tried to read ""Confessions"" twice now and I haven't been able to get through it yet. I'd like to know how it ends, but, I guess I don't want to know badly enough to actually read through the whole book.I don't normally need action. Relationship interplay, emotional interaction between involving characters is usually enough, but I was so bored trying to get through this. Iris is an interesting enough character, but I just kept waiting for something to happen. Neither Iris, nor her sister, mother, step-sister, potential love interest, etc, were interesting enough to keep me reading.Ah well, if you haven't read Maguire's works, skip this one and go to ""Wicked""."
4,Interesting and compelling,"I really enjoyed this book. I read Maguire's ""Wicked"" first and then this one. I thought this was a much easier read than Wicked was, and it really explained the story behind the story of Cinderella. I liked that it was unexpected and showed the characters for who they really are."
3,"Not as good as some others of this author's, but...","I read Wicked, found it a difficult read, but absolutely loved it. I read Son of a Witch thinking I would love it just as much. I was a little worried going into this book, thinking I would hate it, but I really enjoyed it! It wasn't so indepth that it got lost in itself. It didn't bog down badly. I wish the ending had been more fleshed out, but enjoyed the epilogue :-) A good book, well worth a read - it was interesting to see how the retelling of Cinderella worked out in Maguire's mind."
2,Dragging,I felt the whole story was dragging and slow paced. The concepts in the story are nothing new. The writing is mediocre.
5,Stepsister,I received the book very quickly and in perfect shape. I am in the midst of reading it now and find it very good.
4,a different twist,"This is a good book. I love Gregory Maguire, because he takes the well known fairytales and tells them from a different point of view of a character from that tale. This is one of the ""ugly"" stepsisters story of Cinderella. It was very good, for me it was a surprise to learn which sister is telling the story. Different events happened in this story than in the traditional story that would have made a big difference in the story that we all grew up on."
3,"Great twists, but the beginning is SO long!","Although I really got into this book from the middle to the end, the beginning was weak and yawn-worthy.This author should be noted, however, for his excellent descriptions and unforeseen plot twists."
3,"Not as good as Wicked, but still interesting.","Wicked was definitely the better book. The plot of Confessions dragged until about the last quarter, then everything gelled and the book turned out to be really great, but was not as consistently great as Wicked. Also the ending was a little bit too neat--all the loose ends carefully tied. So, I think it was worth the time, but if you're deciding between the two, go with Wicked."
5,Absolutely one of the best modern books that I've ever read,"I read this book in one night! It was absolutely mesmerizing. The story of Cinderella is one of the best-known in the world,yet somehow Maguire makes it a brand-new story. He has made every detail as beautiful as Clara and as deceptive as Ruth. For those who've read 'Wicked' this is proof that it was no fluke and for those who've never read Maguire before,well you're in for quite a treat. Read this book, but make sure that you can devote a whole day to it because you'll never wnat to put it down!"
4,FRANCE GALL FANS WILL ENJOY,This live album will please all FRANCE GALL fans including yours truely;there is also a second cd which is the continuation of this one.This was her comeback after her husbands's death( MICHEL BERGER)the year before.Her musicians provide good backing for her.DÉBRANCHE is longer and funkier than the original recording.The musicians don't steal the show;they give her the chance to display her considérable charm.Many songs like LA MINUTE DE SILENCE and MADEMOISELLE CHANG were originally recorded by MICHEL BERGER.Most fans of FRANCE GALL remain faithful to her;we remember the teenager who used to charm us and the happily married couple she formed with MICHEL.FRANCE will always be the GALL from FRANCE.
4,Good Look Back at the 1970s,"""The Sensational 70s"" is a retrospective on the Seventies consisting of ten episodes, one for each year of the decade--1970 through 1979. This DVD set covers many of the major domestic and international news stories that occurred during that era, and it also discusses some of the Seventies' fads and cultural trends such as bullet belts, cruising Van Nuys Boulevard, and punk rock. The series also looks at some more mundane stories that may not interest every viewer--included are news shorts on pigeon raising and New York City's problems with stray dogs.I saw a couple of these episodes on VH1 in the summer of 1991 and enjoyed them, and was glad to see the series available on DVD. Each episode appears in full, which means that it includes the memorable opening and closing theme music--that music is so cheesy that it's actually sort of cool (and is guaranteed to run through your mind for days after you hear it). The series is an enjoyable look back at the 1970s."
3,Not as advertised,"I bought this phone because it said ""dual handset."" The item came - it had one handset as pictured. I assumed that ""dual handset"" meant two handsets, whether they were pictured or not. I contacted Amazon who immediately sent me another of the same phone with one handset. I again contacted Amazon that their information was wrong. They said they would investigate but two months later the same description is on the website. I did try the phone, based on my good success with GE in the past. It was ok - the reception was good but not spectacular. The handset was a little clunky.If you want a phone with one handset this might be for you, but don't expect this to be really ""dual!"""
5,Every single girl should read this charming book,"Yes, this collection of short stories may seem a bit fragmented, but I couldn't put it down. An hour and a half later, I finished it. I then turned back to page one and began again. Lives are fragmented, and it was refreshing to read a book about -- what felt like, at least -- authentic experiences and feelings. In most people's search for that certain somebody, we put on our best selves, read all the self-help books we can, and cross our fingers our biggest annoyances will be beautifully disguised only to discover it it is silly to cover up who we truly are in order to find someone to genuinely love us . This book mixes strength, vulnerabilty, and humor to convey the unviersal experience of falling in and out of love.I read this book with a smile on my face throughout.Books don't have to be great literature to make us think and make us feel good. This book is on my favorites list, hands down."
1,Try again Ms. Banks,This book was over hyped not to mention way over rated. Someone compared the author to JD Salinger. Well that ought to send him in to further reclusion! This author need to get it together. She has the potential to be a good writer but she needs to find the right story and she needs to stick to that story and not wander off. I can't imagine what people found good about this story that includes a couple of chapters unrelated to the rest of the book. I will read her next book ( I like to give all authors at least a second chance)but if it is not any better it will be my last book by this author.
4,The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,"I thought it was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time. Although I'm no longer single, I could really identify with the stories about dating experiences and the challenge of trying to be yourself. The main character, Jane, was quick with the one-liners. I really enjoyed it! You just can't take it too literally."
3,A nice read with a disappointing ending,"I really enjoyed the book and related to the character (the chapters dedicated to the loss of her father were very involving), however, the end totally lost me. The characterization of the two women who had written the ""Guide to Finding and Marrying Mr. Right"" were downright annoying and uncalled for. Why did Bank choose to include them? It really brought the ending down. I found myself flipping past pages of dialogue with those two just to find out what *happened* to the lead character. Very disappointing."
2,Depressing and missing a lot of detail,"Ugh. That's exactly how I felt after reading this book, which comes across as more of a collection of short stories from parts of one woman's life. The stories are from different parts of this woman's life, but its hard to tell, because there's so many gaps in between the major events in her life, that I actually thought this was about more than one woman. The stories about her life are depressing tid bits, and make her sound like she's continually searching for something in her life, and it comes across as her being desperate. If you enjoy reading about women who are seemingly never happy, then pick this up, you would enjoy it. If you were hoping for a unique and interesting way of telling a life story, you're better off writing your own book."
2,What a Disappointment!,"Once again, I believed the hype surrounding a book and picked it up. I only paid a dollar and I want my money back. I am an English major and I read a lot of great old books, but there is lots of great contemporary fiction out there--this just isn't it. If you really want to read this book,I would recommend that you check it out from the library. It's not worth plunking down money for."
2,might have as well been about hunting and fishing,"It was mediocre at best, every review i read explained that it was an amazing insight into being single and what its like. I didn't connect with this at all and regret the purchase"
2,Very East Coast,"Perhaps you have to be from the east coast of the USA to appreciate this book. It seemed smug, stilted, and tried too hard to be clever. I found myself wondering how the book was ever published, but I suspect that ties to someone in publishing did the trick. I admit that the title story was the best part. It had better movement and less of a self-pitying tone than the rest of the stories. The good part is that it's a popular book and if I take it to Powell's quickly I'll get an extra buck trade-in."
3,A nice light read for beach or airplane ride...,"I bought this book used, in paperback, and as such was not disappointed. It's not ""literature"", it's not Austen, for goodness sakes, but it was entertaining as I sat by the pool and watched my kids splash during Spring Break.The book is a collection of short stories, thrown together to arc throught the life of one ""Jane"", a frustrated preppie who tries for years to get her life together, (especially her love life) and finally succeeds at the end of the book. Saved by the bell, she meets, and despite her best efforts to sabotage herself, wins her dream man, and they live happily ever after.This book was nowhere near what I'd consider deep. It had some nice moments, some good dialogue, some clever imagery. Sometimes I wanted to give Jane a little shake, and tell her ""get over it!"" and get on with it, but all in all it was a worthwhile read. Buy it in paperback to read at the beach this summer."
5,A truly wonderful book of short stories,"This was a fabulous book, but I have a tiff with the author. Since you wrote and had such a fantastic book published, now all the publishers seem to be publishing anything about single women in their thirties. Beware readers! Don't bother with Bridget Jone's Diary, and especially avoid The Perfect Elizabeth. There are two examples that are just awful. Melissa Bank, please keep writing and please keep showing these other wanna-be authors how it's done!"

1,Nowhere near as good as the 2 Bridget Jones .....,"........... or Laura Zigman's' books. By the time I got to the 2nd chapter, it was clear that it was a waste of time. Being a fan of Helen Fielding, I read as many books on more or less the same subject, even if it means ordering over the net and paying that exhorbitant delivery charges. To add salt to the wound, this book was ""electronically recomended"" based on my Wish List. Give this one a skip, yah. Not even for summer reading!"
1,"so lame, I threw it across the room","I was anxious to read this because I read one of her stories in Redbook magazine. They advertised it as an exceprt from the book, however, that particular story appeared nowhere in the book. This was the first problem. The second problem was the book itself, which was not a novel, but a bunch of short stories. I was completely unaware of this until I got all the way to the ANNOYING MIDDLE CHAPTER, featuring a completely different protagonist. Finally, it dawns on me. So THAT""S the reason she keeps switching tenses! So THAT's the reason she keeps jumping around! So THAT""S the reason I hate this book so much I'm throwing it across the room! I think it was a lame effort to publish an unfinished novel in a hurry. She probably sent the first chap out and got a nibble, then ran out of time and since she couldn't get the chaps to gel, she called them short stories instead. Glad I didn't buy it at Borders."
1,Yawn fest,Poor old Jane couldnt too excited about everything that was going on around her so there was no way I was going to! The 'precious' little stories that appeared from nowhere at different parts of the book stifled the narrative and distracted from the story of Jane's romantic entanglements. Simply put-not satisfying or engaging at any point. See Marian Keyes if you want to read something of this ilk that doesnt leave you cold. I found myself not the slightest bit concerned how any of the characters lives panned out and then wanted to 'barf' when Mr Too Good to be True strode in through all that predictable doom and gloom!
2,A TIME KILLER WHILE ON VACATION,"I bought this book while on vacation. I was looking for something light and fluffy and entertaining - nothing deep. The review on the jacket led me to believe something different about the content. I was disappointed in the overall story, but I did read the entire book. I couldn't get ""into"" Jane's character. I was pretty much glad when I'd finished reading the book."
5,the best best friend book of all time,"From the moment I picked up this book, I knew I loved it. Jane became my best friend and mentor through love. This book is perfect for the beach or a rainy day...anything. Melissa Bank is a promising new author and I can't wait for her next book."
3,Disappointing but not entirely,"I expected a lot from this book given the reviews. It was definitely a quick, enjoyable read but I found myself wanted more character development.Who was Jane Rosenal? What made her tick? There were brief hints and clues but nothing substantive."
2,Disappointing,"After seeing this book prominantly displayed in my local bookstore time after time, I finally bought it. I was excited at first, but my excitement quickly faded as I muddled my way through the book. I kept hoping that the book would get better, but it didn't. I agree with another reviewer that there isn't enough character development here, even with Jane. She comes off very shallow, and she's not someone I would really care to know.Another mysterious section is one of the stories in the middle of the book. The narrator is Nina, not Jane, and it doesn't really fit anywhere in the book, except she is the downstars neighbor of Jane's much older boyfriend. I kept waiting for any of the characters in that section to reappear, but they never do. Something funny does happen in that section, but you never know what the resolution is.The best part of the book is the last section where she tries to live by the oft-mocked Rules. I wish more of the book was like the last section!"
2,"low self esteem, no plot","I was excited about reading this book after all the buzz that had surrounded it. While reading it, I kept waiting for it to get good. It is a collection of short pieces most of which focus on a central character as she matures through adolescence and toward middle age. I kept thinking that she would blossom and become someone I admired. It never happened. I read for escape or for inspiration. I dont have time to read about boring characters who have no self esteem and consistently sell themselves short. Read something else instead."
3,An uneven collection,"The first two stories start a trajectory of one woman's journey on the confusing path of the search for love. Unfortunately, this cohesiveness and consistency of quality then vanishes, reappearing in the final story, which is easily the best of the lot. In the middle, there is an awkward story of a family unrelated to the main character except for their address, a confusing breast cancer 2nd person tale (which would have been excellent as a stand alone, but the reader is distracted from the merits of the story with questions of how it relates to the rest of the book), and an altogether too long exploration of the heroine's relationship with an older man. As individual stories, all of this book is good, but as a collection, really only the first 2 and last one hold up."
4,a fun read,"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing is a very enjoyable read. We journey with Jane Rosenal through her childhood, family dynamics, career choices and intimate relationships on her quest for self-discovery. Jane feels like a failure in the love arena so naturally, she attempts to immerse herself in a self-help book formula for success. Unfortunately, this self-help book attempts to tame Jane's greatest assets, her keen observations and wicked sense of humor. This is a truly funny read with a very real and relatable character in Jane"
2,Pathetic heroine,"Look, the writing wasn't bad. The story was told in an interesting way--rather than as a standard novel, we learn about Jane through a series of stories about Jane that are hardly connected. But you know what? My favorite story was the one that had the least to do with Jane. And you know why? Because I didn't like Jane. She thinks humor is all that she has when she's not all that funny. She's insecure. She leads men on but then acts like the victim. She's not passionate about anything. I didn't want her to succeed because I didn't feel like she deserved to succeed. I can't get into a novel with such a pathetic heroine.This is what started the ""chick lit"" genre? Well, that makes sense."
2,Not sure what I expected,"I'd heard of this novel in the context of better known chicklit novels and picked it up in a hotel. I read through the first chapter without a whole lot of enthusiasm as there did not seem to be a lot of plot. The style was precocious, which I put down to the fact that it was supposed to be written by a fourteen-year old. I read the second chapter (Jane is now in her 20s) with a bit more interest, but felt like I was missing something. The style has veneer (some other reviewer used that word) but little substance--or else, like I said, I'm missing something. Don't know if I'll persevere. I came here to check out the reviews and get some insight."
1,Not What I Expected,I had heard so many good things about this book and couldn't wait to read it. I read it and I was greatly dissapointed. Jane was very dull in all of the stories and towards the end I just lost interest in the book. I finished it and wasn't impressed!
1,Snappy wit only goes so far,"Sure, there is some clever dialogue in The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, but I found it to be a boring, overwrought meditation on the lives of rich New Yorkers with nothing else to do but reflect on love lost and vacations in Martha's Vineyard. I like my chick lit with slightly rougher edges."
4,absolutely loved this book!!,"Loved Jane, I laughed and empathized with her the whole book through. My one complaint was lack of continuity and specifics, it was a little hard to connect with her cause you couldn't ever tell what age she was at during the experiences, and, the two short stories were so ambiguous it took a while to realize thery weren't about Jane. I wish that they had been longer though, the majority of this book was so well written but too brief. Read this book!!!!!!"
4,"Fabulous summer reading, clever, witty writing","Jane brought back memories of my single life.I laughed and cried with her.This book was fast, and enjoyable."
2,Not quite what I expected,"This book was a very fast read. I really enjoyed the first chapter and getting to know Jane at 14. But, like others, I was left wondering, ""Who the heck is Barney?"" Jane had potential, but never quite made it."
2,"Add mine to all the voices saying ""Huh?""","Ahh, the benefits of a great publicist! Must have been that because this book certainly falls way far from the mark. The ""Rules"" chapter was fun - but other than that (which reads like a magazine article) the rest of the book was a bowl of stale microwave popcorn, a flat Diet Coke, and a rerun of Ally McBeal. Disappointed!"
3,Cute book,"I read this book on a whim while flying across the country. At first I wasn't sure I would like it but it did quickly become very entertaining. I really like the progression of her life and seeing her change from a young girl to a young woman, trying to find the right relationship, stuggle with her parents, find meaning at work...all things we can relate to. I really wound up liking this book a lot. It was a quick read and I couldn't put it down until I was done. Thats always a good sign to me!"
3,don't believe the hype,"There's talent here, but the book's been misrepresented as 'smart and funny.' Unfortunately, Jane ain't so smart and her life is far from funny--dysfunctional romance with much older dysfunctional (in more ways than one!) man; low self-esteem and a curious forgiveness for men behaving very badly throughout."
2,Incredibly disappointing.......a bridget jones wannabeee,"This just didn't live up to the glowing reviews on the cover. It is a collection of somewhat connected short stories that are a little too clever, just try a little too hard, so that one notices the writing, but is left wondering where the story is. Two of the stories are unrelated and don't really seem to belong....one of them is written in the second person for some unknown reason and all I can say is that Jay McInerney did it so much better in Bright Lights Big City. Overall, the book was a disappointment and I will not recommend it.....there are many other up and coming authors who are much more deserving....or just have something worth saying......this book just glosses over material that has already been well covered by other writers....and offers nothing new........"
3,"I liked it, although I wasn't blown away.","This was a thoroughly average book for me. I read it about a year ago, and cannot remember one stand-out thing about it except that it was about a woman who was attracted to a much older man (that in my mind at the time I pictured looking like Jack Nicholson)."
2,disappointing,"I was looking for a fun, easy-going book when I came across The Guide. It took me less than 3 days to get through, and I was partially confused the entire time. I never found the ""fun, sexy"" main character that was advertised on the book jacket. What I did find was random stories that never gained enough depth to give insight into the art of ""hunting and fishing."" Actually the only time these terms were brought up was in the last few pages of the book. The rest of the book just told parts of Jane's life and two random chapters of other people's life. I found never found any guidance for life, dating, or love... Each chapter started with me guessing who's head I was in and who they were, how old they were, anything. Most were about Jane, but it could of been a new person each time - I never saw connections from chapter to chapter. I will comend Melissa Banks for making it very easy to read and in the end showing hope for love."
1,WHAT THE HECK WAS THIS?,"I cannot understand how so many people gave this book five stars. Unbelievable! It started out promisingly enough, then by the end I was just trying to finish it so I could throw the book in the trash (maybe I'll donate it to the library). There was no cohesiveness whatsoever, and the way it jumped from 1st to second to third person was just confusing. I liked the cover though, that's where the one star came from. Otherwise, lame!"
1,Excellent first chapter looking for a novel,"""Advanced Beginners"" is good as a stand-alone short story but the rest of the book gets tedious as it wears on. The last chapter is just silly."
2,Definitely Not Bridget Jones,"When I first picked up this book, the first thing I thought of was Bridget Jones, one of my favorites. I got through this book in about 2 days and was left thinking ""huh?"" I guess I expected much more. I enjoyed the stories, but not as much as I had hoped. So my advice: if you loved Bridget Jones and are looking for something similar, you won't find it in Jane Rosenal."
2,"Mildly entertaining, not about fishing and hunting :(",This book was forgetable! I like to fish and hunt and bought it on a whim but was thoroughly disappointed with the pathetic nature of the main character. There's way more to life than fishing and hunting for men! It's almost as bad a Briget Jones diary!
5,Wow!,"For so long I was fooled by the glossy veneer put up by overrated music genres such as classical and jazz music to cover their lack of real musical content and inspiration, but after listening to a Wesley Willis CD I have seen the error of my ways! This CD is not only a masterwork of epic proportions, but also a spiritual journey that will lead its listeners to the bright light of the musical promised land! I own all the Wesley Willis CDs. In fact, I play them at night while I sleep, hoping that some of his genius might be passed subconsciously into my pathetic mind, tragically devoid Willis's white-hot ball of pure creativity that continuously burns my soul and lights my fire. Needless to say, I highly recommend this CD to everyone out there in search of a true genius."
1,Waste of time,"It's totally a waste of time on this book. It's just a bible without the word ""God"". That's it."
2,Finally got around to reading this,"A lot of water over the dam by now. I will just say as a mathematician and a deist, I am unimpressed. There's no humility. The ""theistic evolutionists"" Dembski condemns (not in this book, that came later) are impressive because they communicate a sense of honesty you just do not ever get from Dembski. He reminds me strongly of statistics obfuscator Bjorn Lomborg and also, frankly, of the radical sociobiologist Steven Pinker - unconcerned with science, in it for the polemics.This is a polemic. It's neither science nor theology. It's a pamphlet for the culture wars. I would write a longer review but Scott Ryan above hit every single note I would have and more, so it'd be redundant.Two, not one, stars, though, because it's not the worst thing this mendacious hack has written, by a long shot. It has sections of merit."
5,Everything in one neat and complete package,"I am amazed at the amount of information in this book. Everything you could possibly need to know to find a job in federal law enforcement is presented in a logical and organized format. You could spend months or even years of research to locate the agencies and information about them, but this book puts it all together in one package that is current and reliable. The information in this book will make anyone more knowledgable and competitive."
2,Not worth the money!,"It really bugs me when I read so much hype about a set of knives that are supposed to be ""as good as"" another set. Of course, the other set was twice the price, but given that I have this set for just over a month, I'm not that big a cook, and they're already dull, should give you an idea that they're not nearly as good as even the cheapo set I have. This was money thrown in the trash, so I hope others realize that the answer is, either buy the best, or buy the cheapo set so you're not disappointed, like I am."
1,Missing Knives...again.,"I ordered this exact set of knives only to find 2 knives missing from the package. Amazon quickly sent me another set of knives. This time, the scissors were missing, as well as one other knife. Really Amazon? Really?"
5,"Ted Gunderson Report talks about ""The Franklin Cover-Up""","I believe that there are secret societies in our government.It has been going on for thousands of years throughout history, why is it so inconceivable that it's not going on now?Please do a search on google for the Ted Gunderson Report, it is hard to believe."
4,Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion was a good product. ...,"Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion was a good product. It worked really well on my insect bites. It also did a good job of drying up poison ivy, but it didn't take the itch away. I'd use this product again."
5,Excellent product,The author has spent some time and effort researching and developing this book and information included. It is an excellent and descriptive book on an incredible event in U.S. and Japanese as well as world history! A definite must for WWII history and divers interested in visiting Chuuk (Truk)
4,Love It,I love this fountain. Its easy to put together. I didn't have any problems with it. It looks wonderful and have gotten many compliments. The only complaint I have is that I have to add water to it every day and sometimes a couple of times a day because it all splashes out and evaporates. You can't let the water level get below the pump line or it could burn out the pump so you have to keep it filled. My husband is going to plumb water to it eventually so I don't have to keep filling it up everyday. Other than that I love it.
5,Self-evidently quality,"Other than the finish (which cries out to be enameled candy-apple red), this is a perfect camp mug, or little pot. It'll cook up a pack and a half of ramen, is about the size, and feels stout as anything. Haven't tried to run it over, but have cooked in it (over the little Triad stove, for which it is a perfect match). It cleans easily, and leaves no trace of the reheating, or the cream of mushroom soup I burned to the bottom of it. It's a mug, it's a pot, it does both things well. The handles are a little skinny, especially if you fill the mug with coffee and have only a semi-firm handshake, but I mention this only for folks who plan on using this every day and have soft little hands."
1,Very little use to anyone actually intersted in converting their lawn.,"This is a great big book full of interesting ideas but very little of it has to do with converting your lawn into useful garden space. I am all for spreading the word on community and the green movement in general but I was looking for a how to book on gardening not on how to think. Obviously, if you purchase this book you already lean towards that bent and will find nothing useful here. There are other books that have a lot more meat to them without getting preachy. If you have to read this one get if from the library."
1,lightweight,definitely not a how to book. there are no pictures - i would have liked to see pictures of her garden....
3,"NOT non-greasy, although it works fairly well","This lotion is not just a moisturizer; it also contains dimethicone. Dimethicone is a kind of silicone oil. When I use even a small amount of this product, it leaves my hands feeling vaguely slippery for several hours.This is intentional: the dimethicone oil forms a layer on the skin that protects it against drying out. The lotion seems to work pretty well for this purpose. My hands had been suffering rather badly in the recent cold, dry weather, and using this lotion has helped them considerably. I do not care for the persistent slight greasy feel, however, so I will not be buying any more after my current tube is used up."
4,Well executed metal,"My first purchase of a band I knew little of other than the title track, what a great surprise. Not a shredfest, it IS alot of melodic lead guitar work with some excellent short ripping leads, this would have been huge in the 80's heyday. This is NOT glossy glam shallow metal, it's really good songwriting with excellent musicianship all around. The singer, Urban Breed, has a great deal of variety in his voice that adds the right elements to each song.Some of the best songs are Sword of Retribution, Matters of the Dark, I Know Your Name, & Riding the Beast. This would be very solid pickup for anyone interested in great musicianship."
3,ok I guess,Well I at least expected new scissors but the one I got looks like it has been used a lot and looks dirty. How ever I kept it anyways just because it will be for school for my son and they have to share things with the whole class.
3,For right-handed kids ONLY,"Unfortunately this item comes up in your search for 'left handed scissors' as the manufacturer have described it as being comfortable for both right and left handed kids. One of the way you can identify left handed scissors is to look at the side the top blade's handle points when the scissors are kept vertical with the handles towards your side. If the top blade's handle is to your left, then they are comfortable for left handed kids.The reason why they are more comfortable for left handed kids has to do with how they can see the blade's edge while cutting. Having said that, it'd be better for left handed kids to learn to use both right and left handed scissors as they may not have access to left handed scissors everywhere! Overall a good product but wrongly categorized and described."
5,treo,Everything arrived on time and worked as advertised. I am well pleased with the products and pricing.
1,Paperback at $100?,"This review has nothing to do with the content of the book. It is the reprint of the 1987 classic on measurement error model, only NOW as PAPERBACK, and Wiley has guts to price it over $100."
1,TOO SCARY FOR CHILDREN,"My 3-year old son was so scared when he watched this video that I had to turn it off. He normally loves Scooby Doo, but when the zombies attacked AND FRED YANKED THE HEAD OFF A ZOMBIE, it was way too scary for him. This is not in the true tradition of Scooby Doo. Scooby and the gang unmasks villians and thieves, etc., but this and the other one, Witch's Ghost, did not depict people dressed up as bad guys, but true supernatural occurances. A friend's daughter also watched this and was scared."
1,too scary for smaller kids,"My kids were watching this movie and I had to fast forward through it....wish I had read the reviews before letting them see it....they are too freaked out by the werewolf creatures and zombies to enjoy this movie. No comedic value whatsoever. This is a scooby movie for parents and maybe eight or nine year olds, NOT kindergarteners. Forget this movie, get the collections of the old episodes instead"
4,Still love the old ones best.,I still love the old Scooby-Doo's the best but this is not half bad. My 3 y.o. loves Scooby-Doo and has really enjoyed this one. Especially since I bought it for him.
1,"Not the original Scooby-Doo, Where are You?","This is the worst Scooby-Doo movie that I have ever watched. The original ""Scooby-Doo, Where are You?"" series was based upon Scooby and his friends finding a logical explanation as to why there were mysterious situations occurring. This new movie drastically departs from this, and is very dissapointing. The plot revolves only around real ghosts, monsters, witchcraft and the supernatural. I can't believe that parents find this an appropriate movie for young children. I wish I could give this movie a zero."
4,Sweet Easter Songs!,"Sweet Easter Songs. They are so fun for kids. Along with this album, I would recommend 'Easter Songs to Christmas Melodies' by 'Nooshi the Balloon Dude' along with a great Easter album by 'Veggietales', also available for download on Amazon. Kids will be hoppin to these Bunnyland Easter songs!"
5,Sexy !!!,"I learned of Sin Bandera when I visited Monterrey this summer. At a 'jumping' bar/restaurant, they played ""Sirena"" over the loudspeaker. It was absolutely wonderful. I immediately bought the CD hoping that it would meet my expectations and IT DID. These guys are terrific and their voices are to die for. Sexiness drips from their vocal chords. I am eager to hear (and buy) their next work. This CD inspires the full range of emotions from romance to sheer fun."
5,"Blue Ridge Mountain Music ""Old Time Banjo""","When you play this CD on your system close your eyes and let the music take you to the Applachian Mountains of 80 years ago. The selections are authentic,varied, fresh, and played expertly in the old time style. Mr.Howell does a excellent job preserving the time old traditions of mountain music. I recommend this CD for all lovers of banjo and mountain music."
1,Broke on first use! :-(,"I received these as a gift from my boys for Christmas and was able to use them for the time when I went to the Broncos vs Ravens playoff game. When I got to the stadium parking lot, 1 of the 2 flags had broken off somewhere along the 25 mile drive. Now I'm debating whether to even use the other flag at all next year."
1,Scooter arrived (twice) scratched up,"I will follow up with a full report on the 300 after Christmas, but wanted to warn those considering this for a Christmas present. Order early!I ordered 1 a few weeks ago. The box arrived in rough shape and a large hole were the base of the scooter (the widest part) was exposed. The paint was all scratched up and looked bad. I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out another one, but it arrived with the exact same problem. It appears the manufacturer's packaging is inadequate."
4,razor e300 review,"The razor is great. I use it everyday at work. no problems as of yet. thought it would go faster, i might be a bit heavy (170). weight of rider plays a big factor in top speed."
4,great scooter!,"Bought this scooter for my 11 year old, he loves it!! My 8 year old has the red E100 that also is a great scooter but this beats it! not only the speed but the tires are larger and more robust, with the free shipping on this scooter, it is a great deal!"
2,rear wheel assembly problem,"We bought two e300 razors for the grandkids. One performs as advertised and the other is slow and labored. We made the effort to adjust the chain tension and discovered that the rear wheel assembly was faulty. The chain sprocket was not concentric with the wheel/tire so the chain was slack-tight-slack-tight...... Manufacturer has been contacted and indicated that they will send new assembly. If they do and if it is correct and the performance is the same as the other unit, we will be pleased with the product as the grandkids love them. If the follow up from Razor is not as they suggest, or if the new part is not correct, we will be very dissapointed. 50% satisfaction is about like 0% satisfaction, just ask the grandkid that can't keep up because of poor performance."
2,Disappointed,Arrived with piece missing! Getting it from razor was difficult. They mailed to wrong address and I had a very disappointed grandson who could not use his brand new scooter. Will never buy another product from them! Still waiting after over 2 weeks.
3,battery wasn't good at first,"This scooter needs adjustment, particularly to the chain before you use it. It works, out of the box, but the battery life is significantly improved by making adjustments recommended both on the Razor website and the other reviews written here. hang in there, and you'll end up with a fun scooter."
4,Good fun scooter,"Bought it for the kids and they have enjoyed it tremendously.We've owned it for almost a month now and they play with it regularly.The only thing we find somewhat disappointing is the battery life and time to charge. Typically the battery does not last for more then 40-45 minutes with the kids taking turns on it.Recharging it takes several hours.Assuming the battery life aspect is pretty much standard in the industry, I would recommend this scooter."
3,Box ripped & Item Scratched,"The product was shipped quickly and arrived to my door very fast. I was disgusted to see the box was ripped and part of the exposed scooter was sticking out of the box. It was all scratched up. It was packaged so poorly. There was no protection around it in the box. It was a gift. I decided to give it with the scratches on it instead of returning it to Amazon.com because the return policy was very vague and I could not tell if I could return it without paying for the return shipping. I guess next time, I will buy at a store."
4,"Have Fun, Be Safe","We purchased two of these scooters for our two oldest grandson's for Christmas, 8 and 6 years old. Both of them wear helmets and have fun riding them; they must be supervised while riding them however. Because of the speed that these scooters can reach we try to instill in the boys each time they ride them to use safety and caution. So far only a couple of spills and no injuries thank goodness. Fun for the kids."
5,"Great quality, great product!","This item is exactly what it promises to be; a sturdy, well-made scooter with the added benefit of an extra-wide deck for stability. Controls are easy to use and the charge lasts for a long time. Great product!"
4,NY Knicks Cooler,"I think this cooler was very well made. Would probably have liked another outside pocket, but it suited my needs. The zipper on top is sturdy too. I am happy with this purchase."
2,In spite of a sloppy script.........,"VIN did his VERY best and showed enough range to get across how he was feeling at crucial points in the movie(ex.when his wife was killed,etc.)Larenz Tate and the rest of the supporting cast was also very good.Its too bad this movie was obviuosly written in great haste and didnt pay attention to clarity.For those who were totally disappointed ,please dont judge Vin Diesel's acting by this film alone!"
3,"This movie is cool, but not THAT cool","This movie is okay. Vin Diesel is a cop with a reason for vengeance when gang members kill his wife. His friend doesn't want to help him, because he has a family, and doesn't want them to get involved. So, for part of the movie at least, Vin Diesel is literally a man apart, who has to take on this gang alone.Lots of action and fighting, cool special effects, and a good story. It's not all that original, though, and that's why it gets only three stars."
3,quite good actually,"I must say i was impressed by this movie,Vin Diesel can actually act.Unlike xXx which i hated with a passion,this movie shows a more emotional side of Diesel,something we definately are not use to seeing.He actually cry's,get's nervous,get's hurt,everything a real human would do,unlike xXx were he goes through flame's,jumps motorcycles through the air like spiderman,never gets hit once,not one drop of blood etc.So watch this and you actually won't think it's lame,like most action star's with one liner's.He actually does more:)"

1,INFERIOR PAUL ANKA,"CD does not use the original recording of ""diana"". didn't even botherlistening to the remaining 19 tracks as i don't want a re-recordedbest of CD. caveat emptor."
4,MUST LISTEN,A 'must' for any Francophile or anyone who likes French comtemporary music. 'Les Tyrans' is somewhat controversial and typical of Veronique's gift for interesting music and lyrics. 'Je me suis tellement manquee' and of course 'Indestructible' are also part of the songs that make this album so unique and fantastic. You can't be disappointed.
3,Too slow moving,"this video does have some excellent strength moves but i must agree that if you enjoy the flow of vinyasa, as i do, this tape got too boring. i have given it 3 stars simply because ry's yoga ""ballet"" in the beginning of the tape was wonderful & inspiring to watch."
2,Lame.,"If you're into power yoga - that is, challenging flow and poses, this will dissapoint. I have Baron Baptiste and Brian Kest tapes and wanted a change. This was a snoozer."
2,oh well,I purchased this on price and I have other Rodney Yee DVD's. This one I do not like. The verbal descriptions are off. He forgets to cue you through transition points. I will put this on the shelf for a while and revisit it in a few months... maybe it will appeal in time. I would not reccomend this.
3,Yoga isn't supposed to be a contest,"Rodney, slow down! The 3rd section moves so quickly it's like watching very flexible and beautiful yogis put on an exhibition. If you enjoy leaping from pose to pose, never spending more than 2 or 3 seconds on each one, then this tape is for you. Up dog. Down dog. Jump to plank. Jump to forward bend and so on. As long as it took you to read those words is as long as you will spend in each pose. If you are extremely flexible and experienced with yoga you will probably enjoy this tape. I use this tape for a change now and then, and when I go thru the way too fast paced 3rd section I just do my own thing at my own pace. Normally I practice with Ali McGraw's Yoga Mind and Body. I gave this tape 3 stars because it is beautifully done, and I like the other 4 sections which do not move so quickly. I agree with another viewer that the warm up section is not long enough."
2,"if you like gongs & windchimes, this is your tape!","Am I the only one who hates this same music in all Rodney Yee tapes? Not only is this the music used in AM & PM Yoga, it has also been used in Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing AND Back Care Yoga, as well. Since I'm tired of it, from my other 4 yoga videos, I did not give the tape more stars. I enjoy the first & second segment, however, the first segment is VERY similar to AM Yoga, and the 2nd segment is very close to Yoga Remedies' stress segment. I won't be buying any more tapes from the Living Arts & Yoga Journal series because I'm tired of the gongs & windchimes, and similar footage."
3,Good basic information,"This book provides a clear and detailed understanding of the technical side of copper red glazes. I did find it in some places to be ""heavy"" reading and the lack of good quality colour photographs was disappointing."
5,benissimo!,"Luca knows the elements that go into a fine pop tune and this is one album that is perfect for just switching on and having a listen no matter where you are and how you are feeling. I was very impressed by his performance at the San Remo Music Festival in which he sang Spariro (it is available on Youtube), it was heartfelt and he sang it note for note. Excellent musician who is a joy to watch on stage. This guy's on an incline and it will be very interesting to watch him blossom. Italy is proud to have you on the world stage Luca :)"
4,Serves its purpose!,I wish this cutting board were a little thicker/sturdier...but it does look like Texas and that's the real reason I bought it. :)
1,Won't buy again,My cat will not take or eat this pill . To big and smells terrible. Will not buy again. Thank You
2,cabinet organizer,constructed of heavy materials however craftsmanship less than expected. corners were not welded at right-angles!
4,A good book but it has some shortcommings,"If your going strictly by the TV or novel storyline, you will love this book, even though it is missing some mecha (like Lancer's crashed veritech). The RPG story that Siembieda made up completely contradicts the ending of the TV show.As a GM, I have found the best way to play this book is either changing the story so that the players replace Scott Bernard's group, or else plating it in another part of the world than North and South America. Even with the questionable exisence of the Vindicator, the book is very good overall"
2,increase the stock,"I want you to buy 4 wheels only have 2 available, increase the amount to make the purchase"
4,A great workout if a little bit fast,"The Intermediate Yoga DVD is a great step up from the beginner yoga workout, although I wouldn't recommend anyone try the shoulder and headstands without working with a certified instructor to prevent injury. I was sore for days but already notice a difference in my flexibility and core strength."
3,"great, but missing some things","This is a nice starter DVD at this level, but I wish it incorporated the inversions into the flow. Rodney Yee is (in my opinion) one of the best Yoga via DVD instructors. I highly recommend any of his DVD's for those who want to practice at home. He is extremely technical, but calm, and soothing. If you want to to real yoga (not hot)and build some actual strength to enhance your flexibility, Rodney is a great starting point. In addition, as an advanced yoga student, I pop in some of his lower level DVDs. They still give a great workout and he gives wonderful reminders of the basics of alignment. If only Rodney and Jason Crandell came out with a workout together. That would be heaven. ps...the advanced DVD set is GREAT!"
5,Fine tool,I don't know how Johnson can sell this level for such a low price. It's well made and the magnet is a blessing when leveling or squaring shop tools.
5,Good Thing,"This is a great little item, easy to read, unbreakable, short and lightweight enough to be manageable on small jobs. I'm happy."
5,great product for the price,"Order was shipped and received timely, arrived is excellent condition. i bought this item for my son who is just getting into skateboarding, all the other cheap skateboards have broken rather promptly but this board holds up to a lot of grinding, jumps and other skate park riding. I would recommend this item. it is definately worth the price."
1,after order placed/ was informed you were out of stock,After I ordered this item and was charged/ I e-mailed for tracking/ was informed you wewe out of item/ charge refunded/had to find item elsewhere
5,"A book to change your life, for times of trouble...","I was in deep trouble, and going thru a low point in my life, and this book, made me look at life differently. It showed me what I was doing wrong, showed mw how to apply the living Word of God to my life, and how to live God's Word, not just hear it, read it, say it, do it, but live it. Words are powerful, and this book will get you back into reading your Bible daily, and speaking words of faith, and praying in Jesus' name, and listening to God, and doing and getting in His will. And it will get you into praying in the Holy Ghost(tongues). Also get Hagin;s mini book ""Why Tongues?"""
5,The Best Showcase So Far for XBOX Live!,"Rainbow Six 3 (what a lousy title!) really shows the potential of Microsoft's XBOX Live. A tactical shooter, RS3 provides a deep, addictive, and fun online experience that makes it the HALO of Live games.Tactical shooters seem to be a perfect fit for Live, in part because the headset communication flows naturally from the genre. (Those guys REALLY DO talk on little headsets, don't they?) The overall effect of the game is transparent and immersive--you really feel like you are on location with your small team of compadres. Adding to the feel of reality is how much the game makes you behave as if your life were at stake, you quickly learn that you are not superman; getting shot really does a lot of damage! (Who knew?)The connectivity is great; I have yet to encounter a laggy or choppy game. The game really is well done and just plain fun!"
1,Doesn't play on 360,I thought that this game would play on my XBOX 360 but to my surprise it did not. Being so happy to buy and play this game that I didn't look for the 360. My mistake but what I see this game and what you can do. I would have scored this game very high.
5,Very challenging and addictive,"I find the game very challenging. You can only save twice within levels and if you shut the power off, you lose the within mission saves and must start the mission again. This leads the game to have an addictive quality as you try to complete a mission before having to shut the XBox off. Great game."
2,This games has glitches!,"After reaching the Import/Export level in this games expect to start getting restarts in this and all future levels. Check out any of the forums devoted to this game and you will see that this is a common problem. Some people relate it to using the night/thermal vision and advocate not using it. Sorry, that's not acceptable. UbiSoft coming out with some kind of fix would be acceptable but as I've already become frustrated enough, it will be too late for me. I'm going to trade RS6 3 in tomorrow for Max Payne 2."
3,Not hypoallergenic--results can widely vary,"It's made of oat flour--and isn't good for celiac/gluten sensitive people. I used it for a while and worked great for me, but I started dating someone gluten sensitive and her skin started to break out, and she got a rash in certain areas. I stopped using this product, and her symptoms resolved.The term 'hypo allergenic' is misleading on this product. Gluten sensitivity is not an uncommon problem, and the basic ingredient of this bar contains a bunch of it. It would make as much sense to call peanut butter hypoallergenic."
3,Oldie but still good,Very much enjoyed this old MacLaine comedy and the appearance of the famous actors playing her numerous husbands. Good fun!
4,Great Buy,Great condition and came super fast. Sometimes when buying used DVDs it can be a worry but this was a smooth transaction
2,A troubled little cherub finally finds happiness.,"Although an adorable little angel, he is very worldly. He rides an emotional roller coaster of emotions and creates displeasure among other angels. He is finally content when he has a trinket box retrieved from his past mortal life. When the angels are gathering gifts for the Christ Child, he is terrified over God's possible wrath, should he not approve of his insignificant gift. It is chosen to become the Star of Bethlehem. I question the amount of negativity and his fear so great that he ""rolls himself into a ball of consummate misery,"" in the presence of God.I feel that it depicts heaven in a 'worrisome' manner for impressionable young readers. His initial behavior is troublesome. The illustrations are great, and is a strong point for the book."
1,Unbelievably boring,"This book is very clear, but it is quite boring. I have to read it for an astronomy class and the hundred dollars I spent on it has been wasted. All the concepts are very clearly explained through pictures, examples from real life and diagrams, but this textbook still sucks nonetheless. IF you know that you have to purchase this textbook for a class, pray the class isnt as dull as the reading"
5,Terrific!,"New to yoga, I purchased this for my husband as a gift. We both enjoy it immensely. It offers education of technique and is easy to follow. We always feel rejuvenated and peaceful upon completion of a session with Rodney. I highly recommend for practiced beginners."
4,Historical,"Reminds me of a cheap 70's cartoon, however I know Mike had a limited budget,so don't expect Toy Story graphics. I purchased it more for the historical knowledge,which I say is spot on and fantastic.GOOD JOB MIKE CHURCH!!!"
4,Great history lesson!,"I had my wife order this for Father's Day after listening to Mike Church's show advertising it for months. I wasn't disappointed. This movie (which I watched with me entire extended family as a history lesson) reminded me how much I need to revisit the TRUE history of our country. I really enjoyed the story, knowing it was based on factual documents. I took away one star from my review for the animation. I've seen many reviews commenting on the ""stunning"" animation, but I found it to be anything but stunning (in a good way). We live in a Pixar world, and if we try to use videos like this to reach the modern generation of kids, they will laugh in our faces. Mr. Church, I know this is a budget issue (hopefully so many purchases of RTI will help!), and so I'm hoping that one day you will revisit this work and make it live action or better animation. Also, could someone please explain the butt-goosing scene? Overall, I loved the history lesson! Thanks, Mike Church!"
2,fork in the road,"I happened to pick this book up with a gift certificate after reading the inside jacket. I never heard of the author before and thought I would take a chance on it being worthwhile. Wrong! I thought the text of the book dragged on and on, especially the beginning when he was following Gina. This guy is unbelievable to put up with all the antics in Ireland with her and her family, and hard to believe anyone would try to continue a relationship with such an unstable and looney woman! I found the language written in the Irish slang hard to follow and get the gist of the meaning of these words. I felt he overused some of the obscene language and the use of ""feckin"" on almost every page. I usually pass on my novels to a friend of mine, but am unsure if I will do so with this one, I am surprised I even finished reading it."
4,A Great learning book for children,As with all the eyewitness books its a great factual book for children to learn. The book is full of many pictures each with annotations describing in simple detail what is going on in the picture. The books are full of knowledge and enjoyable for both children and adults alike!I recommened buying this book for your child if they are wanting to learn about battle.
2,ok but not that smart,"OK this is a great cover however the clear screen cover is hard and you can't use your ""x"" on the top left because the plastic cover does not stretch, I love Krusell but this one is not a great one due to the plastic over making it impossible to use some of the touch screen features"
5,Kendall Bell has compiled a truly inspirational book,"This book has something for everyone. Writers from across the United States contributed stories and poems. Some of the stories made me cry and some made me laugh. One story in particular, written by Kendall Bell's daughter, moved me profoundly. It was about a friend she lost in high school, but it wasn't maudlin. It was beautifully written, as were so many other stories in this book. I kept the book by my bed and read one or two stories a night. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be entertained, touched, and inspired."
4,Good toy as reward or for the car ride.,I use this toy as reward for therapy with my clients. The kids love it and enjoy scoring points. I think this could also be great as a toy to keep the kids occupied in the car as well.
5,"Gregg Karukas delivers again""","Veteran keyboard maven Gregg Karukas returns with his latesteffort "" Looking Up' a terrific smooth ride. Featuring a stellarsupporting cast that includes Peter White, Richard Smith, Thom Rotella and Michael O'Neill, this is a terrific CD from start to finish! Highly recommended!Joseph BertieSmooth Jazz fanaticWoodside,New York"
4,grips,very comfortable and easy to install overall good quality but does not fit perfectly although very close but I am picky
2,Waste of money,"This is an inferior wood holder. Logs fall out, it doesn't look nice on the fireplace and is awkward to move. I have already donated it for someone else to deal with."
1,Carrier part not very durable,"As others have suggested, the metal part is fine but the carrier itself is not very durable. It started to tear after about a week of use, so I'm sending it back for a refund and will look for something that is leather or canvas."
5,"Good product, great price","This product works very well and makes bringing in wood a breeze. I was a little concerned because of some of the other reviews, but ordered it anyway and am very pleased. Well made and a bargain."
1,Buyer Beware,A very cheap product - carrier is only good to carry kindling wood to start a fire - poorly constructed and not worth the cost.
4,pleasantly surprised,When I ordered this product I didn't realize it was two pieces. I was surprised when I got it and realized that the main part of it is like a tote that you can put the logs in and carry them to the fireplace and it also serves as a log rack that keeps your logs handy for use. So it wasn't exactly what I expected but I do like it and it was less expensive. Right now I am living on unemployment so cheap is good.
3,"Not bad, Not great","I guess I don't know what I was expecting to get for the price, but it looks so sturdy in the picture. It's just a couple rods with a piece of wrinkly fabric in the middle. I'll be buying a better one soon, so this will do for now but I would not recommend this product. Just because I would tell people to spend a few more bucks to get a much better quality."
2,Poorly made,"The fabric insert is poorly made. Returning it requires the buyer to pay shipping, beware, don't purchase this product if you want something that will last!"
1,Disappointing!,"No voice info to go along with photos. Photos mostly grass, leaves, plants, and only a few of any buildings, etc. No way of knowing where the photos were taken. No info at all. Nice music, but very disappointing!"
3,my disk was skippy,"Good movie, the manga was better. Mine was used and annoyed me because the end skipped a lot- during the last part!!"
5,Spiral into. Get sucked in,"This is literelly one of the best horrors that has introduced itself onto the market, and the best japanesse horrors sense (organ). The other reviewers sceem to dislike the questionable ending. They obviouselly dont watch a lot of david lynch movies. It dosent give you all the answers right in from of you but to make your own conclusion draw what ever you think. The movie also does a number of things to mess with your mind, just turn the lights down low, pay close attention to things in the background and things that shouldnt be their i wont tell you specifics. The special effects are litterelly amazing. I cant even imagine how they did some of them. And the cinematography is breathtaking. I cant imagine anyone that liked ringu or even ring, organ, the eye, tomie, exc.. should love this even more. also any lynch or daVid cRoneNberG. Or just want to watch a great horror movie."
1,Worst movie EVER!!,"I purchased this movie based upon the reviews and recommendations from others on Amazon.com who ( I assumed ) had watched it and liked it. Not knowing the titles or directors of good erotica, I based my decision on those comments. I have to say, and I'm usually NOT one to go off griping about things that don't deliver on their ""advertised"" qualities, but this was by far and without a doubt the WORST movie of ANY category I have ever seen. I considered selling it on e-bay just to recover some of the cost, but I refuse to subject any poor unsuspecting man (or woman) to this garbage. If you're looking for something to set the --mood-- this movie will NOT do it."
3,This is a WARNING:,"This IS NOT a review of this film, this is a warning.NC-17 is a bold understatement. I have never seen a film with an NC-17 rating with pornographic content. When I say pornographic, I don't mean ""late-night Cinemax"", I mean if you were to rent this movie, it would be in the ""back room"" of the video store.Not for everyone.Again, the NC-17 rating means absolutely nothing."
2,Ouch!,"Don't get me wrong I can go for the erotic every now and then but this was ridiculous. The characters were to underdeveloped and from the beginning all you see is sex, sex, sex. I would have liked it more if they mentioned each characters background, especially what the wife thought about Sada. The scene when she was on her period, in my opinion was disgusting. and the part when she touched the filthy bum I wanted to throw up. The end shocked me because ole girl pulled a Bobbitt move that they actually showed. Not the best erotic film I have seen. Definitely not sensual enough. All the sex they were having got boring after awhile and there conversations were almost always the same. More like softcore porn."
1,NOT WHAT IT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN,"If you are looking for a film that daringly and honestly deals with the complexity of human sexuality, jealousy and obsession...this isn't it. Either get Andy Warhol's ""Flesh"" or ""Heat"" or read the book ""No Longer Human"" by Osamu Dazai. The film seems to cling to the idea that by being shocking it will convulse you into some kind of intellectual moment of satori. You'll probably just convulse, though. It's just another circus side show like ""Caligula"" was, masquerading as art. What is really troubling is the misogyny of the film. It plays into the ancient, and worn out, myth of women as really being obsessed sexual monsters out to destroy male sexual power, symbolized at the end of the film. The women in this film are either weak, whiny or depraved. The men are victims of the sexual wiles of women, willing victims perhaps, but victims. Spare yourself this one."
2,A Shameful Transfer From A Shameful Company,"Fox Lorber should have a clue that they are in fact releasing some of the most important films ever made. They seem to destroy the essence of the work by directly transfering their videos directly to DVD. This film is no exception, and by all means stay away from it. Sure, it might look nice in your collection, people coming over and saying, ""Wow! You have 'In The Realm Of The Senses"" on DVD!"" But after they see how bad the transfer and the delayed subtitles are, they know that you just bought yourself an expensive drink coaster. My copy is currently in a used bin at a local record store. I think I'll wait for a better transfer, or buy the Region 2 Japanese release. (25 years later, finally available in Japan) Beware, I warned you, and so did many others on this page."
1,"Buy Obayashi's ""Sada"" instead","Pretty much just crud. The people who saw this as high art in the 70's have to be really embarrassed now. Take it as a warning, when the best quote they can come up with on the jacket is from Madonna.As a positive, the lead actress has incredible dimples.Buy Obayashi's ""Sada"" instead from Home Vision. Same story, but done by a director with some real artistic ability."
2,Madmike,"The DVD had two sessions - backbends and forward bends. Some of the poses in the forward bends session are very difficult. The really unfortunate aspect of this DVD is that there's no menu selection that allows you to immediately start a session. You either have to sit through the opening dialog for each session or keep hitting the next button. The DVD should have at least three sessions, minimize the opening dialog, and provide better verbal instruction through each pose."
4,Not so much for beginners,"I LOVE Patricia Walden. I think she's the best yoga instructor out there. Her form, style, flow, cueing, everything is just spot on. i purchased this dvd thinking that my beginning practice could use a step up as far as flexibility was concerned. Well although Patricia makes it look easy, and she provides suggestions for modifications and props, I suggest you start a little slowly with this one. It's a good dvd if you're looking for flexibility, but you really need to know a little about what you're doing to really follow her. I suggest that you keep on with your Rodney Yee, or whom ever you're doing, and just add this in a little at a time. Patricia really goes for it and she expects you will too."
5,Awesome,"This tape has more depth than any other tape in this genre. Yes, it is challenging, but so is life.However, I agree with the other reviewers that it is not for beginners; I would recommend it for the intermediate level student as well as the advanced.The student simply needs to have some good body alignment and correct muscle usage before embarking on this quest."
4,Challenging tape,"I enjoyed this tape, but wouldn't recommend it to those who haven't taken a yoga class before. Some of the poses were pretty tough, but I just went as far as I could go and didn't worry about what Patricia Walden was doing. If I had worried about that, I'd have easily gotten discouraged! Also, you don't have to do a posture if it feels like you aren't ready for it. Just try doing some other gentle stretches in place of what Patricia is doing, and then move on to the next pose with her. All in all, a good tape, I still recommend classes first so that you are more familiar with the basics."
4,wireless connection,I got this so my daughter had a wireless connection in her room with her desktop computer since I only have one modem
2,I wouldn't recommend Netgear WG111US Wireless G for continuous use,"I installed the Netgear WG111US Wireless G USB Adapter on my Windows 7 PC and it was done without hassles. Just plugged it in the USB port and it was ready to install. The drivers, USB cable and software for this wireless adapter are included in the package too.It has a cover, so when not in use I can cap it to prevent dust accumulation and with 128-bit WEP encryption it is a safe option for data. Signal strength is very unpredictable. Sometimes it's excellent and the next minute it's not there. Losing connectivity amidst an important work can be annoying. Being bulky, it makes it impossible to use another USB port located close to where it has been plugged.Several times my computer failed to recognize. Need to unplug and then re-plug in. Just too many flaws for wireless stuff"
3,Been round the world.,"I bought this back in 08 so I could access crappy wireless networks better. I have to say it did last. A couple VERY hot Summers, and Very cold witers, IN the elements... It is tough. Just make sure to install the files before hand. And when your useing it, it seems to slow down the connection a bit. Overall, Its very simple and easy to use, and durable. Not top of the line stuff, but it gets it done. I gave it 3 stars since I do remeber haveing some problems connecting... Its been a while since I used it to be able to tell exactly what... And Ive seen better ones out there. Ive also seen a WHOLE lot worse. 7 out of a 10."
1,cannot recommend,"Pain to configure. Flaky connection at best. When I removed the software, I got a user interface failure (RtGina2.dll failed to load) which was rather annoying to have to fix."
3,Not for beginners,"It doesn't say that this book is meant for beginners, but since I am a beginner I wanted to warn all those intending to learn chess openings for the first time against buying this book. There is nothing wrong with the book, but don't expect any explanations as to why things are the way they are. While reading this book, as some other reviewer already said, I kept asking myself ""why?"" again and again. Things are just not explained! They might be obvious for the intermediate/advanced player, but then again why would an intermediate/advanced player be reading this book? The reason why I give 3 stars is not only because it is not a book for beginners, but because I wonder who the audience for this book actually is.This was my first chess book and after reading 40 pages I am planning on buying one of those ""... move by move"" books. It seems like there are some very good ones out there.Just my two cents."
2,"Some Interesting Things, But Nothing Spectacular","Althoug a commercially sucessful band, Bush were never one of the most innovative or creative groups around. Their rock-grunge combination presented some competent, solid songs in wildly uneven records. Their thir release is no exception, just another album that brings nothing new but still has two or three moments that sparkle nonetheless.This time the band approached a more electronic-oriented direction, going for some experimentation in their sound. Despite this change, most of the songs here still seem like a rehash of previous material, failing to engage and truly surprise. Some atmospheric and laid-back moments like ""40 Miles From the Sun"" or ""Letting the Cables Sleep"" are interesting and captivating enough, but for the most part the results are average and not too memmorable. This is a listenable and alright effort, but it gets tiresome fast and there are no big reasons to return to it afterwards.A decent and somewhat lackluster rock album."
1,Bush used to be better,"First of all, I'm not an anti-bush person, I've been to their concert and I have their two previous albums. I just think that this new album is a poor effort to put Bush back under the spotlight. Whatever message they tried to pass with this new album simply didn't get through. This is the most god awfull piece of c**p I've ever heard. I mean what the hell are those electronic beats on The Chemicals Between Us? There are absolutelly NO good songs in this album, not a single catchy guitar riff, nothing. I can only hope that Bush will eventually snap out of this creative blank and show up with a decent album as soon as possible."
4,Reallly good,"I have all of the bush cds and I think this one is the best one. There are some fairly quite songs on this cd and that is nice for a change but don't worry bush is still the same. really good,"
4,Science of things brings bush back to their roots,"Bush has really come up with a good album here. Much like 16 stone, the science of things really uses all their talent, in both songwriting and playing. I'm not a huge Bush fan, but i was turned onto this album the first time I heard it. A MUST HAVE"
4,Totally Rocks,"This CD totally rocks. It is somewhat similar to Sixteen Stone and VERY similar to Razorblade Suitcase. However, there seems to be more techno-type background, very much like that on their remix of Mouth from the American Warewolf in Paris soundtrack. I really enjoy this CD and recommend it to any Bush or rock fan."
3,"It's alright, I guess","Back when Razonblade Suitcase was out, I was really into Bush. But the new album was kind of a dissappointment. It's not that it's a bad album, it's just that all the songs kind of blend together. The only song on the album that I can really get into is The Chemicals Between Us. The rest of the songs just sort of all sound the same. You'll probably like this album if you like their earlier stuff, but if this is your first Bush album, get Razorblade Suitcase."
5,GREAT CD,"I think that the Science of things is a great CD. I still think 6teen Stone is better, but this one is better than Razorblade Suitcase. BUSH still rocks and i hope they will just keep coming with this great music."
3,Least likable of the three Bush releases.,"I'm a huge Bush fan & have to honestly say that this cd is my least favorite of the three. ""Chemicals Between Us"" isn't a bad tune & there are a couple jamming other songs, but it's just not the same kinda rip-roaring sound as they put out for SixteenStone & Razorblade Suitcase. It's a slow starting cd, but it'll eventually grow on you."
5,One of those classics you can see again and again,"I've watched this twice now on the Romance Channel and loved it more each time. The characters are so right in the parts they play and the love that grows between the main characters is not sudden but develops nicely. I hope the company rereleases it again, I want to purchase it, it's a classic."
3,Drys out fast.,Doesn't seem to do anything. Lube is like ky but not as good and drys out faster. Worth a try
2,Roof Garden,"I am interested every thing about Roof Garden for example about soil ,irregation,countaner,new system,all phd teses program,etc ."
2,Mediocre,I have read Hellers books before and have loved them so I was anxious to read this one as well. I really enjoyed the first half of the book dealing with the mother - daughter struggles but lost interest with the corny second half dealing with the mothers loser boyfriend. Not up to the same standards as her usual work.
4,A wonderful read,"Great book that was funny and easy to read. Good storylne, maybe a bit frustrating at times how the mither ignores the daughter, but overall great book with a good ending - already have checked out many more Jane Heller books from the library."
3,Fell A Bit Flat,"This book was amusing in a Jane Heller kind of way. However, it wasn't quite as good as her usual fare.Helen started out so annoying that I couldn't care less about her. And Stacey was such a wimp where her mother was concerned that I found it nearly impossible to care about her either, especially after she succumbed to going on a tour of a tuna fish factory just because her mother bullied her into it. Grow a spine, woman! I thought the romance with Jack had potential, but it was introduced so early and nothing really happened there either to make me care much about it.The whole thing was very predictable with no twists and turns to surprise you even a little bit. It was a busy read, more than an enjoyable read as Ms. Heller's books usually are."
1,Too much hype for boring movie,"This movie came with a lot of hype. If they were trying to be shocking they failed. If you want shock try grindhouse roughies. This film was filled with poor acting and poor filming. There was nothing scary or profound. I have always been a fan of hardcore horror and shock film from Japan and early grindhouse. This was tame, boring and very vanilla. It is silly to try and promote this as a hardcore sadist movie when it truly looks like vanilla bad M/s play. The only good thing about the movie was the cute bunny mask.."
4,Who would enjoy this book?,"There is a niche audience for this book - anyone old enough to attend an Elderhostel program; those who have attended and find it fun to recognize the people and situations they have experienced; readers who welcome an amusing, non-violent, and literate 'dectective' story. I look forward to the next adventure of this attractive, elderly couple."
3,so so,"this game no suply my spectatives, the sound is no funny and is not real, i dont know if is diferent but no is good"
1,DONT BUY THIS TOY,THIS TOY IS STUPID DONT BUY IT. YOU NEED TO BLOW UNTIL YOU GET LIGHTHEADED TO MAKE A FART NOISE. AND THE FART NOISE DOESNT EVEN SOUND REAL.
1,bad duck call,i purchased this as a joke for a uptight family member took it out of pakage sounds like a sick duck sound ha ha jokes on me
5,Elvis R & B,"Now, this is THE album! Excellent Elvis songs, and does anyone else know that Elvis has the best beat to walk to? Well, he does for me anyway and he was a real artist, you can understand the words and it's ""electric"" music. God save the King!"
4,"A very good Intro to ActiveX and VBScript, but ...","This book does a very good job of getting you right into ActiveX, and then slowly adds the VBScript. While the examples on the CD are well documented, I couldn't get a few of them to work (SelectedIndex) for one. However, I would recommend this book as both a good reference and usuable tool. Note that you should have a pretty good understanding of HTML. If you don't, you'll have problems, but the CD has an HTML book on it that is easily indexed. It helped me out greatly."
3,Very Good Television Mini-series,"Like any good book that is made into a mini-series - Princess Daisy has all the qualities that we look for in bringing printed characters to life on screen. There is lying, cheating, seduction and of course love. I enjoyed the film; in fact I'll be sure to watch it again."
5,This is the best brand on the market,"I was spending like 60.00 at whole foods for the Source Natural Silver and while its ok, it doesnt compare to Silver Biotics from American Biotech. I have spent about 80.00 on silver from Purest Silver, which is some New Jersey Company that sends junk in a bottle, and it was useless on colds or on a staph infection.I used like two other brands of silver, and it wasnt even Collidal but Ionic Silver, which means that it should be used on the outside of the body and not taken internally but of course none of these companies appear to ever tell the public about these differences.So, I saw this brand in the GNC when looking for something for a staph infection being that the Rx toxic Big Pharma Creams from my doctor were useless and I likely picked up the Staph from the doctors office in the first place, and this Silver Biotic knocked out my staph infection in 48 hours and it isnt that costly, like lesser brands."
4,"Great Price, Great Sheets","For the price (under $20), these flannel sheets are excellent. The sheets are soft and warm and have 'deep pockets' for those larger mattresses."
5,Pleasantly surprised,These sheets were surprisingly soft after just one washing. We have had them on our bed for several nights now and they are exceptionally comfortable and warm. They also appear to be very well made. We were pleasantly surprised by how much quality we got for the money.
1,"Not Flannel, color on one side only.","If you are familiar with flannel sheets (we have used them for more than ten years) and you are considering these, do not buy them. They were very stiff out of the package, so I washed them using a fabric softener and added a Bounce sheet to the dryer. They were still stiff, with no fuzz to speak of. No way am I going to be sleeping on these. Save your money and try a different brand. They are also the first sheets I have ever seen that are color printed on one side and white on the other. These would not be a deal at half the price."
2,"Cute, but very scratchy. Not soft at all. :(","I was very disappointed in these sheets. Though the gingham is really cute with my comforter, these feel like thick 180 count sheets. I don't recommend them unless you need something cute for the spare bedroom."
4,nice a little stiff but for the price? who can complain?,These look more checkered than the photo. Like your normal country checkered table cloth design...would look good w/ a rose type print for a laura ashley type feel. They are flannel and warm. Seem to be well sewn and the fabric is thick. Will need to wash a few times to soften up (I havent done this Ill come back and add the review if in washing they change color or fall apart) but from what I can see this is cheaper than what you can get at walmart and seems to be pretty good quality. Its a full on red not a mauve.
1,If You Weren't There You Missed the Concert of the Century,"A Total Dissappointment, there were 4 reasons to go to this Concert.....AC/DC, The Guess Who, Rush and of Course the Rolling Stones! There is only 2 AC/DC songs on this video, who were by far the Highlight of the Show who played 12 amazing songs and deserved alot more songs on the video as well as the stones. It was a waste of money I only bought the video because I went to the concert."
4,How politics affect one's family life,This book gives a clear semi-deep picture of the communist beliefs and policies through the life of the writer and her family. I liked it a lot especially because the writer's parents had positions within the party which gave me a better understanding of how the political life her parents lived reflected on their family life.
2,Wild Swans used book purchase from Amazon,Surprised and not at all pleased to see notations written in pen in the book's margins.I would never present a book for re-sale with a single mark in it and didn't know Amazon did so.
2,"Well, the first quarter of the book is good...","I delved into this book immediately, relishing the wonderful description of a life so alien to my own. I could admire the dedication of Chang's mother, grandmother, and father when they were presented historically.Then the chick started talking about herself, and it all went downhill.Interesting events turned to petty, schoolgirl tales. Wondering about the noble intentions of people changed to reading -- over and over again -- whiny justifications of ignorance and stupidity. And even worse, it seems as if the editor lost interest in the book at about the same place, since the self-obsessed nonsense goes on and on and on...By all means, read the first part -- but stop before you too resent the hours wasted on the later drivel!"
5,Wild Swans: Three Doughters of China,It is one of the best books I have ever read. It really makes you aware of the horrors that the people of china have had to suffer.
3,Wild Swans,"This book is a memoir by a Chinese woman detailing experiences of three generations of women. It's value is in demonstrating the inhumanity of man to man, particularly what transpired from the end if the warlord eras through the Kuomintang to the Communist takeover. It is difficult to read the litany of atrocities and tortures that take place but it also educates one on the horrors of an autocratic system. You must have a strong stomach to read it. The saving grace, in my opinion, is the strength of the women who make up the family structure and are the backbone of resistance while enduring an extremely difficult life."
4,The Accidental Path To Sharing,"The value in this book is its uniqueness. That a person can survive the myriad paths to destruction that was the Cultural Revolution, then become as proficient in English so that we can understand her language; this is a most unlikely sequence. Fortunately for us the unlikely became manifest. The value of this book is its view of a place in human history completely different from that which any us Westerners will have ever known."
2,Terribly written book on some rather exceptionaly exciting subjects.,"It is quite difficult to determine if this book is a documentary or a novel. The overall style of narration points to it being a documentary, while some, rather out of place phrases, such as `he walked away into a snowy night', attempt to present it with a flavor of a novel. While English is clearly not the writer's native tongue, it is hard to overlook editor's poor job. A published work should not have blunders such as ""teachers demanded a pay rise"". While the subject of Chinese (and for that matter, World) history in 20th century is very exciting and one learns a lot from the book, dealing with 5th grade level English is rather frustrating and soon becomes very tiring."
1,Book was dirty and marked with black markers,"I ended up returning this because my ""new"" book was dirty on three sides and marked up with a marker. The price at the time was great though. I think if the description had said dirty book with marker then consumers could make an informed decision whether that would bother them."
5,"A fascinating, beautifully written, unforgettable true story",Wild Swans is the best account of the struggle Chinese women have endured through the generations that I have ever read. Jung Chang is a truly excellent writer with a gift for portraying the past.
4,"Engaging , interesting a Classic",Lovely story threading through China's recent past through the eyes of three generations of women.A must to read if one is visiting China
1,Waste of Time,"This a very poor attempt of Halo Recon or Star Ship Troopers, what a waste of time and effort for the fans."
5,very soft,I got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. They are super soft and have a thick sole for comfortable walking. I would definately buy them again !
1,Can I have my money back please?,"Boring. I put on this DVD thinking I could relax, having a few laughs etc. Instead I found this an extremely confusing ""cartoon"". I know the ESPN-ish style is new but not for a show targeted at kids. Yes and there is the sarcastic humor (like Chicken's dad is a KFC style bucket - therefore he never knew his dad) but ""The Simpsons"" did this better.Can I have my money back and change it for a Disney Classic Movie - they know how to do cartoons better? In the meantime Sony, please concentrate on the Marvel movies and Sony Pictures Classics."
3,Kind of cute!,My boys are 2 and 4. This didn't seem to capture them although my husband and I thought it was kind of cute. Not really for kids like the television advertising has you believe.
2,Classical story- could have been done better,"The audio mixing on this movie is terrible. The story is humorous but not exactly a blast. It's a classical story of the hero growing up towards what he thinks he wants and then growing above that to find what is really important. Is NOT badly made, just mediocre.Not so bad if you wanna use the story to teach a kid."
5,Surf's Up presents a unique perspective in storytelling...,"For an animated film, ""Surf's Up"" presents a unique perspective in storytelling as it focuses on a ""behind the scenes"" documentary on the life of a young surfer penguin named Cody Maverick (voiced by Transformers' star Shia LaBeouf). The film features several themes such as the concepts of having fun; patience; friendship; selflessness; and sadly depression as well. However, this animated sports comedy is certainly one for the entire family as each member leaves the cinema with their own interpretation of the film.Some things to watch out for: The different colors of the eccentric Tank ""The Shredder"" Evans' eyes; Surf's Up's classic soundtrack; and surfing promoter, Reggie Belafonte's (voiced by James Woods) Don King hairstyle."
4,Sports Ring Toss,I'm satisfied with the product I received. It will be used at our annual military beach picnic at Camp Pendleton.
2,poor value-excellent customer service!!,this item wasn't worth the price....not anywhere near it!!!! BUT when i phoned the dealer they were more helpful than you'd ever expect ... a topnotch customer service dept !! so in rating them i gave the item 2 stars but the business and their customer service 5 stars!!
5,"An Aesthetic, Moral Story With a Mystery Involved","A wonderful story about the importance of telling the truth. Ping is the subject of a Chinese emperor who is exceptionally gifted at growing things. When it is time for the old king to choose his successor, he tests the children of the land by giving them each a seed to cultivate and bring to him within a year. Ping is unable to get this seed of all seeds to grow, and brings his empty pot to the king, whereupon the king reveals his wisdom in a surprise ending.This is an aesthetic, moral story with an enjoyable mystery and very nice illustrations. Caring for plants is a central part of the story, and the ability to get a plant flourish may be symbolic for nurturing a kingdom. Although he gives his best, Ping fails at getting the seed to grow. Nevertheless, he demonstrates courage in presenting his empty pot, and his honesty is well rewarded."
5,Such a neat book!,We really like this book. It makes kids really think about doing the right thing and being honest. It's great!
5,Beautiful Story!,Our family loves this book! It is a truly wonderful story that teaches such lessons as the importance of hard work and honesty! There is just something about this book that warms your heart!
5,A REALLY GOOD STORY,Bought this book for a youth book club I am starting. This story has a really good moral. I think the children will enjoy the illustrations and the story. It doesn't seem too hard for a child to read. I also look forward to reading it to my grandson one day. I'm also glad that the main character in the book is a boy. I think that will make it more interesting for the boys in the book club. I recommend this book to others and it came highly recommended to me.
2,Not what expected,"I wanted a copy of this book for my classroom, but nowhere did the order page indicate that the book would be a BIG book (18"" x 18"") like the kind used in kindergarten classes. I ended up keeping the book only because I loved the story and I didn't have the time or energy to go through a return hassle. Hopefully Amazon will correct their order information. Next time I'll read the reviews first... someone else had the same experience."
1,Warning! This book is HUGE and not for your average household!,"I wish I would have read the other 1-star review before ordering. We wanted this book for our children. It came highly recommended by their Principal. However, it never occurred to us to examine the book dimensions. How I wish we had. We are returning the item and locating a more size appropriate version."
4,worth the wait.,"I waited a week for this album to drop to me in England,and i wasn't dissapointed.I think the way Krayzie switches his tracks between his good and evil side is excellent.I have all the Bone group and solo albums and this one is deffinately up there, although i must admit that up to press i think krayzie's best album is Thug Mentality.I Got Bone Brothers on the way,and i can't see myself being dissapointed with that either! peace."
4,Good to have... could be better though.,"This is a good helper to make it through Plato's Republic. However, some of the most important parts (e.g. the abolition of the family and the equality of women) are skipped over. Also, the term paper ideas are not very original... most college students could come up with these ideas on their own. But, it does help if you have trouble interpreting the Socratic dialogs. For the price, it's a good deal."
4,GOOD Book!!!,"This book is good!!! Should read it because it helps you realize things you took for granted after finishing read it. So read it, if didn't! ;D"
3,ENJOYABLE,"I agree with one of the other reviewers, these young men limit their vocal ability by trying to sing out of their range. They need to stick to the old style gospel tempo."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I saw this movie for the first time just over ten years ago the weekend before I graduated from college. I was suprised how much I connected to it. It was extremely funny and has some of the best lines of any movie I can remember, but it also just seemed to have a certain something to it that really nailed how I was feeling at the time. After rewatching it again recently, it has a certain timelessness to it. It doesn't feel dated at all. The special features are great as well."
5,A long seach has ended.,"I've been looking for this single cd for a long time. I wanted the song Pain by 2Pac, it's a great song. The seller was good, product was just as described. Price was a lot higher then I wanted to pay, but there are not a lot of copies out there for purchase."
5,zine reader's dream,"Cristy Road is an inspiration to all zine publishers. Well, more accurately, Cristy Road is an inspiration to me. Her stories have heart, humor, and thoughtful content. She is well-known, of course, as an amazing graphic artist, and her drawings in this graphic novel leave nothing wanting. The layout is visually pleasing and tight. Her semi-chronological stories trace her relationships, epiphanies and unique experiences as a queer Latina in Florida and beyond. Buy this book. Then write to her and tell her how awesome she is:[...]"
5,Love this CD !,My Brother-in-law frist introduce me to these singers and when I heard them sing I was amazed at these men voices and the music. The saxaphone player was awesome and so were the other musicians. I highy recomend this CD and I wish this group would come up with another CD.
5,Fantastic Follow Up,"After reading Daughter of the Forest, I was eagerly awaiting Son of the Shadows, and I was not disappointed the main story is of Liadan, Sorcha's youngest daughter and it is full of mystical folk law tales and adventure. If you enjoyed Daughter of the Forest then Son of the Shadows is a must read."
4,Cool!,"I really liked this book, and it was a GREAT sequal to Daughter of the Forest. However, I have one and only one complaint. Liadan was too perfect. In the next book, Child of the Prophecy, Fianne makes mistakes. She doesn't always turn the right way. Liadan always does. Her only mistake is in saving Evan, the smith, and that she couldn't prevent. I now know Dog, Snake, Spider, and Rat very well and must admit that they steal the show from Liadan. I LOVE them!"
4,Good...but,"I loved the story, but this lady makes me mad. A lot of Sorcha's appeal in the previous book came from her relateablity, in this book they put her on a god-like pedestal, WHY! It snnoys me to no end! WHY"
3,Mehhhh....,"If you're looking to read a book as good as the first in this series, (Daughter of the Forest) then forget it, Son of the Shadows simply does not live up to its excellent predecessor. Liadan, the heroine of this novel, is characterized in a way as to make her too perfect and very hard to sympathize with. She endures none of the hardship which her mother went through and this makes it difficult to bond with her strife. Her tale is essentially a love story with some action and magic in the mix. This book was a disappointment to me. The authors writing remains as strong as before but I felt that she was simply weaving out a plot instead of creating the believable world I found reading the first novel."
1,"NOT A ""MOVIE""","This DVD is not a ""movie"" It features these ""experts"" talking through most of it with Pajanimals songs placed throughout. Don't waste your money!"
4,Garmin cord,this cord is working out well. my old cord was making my GPS battery die out and i was stuck on the road with no GPS. The new cord holds the charge very well.
3,Garmin nuvi 350 DC charger,"DC CAR ADAPTER CHARGER FOR Garmin Nuvi: 200, 200W, 205, 205W, 215T, 250, 250W, 255, 255W, 260, 260W, 265T, 265WT, 270, 275T, 300, 310, 350, 360, 370, 500, 550 & FOR TomTom: ONE 3rd Edition, ONE XL, ONE XLS, ONE 130, ONE 130S, ONE XL-330, ONE XL-330S, GO...This is a replacement for the original charger. The original charger lasted about 2 years and worked very well until the end came apart that plugs into the car dash receptacle. Some of the parts on the end were lost and repairs could not be made. The new charger works well. I will inspect the end piece regurarly and hope to avoid the problem of the original. I would rate it 5 stars otherwise."
3,"Fine, but...","This works fine. Wouldn't it be nice if these cords had some way to be routed so that the cable didn't trail across the knobs, levers, and other controls on the dashboard and steering wheel?"
2,Had to replace it three times,I received this with my Nuvi 350. Within 3 months I had to replace it. I have since replaced it three times within two years. When it works it works well.
4,Arrived as described,"This power cord appears to be a bit more flexible than the cord that was supplied with the original unit (a good thing). We'll hope that this one lasts a bit longer, but so far I'm pleased with the performance."
1,This power cord disables navigation when in use.,"I purchased this product to replace broken Garmin Nuvi Navigation power cord. The shipment was great but the product sucks. It works in that it charges the Garmin but it does not allow navigation to be in use when it's charging. I thought there was something wrong with the Navigation but figured out it was the power cord that disables the navigation when its in plugged into the power cord. So when Navigation is unplugged from the charger, the Navigation is operational. Otherwise, when in charge mode it gives you a black screen with picture of it being charged.Don't get this charger if you want to your navigation charging and be operational at the same time.If I had known this, I wouldn't have wasted my money purchasing this.Now, I have to go out an buy a new one because it's too inconvenient."
2,Not for Nuvi 660,"You do not need to buy this charger for the Nuvi 660. The 660 comes with a charger that connects through the mount adaptor, not directly to the 660. This works on a Nuvi 660 to supply power, but it will not charge the battery."
1,not as pictured,Although the product will work it is not what I thought I was getting. I believe it is a copy of the original. Then end is stright and not at an angle as shown in the picture. I was disappointed with my purchase.
4,well built for the price,"I must have an unusually deep charger port because the original charger kept popping out. So, I replaced it with this new one. It keeps popping out as well. The product received was well built for a very reasonable price. I priced them at stores for 3 times the price. It arrived quickly and was actually better built than I expected. Unfortunately my car charger is not cooperating. If it were just a tad deeper I think we'd be golden."
3,NUVI CORD,"TURNS OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE CORD, BUT THE DEVICE ITSELF, SO IT WAS MONEY WASTED, NOT THE SUPPLIER'S FAULT"
2,somewhat satified,"Not the identical item shown on picture, though it works, I could have gotten it for a better price had I known."
2,Misleading image - Not the same as the original Garmin Nuvi charger!,"I purchased this charger to replace an original Garmin Nuvi charger (360) that stopped working.The charger works and charges, however it does not have the same low profile up angle USB B male connector as the original had. The connector on the one I ordered is not low profile at all! It is fat and bulky.Annoying, since I basically cannot use it with my RAM Nuvi cradle.Even the black charger does not look the same as the one in the photo - the ordered one has a green led on the side, not a flat integrated on the bottom as the image, and the ordered one has grooves - the image has a flat plastic cover.Will return it.2 stars and not one because it does charge, but it is still useless to me."
2,Item returned....credit never received,"I returned this item along with the dashboard mount. I received credit for the dashboard mount but I did not receive credit for this item. Please advise.Thanks,Carl Meeks"
1,No good,This item was offered as an ascessory for the GPS 765 we received this item before the Gps arrived so the package was opened. once GPS came tried it did not fit the gps. Very disappointed. fit the GPS 200 series.
5,Very good,"Works well.Better than the original even though it shouldn't be the way (the original should be the same, I think)."
1,Updated - Item failed,"Received the product in a timely manner. Worked as advertised and at a fair price. Saved $s over the original equipment manufacturer's price.Updated 10/29/2010Product failed during auto trip (only third time I used it). Had to stop at an out of town box store and buy an ""official"" Garmin charger. This was my first experiment buying a third party electronics item and I won't be doing so again. Ultimately you get what you pay for."
1,This is not necessary!!!!,"I couldn't find a contents listing for the GPS I purchased. On the GPS page (Garmin nuvi 275) it said this was purchased along with the GPS unit. So, I thought I needed it. Not so. The GPS came with this along with the USB cable. Don't be mislead by Amazon advertising. I can't actually rate this item since I did not remove it from the packaging and use it. I'm sending it back to Amazon."
1,Poor Quality Product,It did not work when i received it. Called the seller and they replace it immediately. The second one stopped working after a month. The product is not made to last. No wonder it was cheap in price. Would not recommend it at all.
3,Watch out!,"I ordered this for a Garmin Nuvi 360 based on Amazon's description of the 360 which seemed to indicate that a car charger was not part of the package. I had purchased a Nuvi 350 two years ago for about 350 dollars, about 100 dollars less than the 360 at the time. When I purchased the 360 as a christmas gift it's price was only about 170 dollars so I figured that they had cut out some of the items included in the package previously. Furthermore Amazon said that people who bought the Nuvi 360 often purchased the car charger with it. Well, the Nuvi 360 has a car charger as part of the package so you don't need a car charger unless you want to keep a spare or put one in a second car. Mine is still sealed and I will probably return it since my daughter doesn't need a second charger and neither do I."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered the power cable from Amazon after it appeared as an accessory for the Garmin Nuvi I had previously ordered. Unfortunately, the cable sent to me was not compatible with the model of Nuvi that I had. I first contacted Amazon.com and then ANTONLINE; but neither organization did anything to help with the problem. I just got long winded e-mails from them that didn't move me one step closer to getting a cable that would work with my Nuvi.It's hard to say which organization's customer service was worse, but I guess I'd have to go with Amazon.com, simply because that was my initial point of contact. You have a HORRIBLE system. It is so bad that it will probably keep me from ordering anything further from Amazon.com"
5,Great teacher book too,"I purchased this book for my 6 year old. Our whole family likes to listen to/read this story about the fuss over a test to see if the kids have learned all they should, if they haven't they'll have to go to DREARY flobbertown. I thought this would be a great gift for one of the BEST first grade teachers I know. She liked it so much she read it to her class the day my son gave it to her."
4,Good book to add to the Dr. Seuss collection,"I bought this book for my daughter and I guess for me too since I've been a Dr. Seuss fan my whole life. This book was started by Dr. Seuss, but he never finished it before he died. It was finished for him. I like to have it in the collection because Dr. Seuss started it, but also because after the story it shows how the book came about. It shows Dr. Seuss' sketches that he would have used if he had finished the book and it also shows his thought process in writing the book, the words he wrote and crossed out and different things that he came up with as he tried to get it just the way he wanted it."
2,"poor transfer,paging criterion","Since we know there is another version of ""Burn"" out there,i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.You can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan,poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.Brando told larry king it was his favorite film;not if he saw this package."
3,the ugly englishman,"the decade before ""the godfather"" was a long period of fallowness for marlon brando, but a viewing of this legendary flop might lead one to try to re-assess the period. in this at times too stridently obvious parallel to our then imperialist foreign policy (thank god we dont get involved in stuff like that any more ...) brando plays a politician / businessman / pirate who serves as both liberator and enslavor of a poor country. while the production values vary greatly, it is still worth checking out for anyone interested in how stanley kowalski morphed into colonel kurtz."
3,Is a bit confusing to decipher which information to use for your child,"I was looking for a book to assist me in ""positive discipline"" with my toddler. I did not find too much in regard to 2 year olds in this book except the obvious advice of keep your children home if their tired unless you want them to act out in the grocery store. There was much helpful advice for older children. I did see a book specifically for toddlers but will not be sold until April. In a book that is for a wide range of ages it wold have been best to explain in chronologically order (ie: 2-4 year olds/ 5-6 year olds etc.) The book went everywhere."
5,Awesome Re-Master,"Rarely, bonus tracks are more than just short or unreleased versions. This CD has bonus tracks worth taking up space since I have not seen them on any other release. This is a must-have for Stray and any other 70s prog-rock fans.The packaging and booklet are nicely done. It is a great addition to my collection."
2,DVD version disappointing--not really widescreen!,"I'd give this film 5 stars, or 10, or 20! But this DVD version is a real disappointment, because as one other reviewer put it, they added ""fake widescreen"" when that's not the way it was originally filmed. If you compare a full screen version on VHS to the letterboxed version on disc, you'll see that some of the picture is missing on the DVD, covered up by the black bars. What's up with that?Criterion did this to ""Time Bandits,"" too, and who knows where else it's been done. I don't get it. I hear they did it on a couple of Kurosawa films, too. It doesn't benefit anyone or anything to do that, it just means a flawed version of these films is the only one available on disc..."
5,Choose Your Honeymoon Well,"Because if you don't, you may wind up embroiled in a murder in a seedy Mexican bordertown! Newlyweds Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh are witnesses to an exploding automobile. Chuck happens to be a police inspector and also a Mexican (yes, that's really supposed to be the truth), and neither fact endears him to local sheriff Orson Welles, at his most bloated and unattractive. One heck of a lot of trouble ensues, trumped up narcotics charges not the least of it all. But I ask you, if you were a frightened bride all alone at an isolated motel like Janet Leigh, would you really strip down to your frilly corset? By the way, Marlene Dietrich has a cameo appearance as a lady of the evening who trades some interesting lines with Welles in an off moment. Certainly NOT a Christmas movie, ""Touch of Evil"" is well photographed and well done, all the way round."
5,"Welle's Great, Tawdry, Incomparable Masterpiece","TOUCH OF EVIL has (as Pauline Kael put it) ""a cast assembled in a nightmare""--Heston, Janet Lee, Marlene Dietrich, Ray Collins, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mercedes McCambridge et al. Don't pay attention to the folks who worry about ""campy"" performances--this is a certified masterpiece, compelling on every level. It also is notable for Dietrich's finest performance after THE BLUE ANGEL; her final line--the last line of the movie--will break your heart."
3,Movie review,"Ya know, I expected a lot more. The movie seemed over-long and there were sequences in it that just did not bring on the suspense that I'd hoped--like the heroine's abduction by some villains...yawn. And Charlton Heston as a ""Mexican""...duhhhh???"
1,Unwatchable,"Filmed mostly at night which renders most scenes dimly lit and extremely hard to see. Additionally, the plot itself is compromised by a jumble of farfetched characters who are difficult to decipher. Are they caricatures, comedic portrayals or something deeper and more sinister? Had to turn it off well before the end."
1,Not a classic in my book,"Orson Welles may have been a great man, but this is no great movie. Greatly boring, yes. Aside from the restored opening sequence of a car exploding, the rest of the film is a jumbled-up mess of shambling actors muttering nonsensical dialogue. My mother went to bed halfway through; my dad fell asleep in his chair, and my husband and I simply laughed and shook our heads in disbelief.I'm not a student of film, so maybe there's some nuances of cinematography or screenplay or something that I'm missing, but I don't think so. I'm standing up to say that the Emperor has no clothes on."
5,What really happened,"Charlton Heston was actually the one who got Orson Welles the job of acting in and directing this great movie.The studios never liked Welles, but Heston was just coming off his huge commercial success in Ben-Hur, and he had enough clout to get Welles this job.As for those complaining about Heston playing a Latino -- hey, without Heston's presence, the thing probably wouldn't have gotten made at all.So give him the credit he's due here. Besides, his performance was plenty good enough to carry the part."
3,Firehouse,"I gotta say, this is probably one of the dumbest movies I ever saw but I collect Julia Roberts movies and this is the first one she appeared in (for about 3 seconds!!) so I am happy to have it in my collection."
2,concrete cutting,"Purchased 5 of these for cutting green concrete with a pro turbo diamond blade. Before burnouts,Saw #1 cut approximately 4000 ft at 7/8 depth , Saw #2 2000 ft , Saw #3 2500 ft , Saw #4 150 ft . We will have to see about # 5...well saw 5 cut 58 feet disappointing. I have no idea why they died quicker as time went on. Should they have an expiration date?"
1,Good Cause; Bad Product,"I am deeply disappointed in this album. There is no one song that even grabs my attention. The artists you know do nothing memorable, and the artists you don't know, well, let's put it this way: There are 'unknown' artists because they choose to remain so, and there are unknow artists because they sxck and no major or indy label will waste the time, money or efforts to publish them. Well, a few of them got their 15 seconds of fame here. Save your money. If you really need it, bootleg it. IT'S THAT BAD."
4,"I love KT Tunstall and I love this CD, however...","the explicit language in the first song is entirely unnecessary and actually takes something away from it. By no means am I a prude (I've been known to drop an f bomb), but really, why ruin a song with crude language?? Also, I love exposing my son to music, and I have to bypass songs such as this due to the language.Other than that one unfortunate word, this CD is fabulous. It is a bit mellower than Eye to the Telescope, but that is just fine by me! Get a glass of wine, sit by the fireplace and listen to it uninterrupted.Also, if you ever get a chance to see her live, by all means do so! I saw her a couple of months ago in a small venue here in Seattle and was completely blown away!This CD comes highly recommended and had it not been for the unnecessary f bomb, would have received five stars by me.Peace out."
4,"great, but complex use",never taught that the procedure take ages to complete when U simply want to messure. the test strip is good for few months only ........not really handy for elderly people
1,Inconsistent results,"I tried this out because it was for free (I hope) as there is a full rebate-by-mail. But, I asked the company for level 2 and 3 test solutions and have yet to receive them... Also, the results were inconsistent with my accucheck which seemed more reliable. This thing told me my blood sugar was fine when I KNEW it was higher than normal."
1,"Product is ""not better than nothing""","This product is ""not better than nothing"", it is worse than nothing. I began to question the results based on the way I feel as all of us pretty much know when our sugar is unusually high or low. I did back to back test (within 30 seconds) and found the spread between the results as much as 60 points one time. No persons blood sugar can change 60pts in 30 seconds. Picked up another exact model meter at the local drug store (they give them away for free) and tested the two meters side by side and received results that differed by 30 points. I'm quite sure I can find a free program on the internet that will generate random numbers which does not require me to bleed before it gives me a number. Since I would like to know my actual blood sugar level, I'll be shopping for another meter.Based on my experience and in my opinion, this product should be removed from the market."
4,"if you love mexican singers, this is one of best!",We got this CD for my Mothers birthday and we all got to enjoy the real feel of a grand party.
2,A Good Guide for low paying markets,"I looked through this book today at a bookstore and found that there were a number of mistakes in the markets. Maybe that was the situation when Ohi wrote the book, I don't know. Also, most of the book was ""filler"" rather than the markets themselves. I have written a lot for the Web, and a large number of the well paying markets were not mentioned in her book either. In fact, I would say that the overwhelming majority of the sites listed in her book are the very low paying ones. I would recommend the online market guide by Anthony and Paul Tedesco over this one."
4,Anything you ever wanted to cook with Mushrooms,This book has been the best companion I have had in the kitchen since I started to enjoy wild mushrooms. It is comprehensive and has a wide variety of recipes. I would suggest this as a must for your kitchen if you are looking for a cookbook with a wide range of recipes for all different types of wild mushrooms.
4,Zen Poems by Bazzano,The work contains sumi-e artwork and Zen poems from the East and Western traditions. Samples are as follows:- Yonder mountain Is where the heat of today has gone. (onitsusa)- I love the rest of my life.Though it is transitoryLike a light azure morning glory. (fusei)This work is perfect for students of Asian and World literature.The volume is fairly representative of unique writings bothEast and West.
5,Nice helmet!,I got this for my daughter as she is going through a pirate phase and this was the closest thing that i liked. It is for ages 5 and up which I don't think was listed in the details. Something else that I don't think was mentioned is the fact that it lights up red led lights when shaken or tapped. I liked the fact that this helmet seems just as well built if not better than the ones I have seen that were over $35.00. The most important thing is she really likes it.
1,This movie is really bad!,"Whoever called this a ""British"" gem must be out of their minds. This is low-budget, bad acting, with I think they are supposed to be ""vampires"", yeah whatever. I know everybody has to make a living, including the ""actors"" in this movie, but unless you have money to GIVE away-don't buy. I'm just being honest!"
2,Ludie's Song,I thought that this was a good book of a white girl and her forbidden friend ship with a black family.
1,Please don't be misled by the devil's lies...,Surely we must be living in the end times. I agree with the majority of reviewers who cannot believe the blasphemy and gall of the writers and editors of these immense falsehoods! I am a woman and am offended deeply by this. Jesus Yeshua ben Nazaret was a male historical figure whose existance is also corroborated by outside sources such as the Jewish historian Josephus as well as other texts. Jesus is the God Man. What a false gospel. Unbelievable!!! If you want a good new translation I would suggest the Holman Christian Standard Bible.
1,"Plagiarism? Or just plain blasphemy? Horrible, either way.","If I didn't know any better--specifically if this book didn't carry a 2003 publishing date--I would have assumed that the un-worthies at LBI Institute had cribbed from either (a) the NIV Committee (""Committee on Bible Translation"") or (b) Shane Johnson's /A Form of Godliness/. This cannot empower anyone, for one can derive no legitimate power from lies. When St. Paul told the Galatians that he was positively gawping at the spectacle of their turning to follow a gospel so far off the road that it wasn't the same road (Galatians 1:6), even he would never have thought of this. He would not have merely gawped; he would have had a heart attack. (Or maybe not. He finally told his apprentice, Timothy, that a time would come when men and women would tell one another whatever their itching ears wanted to hear. This would probably have been merely the most shocking example.)"
1,What on earth?,"This is the most rediculous thing I have ever seen. I know people are desperate to identify with something and fit in but come on....Ladies, this kind of stuff is not empowering to us in the least so give it up! Real power is taking what you've got, what is real, and making that into something beautiful despite obsitcles in your way. Not changing everything to some make believe mess because you can't deal with reality. That is nothing but weakness!"
1,Just another athiest attack on Christians,"This is so low a blow, that negative 5 stars would be the correct rating."
1,Oh well....,Knowing that God will judge at the last days....I pray for the reviewers that praise this book and hope they will repent of their wrong. And may God have mercy on the souls who approved this blasphemy to be written.
3,Two Groups,"Not really top notch Hard Bop from mid 1956 Riverside Records - Tracks 1-5 are a quintet with altoist Ernie Henry. Tracks 6-8 are a septet with Kenny Dorham, Frank Foster and Cecil Payne in the front line with Matthew. The little known pianist Joe Knight was the pianist for both sessions. Frank Foster was the strongest voice among all the horns.Bennie Green and Curtis Fuller went on to make all the later trombone led recordings. This one's for die-hards.Gee later became a member of a 1959 12 man Duke Ellington ensemble, writing one of the tunes - The Swingers Get The Blues Too - from the BLUES IN ORBIT album. In 1964 he played sideman to Johnny Griffin on SOUL GROOVE for Atlantic Records."
4,Great Protection,"I just received this case and it is very sturdy and I am positive it will protect my Blackberry. Very easy to install, but I do not like the snaps. While it is great for installation, the snaps are raised and can be uncomfortable when holding the phone. The case is slightly raised to completely protect all parts of the phone, so there is little worry about damage to your phone. Overall I believe this will protect my phone better than a sleeve, but it becomes less sleek in doing so."
5,classic,"if u all never heard this cd you all need to get it, i've had this cd for years but on a bootleg so just ordered the legit copy....this was when cham and paul were tight get ya mind correct is also hard."
5,Fun reading,"My three children have all loved this book. It's time to buy a new one as the 7 year old version has shown wear and tear over the years. It's imaginative, fun and lets the children make the characters actually move. One of the best interactive books I've seen!"
3,About what I expected,"I became a huge Paul Rodgers fan because of Bad Company and I had never owned this CD until now because I was not please with Bad Company's direction. It seemed each album was worse than the previous. I still feel that way but having recently purchased all of Free's catalog and keeping up with Paul's solo career this was the only cd I did not own. Electicland is a great song but all-in-all the album is just okay.If you're a big Bad Company fan and don't own it yet, go ahead. If you like Bad Company and don't own any Free albums, get them instead. A note about Free, their earlier albums are bluesy and as they progressed you can start to hear the early Bad Company sound coming through."
1,Don't waste your money on a kiddie camera,"We just bought this camera to replace our miniDV JVC-DVL500 that was bought in 2000.In short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is VERY grainy and dark. I applied the workaround listed above, but found that I had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that I needed which caused a VERY jittery image.The quality of this camera is something that I would expect for $200, needless to say I am returning this camera today!"
5,Must Have Christmas Album,"This was such a wonderful album- from the very first song, it puts you right in the Christmas mood! Very cheery and festive, it's perfect for cold days and twinkly Christmas tree lights. All the songs are beautifully harmonized, and great to sing-along to. The album contains some songs you don't really hear at Christmas anymore- Here We Come A-Caroling, Go Tell it on the Mountain, O Tannenbaum- was thrilled to hear their version of it. Excellent album- I could kick myself for not getting this before- very highly recommended!"
3,I do love Ray Conniff for Christmas but....,"this album/cd was different than the previous ones. The arrangement I believe is the difference. That said, I want to say that this was the first time I had heard these songs. I grew up listening to the first two and loved them so maybe I was just used to the musical arrangement. I still wanted to purchase this cd because I was so sure I would love it too and I might if I keep listening to it as I have the other two."
2,Somewhat disappointed,At first I was eager to order this CD as a replacement for the original one with the same title. This copy does not have all of the original songs on it and for that reason I was disappointed. I guess they thought they would separate the songs and make two CD's thus making more money than having all of the original songs included. The quality is very good - it's just that many of the medleys and songs that I liked on the original were cut from this release.
2,Alan Moore's laziest work,"I know I will get negative votes for this review but I have to be honest. I thought that the name Alan Moore in the cover of anything was the guarantee of a good story, but this magazine proved me wrong. I call it a magazine and not a book or graphic novel because the story is only 24 pages long and consists of three much shorter independent stories, merely snapshots. The stories are lazy (Mr. Moore didnt try hard enough this time), they are supposed to be erotica, but I found them nearer to drama than anything else, and now to the worst part: the art, very childish, very amateurish, hardly evoking any emotion at all. I will read The League of Extraoduinary Gentlemen tonight because I need to forgive Alan Moore."
2,"Hi, my name is rust.","I liked this a lot. Until it started to rust. Constantly. No matter what I tried to use to keep it (from food-grade wax to mineral oils) it still developed rust spots.It is very heavy, works great for grinding up just about anything, just expect a little extra iron in your diet after a couple months unless perhaps you live in a desert.I gave up on it and started using coffee grinder as a spice mill instead."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I was interested in this product in to look for a resistance system that was both graduated and functionally useful. The bands are graduated in resistance but not for someone with a neurological deficit trying to strengthen their hand. It begins at a much higher level than appropriate for someone with an injured hand. It may be good for athletes but as a physician is not recommended for someone with a hand or nerve injury.
3,After a month of use...,"Bought these for something to play with while working at the computer, which I will say- they are great for.Unfortunately, after about a month of use (maybe 15 minutes 3-4 times a week) the blue bands broke. Didn't expect it, but now all I have is the reds (highest strength.)It's fine for me, but the rest are kind of useless. Which was my initial disappointment with the product. If you're hands/wrists are weak the lower level bands are probably useful but otherwise, you're only paying for about 4 bands (2 strengths.) And considering the stress they took, I don't how long these will last.Purchase at your own discretion."
1,A poor quality product,"This set of earphones is worst than the original set that came with my MP3 player. The music is flat, there is absolutely no dynamic to what you hear. The noise canceling is a joke. When you turn it on, you actually hear a low level hum! I will not recommend it, you are better off spending a little extra money to get a better set of earphones."
1,Poor Quality,"These by far are the worst earphones I've ever purchased. They don't stay in your ears, require constant adjusting and the quality stinks! Save your money and purchase something different."
1,Absolute trash,"My wife bought this at the airport, thinking that it's size and ""Noise cancellation"" is a good purchase. She didn't like it and I tried it on my next trip.1 The so-called ""remote"" is bulky. The wire running from it to the music player is way too short. I had to hold it in my hand. I have full size Noise cancelling earphones that fold up which works far superior on a plane.2 The sound is tinny and very low volume. Noise cancellation is at a minimum if at all effective.3 I lost the soft in ear part of one earbud, which falls off often. I called COBY and was told that they don't sell a replacement part and that I might be able to find a suitable paert at ""Radio Shack"" or some other electronics store.4 Very poor support from COBY!"
3,"Not deep, but it is fun",Under The Skin is a quirky game. You play as an alien who usually tries from people in the levels by using certain tools and abilities. There are a variety of different levels ranging from Raccoon City to a casino level. The graphics aren't bad and the music is nice. The problem is that the objectives are not diverse enough. The challenge usually is to get a certain number of coins before an opponent does. This is a fun game but could be much funner if the objectives were more varied.
5,Search for Happiness,"This was an excellent read, very helpful for spiritual growth, one of the best in a long time."
5,"Great book, thinking book!","Great book to understand the ways we seek and find our happiness in both a spiritual sense and within the context of our ""living"" in the world around use. The four levels are easy to understand and the concepts are easy to grasp. Fr Oscar has wirtten many book in helping people define theology in a modern and simple way, while holding the ideals and the rationale up, and without an apology for beleif in something which is greater. This exposition on the four ""levels"" of happiness covers both the ideal and the antithesis in what we strive for while alive, and what we should avoid to stay happy."
1,laziness,"All this CD contains are the tracks from two ""B"" rated Lp's from the 60's that were issued on the Standard label. There was no thought or attepmt to show the depth of recorded material by Vasilis Saleas.Beware of records on this label. The head of this company does nothing more than issues totally inferior products."
1,Sloppy,"1039/Smoothed Out, Slappy Hours, the name is even bad. This album is full of sloppy guitar and the same drum beats time after time, and almost every song they sing about love. If you can agree I think we have heard enough love songs for awhile, This album is really just sloppy and contains lame guitar solo and horrible drum beats, I mean the cover is even stupid it shows some goth girl standing by some trees. What the heck's the meaning of that? Don't waste your money on this and instead if you want good punk get Ramones first album or Never Mind The Bollocks by the Sex Pistols."
4,Green Day Forever,"This is a pretty good CD. it does not compare to their older stuff, but it has some good songs. You can hear some of the same guitar lines that are used on Insomniac, as well. Knowledge is an interesting little song by Operation Ivy. For those of you who don't know Op. IV, it is a good chance to check them out. If you liked Warning, you may not like this CD, but it is good overall. For the die hard Green Day fan like me, it is a must, but a casual fan might want to buy Nimrod instead."
3,"2 good guys, one bad","The songwriting and guitar parts are really great. I love the rough edge on the recording, and the pop-punk sound. However, the drummer they had before Tre was truly awfull. He can't even keep time, and his fills hurt my ears. Anyway, while he is bad, he still can't ruin a pretty good album."
4,Green Day's Great Beginning!!,"I thought this was a great cd from my longtime and all time favorite band of 10 years. This cd was a great start in Green Day's career, because it wasn't chart topping, and it wasn't a bomb. My favorite songs on this album are At the Library,Going to Pasalacqua,16,The Judge's Daughter,409 in Your Coffee maker, Dry Ice, and I Want to Be Alone. That may seem like all of the songs, but to tell you the truth, i loved all of the songs! Those were just the ones that stood out to me most. I have the original recordings of 39/Smooth and the rest of the EP's and LP's, and the first recording of 1039/Smoothed out slappy hours, but this one was enhanced with extra footage, and the recording was enhanced as well, so i HAD to go get this as well. But it was worth it, because this CD is AMAZING! Green Day was way ahead of the pack then, and still is now!!!!!!!!"
3,Protein bars,"I've really liked these when I've purchased them locally. Unfortunately, the last 3 times I've ordered them online they have arrived in a ""previously melted"" state. You can tell that the chocolate coating had melted at some point and then resolidified. I thought perhaps it was because it was in the summer, but it happened again with my September order. They were still tasty & a good way to get protein, but not as good as they could be."
4,Tasty,Tastes good and has high amount of protein compared to the other bars. The only complaint is that after I ate these through the week my throat started to swell up after finishing one. I guess I developed some sort of allergy to them. I am trying another flavor now to see if it was just the Peanuts or something else in the bar.Over all it's a good buy considering they are double the price at a grocery store or health food store.
2,Sugar Alcohol caused me gastric problems,"On first glance, 31 grams of protein is great, plus sugar alcohols are noted by some to be better than sugars so it seems like a good deal. I started eating it for breakfast before going to work and noticed my stomach just going nuts, I thought it was the creatine or something but after experimenting with other breakfasts (where I was totally fine) I came back to this and back to having a bad stomach (gas in particular, very uncomfortable). Online, I have found other users report the same things using sugar alcohols, so think before you purchase, and if you have a sensitive stomach, consider steering clear"
2,be careful with what you get,I bought these bars thinking that they were worth 32 g of protein per bar. Turns out that they were only 20 g of protein per bar. Now I understand why it was so cheap. So don't assume what you see in the picture is what you will get.
3,"Healthy & good value, BUT.....","My adult daughter is on a high protein diet, so she recommended these Pure Protein bars to me. At first, I liked them, but to be completely honest, they remind me of that old TV commercial where the little boy gives his dog a spoonful of peanut butter. The poor dog struggles to get his tongue off the roof of his mouth. That's how I feel when I'm eating these bars. I think I'll go back to ordering my Triple Threat Powerbars."
2,Taste the sugar alcohol,"I tried most of the Pure Protein bars and don't find any of them appealing, but this one is at least better than the others.The main problem is how they make these bars. The top layer is always the flavoring. For s'mores, its like this sweet, creamy (almost oily) filling. It doesnt really taste like s'mores, just sugar. The bottom layer is where all the protein and sugar alcohol is, and that part by itself is disgusting to chew.Now the idea is these 2 layers will mix in your mouth and you'll get an ok taste... but that never happens. The top layer dissolves almost instantly, while you're stuck chewing the bottom layer for far too long. The first few bites are extremely sweet, but as you try to chew down the bottom layer, you start tasting that bitter sugar alcohol. People who claim these taste ""good"" either have damaged taste buds, or they swallow the bottom layer.They would be better off just mixing the whole thing together."
1,Not fresh,"I bought the strawberry shortcake flavor and would not recommend buying it from Amazon. The top layer of strawberry flavor is ok, but there's only a little hint of strawberry. The 'cake' part is just nasty (unfortunately that's 80% of the bar). The only description I have for it is inedible. The package I received has an expiration date of Sept 2011 so technically it should be fresh. But there is no way these bars are suppose to taste like this. No would ever buy them. I'm going to get some from the local store to see. But I think Amazon must have stored these in really improper conditions. I find a lot of food products from Amazon are not fresh, despite the expiration date, due to storage. Tried a few bars to make sure it wasn't just one bad apple, and tossed it all in the trash."
1,Strawberry Shortcake Flavor,"I normally get the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor, and have always loved it. I thought I'd try the Strawberry Shortcake this time. BIG MISTAKE! That thing is disgusting, and tastes like medicine. Don't do it!!!"
2,Summertime problem???,"I'm afraid I must give a fairly low review to this item. It arrived timely, but every bar was melted to the point that the ingredients were totally unrecognizable. I have bought these before in retail stores, also, so I can compare the flavor. Even if you can get past the disgusting melted mess of these bars, the flavor appears to have degenerated as a result of the melting.It's interesting to note that I have purchased other Pure Protein bars this summer through Amazon and have not had this problem. It appears to be a problem with this particular bar selection or with the retailer.Also, note that I live in Northern Michigan. The issue was not with weather at this end. I don't remember where these were to ship from."
3,So far the worse of the series,I really did have a hard time to read this book. The writing stile of Murgen is kind of difficult and the book keeps shifting back and forward in space and time. Very difficult to keep the time line and understand what's going on.I usually stay up at night to finish this kind of books. This time I had to make an effort not to burn it..
1,Terrible,"You will be disappointed. A lot of the books has the main character reliving the past. Most of this is useless and uninteresting. When I read a sequel, I want to see the story move forward."
2,A lot of cage for the money but not great quality,"The Xtreme cages are very well priced given the size, and the design is pretty good, but the construction is fairly mediocre. The food bowl holders are flimsy and ours arrived all bent up. The bowls themselves are lightweight plastic. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that the main panels are attached together with just a few easily accessible (and easily removable) bolts with nuts, so if your bird is at all mechanically inclined, you might come home and find your bird buried under a pile of disassembled cage pieces. We use ours as vacation cages, but wouldn't use them as primary cage."
3,Writers and Their Milieu Recalled Well,"Cronin gives the reader an enjoyable, sometimes amusing, portrayal of three of of Ireland's greatest modern writers: Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and Flann O'Brien. His descriptions of pre-fame Brendan Behan are excellent. They show the young and adventurous Behan as he was before fame, drink, and self-parody overtook him. It was somewhat disappointing that Flann O'Brien, author of skilled and imaginative works (At-Swim-Two-Birds, The Third Policeman) was himself an alcoholic with, nonetheless, a bourgeois, sometimes puritanical personality. All these writers (and others everywhere)tended to be petty, egoistic, and hyper-critical, especially about their contemporaries' work. But this does not make them uninteresting, and one should always separate art from artist."
3,don't know much about geology...,"This is a well-written book that initally appears to be meant for a general audience, but in fact it would be best for those who already have a working knowledge of geology. Unfortunately, McPhee uses geologic terms without defining them. For casual readers without a background in the field, a glossary would have helped a great deal."
2,Should have paid attention to review dates...,"This guide is ancient. But, it's cheap and a decent source of information. My ""Learning Linux"" book published in 1996 from QUE still has a ton of relevant information, and it's going on fifteen years old. (Linux turns 20 this year, I believe).So, if you need a Linux guide, there's probably better (and newer ones) than this.I'm taking my Red Hat certification in a couple weeks and was looking for a quick ""cram"" guide to fill in some of the minor things that I might overlook.If you are going to be taking a red hat certification exam in the near future, there's better guides than this to prepare you for the exam.2/5 stars because much of the information is still relevant, and I should have paid more attention to the dates the other reviews were posted."
1,"I already made a review and you deleted it, here you have it again",I recived a damaged battery and they want me to pay for the return (it cost me more than what the battery worth): bad quality and worst service. Not recommended
2,Meh... not so great.,"It does lengthen lashes, but it's not for me. I'd rather use my cheap great lash mascara for three times the definition and length."
4,Razor A3,"I purchased this for my 6 1/2 year old son. Overall, the product is quite sturdy and robust and the finish is excellent. However, the wheelie-bar seems come in the way of the brake."
5,Green,"I had the original A1 Scooter for a few years, a while back I came home and found it ripped in half! I had been without a scooter for a few years and decided to buy a new one. The A3 is a great improvement on the other Razors, it's handel bars are much higher than the A1, high enough to perfectly fit a five foot five inch teenager like myself, I ordered a green one from this page and it came exactly when it was estimated for delivery. The weight resrictions I don't beleive are acurate, I way several pounds more than the recomended weight and can ride it just a well as my 11 year old neighbor. It is important to hose of and theroughly dry this scooter after every use (if you want to keep it looking new) the weels atract dirt and dust very easily.~BD"
3,"At first no, then re-reading it made sense","I had to keep flipping back to remember what this page was referrencing, as it jumped around a good bit. The information was badly put together, I wish it had a more coherent form - it seems like really interesting information -But if you use it with research, and referrence the index to find your subject, then this book works well. It seems to be a notation essay, and less than a book. But - the information is sound... And thus, I am attached to my copy."
1,Bad Translation,"I give it one star simply because of the translation. For example, ""la casa de Rosa"" becomes in English ""the house of Rosa"" instead of ""Rosa's house."" The sloppiest, junior high school errors I've ever had the displeasure to read. And the demigod Gutierrez would likely be (probably is) extremely disappointed to learn that an awful translation makes this book entirely unbearable to read. The translator of Tropical Animal, whoever he is, brutalizes Gutierrez's work. It plods, stumbles, and staggers along with no clear appreciation for either English or the book's original Spanish. Just horrendous.Don't be deterred by this - try picking up Dirty Havana Trilogy translated by Natasha Wimmer, and you'll see the difference."
5,Test Strips,Test Strips are very expensive. That being said the fact that these shipped without an additional cost was absolutely essential to making this the best deal at the time.
4,Reality Isn't What It Used To Be isn't what it used to be,"An excellent exploration of the meaning, possibilities, and problems of postmodernism, free from jargon and caricature. My only complaint: Isn't it time for a new edition? The book was published in 1995, meaning it was probably actually written in the early 90s or even late 80s. Most of its examples from ""current events"" and pop culture are of 1980s vintage or even earlier. Many of these examples would themselves require explanation for people younger than, say, dirt.I assume that the author was pretty old even then, so he might be dead or retired now. But the topic is still relevant, and this is an excellent introduction to it. We need an update. For example, what has been the impact of 9/11 and related events on postmodern culture and thought? Or the coming ecological meltdown that was mere conjecture in 1995, but is an imminent certainty now?"
2,Blues Masters,"I was very disappointed by the mistreatment of these great masters by the producers of the DVD. Why people constantly feel they have to be interjected into history electronically is beyond me. The idea of this DVD is that a production company got a hold of what I believe to be some of the finest quality footage of such greats as Sonny Terry, Otis Span & Muddy Waters, and my problem is the amateurish treatment given to them in the presentation. The host Collin James is interspersed in between the clips sometimes talking over the musical intos and physically inters cutting his flat singing self into a ""Crazy For My Baby"" segment with Willie Dixon. To own some of the clips die-hard blues fans my want to drop the funds to buy this keep this review in mind and you wont be as disappointed as I was. Next time just put the clips on a DVD and put it out."
2,except for the gimmicks...,"Outstanding peformances, good quality sound, but as the previous reviewer noted, the electronic gimmicktry really detracts from the effect, too bad."
3,STARMANIA LIVE suffers from poor recording,"While this version of STARMANIA features some of the show's original and best known renditions and performers of its material, the audience reactions and vocal flaws inhherent in a live recording plague this recording from beginning to end.It is interesting though to listen and hear the difference in the way a French and American audience reacts to a live performance."
3,it's alright.,Not much to say about this book and the recipes are very old from their family. They talk more about their family history then about the food.
4,Great Collection,A very good collection of live performances but not as good as catching the flow of a total concert.
5,Elvis,Everyone that loves Elvis. This is a good one. Amazon has amazing selections to choose from. I loved not having to hunt beyond Amazon to build my collecton on Elvis cds.
5,"Ahh, the early days of Billie Mike & Tre","This cd is from the early days of Green Day, when they were on Lookout Records. There are good punk songs like 2000 Lightyears Away(when I saw Green Day live they had a saxophone solo during this song), One for the Razorbacks, 80, One of My Lies, and Sweet Children, plus there's the hillarious Dominated Love Slave, the original version of Welcome to Paradise, and a cover of The Who's ""My Generation"". Pick this up if you're a fan, and if you havent seen Green Day live yet, GET TICKETS if you ever have the chance! Believe me, you haven't lived till you've gone to a Green Day concert!"
5,Green Day's most creative album,"I thought that this cd was the best one that Green Day has released. Though i like all of their music, i thought this one shows the most creativity. Songs like ""who wrote holden caufield"" and ""words i might have ate"" show their ability to express thier emotions through music as well as their talent in music/song writing. I recommend this cd for someone who hasnt heard much of Green Day because it shows both their quiet side in songs like ""christy road"" and ""no one knows"" while still retaining their classic punk quality."
1,Why do people think it's so great!,"I think a few of the songs on here. The rest of the album I think stinks!! I don't know why people find it so great. Their most recent 3 (Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod) were excellent. I'm a big Green Day fan. I just don't like this one."
5,Kerplunk is Green Day kerPUNK!,"Green Day's second and final album with Lookout! Records, and much better quality than the first album off the Lookout! label (more funding went into this one). Includes first recording of the punk rock trio's hit 'Welcome To Paradise'. 'Christie Road' is a slower paced song about a place to escape to, much in the theme of the young Green Day. 'Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?', a song based on the main character in the classic book 'Catcher In The Rye' by J.D. Salinger, and The Monkees inspired 'Words I Might Have Ate' closes the album before the 4-track recording of the very early Green Day, Sweet Children. These and many more Green Day material make up the Kerplunk collection, which seem to be very much inspired by singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong's early musical interests. A fantastic Green Day album if you're into them, 'Kerplunk' has many punk-pop tunes that should keep you entertained until they release something new!"
5,Their second is one of their best!,"I absolutely love 'Kerplunk.' It's one of Green Day's finest. Their second record is one of their best records. This was released in 1992 on the Lookout Records label. They would sign to Reprise Records one year later (1993).This album has a string of highlights. The original 'Welcome To Paradise,' 'Sweet Children,' '2000 Light Years Away,' 'My Generation' and the funny 'Dominated Love Slave' are all highlights on one of Green Day's finest.Unfortunately, this record seems to be overlooked. And that's a shame, because it's great to hear the group before they had their success with 1994's 'Dookie.'So if you like Green Day even a little bit, do check this record out. It's one of my favorites from them, and you'll be satisfied.Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!"
5,"Halfway between 1,039 and Dookie","This is not Green Day's best album- that honor goes either to Dookie or American Idiot. But Kerplunk has a number of their best songs on it: ""2000 Light Years Away"", ""One For The Razorbacks"", ""Christie Road"", and ""Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?"", most notably. Also, the growth both lyrically and sonically between this and the 1,039 compilation is more impressive every time I listen to it. I just wish the band would play some of these songs live every now and then."
4,NO FIVE STARS BUT STILL GREAT,THIS ALBUM IS VERY GOOD AND CONTAINS SOME COOL SONGS. THIS ALBUM CAME OUT BEFORE GREEN DAY BECAME THE HUGE BAND THAT THEY ARE TODAY. ANYWAY STILL A GOOD ALBUM.
5,Excellent Hanja Reference,"This book was given to me while I was studying Korean at the Defense Language Institute. The format of the book is pretty straight forward: count the number of strokes in the character and start searching. Although its obvious that ""hanja"" plays a diminishing role in ""survival korean"", it can provide useful insight into meanings of more complex words. Be sure you've learned ""hangul"" before you consider adding this book to your library. With a bit of study, you'll find that you'll be able to learn more ""hanja"" than the average Korean knows. I know I have."
3,For hanja learners only,"This is like a hanja dictionary. If you want to learn hangul, don't buy this.Note: Hanja is like chinese characters, But the koreans borrow them. Also called Sino-Korean Charachters"
1,Not as advertised.,"I ordered the teacher kit and received six plastic calculator cases, each able to hold 10 calculators. There was no kit. The description states the kit includes calculators, a case and teaching tools for the calculators in english and spanish. I returned the kit and received a refund without any problems. The company was very responsive and helpful in the return process, however they did not address the issue that I never received the item as described or if they even carry that item."
1,hour mag,I am have nothing to add not sure if it Amazon or the Mag I purchased in July now Sept have not recieved one issue yet.So it is a no buy if want it soon next step amazon customer service.
5,Test Drive 6 rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Test Drive 6 is an awesome game. I would give it six stars but you can only put 5 max. There are 26 different tracks and over 35 different cars. The tracks are awesome with cars to get in your way and police men who are waiting to pull you over. It is one big career mode where you get money for winning single races or tournaments. There is also a cop mode where you try to pull over racers and get money if you do. There is also a practice mode to sharpen your driving skills. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes simulation racing games.
1,A big disappointment after TD5,"If this is a simulation, it's about bowling, where the ball is shaped as a sport car and the pins are taxis. Test Drive 5 had a nice touch to it, about halfway between a simulation and an arcade game, but this one is so 'arcadeish' it's very frustrating for a simulation fan like me. Get a ""Need For Speed - Porsche"" game instead, if you like driving simulators."
3,"Entertaining, but feather weight","I bought this mostly for Kristin Chenowith, but I liked the sound bites available to sample. The music is entertaining, but forgettable. It's OK, but not really a ""must have."""
3,TITLE IS MISLEADING,"Quite honestly I cant really rate this book. I mistakenly bought this book based solely on the title and author's reputation.I thought, from the title, that this book actually contained the Kalevala and also some other epics. It does not.What it is, is a collection of writings/discourses/papers on the Kalevala and others. It is ""textualisation"" and ""comparative research on epics"".Here are some examples of the various paper titles:KALEVALA TRADITION AMONG FINNISH-AMERICANS; VALUES, COMMUNITYAND HERITAGE.EPIC WORKS OF THE SETU SINGER ANNE VAGARNATHE BULGARIAN FOLK EPIC TRADITION AS AN EXPRESSION OF NATIONALIDENTITYCONSTRAINTS ON HISTORICITY IN THE BOOK OF KINGS.I think you get the idea. I love reading all the ancient and medival prose and poetry but this book was beyond me (even with a college education).Maybe when I have studied epic poetry for more years, I will be ready for this book."
3,small and compact,it looks really well it is small and the portable issue is very good but due to that the sacreen is very small and its settings screen could really be improved.
1,It never worked,"My wife and I bought the F33P as a gift for her dad at Christmas. He didn't open it until our fishing trip in July. Despite all attempts, the unit would never turn on. Since we didn't register it within two weeks of purchase, Hawkeye would not replace it. Total junk."
4,This is an awsome sonar,"I have only had the oppertunity to test this item for ice fishing, but from what i have seen its awsome.The see thru ICE option is incredible and very impressive.A little bit of water on the ice from a cup or bottle and your looking straight thru 3 feet of ice at the fish.Very nice size,portable.The sonar cable plugs in to the unit extremely hard so once its plugged in leave it there.Only complaint is that any large object on the bottom shows up as 3 diff sixe rocks,small/medium/Large,even if its a junked car,lol,shows as a Rock,or a tree trunk snag shows as a rock.Other then that i give it a 5 but for crappy bottom imagery i give it 4 out of 5"
5,excellent product,"After receiving the fish finder I wanted to test it out in my swimming pool. Well the readings were erratic and didn't make sense, so I thought it was a bad unit. A call to customer service got me right through to a rep and he explained that the unit will not work properly in a pool. He said in fact, that it was a good sign I was getting those readings because it showed the unit was working. Sure enough, the next time I used it was on the water where it worked perfectly. Great US customer service from this company."
4,good for the price,"Bought this for use on my kayak. Works awesome as a depth finder. It's not a high end model but for the price, it's hard to beat. I recommend getting some rechargeable batteries for it too. I do wish the cord was not so long though."
4,NORCROSS FISH FINDER,"IT WORKS OK, ALITTLE HARD TO READ THE DEPTH OF THE FISH ON THE SCALE. NICE FROM SHORE LETTING YOU KNOW IF THESE ANY FISH IN THE AREA. HAD USED IT 3 TIMES. WOULD RECOMMEND IT."
3,Norcross Hawkeye F33P Fish Finder,i purchased this fish finder for use on shore and i would not recommend it to any one for this reason absolutely horrible. the sensor that you throw out goes 35ft and the line sinks so they tell you on the package to purchase seperate float attachment. side scanning is ok but then you dont know if the fish are high or low in the water. However from my boat it works great it can shoot the the hull on some boats and ice when ice fishing which is a very good feature. so if your looking for a fish finder for ice or your boat then maybe consider this one but from the shore dont waste your money cause mine stay in my cabinet not my tackle box
2,The usual.,"Anna Faris looks great, but this movie is just a run of the mill crapfest and very predictable. To bad she got connected to such a BAD FILM."
3,"Fun time, dialogue and some great comedic timing","Watched on 42"" Plasma, with BD35 Player. The film has a crisp transfer, and is definitely a worthwhile BD purchase, if you like the movie.I rented it, and although it is not the typical movie I like, it did make me laugh and the actresses in it, had some great comedic timing. The story imparts all kinds of ""messages"", and is a fun time, with goofy dialogue. It has a cool soundtrack,with contemporary music, and is a fun ""chick"" flick. Watch it for what it is, and you'll have a good time!"
2,And so on and so forh,"This film had all the elements needed for a good comedy or a sexy comedy. In the end, it produced neither. As a sexy comedy, very little happened that was really sexy. The star, Anna Faris, is very attractive, very hot. But it's one thing to see someone like her in the mall and want to ask them out, and another to have them 'carry a film'. Ms. Faris is shapely, sexy, and not unfunny, but as to a full film, forget it. Christina Applegate in her prime or Jennifer Aniston perhaps, but not Ms Faris."
2,not worth the money,The dispensor is ok but the clock stopped working shortly after I started using it. Was disapointed in that. Easy to fill and use
2,Why do they cheap out on the clasp?,"These would be 5-star earrings if they only gave a few more millimeters of length to the prong part of the clasp. Yes, they're hard to close... but the problem is that the clasp doesn't stay closed. The prong is just too short to stay in the hoop. About twice a week, I wake up and find an earring missing because it opened and came off while I slept. I've had them come off while toweling my hair, too.Blomdahl people... do you read these? PLEASE LENGTHEN THE PRONG.Otherwise, these are great."
3,Comfortable but hard to close at first,"I am super sensitive to nickel and have not worn earrings in years. I can wear these earrings in comfort! At first I had a very difficult time getting them to close (I had to recruit my husband for help), but after day 1 I have found them to be trouble-free."
3,good work but typos?? hurt,"This is a beautifully produced book with hundreds of color plates. There are many areas barely touched upon, but this is not a deep work, just one meant to acquaint people with Medieval times and possibly lure to a more in depth study. But since this is an ""encyclopedia"", I ask did you ever get in depth works there? They are merely the start of a journey. If you think along those lines you will have a clear view of how this books works and serves. So approach it as that and you will be pleased.It is merely a starting point. Some inaccurate information, so beware to double check sources when using information. Not sure if the errors were done in actual research (hard to believe of a Rhodes Scholar) or just typos. Either way, in a work such as this they really hurt the credibility."
2,much smaller than it appears,"ummmm, yea, there is no way three kids can really play on this at the same time...I wish this were bigger...I don't think it will last past my daughters 3rd birthday."
4,Fun for both indoor or outdoor activity,Good for developing climbing skills. Fun indoors now that it's winter time but will eventually move outside. Very good quality; very durable; very easy to assemble. Very safe. My 15M old loves it.
2,keep researching,"After researching myself and all the good reviews this slide had gotten, I decided to purchase one for my 1 1/2 year old daughter. First of all, like some of the reviews said, this was a hassle to put together. What I didn't consider, until owning one, the grooves on the platform always have water in them from being outside, whether rain or sprinklers. So if outdoors be prepared to be wiping or tilting before each use. Another thing to keep in mind... I was concerned with the height of the slide, so I choose to go with the short one, only now my daughter's weeeeeeee,s, are more like we. I wish I opted for a longer slide."
1,Don't Be Deceived! This is Dangerous!!!,"This toy is deceptively dangerous! My son and the neighborhood kids love it, but the rear green ledge from which the kids access the slide is very, very narrow, notwithstanding what the photos depict. Even with parental supervision, my son has fallen backwards 3x, once seriously, as well have the other children in the neighborhood. [...]"
3,If it fits,"I bought this for my 20 month old daughter. The assembly is easy, but unfortunately I had to return it 2X to find a unit that was not defective.(assembly units have problems fitting together). Once I had it together, it was great. My daughter loves to climb, crawl(which she hates doing!), and ride down the slide all day long. My daughter is on the tall side of her age and the slide is rather short. Besides these little points, it was a good buy."
4,Big Brown Bear (Green Light Readers),"This is a great beginning book. Ny first grader really enjoyed it. He was able to manage most of the words in the book, yet it was not too easy. He thought it was funny and enjoyed predicting what the bear would do next. He summed it up at the end by saying ""this book was really cool!"""
4,Ain't no Comparison...,"Due to the current condition of hip-hop with so many watered-down music and lyrics, this album without a doubt shines. At least some cats come through with REAL hip-hop still. Buckshot has always been hard, and 9th Wonder continues to impress me with his beats.Dope album."
3,CHEMISTRY,"I GIVE THIS LP 3.5 MICS...I THINK BUCK AND 9TH BOTH COULDA HAVE DONE BETTER...I EXPECTED THE LP TO BE A CLASSIC, YA KNOW, DOPE BEATS WITH DOPE LYRICS, BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT THAT WAY FOR ME DOE...OVER ALL IT'S A LP WORTH TO BUY IT...I JUST HOPE THE NEXT TIME WILL MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE.PEACE"
5,Classic,Another childhood classic. You have to watch this at least once every Christmas. It's a family tradition for me that will continue for years to come.
3,"Amazing picture, but seems some parts of the songs are missing","The picture quality is amazing, however, I noticed there's at least one thing missing: right before the end credits, the ""oooo"" vocals are missing. That's the first time I've ever bought it on DVD/Blu Ray, so I didn't know if that was the case with the earlier DVD editions as well? I might go look for those one day..."
5,The best Grinch ever...,"Fun to watch, but very short, in case you are not familiar with that movie. Little kids are not scared of this Grinch....."
5,A Great Christmas Tale,"The story about Whoville and the Grinch is a wonderful Christmas Tale. Everyone else has talked about the songs, Max and, of course, Cindy Lou Who. However, the story is also one of true Christmas sentiments. There is redemption, changing of the Grinch's heart, and the indomitable spirit of all of the Who's and their recognition that even without the Roast Beast and the toys, Christmas is still Christmas. What a clear and gentle message. (And how much fun, too!)"
4,Classic Christmas,"Christmas isn't Christmas without the Grinch! I grew up watching this Christmas classic and now I'm introducing my 2 year old nephew to Whoville. I have a collection of movies and television shows on video and have been replacing them with DVDs so the Grinch is a welcome addition. The Grinch movie was OK but will never replace Boris Karloff singing ""You're a mean one, Mister Grinch""! Thanks Amazon!"
5,"Christmas joy for Whos, young and old","The colors are beautiful, the sound is better than I remember as a child, and it includes ""Horton Hears a Who."" Who could ask for anything more? Plus there's a nice smattering of special features and background information about how the original was made. Thank you!!!"
5,grinch,"i love to collect classic movies, and this is certainly one of them.it is difficult to find classics in blu ray"
4,This is a book about human evolution and spirit involution.,"This is a book about human evolution and spirit involution. Wilber painstakenly reviews the stages of growth from the Pleromatic stages up through the Subtle, Causal then finally Non-dual. The Atman Project is regarded as one of the core which upon which Wilber's later and more complex books are based. This is an outstanding work and now my second favorite Wilber book after Eye to Eye."
1,Cult of Greed strikes again,"The ""Board of Directors"" of the new Cult Awareness Network are Scientologists. Don't let them fool you into thinking this book is anything other than an excuse for their own existance. It preaches acceptance and tolerance under the guise of religious freedom. If you want to read what cults are really about, do a search for Steve Hassan or Margaret Thaler Singer.Avoid this book!"
4,"Good tunes, little info","This 1993 release from King Blues offers 12 recordings of Albert King, ranging from OK to excellent. It is obvious that this is a compilation of several sessions. Some tracks have his guitar up front in the mix, other track have him buried. There are no notes explaining when each song was recorded, or the members of his band.Although the songs on this CD are good, I took away a star for the lack of Liner Notes."
2,"Stop, stop, stop... do not buy!","I have had this vacuum for a little less than a year. It is a great vacuum, when it works. There is a flaw in the wand or switch wiring that causes the vacuum to shut off and stop working requiring parts replacement to fix. It has happened twice in 6 months on my unit. Looking around online I see a lot of people complaining of the exact same problem... touch the wand extension while the vacuum is running and it shorts out requiring warranty service. This is a major flaw and inconvenience for a $300 vacuum. Do not buy unless you want to be constantly dropping it off and picking it up for service. If your intent on buying... at least look around online first, search for user reports on this vacuum and see how many you find complaining of units that mysteriously stop working."
2,Good unless it stops working,"I bought this vacuum last year and yes, it was the vacuum of my dreams. Easy to use and very effective. BUT I made the mistake of leaving it plugged in overnight. I came home from work to find that it had stopped working. I realized that it is not made by Electorlux but by Eureka and got it to the correct repair shop, where it has been for the last 3 months. Seems they are still waiting for a part.What I was told is NOT to leave these plugged in. There is a product defect in the power wand that caused these to short out.Think hard before choosing this vacuum."
1,cheapest vacuum ever!,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would! I bought this vacuum 2 and a half years ago. It has broken twice now. First the electric from the carpet brush to the vacuum stopped working, now the the arm roll broke in half. It has been sitting at the local vacuum store for over a month now waiting for Electrolux to review the warranty claim. Customer service is awful and unhelpful. I never expected such an expensive vacuum to be so cheap!"
3,eh,"Don't know what these overwhelmingly positive reviews are all about, this thing is overpriced and weak on floors.Cons- Extremely weak on hard floors at any suction level, had to use my cordless to pickup a stuff this vacuum left on the floor and redo some areas.- The vacuum and attachment are pretty heavy and bulky, not easy to move and clean areas under furniture and corners. Areas my old Magic Blue handled with ease.Pros- Bagless- Build quality seems good.- Looks aight."
1,Never again will I buy another Electrolux product,"Less than two years ago, I ordered here the Electrolux TwinClean Canister along with the Pronto 2-in-1 cordless stick. A couple months ago, the motor on the stick that drives the beater brush began to malfunction, so that after operating for a few seconds, the beater brush stops rotating and, in my case, pet hair clogs up the head, making the stick useless. I called the authorized service center here in Dallas, where Electrolux is located, and they told me this is common with this machine and cannot be repaired. So that cordless is now useless to us. Today I removed the dust bin on the canister to empty it and when I tried to put it back on, a small plastic clip broke under almost negligible force and now that part will leak air and thus reduce vacuum. When I bought these two machines, I trusted the Electrolux name and what appeared to be thoughtful design, but it's apparent that nice design will be going in the trash before its time."
2,very hyocritical,"This bible is basically good, and very interesting, except for one major flaw. There are many articles and advice columns throughout the book that stress the importance of being a modest young woman, such as dressing conservatively and not calling boys (which I don't really agree with). But the models on the pages of the book are not dressed conservatively at all. Some are in spaghetti strap tanks, halters, and there is even a pic of a girl laying in a guys lap, which is clearly a contradiction of the advice given throughout the book. If I was affected by the pics (and I'm 21) think of how they might affect a 12-16 year old girl who's not yet fully comfortable with her own style? Other than that, the book is good."
5,Excellent!,"When my precious mother died of cancer, this book saved my life. All of my emotions were identified in this book and the way it is written is beautiful. I have read it at least three times and each time I am reminded that my feelings of grief and loss will never completely go away but neither will I allow them to consume me."
2,"Incomplete, shallow and too diverse","If you know nothing about hacking, this book might be a good start. However, there are plenty of web sites that will do a better job (and they are free).The reputation of the authors made me hope for a much more in depth look at hacking techniques. Instead, they touch on most subjects way too lightly, and making several failed attempts in explaining some basic networking concepts.What I thought to be the most value when reading, was the promise of a website with all the links mentioned in the book. As of today, this site is ""under construction"" without any useful information at all! (www.internettradecraft.com)In short, if you want to get a basic feel for what hacking is about, and want to get it without using a webbrowser, read this book. If you're looking to expand your knowledge or get definate answers, look elsewhere."
5,MUST READ,"I Read this book in one day while doing laundry, the poems at the end of each chapter were OFF THE HOOK, i really enjoyed the poem on page 100, truly a page turner, I'am eagerly awaiting for SIS Shahida next book "" CIANNI """
1,refill not good,"I have had trouble with these refills. I've had my braun toothbrush for over 5 years, but find that these Oral-B Precision Clean refill brushes become loose and wobbly after about a month. This happened with my last order also; however I did not remember where I got it. Up to this time I've had no trouble with my toothbrush or the replacement heads."
5,Seven Pillars of Health,Dr. Colbert writes very simply and understandably about how to maintain your health in very practical ways. He has very sensible ways to stay health. His information is timely and very simple to follow.
4,A guilty pleasure,"Natasha has a gift for making catchy tunes but she also takes herself just a little too seriously. At times, this works. The title song is brilliant without being overreaching, and is the shining star on what is a solid album.At the same time, sometimes her lyrics are embarassingly trite, and her mispronunciation of ""hyperbole"" makes one wonder how this could possibly have made it to production without someone saying ""umm, Natasha..."" And she spends too much time writing about the writing process; it's a little self-absorbed.But when we stop looking that closely, it's undeniable that the music is infectious and energizing, and the production is rich and flawless. You can groan about liking it, but you will like it. It's fun. If that's not what you're looking for this isn't the album for you."
2,very average at best= a so-so Taylor Dayne,"her first single just on the beat jacks Mary J.Bliege beats from 92-94&also Bites Lauren Hill Sound circa 1998.vocally she is alright.at the most she reminds me of a So-So Taylor Dayne. she ain't bad,but doesn't really move me that much either. the material I can take or leave on a whole."
3,An Okay Debut,"It was okay. It was a fair debut album, some songs are really good, others are just okay. The first 3 are really cute, but ""Silent Movie"" just doesn't do it for me.Also for clear instructions about getting the songs into iTunes:1. Download the songs onto your computer as .wmas2. Close the program that comes from the CD3. Open Windows Media4. Find the songs in your library5. Burn yourself a CD of those songs6. Insert the burned CD into your CD driveThe songs should open up in iTunes with no problem.** These are the official instructions from Epic, so don't worry that you are doing something illegal."
5,Even better than before!!,"Iced Earth has done it again, another perfect album from the greatest band ever!! fast and furious songs, like dracula and wolf are incredible. Ghost of Freedom is a beatiful ballad, and Damien is epic, controversial, and has very cool vocal lines. Some blind guardian influence is present here."
1,battery cables?,"I expected to be able to just use battery jumper cables and hook this inverter up to the battery in my car. instead, it appears I""m supposed to now loosen the car's own cables, slide the ends of the inverter cables onto them, and then tighten the nuts to secure. I can only guess, as the users manual says absolutely nothing about how to do this. If this is the case, i say this is an inexplicable and most unwelcome hassle. And coleman's web site offers no information whatsover, and their customer service is open from a convenient (for them) nine to five. bah humbug. PS. there's no mention of fuses in the handbook, but there's a bag of them in the box. Great!~"
4,A perfect replacement,This review did not get a 5 star rating only because the price I had to pay.It replaced my broken part perfectly. The light bulbs were all pre-installed and the cable connected plugged right in.It is identical to the original unit.Installation took less than 3 minutes.
1,Broke the first day.,The necklace was pretty but it broke the first day I wore it. The beads started falling everywhere. Had I not been home I would not have been able to recover them all. I was able to use super glue to fix it but I was disappointed at the quality.
3,Worth the rental,I watch this movie every year. It is not the best but I find it entertaining and I like that I can rent it from Amazon.
4,Funny Family Movie,"Very funny, seasonal laughs filled our home as we spilled popcorn doubled over with laughter over this very silly x-mas film. The kids were able to join in on this one as it is family-friendly. Good DVD @ a great price!"
1,Just bad...One of the wore christmas movies ever..John Grisham must be shaking his head,Based on John Grisham's best seller Skipping Christmas which was a really good book comes this train reck of a movie. I am really happy they changed the name from Skipping Christmas (they had to change it becouse of another christmas movie that year was called Survivng Christmas)becouse then it dosent make the novel look so bad. The movie is really bad and I mean bad there are only a few funy moments and all of them where on the trailers. The acting wasent good and the visuals where so fake. The movie it to slap stick and stupid. When this movie was relesed critics trashed it and said it was horriable and they where right. Skip this christmas movie becouse you wont be missing much.
1,Not very funny at all,I have always had fun watching movies with Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. I figured this movie would be very funny with the both of them. I ended up being extremely disappointed. This was not funny at all and seemed to drag on forever. If you have seen the trailer for this movie that was the funniest this movie gets. There is nothing else good in this movie. Take time to buy other great Christmas movies and don't spend Christmas with the Kranks.
1,No Christmas Spirit,"Acting an F. Curtis looks like she gained 10 years. The humor is like that of Home Alone and the neighbors are Christmas terrorists. The ending is the worst part, where a good deed is ruined by a bad comment from one of the neighbors."
5,Christmas gift for freind,"The DVD arrived right on schedule, was brand new and the recipient was extremely happy to recieve and has added it to her collection."
1,Horrid.,"I wasn't at all suprised when ""Film Brian"" did a review of this movie; it's dreadful. The events are predictable, the special effects are bad, the neighbors are Christmas Nazis, the main character is a total douche, the story goes on another half hour after the focus is resolved, it has the shoddy cornball antics that have plagued family comedies the past 10 years, it promotes conformism & marrying a man one has just met, & the movie isn't a fantasy, so the closing seemed inappropriate."
2,Stupid Story Line Sinks Movie,"There are some funny moments in the movie, like when Mrs. Krank chases her holiday ham across the parking lot, or when Tim Allen's ill advised botox treatment affects his eating ability.But this film is sunk by a silly premise. The point of the movie is that the Krank's want to skip Christmas completely when they learn that their daughter will not be home for the holiday (they also want to save money and take a cruise). The neighbors rebel because the Kranks always have the best Christmas party and they are the only ones on the street who have not properly decorated their home in line with the way the others have.But this is stupid and unrealistic. Who has the right to complain and kvetch over how a person does or does not want to celebrate a holiday? Who cares, anyway? Despite some genuinely funny moments from Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, these moments cannot save the film."
4,Christmas with the Kranks,"The movie, starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, is funny and enjoyable to watch. A must have for the holidays. Great family entertainment."
5,Fun movie.,"This is a great movie, its a good light hearted Christmas movie. Im not sure why the world missed this movie, one day its destined to be a true hollywood classic. Its silly fun. Its ok to get away from the hype of blockbusters and see some silly, and silly this one is. I totally recommend."
2,Save your money,Everything in this movie could be told in 30 minutes. It is extremely silly but has a good ending.
1,Would not purchase another DVD.,Quality of DVD is so poor it is not worth watching! I am not sure what is wrong but it looks like old TV.
2,Too pricey for what it does...,"Its a decent product, but not worth its price. It does a decent job of picking up grass clippings etc. Its a little tricky to get the wheels turning properly, but that's just a setup issue."
4,Fine product,This is the second one I have bought. The other is still in working order after over a year. Just wanted a second. Even kids will clean the back yard with one of these.
4,Love This Stuff,"Got hooked on Vanilla coffee via WaWa, but can't get to WaWa everyday... very good flavor for sugar free creamer (powder)..."
4,Delicious-makes coffee taste greTR,It is easy to use. Just shake a little into your black coffee. This creates a delicious drink without making your hot coffee cold! The sugar-free is both low calorie and safe for diabetics when used in moderation. It came quickly from Amazon.com. This product is not so easily found in supermarkets.
2,Not impressed,As soon as I opened the package I was left with the impression that these had been used before. There are scuff marks and scratches all over the item and it seems they have some pretty heavy wear. At least it still cuts right?
2,bad quality,the middle screw fell out after 3 min of use. We have to be careful everytime we use it so it does not fall out. the actual blades came with a weird cloudy coating over the sheers. the curved blade is nice but the overall quality for the price is not good
1,Not As Pictured on Amazon,"I am disappointed because the finger hold side of the 6-1/2in scissors are not as pictured. Why show a picture and ship something else? Is this bait and switch? Now I have to make an effort to return the product. I don't want to encourage this kind of behavior by just accepting what I didn't order. I'll gladly pay more locally and know what I'm getting. Miracle Coat Dog Grooming Shear, 6 1/2-Inch"
3,Go to Spain!,"My own experience studying first from this book, then with an actual teacher, David ""El Poeta"" in Jerez, Spain, is that the latter brought my playing on in leaps and bounds that I would never have achieved with the book alone. The book tries with the best intentions to explain the basic techniques etc. but at the end of the day if you want to learn flamenco you should put some time aside and take a trip to Spain, preferably the south where flamenco originated and continues to flourish. There you can see the flamenco guitar played in its proper context, i.e. accompanying singing and dancing, and this will help to clarify a million little details which are puzzling and frustrating as presented in the book. It's as good a printed introduction to this unique, challenging and passionate way of playing the guitar as any, but be prepared to venture into flamenco territory to really get to grips with this thing called flamenco guitar."
3,Stay away from this vendor,"This vendor will charge you for goods they do not send, then ignore your complaints !! STAY AWAY OR LOSE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"Not a tribute act, just the songs.","I bought this CD figuring that this would be a tribute act where the two performers would perform the songs imitating the voices and personalties of the original stars. I was wrong. Jeff Harnar and Shauna Hicks are perfectly adequate singers and if you would like a CD of the songs identified with Garland and Rooney sung in pleasant if not particularly exciting renditions, this will fill the bill, but Judy and Mickey they ain't."
1,Cheesie sales's man's book of lies..,"He acted like a cheesie sales man of his own book of lies, Than a president of a so called sovereign nation..(Rogue state)..as per state department..This book is not worth of a penny.."
2,Humourous--few interesting facts,"This is the guy who started Kargill--to""FOCUS"" world attention on Kashmir and almost started a nuclear war and had to back out in disgrace--they even refused bodies of Paki soldiers. Truly a total id*ot. No wonder India tipped of his security before his assanination attempt, nothing better than a fool for the enemy. This book tries to potray otherwise. Not a must read for South Asians, but others may benefit to see how delusional the Pakis get."
3,Kargil events described accurately,"Musharraf has corroborated what we had suspected all along: Indians were tactically out-maneuvered in Kargil and suffered a tremendous shock to their self-image. Reading other reviews, it is clear that the petulant Indians are upset about an alternative narrative, a narrative that collides with their fragile egos. With this national psychology, there is no chance of that graceless India will rise above its weak and ineffectual situation."
5,Pakistan,This book is tremendous! Our press certainly did not give coverage of the help we recieved from Pakistan. President Musharraf is dedicated to bringing Pakistan into the 21st century. I started reading it and could barely put it down.I wish our leaders were as dedicated to the welfare of America as President Musharraf isto Pakistan. A true statesman like we need instead of politicans.
3,It's a good effort,"It was exactly how I thought about the General. When you finish the book the only thing you find is that ""I m the best"" which is not the case."
2,diapointed,was brokem right out of the box I have been using it for a year now just zipping it with the oposite side zipper the other was broken.otherwise roomy and I like the front pocket it fits a small DVD player in it.
5,Seriously the best album I've heard this year,"I would consider myself an avid music lover. Some of my favorite bands include classic's such as the clash, sex pistols, the smiths, (i)nc, The Ramones, and newer bands including imarobot, blur, The Strokes, and The Used. I had the privledge of seeing KillRadio perform live at CBGB's recently and I immediately pre-ordered their album. Having just listened to it I can't stress enough how excited I am about this new band. The album starts out with a ton of energy and keeps it 'till the end. As soon as the CD is over you're going to want to listen to it again...and again, and again. not kidding."
2,smell...,I'm a huge fan of Johnson & Johnson lotions and buy just about any variation. Except this one from now on. The lotion probably is good but I just can't get past the fact that it smells like play-doh. That's not exactly the smell I want assailing my senses after a nice hot shower.
2,Disappointed,I was so looking forward to this CD as I have a few recordings of Mischa. I was so disppointed with the performance. Sounds like recording was done while sight reading and rehearsing while trying to keep up with each other. Very little thought was given to the beauty and contrast 4 hands can make of the genius of Mozart's music. Performance was very mechanical with little musicality and zero wit. Tempo was unsteady all over the place....a lot of running. Far cry from Perahia/Lupu duo recordings (which never ceases to amaze me.) This CD collection is going to ebay.
3,Unbelievable,"This is the same product as the other ""Here's Johnny"" set except this one has 1 disc (60 plus minutes) of extra material. It's the same thing and they added the ""Holiday"" moniker because the extra disc is 3 ""holiday"" episodes. This is an insult to buyers of the previous set. If you forked out major bucks for the other set, I just thought you might like to know what you're gettihg here. The Carson dvd treatment has been a major disappointment to say the least. Johnny Carson was a monument to television. It's mind-boggling how this program has not received first class distribution. This is 5 stars for what you get, but I trimmed it for the shabby treament that, overall we're getting."
3,Carson Highlights DVD,"I was pleased with the collection of highlights from the Johnny Carson show. Although there was quite a quantity of stuff to view, I was surprised that it was often divided into content by episode (I guess I expected there would be many ""bits"" as opposed to collections of episodes). Of course I have not yet seen everything in the collection yet, but overall I was pleased."
4,Vintage Carson!,"Got this for my husband after he'd seen the infomercial. Not only a great price on Amazon, but he laughed until he fell off the sofa. Hours and hours of vintage Carson."
5,Good Music good price,My wife ordered this for her sisters birthday. It arrived on time and the music is great.
4,velvety voice,"To me Oleta is the Gladys Knight of the '90's...Same great voice, same problem with material and producers not always up to the audience expectations...This collection includes all the singles off the first 3 albums by Oleta plus a cover of Jimmy Cliff's MANY RIVER TO CROSS (just as good as Cher's)and Elton John's DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME.I fell in love with her voice when i first heard back in 1991 GET HERE - funny thing, ten years on and this is still one of my favourite. It's actually become OUR song for me and Wayne...I JUST HAD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE is so full of hope over a love lost or a long-distance relationship that i easily relate to its themes.WE WILL MEET AGAIN is a lover's promise and LOVER'S HOLIDAY is what all couples plan to do once in a while.You also do get the r'n'b stuff such as CIRCLE OF ONE, WINDOW OF HOPE, but to me ballads is what Oleta delivers best.Get a copy n enjoy it full time!"
4,Exceptionally striking bookazine needs attention!,A new type of publication 'bookazine' does match to what 'Verb' has. What 'Verb' is all about is both conceptual and constructional progress in the field of architecture in recent years. It shows us selected good examples which manage to cope with the state of uncertainty by paying attention to the development of design process. Changing paradigm gives rise to changing type of publication.
2,Earthbound by Richard Matheson,"Not one of my favorite books by Richard Matheson. Not a bad story, but not my type of book."
2,Poor,"About: A visitor to a vacation cabin isn't what she seemsPros: Well written, not very long, big fontCons: Slow, uninteresting, not scary enough horror story.Grade: C-"
1,Don't Bother,"I'm an A1 Richard Matheson fan. but this one is a classic ghost tale gone terribly wrong. Unlike his excellent suspense classic HELL HOUSE, this book starts out promising but ends up being ridiculous. Don't waste time, go straight to I AM LEGEND, THE SHRINKING MAN, or 7 STEPS TO MIDNIGHT for some truly exceptional Matheson mayhem."
1,Brother MFC - 210C actually deserves zero stars!,"I purchased one on sale ($30 off) and was ecstatic over the hype to get 4 functions from one machine. The excitement fizzled as time after time received the ""unable to clean, see troubleshooting""...the kicker is that this occurred during STEP ONE in setup. To make matters worse, the troubleshooting tips on the quick setup and manual said the exact same things and were useless for a setup problem. The onsite troubleshooter FAQs and the email reply from Brother were identical to the other suggestions, again useless! I will never, ever, ever buy anything from Brother. I will stick to HP - which has proven itself over and over."
3,Nice all in one printer-fax-copier-scanner,"But it does have some problems. Just got my printer today, however, using AMD Athlon 2200+, XP, and tested it out. Scanner fails to communicate. The copy quality is streaky--so will keep trying to tweak it. We uninstalled and reinstalled Hardware and Software CD to try to get the scanner to work with no luck. No downloads are available yet but Brother is working on it. Not all the plug and play it should be but there is hope."
2,Must be related to a squid,"For the price, this printer has worked fine...until the black cartridge was empty. It went fast; used the ink like a squid being circled by a shark. Like other reviewers, I have had to replace all the cartridges to get it work again, even though there is still colored ink left. And if you just have the black ink in, you can not even print in greytone without the others. You CAN use the cheaper cartridges, even though Brother would like you to think otherwise. For my home use, it's an OK printer, but next time I'll read the reviews FIRST."
1,You Get What You Pay For - When Will I Learn,Wrong on both counts. You get what you pay for. I found the machine had limited compatibility on the software side. The ink sensing capability often indicated a cartridge was empty when it was not but then would not accept anything but a new cartridge (nice for Brother cartridge sales). The paper feed was less than consistent. I am a one person business with moderate to low printing requirements and this machine created more chaos than efficiency. My HP all in one is on order. It cost about 2.5 times what this machine does but I know I will get what I paid for. Would love to give this machine (and several cartridges) back to Brother but they do not seem interested. Not sure I could even give this thing to an enemy.
1,Don't buy one! Run away from them!,well I am now working on my 5th one witha return through the company. What a big let down. First 3 lost blue ink and could never get it to print blue again even though I replaced it with several new inks of there brand. This one screwed up after trying to print christmas pictures only new probelm now print quality is so poor it is like a hazy picture instead of the crisp ones at the begining. They informed me being as the problems always seem to be about the same they will refer me to the service center next. Sorry but I will never buy another Brother product again!
1,bad with ink,"As a courtesy to all those who might be taking the time to read this reviwe before buying the pinter, I would like to warn you that the ink system design for this machine is very bad. It uses black and color ink very quickly, and does not let you do any printing at all while any of the 4 ink cartridges are empty. Thus, run out of one color cartridge and you can no longer print black and white text documents. Very annoying, very expensive. I will do all I can to avoid every buying another Brother printer. Brother shows little respect for its consumers when it forces us to buy more ink than we need by not allowing us to print with the ink we have."
1,Cost a fortune to print using this one,"DO NOT RECOMMAND THIS PRINTER! There are 4 ink boxes and you have to have ALL of them NOT EMPTY in order to print! This is a BIG surprise! In addition to all the difficulty of using it, I can't even print a b/w page using a brand new black ink catridge only because one of the other colors is thought by the printer to be ""empty"", while there are still ink in it! I am giving up on it."
2,Pleasant But Unremarkable,"Dee Dee's second self-titled album (fourth American album overall) marks an end to the singer's comercially-oriented r&b;/jazz lite fusion period. This 1980 release is produced by Thom Bell (the Spinners, the Stylistics) who buries Bridgewater's firery charms with the already-dated Philly sound and material that sounds like Spinners rejects. The peppy top 50 r&b; hit ""One In A Million (Guy)"" is here along with the cult classic ""Lonely Disco Dancer"" and the creamy ""When Love Comes Knockin'"".Dee Dee's two previous albums (1977's ""Just Family"" and 1979's ""Bad For Me"") were charming because it featured a jazz singer's interpretation of r&b.; However on this album, Dee Dee's brassy style is neutered, and the singer simply sounds bored singing this so-so material, especially on the cutesy ""Gunshots In The Night"".After this album, Dee Dee swore off of r&b; oriented projects, moved to Paris, and reinvented herself as a successful, Grammy-award winning traditional jazz singer."
1,When oh when will the Flecktones be back?,"The last reviewer nailed it. I have personally seen the decline of Victor's Solo career over the past few years. Every show I've been to has gotten progressively more cheesy and less funky. And this is not just me, I see the faces of the other people and its not good. Its really sad because I'd love nothing more than to buy his albums and support him but Good Lord, these songs are horrible...and it pains me to say that. I'd love to have 5 minutes with Victor to plead with him to go back to how it used to be. Do yourself a favor and skip his solo stuff. First, buy Live Art with Victor playing with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones...and second, wait til the Flecktones come back from their hiatus. THEN, you will see maybe the most talented band on the earth play."
2,a good album,"this album is not really what i expected from victa.First it's kind of strange, but after a little while you get the fealing of victa playing that bass.the album is funky and a little bit oldschool, but overall i think it's a god album"
2,A disappointing retread of old Gibson ideas,"All Tomorrow's Parties reads like a poor amalgam of Virtual Light and Idoru. Several scenes of Parties mirror similar scenes from Gibson's previous work, and it's possible to imagine Gibson sitting down with discarded notes from Virtual Light and Idoru to crank out Parties. Worse yet, Gibson seems bored with the characters he reprises. It shows in his inability to have them do anything interesting other than act confused and make references back to the better books in which they first appeared. While the confusion of his characters worked in other novels, here it merely highlights the lack of cohesiveness in characterization, plot, theme, and even tone. Nothing is very smooth in Parties, and I must wonder if Gibson's finally out of magic."
1,Really bad book.,I can only assume that all the good reviews here were writen by Gibson's family and friends.
1,Yesterday's FanFic,I'm a big fan of Gibson from Burning Chrome forward. But this one was dreck. Gibson explains it clearly enough in a note at the end of the book when he attributes the book (or a chapter--it's not clear) to fans in Mexico City. The story has the feeling of fan fiction--take the parts from previous works and mix them together. The story is flat; the characters are flat; the novel reads like a story proposal for the publisher. sigh.
4,Background may help,"I've only read Idoru, of Gibson's earlier works. I'd been wondering how much I would have gotten out of this had I not read that. Rei Toei in particular seemed a little bit hastily sketched, and it seems to me that she might have been hard to understand without having read Idoru.And I wonder what I missed now that I know how many characters came from Virtual Light. When Rydell starts his journey on the behalf of Laney, what motivating backstory was I lacking? Would it have made a difference to my reading of the book if I'd known Chevette and Rydell had once had a history?In any case, it's a very smart book. Dark, moody, and rich."
3,"I enjoyed the book, but....","I enjoyed All Tomorrow's Parties, but I think Gibson can do much better. I've been awaiting new work from Gibson since Idoru came out and this didn't satisfy me. It is a decent story with good commentary on society and technology but it just didn't have the Gibson ""feel"" of his previous works. If you're a fan of cyberpunk definitely read it, but wait for the paperback."
1,It is not a good pick,"I have serious problems with this unit and with suunto:1. The unit came with manufacturing problem: the battery is not charging completely what is a severe problem to hikers2. The suunto's tech service & representative does not know how to fix it3. The warrant is not international, that means if you hiking abroad you are not covered.I believe you can have better options than this USD500 unit."
3,Very detailed but a very dry read,"Unless you have a photographic memory you won't be able to remember half of the historical facts and rules about the Pope, papacy, and the scenarios surrounding them. I've also read ""Secrets of the Code"", which I gave a 4 star and contained much more intersting materials. The first chapter has succeeded in putting me to sleep; had to fight my way through it. It's still a great reference for those of you that are meticulous."
3,Cowboys from around the campfires,"Some of the stories were entertaining, some were interesting, some boring. Nice short stories that one can imagine could have happened almost anywhere in the pioneer days."
4,Good scooter with bad instruction,"I found its instruction is NOT helping at all, so I had to ask my neighbor who is very good at sport to assemble for my son, even my neighbor thinks the instruction is very misleading. But it's a very good scooter once it's assembled."
5,Awesome Scooter!,"Awesome Scooter. Bought it for my son's 4th birthday he loves it!! So do I and my hubby. Great product not a toy scooter, real solid. So happy went with the Pro not the Razor A. Shipped in 5 days to Australia, great service thanks!"
1,Assembly Issues,"It is Christmas morning and I have spent the last half hour attempting to connect the new Razor Pro Scooter to the thicker fork tube. I found a memo on the company website from R&D; Manager Bob Hadley dated May 9, 2008 which says:Then, with a clock-wise twisting motion, push and ""thread"" the extension tube onto the fork until it bottoms out on the fork headset lock nut. This may take some rigorous twisting, but you do not have to be a muscle-builder to do it.This statement is an indication of a serious design flaw. I don't think it is possible for a mere mortal to assemble this scooter. I will keep trying rigorous twisting, but I wish our family had bought a different product."
5,This is the scooter to get.,"I am currently 15 and ride scooters all the time off jumps and have done a lot of crashes, spills, and wipe outs and this scooter still stayed together. On the other models they have not reinforced them enough and so i break them all the time i went thorough about 4 scooters and this one lasted me the longest. I have had it for about 9 months and it is still fine. I just need to buy new wheels and grips every once in a while which isn't a problem."
4,Razor pro Model Scooter,I bought this for my 13 year old son and he loves it. It has held up good and he is very happy with it. I will end up buying another soon for another son's birthday. If they are into scootering this is the one to get.
4,EXCELLENT!,when i first got this it was neat. but then it got rusty.iam a expert at scootering(btw im under the age of 12). if you want this scooter then prepare for some rustyness!!!! l8tr G8ter! swagger KIDd Out.
3,"Good scooter, but I got one not properly tuned","This is a great scooter, especially for larger kids or adults who will otherwise break the lower models. It is much stronger than the other models. The handlebar is also higher, which makes it possible for me not to bend over while scootering. The thicker grips are also more comfortable in my opinion. My only complaint is that the handles don't fit snugly into the handlebar, so it shakes around sometimes. If anyone knows how to fix that, please let me know. I recommend this scooter, but I took off a couple of stars because it came with a tight headset and I had to tune it out of the box. There is a slight chance that you will get one like that, so you can either tune it up yourself or send it back to Amazon to be replaced. I did it myself to avoid the hassle."
2,Disappointed,"I liked New Shoes and then I heard Last Request. Wow, nice voice, I thought. What does this guy look like? Hm, so young and already has a great voice. He's going places. So, I bought this album. The first song starts.... What! Where's that great voice in Last Request? I'm disappointed. Don't get me wrong, he's good, but the rest of the songs are just a bit too raw for me. Wish I had listened to cuts here first."
4,"It's a pleasure to walk ""These Streets""...","It's a pleasure to walk ""These Streets"". I bought this album on a whim. I was walking through Target and saw the CD and picked it up. I had heard of him a few months prior while reading a magazine. So, I saw his CD and figured I'd give him a try. That was a very wise choice. The best songs are...Jenny Don't Be HastyLast RequestRewindNew ShoesLoving YouAutumnOverall the whole album is great. His voice is super sexy and raspy. The music is catchy and emotional. Also, his lyrics are very deep for someone only 19 years old. If you like good music by people who actually have talent, spend the 10 dollars and buy his CD. You won't regret it."
4,"Great Hammer, but....",that cool little eagle design embedded in the head fell off immediately. Why did DEAD ON tools even bother. I LOVE the balance and feel of this hammer though. 21 oz is a perfect weight. I'd buy this hammer again even if the crappy logo fell off again.
3,Very Entertaining,"It was very entertaining reading what was considered ""polite"". All I can say is I am very glad I was born when I was."
4,Quite good on a whim,"I picked this up at my local used store for (in the end was free due to discounts) $4.99. It was a deal no matter what! I guess i was attracted by the cover, and then gave it a listen in-store to sample tracks, and for buying it on a whim, i really like it! It usually takes me awhile to commit to buying a CD, but this is well worth it. There's a lot of talent here (reminds me of Maroon 5 or Robin Thicke at times), and i wonder what ever happened to these guys... Either way, pick up the album that pop-rock fans may have missed out on!"
4,Freddy Mercury Action Figure,"Fairly good likeness. Not quite as good as it looks in the pictures. At least this one wasn't still wet when they put in the box, so the paint didn't come off on the plastic packaging like some do."
2,"Good idea, but it didn't work for me","When you buy older equipment that is not well maintained, it is inevitable that you will find old clogged greased joints. I bought this tool thinking it would solve that problem, by injecting a light solvent under pressure to dissolve the old grease that could then be forced out with new. I tried this on a backhoe but it has yet to work. In each case (about a half-dozen grease fittings) the grease was so hardened that you simply couldn't force the solvent in. I had to remove the grease fitting, force the solvent through it, and then drip solvent in the threaded hole. So what's the point of buying this tool? It is very well made, however."
3,too much filler and not enough meat,"Save Your Face could've been an excellent book but it has a couple of flaws. First, it takes the doctor too long to get the point. You can happily skip the first 20 pages. Second there is too much Baby Boomer self adulation. Speaking as a member of the generation that came after the Boomers I'm not impressed. His rejuvenation plan isn't that amazing. It's the same thing your local dermatologist would tell you. The best part of the book is when the doctor, a cosmetic surgeon talks honestly about what cosmetic surgery can and can not do for you and he tells you how to find a good doctor. If you are going to buy several books on this subject Save Your Face might be a good buy otherwise I'd say skip it."
3,Good for Christians,"This book is written from a Christian perspective with lots of scripture and history. It is written by a person who is a survivor of suicide and it shows. He has gone through a similar healing thought process to me. I found this to be a helpful book, but did not identify with the Christian beliefs, though I found it comforting that his perspective is one of forgiveness and love. I want to believe that my loved one is not in pain and is resting in peace. Above all, this book gave me that reassurance."
2,This book is not a suitable introduction to Complex,"As a math major at the University of Connecticut this book was assigned to me as assigned reading for Math 252 (Complex Variables) by my instructor. Since I can not understand a word my professor says because of his accent, I was forced to learn completely from the book. However, having not been exposed to complex variables before, this proved to be quite difficult with this book. I was forced to buy other books on complex variables in order to understand some of the basics of the subject. I assure you it was not due to a lack of intelligence or effort on my part. I found this book dry and far too difficult to understand despite the fact that I have an excellent academic record. There are better (and cheaper) books out there, keep looking."
2,circular logic,"In the beginning chapters of the book, I found circular logic, which casts suspicion on the rest of the book. First, the text proved that exp(A)exp(B) = exp(A+B) because to the trig identities sin(A+B) = sinAcosB+cosAsinB and cos(A+B) = cosAcosB-sinAsinB. Then it proves the trig identities with the fact that exp(A)exp(B)=exp(A+B). Circular logic.While taking the class, I thought the text was okay because it was easy to follow and had good examples. Now I'm am more advanced and use my texts to understand the subtleties of the theory and found this at the very beginning of the text. Are there more errors in logic? If so, is this book really worth using?I gave the book two stars because of its ease of use and examples, but cannot give it more due to the bad logic. If I find any more errors in logic I will change my review to one star.I've heard many people recommend Newman and Bok, so go with that one for an introductory book on complex analysis or Ahlfors for an advanced book."
4,Very good complement,Very good book to complement Complex Variables and Applications by Brown and Churchill. The solutions are well described and easy to understand.
4,A good practical look at a theoretical subject,"This book manages to provide an in depth treatise of some of the main application of complex analysis. The pace is fast, but the exercises and their solutions are well done, so self-study is quite a legitimate undertaking. I would not recommend this for someone who is new to the study of complex numbers, due to the fast paced nature. The book is more aimed at those who have already had some exposure to complex numbers, but haven't dealt with the analytical side. An undergraduate at University, for instance. (I have used this book as a textbook, doing undergraduate complex analysis.) The only gripe I had with the text is that the last part of the book delves into applications of complex analysis, when I was wanting more theory. So if you are a theory junkie, there maybe be better books out there, however this book does provide good tutelage in basic complex analysis."
3,Masters in math,"I'm taking this course for my masters in math, so I bought this book to help with my homework. And there are only a few problems from the text that have solutions. The problems my professor assigned were not in the book."
2,"Not that good, but love the direction","As with any mega artist that has been around for 20 years and released a crazy amount of singles and albums. Not everything by that artist is great. This is a prime example, while I thought Cowboy Style and Breathe were two very good songs that i play occasionally. The rest is really just filler. Drunk? Seriously, it's lame techno beats over her saying drunk(haha ok maybe not to that extreme but that's what it felt like to me). After hearing Cowboy style I expected this album to be really good,but was disappointed. I will say one thing, she did do any intersting job of fusing techno along with scottish/british rhythmns on her last few tracks. Other then that some of this album is like a bad kelly clarkson cd(even thought this did come out way before), and the other half a lame techno party. I would buy this album if your into electronic music, but other then that I wouldn't waste any money on it."
5,Enjoyable mystery with a twist,"A great book for anyone who likes mysteries, journalism, Southern literature or just good writing. Plenty of plot twists and turns and numerous interesting characters."
1,simple minded,"Not a spellbinding topic, to be sure. Characters were uninteresting and predictable. Lets dig a bit deeper shall we-Mr. Kay. I mean really, for readers over 10 years of age. Wish I could be kinder."
5,The Kidnaping of a Nobody,"I confess that I am a Terry Kay fan and have yet to find a book by him that rates anything less than 5 stars. This story, while it doesn't have the humor or chacters that shimmer (as in The Runaway), demonstrates the style of writing for which Terry Kay is admired by other writers. The story of the kidnaping of a nobody intrigued me most with the descriptions of the place of imprisonment. The plot was mild but kept my interest. I like it that Terry Kay is pushing himself into new areas."
4,Can You Demand Ransom for Kidnapping a Nobody?,"Set in Atlanta, Terry Kay weaves an intriguing and intelligent tale that revolves around an eccentric billionaire, his sexy assistant, his Lolita houseguest, a dedicated cop, a brash talk radio host, a leading-man movie star, corrupt bank officials and Aaron Greene, a real nobody. When Greene is kidnapped and ransom is demanded for his safe return, the plot twists and turns leave the reader guessing until the end. Terry Kay is truly of the best authors working today."
3,Not a fantastic Nail Trimmer,"The file on this trimmer, while convenient, was worn away after only a few trimmings. The guillotine is rather sharp and doesn't leave as many rough edges as the few I've had previsouly, but it does twist the thicker nails when its cutting causing pain for my two italian greyhounds which is not a pleasant experience for anyone involved."
5,"Shaft, the original 1971 classic on blu with a really cool rare extra, read on!","This is a great blu-ray release from WB.The original flipper dvd also had a vintage featurette, that is also on this BD, but there is a an extra that really makes this release special, the inclusion of a rare 1973 Shaft TV movie called ""The Killing"" it's in rough shape, but it's awseome that Warner Bros included it as an extra, so in a sense you get two films for the price of one!The PQ and AQ on the feature film is good for this 70's classic.Forget the Samuel L Jackson remake, THIS IS THE REAL SHAFT, as portrayed by underrated Richard Roundtree."
5,Very enjoyable Mozart,Lili Kraus is a link in the chain of masters to pupils starting with Mozart himself. Lili Kraus is playing with remarkable ease and makes you listen with concentration to the very convincing and enjoyable interpretations. Mozart himself would have liked this performance.I earlier have in my posession the Mozart Piano/violin sonatas with Kraus/Boskovsky and the pianotrios with Kraus/Boskovsky/Hubner. All favorites.LeifB
5,A must have if you adventure in the Realms,"This product is great! If you like to adventure in the Realms, this product is for you. It contains the whole globe of Toril, with an interface that lets you zoom in and out on a map without losing quality.It contains almost every map ever made of the Forgotten Realms, as well as Al-Quadim (Zhakara). And those maps that were not ready, or were left out they make available for free download so you can add them in.Another great feature is the ability to edit maps. Have some custom towns not found in an official product? Add them in to your atlas, and they are on the map! I would consider this product a must have."
1,A bad wave goodbye from acen,"What a shame. After brilliant tracks like Trip II the moon, a marvellous creative album (57 minutes) Acen endet with this. A boring sounding stuff noone really cared. I was very sad seein the past brilliant talent went away with this final number that really was not worth the disc used for. The good tunes die you it seems... Acen is now on doing movies or commercials - I wish him the best anyway of course."
1,Some helpful pregnancy advice but too alternative,"Unfortunately the politics of this book are a turn off, the author has little regard for the conventional family model of two biological parents being bonded to child"
4,Gritty father son drama in the Aussie Outback,"Well acted and paced father son drama. Outlaw loser dad takes off on the run with young son. The dad loves his son in his rough way, but he is also endangering his life. Teaches son survival skills, but also by negative example, how not to live."
5,A must see movie,"A very moving story about a boy and his father on the run from the law. Both Hugo Weaving and Tom Russel are excellant in this. Trust me, you will cry at the end of this movie."
3,OK this is not my usual review,"Ok, ya this is prolly the last thing you would thing a huge Psychedelic fan like me would review on...The only reason I am is cuz I remember this movie from when I was young, and Charlie Rich's song ""Sunshine Smiles"" was a very good track....seems to be a track that was never released on any of his CD's which is suprising cuz I mean I really don't like him at all (don't like country music in general) so for me to say I like a Charlie Rich song it is not any old song. Other than that all this is just the Greek type stuff that was in the movie, some of it is ok but I mean It's not really all that great besides the Charlie Rich song."
5,WORKS GREAT,wheelbarrow is easy to put togeather and is light weight and works great and it feels like it will last a long time!!
1,I got a dud.,"This charger has blown out about 10 fuses in my car. I needed both the charger and my headset for a road trip that I was on, so it was actually easier for me just to buy the fuses on the road than it was for me replace the charger. I've had numerous devices plugged into to my car's power outlet (DVD players, phones, a refrigerator, some were two at a time with a splitter). This is the only device that's blown the outlet (without a splitter, too). I have since bought another charger."
4,They work,"These work good. I only gave it 4 stars bcos i wish it was more sturdy so i could just leave it under the piece of furniture and it would hold its shape, but they are flimsy and u will want to remove them after u move the furniture."
1,These aren't good.,"I purchased the Amazing Sliders Furniture Sliders Set of 8 and the All Star Products EZ011106 EZ Moves Furniture Moving System with Lifter Tool & 8 Slides.All the sliders suck and the tool ripped a piece off the veneer. The tool to lift heavy items doesn't work well on heavy objects and you still need the assistance of a second person so you might as well just lift it without the tool. And the sliders just don't slide well at all.I also purchased EZ Sliders at my local Bed Bath and Beyond, they work great. They look identical to the Waxman Reusable Sliders Furniture Moving Kit that I've seen on Amazon. I've been using this one for quite a while."
1,HUGE Disappointment!!,"I have been a Tyson fan for many years, and this CD lacks everything I love in his earlier work. Where has his song writing skill gone? Some of the lyrics in this effort are just plain stupid and border on boring! You can bet I'll be selling my copy in the used CD bin!"
2,GAVE IT A CHANCE - STILL LACKING,"I've listened to this cd a bunch. If you want to have one of every Tyson cd (as I did), buy it. If you thought Ol' Eon was a sparkling gem, buy it. If you like Barry Manilow and disco music, buy it. If you like mushy gazillion track recording where Ian's voice, delivery and pacing get lost in the production, buy it. What's gone here (whether intentionally or through fatigue) is the crispness, the voice, the delivery, the picturesque imagery, and the pacing that makes Ian Tyson unique in ANY music, let alone western or folk music. If you've heard of Ian and want to get acquainted with what made him great, try any album but this one and Ol'Eon. Ian Tyson songs elsewhere have lyrics that command attention and prompted Wally McRae to write ""Give Us a Song, Ian Tyson"". To others this may be an example of ""artist's growth"" but to me it's a wart."
5,First Purchase Praise,Very satisfying to finally have this CD after 50 years. My girlfriend sang it at my wedding as it was a favorite. Amazon made it possible and have my deepest thanks.
1,"""REALLY DISAPPOINTED MOM IN STOCKBRIDGE""",WE BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE THE COLOR WAS NICE FOR OUR SON. IT IS A TERROR TO LET UP OR DOWN THE ROLLING HANDLE IS ONLY WORKING SOMETIME. ALL OF THE PIECES HAVE FALEN OFF TAKING IT IN AND OUT OF THE CAR DON'T BUY
5,Great Mini Helmet,This is a very nice replica. Very nice attention to detail. It looks great in my office next to my other sports items.
1,Eeep,"One of the most successful on-line critics, James Berardinelli is also one of the worst. This tome is every bit as accessible as his anti-art, grammatically incongruous and theoretically un-provocative reviews. Not to completely dog the guy. I'm sure he edits most of his own reviews for his website. Here he seems to have found an editor or two. Compare any one review in the book to the review as it appears on his site. They're still not very special, but at least they make more sense. Strictly for fans."
3,Mediocre Help with Outdoor Basketball,"Bought Mighty Grip soley to help get a better grip with basketball (mostly outdoors). Upon first application, my hands do get a better grip on the ball, but the effect diminishes as the grip material wears off or mixes with dirt and sweat. Probably would work better indoors."
2,inferior quality,"I purchased this video recently and although it arrived quickly and was well packaged, the video is of poor quality. The picture on the front is ot clear and crisp. The movie itself has an inferior look to it. The people within the scenes are rather unclear."
1,Exceptionally poor - a better version exists,"The 1998 version pales in comparison with the unavailable 1978/1982 BBC version with the exceptional Alan Badel as the evil Count Fosco. Beware purchasing this as the Ian Richardson version, because Ian Richardson was in both versions. If you must get a copy of ""The Woman in White"" right now, then order the 1998 version. Otherwise, write, e-mail, call, march and picket WGBH, BBC America and BBC England and lobby them to make the 1982 version available. The earlier version was produced in five 55 minute segments and was an oustanding piece of work."
4,"Not bad, as a minimalist synopsis of the novel","This is an excellent former Masterpiece Theatre presentation. At only two hours it takes on only the main plot thread of the lengthy original novel, which has been called the first English mystery novel. This two-hour version is fast-paced, suspenseful, atmospheric, and engrossing, but it is the ""Cliffs Notes"" version at best.The performances are convincing, the production seems high-budget, with many outdoor scenes and lovely costumes and sets. Go to the original novel for wonderful subplots and fascinating, intricate, pungent, detail."
2,try the 1982 BBC production.,"This 1997 Masterpiece version is not faitful to the book whereas the 1982 BBC mini-series is, and the acting is superb. It's really that simple. I have read the book and have seen both screen productions. There is no comparison. The 1982 BBC version is far superior and I highly recommend it.You can get the 1982 BBC presentation on Region 2 DVD. Multi-region DVD players abound and are cheap."
4,Very Good But Not My Wilkie Collins,"Once I got over my disappointment because of the many changes in story -- which is why there are four stars instead of five -- I have to say: this is a good one. I think the essence of most of the characters is preserved, especially of Marion (I love Marion) and the casting and acting was good -- but Count Fosco is too skinny; he's charming (at first) and evil, but lacking that wierd sinister quality of the original. I made a point of getting the Pride and Prejudice miniseries and I'm glad I did. The Woman is White miniseries? I'm still hoping for it -- but I have this, which is very good although still not my Wilkie Collins."
1,Pretty And Vacant,"Oh please - not another new age book of babble with not one bit of science.Instead, it's false promises for those wishing for some sort of false hope and while it's fine to hope for whatever it is one wishes, these sort of books prey on the witless, the clueless, those who fall for a description with absolutely no proof and surely, by now, these sort of books should be banned, or, at least, the people who write them be held accountable for the quackery they promote."
3,All dialogue,"My mistake. I didn't read the description carefully enough, and discovered that it was all dialogue. It was interesting. I'll listen to it one more time, but then I'll just pass it along to someone else."
4,Life over fences,"A fine memoir of a life in and around horse racing, especially steeplechasing. Well-written and moving."
2,I don't like it,"This keyboard is decent, but the spacebar sticks really bad. It is really annoying when you are typing really fast and the space bar doesn't register. I wouldn't care if another key stuck that was less used, but the space bar is one of the most important keys on a keyboard, and if it doesn't work properly then the keyboard is useless. I would go with the Logitech S510 instead, that keyboard has the best tactile feel of all of the keyboards I have used, and I have used a lot. Good luck in your keyboard search."
1,HORRIBLE! PLEASE don't see this movie!,TOO BAD MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I think that this TERRIBLE movie doesn't reflect the real Japanese. Many Japanese got angry after seeing this movie. Very. Gedd Watanabe(actor) isn't Japanese. He is Japanese-American and he can't play a Japanese. It's an insult to the Japanese. Be free from racial prejudice fast!
1,Gung Ho 2000,"I can't believe that this movie inspired a tv show. I seem to recall the show being on the air but I don't remember ever watching it. It must have been terrible, perhaps even wore than the move--if that can be possible. This movie was horrible, one of the worst I've ever seen. I consider myself to be a consisour of bad movies, but this one was so horrid that it was beyond the realm of entertainment; it managed to transcend its medium altoghether--a rare accomplishment for anything. This movie had absolutely no reedeming qualities. The script was beyond hackneyed and the stereotypical portrayal of the Japanese business man made me want to track down Opie and give him a good smack. This movie didn't even make me think about laughing. It was painful to watch and I highly advise that anyone with a brain avoid this movie like the plague. This movie didn't even deserve one star, but, unfortunately, one star is the lowest rating possible."
3,A fun look at the way things were...,"I worked in a theater with this movie in 1986, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Never saw a Japanese person back then, never had any intention either. Now, after being intertwined with japanese culture, and having visited 4 times, I think the film is quaint but fun.If you look at past films that were a reflection of the events of the time, naturally you will be upset. But, some people also get upset when they look at the nutritional content on their box of corn flakes, and cause constipation in the morning. This was a romp based on the times, and had roots in reality.Apologies to those who can't find humor in parody and lampoon, even if it is cultural."
4,A fun movie about a tough time in America,"This movie gives a glimpse of how America came to terms with its economic fallibility. In a way, it was prophetic becuase so many American companies have partnered with Japanese companies in just this manner, and had the same kinds of growing pains. Ron Howard gave a touchy subject his magic, and Gung Ho! is a hilarious and delightful story.Some people find the movie a simplistic version of an American-Japanese culture clash. Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! Good comedies don't portray reality, but they make us THINK about reality, which is much more important. In that aspect, Ron Howard and his talented cast did a great job."
3,Worth watching,This movie is funny and worth watching. Watching this movie was an assignment for a class I have been taking
5,Russell Watson-The Ultimate Collection,"I bought this CD for everyone that I needed a unique gift for at holiday time. What an amazing repertoire of songs and WHAT A VOICE! Russell Watson seems like this everyday, random guy...but,when he sings--the world stands still. Most noted are his choice of accompaniments from ""Volare"", complimented with a full orchestra, to ""Barcelona"", a fun vocal with rap star Shaun Ryder. Excellent choice."
5,fresh scent on time,"I received the cologne within 3 days of order date, much earlier then the delivery date.It was in it's original packing, the box was unopened and the cologne has a great smell good for both day and night-time wear."
4,Kennth Cole Black smells and wears well,"Kennth Cole Black is a really good value. KCB smells very nice(not too sweet, not too musky) and lasts a lot longer than my Armani Code and is more affordable."
1,"Tester, no box, no lid","Purchased this to give as a gift and it arrived without the original box or cap and is clearly marked ""tester"". Not cool."
4,a good choise,"i bought this cologne and i like it, smell good a very nice scent, this is a good choise for cologne i recomend it"
5,great,I think it smells good. second time I got this because the first time I was so happy with the product.
4,KCole Black,"As advertised, lasts around 3to4 hours on my body then turns into a more ""fruity"" smell which actually smells better than the original. Packaging was original and had no problems as some other reviews have stated."
5,"VERY IMPRESSED, CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!","THE PRICE IS UNBEATABLE, AND THE SMELL IF WONDERFUL. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. YOU CAN BUY 2 FOR THE PRICE OF 1 IN A DEPT STORE."
1,Knock off/ bogus,"I would like to know if there is anyway to get a refund of my money for this bogus product. Having owned a Kenneth Cole black before I instantly could tell this was not a genuine product and was ripped off. The packaging is shady and the scent does not even resemble the genuine cologne, not to mention it is very mild. I had to spray it about 8 times to pick up a scent and it lasted about 10mins. I want my money back...."
3,required for class,"This book fails to include hard science in some of the writings so the agruements are slanted towards one viewpoint. Interesting reading but could of been even better by including all the points of view and causes of some of the ""spiritual emergencies."" A good introduction to eastern points of view and alternate non-drug treatments for mental some disorders."
4,"Excellent storyline, but..","for me, the story is marred by grammatical errors, over use of commas and exclamation points, and numerous mispelled words. I found it difficult to read for any length of time, but made my way through it.The story itself is excellent, full of twists and turns and the angst that only family can provide. Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, I highly recommend this book."
4,More evidence that life never ends!,"George Anderson shows some of his psychic abilites but the messages that come from ""the other side"" just add up to more evidence that life continues on after so called death!An excellent read and a nice follow-up to his first book."
3,It's a bit slow,"Paper Hearts is equal parts documentary and unscripted ad-libbing. Not quite as good as a mockumentary by say Christopher Guest, but it does have some funny moments -if you are into this type of entertainment. Overall, I found it a little slow and a struggle to maintain my interest. Fans of ""Knocked Up"" might recognize star and creator Charlyne Yi, as the dorky girlfriend of one of Seth Rogan's roomies. She brings the same effervescent geekiness to this role."
1,Not for everyone...,"This movie is not for everyone. Some find it originality and cute, some find it boring.Personally, I find the movie to be boring. My con about the movie: Poor acting (overall). I get the point of the movie, but I feel that it is a bit silly to make a movie to understand why you ""cannot fall in love."" My opinion? Don't awaken love until it so desires (it did happen in the movie!). Pro: it's good to learn and ask question from people about love and how they come to it. Although the movie is more like interviewing people and their idea of love, it's the acting within the interview that is boring (and everything between it).P.S. the girl is cute."
2,The word Scheisse says it all,This is not the sort of book you should buy if you are serious about learning German. It is the sort of book you buy for a laugh rather than to learn some informal conversational German.But it is great if you want to surprise your new German friends and associates with your bad language.
3,Aural Caller ID Only On Base Unit,"Was going to purchase the ATT 5840 but elected to purchase the 5870 due to the aural caller ID feature. I thought the caller ID would be announced from handsets but that is not the case. You have to be within earshot of the base to hear the talking caller ID. Frequency band 5.8 only used between handset to base - 2.4 used between base to handset. Range has not been a problem for me but then I don't wander too far from home. Phone book entries must be entered into each handset manually. Look, feel, sound quality and other features of the phone are top notch. You can use more than one handset to get in on phone calls which was not the case with the Sony 2.4 phone system I replaced. Best price I could find on the net for base unit and two 5800 handsets came from sellcom.com ($290)."
5,Very nice phone system,"I had bought this system and was very pleased. It served it's purpose. I no longer have it, but i was sure a fan at the time. Excellent range, held lots of phone numbers, could page any handset and it looked cool."
5,Of Spirit and the Universe,"I find that my emotional self is instantly accessed. I cry, am filled with a wonderful joy and all the feelings in between. Whenever I listen to Ray Lynch's music I am moved into a spiritual place that is non-dimentional, a universal place of great beauty."
2,An OK camp,This book about Jessica and Elizabeth hiding Grace in a secret place at camp(because Grace snuck away from home)is something I read once in a blue moon.It is good but not overly rereadable
1,Do not count on the warranty,Truth be known I enjoyed the spa until a wall section cracked and several of the seats developed cracks. I was told no problem they were under warranty. I was then strung out for three months. Three monthes down the road I was tld the warranty does not apply to abuse -- I am a fit 62 years old and the only user so I have trouble seeing it as an abuse case. I wrote the BBB and they tried and gave up on the manufacturer. My latest round with this product was the failure of the topside contoller -- the replacement part lasted 30 days and I was told there is no warranty period end of story -- if there is a rating lower than one star this pproduct has earned it
4,NICE,"THE WATCH IS PRETTY NICE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND, THE PRICE IS FAIR FOR THIS WATCH. I"
4,great watch,"I love this watch, both me and my wife have it. It is simple, light weight, practical, causal and yet with a touch of class and elegance. Fantastic! Though the plastic band could be kind of expensive and hard to replace."
5,This is a must have to pass the boards!!!!!!!!!,I highly recommend this book before taking the boards. It was the main tool i used to study by and I passed with the computer shutting off at 75. Especially if you are not all that comfortable with computer programs the disc that comes along with the book contains software the simulates the computer generated NCLEX. It even shuts off after you passed or failed. I glad I found it and just wanted to share with everyone else.
1,Lack of Important Adjustments,"There is no width adjustment and no height adjustment. Circles appear slightly elongated vertically. Not too bad, but enough to be irritating.I can't imagine a monitor without these adjustments."
1,good story,it is a shame this copy is so poor. this is a very good movie and the acting is great. the picture is deplorable. the sound comes and goes. cheep is and cheep gets.
5,"A Great Marriage of ""Talents"".","This is a fabulous combination of two phenomenal talents and I loved it so much that I give it as gifts... and the receivers are immedate fans. I'll leave the technical jargon for those more gifted and eloquent writers and conclude by saying, it was wonderful!"
5,LOVED IT!,Ordered for my wife. She listens to it daily. Nice to listen to as you fall asleep. Sweet dreams!
5,Perfect clasical for all ages,this musical is a one of the best hollywood remakes of a famous play i have seen. it really captured the timelessness on the whole atmosphere and provides entertainmeant you won't ge nowadays. the songs are also very well done wondreful!
5,THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE!!!,"A CLASSIC...that's it in a nutshell. Most musicals that are turned into movies are not that great. But on the other hand this one is amazing. Frank Sinatra may not have a big part, but what he is in his super and that goes for the lead character Marlon Brando, too. Everyone should see this movie sometime soon. THIS IS A CLASSIC!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I PROMOSE!"
3,Whate exactly is deluxe about this edition?,"""Guys and Dolls"" is considered one of Broadway's ""perfect"" musicals, and this relatively faithful screen adaptation captures the feeling and more importantly, the choreography of the original (unlike the recent ""Chicago"" which for reasons unknown didn't preserve Bob Fosse's brilliant choreography, substituting Rob Marshall's deeply inferior choreography instead). No fear here - the bulk of the original Michael Kidd routines are nearly immactulately reproduced, and the feel is fantastic.That said - what exactly is deluxe about this new edition - how does it differ from my 4 year old version, also wide screen? Not an accurate description of the product, so, to those of you who own an older copy, no need to trade it in for a new one, but for those of you who have yet to own one - buy it!"
3,not entirely new,"I love this movie. It has terrific music and Marlon Brando, in this unusual (for him) part, is a real treat.However, this particular disc came to me NOT wrapped in plastic... as I figure it should have been if it were new, plus the storage box (yes, it's a box; it also has a book inside containing material related to the movie) looks as if it's been banged around a bit. This disc itself is pristine so I'm not returning it. But in point of fact it doesn't look new. And THAT'S what I paid for!!!I am not recommending this seller."
3,Guys & Dolls,The DVD was fine and in good condition. Too bad the movie wasn't better. Marlon Brando singing? Come on...The play was ten times better...
3,Dissapointment,"I couldn't find any of his other albums, so i bought this, not realizing it was live. It was a waste of $20.00 The background music is too distracting and the screaming fans are annoying. I should have been more patient in finding his other albums rather than snatching this up."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Because thiis is a live cd the audiance is anoying on the flip side I dig any hip hop group that chooses to use real drums and guitar,I don't know a dam thing hes saying but his rhymes still sound tight,and as far as his dj's mixing and scratching goes theres a lot of room for improvment,the beats are so so"
4,"Goodbye, Robert -- you were my adolescence","I saw Robert Goulet in CAMELOT on Broadway when I was 14. My dad brought home the ""Always You"" LP -- and it was love from then on. I saw him in concert in Atlanta -- for one week, every night as I apprenticed at Theatre Under the Stars and he sang ""Georgia, Georgia -- where on a clear day..."" in the wings -- to me! I was 18 -- what can I say? I still have the LP, but glad to have the CD -- it's a great way to remember him."
3,Middle of the road noir,"I'd recommend this book only to someone who wants to read exhaustively in the noir canon. The plot is predictable, the protagonist not very engaging, and several key plot twists run the risk of coming out of nowhere. The attraction between the protagonist and the femme fatale just happens, and facts that emerge about her towards the end of the book really call into questions some things about how the relationship begins in the first place.Hard Case Crime has brought out some really great noir treats, both hostorical and contemporary. This is not one of them."
2,Rather Average Crime Novel,"The Vengeful Virgin is a rather drab, typical noir story without a lot of action or mystery behind it. Shirley Angela is an 18 year old trapped taking care of an ailing, mostly bed-ridden step father and she just wants out of the trap. Plus her step-father is rich and she'll be set for life when he finally kicks off. Enter Jack, a TV repair and salesman whom she's called to install an intercom system and a TV. Shirley manipulates him to help her do away with the old guy, a rather easy task since she is sexy and Jack is allured not only by what she offers in the way of prurient pleasures, but even more so the money.The story revolves around Jack and his ineptitude at getting away with what he does, and frankly is rather tedious. It is, thankfully, a quick read and mildly entertaining, if not anything beyond an average crime novel at best."
5,"Fun for Kids...and Mom and Dad, too!","Like many of the other reviewers, this was one of my favorite LPs as a child. Now that we, the first generation of listeners, are in our 20's and 30's with families of our own, it is time to pass on the fun to our kids. Times change and tastes change, but certain things remain timeless, and this is one of them.The variety of music is sure to please even the most discriminating Disney connoisseur, with its mix of disco versions of Disney classics and original tunes. From the Brazilian beats of ""Welcome to Rio"" to the Village People-inspired ""Macho Duck,"" this CD is fun for everyone.If I had anything to criticize, it would be that it looks like this album has gone out of print again. <sigh> :o(So...pull out the CD or dust off your old vinyl and get those dancing feet moving!"
4,"Excellent Show, Amazing set... but one thing lacking","I love this show, which I missed on the network the first time around. The disc set is incredible - much more than even the biggest fan would want. The only thing I wish the set had was english-language captioning (or at least closed-captioning). Some of us with bad hearing rely on those to make sure we're not missing any of the great dialogue. Otherwise, 5-stars and a super find for anyone unfamiliar with the series"
5,Great Show,"Freaks & Geeks is the reason I barely ever watch TV. That this GREAT show was cancelled after 18 episodes (Only 13 aired I believe)when endless lists of horrible shows go on and on season after season is exactly why TV sucks. Freaks & Geeks is such a great show, the actors are perfect the writing was spectacular. NO coincidence that the group responsible have been coming out with the best movies of the last few years as well."
4,Nice discussion starter for youth,We use this for HS youth video nights. Good topics for discussion. Generally suitable (should be previewed episode by episode).
5,Wonderful and Funny!!!,"This show is great!! Watching it makes me so angry that is got canceled because it was such a clever and real show. You will laugh, cry and be left wanting more. The acting is exceptional lead by the beautiful Linda Cardellini, who portrays Lindsay Weir with so much honesty you can feel everything she feels. If you are like me you will find yourself watching this DVD over and over again."
1,Price?,"Okay, I loved the show as much as the next person, but this is a lot of money. I would've spent $50 on something like this, but not as much as they are asking ($127 at the time of writing). Seriously, just buy the regular season DVD, you get some good features and what everyone else looks for, the show."
5,"ITAM GOOD,SERVICE NOT","I ordered this product,it was sent twice within weeks of each other. I have been on the return website and there is no record of this purchase although I was charged for it. My computer also got a virus from this website!"
5,"Wake, Flat-Face and son of an unclean animal...","My enjoyment of this collection of stories goes well beyond the excellent writing and exotic locales. Harold Lamb, by way of Khlit, has taught me new and wonderful ways to insult my family and coworkers without uttering a single foul word. My wife is now ""The Daughter of the Devil's Dog"".In all seriousness, my discovery of Lamb is exciting and I look forward to reading all the volumes collecting his stories. They are fun, exciting, interesting, and sprinkled with humor. Khlit is a cranky, cantankerous old man who can back up his words. I love the political incorrectness with which Lamb writes. His stories come across as being authentic.It's easy to see why Robert E. Howard and many other notable authors enjoyed and were influenced by Lamb's work."
5,Looks Good!,(Havent played the game yet) From what I read this game looks like an amazing game. The variety of races and hero classes looks huge. People seem to be a bit picky about graphics but I worry about gameplay and not graphics. I hope to play the game soon and have fun with it. Thank you amazon because I wanted the game for a while but could not find it for sale anywhere and did no want a used copy but was looking through amazon and found this game. Hope to have a lot of fun with the game. :) Cheers
1,I was misled by all these glowing reviews.,"Let me qualify something. I have a two year old. This book is not good for a two year old. Pictures: Poorly done, with some artistic watercolors that are really to dark. Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department. The pictures are really elementary in skill level. Story: This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals. I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care. The message also offers no solution to the problem. Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something. Text: Not a rhyming book. Actually, just did not have good flow. I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy."
5,"toot toot! Chugga, chugga..","From the time my girls were teeny, they adored this book! There's so much to see -- and of course the story line is a great one to ""walk"" the kids gently to bed. I started reading this to them when they were 1.5 yrs old. Now they're 8 & 6 and still adore this book!"
3,good voice,"the girl can really sing, but I like her r&b/pop songs better because her voice is best suited to songs like miss independent, but she's pretty and I have to give it to her for going a different musical direction with this CD, even if it doesn't work to her advantage all the time, she had hit singles from it and one can only wonder what her next musical move will be."
1,Where did Kelly go?,"I loved Kelly's first album, but Breakaway sounds like a bad Avril Lavigne imitation."
1,ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE DOWNWARD MUSIC TREND!,"They have taken a sweet, country girl and turned her into someone unrecognizable. The very unflattering photograph on the CD cover makes her look like she's on drugs. The music inside is just screaming noise. The madness has got to stop!"
4,Kelly Clarkson,"Kelly's voice sounds beautiful and has quite the range. However, unlike other performers such as Celine Dion, she doesn't try and overtake the songs. The ""band"" does a good job of balancing out the overall listening experience. The music's tempo is very good with all the beats and rhythms of the songs and her voice blends in with them beautifully. I think that in the future she will go far and her success will get bigger. She is a very talented and accomplished young lady and she will do well. The more she tries and the further she gets the better she will be not just for her but for her band and all of the fans that support her. She came out of no-where and she has done really well to come this far. She should be proud of what she has achieved and hold her head up high for whatever comes her way."
3,it's ok,This cd's songs mostly have a rock like feeling and I don't think Kelly is able to demonstrate power in her voice too well. I think she is a good singer but this cd disappoints a bit. She should sing some songs where she can demonstrate the power in her voice.I hope people realize that i'm not trying to go against Kelly or anything....ino she's a great singer....but i just don't think she embodies the power and beauty of singing in these songs...
4,Very good,"I don't understand why people are criticizing Kelly for not writing all of the songs and claiming she has no talent because of that. Elvis didn't write any of his songs, is he untalented too? Give me a break.This is a much better album than her first release. My guess is that she had more input on choosing which songs she wanted on the album, or maybe she just has better people working for her on this one."
5,More than an American Idol...,"You know, people really tend to get caught up in the American Idol craze, but honestly, I have always felt that Kelly Clarkson was the only person who truly deserved to win. Her first album was amazing, very pop, but still very good. I was very shocked however when I listened to her sophomore album. I got it because I was addicted to ""Since U Been Gone"" and it really has blown me away. It's different, with more of a rock edge, which I think is a brilliant move. Her voice truly shines through on the songs, and you can tell how it has grown while listening to the album. I fully recommend this cd to anybody who truly loves music and doesn't simply stick to one type of music. Kelly has shown that she is more than just a pop, American Idol winner."
3,Not like Kelly,"I was surprised when I first heard songs from this CD. I didn't feel like they sounded like her. I feel she has lost some of her own ""distinct"" voice that makes her Kelly. I honestly did not even recognize her voice when I heard her being played on the radio. As for her CD cover, I saw a promo poster for her CD in the store and I did not even recognize her, if her name wasn't on it I would have never known it was her! I saw Kelly in concert and really liked her style and I feel some of that has changed. I think they have tried to make over her looks and her voice too much.That being said, I know her new CD will be very popular, it already is. She is a very talented singer and I am sure she will still be great in concert, I do love her live version of ""Beautiful Disaster"". She is getting great radio play, it is just that I feel that some of this new stuff is too much like material already out there. But I guess that's what the public wants."
5,Kelly Clarkson is perfect,This album is perfect. I've never expected Kelly Clarkson to release an album like this. After I heard Breakaway I didn't like it at all but then she released Since U Been Gone and Behind These Hazel Eyes. I got this cd and is great the best songs in the album are:1. Since U Been Gone2. Behind These Hazel Eyes3. Because of You4. Gone5. Addicted6. Hear MeThe others are ok but this ones are the best
4,very listenable CD,"Living in Europe the past six years, I've only had brief exposure to American Idol during visits back to my home in Ann Arbor. I first heard Kelly Clarkson on the radio and decided to look her up online. I bought her CD online. Its found its way into my rotation. I like just about every song on the CD. Unlike many CDs where you occassionally feel compelled to skip a track or two, Breakaway doesn't have any such songs.So what if she's 'manufactured' as some critics claim. Just because she didn't write the songs or play all the instruments, doesn't mean that she has no talent. Someone still has to sing the songs! She obviously has a lot of talent or she wouldn't have won Idol."
5,Didn't want this cd...now I can't get enough of it,"I did NOT want to buy into the whole American Idol thing. I rarely buy pop albums to begin with, but my 5 yr old was begging for the Kelly Clarkson album because she loves her songs when she hears them on the radio. And now I have to admit, it has become my favorite cd! There are so many hits on this album that you already know, plus the other songs are great. Kelly's voice is unbelievable and the songs are fun and upbeat. You can't help but sing along. No wonder she won so many Grammy's for this! Buy it - you'll be sucked in too."
2,avril wrote the lyrics,"How can you compare avril lavigne to k*lly cl*rkson. avril can play the guitar,piano drums and writes her owbn lyrics. and she even wrote this song,the lyrics are even coming from avril lavigne. how sad people can bep.s i gave it two stars for avril lavignes lyricsgreenday rock!"
1,This is simply the worst ever !!!!!!!,"Looks like another one bites the dust. Why do all these female singers start out singing GOOD and then change over to screaming and yelling. Christina, Britney, Jessica, and now Kelly. I had high hopes for her, but no, she had to fall into the rock pit with the rest of them."
1,Don't waste the money!,Buy Bo Bice's new CD instead! Bo 's CD has better songs too!All Kellly does is scream!! Support Bo and help his sales. Go Bo!
5,Best of the Best,"This is a GREAT album full of rock,pop,soul and just awesome tracks. I find it funny when I read reviews who give this album 1 star saying ""it's not my kind of music, so therefore it's terrible"" Umm well if it's not your kind of music then why are u even wasting your negative energy to review it or even listen to it and then calling it terrible because you're board? I guess you're deaf.Kelly is an amazing singer who can sing the freakin' dictionary and make it sound good. Nothing she sings sounds bad so stop the hatin' and clean those ears up."
1,"Can I leave a ""minus"" star rating????","To put it kindly, Kelly Clarkson sucks! She blows like Katrina in the worst way! Who ever told this cellophane child she could sing is nuts!!!She is a 4th rate Avril Lavigne wannabe, and who in their right mind wants to be her!?!?!? She (Clarkson) should go back to McDonald's, or KFC, or anywhere there ISN'T a microphone!!!! SHE STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Kelly's Awsome!,"I loved her album,but I thought all thesongs kept on going on,because they are all on the same subject.Catchy and worth it, though!"
5,Wow - why did it take so long to discover this talent,"I bought Kelly's first album and didn't go out and buy this one right away. I must admit though that the endless times of hearing her played on the radio made me want to bite the bullet. I am so glad I did! Now granted, the first time around some of the songs might not seem desirable. I guarantee that if you listen to this CD all the way through twice you will be hooked. I can't stop playing it! My poor neighbors."
5,Breakaway from the Old.... Embrace the New....,"Having purchased her last album, I had no idea whatsoever as to what to expect from her sophomore album. Her last cd was very pop... and, sadly, it had but a few good songs. I was cautious to buy this album, but after hearing ""Breakaway"" and ""Since U Been Gone"", I knew there had to be something different. I was right... this album is just as the title suggests. She broke away from her old style and its restrictions and has directed her music to a more rock, hard-driven pop style. I am so pleased with this cd that it almost seems necessary to leave it in my cd player. If any listener liked her first two singles, he/she will love what remains on this album.The memorable, the great, and the masterpieces...1. Breakaway2. Since U Been Gone3. Behind These Hazel Eyes4. Because of You5. Gone6. Addicted7. Where Is Your Heart8. Walk Away9. You Found Me10. Beautiful Disaster (Live) (Recycled from her 1st album...better than the original)"
5,Kelly Clarkson does it again,"This is even better than her 1st cd (thankful). Kelly Clarkson has an amazing voice. My favorite songs are:Breakaway (#1)Since U been gone (#2 and my fav)Behind these hazel eyes (#3)Because of you (#4)Gone (#5)Where is your heartWalk awayYou found meHear meThe rest of the songs (addicted, i hate myself for losing you, and beautiful disaster live) are okay too"
1,Even More Disappointing Than Her First CD,Kelly is a gifted vocalist but the songs on this cd are so awful that you can't even tell how good she is. I was disappointed with her 1rst cd but this is even worse. This music is so awful it gets on my nerves. It's such a shame to waste a voice as great as hers on this material. I hope her career does not continue in this direction. I hope she will soon record music that is worth listening to. With her great voice there is so much she could record. Maybe a blues cd or a cd of remakes or even a gospel cd. I would love to hear her voice on gospel music. Almost anything would be better than this.
5,Wow...Just...Wow!,"I wonder how we all went so long without hearing music like Kelly Clarkson sings it. I have never heard another artist sing with so much emotion. Plus, the girl wrote half of the CD. I actually own 3 copies of this CD...one for my house, Car, and Job. If you have never heard it...why? Kelly has amazing range, she's very soulful and, at the same time, pure pop-rock.:) Every song is a hit. My personal favs. are Addicted; Hear Me; and Because of You. Since U Been Gone and Breakaway are also great. And to top it all off, she has a live version of Beautiful Disaster that just kicks [...] on the original. If you really like this album, check out the Breakaway Limited Edition album with the SUBG and BTHE remixes, plus all the live songs. BUY THIS ALBUM, IT's A MUST!!!!"
5,Finally!!!,"Finally, an album worth bragging about. I haven't been a Clarkson fan for the longest time. Ameriacan Idol overdid the whole singing thing. It just seems that people feel in love with her, before her album ever got produced. Breakaway appeared. I have to admite that this cd was nothing like her debut album. Which is a good thing! What first struck me was ""Breakway"" a soft and heroic blend that draws you into her style of music. Next, ""Since you've been gone"" hit my ears. A pretty decent song, until I heard the best song of all of them ""Behind These Hazel Eyes."" Wow! I have to say it is a mix blend of Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch, with Kelly in it. The best of hers. Other songs are good, but not as good as ""Hazel Eyes."""
5,Kelly BREAKS AWAY!,"This is an amazingly powerful sophomore album from the ORIGINAL AND BEST American Idol. From ""Breakaway"" to ""Since U Been Gone"" to ""Beautiful Disaster,"" Kelly's phenominal voice gives you chills. One can hope she'll be around forever."
4,"Good,but not definitive","You have to admit on the excellente tecniqui this pianist has. He plays with the depth & expression necesary for these marvelous works. The only stepback I think is the B-flat major sonata, which has a messured first movement; not to mention the sound, a bit dry and close-balanced."
3,Better without Hair,"The R & B is great, the show tunes not so....Black Pearl is a Spector Gem, but Love Is All I Have To Give is almost like discovering a lost Righteous Bros. track.Worth it for those two tracks plus the other Spector-picked R & B tunes."
2,misleading image,"I was disappointed by this product, the spacing between the bamboo pieces is almost as wide as the bamboo pieces themselves."
2,"Okay, but not great","I found this book somewhat helpful, but felt in the long run that it was a waste of money. We will get all of the same types of information by actually visiting the schools."
3,This edition is in Spanish!,"Just a warning - even though the excerpt is in English - imagine my dismay when the book was delivered to me in Spanish! Upon closer inspection of the description, it does say the language is Spanish, but unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention. I can read Spanish, but it's harder and I was hoping for a quick read."
5,Who needs fast fast fast?,"When I got this cd I didn't know what to expect and to my surprise it is one of the best cd's i've heard in a long time. I congratulate Dewayne Woods on his 1st cd. I personally get tired to listening to fast fast fast. DeWayne's cd offers something I've haven't heard in a long time, so thank you. If you want something different than the standard stuff that is played today, try this cd you won't be disappointed."
2,It's not all there,"most of the links don't work when you click on them, unless you type in the link manualy, then they seem to all work, no mousepad has shown up yet, other than that 90% of what is on the CD was in the movies and the TV specials..and most of the videos i expected to see on the CD were in reality on the website."
1,HORRIBLE DEVICE --- Hated It!,"This was awful. I had it for two months before it would just FREEZE for no apparent reason. The headphone jack was always a bit sensitive, in fact often making songs sound one dimensional. Thought I was saving money but in fact I am now out $268. DO NOT BUY..."
1,it sucks,the battery drained out even after fully recharged quickly.it's heacy and slow. the buttons are difficult to use at times. the organizing program is much more difficult to follw than the ipod.Buy the ipod instead!
4,Creatuve Nomad Jukebox Zen,"I love the product, the sound quality is excellent and with a $7 adapter cable, you can hook it directly into your home amplifier and it comes out with a very decent sound quality. This ability allows you to play music at home without having to change the disks.It comes with a extensive userguide. However the descriptions on how to set up the music library and transfer the music to the jukebox are not well written and not user friendly. It took a lot of trial and error to get the music catalog right. Also a very important and convenient feature to obtain the album title, track information detail and artist name automatically from the web by clicking a button was nowhere mentioned."
4,Sleek and Solid,"Like many others who have written reviews for this product, I was drooling over the ipods, but was reluctant to spend that much. I decided to get this 30 gig for less than the price of a 20 gig ipod. I think that the aluminum case is much more stylin' than the ipod, but the ipod might have better controls. The little black scroll button that you also push to select is a bit funky. However, I've only had it a week and I'm already getting the hang of it. All in all, I think it is a good purchase. The software was easy to install and the transfer easy and FAST. Ripping your cds is as simple as putting the disc in the drive. I still have about 20 gig left for future music. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Good clippers,The clippers are very good quality my only complaint is that the file is useless and the styptic powder is a mess and really hard to dispense.
2,No Height Adjustment Makes It Frustrating for Baby,"We thought we were doing a good thing getting this for our son for Christmas, but to our surprise it's not adjustable! He wants to walk, but he can't touch the floor. For $59 I would have liked to be able to use it. He loves the music and with a pillow under his feet he can sit in it, but he get's frustrated when he tries to move it and can't. Now it'll be March tomorrow and he can touch the floor, but not enough to get it moving - he just ends up made and crying. We are going to end up going out to buy another one that is adjustable... what a waste of money! Who would make a walker for an infant that isn't adjustable to their height? He's 27 1/2 inches and can't put his feet flat on the floor... an since he's of average height at 6 months old I would suggest that most babies will have the same problem."
5,Happy Walker,"I know, I know...walkers are dangerous, right? However, I really love this item! The walker has a lock on it...so you can set it not to roll around. Then, it works like any other little bouncer seat. The lights, music, and activities fascinate my 6 month old, and I will soon release the lock and let her motor around, under my supervision. I really like this item!"
3,Decent test review...,"This book is obviously made for people studying (or reviewing) for standardized tests. It contains a good overview of algebra and geometry. Topics are explained in a ""light"" and easy to understand language. Although I liked the inclusion of ""formulas"" throughout the book, I wish the authors would have made an appendix with all these formulas consolidated into one easy reference section. I also would have liked more of the ""plug ins"" (sample problems at the end of each chapter). For each chapter/topic there were only 5 problems to do. If you want to read about math and not a lot of ""homework"" this is the book for you."
1,Not Informative,"I assumed this book would contain more detailed reasons about what therapists should say and why. What I read was mostly very simple and boring dialouges between therapist and patient, but these are just examples that repeat themselves throughout the book. I painfully made it halfway through the book before I decided to completely give up on any interesting sentence that I might come across. I think it's one of the worst books and a waste of time and money."
2,A huge let down...,"I honestly was really excited about this book, thinking it would give me new insight into the band's history. Instead, I felt like this book was just simply recycling facts that we (as hardcore pavement fans) already know. There is very little information that can be found only in this book, I would argue that almost all of the information is taken second hand from internet fan sites, magazine interviews and the Slow Century DVD. To me, this book seems pointless and it doesn't appear as though much work was put into making it.Maybe I should start publishing books like this. Seems like a nice way to take advantage of hardcore music fans."
3,Sarah Brightman - Harem Dersert Fantasy,"The DVD would be breathtaking if:for God's sake, why the video picture is not sharp? Why most of the video picture is kind of blurry? It's a pitty! It spoils all beauty of this DVD.With todays technology even average quality of picture should be much better.Next time I am buying CD."
2,Great But Beware,"Look I like this item BUT........I wanted a Rake and Scoop not a little scraper. I can take some of the blame as the item does say say Large Spade Set but shows a rake with the large set ion the picture and in the description.If you want a RAKE then I assume this is the set to buy.http://www.amazon.com/Four-Paws-18245-Rake-Large/dp/B0002AT45K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1294428363&sr;=8-1On a side note the handles are long BUT they are made of wood, my prior scooper / rake set had steel handles which have lasted 5 plus years and are still going strong.I am rating 2 stars because of the misconception that you may be getting a rake when indeed you are getting a very small scraper blade and large scoop"
3,It's OK.,I just don't think anyone wants to make a quality pooper scooper. These items arrived as described and work (for now). The quality of the large pan is questionable at best. It could be great if the company just reinforced the pan where it meets the handle. The large size pan is nice if you have multiple dogs. This item received 3 stars only because of the quality concerns.**NOTE: This set arrived in a HUGE box that literally could have held 15 of these units.
2,"Aluminum, not Stainless Steel","These are made of aluminum, not stainless steel. I will keep them because they're at least as good as the broken ones I currently have, but I'm very disappointed that the description is wrong. I chose them specifically because they were stainless and they would be more durable than aluminum."
3,Only for beginners,Easy Machine Quilting is a truly basic book for machine quilting. It is not for the quilter who has mastered putting on a walking foot or done any free motion quilting. I was disappointed.
1,poor quality construction,"I can't say whether the scale measures well or not, because I was never able to assemble it. Assembly should be very easy- just two screws- but mine was not machined properly and it was impossible to get one of the screws to fit properly."
5,sharper1,"Awesome is the only way to describe this CD! Toots with Clapton or Toots and Bunny you would expect to work, but Toots and Shaggy singing Bam Bam? It works great! I keep buying and sending this CD to people - I enjoy it so much I want others to as well (no I don't make copies, something this good deserves to be financially rewarded). Buy the CD, if you don't like it, sell it on Amazon, and I will probably end up buying it from you."
5,NOT buying this cd should be a crime!,"I have been listening to reggae/ska for a long time, seen 100's of live reggae/ska concerts...including the Man..TOOTS. This is one of the best cd's I have purchased in a long time, if not the best cd I have EVER purchased. This entire cd is full of so much raw energy and soul...that only Toots is capable of producing. The guest artists add so much to Toots' one of a kind sound. I have a feeling that this album will finally put Toots and the Maytals on the charts in America. It is a truly amazing album, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys high-quality music."
5,Sucker Sticks and a Delicious Treat.,"Sucker sticks are not just for candy anymore! We purchased a book on Cake Pops (OMG) they are the most awesome desert pieces in the world! Using the sucker sticks to hold the Cake Pops is an Amazing idea. I just received another fundraiser idea from a friend which includes a marshmello on a sucker stick and then dipped in chocolate candy topping! I think these sucker sticks will be very busy during football, wrestling, baseball & basketball season next year!"
3,The H.T.3 - self-titled (Dionysus / Bacchus Archives),"Garage rock / surf music rarity that some fans & critics have written off as a pure waste of time. No necessarily true. Here you have twelve songs - the only downside is that the duration is 27:18. This disc's instrumentals are so-so as the the other songs are better. Tunes that I got he most out of are ""You're Gonna Leave"", the Beach Boys-like ""You're A Mystery To Me"", the (actually good instr.) ""Each Night"", as well as a couple of novel tracks ""Boots"" and ""I Fell In Love (With That Wart On Your Face)"" and ""Hey Little Girl"". Wasn't able to find much on the Internet about The H.T.3 but according to the liner notes, these songs were initially recorded in 1965. Line-up: Hal Witzman - guitar & vocals, Rick Holtan - bass, Harley Toberman - piano & organ and Myron Goodman - drums. Might draw in fans of the Kingsmen, Sha Na Na, Beach Boys, Dick Dale and that fictitious band in that movie 'That Thing You Do' The Wonders."
4,Excellent guide,"I bought several hiking guides and general guide books and this was the one I found the most useful. There are so many great hikes in Utah it is hard to decide which ones to try. This book provides enough detail on enough hikes to be very useful. And they have already narrowed down the choices by limiting it to 50 hikes, so they are already wonderful. The information proved very useful in my opinion. [...]"
1,No Hike Maps,"I'm planning to visit Utah for the first time and wanted to use this book to scout hikes.If you aren't planning to hike or prefer only written descriptions you might find this book more valuable than I did.The book has a plethora of written information, but NO MAPS of the short hikes. I'm glad I pre-viewed this book at the Library.Just a little sketch map of the road leading up to the trailhead, the general shape of the trail and intersections with other named trails for each hike would be very useful. See Best Hikes near Portland by Barstad for an example of maps with more than enough information for casual hiking."
5,This book can change your life!,"As a career counselor who often works with disillusioned and unhappy attorneys, I really appreciated Steve Keeva's book for its understanding of the inherent difficulties in practicing law and its wise and compassionate solution.For unhappy lawyers who still want to practice law, but also want to enjoy it more, Keeva's book is an important reminder that, while we may not be able to transform a whole profession, each and every one of us has the power to transform ourselves. It takes just as much courage for lawyers to stand up for themselves as it does to stand up for their clients.I thank Steve Keeva for writing this book and can only hope that his readers heed his message and heal themselves."
5,Forest Service History,What an interesting production! I could watch it over and over again. It's very inspiring and thoroughly fascinating.
2,Excursion watch there are better choices,"I purchased this watch in 2002 and the movement has broken twice. Once the stem pulled out of the watch when switching to Daylight Savings time; once the hands stopped moving. The second time it broke the watch was out of warranty; Swiss Army agreed to fix it for the cost of the part without charging for labor after I told them I expected better from a Swiss watch. Now the band has broken. I have always been very careful with this watch. It looks nice, and when I bought it I wanted the alarm. Now the alarm is unnecessary since I use the alarm on my cell phone when I travel. I expect a lot more for a watch at this price. I have had less problems with my Timex sports watch, a Citizen casual watch which doesn't need batteries, and my Seiko dress watch."
2,i was a bit disappointed.,"Just wanted to throw out a few words of caution to anyone like myself who may have heard ""In Search of Souls"" on Pandora or somewhere and had to find out about this band: the rest of this album is not as catchy. While I like a lot of Death Metal, I also dislike a lot, so it is possible that people with different tastes than my own, or more dedicated fans of the genre might really enjoy this. I however did not, apart from that one song, which totally kicks ass."
5,PNY chip,"This was a great investment as it increased my RAM memory. When I first ordered a memory increase from Amazon, I had ordered the wrong one. Amazon returned my money and the people at PNY put me on the right track for a replacement. No hassles."
5,Awesome resolution of my too slow computer!,Awesome resolution of my too slow computer - I am very happy and pleased to spend less than $50 instead of buying a new computer to replace my 6-year old slow poke - it is so fast now it's hard to believe - I went from 500 MB RAM to 2.5 MB RAM - Happy days!
5,Runs well on DELL dimension 4550,"Where recognized with no problem on old DELL dimension 4550, runs well. . . . . . . . , . ."
5,Works Great,"Product was exactly as ordered, arrived quickly, and was well packed. Took less than 5 minutes to install and is working great! So much better than 256MB of RAM originally installed. Price was 50% less than what Best Buy and other brick and mortar stores were charging."
2,not happy,"Simply put, i recieved the item. Had to destroy package to open it. Only 1 of the two memory modules worked. The one that was installed showed no improved performance to my computer. I was very surprised. An unhappy experience for me on this purchase."
1,"Faulty, had to return","I popped them in, no problem. For about four hours operating time, they were great. My seven-year-old PC worked like new!Then, all of a sudden, I started getting crashes, fatal errors, emergency memory dumps; the computer became nearly unusable. Every web browser crashed within a minute.I pulled out the new memory and computer went back to normal. Requested refund and am returning to Amazon."
1,made computer unstable,"I got this set of 2x1GB to upgrade my current PC3200 1x512MB setup (emachines). Since there were only 2 slots available, I removed my current stick of RAM and put in this set. Initially it was ok, but subsequently, the computer took multiple rounds to boot up (power on, didn't boot, power cycle xN until it worked). I don't know what was going on, but when we switched back to the old stick, the computer booted ok. Return!!"
5,Works great with Dell Dimension 2400!,"I upgraded Dell Dimension 2400 from 1GB to 2GB, now it works great. It looks little overpriced if we compare with PC2 or PC3 RAM but for this old computer(Dell Dimension 2400) this is the cheapest option on found on Amazon."
4,Good RAM,"Had for 9 months and work perfectly. NO grumps. Customer Services stinks, Other then that, great product. Always remember to research your motherboard before you order."
4,helped the computers,It was fairly easy to install and has helped the computers hugely. I would recomend this to anyone that would like to speed up thier computer.
5,Upgraded Netbook,The memory was shipped fast and it really speeded up my netbook. I homeschool and needed to upgrade the netbook so that it would run Switched On Schoolhouse software. It worked beautiful. Now I don't mind using the netbook when my husband is on my laptop... lol
2,Memory,"I ordered 2 (two) of the very same memory sticks, low and behold, when i had my computer guru install them, the system shut down. Looking at the sticks, which came in the very same packages, they happened to be 2 (two) very different sticks. Since we had opened them and tried to use them, i did not send them back because i felt you would not think they were the ones sent. We since then have tried them seperatly in different computers and have discovered 1 (one) is good and the other is bad!!!. so, my rating is only half good because I only got half of what i paid for."
3,seller was Link-Tronics Memory,"I've ordered the 2x1GB Dual Channel Kit before from Amazon, which comes in a shrink wrapped package. The PNY logo is everywhere. I ordered 7 of these from Link-Tronics, in 2 separate orders.Pros: Items came quickly, shipped through USPS. The item was in a sealed anti-static package. They seem to work fine.Cons: It isn't PNY RAM you're buying, but rather some unknown brand with a Link-Tronics sticker that they probably printed in-house on it stating that it's DDR 400 PC3200 modules. I thought perhaps they may have made an honest mistake, but the invoice they supplied specifically states that it's PNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit. BOTH packages contained invoices as such. I don't think it's right to state on an invoice that you're selling one thing and ship something else that's probably inferior."
3,PNY Brand Memory from NemixCorp,"First: The memory modules shipped by Nemix are working OK The Invoice correctly lists the PNY item brand and PNY model number.The Gotcha: The memory modules are NOT PNY. They are Micron memory modules They were shipped in an antistatic bag within a padded envelope. No indication was included of a substitution of an alternate part.Nemix offers a lifetime replacement if it goes bad. However, consider the future reception likely if I were to return them due to a failure: The order and invoice documentation indicates PNY brand but they receive a Micron part. Slick, huh?The memory works, I've learned something: I would avoid Nemix for any future purchases."
1,did not work,"I ordered a proc, mobo, case, psu and this memory etc to build my firts pc. When finally it arrives (I live in Panama central amercia and from Miami to Panama it took like 4 weeks) I was very anxoius and finally the pieces arrived.I built it and thought everything was well placed and when i connect it the monitor didn't turn on. I changed the video card and nothing. Then i remembered that this memory had some bad reviews(i never pay too much attention to reviews) and decided to change the memory with one 512 of my main computer a Dell which had 2x512. It worked, but i am very dissappointed with this memory and the brand.Please trust and buy something like kingston or corsair. BTW athlon 64 rulz!! i had always use intel (wiht Dell) but this pc is blazing fast wow!sorry for my bad writing my native language is spanish"
4,No complain now,"I have added this module into my desktop memory slot about a month ago. Seems like, it is getting along with its old neighbors in a new environment without any complain. Promise, anything annoying happen I will come back to give a frown against this product."
5,Perfect fit and works great,"Fit my Sony Vaio VGC-RB40 with no problems and the speed is good. Needed the memory for my upgrading of the computer to Windows 7 Ultimate. Also replaced the video card to a NVIDIA 7600GS which got this computer current. Fantastic deal on the memory, best price I found on the web with free shipping"
1,generic ram with a brand name,"I would classify this stuff as ""useless"", perhaps updating it to ""mostly useless"" upon further review.Note: this RAM is not meant to scale to lower FSB frequencies. That is, every other stick of PC3200 RAM (200 Mhz FSB) could scale back to PC2700 (166 Mhz FSB) or PC2100 (133 Mhz FSB) without incident. PNY does not recommend running this ram at any speed but PC3200.But I'll go one further and say don't even run it at PC3200.Like the other reviewers, a friend and I each bought a stick at TigerDirect's low ($20 post-rebate) price. It wasn't worth it! Our computers wouldn't even boot. This is defective stuff.Verdict: avoid this, and by extension, avoid PMI."
1,Did not work and now computer does not start correctly,This is easy to install but did not work with my computer though it is the one as per parameter.Now my computer does not start sometime or get stuck in middle or give message cannot ready memory.
5,works great,"I have memory from PNY before with great results, so I knew what to expect as I upgraded and doubled my memory on my older HP media center PC. Got the memory very swiftly and it installed easily with no problem. The immediate difference was everything worked quicker and smoother. I like that the PNY memory is compatible with all Mhz of older processors, so no problems there. Just a great product !!"
4,Good memory,"Well, what can you say about the memory? I just hope it lasts, though I already had bought this brand before and never had any problems, that's why I got more memory of the same brand again."
5,Ram,"I was needing to speed up my computer, it only had 512 RAM so I bought 3G RAM. They worked great and things are working right along!"
5,"The best sound, under rated","Yamaha receivers always produce clean sound. The power output is always under rated, add about 30% to they number they give. Most of the other receivers over rate the power output, they produce that power but it bad sound at the top end that can damage speakers. The only bad thing is the remote is just 'ok' it serves its purpose, but don't plan on using it for a unversal remote."
5,A good general look at the history of western architecture,"Wodehouse and Moffett do a good job of jamming the whole history of western arcitecture into an easy to read compact work. They cover the biggies and touch on the lesser known but important works. There are ample illustrations and notations to diagrams and photographs. The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan. This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general. There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck. This book is certanily not the end all of any time period, but for casual scholors of architecture or those who need to know about a building in X time period, this a great book."
5,Oh my!,"This stuff is GREAT!! I won't get all graphic but let's just say that our ""happy time"" just got happier ;) It is lasting a heck of a lot longer than any water-based lube we've used so I am ecstatic :D"
1,Terrible Product - Poor Ronco Customer Service,"This dehydrator was the second one purchased through Amazon. The first one had 4 out of 5 trays that melted. Calls to Ronco were a run around. I was asked to submit photos of the damage, which I did - no response from Ronco. After 5 calls to Ronco's customer service, they finally told me that I could ""replace"" the trays but I had to purchase them. I was not about to do that as I felt the product was defective and should be replaced by Ronco.I turned to Amazon, explained the situation and Amazon graciously replaced the product, paid s&h; back to Amazon and I thought I had gotten rid of a bum dehydrator. Wrong!!!! The replacement melted with the first use. I returned it to Amazon and was issued a credit. Do NOT purchase this product - it is a potential fire hazard and the customer service at Ronco stinks!I will purchase another dehydrator from Amazon but it will not be Ronco's."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"This is my second Ronco Food Dehydrator. The first worked fine for 20 years. This one melted and cracked after two uses. This is a piece of JUNK now. If you call to complain, you have to pay tons of shipping and handling charges to get replacement parts. They charge $14 for the base, $6 for the top, and $2 per each tray. Basically, you have to re-purchase their piece-of-junk product if it breaks under warranty. Nice warranty, huh? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Nesco makes a much better one for a little bit more money.Oh, and it doesn't even dehydrate well anymore. Now that I have the Nesco and Ronco and have dehydrated simultaneously, I can unequivocally say that NESCO is the best! Ronco sucks!Update: After my third use, the trays cracked and melted so badly that they were no longer useable. I just threw the dehydrator away."
1,Adding mine to the pile,"I received this dehydrator as a Christmas gift last year, and I have used it here and there for jerky, drying peppers and herbs. It's been ok. Yes, it took FOREVER to dry anything, but the trays had yet to crack and melt. Notice I use the past tense.Left the unit on last night to dry some cayennes, but it was cold when I woke up. I wasn't able to get the coil to heat up again, double-checked the plug, etc. When I took a very close look at the heating element, I could see that it was broken...the ceramic around the connection between wire and coil was shattered. Dud.Lasting less than a year with fairly light usage is pretty pathetic. I'm not going to bother with Ronco's warranty, based on what I see here. I would rather get a new, better placement from a more reliable brand and forget this Ronco disappointment ever happened."
1,This product SUCKS!,"I got this as a present and have used mine TWICE. The trays are melting and cracking. I have contacted customer service, but have not received a response back. I will NEVER buy another of these. I can't believe these guys are still making and selling these. VERY POOR PRODUCT"
1,Won't make Jerky,"I specifically bought this item to make home-made jerky. The unit has no blower and does not get warm enough to dry meat within 4-6 hours. The meat is dried very slowly at a luke warm temperature over 24 or more hours. I do not consider it safe for raw meat processing, even if that meat is cured with jerky cure and preservatives prior to dehydration. Once I added an additional hot, dry air souce, it worked fine. To do this I placed it next to a Nelco dehydrator (with blower) and forced the blower air from that unit into the Ronco dehydrator. I have not yet tried to use it for herbs or fruit."
1,yuck!!!,"I wouldn't recommended this product to anyone. I used it once, and rotated the trays every few hours. I went to check on it and rotate 4 trays were melted, not just ruining the trays but also the food that was being dehydrated. Do not buy this product."
4,Just like I wanted!,"These sticks really do have the volume of a Rock style stick with the lightness of a 5A. Thanks, Chris."
5,A Cornerstone Title for any Borderline Literature Library,"Covers ALL aspects of the condition from etiology, new theories, treatment and pitfalls. Although technical in nature, treaters should have no problem in getting through the material and greatly enhancing their understanding of Borderline Disorders."
1,"AWFUL, DANGEROUS Product","My boyfriend and I usually use regular fingernail clippers to trim our cats' nails, but tonight we decided to try the Bamboo nail clippers for cats. The experience upset us both.. Not only did the clippers RIP off my youngest cat's nail and SHRED the little bit that was left, but the metal clipper part chipped and folded over from using it on one nail! I do not recommend this product to anyone who cares about the well-being of his/her cat! I will certainly be returning this product ASAP."
5,An EASY watch,"I was surprised I actually liked this movie as I usually avoid ""cutesy romances"" like the plague. This was well done and really is a movie one can easily relate to.I'm not saying I would buy it but it is worth a rent or a late night stay up on a movie channelMarguerite Moreau is a pleasure to look at clothed or not and although not a challenging role she handles it quite well and realistically"
1,Painfully bad,"The low budget mediocre acting is somewhat forgivable, but I can't look past the over the top plot and emotional psychosis of the main character. What should have been a quirky romantic comedy turned into an incestuous love fest where everyone is sleeping with everyone else. Not only is it a cliche and tired plot, but far from anything remotely realistic. Furthermore the main character is painful to even watch as she traipses through life being ""easy"" as it were because she's an emotional vampire. In the end we question whether she can be happy with any of the characters, much less the man she ends up with, because she can't ever be happy on her own.None of these characters are exactly role models nor do any of them actually make for an interesting movie. Save your time and money on this one due to its sheer lack of originality."
2,Chick Flick all the way,"There's really not much to this movie. There's no comedy, no action, no suspense, no thrills of any kind. Some women may find a little bit of drama in it, I'm not really sure. I'm a guy, so it's definately not for me. What's advertised on the cover, you get very little of in the film. The girl pictured on the cover hardly reflects the one in the film, so if you are going based on that, then be prepared to be disappointed, just a fair warning. And if you are looking for any sexual content, then look elsewhere. There's really not much at all. A very lame film for men, but it MIGHT be ok for women, I've sat through much better chick flicks though, forcibly at that. Two stars, probably only deserved one. But I don't hate it. I just don't like it."
5,Great Story for your 5 year old.,Saw this on sprout with my son. He loved it. Since I saved in on our tivo he has watched it over 10 times. Now we are getting him the dvd. It is a musical with lots of fun for you and your kids and to enjoy.
2,Bob the Builder: Built to Be Wild,It was very slow and dull for a start and did not hold the attention of the Bob the Builder's 2 1/2 year old fan. Not up to expectations.
3,It's hot.,"There is no doubt that all these songs are great, and from their best era, but get ""What Hits"" instead. That has eight more tracks, almost everything here, and alot that is not. So whether you're looking for ""Behind the Sun"", or ""Under the Bridge"", ""What Hits"" is red hot. This one is just hot. Of course at this point they've put out four more albums, and probably need a 90's best of too."
5,my girl,my black sister will always have a place in my pocket for as long as she keeps making cds i'll keep buying them.
4,it deserves 5 stars for brotha alone,"god i love that song (despite what Kosmo77 says) considering its a breath of fresh air from all the black male bashing that contemparary pop/R&B artists put out .but i also love i wish i didn't miss you anymore.angie's voice is verry old school and soothing to the heart and soul.she reminds you of the lady who had the powerfull solo during the church choir.its to bad that she doesn't get much recognition as her hip-pop/R&B counterparts like you know who.eitherway this is a great cd and i hope she sticks around unlike other great artists that get snubbed,and shelved by their record labels because they don't know what to do with them.in short get this cd if you like good R&b soul music."
5,ONLY GAVE 5 STARS BECAUSE ***10 STARS*** is not an option!!,"THIS is the BEST R&B/NEO album... definitely the best released of the year... but it's one of the best in History... Angie Stone is a REMARKABLE talent with an AMAZING voice... I do not think this album received the level of recognition it deserved. Overall, Angie Stone is one of the strongest voices in R&B/NEO soul to date. I can't pick a Favorite because they are all equally awesome... I give two big, big, big thumbs up to this album!!!!!!!!!! Just put it in, Press play! No need to skip tracks."
2,Marie Antoinette Paper Dolls Review,"This paper doll book is beautifully rendered (like all of Tom Tierney's work), but it disappoints with it's lack of historical accuracy. Firstly, the doll itself bears no resemblance to the extant portraits of Marie Antoinette. In fact, the doll and a gown(plate 4) look as if they were based on a portrait of Madame de Pompadour. Marie Antoinette would not have been amused!There are also a few costumes which would have been more at home in a Jeanette MacDonald musical than in the eighteenth century (most notably plates 4 & 15).Having been a fan of Tom Tierney's work for many years, as well as someone who is fascinated with the eighteenth century, I expected more from this publication."
2,Not for a Mac!!,"Have had this for 3 frustrating days. Two tech support people said it is FULLY compatible with my OS 9.2.2, BUT they offer no drivers, no encoder info or software, and the word Mac is not shown ONCE in their manual. Latest email not answered, and spent 22 minutes on support line with no answer. Would give it zero stars if possible. Will be sending it back to Amazon and look for a reliable company.Will change my review to 2 stars as I had to purchase outside software to get it working. But still no answer to my email and unable to delete any files in the unit even though I deleted them out of the folder on my computer. No instructions in the manual om using the Trash folder. This manual is sad as is the support site."
5,Fascinating Look at the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank,"This book was of great interest on many levels. It is a fascinating history of the ""Nobel Prize Sperm Bank"" and founder Robert Graham. It also tells the very human story of some of the children conceived via this sperm bank. I found this book thought-provoking, funny, and informative. A great read."
1,Wow I can hardly wait for the movie!!!,"This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time.The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page.Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work.I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick.Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest."
1,The mirror is awful.,The reflecting layer of the mirror started to erode (decay) in a couple of weeks after installation. Now the damaged area covers almost one third of the mirror.
1,Very flimsy!,"Very Disappointed!!! $25 down the drain1 This set is rediculously flimsy! We'll be lucky to get a few good cleanings out of it! Rake is tiny, and teh pan is comparible to the cheap disposable tin pans you can buy at walmart to cook your turkey in! Buyer beware!"
2,Doesn't work in the cold weather,"I actually ordered the spade set, but received the rake by accident...I thought I'd give it a try and it is TERRIBLE. I live near Chicago, so it's cold here, but my dog still has to poop. The rake is flimsy and did nothing to get the poop that was more than one day old...those suckers remained stuck to the ground for dear life. I had to get a shovel and go around loosening them in order to pick them up, making it take twice as long. Cheap CHEAPLY made rake!"
