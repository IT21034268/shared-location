1,* 1/2 stars,"hmmm.This seriously for fans only. Rudess shows only here that he can play fast but that about it. and here he works out rather than creates composistions. Playing every effect on his keyboard as if the keyboard were to be banned for all time tommorow, Rudess has little or no knack for mood or melody. Its entertaining at times but it only shows as a reminder of his little idea for dramatics in a band who channel big epic melodramatics.self serving"
1,Dreadful,Hate the hero (the philandering dog).Hate the heroine (completely unconvincing).Bailed very early.Yeesh.
1,Sandra Brown Worst,This the worst Sandra Brown novel ever. I know that Sandra Brown has a knack for making impossible situations seems likely. But this is beyond Chantal Dupoint kidnapps Scout and shoots him all to build a bridge for the people. Wonders why Scout is mad meanwhile he falls for his beautiful captive. Talk about Stockholm syndrome at work. This is a total pass. Stick to Richocet.
4,Audio Review,I listened to the audio version of this story and had quite a different reaction then the people who simply read the book. I am sure that 100% of the reason for that is the amazing job that Bernadette Dunne does in her interpretation. The differentation between characters was like none I have ever heard. The french accent which she gives to Chantel is perfect. Her breathy voice lends a sexiness to the story that would be impossible to get from the written text. I would highly recommend this audio book to anyone looking for an escape.
1,A History of Violence,"I HATED this film. I had hoped to learn about the ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""prenatal"" life in the region. But the entire film is about postnatal fighting. Fighting, fighting, fighting!The film is for people who find fighting to be glorious - for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game.This ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric. And it sanctified the barbarism as being something good, something heroic. Surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this. Surely the viewers deserve more than this History Channel pandering."
2,Broke in less than a month,"I had high hopes for this player... An alternative HD mp3 player to, perhaps, match the ubiquitous iPod. The only reason this player gets 2 stars is because of its stellar audio performance, the audio quality is far better than the iPod (have had both I can say this). HOWEVER, and this is a big however, my player's hard drive stopped spinning after less than I a month. As a result I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. This type of performance is unacceptable. So I say to those of you who are adventurous enough to hope this player will work; but it for the audio quality. Otherwise, get something that has been in the market for awhile."
2,not very informative......,I was disappointed in the book. Just couldn't get much out of it. Not many detailed how-to's.....
5,Five stars are not enough,I'd need more than five stars to rate this other masterpiece of one of the best Argentine Tango orchestras of this time. Simply wonderful!
3,Good writing...,"But, the story is so tawdry & Jimmy Donahue so scurvy, it's a hard read. The author presents information about his upbringing that tries to make you feel a little sympathy for Donahue but it's hard to feel sympathy for such a loser. The Duke & Duchess of Windsor were wastes of human beings, too. The more you read about them the more discouraged you get. What wasted opportunities! They could have done so much good but were such selfish, self-centered & STUPID people. No wonder the Royal Family can't stand to hear their names mentioned. The book reads kind of like a prolonged Dominick Dunne article in Vanity Fair."
5,"Canus Goat's Milk Bar Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)",I really liked this soap! It dosent dry my skin out and it has a wonderful scent to it.Would recommend .
2,Didn't come,"I ordered it after I saw the author on TV after New Town. As psychotherapist,I was impressed by what she said about these teen boy mass murderers. I ordered it as a Christmas present for my step-son who is an assistant principal in an elementary school, but it was sold out. Guess a lot of other people had thesame idea."
4,Good sociological treatment of a disturbing topic,"An in-depth look at two school shooting cases, supplemented by statistics about the trends in school shootings over recent decades. Because each member of this group of sociologists writes his/her own chapter, there is some repetition of information, but the gain in reading each contribution is to understand the multiplicity of factors which coalesce in the shootings. It's not as simple as violent video games, or bullying, or family life, or youth culture, or socioeconomic status, or racism, or academic success. One key factor, among several others, is the tendency of school personnel and community members to overlook children's signs of distress and to give kids the chance to start over in a new year, neglecting to accumulate a historical record of kids' transgressions and thereby succombing to a kind of wishful thinking that kids will turn out okay in the end. So many do, but those who turn violent have escaped the radar of the adult world."
5,BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE,"I was surprised that 2fast2furious was better than the original. Most people thought this i'm sure because Vin Diesel wasn't in it. But Tyrese steps in to take his spot and he is much better in the movie than Vin Diesel was. He brings comic relief to the film without losing his edge. the story is alot better than the first, the cars are nicer, and it just seemed so much more upbeat and exciting. u gotta see it. the new cast is way better than that of the fast and the furious."
2,The Fast and The Furious is way better than this one,"I cannot feel the quality of the film, although there are expensive cars. The story line is so so and the charactors didn't put much effor during filming. In The Fast and The Furious, I can feel the love, the friendship, the leadership and the emotion of Dominic's heart. In this movie, I felt that those racers are more like ""gangs"" rather than ""teams"". The friendship between 2 main charactors is just too weak to hold the story up."
3,- - -,"2 Fast 2 Furious was a movie like any other about cars, drugs, and more cars (and of course girls). However, Paul Walker's acting could have been a litte bit more convincing. It's a little more than obvious that his ebonics just did not work for his character. Next time, Paul, choose a part where you don't have to fake your entire dialogue."
2,Terrible,"There was a lot more street racing in this, but it sucked. Suki? Who thought of that genius character. She seemed so bad at acting. Maybe it was because her dialogue sucked! This whole movie is bland though. When you hate the characters, you hate the movie. I hated the characters, and you will too."
2,Pretty lame,"Computer car stunts? Have we all forgotten the lessons of the 1970's, where a couple of good car wrecks could save an otherwise lousy movie?I'm being generous giving this 2 stars. John Singleton is horrible and should immedietly be deported to the former Soviet Union.Lame cars, action, lame everything. Go rent Hooper instead."
1,Hey Amazon,Do away with the gold box deals. YOUR PRICES SUCK. I laugh every time I look in mine. I can always go some place local and get what you have ON SALE for half the price of what you are selling them for. Get real.
4,A Pretty Good Sequel!!!,"I have to admit that I had my doubts about this sequel when I realized that Vin Diesel was not going to be a part of the cast. I had even bigger doubts when I found out that Tyrese was going to be in the movie (I always doubt singers turned actors). But I must say that I really enjoyed ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".In this film, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), a former cop, enlists the help of childhood friend, Roman Pearce (Tyrese), to bring down a very wealthy and highly dangerous criminal in Miami.The cars are faster, the people and locations are more beautiful, and the story is much lighter than the original. There is much more humor thanks to Tyrese and Ludacris, another music artist who gives a great performance!I would suggest seeing this film. It's definitely one you don't want to miss!!!"
4,Much better then the first...,"I enjoyed this movie much better then I did the first. There was non-stop action this whole movie. The first race & the big stunt was awesome. I figured the rest of the movie would be great & I wasn't disappointed. Great racing the whole movie. Tyrese was a great addition to this movie & he'll give you many laughs. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who want to sit back & see some good racing, awesome cars & neat stunts."
1,The star is for the skin,"I can not begin to talk about how today's youth are drawn to franchises. I would love to start on the bad acting. But, then, I would have to get at the plot that was most likely stolen from the mind of some shallow teenager. That would make me talk of how this is just a real expensive commercial for foreign car parts. I just want to leave the people with one thing to say about the bad movie with a worse title. The chicks are hot."
1,A bit too much like The Simpsons hit & run,"When I first saw the preview of 2 fast 2 furious in the tv commercial,I thougt that the movie will do a great job bringing the old cast back from The fast and the furious.But when I found out that Vin diesel was'nt going to appear in the second part,I was'nt happy about it at all.However,Paul walker who play the role of an ex-cop,tried his best to save the movie but he could'nt do it...It did'nt get the good stuff that part 1 got,the driving and the crashing looked too much like The Simpsons Road Rage,The Simpsons hit & run and Namco's Smashing drive.Spend your money in another place."
1,save your time,This book offers nothing new about mother/daughter relationships or recovery/ rehabilitation ... and the highly mediocre writing style is the icing on the cake.
4,Come Back - What One Mother Did To Save Her Child's Life,"In California, well-meaning legislation passed in the early 1970's led to the situation in which Claire Fontaine had no legal right to force her daughter to stay at home. Running away from home in California is no longer a criminal act, and once your kid leaves, there's not much you can do to bring them home.It is this kind of well-meaning legislation that caused the author to take the most extreme measures possible in order to save the life of her child. This is an extremely interesting and very well-written book that I highly recommend for mothers struggling with teenage daughters."
2,Not Safe for Pregnant Women,"I bought this self tanning lotion because it claims to be safe for pregnant women. It contains DHA, as all self-tanners do, which is known to be unsafe for women in their first trimester...It smells good though....not like other expensive self-tanners.. ."
4,Lots of good stuff here,"What a great 3 cd set for the value. Lots of old club classics here from the old days of vinyl. That being said there is only one song on here that is credited with a 12"" remix version (Sharon Brown ""I Specialize In Love""-which was covered by Expose on their 3rd album.Otherwise all of the songs time in at the 3 to 4 minute range, some more some less. None of the songs segue into each other (not a continuous remix) still the chances of finding all of this old music in one place are slim to none and Disky did a great job of putting it together and the sound quality is very good. Great to listen to these hi-energy classics on my IPOD at the gym!Sidenote:if you are looking for cd's exclusively with 12"" mixes you may want to check out the Grand 12 Inches series also available here on Amazon."
4,Wire in the Blood,"I stumbled on this looking for some more ""Wire"" from HBO. I ordered out of curiosity but it was a nice surprize. Good acting and drama; great mystery."
5,It'll make your day,"This perfect day may well be Ira Levin's most prophetic work. Only Nostradaemus has predicted more of the technology that now weaves itself into our daily existence.Moving from laptop computers to genetic engineering Mr.Levin paints a picture of technology run amok and intent on the complete removal of individuality.""Chips"" determination to push his unconventional values beyond the limits of his known world are an adventure through the realm of self realization, and the consequence of failing to comply with the status quo. Thank goodness we have hero's like ""chip"" who's only goal is to be himself, perhaps life's hardest battle.The struggles are classic, the characters are everyman.There are few books that have the ability to really change the way people think ,this is one book that will."
4,Dystopian 1960s?,"I first read ""Logan's Run"" when I was 14, and I loved it; I first read ""This Perfect Day"" when I was 34, and I adored it. The two are often compared, probably because they were both seen as symptomatic of their time (the late 1960s), but whereas Logan was always destined to outrun his persuers, it was never clear until the very last page of TPD whether Chip would succeed or not. The suspense is impeccable, as is the reasoning (particularly the image of the leaf on the rock...); buy this book now! Demand it be brought back into print, and filmed as well (it worked for Anne Rice). ""Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei led us to this perfect day..."", and I still have nightmares about it now. Fight Uni!"
5,Most people will deny this movie even exists.,"I saw it years ago... Loved it then, and haven't been able to find it since. Was surprised to see it on IMBD & Amazon both, but wasn't a bit surprised to see it wasn't available.If you get a chance to see this movie, DEFINITELY watch it. You will be in the small crowd of about 20 people who can then verify it's just not a weird dream the other 19 had.Seriously...People look at you like you are nuts if you try to explain the movie to them, and they usually will deny it even exists.I just noticed I really didn't talk about the movie: it needs to be seen to be believed. It is, however, very good, and quite funny."
1,la charca,"la trama se enreda demasiado,el autor hace demasiadas descripciones del paisaje,lo cual no viene al caso y cuando terminas de leer la novela,todo sigue enredado,fue una falta de tiempo y dinero para mi el comprar y leer este libro."
3,So So,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014EDX0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis video can be valuable but it depends on the audience. In my case, I was using it to better prepare adults with learning disabilities for an interview. For slower learners, this is probably not the best product for them, although the video is designed in a way that you can fast forward quickly and study specific areas, instead of reviewing the entire video. For those without learning disabilities who are professionals and have reasonable work history and education, this video would be fine. Because of the 'page locator' you can easily review only specific sections if needed."
5,"A Wonderful History of Women, Dance, and Spirituality","What a beautiful compilation! As an academic, I was very pleased with the author's thorough examination of the history of women and dance. It was enlightening -- filled with numerous facts, perspectives, and accounts that I had not come across anywhere else. And the photos/pictures!! This book tells a beautiful story through images and words. Highly recommended."
2,Quite superficial,"I do not want to talk about how the author handled all other ""sacred dances"", but, since I am well-familiar with the Indian classical dance, I do have a clear impression that the author, although apparently quite intellectual, has a very superficial (typical of a western rationalistic mind) idea of what the real classical Indian dance practices are about, and has no idea at all of what is Natya Yoga."
1,Business As Usual,"A manifesto for lower level managers whose principle talent is sniffing out power and serving it. Old wine, new bottles."
3,The end of business as usual,Hard to recommend such a small publication when the entire thing is now available for download at the website.Markets are conversations. This is good.Mass marketing is not a conversation. That is bad.The authors leave themselves open to some fair criticism - their ideas aren't fully developed nor are their any clear suggestions as to implementation. It reads more as a protestation against existing norms than a viable alternative.Find a second-hand copy. It's worth a read but not quite worth the price.
2,Lets throwup on their brain,"Nail the thesis to the church door, unfortunately the four pluperfect authors are still marketing."
1,"Like, duh.","I originally bought this book thinking that it might contain some useful business information. Surprise! It doesn't! Cluetrain Manifesto is nothing more than the ramblings of a number of self-appointed dot-com smart guys who have little or no experience in the real world of profit and loss. As the recent and ongoing dot-com implosion so aptly demonstrates, this balloon -- and this book -- is filled with nothing more than hot air.Don't bother."
4,A double edged sword,"Does the internet and technology empower us personally as well as corporately? Yes it does. Does this book detail a new era in communication and convenience, as well as a new business model? Yes it does. This book puts a positve spin on our current technology, but ignores the other side of the sword. Before we all begin to jump up and down with overzealous enthusiasm, we should explore the dark side of where our future technology will take us."
4,When do the workshops begin?,"Yes, it's wonderful; Yes, it's true. The best thing about this book for me was that it vindicates things I have been saying and feeling for years, and feeling unheard and discounted at best, and ridiculed at worst. Moreover, it says them in an accessible way (for most) with humor and insight. Now you guys have to get out on the road and get those who don't read books into workshop mode so they hear it, too! And let me know when you're ready to do the higher education version, where they're REALLY behind the times."
2,Disappointing,"I started this book with a great deal of anticipation. I expected to find new and challenging ideas. Instead I found only one central theme repeated in every chapter. There are definitely some though-provoking pieces, but on the whole this work feels a bit stale. The work does not feel well researched and did not challenge me. I had to force myself to read the last three chapters."
3,Another Enthusiastic Futurist,"This book makes a strong case for the way the internet changes all the rules. If you're not skeptical yet, you should be. The points are mostly valid, and you need to understand what they're saying, but as with a lot of other futurists (like Negroponte), the authors tend to forget things like gravity, friction, and market share. Visit the web site; save your money."
2,Main idea? Sell goodwill instead of product,"Talk to your customer, ask him what he likes, learn what he thinks of your product, do whatever he tells you, do whatever he tells you, do whatever he tells you. Repeat for 224 pages.The authors forget that a business and its customers are competitors. One wants to minimize what is delivered for a dollar, the other wants to maximize it. Cluetrain in one line? Spend your entire day on service and support, it's not about what's delivered, it's about what people think of you, let your customers wander the factory floor. ""Make everyone happy-happy, okie-dokie?""The one nugget I took away: create forums (i.e. newsgroups on web) to allow customers to talk to one another; any impact on ""corporate image"" will be repaid by discovering problems while your customers are still yours."
2,Conversations,"Like the internet age of knowledge management, one needs to data mine for gems in this collection of writings. Their ideas on conversations may be a little too radical for most organisations and persons."
2,Too hard,"These inserts were too hard and made my feet hurt. May work for some, but did nothing for me."
5,Perfect Length,"I had bought the full length insoles and love them. However they were a little long for certain shoes. Rather than cut them, I discovered that Spenco had the 3/4 length version. I bought them and put them in my work shoes. I love these as much as the full length. I recommend these. They offer all the support of the full length but they fit all shoes."
1,WRONG ITEM,I ORDERED FROM 2 DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THNAK GOODNESS I ONLY ORDERED 1 PAIR FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT IN THE WRONG SIZE. I COMPLAINED TO AMAZON BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE. THE OTHER ONES WERE FINE. I'M NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. PROBABLY WON'T ORDER THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE COMPANY AND THEY DIDN'T SEND A RECEIPT OR PACKING SLIP OR ANY PAPERWORK IN THE3 PACKAGE.
2,"They seem to work for a little while, and then the pain returns.","I've been walking constantly @ 1.5mph for 8-10 hours a day at a treadmill desk for the past week and my heels have been killing me as I have flat feet and have developed a lovely wicked case of plantar fasciitis.Thought these would be the ticket, and for the first couple hours I use them everyday, they are. A marked drop in discomfort levels! However, after a couple of miles/hours, the heat generated by my feet seems to cause even these highly rated orthotics to fail. When I stop to check them, they are very warm to the touch and give and bend easily making them pretty much useless for the longer term arch support I need.Disappointed and needing a new fix, soon."
3,perfect for a fallen arch/Plantar fac.,I was pleased with how well they fit into my shoes and are working to correct my problem feet. They were well worth the money and do cost a lot less than the prescription pair I bought a few years back.
5,Best single book on Esperanto,"If you've already started studying Esperanto, you probably have a textbook like ""Teach Yourself Esperanto"" and a dictionary like ""Teach Yourself Esperanto Dictionary"" by J. C. Wells. But, if you're new to Esperanto, and just wanting to learn more about it and perhaps get started on grammar and vocabulary, then you can't beat Esperanto: Learning and Using the International Language.If not available through Amazon, it's always easy to get this book from ELNA, the national Esperanto organization."
2,Very disappointing...desperate for a good beginners c#,It was frustrating from the first set of codes i tried to follow.The beginning of the book indicated that it was also written for begining programmers but totally lacked basic instructions and explanations.
2,These break REALLY easily,"I bought these and it was a big mistake. I needed a 2.5mm bit to install some Blum drawer slides (it was Blum's specification) and wanted to avoid the solution most other companies were offering, using a 3/32"" bit, which is slightly smaller. That said, these bits broke immediately. One broke while I was tightening the chuck. The other broke on the second hole I drilled. I switched to the 3/32"" inch, drilled dozens of holes without a problem, and the drawer slides still work perfectly. Perhaps these bits aren't designed to be used with a hand-held drill, I can't really tell, but I really regret buying these. I'm not only out the $20+ I spent for 2 bits, I'm out the time I spent waiting for these to arrive."
2,Lacked Originality and Believability,"I'm surprised that the ratings for this movie were so high and think they result mainly from the subject matter and the audience feeling sorry for the two main characters. Though it had its moments, to me it was more like the cheesy, low-budget after school specials I remember as a kid, and it lacked originality and believability. What's more, it had a predictable ending. Stevenson Robertson did a convincing job, but his overdone and overly loud voice grated on my nerves as did the way that his friend interpreted everything he said. Yet in some important scenes, the actors' voices could barely be heard, such as the scene where the doctor is talking to Robertson near the end about his friend's condition. I had to replay that section several times but still couldn't hear all she said."
3,probably great... but came broke,"I got this for our ski trip. It's very light, easy to carry and my kids will probably love it. But it came cracked and we are returning it. Hope the next one is in good condition."
4,Review,"A little smaller than I thought it would be, but my Grandson will have fun with his Dad and Mom pulling him on it."
3,Tips over too easily,"Tough to pull your little one and turn corners in this sled... it tips over every time no matter how slow you go. You really have to make wide turns to avoid this. And, yes, the cord is too short even for me and I am only 5'2"". My poor 6'2"" husband gets a backache every time he has to pull it around.Also... what gives with this new $70 price tag???? I think we got this thing for less than $12 a year ago. Silly."
4,Go For It,"This book is easy to read and clear in its thinking. Like many thoughtful books, what Rabbi Shmuley says seems very obvious, but so is a wheel - after you've seen one. His 10 conversations, while obvious, for me were thought provoking. It's a good book, buy it, read it, and pass it on to your ""significant other"" and children."
5,10 conversations,"Great book, really helps you get perspective on what kind of people you want your kids to be. I liked it because it reinforced my own beliefs and helped articulate some thoughts I had about parenting.10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children"
4,A Strange and Beautiful Book,"I've never read a novel which passed between the mundane and the bizarre so easily. Once I accepted that a magical sheep with a star on its fleece could become an obsession to an absolutely normal lead character, I stepped into a world where anything could happen. And Murakami does not disappoint. And he never over-explains, either. The story is told simply, refreshingly bereft of any self-agonizing characters or deep dissection of events. The plot unfolds and the reader is left with absorbing its odd contents and memorable characters. Overall, a beautiful, reality-suspending novel written with a light touch."
2,urghs,The most boring book I've read of Murakami. The description of things and sceneries are too long. And everything just pisses me off.
4,A good introduction to Murakami's surreal works.,If you love Norwegian Wood (or similar Murakami novels) this is a good introduction to his more surreal stuff... not too bizarre until the last handful of chapters.
4,Donny Darko meets paper...throw in a sheep,"I will have to admit Murakami's more famous books ""Hardboiled.."" and ""Wind up bird Chronicles"" did not float my boat, although I agree he is no doubt talented and a gifted writer of vivid imagery and twisted plots. I must however give him due credit here for this book, the first Murakami book I read, though I'm not sure I would read it again if that makes sense. I think I was uncomfortable the whole time I read this book, but perhaps you will love it.This book is pure entertainment. The reader will be quickly immersed in a trippy, nightmarish wonderland of modern Japan. Perhaps its comparable to Alice in wonderland where ""Alice"" is a middle-aged Japanese man and ""Wonderland"" encompasses an acid-trip OD of neverending hallucinations, mysteries, and metaphors you probably won't understand. Throw in a sheep-man in the place of the cheshire cat. It's a bit graphic, but hell, its Murakami, what do you expect?"
2,Decent beginning with worst ending i've ever read,"I am not sure if most of the reviews here are from the authors friends but this book wasn't very good. Maybe there is some meaning or some existential stuff at the end but the end was just plain confusing. I don't want to spoil it if you do want to read it based on other reviews but when I read the conclusion I was thinking ""What the !@@#$"". What sucks is it builds up a big mystery and then goes off on the most incredible useless tangent I can think of. Maybe I just don't understand it but if you are looking for something to read that doesn't require a degree in philosophy then I don't recommend this book."
3,a lil bit country a lil bit rock'nroll,"this is one of those strange books where it's easier to keep reading than it is to put it down, though you're not quite sure which you would rather do. i finished it in about four days which is fast for me but i definitely preferred norwegian wood to this, i think because the characters had more depth and less time was spent in the fantastic realm. i rate it pg for pretty good."
3,Aerodynamics Basics,"I have just finished my review of Milne-Thomson's Theoretical Aerodynamics. I find the book good as a primer for the basic skills and knowledge an aeronautical engineer needs to build on.While the field of aerodynamics move to specializations such as CFD, a good grounding in the basics is required to ensure CFD codes are furnishing the results wanted by the engineer. I encourage every aerodynamicist to purchase a copy of this book for his library and refer to it from time-to-time."
2,Save your money,"As a Construction Superintendent I previously used the sixth edition and was looking forward to the new 10th Edition. What a disapointment. Much of the useful text has been replaced with useless dimensions for every type of furniture imaginable. Many chapters have been stripped down to brief over views, and turned into ""that's what this is called"" details.If that's the type of book your looking for there are many other less expensive options out there.If you need serious details, try some of the previous editions since the means and methods of construction don't change significantly. You may find some of the newer materials aren't included in previous editions, however, what good is it to you if the 10th Edition only shows you a cross section of the material."
1,Verbatim let me down,"I've been using Verbatim dvd's for years. Out of a few hundred burned DVD's I don't think I totaled more than 3 or 4 that failed. That being said, this is the first time I've tried the digital movie spindle, and I have had 4 failures out of ten tries so far. I could get a 100 dvd spindle of a knock off brand at a discount wholesale store for that kind of success rate. I'm really surprised that this dvd is failing so often with my less than a year old asus dvd burner in my desktop and my laptop that I got for school last year."
2,Info-tainment!!!,"[We are a non-profit group just out to help avid readers like ourselves get the best for their buck. Book opinions tested on college level students.]Advantages of this book are: It is small. Quick to read. Easy to follow. Print easy on eyes. On good quality starched paper. Inexpensive.Nice pleasant reading. And because it's so cheap why not get one.Unfortunately, Ace ANY Test didn't pass our test on profound usefulness so we gave it one thumb up because in our opinion: *It is not geared for levels above SAT - a fact not mentioned on the cover (how could one book ever cover grade school to PhD adequately in 96 pages?). *The content is flippant cliche, ie, reams of COMMON sense OBVIOUS pointers but where's the nitty gritty stuff that shows a real in-depth knowledge of what students go through.So in summary... Ron, we think we liked you better with our burgers and french fries :)"
5,Excellent cinematic thriller!!,"I think Bruce Jones is a terrific writer. I just recently ran across a hardcover version of this book, and I loved it. I'd already read his movels GAME RUNNING, IN DEEP, and SPRINTER, plus I found out he also publishes under the name of Bruce Elliot and so I read his two Touch Benson books under that name as well. This book doesn't have a sequel, but it should. Chris and Matty are great characters, and the book never stops! Jones is just a better writer than he needs to be. I'd love to see this as a movie!"
4,This is a really good book for people of all ages.,"This book is about war and amazing brave boys,who both put their lifes on the line to save their contry.The main characters in this book are Charlie,Tommo,Big Joe,Molly and Mrs Peaceful.But Private Peaceful it not all about war also in this book is romance and lots of friendship.Private Peaceful has won an Blue peter book of the YEAR!My favorite part of this book iswhen a girl called Molly says that she will call her baby Tommoafter his brave uncle.Charlie and Tommo are two brothers who are brave enough to join the army and then fight in the first world war.I like this book as at the start it shows when their younger.At the end their in their teens.If you hve read Cool by Micheal Morpurgo you will like Happy Reading!!(...)"
3,6 deck card shuffler,"Its very fast, however cards get jabbed and or get turned and require stopping and clearing before shuffling can start again."
3,Not a 6 deck card shuffler,"This is not a 6 deck card shuffler...Although the box has an aftermarket sticker on it saying it is a 6 deck, and the online catalog picture is that of a 6 deck, it is only a two deck card shuffler.It works ok if you use light-weight cards that are not bent.I have not used it enough to speak to its durability."
5,card shuffler,"We bought this card shuffler because we had just learned how to play ""hand & foot"" which is a variation of the game canasta but it takes multiple decks of cards and it was difficult to get them all shuffled consistently. This handy little device worked perfectly and is a great conversation piece too!"
3,6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,Good product but cards still get stuck now and then. Adds a little fun to the evening when friends come to visit.
2,Poor quality,The piece that holds level the cards that have been shuffled broke so that it was lopsided after only a couple of weeks. Now it has been four months and the shuffler no longer works very well. Very disappointed. Wonder if it is how the shipper packs them.
1,The shack is all that's back (the actors and laughs aren't),"This Movie is terrible. The first one was so funny it didn't need a plot. The actors were what made it a classic. The script was great, too. This is terrible. This is an insult to the Care Bears movie. What a dissapointment. This really isn't a sequel, just a bad movie that only Disney Channel would want. The DVD is in full screen with no special features (Not that you'd care, anyway). This is a waste of money. You be your own judge."
4,"It's better than good, It's gone!","I'm not to sure why so many people hate this film so much.But i love how people complain that Dan Aykroyd carried on Bill Murray's character.Two different Actors, And Two Different characters,This is also considering the factthat Akroyd was chosen personally by Murray at the time for this role.I simply loved this film for many reasons But i'll name three.1.Aykroyd and Chevy Chase.2.Simple comedy between Characters.3.The Gopher is back with a Furry Twinkie stealing vengeance.All in all, I feel it's a shame people didn't give this movie a chance.I simply loved it all the way through and will forever. It doesn't take much for me to laugh,This is why i loved it so much, Simple is the key,But i'll bet the same idiots that hated this movie PRAISED The Hangover,Get a life you pathetic humorless Cretens."
2,Wrappers are NOT what you're looking for!,"If you want to tell your boss you've mastered the Direct3D engine, just DON'T DO THAT!But you're free to tell him that you have a great knowledge with the wrapper classes the author wrote!And I'm sure that's NOT what you're looking for.However, using the author's wrapper classes is very clear and straight forward, and you may get to know some of the fundmentals of 3D graphics and Direct3D.Anyway, you won't get much informatin about the real world of Direct3D!!! And that's just too bad!!"
1,Title should be: How to use Nigel Thompson's 3D API,This book is laughable! The level of detail covered on Direct3D is almost non-existant. 80% of the book is dedicated Nigel Thompson's wrapper classes that essentially strip the book of content that could be covering Direct3D. If you want to learn Direct3D - I suggest you look elsewhere
2,Not worth the read unless you are a History Fanatic,"I couldn't get through this book because I found the characters uninteresting. Unlike Myra Breckenridge, which I couldn't put down and finished in two days. This one, though filled with facts regarding this time period, was boring. The characters are not interesting enough to hold you, and the history of the events clouds the motivations of all that are involved in the story. Read Myra Breckenridge, or his other books. Some other reviewers said Burr was fantastic."
4,It will built up your interest in 19th century baseball,"I'm not the type of person who reads fiction or novels. But I like baseball, and I thought I could try a baseball novel.Right off the bat, this is a very nice work about 19th century baseball. If you wish to know what was it like to be a baseball player when the game turned from amateur status to pro, this novel will show you exactly how it was. Even if I know my baseball history very well, the book made a strong impression on me, regarding the lifes and time of Asa Brainard, George Wright, Andrew Leonard and so on...The story around Sam Fowler, a reporter taken back in time against his will, his also very good. It is well written, and your interest will built up pages after pages.Bottom line, if you like fiction, time-travel and baseball, this book was written for you."
4,What Happened at midnight,"What happened at midnight is a hardy boys mystery. It is about the two hardy bothers, Frank and Joe. They are trying to catch some smugglers. The smugglers are trying to get a secret inventiion that a man named Malcolm Wright made. The hardy boys realize that the smugglers are rough and mean. They are not as easy to catch as the other thieves they have caught before. Frank and Joe have many adventures and prolems. Joe gets kidnapped and Frank almost gets hit in the head by an anchor.This book is really good because its full of adventure and mystery. This is one of the best books in the hardy boys series"
5,great gift,bought these for our 3rd grade nephew who is a fan of the series- he loved this book to add to his collection.
5,Shut Up & See This Film,"I saw this almost a year ago on VOD, COMCAST cable was showing it. It was a remarkable funny film about a Young Man losing himself after his wife died from a accident in Rome as I recall.It is very entertaining and I am looking forward to seeing this film coming out on DVD. I give it all stars for both originality and entertaining.Bravo!"
5,You Can Change the World!!!,"I read this book as a teenager and found it most inspiring. Although I am from a minority culture, I learned from Father Keller that each one of us is capable of making a difference in the world even though it may be a small difference. I decided as a teenager that I would do this. Father Keller's advice was simple yet convincing. I especially like that chapter entitled ""Everything's all right in Kokomo."" I would recommend this book to everyone but especially to those who may think that they have nothing to give. After reading this, you will conclude that you do!"
5,Barrage,A very energetic group of young people that are absolutely phenominal musicians. I am very happily surprised with the enthusiasm of the musicians and the wide selection of different music types. Waiting for thier next release.
5,Holst's Planets really shine,"This is but one of many incarnations of the same set of performances of Holst's Planets by one of the greatest interpreters of English music ever Vernon Handley . The playing is sharp, the recording is demonstration class, and the music recommends itself. Nothing is taken for granted.There must be two dozen recordings of Holst's masterpiece by now but none does it greater justice than this one, and I've heard virtually all of them.Originally recorded for the RPO's own label by Tring International over a decade ago. the same performance now turns up in at least a half dozen other releases. The packaging here is superior.Don't let the price fool you. This performance is as good as it gets. The bonus of Holst's St. Paul Suite is really luscious icing on a very rich but exquisite cake.A fine memorial to a musician recently departed."
5,Future trip to Antarctica,My friend and I are off on an adventure to Antarctica in February and this book offered by Lonely Planet and authored by Jeff Rubin has been very informative and helpful in many aspects. I purchase all my travel books printed by Lonely Planet.
3,Soft Toy,The burger and fries are small and soft. There is a magnet that attaches the ingredients together. Not very realistic but educational and fun. The only thing realistic is the carton the fries came in.
4,"Good, but a hard read.","If you are very well versed in Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism, this is a great book. But it's not for the casual reader. It's a hard read. But for someone with a good Buddhist background, this is a must-read. I did, however, has a problem with some of the guidelines laid down in the book. I felt they were not the true teachings that I have come to learn about Buddhism. For example, in the teaching about sexuality, it admonished men that it was okay to hire a prostitute. I didn't think that was an especially enlightened admonishment. Furthermore, it totally ignored how a woman should behave. This is quite a turn off as it is one reason many women turn off of all religions. It also didn't allow tolerance for other traditions. This goes against everything I hear HH The Dalai Lama speak about. So I did have some problems with the text and I'm not sure how true to the traditional oral tradition of Tibetan Buddhism it remains. I would welcome other thoughts on this."
4,I like it because the quality of book is higher than my expectation and the price is also reasonable,I give this rating because the quality is very good. I ordered this book because it required for my class but I love to read the stories in this book.
5,as good as it gets,This album is as good as it gets . I enjoy jazz music immensely and this album is a favorite of mine. The playing is top deck and the arrangements are well done.I like and collect the Village Vanguard recordings. This one of my favorites
5,Dc Beanie,This Dc Big Star Beanie looks just the way I thought it would. The description was true to form and We were very pleased with the product and the speedy delivery. Thank you.
3,Reggae Brothers Box Set,"Three discs. 46,46,58 min. each approximately. Sound is good to fine for recordings from this era. This is a companion set to the Trojan Reggae Sisters box set released a while ago. The vast number of tracks are from the late sixties to the mid-seventies. As such, the styles of music range from rocksteady to roots to a smoother romantic sound. Artists like Desmond Dekker,Delroy Wilson, Jimmy Cliff and Horace Andy are here,as well as other well-known and lesser singers. This is music that would have been played in the dancehall for an eager public to enjoy. This is not something I would put at the top of the list for purchase,but it's certainly an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. Nothing heavy here,just good music from the dancehall."
5,Made for a GREAT Halloween costume,Last year I went to a Halloween party dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. I carried this basket with wolf head and EVERYONE commented on it. It's a lot of fun!
3,Complete money investing guide book,It's not as helpful as I hoped it would be. I felt more like I was in a history class
4,"I really like Chapters 15, 20, and 21","I'm surprised that many of the reviewers only see this as an informercial for Investor's Business Daily (IBD). No doubt much of the book discusses how to interpret content of IBD, but there are useful buy and sell criteria. This book clearly contains a condensed version of information from How to Make Money in Stocks (a previous O'Neil book) Chapter 15 is especially useful. If you do buy this book, make sure that you sign up for your 2 FREE weeks of IBD."
3,"Good advice, stop trying to sell stuff!","The book wasn't the easiest to read, but it gave good ideas for investors to keep in mind when selecting stocks and great tips for when to buy and sell. However the book was overwhelmed with constant advertising for Investors Business Daily. A good third of the book talked about the features of Investors Business Daily and how they could be used with the book. There was a some great info in this book, but the constant references to the magazine were annoying."
1,A disgraceful treatment to one of my favorites.,"I only have myself to blame, as there have been several negative reviews on other sites that I should have read before ordering. This could be the shoddiest transfer to Blu-ray that exists! Color is washed out and just plain ugly. It's an improvement over the DVD I bought years ago for $4.00, but that's like comparing dog crap to a road apple. Avoid avoid, avoid!!! (At least wait for a BIG price drop.)"
1,Worst Transfer in Recorded History,Nothing equals the dereliction of those who transferred this masterpiece into a monstrosity. Audio cacophony is coupled with video distortion. Even my dog raised his leg over this DVD to show his disdain. Caveat emptor! This DVD deserves a ZERO!
1,HELP,"Dear Fellow Viewers:I intend to buy the Alpha offering of DVD One Eyed Jacks but don't know if the quality is good. I have read the DVD reviews with conflicting comments from good to bad. Since there are three versions being sold out there, I just want to know if the Alpha product is the good one being emulated or the bad one being lambasted."
1,one-eyed jacks (blue ray),Shame on the makers of this blue ray DVD. Why would they dare release a lousy copy of this excellent Western
3,There are good DVD transfers out there,"A number of reviewers have complained about the lousy transfers that have been made to DVD of ""One Eyed Jacks."" I found a transfer that, while not perfect, appears to be a lot better than what has been described by reviewers here at Amazon. The film was released on Front Row Video, which is a fairly typical, low budget, ""public domain"" releasing company. I was surprised to find that their copy has been released in the widescreen format and that the source print is in relatively good shape. The print is the full 141 minute version. There are no extras on the DVD save some chapter breaks which are incorrectly listed both on the DVD case and the DVD itself. Amazon would do well to seek out this copy from Front Row (no, I don't work for them). It's certainly not the definitive DVD release of this Western, but it's a lot better than what has been described by many of the viewers."
1,Poor French DVD Copy,"I was hoping against hope that this BR release would show the 16x9 widescreen with black bars in true BR format. Alas, it turns out to be a German vendor rip of a French dvd copy. The quality is poor, certainly does not display BR standard imagery. Again Amazon has failed to screen the product for an accurate assessment of what the customer is buying. This happened to Amazon's offer of ""The Warlord"" with Charlton Heston and now this. The rush by some vendors to put a BR label on an old DVD copy is dishonest, and Amazon should take better care to protect its customers from faulty products or dishonest claims from vendors."
4,A Marlon Brando Directed Western Classic!,"This is the one and only Marlon Brando directed movie that was actually damned good. Karl Malden plays his partner in crime who screws Marlon over after a bank robbery, forcing Marlon to spen hard time in a Mexican prison.They say that revenge is a dish best served cold.Marlon brando proves it here - in spades!Or in Wild one-eyed Jacks."
3,Looks better than I expected,I was about to purchase the Blu Ray version but was dissapointed in the review and one man wrote that this version was still the best. It is widescreen and the image is sharpe and the colors are pretty good. At 4 dollars I could not go wrong. I dont know of any other western that has the ocean featured like this with the crashing waves etc. Wonderful. I dont have a 1080p tv yet but until Paramount gets off of their cheap ass and does a proper job of it this will have to do. I love this movie and my dad did as well and the theme music that runs thru it is fantastic. I am assuming that this was taken from the LaserDisc like some of the others but we need to get the full blown restoration. This is well worth the price and is the TGG Direct version.The main menu has a chapter list but I could not get it past 4 chapters on screen. You can jump to more than those 4 but it only shows 4?? Not a big deal really.
2,Very Dissapointing,"I was a big fan of Alien Ant Farm's first cd. Smooth Criminal basically got them to where they are today. The songs were catchy and they seemed pretty talented as a band. I heard about their new cd coming out, so I rushed over to the cd store and bought it. I was SO dissapointed in it. I didn't think they even sounded like the band they were on their first cd. The only song on it that is good is ""these days"". Maybe the bus crash has something to do with it, who knows. All i know is that this cd was a total dissapointment to me."
3,its ok,"the first 5 tracks are really good then the rest kind of [stink] except the last two songs, ..."
3,"Good, but not another ANThology","I love AAF and I bought this expecting another hit with ANTthology. The Cd has a completely different sound than ANThology. Some songs are really weird and sound nothing like the original alternitive sound in their first CD. Its worth listening too, maybe even picking up, but DO NOT expect anything like ANThology. You will be dissapointed."
2,Not a fan! Too bulky,"From the picture, this looked much more of a finer yarn than it is. It turned out bulky and unuseable and was not soft at all. Disappointed."
3,Pretty Cool,"Not a bad Sci-Fi Channel Film. They never release a big hit and maybe never will. Boa Vs Python is a merging of the Boa and Python Films and it does and OK job with an original script and mediocre acting. the best part is the bad characters Girlfriend, can you say ""Hot"" and david hewlett(stargate atlantis). The FX are better than most of thier films and the ending is a little dry. but OK."
2,not awful but definetly good,"this film was pretty lousy and boring. some big game hunter guy or something has this guy gets one of the snakes the python and is going 2 release it somewhere so he can hunt it. but of course them snake gets loose. wat a surprise. so he finds out it got away and he and some other people go hunting it. then their is another group of people trying to catch it as well and kill it. one of the other persons has a 100 foot boa at his little aquaium or something and they let it go to try and catch the python. but the boa starts mating with the python and they become friends and start eating all the people. but the start to fight each other when the python eats 1 of the eggs. there was 1 good thing though, the blond was very interesting to look at and thts rely the only reason i stuck around to watch this movie. this movie rely had no plot and bad acting and horrible cgi effects. dont waist ur time watching this movie."
3,"Great when it works, but hazardous installation possibilities","Installation was quick and easy. But somehow, I did not seat the plastic tubing in the fitting properly and later that night (bad things always happen when you're not there!) the input line popped out and the entire kitchen and nook were under water.I reinstalled the system with greater care (and performed major house repairs) and it has worked fine for five years. I does no major filtration, but the water in the cubes and dispenser are good. Works for us. The refer. has one built in, but it costs $60 to change out yearly, or more often. I'll take the GE. Wish the fittings were a bit more secure, though!"
4,Very detailed,"The SAN Essentials book was very detail oriented and serves as a great way to learn SAN Architecture. Some of the technology is a little dated, but the basic fundamentals of SAN architecture and how to build one are explained very well. This book serves as a baseline for further reading and research."
1,Pathetic,"Took forever to get here, tracking number didn't work. I should have spent the extra $15 and went to the bookstore. Absolutely pathetic."
1,I didn't receive my book.,"I did not receive my book from this seller, and I am still having difficulty getting someone to refund my order. I would not recommend this seller if you want to get something for your money."
5,"Good tool, but received only one, not two, in the shrink-pack.","This tool works fine one-handed and has good leverage. But I received only one tool in the sealed package. I don't know how to get the other promised tool without returning the single one I received, and the return is just too much bother."
4,"This book is excellent, but buy his dvd, as well.","The book is very thorough and if you want something to review or study if you're away from home this would be an excellent source book. Does a great job of breaking down the exercises for each body group or part. Well written and illustrated, easily understood. But, that said, I find myself watching the Anderson's dvd, rather than the book, and following along. He's a first rate instructor and you can't really go wrong whichever you decide to choose."
5,Great book!,"This is the best book I've ever read about stretching. The book starts off by explaining the importance of stretching and some common over looked areas. Such as back pain due to not stretching you hamstrings. The book then breaks down stretches by body parts. The diagrams not only show the correct way but also show the incorrect ways the stretch is done.But the best part is the routines that the author put together at the end of the book. The author put in common stretching routines for everything from daily stretches to sports, travel, and problem area stretch routines. By far the best book about stretching that I've ever read!"
5,Simplistic & Thorough,"Having worked as a personal trainer, I am always searching for books or manuals which do the best job at explaining health, exercise, (or in this case) stretching, and nutrition. I found this book to be very helpful.There is a lot of information, exactly what I was looking for: a picture book which graphically illustrates stretches as well as which stretches apply to certain sports & other physical activities. This is a must if you are seeking a thorough book on stretching."
5,Great book on stretching for everyone,"This is a great book on stretching. It offers pictures and explanations on every different exercise. Furthermore, it provides a stretching workout for almost every sport and situation. The book's main focus is on dynamic stretching and it doesn't go into different methods that can be more efficient(ex: Propioceptive neuromuscular facilitation), but it remains a great book for all. I am a health care practitionner and I find this book great because it is easy for me to show my patients different workouts for their individual needs!!"
3,A good reference,"This book is a decent reference. If you are an active athelete that trains for a specific sport, you will not find much in here that is earth shattering. If you are someone that just needs to get in shape then this would be a good book for you. The book does cover all of the body. There are no cons to this book. The pros are showing the reader the improper way to stretch, as well as the correct way and the diagrams are very instructive."
5,Doctor recommended!,"I went to my doctor for some help with a pulled muscle from swimming as well as another one from running. My awesome doctor made a copy from this book for me to do at home. Of course I ordered it as soon as I returned home and have used it ever since. It covers all of the activities I care about: running, swimming, biking, skiing, surfing and on and on! A must-have for the active person!"
2,Bruce Lee+Nake Gun-laughs = This,This movie was not funny at all. The jokes were stupid and the only good part was the special effects (and I'm not talking about the cow) Save you time and don't watch Kung Pow.
5,"Never WASN'T Hysterical, Never Won't Be.","""Kung Pow""....... is the funniest movie I've ever seen for a karate spoof! It's like as another movie, only with Steve Oedekerk dubbing all the voices for every character. Not for one second is this movie ever serious about anything. Steve Oedekerk is also the star as The Chosen One. That's his name. It is impossible to describe in words the hilarity of this movie. It's that funny! Highly recommended for a great comedy."
5,This Movie Is So Stupid... It's HILARIOUS!,This movie is really dumb. That's what makes it so funny! People have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy this movie.
3,I Love It,"I absolutely love this movie. No matter how many times I watch it there are just certain parts that never fail to crack me up. But I gave it 3 stars because Im certain there are many people who dont feel the same way about this movie as I do. Granted, you do have to have a certain type of sense of humor to thoroughally enjoy this movie. But if you enjoy rapid fire, non stop randomness in such a manner that makes absolutely no sense at all, this movie is definitely for you.I guess normally in a movie review I would explain the plot, but in this case there is really no point whatsoever. People who watch this movie just watch it for the hilarity and randomness, not for dazzling special effects or an intricate plot. If youre feeling goofy and hanging out with some friends, I recommend this movie."
4,Nothing bad to say.,"Funny movie. I liked it. Different. Wish there would've been a part two. Seen this when I was younger, brings back memories seeing it again."
1,worst movie I have ever seen,"I like Oedekerk, I really do, so I can't really say I don't like or ""get"" his humor. Most of his movies are super! But this movie was so bad I still have flashbacks of sitting through it. Holy God, it was so not funny. It dragged on to the point of making me fall asleep, only to find when I woke that it wasn't over yet and it wasn't funny yet. My husband LIKED this movie. I still tell him he owes me big time for making me sit through this completey asinine, unfunny, tedious excuse for a movie."
5,kung pow enter the fist,"The disk great condition when I received it, but the case was a little sun worn, like it had been sitting in direct sunlight for a couple years. Amazing movie, if you haven't seen it, you're missing out."
5,This movie is terrific,"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. It's an original movie that gets funnier every time you see it. It's exactly like The Big Lebowski, only completely different. :) Buy it!"
5,Laugh fest.,I never in my life though that I would like this movie after seeing the preview. I have about 40 DVDs at home and this movie will be the first comedy I buy on DVD.You have to understand the goal of the director to know how to take the movie.Anyone saying that the movie is not good and that the preview has all the good jokes probably has not seen the movie.I though the preview was showing the only parts of the movie that are NOT good. For example the cow scene was really bad.Please at least rent it.
4,It was a good movie!!,Kung Pow was a REALLY funny movie. Some parts got boring but most of it was good. I think that they did a good job on this movie.
4,Oh the silliness!,"Using footage from the 1976 movie ""Tiger and Crane Fist"", Steve Oedekerk creates a new plot, by inserting new footage and inserting him self in original footage.As serious as the new plot is: about a man who lives his life looking for the evil man who killed his family when he was only a baby, Oedekerk manages to make it an extremely silly and hilarious movie.I remember watching the movie 10 years ago and using it as the source of our silly inside jokes. Watching it again recently, it is still as funny as always, it's a timeless comedy!"
1,Extremely Bad Customer Support,I purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional. Software is very unstable and crashes often. This happends when I want to open a document from a URL. ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up. This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix.Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this. I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response. When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so!!!! Extremely unreliable service. I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products.
1,mediocre program,This is a mediocre hard to use program. If yu fight with it you can accomplish most of what you need. However I would suggest that if you need to do serious work with pdf files and your time is valuable look for a different program such as an Adobe program. If all you need is to convert and combine pdf documents check out pdf995. This program is free (annoying ads offering to upgrade but at least you didn't waste any money) and will do most of what you need. at least check it out first.
5,Christians Can Be Funny Too,"I only discovered Mark Lowry and the Gaither Vocal Band about three months ago. Mark Lowry on Broadway makes you laugh and makes you feel good about being a Christian. The routine on the atheist really expressed the way I feel. ""It takes a lot of faith to be an atheist."" This is expressing your faith in the best way imagineable - looking at yourself and others with humor and understanding."
3,I love this show,"Cowboy bebop is one of my favorite shows out there. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because episodes 17 and 18 on disc 4 didn't work. I've gotten 3 different copies of that disc and those episodes didn't work on all of them, so make sure those episodes work on your set."
5,My favorite One-Shot Anime of ALL time.,"This Anime has to be the best one-shot anime out there, and it is undoubtably my favorite one-shot.Featuring the voice talent of Steve Blum, it can't get much better than that... but it can! This show tellsthe story of the crew of the space Bebop, and bounty hunters.. Its a lot of fun to watch and is packed-fullof action and amazing drama. Moving on to the box itself, its pretty plain, but it is still very awsome, it comeswith a very nice cover art, and six dvds that showcases everyone that is on the bebop. Also the series is 26 episodeswhich imo is the best length for one-shot shows, giving it the right amount of time for the story to be told properly.If you haven't seen this, then you absoloutely HAVE to, if you don't have enough money for this box-setthen purchase the individual singles which are still 10 USD but if you like buying from secondary sellers it could probably totalout to around 20 USD or so. PURCHASE THIS, IT IS AWSOME!"
5,Spike dies in the end!,WARNING: Spoilers! Please read my review at your own risk! This is a really good manga! I hope you enjoy the manga and watch the anime as well.
2,Video quality is disappointing,"I bought this with high expectations of finally having a good source for this fantastic anime series. But I'm very disappointed with the video quality: it shows dot-crawl and rainbowing everywhere. I was expecting the video to be resmastered and professionally cleaned, but all they did was some sharpening and color correction. All it was required to clean the dot-crawl and rainbowing was to recapture the LaserDisks and pass the image through a comb filter, as explained here:[...][...]Thus, being a basic problem with a well documented solution, the presence of those artifacts on this DVD-set image is a great disappointment.The audio quality, in the other hand, is very good, at least."
5,AWESOME.,Epic masterpiece. The sound is well improved and the video hasn't been touched up too much. It still has the same raw feel to the action scenes. Truly one of the greatest series ever.
5,Cowboy Bebop Remix,As others have written -- this is an anime series that you have to see! (In my case for the 2nd time.)
4,title of review,"Pretty much my favorite anime, so who could argue with better sound quality and picture. Although I had to send my first one back due to some bad discs in the package. The second one is fine and I got an exchange with no hassles."
3,Is what I paid for.,"This product had the specified videos, however the presentation of them is overall poor.The case itself smells strongly of burnt plastic.The rim around the disk labels are sticky.The disks are placed in holders that are similar to the Smallville disk holders (page style holders), however in these it looks like you can hold more than one disk per holder when in reality you are limited to one.These are just aesthetic problems however, the disks themselves have great video and audio quality, and are straight to the point."
1,Worst disappointment ever!,"What they have done to the LSL line is a travesty. There is no adventure, no strategy, just mind-numbing mini games that Larry must play. The mini games are boring and stupid. The games on my cell phone are better than these. One of the games involves pressing the arrow keypad in the correct sequence over and over. EG the computer will tell you to press ""Up, down, left right, left, up, left, down, right"" very fast. You must get the sequence right, and then copy several more sequences. Remember ""My Simon""? It's like that. The rest of the mini games are equally bad. Avoid this game at all costs!"
4,"adolescent farce, but enjoyable.",funny slap stick game with kiddy humor everyplace. i still had fun playing though. the price is right so i recommend buying it if you have nothing new to play.
2,not sure,this unit kinda sucks. two piece designs kinda strange. it has a headphone jack on the go gear side and a female end on a 2 foot usb cable but the go gear is so heavy it would break any headphone plug
4,This book rock,"I recommand this book for a newbies in the btech universe. The plot is good and battlemech r good,it's violent too."
1,Bad Blu-Ray Quality,Love Witches of Eastwick and have never seen Practical Magic but the quality of the transfer is crap. This is not Blu-Ray quality. It is barely a step above DVD quality and that is stretching it. Very disappointed. Have not decided if I will return it. At least it's presented in true widescreen. Be wary of buying a disc with two movies on it. They obviously have to sacrifice quality to fit two movies on one disc. This item was inexpensive but still not worth it.
3,Enjoyed Practical Magic - Abhorred Witches of Eastwick.,"I enjoy Practical Magic, but abhorr Witches of Eastwick. These two don't belong on the same disc.While both stories have their inaccuracies about witches, PM is enjoyable entertainment, while W of E is a big mistake. I'm also not a fan of what's-his-name...Nickelson.PM has two great actresses in Weist and Channing, and youthful Bullock and Kidman, all are charming, as are their costars, well chosen for their parts. Delightful settings, wonderfully victorian style house by the sea, lovely coastal town with amusing residents, and of course - love stories too. A good time at the movies.W of E is about hapless would-be witches, dabbling with the devil, who by the way does not exist in witchcraft. Nickelson is his usual sleezy self. Pointless movie.I suggest purchasing Practical Magic 'separately', make some Marguaritas, and settle in for a fun holiday night's viewing."
1,"No Text-to-Speech, No Joy","My review is not about the contents of the book but the specific properties of Amazon's Kindle edition of this book. Put simply, this edition of ""Leave it to Psmith"" has text-to-speech disabled. I bought it specifically so I could have the Kindle read out loud to me while doing other things. Without that feature the Kindle edition is of no use to me. I'm surely not the only one who uses the Kindle in this fashion, so if you, fellow reader, are like me, you will find this edition will not suit your needs."
5,Psmith rocks,"Many Wodehouse devotees seem to feel that Leave It to Psmith is the weakest of the Psmith books--but what does that mean? So it's the worst of the very best. How bad can it be? If you love Wodehouse, you'll love the book. If you love Psmith, you'll presumably be delighted to see his situation apparently ""wrapped up."" If you are unfamiliar with Wodehouse but love the English language, beware: Read Leave it to Psmith (or any other snippet of Wodehouse) and you'll be hooked. Wodehouse is the master of the comic narrative. He is simply the very best. Once you pick him up, you can't put him down until you've read all of him--and then you'll be ready to re-read him.Can a lover of the English language not love Wodehouse and Psmith? As Jeeves would say, the mind boggles."
5,"Great Suspense, Scary Book","Loved this book !! I had read Lehane's first book and enjoyed it, but everyone told me this one was even better. And they were right. Patrick Kenzie an Angie Gennaro are great characters, and Lehane does a good job of developing them above and beyond where they were in ""A Drink Before the War"". The villains in this book are great too, with a terrific ""scare"" factor. At one point Patrick meets with the serial killer, and it seemed like a meeting of two of my favorite mystery/thriller characters: John Corey (Plum Island, Nelson DeMille) and Hannibal Lector. Not that they're copies, just similar people. The gore factor in the book is pretty high, too. Not enough to turn you off, but raw enough to really set a scene for a terrifying conclusion."
4,What a Good Read!,"I like gritty, murder mysteries and this is a good one. Lehane whips-up a real, grim bunch of dudes for this one. I really liked the author's attention to detail. If I have any criticism is that his psychotic-serial killer was a tad to Hannibal Lector-esque and the story was a bit over-plotted."
3,Good but too graphic,"Lehane is a good writer but there was too much violence (hopefully somewhat unrealistic)and he gave some unecessary info on the settings, plots and characters. What I loved most about his book though is... you know how you always want to know more about a character when reading a book, and you feel the writer did not focus enough attention on that character? Well, he did an excellent job on each one of them. I could picture each character and understood their role. It was suspenseful yet predictable for us detective type novels obsessed readers. Try James hadley Chase and you will be able to predict writers like Lehane. Overall he is good and very funny. I had to catch myself a few times on the train from laughing out loud."
4,FANTASTIC!,Can't wait to get the next one! This is a thrilling novel that keeps you guessing right to the end!
1,"Kelp, Quinoa, Adzuki beans, Yeast flakes, Sea veg mix...","I bought this after reading reviews that stated it was a concise book filled with easy recipes for baby and toddler. HOWEVER, NO ONE MENTIONED IT WAS MACROBIOTIC. I am not macrobiotic, rather, I just want to learn to cook natural healthy baby food. I have no problem with eating that way, I just choose not to. I don't want to use kelp, quinoa, adzuki beans,yeast flakes, sea veg mix, agar agar flakes, bragg liquid aminos etc... If these are ingredients you cook with on a regular basis, buy this book! I wish there was a more informative write up by the author describing the book and its philosophies. It would have saved me from buying and subsequently returning the book..."
5,Just a comment,"I haven't read this book yet, but I've read most of the reviews. I realize that these types of ingredients are not always easy to find, but in the case of some, you may be looking too hard. Brown Rice Flour, for example, is listed several times as this mysteriously hard to find ingredient. Take some brown rice, put it in your blender/grinder, blend for 1-2 minutes. You have brown rice flour. Very easy."
5,Simple and helpful with good recipes!,"I wanted to cook my own baby food and this book has helped me with simple recipes that can be more diverse and natural than even the organic brands of stage 1 - 3 foods for infants and later, toddler recipes. Always do what your pediatrician recommends, but Olson provided good guidelines for our baby and lifestyle in recipes within each age range. I cook and live in a big city, so the ingredients were very simple to find and I was already familiar with most of them. It just helped for someone else to have already done the math and combinations for simple baby food recipes. Very pleased!"
4,The Basics,"A good book overall, however, I wanted a little more information. I would recommend buying it in addition to The Petit Appetit by Lisa Barnes."
2,Disappointed,"I will be trading this book asap. Several of the recipes contain ingredients I don't use, such as low sodium soy sauce, miso, and Sea Veg Mix. I am not particularly trusting of additives such as Sea Veg Mix or salty additives such as soy sauce or miso (even in the low sodium form), so that doesn't leave many recipes left in the book for me to use. I recommend instead Better than Peanut Butter and Jelly by Mattare and Muldawer."
1,Very little help or direction,"I was very excited to start feeding my son solids. I bought this book and Super Baby Food. This book is NO comparison to the Super Baby Food book. This book would be a great 3rd or 4th addition to your baby food cookbooks but not a very good starter book. It doesn't explain anything in detail. Compared to the Super Baby Food Book this book is awful. If you want detail and direction for feeding your baby, this is not the book to buy."
1,Don't bother,"I was looking for a cookbook that would offer great, easy recipes for my small children. I was disappointed to find that there were no new ideas for me in here. It was all food pairings and suggestions I could have come up with on my own."
1,Not for the open-minded,"I'll have to admit, I couldn't finish it. He starts from a basic assumption that anything outside of heteronormativity is shameful, that all homosexual actions are rape, and goes downhill from there. I was looking for new information about third genders in ancient societies. This isn't it."
1,You'll likely need to replace this headset...,"The headset that comes with this has one critical flaw where any slightly more than normal pressure will cause it to physically crack redering the headset useless. You need the expansion adaptor to use voice chat of XBox Live, but once this headset breaks you can go buy a generic headset. You can use any of the ones available for telephones with a 2.5mm jack just fine and they are usually more durable as well as often more comfortable!"
2,headset breaks very easily,"After one month the headset broke at the earpiece. Used scotch tape to accomplish a quick repair, will try superglue next. This is clearly a manufacturing/design/material defect. Other than that it works fine."
3,have to buy a new mic tommorrow,ok...i have had this mic for 1 and a half years....after about 6 months the part that holds the mic and headset detached....yes it was an easy fix with cement glue and tape but still....ok and now you cant hear out of the earpiece so i have to keep it speakers but my mic still works....i dont highly reccommend it but its ok...just be careful with it
2,Worthless piece of junk,I only got about four hours of use out of the headset before the plastic piece that holds the earphone on it broke. This thing is a piece of garbage.If you need a headset for Live do yourself a favor and don't buy Microsoft's. If you're just getting onto X-Box Live you'll be better off buying seperate a subscription card and a third party headset than buying the X-Box Live starter kit.
2,Did not like it at all.....,"Crappy headset made for smaller ears. Found out the adapter it came with did not fit the most current wireless/wired controllers due to form factors.....I bought this head set for one reason. Voice Morphing capability but found im better off just buying a turtle beaches tango headset.I would get this for a 10 year old but for serious gamers, this would be a waste of money..... xD I hope this helps"
5,the best album of 2007!,"these two cd's are unbelievably amazing! i thought stripped was pretty good, but after coming back with this cd i was blown away. i think christina does an awesome job doing the whole 50's thing and she can definitely pull it off. this cd is pretty much made for any one that likes music from the 50's with a little bit of pop and hip hop added. some of the slow songs on this cd give me chills, and no other artist out there can compete with her voice. her voice is so powerful. i think this cd is so cute, and by this cd you can tell that she is very much in love with her husband, she talks about him in alot of the songs. overall this cd is fabulous and i recommend it to everyone!!"
4,Take It Back To Basics,"A rather good album by Christina. However, i found that Stripped was better. Highlights on the album include : Disc one: Understand and On Our Way, Disc Two: Welcome, Hurt and Mercy on Me. I think it should've been one CD as both discs have the same basic make up. I love her voice - still as powerful as ever. I think this was a fun and exciting project for her and it shows in many of the songs and interludes. Good album but in future i'd like the modern Christina back. I think Stripped is her best work to date."
2,VERY OVERRATED........,"I just don't get all the praise for this cd. I approached this project very enthusiastically and was very disappointed.Granted, Christina can sing - she has a very powerful voice but I find each song to sound alike and starting with her same range roving wail. It gets old fast.If I heard this cd and didn't know the title, BACK TO BASICS would never have entered my mind. A true homage to the greats of the past this is not. I expected a tour de force selection of more modern turns at old time styles putting Christina's range and ability to use. That this is not.It is a mishmash of songs and now I rarely play it. Also, the song to her fans was very self gratuitous. Should have been so much more."
3,Great album....... outrageous price for vinyl edition,Christina Released a great album but the retail price for this vinyl edition is outrageous. 50 bucks because the album is split into 3 discs and has fancy packaging? Sorry but this is a complete waste of money considering that the packaging is made out of cardboard. I'm sorry but save your money and buy the CD
3,It's okay not what I expected,"I thought it would be more of a blusey jazzy type. I perfer to listen to the real diva's bring it ""back to basics"""
4,Good and soulful,"For someone that never buys pop, I have always respected the fact that Christina can REALLY sing and that along with Mariah Carey makes me veer into the pop world every now and then. I appreciate someone that really knows how to belt out a tune in a sea of wanna be singers. Christina has a lot of soul and for people that think she's like other blonde pop stars they will be pleasantly suprised by the old school soul and r&b sound she has. Her first one was the same way, you thought to yourself... hmmm I didn't expect that. She delivers a smooth album with heck a voice. Not too many others can match her all around talent."
3,Diamonds and Lead,"I agree with others in that I really wanted to like this CD, but it hasn't happend yet.""Ain't No Other Man,"" and ""Candy Man"" are spectacular and as hot as anything Christina has ever done, but so far the rest of the two discs just seem to sit there.If she wants to a retro albumn, why not just cover the best of Etta James or Aretha Franklin. That's where she shines."
4,Wow!!,"When I heard the first single(Aint no other man)I thought it was hot for Christina to take it back old school. Of course this track is hot so I thought the rest of the album would suck. I sampled the album online and was impressed. She has some hiphop tracks on it as well which actually sound hot and Im an owner of alot of Old School hiphop. Nice album Christina, much love for bringing it back to the roots, Jazz,Hip-hop and soul."
3,Not as good as i was hoping for.,"I was really expecting a great follow up from stripped. Had this been 1 cd it probably would have been close, however there are a lot of songs that i find myself skipping over.After a week of listening to it, the songs are starting to grow on me, but there are still a lot that could have been cut off.Its a good cd, but i expected a lot better."
2,Very blah coming from Chrisitina.,"Stripped was a far better cd. As a matter of fact, stripped was an excellent cd. I give her credit for trying to be different, but this cd wasn't her best at all. And I expected better since she had a few years since stripped was released. In that time, I felt she could've done something better. I basically only bought this cd because I am a huge fan of hers and would like to have everything she releases, but luckily I only paid $9.99 for this cd on it's week of release. Unlike the $20.00 I shelled out for stripped a few years back, however it was worth every penny.Now with this cd you get a double disc. In my opinion disc two has a few cute songs on it while disc one is just a waste of time to listen to. However, this is not a freshman album and I expect better than cute songs from Christina. Hopefully she is already in the studio working on the next one and trying to make up for this mediocre cd."
2,Back To What?,"I was intrigued by this concept album and bought it on its strength. I'm sad to say that although there are some fun moments on the album where everything gels nicely, mostly it feels overbloated and surprisingly, a bit directionless.Christina mixes in some old sounds and horns to conjure memories of the past, but never goes far enough. She stops short at conjuring the innocent fun and musicality of teh time. Instead she samples which I find a bit shallow. All the songs definately sound of this era and not of the past. Add in the trite pean to fans ""Thank You"" and the cloying ""The Right Man"" along with ""Save Me FromMyself"" and you begin to see the half-hearted effort in actually paying respect to the past and building upon it.I applaud the idea (and wish it was done more often) but the execution on this album fails to live up to expectations."
2,Not what I was hoping for,Christina Aguilera has the most amazing and powerful voice I have heard in a long time. I was hoping this CD was going to show off her talent for singing jazz. I had thought that this CD was going to have her singing some old tunes. Instead she took old tunes and put her pop twist on them. I would love to hear her sing like she did on the Herbie Hancock CD that came out last year. She was amazing on that CD!!
3,Ummmm.....,"While Christina might have the voice, she needs to ""strip"" herself of the brands she makes herself. The first album, blonde airhead w/a voice, second album--dirrty songstress, and this album--roaring '20s chanteuse. She just needs to be....herself...and focus on the artistry and making ORIGINAL-sounding music. These personas detract from the overall feel of the album, and tend to leave the listener confused. I have to give her kudos for wanting to sing about issues in her life, but I think we've been treated to the ""my father left me...I had a hard knock life..."" creed long enough. Her life must not have been THAT bad, she ended up on the Mickey Mouse Club when she was a pre-teen. Come on, Christina. We know you've got more in you than this. You can do better."
3,Some of his other novels are better,"I have really enjoyed some of Greene's other novels. He has a way of setting up interesting stories and is skilled at developing characters that give you keen insights into human nature. While there are aspects of this novel that are engaging, it overall falls flat as too wooden, too predictable, and too preachy. The novel had a lot of potential and would have been better if it would have been more subtle than what it was. Basically, the message is Americans are arrogant and naive, Brits are wiser and more cynical, and the Vietnam War was wrong. Regardless of whether you agree with those views, in a novel like this it would have been more convincing if it was not so heavy-handed. For all of that, it was still a decent book."
3,Quiet American,The Kindle book was great quality. I did not like the book but that is personal choice. I found the main character quite selfish.
5,One must choose sides,An incredible story. I have read it twice now and it grows on me. It is a love story about Vietnam and the battle of life against historical forces. Greene was incredibly prescient about the unfolding/unraveling of Vietnam and the price both sides pay in Colonial/Imperialistic entanglements. You can read this book just for the wonderful characters and also as a larger allegory. The end notes and articles really help understand the context of the story/ the backdrop and so I suggest buying this edition. You don't have to be a fan of Greene's to enjoy this book or to care about the history of Vietnam. This is a timeless story of cultures clashing and people getting caught up in history and trying to find a place for themselves in difficult times.
2,the quite american,"Graham Green helps me fall asleep. His storys are ascetically pleasing until you think about them. Theroux likes him and I like Theroux, I dont like Green - sorry Paul. Also dont read this book if your planning to go to Vietnam -it wont help."
2,forgettable,"I know I'm supposed to revere this book, but for me a careful reading was insufficient to reveal its merits.""The Quiet American"" is not perceptive enough to be a political novel, not intimate enough to be a romance novel, and not arranged well enough to be a thriller. Heck, Greene (at least here) isn't even enough of a wordsmith to convincingly evoke l'Indochine in the 50's, so it's not even much of a travel book. I found myself doing much of the work in that regard.Obviously, the characters as ""representative"" of their nation's philosophies (the Brit as cynic, the American as idealist, etc.) is well-taken, though I thought the device was heavy-handed and unproductive.Another thing that, I think, had this book rolling on a flat tire was Greene's ""in medias res"" beginning, in which he reveals Pyle's death, etc. Although this intially seemed competent, in retrospect it robbed the rest of the story of whatever interest or suspense it would otherwise have had."
2,Sizing,"Nice enough shirt, however it is cut a little smaller than the Easy Care version from the same manufacturer.Double check the seller's return policy before making the puchase."
4,2013 Elantra GLS and 2012 Santa Fe,A little bit long for the Elantra but not a problem. It is a Perfect fit on the Santa Fe.
4,"Shades of Pelevin, Calvino, Borges ...","Ignacio Padilla writes wonderful ""fables"" with themes of colonialism, politics, adventure, ethnic superiority, personal honor and life in general run amok - entertaining tales showing potential but not yet up to the quality of the masters (Pelevin, Calvino, Borges).However, if you want a chuckle on perfect health or minimal need for sleep Padilla will provoke both thought and laughter. My favorite image is that of paintings ""quite simply wearing away from being looked at so much."" Not even time is reliable in Rhodesia when settlers are afflicted with ""nkalo."" War becomes a calculation of odds - based on authentic vs. imitation weapons. Padilla's story worlds are inventive and amusing but not quite compelling in the manner of Borges or Pelevin. Padilla is clearly an author worth watching in his development."
2,"They're all terrible, people","I wanted to find a good Pride and Prejudice sequel. There are so many of them, I said to myself, surely ONE must be good?No. They're all terrible. I read most of ""Darcy's Story"" (luckily without paying for it!) before I gave up. It does have at least one advantage over most--it's boring. Most of the Austen sequels I've tried have been over-the-top melodramatic, but this one was just dull and plodding. Long scenes directly from P&P; are copied--with a few words from Darcy's perspective added to make the ""story.""If you're going to read bad fanfiction, at least do it for free on the internet. Don't waste your money on this stuff."
1,Zero Stars,"Being a self proclaimed P&P purist, I surprised myself by purchasing this book. I guess I was in humor to give consequence to a book that was slighted by other buyers. What a joke...The book is a badly put together, abridged version of P&P. Darcy's thoughts amount to a few sentences every so often. The rest is lifted directly from the original. I put this on the same level as the most recent film adaptation of the novel - basement level."
3,Another book on Darcy's p.o.v...,"This book was easy to read (with large fonts) and modernized English. However, there were many passages reiterated verbatim from the original Austen ""Pride and Prejudice."" Sometimes the words of Darcy in ""Darcy's Story"" seemed atypical of the Darcy described by J. Austen."
1,I was excited about this book unit I read it.,I was excited about this book because I thought it was going to be something from Julia that was different from the Bridgertons. Which Julia hasn't done in a long time. I agree with the other reviews that her last offerings of the Bridgertons were not very good. But the old Julia books I would sit and read in one sitting. I have had this book so a few weeks and I am still having trouble of finish it.The story doesn't ring true and I couldn't help and think that these plot line are very similar to some of her other books. Enough already of the hunting lodge.If you have never read any of Julia's books try some of her old stuff like Minx or To Catch an Heiress.
4,Lovely Secrets!,"Though I've read this 'series' backwards (Ten Things I Love About You 1st, What Happens in London 2nd and now Secret Diaries) - it didn't interrupt the enjoyment factor of these stories. Each of these novels contain such delightfully likable characters and journeys. It's delightful to find an author that I can count on to provide reliably enjoyable books.Thanks Julia!"
4,I really enjoyed this book,"I enjoyed this book, and I read it in two sittings. Yes, the hot n cold emotions of the guy are very much overdone in today's books and movies. However...it is very real and very well explained. I found the realness of the character's emotions to be very compelling. The thoughts that the herione has are hilarious and enjoyable. I found myself lost in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has way too much on their minds that just wants a pleasant distraction. :)"
3,The weakest Lord in all of England...,"So...I started off loving this book even though the ""hero"" (Turner) was kind of (for a lack of a better word) weak. I instantly connected with Miranda... oh how I love the ugly duckling turned beautiful swan stories...but something happened that threw the book way off track and it never came full circle for me. I have read so many books where the main man went through a great tragedy and never quite moved on until he was faced with the loss of the smartest and the most gorgeous gal in England. Turner just didn't fit the bill and I kept hoping Quinn would man him up a bit, but she never really did. I hate that Miranda didn't get the man that she deserved...I bet that's one thing she'll never right that diary of hers!"
2,Typical Rehashed Romance Novel,"There was absolutely nothing that stood out for me in this novel. I am very disappointed. SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED- How many times does a romance writer have to use the whole, the couple is at a house party routine, gets caught in the rain then has sex in the wood shed...? Then dum dum dum....the heroine gets pregnant. I mean oh my god, that's as predictable as a soap opera. I've come to expect better from Ms. Quinn than this! Shame on her for churning out such crap and expecting us to buy it because it has her name on it. I hate to be this harsh, but really now! This book is so typical, so mundane, so every stereotypical romance scenerio that it is appalling."
4,Ignore the bad reviews,After reviewing the reviews I didn't want to get this book at full price and wasn't sure if I wanted to get it at all. Yet I bought it at the used bookstore and was not disappointed. I couldn't put it down. Ignore the bad reviews and get it.
5,Excellent Book,"I'm ashamed that it took me 50 years before reading this wonderful story. I simply couldn't put it down. I knew her name but only had a vague impression of her work, which is a true poor mark on the schools I attended. This is a story that needs to be told."
2,A Dime A Dozen,"I'll be brutally frank: compared to Jimmy Eat World, the Juliana Theory sounds painfully derivative. I listen to a lot of rock music, and the songs on this album could have appeared on several other bands' discs. There are a few very solid numbers (lead-off ""Into the Dark"", the amazing ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me, Would You Stop?""), but on the whole, this CD has a very strong 'been-there, done-that' feel to it. You can tell that the band members care about their music a great deal, and produced the album with a lot of heart, but it just didn't cut it for me."
2,disappointed,"a couple of the jams rock, but most of it is cookie cutter sound lacking depth. if you want a mix between jimmy eat world and a pop boy band with guitars, this is for you. actually it might be for your 15 year old sister."
2,"Poor quality, not upto the rating at which they are sold at..","I ordered numerous of these items of different gauges and it appeared they put more money into the package to look flashy vs. the quality of the terminals. They were very light weight and by no means were they rated for the gauge wire which they were sold. I'm using these in non-car audio applications, but regardless of the application, none of the monster terminals were rated at what they were sold for. I ended up buying some non-monster terminals and have since thrown these away. They were next to useless.Corey"
2,Not for novice stereo installers,"I imagined these would be very good connectors. I was right in the aspect of the quality. These are very good quality connectors. However, if you don't have the proper type of crimpers needed to crimp these, do not bother. I also tried to use a torch to solder my power wire inside of these with no luck. These are very durable and seem to be of high quality, but just make sure you know what you are getting."
5,brilliant int'l publication - top bullet score on icc,"this book (22 pg's) was issued in Germany by Yucatan press / Randspringer Verlag and was a tremendous success among club chess players. It got a very good review in ""Randspringer"" ISSN 0724-1747 #75 in 1996 on pg. 136, which was well deserved due to it's wide scope of theoretical treatment. Among the 22 game examples it has an analysis part of 4 lines of play.After reading this you will reach 1900 rating on icc in bullet tournaments !The product has high market penetration in Germany."
2,This book drove me nuts,"I think that Cole is trying to explain something big here. The book tackles a lot of big subjects under the heading of ""nothing"" and tries to prove that what Cole refers to as ""nothing"" is really where everything in the universe comes from. And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the ""nothing is everything"" theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited. They may be more concise."
3,Exploring Nothing,"This book has had wonderful and horrible reviews. I will take a middle ground. My main criticism is that it has a certain lack of focus and that some chapters do not correspond to the title. Cole tries to talk about the philosophical Nothing, the physicist's vacuum and the mathematician's zero, mingled with Buddhism. I was tempted to abandon the book after the first few pages feeling betrayed by the subject. Happily, I continued. So, is the book worth reading? Yes. Would the book be a better one with more focus on the main subject? Definitely, yes.I would also appreciate that when the author speaks about ""nothing"", either she uses inverted commas or majuscules.There are also a few errors as when in page 201 she indicates that the acceleration due to Dark Energy revved up in the ""not too distant past"", which, according to astronomers, is about 5 billion years. However, I discovered some new things and read it through in one weekend. There are good analogies and good citations."
1,Sizes are not correct,"I ordered size 7.5 for myself, but didn't fit me at all. My mother in law wears size 6.5 and they fit her perfectly."
3,"Pretty, but not for me","I purchased these to go with my formal dress for hubby's military ball, thinking they were quite pretty. Almost all who commented said how comfy they are. I'm an average width and when tried on, the sides of the peep toe dug into my toes. I couldn't image wearing these for any extended length of time. I know that comfort is to each her own in heels, but these failed to impress me. Also, the fabric was rippled on the backs of each shoe, making the it seem cheaply made. Sadly, these are going back..."
5,Frampton comes alive 25th anniv,"wow great album, they added some songs that were not on the original recording. I'm gonna order another one and keep it sealed.Service was excellent as always."
3,Balls,The Warren Haynes track says the time is 18:20. But when you download it its only 11:45. Why? That's Balls!!
5,All I Really Need Is a Wonderful CD!,"What a wonderful way to sing and celebrate life with your child! Dance, sing and unwind to the best children's CD ever! ""Bossa By The Numbers"" by The Crawdaddies is my favorite. Enjoy!"
5,Guaranteed to put you in a good mood!!,"This is my favorite CD right now; it has been since I bought it more than a month ago. And I'm a grown-up! I love the songs by Ziggy Marley, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Raffi, and (most of all) Cathy and Marcy. All those warm fuzzies *and* your money goes to build safe and enriching play spaces in shelters for homeless families."
1,Subud The Coming New Age of Real;ity,"Like many books written about Subud, this one is ""Subud as seen through the eyes of the author"". Subud is a very individual experience. The ""Subud"" experienced by S Monbaron is not the Subud that I experience. So,readers need to find out if Subud as described by S Monbaron is what it really is by talking to Subud members,and perhaps joining Subud to have their own experience. It's also difficult to tell who Simon Monbaron is writing the book for: Subud members or non-members. His vast disapproval of the Subud organization surely would not attract non-members to come and join! In conclusion,anyone wishing to join Subud should read a variety of books,and then talk to members."
2,Danger!,"I purchased this heater to use in a trailer. While it heated very well, the controls are very vague. After it warmed up, it could not be turned off, and I had to unplug it. Once it cooled down it was fine.A serious design flaw..."
2,Disappointing,"Thought the book was going to be much better because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed. I didn't get a woman slowly losing it, nor did I get much of a mystery. I got a book that didn't seem to go anywhere in a place that was hot and dirty and confining. The descriptions of her immediate environment (people, places, customs)was interesting, but I was hoping for a knock 'em, sock 'em mystery and instead read a slow plod."
4,"It's a book, how can it be bad?","Great shape. No bent corners or anything. Pretty much mint condition. Unfortunately, its still for a class."
2,Not myt favorite C.S. Lewis Book,"Other than a very good portrayal, as Lewis imagines it, of the sort of people who may likely inhabit Heaven or Hell, this book is not very uplifting or enlightening as compared with other of his books I have read (Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity). His doctrinal suppositions, woven together in a fanciful tale of a bus full of visitors to Heaven from Hell, are nonsensical. The whole book reads much like a bad dream, with no clear direction or point, except for the basic premise that human beings ought to love one another and learn to get along together. And, I suppose that is his main point in writing it, although the reader is left to himself to decide that."
3,Didn't quite match the hype....,"As have other reviewers, I did experience grit residue from the stone on my tables and I did find the cork bottom to be way off-center on every coaster. This was not really a surprise. And the ""picture"" on the stone was off center too but again I can live with it. As for the edges scratching the table, that hasn't happened to me yet though the package does warn you about the possibility. No, none of this was surprising. What was surprising was the absorbency or should I say lack of. On every one of my coasters I've found that the condensation from my glasses simply sits on top of the coaster without being absorbed! Over a period of 30 minutes or so the droplets do appear to get absorbed somewhat, but I was expecting a faster response. On a really humid day I could see the condensation from a glass overwhelming the slow absorption of the coaster and the excess spilling onto the table. It's a shame, but these are a bit of a disappointment...."
1,Outraged,"I'm outraged that Amazon is committing this crime against the artist by selling this illegal, bootleg CD. DON'T BUY IT! It's horrible quality anyway, so you're not missing anything."
3,Facts are hard to deal with,"According to the new York Times, about 20% of all American women have been sexually assaulted in their life. Given the stress that soldiers and Marines under fire operate under, I would have expected the percentage of sexual assaults in the military to be much higher than those in civilian life. Had this been a military problem rather than a society problem this would certainly be true. However, this does not appear to be the case. The percentage appears to be identical.While this fact, if the New York Times is correct, does not make these assaults in the military any less troubling, it does put the problem in a more accurate perspective. An American woman is very likely, about 20% of them in fact, to be assaulted by someone that they know whether they are in the military or not."
3,Shocking to see,This is an extremely important issue that I hope get more attention than it currently has. This should be mandatory for all DOD personnel.
5,Excellent cookie cookbook,"This cookbook is written in the old world tradition of our grandmothers or great-grandmothers. The recipes are tried and true, of simple and available ingredients easily put together. The history or background of recipes are given. I found the background of one of my great-grandmother's recipes. I heartily recommend this book for all bakers who enjoy a good read along with readily executed recipes."
2,Fable presented as fact,"I found this tape to be a disappointment. When I saw that it was an A&E; biography, it seemed to me that it would be a learned discussion of the legend of Noah as well as how the legend of the ""Great Flood"" is universal among all ancient cultures.Unfortunately, the discussion is at the level of what would be shown in a church Sunday school class. The story of Noah is presented as if all parts of the fable are established facts, including his incredible knowledge and longevity. There is no dissent regarding the accuracy of his existence or what he supposedly did in his life.If you are a believer in the literal truth of the Christian bible, then you will most certainly enjoy this story. However, if you are on the other side of the fence, then it will most certainly bore you."
4,EVEN I CAN DO THIS!,Finally someone put all the best information in one place. I can really look forward to good for me and good tasting food. At the same time I have an easy way to track the exact number of carbs and fat I've eaten.
1,Buyer Beware!,"You can see the set list in almost any CD store. It's all early unremastered Australian songs. If you want this great earlier material, I suggest, ""Brilliant From Birth"", which contains 63 songs and a great note pamphlet. It's here ..."
2,You can't blame them for trying.,"Their voices frighten me in parts of this album. But songs that are pretty good are Second Hand People, Glass House, I Am The World, and Big Chance. The rest are pretty dull."
5,EXCELLENT! GREATLY STATISFIED!,"everything was there as promised, brackets and screws were perfect length, and shipping was extremely fast. will definitely doing service again, great prices and shipping cost. i was extremely satisfied."
4,Seems to do what it says,"I don't have my own testing lab, of course, but I bought this on the strength of some Consumer Labs testing showing that it's one of the brands known to contain the advertised active ingredient--quite a lot of it, in fact. ...and some of the other brands tested had bonus lead added to the supplement. I hadn't realized that was an option..."
4,funny,"I was attracted to this story because of the unusual protagonist - Samantha Jellicoe, a cat burglar. Sam is hired - through her agent, of course - to retrieve an item from the mansion of Richard Addison. Sam's done her research concerning security, and Addison is out of town. Except that Sam gets caught, and ends up saving Addison's life in an explosion that was supposed to take care of a theft - and Sam - at the same time. Sam goes on the lam, until she decides that the only way to clear her name of a theft she didn't do and find her enemy is to join forces with Addison. Falling in love wasn't part of the plan. A very humorous tale of romantic suspense, with an excellent mystery intertwined. I enjoyed the humor and the mystery."
5,PUT IT ON THE KEEPER SHELF,"It seems like so many historical romance authors are turning to modern romances and some are doing a better job than others. Ms. Enoch is one of those doing better. Rick and Sam are complex characters that catch your interest and hold it. The plot works, the characters work, we have humor, we have sex, we have conflict and the story pulls you in and won't let go. It's one of those books you don't want to end. Fortunately, it won't since Ms. Enoch tells us at the end of this book that another Rick and Sam story is on the way. Can't wait! For a GREAT cat burglar/historical romance, read Connie Brockway's ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT."
5,wonderful movies from amazon,"both are wonderful, the new color and the old black and white. I was extreemley pleased"
1,Save your money,Short and sweet: Don't waste your money on even a used version of this book. If you want to buy a book see some of the recommendations made by other reviewers. Get something for your money.
5,A high quality replacement knive set,"A couple of bucks more than the 15"" Grizzly knive set, but Freud quality is worth it."
3,same thing,my mom made the same thing for my dad only it didnt cost her anything she sewed it before I saw this example(she made it out of an old pair of jeans).By the way its an OUTRAGOUS price. All dickies items are sadly.
3,incohesive writing,"This book suffers from incohesive writing and lacks a clear framework that covers the theme of smart mobs. The sequence of chapters does not provide a progressive build-up of a framework of any sort. Even more, the sequence inside each chapter does not carry the reader towards any defined theme. On one section the author describes teenagers in Finland sending text messages, then he jumps to his meeting with a company executive, then jumps to describing the mobile phone standards in Europe, etc.The only common thread among sections in chapters and among the chapters is the smart mobs theme, obviously, but the author does not break down clearly this central theme into its parts. This makes for a very confusing and bothersome reading."
5,A must read for anyone working with Teens,"A fabulous, well-written book with practical and sound advice for anyone who cares about teens and their sexual and mental health. It's great to get hard, accurate data about what teens are thinking and how to get through to them. Especially helpful are the sections ""Your teen will listen if you say this""."
4,The Mystical and the Mundane,"How does one combine tarot cards, gypsies, Christianity and the most mundane creatures on God's earth -- the English! -- into a rich, complex story, that grabs the imagination? Beats me, or I'd write it myself! Charles Williams, an acquaintance of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, takes the mystic Christian tradition and the most ordinary of events of modern life and fuses them together. This fusion makes the modern reader feel almost cross-eyed while reading this ""spiritual thriller"". I find much of his writing very heavy to slog through, but this is the most accessible of his novellas. It gives a unique, yet orthodox view of Christianity. Reminds me of Charles de Lint, for some reason."
1,Not the real tarot,"Williams maligns the tarot in this book. He does not know much about the tarot. For example, the proper name for card no.1 is the Magician, but he calls it the Juggler.Williams gives evil intent to some of the cards. This is ridiculous. Each card has deep meaning, and none is evil.In the book Henry creates a terrible storm with the cards. Such a thing cannot happen. Novels on magic are fine, as long as they have a genuine occult basis. In contrast to Williams, Dion Fortune wrote excellent occult novels based on a thorough understanding of the subject. To anyone who has studied the tarot, Williams presents a confusing and downright wrong picture of the tarot."
4,Hard to read,"Well, I am not a native english speaker, but even for an english native speaker, it's a very hard reading, due the poetry, metric and ancient words... it is a classic, beauty story, but it's better if you undertand the whole text, I cannot..."
1,Utter drivel,"What should've been a fascinating story of a historical saint becomes in this author's hands total, boring drivel. Do not waste your money."
2,"interesting little stories, in the long going nowhere","Each little scene is often interesting but if you're waiting and hoping that the whole thing comes together and makes some kind of sense, you'll be waiting a long time. For Kosinski, there are better choices..."
1,Disturbingly disappointing.,"I came across a used hardcover and decided to give it a try, having really enjoyed The Painted Bird and Being There. Right away the writing seems somewhat tired and worn, with the same vignette style as The Painted Bird but without the freshness or vigor. It picks up after a while, making you think it will eventually cohere with some twist or another, but it doesn't. The author relies on the shock value of some scenes intended to disturb the reader, but they don't come off as all that impressive -- somewhat stale, especially today with modern understandings of sociology and sexual psychology that incite boredom at Kosinski's numerous revealed dysfunctions. Some of the stories are genuinely compelling, but tainted by a sadistic mind that is not at its most creative. I'm sad to say this is one of the most horrible novels I have ever read."
1,Derangement in the Cockpit,"Few books have made me as irritated as ""Cockpit,"" as Kosinki episodically unravels one nightmare after another. There is just a minimal spine to hold the narrative togther (American spy becomes filthy rich through his manipulation of others), minimal dialogue, and no resolution of character or story line. And to think Kosinki also authored ""Being There"" and was (is) a university professor! Good thing I invested just a dollar at a used-book counter."
1,You Too Can Lose Sleep Tonight!!,"If you enjoy reading unconnected, plotless, sometimes titillating, always depraved vignettes, than this is the book for you. While I enjoyed some of Kosinski's sometimes lush prose, I prefer an interesting plot with at least one admirable character, and so this work rates as the very worst novel I have ever read. That can't be true, can it? I'm thinking. I've read some time-wasters, but no, this is the biggest one of all. Very disturbing as well. The soft cover advertises that 'Tarden is the ""ultimate secret agent"". I see him rather as the ultimate demented mind. Very twisted. Tarden makes ""dysfunctional"" seem like a worthy goal.The jacket promises that ""the silently suffering are quietly rewarded and the unjust are mercifully punished."" Horsehockey. Tarden punishes those who do not do what he requires; and I saw little evidence that anyone is ""quietly rewarded"" except those readers who pass this book up."
3,"Okay but, no Hawthorne Heights","I love how a lot tells me Hawthorne Heights (One of my favorite bands of all time)and all emo sucks but, they would much rather listen to that, than listen to Simple Plan. For me though, this was an okay band to start on when I was very young and just getting into music. After a while it was just starting to get old. So, if you are getting tired of this band then check out HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS, Taking Back Sunday, Silverstein, Thrice and Thursday. Thats where the real art and emotion in music is. I had to give this album 3 stars because I used to really like SP. Then, (Thankfully) a friend made me listen to a Taking Back Thursday album and the rest is history."
5,A New Step in the Simple Plan Adventure,"I think Still Not Getting Any is an excellent disc. It shows a real evolution in the style of music of Simple Plan. The themes of the lyrics are a bit more mature also, dealing with loss, life and society (Crazy). I think No Pads, No Helmets,...Just Balls was also a wonderful CD and Simple Plan achieved doing even better this time. Simple Plan always ruled and will always rule. These guys rock and their two CD are really worth listening to."
1,OO MY GOSH!!!!!,SIMPLE PLAN IS LIKE THE BEST BAND EVER! LIKE THEY HAVE THIS REALLY GREAT SONG CALLED SHUT UP! OOO I WISH I COULD MARRY SIMPLE PLAN! THEY ARE SOOO PUNK COMPARED TO BANDS LIKE CALLED GREEN DAY AND THE CLASH!!!! LIKE SIMPLE PLAN SHOULD LIKE GET A BUNCH OF SHINY AWARDS!!!!!
5,review,"I have gotten a chance to hear simple plans new cd, and it is awesome, but they sing alot of depressing songs tho. All in all a great cd."
1,fred durst is like omg ttyl kewl bff,"will someone tell me why any one over the age of 11 enjoys this crap? please... is it the amazingly untalented guitarists? the over used lyrics, the singer who probably hasn't gone through puberty? or is it the bald guy (what DOES he do?).i just find it sad that there are people (a lot, not just a few)who think this is what punk actually is. if you want punk listen to afi, a wilhelm scream, minor threat, pennywise, anyi-flag, sick of it all, bad religion, anything. just please, not this. dont even take the time to listen to the samples. it really isn't a mystery why most of the review are 1 star. this is possibly the worst thing i have ever heard. still not getting any...never gonna get any. good . im glad. yeah. hip hip hooray"
5,totally getting it all....,"The album is just really good. The last album was great too but it was more punk rock but in the new album they have a different sound. It's still great! My favourite songs are ""Crazy"", ""Perfect Word"", and ""Shut Up"". But the whole alum is really great. The songs actually have a lot of meaning and sense. Not like some songs that are just about some girl that dumped them. Simple Plan sings about eveyrthing. About friendships. Relatinonships. Life. Unfairness. Everything. They are just so great! They really have taken punk rock to a whole new level...I recomment this to all Simple Plan fans and also to people who like punk rock and generally rock bands like Blink 182, Sum 41, Linkin Park or Good Charlotte. So crab it now you won't be dissapointed but you'll become obssesed with Simple Plan and will be playing the album all the day long...all week..I KNOW..i do!"
1,SHUT UP!!!!!,"THIS SO CALLED ""BAND"" HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE! PEOPLE CALL THIS MUSIC? PLEASE! WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THESE WHINERS SERIOUSLY? THEY SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF KINDERGARTENERS COMPLAINING ABOUT BULLIES PUSHING THEM AROUND IN THE PLAYGROUND DURING RECESS! NO WONDER PEOPLE DON'T TAKE CANADIAN MUSIC SERIOUSLY, WE GOT FOOLS LIKE THESE LOSERS GOING AROUND AND MAKING A MOCKERY OUT OF US! DO US ALL A FAVOR BOYS AND STOP MAKING YOUR SO CALLED ""MUSIC"" CAUSE FRANKLY IT SUCKS!"
1,Shallow music at it's best.,"It's amazing how music like this can be so credited and popular even though sp have a large fan base. While on the topic of there fan base, it is worthy to note that this music cannot appeal to ne one ecxcept ppl who are between 13 to 15 yer old. The lyrics are really plain and even an 8 year old could write such stuff which is inspired by small teenage problems such as bad relationships and controlling parents. To be homest i bleve that sp has a decent sound and could really have done much more with there music if they were able to dig deeper and write good inspired songs. I dont think they wud even know some of the more serious problems that most teenagers go thru. Having heard a good amount of this album on my 15 year old sisters cd player i cant say much that wud make sp seem like a good band in general let alone a good punk rock band."
1,trust me,"still not getting any.......because they an awful awful poseur excuse for music. bands like this and good charlotte think that theyre punk if they wear converses and have spiked hair and complain about their girlfriend dumping them. punk has never been about converses and spiked hair......punk isnt a clothing style, its an attitude. and all the attitude simple plan has is that no one can see life through their eyes so they have to complain about it in just about every song on the cd. punk is about rebelion towards authority not about stupid teenage breakups. trust me, if you want to hear real music go for real punk artists like the ramones, the clash, unseen, subhumans, circle jerks, the dickies, the adicts, sex pistols , black flag, the meteors, misfits, the doors, the strokes, uk subs, dead kennedys and so on and so forth."
3,psh.,"i'm tired of so called ""punk listeners"" bashing simple plan. if you were really a fan of punk, you would know that this band isn't actual punk and why would you waste your time listening? i am a fan of music. this wasn't their best work. there were some songs that caught my attention and some that didn't. i'm glad that not all the songs are all about heartbreak and crushes. ""Crazy"" is a good try of bringing the attention of how society is warped into the media. overall, this album is great for pre-teens otherwise don't bother buying this album."
1,G@y??? Garbage,"WTF, I hate Simple Plan. The guitar player is fake and a poser. And the lead singer is definitely g@y, or his voice sounds VERY VERY g@y. I'm sick of g@y bands...avoid this like the plague.UPDATE: I noticed that under the ""customers who bought this bought..."" section, and found Jesse McCartney's ""Beautiful Soul"", and found that Simple Plan is THE PUNKEST PUNK RAWK BAND EVER, EVEN MORE PUNK THAN THE RAMONES, AC/DC, SYSTEM OF A DOWN, AND NINE INCH NAILS...lol, my sarcasm, but seriously, how is Simple Plan ""punk"" if their music related to Jesse McCartney's?"
2,Over and Over Again,"This album has the most repetitive melodies ever. Even in their other album, No pads, No Helmets... Just Balls, the melodies are very similar.The lyrics are very effusive and they aren't deep at all. It's probably best for pre-teens.Nothing stood out to me on this album."
1,Not Sweet.....,"People know that these guys aren't punk and that's not the only reason that they get bashed on the internet or anywhere else for that matter. The thing is, these poppy so called PUNK sell-outs stole the bad boy punk image and took it to the mainstream leaving the punk roots behind. So, if you're a fan of these guys or any other pop singing wussies, please understand why we're so upset........I give this album one star for them trying to look punk, but not actually representing it....."
4,xxxxxxx,"I won't continue the string of how I liked the book, what it meant to me, etc. After reading several reviews, it would serve no purpose. What is interesting is that I just read the book for the second time, at 60, the first time I was 17. That was 1964. Many of the reviews stated that it was required reading in school....I have to laugh. The book was banned reading in my high school, and we risked school punishment if we were caught in possession of _The Catcher in the Rye_.Think about it.....Vietnam was just two years later, and the world changed forever for us. And we were not allowed to read Salinger's book in 1964."
4,This book is deep.,"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that shows the horrors of growing up in America. Adolescense is not easy and Salinger conveys that through this book. It's too bad he's hiding from his supporters, he rocks!"
5,A really good book,"I thought this book was very well written. I don't agree with infidelity, the characters were responsible for the choices they made. I would highly recommend this book, and will read more from this author."
4,An excellent follow-up to an excellent story.,"I don't much care for 2-part stories, in which the first book has no proper ending, and the second book picks up in mid-story, which is why I marked this book (and its predecessor) down to four stars. Additionally, the actual ending was somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic, after having been built up to be a major issue, but that wasn't enough of a drawback to justify marking an otherwise excellent story down to three stars. The writing itself was quite good, the characterizations well-handled, and the action gripping and intense. Mr. Stern shows an excellent touch as a writer, and I look forward to seeing more of his work -- preferably in stand-alone stories."
4,THE BEST JACKIE CHAN MOVIE EVER MADE!; 4.5 STARS,"INSPIRED BY HIS FAILED U.S. MOVIE ''THE PROTECTOR'', JACKIE CHAN PLAYS A COP WHO'S AFTER SOME GANGSTERS AND IS FORCED TO LOOK AFTER A FEMALE WITNESS, IN SPITE OF WHAT HIS JEALOUS GIRLFRIEND THINKS. ASIDE FROM THE BAD DUBBING, THIS MOVIE DOES HAVE ALL OF CHAN'S BEST ACTION SCENES, BEST CAR CHASES, AND SOME OF HIS FUNNIEST MOMENTS. THERE'S NEVER A BAD MOMENT IN THIS CLASSIC FILM. ONLY THING WE NEED NOW IS A DVD RELEASE FOR IT. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS."
2,Irritating Camera Work,"The performance is not bad. The constant second long takes, the endless fascination with the tip of the violin bow, and the swirling round and round in the lights of the Philharmonie in Berlin are a pain to endure. Only towards the sublime finale of this great work does the camera settle down and allow you to experience the music. My copy is off to the second hand store."
2,Here is a challenge: READ BOTH SIDES!!,"I agree with the assessment of one reviewer below: White's book IS both condescending AND evasive! CONDESCENDING in his attitude toward a postion he despises; EVASIVE in his avoidance of the real issue (divine preservation of scripture) in favor of ""noble"" indictments of extreme positions and whacked-out personalities.This book has been found intimidating by many KJV advocates and little wonder- It was WRITTEN to intimidate! Still, I truly believe White really is off base in many of his contentions and conceits.One of White's supporters here speaks nobly of ""thinking for one's self."" Here, then, is my challenge:Go ahead and read White's book-- I did! BUT, if you're REALLY willing to think on your own, ALSO read David Cloud's well-written response, available for on-line viewing at www.wayoflife.org/~dcloud/fbns/examining01.htm and FREE no less.There is the challenge. Take it if you will.ANDY"
3,Can we trust the accuracy of the Bible?,King James Only Controversy brings to light the challenges of Christians today. What is your take on this age old argument? Bible translations both old and new are brought into scrutiny with great debates for both. Which one of the 5 different views do you hold? How do we know that the translation we are currently reading is truly God's Word? Can we trust the accuracy of the Bible?All of these questions are addressed in this second expanded edition of King James Only Controversy.The author states that his desire is to bring peace to Christ's church and quell restless spirits in congregations.This book has many differing views with wonderful commentary and helpful information. What a great reference book for scholars.
5,Highly Recommended Study on the Topic,"This is a detailed study which discusses both sides of the issue. It describes the history of translations leadings up to the KJV. Many specific examples of verses that differ between the KJV and other translations, with explanations on why they differ. Basically a great study on the topic that exposes and strips away the emotion, leaving you with the facts."
4,The Silly Controversy that will not die,"I do not want to enter the raging debate that seems to surround this book and topic. The funny thing is, it is so near and dear to my heart. The timing is also good because I am currently embroiled in the nearly fruitless efforts involved in convincing so many otherwise reasonable people that the KJV is NOT the only Bible to read. I want to thank the author for being so clear and supportive in his narrative. I find him very experienced and reasonably neutral. I honestly have a lot of trouble with the antagonistic attitude of one of the selected 'Negative' opinion reviewers. He referred to the author as condescending. I find him to be anything but that. The author is not being derisive at all. He simply realizes that adhering to a KJV only attitude is dated and misguided as best."
4,Quite a helpful book for the doubting Christian.,"This is a book I've been reading lately, and it respectfully disproves the idea that the King James Version is the only worthwhile translation of the Bible, while offering facts that help Christians trust a majority of the newer translations on the market today. I highly recommend this book, if only for the amazing background information on how the Bible came to be."
5,Excellent - just the facts material,This is an excellent book covering the topic with factual information with lots of references. If you want a book full of facts and references and no emotional attacks this is the book. This can easily but understood by the layman but if you know Greek (even a little) it helps since the author gives examples of side by side variations in Greek.
4,A Very Fair Book...,"Over the years I never really understood the whole King James Version Only controversy. Dr. White puts the controversy in easy to understand language. James White is fair in his assessment, he really didn't much to say that was bad in regards to the KJV in and of itself. You don't have to be a theologian to be able to read this book and understand it. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the KJV Only controversy."
1,Poor arguments,"I've never even met these ""King James Only"" types described, and the ""straw man"" the author set up wasn't too difficult to light a match to."
2,incomplete and no priorities,"Like many such lists of things to do, this book has good information but is incomplete and has no priorities based on what will do the most good in which situations. It is not likely to help many people. Too many books like these entertain people and lead to no action, unfortunately. There are much better books -- by Daniel Chiras, David Johnston & Scott Gibson, John Krigger & Chris Dorsi, and Daniel K. Reif -- to name just a few. Chiras has written quite a few, all very good."
2,The Film's a Five the Print's a Two,"This is my favorite Capra film. I bought it because I never tire of it--that is, until I got this DVD. This film badly needs to be remastered. The picture and sound quality of this DVD are awful. Hopefully, someone will release a better copy. I'll try again when that happens."
4,Poor Quality DVD Damages Great Film Classic,"This is one of Capra's greatest. Along with Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith, John Doe paints a dark satiric picture of the times that tells audiences today what the late Depression years were like economically, socially, politically, and morally. Capra hints at the darker political elements of the times, linking corporate wealth and power with an incipient fascism. Still, after comedy gives way to serious social content and melodrama, in the end right triumphs over cynical might, and Gary Cooper with Barbara Stanwyck's help, one of her more energetic performances, pulls off one of the more unlikely final scenes in all filmdom. But, and this is a major reservation, the DVD version here is one of the poorest technical productions in all DVD-dom. It is a disgrace and a shame and a travesty of a reproduction, especially for such an important film historically."
3,Uneven melodrama,"This Frank Capra film shares many thematic similarities to his masterpiece, ""It's A Wonderful Life."" There is the loss of faith in idealism, the supportive ""true believers"" and even the attempted suicide. However, this movie falls far short of ""Wonderful Life."" The main problem is its uneven tone -- the few comic attempts seem oddly misplaced. Often it attempts to make social commentaries which are far too blatant and far too preachy. Unless you are a serious student of Capra, my suggestion would be to get ""Wonderful Life"" if you don't already have it. This film was perhaps a ""rough draft"" for that work."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD","Apparently, the DVD was made from an old print of the movie that was grainy with washed out blacks. Indeed, I don't believe that there is a single scene in the movie that has a true black even though the movie is in black & white. Regardless of the poor quality of the DVD, the film's fine direction and acting performances make the movie truly enjoyable, especially if you are a Capra fan. Thus I rate this dvd at only three stars overall because of one star dvd quality combined with a five star movie."
1,This made me sad,"What a great movie, but what an awful copy. This copy is almost unwatchable. The transfer is dark, making it hard to watch the movie to the end. It made me sad that I could not share this wonderful movie with my students, but it is unwatchable for all practical purpose."
3,What should I say?,"The Amazon review bot has just recommended this to me, on the basis that I like Borges and Calvino (Calvino's collection of Italian fairy tales in particular), and asked me whether I own it (yes) and how many stars I should award it. How on earth do you reward stars to 'The Republic'? I mean, I don't _like_ The Republic, but 3 stars, which Amazon informs me I should understand to mean 'It's OK', doesn't quite (to put it mildly) fit. I would award three stars to throw-away science fiction of the sort sufficient to divert me during a long train journey, or to a competitor in America's Next Top Model. If The Republic is 'OK', then so is Ayers Rock, or the planet Mars, or Buddhism.In fact, it occurs to me that The Republic is, in its way, science fiction, but we haven't managed to throw it away for two and a half thousand years."
3,The Republic by Plato,"I read ""The Republic"" as a reading assignment for my english class. I thought that a lot of the ideas it covered were insightful and that plato created excellent visual pictures with his speeches. This book did, however, fail to completely answer a lot of the questions that were asked and encourages views that would contradict a lot of christian values. I also had trouble with finding my page in the book and knowing what chapter i was in. It was an ""ok"" read, i guess."
5,God did it!,"This book is great because it offers hope for healing when the docs do not give it to you. After reading and implementing the strategies for my hashimotos thyroiditis, they did not help, but my antibodies actually went up! HOWEVER, I feel the most important strategy he had was not ""accepting"" the disease. The mind is a powerful entity when it comes to healing and researchers are just now discovering how significant a role that our thinking and thoughts play in overcoming disease. I started believing God and not my body or blood test results! God healed me completely. Jesus Christ healed my otherwise ""chronic"" condition. But, I had to have faith and accept His love. He had already paid the price for my healing. I had Hypothyoidism for 15 yrs and I tested negative for antibodies and my TSH is great--I am totally healed by thew grace and love that Jesus Christ freely gave."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. To start, there is not much too it. The main chapters of the book comprise a total of 42 pages. Pages 43-102 are a personal health diary which the reader is supposed to fill in. The remaining pages, all 18 of them, are a conclusion, resources and a chapter about the author.There is very little information in the book that can't be found on most web sights about hypothyroidism. The diagrams, especially of the author's test results, are mostly unreadable. They looked like copies of a fax.I cannot and will not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book about Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, get Mary Shomon's book."
1,If there was a no-star rating this book would earn it,"Almost nothing in this book. Drumroll, please, the author took...co-enzyme Q-10! The author also had nothing like the misery those of us who've had low thyroid for decades have experienced. This book hit the trash can."
2,Painful and Sloppy,"I bought these in gold after owning a different pair of nine west slingbacks. They were terrible and never stayed on my foot! My toes went over the top, they flopped around in the back, and when they were on they were too painful to walk in."
3,Nice shoe fits small,I normally take a size 8 in ninewest shoes however these I found to fit small... I would need a 9. Not that comfy to wear all night. I wore them to my daughters baptism and party after so I was standing all day in them. By the end of the night my feet were very sore... couldn't wait to take them off. But they do look nice!
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I HAD FIRST SEEN THIS MOVIE ON DIRECT TV AND I LOVED IT! AFTER RECORDING IT AND WATCHING TI 3-4 TIMES, I FINALLY DECIDED I HAD TO HAVE IT. I'VE SHARED THIS WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS AND IT IS SO FUN! MY HUSBAND EVEN ENJOYED IT;-) THE ""WICKED"" MOTHER IN LAW AND THE CLASSY BRIDE, THE SARDONIC, UNHAPPY FATHER IN LAW AND THE CHILD HUSBAND. PUT THAT TOGETHER WAS OTHER ASSORTED MALADJUSTED CHARACTERS AND YOU'VE GOT A GOOD TIME! OH! AND THE BAND! JUST THE BEST!"
3,Fun but forgettable,"This film has a good cast, but the best actors, Firth and Scott Thomas(in my opinion), feel somehow underused. It was, nevertheless a fun movie with great costumes, scenery and a relatively satisfying end. I think it should be mentioned that Jessica Bile manages to hold her own among the other more 'accomplished' actors and is cheerfully amusing in her role."
5,"Easy Virtue - a ""wonderful film""!!!!","I completely missed this film when it opened. I also missed it when it first came out on DVD. My sister told me it was wonderful - she was absolutely correct!!! This film is delightful! The soundtrack is great! Jessica Biel did a superb job in this film. Kristin Scott Thomas plays the role of a ""stiff upper-lip English mother-in-law"" with great skill! I recommend this to everyone!!!"
2,Could be better,"While there is some useful info, the vehicle technical data listed were somewhat inconsistent, an unhelpful factor in making comparisons. Armor thickness was inexplicably omitted. Most disappointing was the poor quality of the photo reproductions, with contrast so bad as to make many shots of very limited value to the modeler. Why this would be the case in this age of Photoshop when digital magic fairly easily improves imagery is a mystery. Though many obscure and hard-to-find vehicles are covered, the better-known vehicles are dealt with more fully in plenty of other sources."
5,Great!,"The best and most comprehensive book I've read on Buddhism! I have found other books confusing, but this one was easy to understand. Thank you!"
3,Clarifies misconceptions about Buddhism,"This book intends to clarify misconceptions about Buddhism and many of the ""10,000"" details of the Dharma. However, if the reader wishes to Do Buddhism this is not the first book to read. Check out Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book if you want[...] a step by step introduction to doing Buddhism."
5,Written very well!,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover how helpful this book is in understanding Buddhism, and now I feel that I can better answer others' questions on why I prefer Buddhism to my original religion/philosophy. For some reason, the books written by the Dali Lhama are hard for me to stick with, and they didn't answer my questions about Buddhism. This book, however, takes one common question at a time and clearly answers it - all of my questions were in there, plus a few more. I plan on buying more books about Buddhism by this author."
2,LOW CHARGE,I bought these radios for work thinking we could communicate through an eight hour shift. Not so. I think we had to recharge these every two hours and it took another three hours to charge. I would not recommend these unless you want to talk for two hours or less.
2,Not 15-mile range at all,This two-way radio is far from having a 15-mile range. Apparently all these radios does not have the range that they claim. There are many reviews on different brands telling this.
3,"Great sound, horrible construction","I wear earphones only on my commute to work (an hour in my car) and while walking my dogs. Still, in the first week these earphones fell apart like dollar store rejects. The wire coating pulled apart leaving exposed wires and the plastic components repeatedly came apart. Five days after receiving them, these brand new cans (which sound fantastic, by the way) were covered with electrical tape to protect them and hold them together.I like Altec Lansing enough that I purchased another pair (Backbeat Pro) and am really happy with them, but I would have preferred not having to spend the extra money. As a great a deal as these were, my recommendation is to pass these by."
3,Good but not the best,"I read all the reviews and thought everything would be great especially for the sale price. However, the bass was hardly there and they sound more canny than most headphones. On a good note, they are very comfortable and they block out almost all noise. After the break-in period the sound did improve but it's not what I had expected for a headphone whose original price was over $120. For the money on sale it was a great value!"
1,DO...NOT...BUY,I go through a lot of ear buds every year. I typically love Altec Lansing but these are the worst designed ear buds I could possibly imagine. Looping the cord around your ear? Are you kidding me? I would forgive that if the quality was great...but THAT is even worse. No bass whatsoever. I got these instead of the typical Altec's I usually purchase because they were cheaper (due to a sale and no shipping)...such a horrible decision.
2,not worth it,"I decided to purchase this item based on other reviews, and I even bought the Comply foam ear tips just in case. The only good thing I can say about these earphones is they sound good; otherwise, they don't stay in the ear no matter what I do. Even using the Comply foam ear tips doesn't work. The only way I can get them to stay in the ear is to not move at all. I can't imagine trying to jog or even walk while wearing these. I'd like to send these back but I doubt they'd let me, since they're used."
4,Function over Form,"These are a little awkward to fit into the ear, but once they are in, they stay in. The wire seems a bit thicker than other pairs I've had, because of that, it seems stiff. But overall, the sound is great, they are clear and loud."
3,Decent quality,"The music coming out of these headphones are not bad. However, whenever I plug the headphones into any headphone jack, I always hear feedback from the headphones, and there is always a low ringing in it. I may have gotten a faulty pair, but they're not bad overall.$40 is a pretty good price for these. I bought the foam tips with the headphones and they work better than any of the ones which came with the headphones. I'm extremely afraid, however, to get earwax into the canals since they are so deep."
2,Fooled by M.J.'s Video -- Dead 9 months later,"I watched the video by MJ and bought a pair, ""broke them in"" according to his recommendation, and well, these are just average headphones.-------9 months later, the left pod has died. It's about half the volume of the right one. And yes, I did clean it out."
1,there's a reason for being on sale,"i've never been more excited and then more disappointed than I was with these headphones.thought i was getting a steal.1 - they are too heavy for earbuds, so you can't run, walk, or do anything else moving while wearing them.2 - sound quality was weak, zero bass3 - shape and cord is awkward.do not buy."
2,Give this a miss.,"I bought this thinking that it would be a good replacement for my Shure in-ear monitors. This pair is rather rigid and inflexible. It doesn't fit comfortably around the ears. Its length is way too short. Quality of product, I'd say it meets bare minimum function. Its sound clarity is good, it block out ambient sound, but not totally.If given a choice, I would have given this a miss."
1,Disappointing,"My goal is to have earbuds for my iPhone which are more comfortable and sound better than the set that came with it. When I received these, I ""broke them in"" as advised for 24 hours and then popped them in for a listen. They sounded okay, but switching between these and the standard iPhone earbuds, the Apple earbuds had far better sound and range. I used them a bit longer, but no matter what they simply do not sound as good as the Apple earbuds which I find terribly uncomfortable."
4,Trials and Tribulations,"(On behalf of the Revolving Door Book Club) This is an ambitious debut covering the trials and tribulations of John Kalterbunner, an outcast with incredible bad luck, as his young life crashes around him and how he attempts to eek out revenge on his hometown in the most vile, smelly, messy, and often, hilarious way. The preface is awful, but the book is extremely well written and flows. Despite the large cast, he does a wonderful job of making them real and memorable. The very end and the meaning behind the story are somewhat muddled and flat, but that didn't detract much from the story. Shame we lost this author too early in his life and career."
4,A very thorough volume for the serious student,"Livingston's book is very concise and dense. It contains a lot of information, but is not the kind of book you could sit down and read through from cover to cover. It is excellent as a reference, a sort-of knot theory encyclopedia."
5,Replacing Craftsman Blades,Installed blades in Craftsman Jointer/Planer and they fit nicely. Really good price and appears to be a good product. Will see how they hold up.
2,WORTHLESS,"Says right in the description:Durable steel template frame includes tabs for accurate placement on door or jamb.Works on small doors, but the jamb, or the door frame that the door actually hangs on is a different matter. The template has a strike though, that you can clearly see in the picture above, it was intented, i guess to be a ""stop"" for the door, but when using it on the jamb,it stops the template from doing it's job and that would be to let you route out a matching cut out for the door's othe hinge flap to fit into, instead it blocks you from doing a jamb cutout, so it will only work on a door, not the casing Jamb.Since i needed it now and did not want to return it, it got out my anvil and mini sledge hammer and knocked the protruding stops flat with the rest of the hinge, and not i can screw or nail it to a jamb and make a perfect cut. Wonder why they didn't think of that.?????"
4,Convincing and fascinating,"Point-by-point, Henriette Mertz builds the case that the Chinese were travelers, sojourners in America. 4000 years ago.Then in 500 AD, a missionary (or group of missionaries led by) Hwui Shan embarked on a mission trip all along the Pacific, inspiring the legends of the Mayas and Aztecs.Note: this book lacks photographs. Acutely frustrating. I am ordering Morley's ""The Ancient Maya"" to see whether it includes comparative photographs."
2,Snatched,"PLEASE take a good, HARD listen to the sound samples if you're thinking about buying this cd. APART FROM ""Disco Science"" and ""Angel (by Massive Attack)"" great techno cd by the way, I thought this CD [stunk]. After reading the other reviews THEN listening to the sound clips afterwards...I got that expression on my face that's like...what?!?! You know, where the one eyebrow is up...Anyways, in my opinion, the reviews DO NOT match up with the CD. The End. :p"
4,Glad I got it!,"As a graphic designer who got put on two months bed rest during my first pregnancy in Septemeber, this little laptop has been great. I have a regular Apple G-5 desktop for my everyday freelance needs, but was obviously unable to use it while being confined to bed. I'm able to run all my programs I use the most (Dreamweaver, Flash, Illustrator, Photoshop, Quark) and purchased a Mighty Mouse to go with it for ease of use. Also works great with my Wacom digital tablet. It's very fast and very reliable. Probably the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because as far as I can tell, keyboard backlighting was not included with this model. This is a shame as I often need to use it in the dark or will need it during air travel later. I thought this was rather silly and cheap of Apple, and think all laptops should have this option to be honest. It's even harder to see the keyboard when you have a big, pregnant stomach in the way and cannot have it close to your face. Otherwise, no regrets!"
3,"Umm, a little disappointed","Notebook was broken down only 7 days after starting use.I had to send it back for repair.Warranty service was good,though. Fast."
1,so far...not good,"I was very excited to use my new macbook (as im a first time user), but when i finally received the package and tried to use it, it didnt open. I thought maybe im just not ding it right. I called apple support and she was not very helpful. All she said that I should just bring it to a service center. Which I did. Only to find out the mother board needs to be replaced. Imagine how disappointed i was. Unbelievable that they delivered to me a non-working laptop. I wanted to have the whole thing replaced but when i spoke to customer service, he said that as per policy, they would only replace a unit within 15 days from purchase date. I told him its within the allowable time frame then he gave me another reason / policy why they cant replace it. So im stuck with a mother board replacement. I have to wait for 7 days to have it fixed."
3,What happened to me,"I just switched to Mac. I did so on the prodding of friends and family who were long time Mac users. I was convinced. When I got my Macbook, I was excited! BUT within a week, it was screwing up. It would take long to open applications, etc. I did much of what the manual had said to do. It worked. But another week passes by and well... I couldn't boot it up anymore. After several calls to Apple Support, it was determined there was a problem with my hard drive, they replaced my hard drive, all while I was traveling in Asia. So I feel like I took a risk in buying the laptop from Amazon and got a lemon. :( So far its worked well so far (after the hard drive replacement)... Thanks Apple Support."
3,Lots of great songs on this one,I remember many of these songs from the 60s and 70s. some were turned into commercial jingles and TV show themes. this is a great collection. He was a very unusual and talented songwriter and singer
4,Full of techniques,This book is full of techniques for collage art. Great ideas through out the book. Worth having
5,Fantastic Book,This book is FULL of ideas and fantastic instructions. The secrets to making peeling paint and grungy edges...this book has it all! Everything you need to know is in this book with plenty of ideas. I highly recommend this one...I ordered several and this is my favorite.
2,"IF YOU BUY THIS STROLLER, BE WILLING TO REPLACE IT WITHIN SIX MONTHS","We bought this for our daughter at Christmas because it is classic in styling and a welcome respite from all the pink out there.Sadly, we have had similar problems with the bassinet collapsing but worse than that, the base of the stroller has failed. The areas where the axles are welded to the stoller have come undone and are beyond repair.My daughter is very gentle with her toys and never has broken any of them. It is quite clear that the problem lies in the construction, not the wear and tear from my two year old.I called the company that makes this stroller, Badger Basket, and they were of no help whatsoever. I would love to buy the stroller again because there's nothing out there that compares to it, lookswise, but I am VERY hesitant to do so. I doubt it would hold up any better."
5,Perfectly Sweet,"I have read many Indian-White romance books but this one was very different. This is not your silly cliche books but very well written. Jassie's mother and sister are crib workers, something most people now days don't know what is, so Ms. Baker obviously done her research. Jassie is young and her attraction to an older man was very common in that day and time, not sick. Creed is a hard man, he has lived a tough life but he has not allowed misfortune to turn him into a brute. I almost cried when he buys food for little Jassie. Don't want to spoil it, so if you like romantic westerns with respect to that era, this is a good one."
2,Authentic?,The color is not as bold as I have a bottle from a previous purchase at a salon. Color is discontinued so I took a chance with Amazon. I am not thrilled. I did receive very speedy service by the seller.
5,Why this movie kicks,"A modern day classic, should have been on Roger Ebert's top ten movie of the 90s but oh well what can you do. True is i'm not sure why i love this movie so, could it be because it's like motion picture poetry, that it's a gay retelling of Henry IV, or just the simple fact that thanks to this movie i now spend a few minutes each day staring at the sky and watching the clouds move? Either way this is River Phoenix at his best even though the king of the streets Bob nearly steals the show. Jesus Christ Keanu Reeves is actually watchable in this film. Nuff said!"
1,Can't believe!,"I just cannot believe that there are so many great reviews for this movie. I had a very hard time keeping my eyes open because it was so boring. River Pheonix was pretty good in acting, but you just get so sick of him suffering from cezar after awhile. I guess he has an issue with his mother, so every time he encounters some stressful moments, he goes into this cezar which happends a lot throughout the movie. Another problem I have with this movie is that, it seems like all the other male characters are given directions to kiss and do other things with eachother. Keenaue and River seems to avoid having to do this, so good for them to just collect their checks for being in this movie, when others had to do more of the work to make it more believable."
1,cane,This cane is OK. The handle chippped and looked old after about one week. The tip cannot be replaced. If you try to do this the cane falls apart and cannot be repaired. I would not recommed this cane to anyone.
2,betty blue,"Tame Tame Tame not bad just Tame---story content interesting, Acting believeable and convincing, scenery and general filming was just greatbut I just barely could stay awake, the dialog was riveting at times, the emotions could be felt sometimesthe sex/love scenes tend to be tepid and a bit put on (maybe overdone? fake looking?)even the wife dozed offif it had been free even it would barely been worth the gas to go it it---"
4,A Warning on his Edition Only,"BETTY BLUE (372 le matin) (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (IMPORT, ALL-REGION)This film has always been 5 stars in my mind but on this edition all genitalia have been pixilatedly blurred out. This is a small, somewhat humorous distraction to an overall beautiful and disturbing piece but a warning is called for here regarding integrity."
3,"Gotta weigh in, I'm on the director's cut side - at least as a choice","I'm not in the extreme on this, in that I enjoyed the original cut,but I think the longer cut is both richer and more haunting.But in any case, it seems absurd to bring out a blu-ray thatdoesn't at least have the choice of both. (Same thing withthe recent 'Brazil' blu-ray).When the director's preferred original vision has long been availableit just seems wrong for the only blu-ray to not contain that. If youwant to give me the original cut too, and let me compare, terrific!(As Criterion did on their great 'Fanny and Alexander' set)But if you have to pick only one, it's not the one the film-makerdislikes!"
4,"Trig Johnson on Prof. Keith Ward's ""Religion and Revelation""","Not as engaging as Professor Ward ""live"" (be it lecture, luncheon or tutorial); but an endeavour worthwhile, nevertheless: his is a lucid articulation, quasi-rigorous examination, fair evaluation, and creative conceptualization of five major world religious traditions' (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism) concepts of revelation. Certain to evoke controversy and to stimulate dialogue both within and across these traditions, ""Religion and Revelation"" will appeal to theologians, philosophers of religion, and anthropologists, in particular; professional scholars and non-specialists, alike. Trig Johnson of Florida"
5,wow.,"this is an absolutely awesome CD. i love the lyrics and the music, it's so well put together. i've never listened to Coldplay before except for the song ""yellow"" and they are now my favorite band. i know i sound a little extreme, but this CD is REALLY good. it's worth buying."
2,Comparison to Parachutes,This album in no way can match up to the brilliance of Parachutes. It's just boring drivel. Parachutes was ten times more upbeat and faster and had the emotion that this album lacked. Only a select few songs were good on this album such as clocks and in my place. If you want to try out coldplay buy parachutes and you will fall in love. This album was cheaply put together in 2 years unlike Parachutes which took a lifetime to create and is filled with much more emotion.
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely love this cd. If you like the songs ""In My Place"" and ""Trouble"" from Parachutes, then you should like this cd. This cd has one of the most beautiful songs recorded - ""The Scientist."" The lyrics and arrangements in this song are just amazing. I like piano and strings in music and love how Coldplay uses them in their songs. Plus, Chris Martin has a great voice. They also rock out more on this cd which is another plus. Too many bands from England are making music that puts you to sleep. This will definitely keep you awake."
5,Simply beautiful,"I adore this CD.I love this CD more than any other CD that I have.My car was stolen this last year, and with it, they took my Coldplay CD, and this added to my upset-ness at the whole situation.Alright, maybe I exaggerate a bit, but this CD truly is a gem.I started out liking two songs on the album: 'The Scientist' and 'Clocks.' A bit later, I began listening to the entire album. Since I first purchased this CD, earlier this year, I have come to appreciate each and every song on the album, from 'Polotik' to 'Amsterdam.' Each song is deep, meaningful, artistic, and beautiful.I like to call Coldplay the artistic, intelligent person's band. The lyrics mean almost as much as the music, which is also brilliant.As apposed to their last CD, 'Parachutes,' 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is appropriate to blast in your car and become hypnotized by the 'neon, electric' guitar and drums, rather than put to sleep.This CD is utterly brilliant. I love it!"
2,Pretty Dull...,"Yeah they have some nice melodies here and there and Chris Martin can sing, but it all sounds so drab and pedestrian. This is just a really depressing album, and not depressing in the way of subject matter of the songs but depressing in the way the songs are performed. Each song just slowly drones along, never raising above a whimper, and before you know it you're at track 10 wondering where all the previous track went."
5,Another great CD!,"Worth the wait. Once again Coldplay hits the spot with another great sounding album. They have great lyrics too. If you want something different, give this a listen."
3,Lacks chord progression of Grant Lee Buffalo or Radiohead !,"I listened to this one over and over trying to figure out who the guy ""really"" sounds like....its not Bono or Radiohead...its Grant Lee Buffalo. The lead vocalist is fantastic...not many will dispute that, however, the songs all rely on his voice to carry them !! The rest of the band needs to step up and learn a few new chords.....each song contains 2-3 which are beaten over their instruments repeatedly. The guitar and piano melodies become too bland because there is little change in the song....no refrain, no chorus, etc....which is ok for one or two songs but to bang on the same chords for a whole album doesn't say much for the musicianship of the rest of the band. The sales on this album are big....big enough that I would advise the lads to seek out a lead guitarist that can occassionally shine over the rhythm section. If haunting melodies is your thing....check out Grant Lee Buffalo or Radiohead....they do them much better !!"
4,Over 1000 reviews...must be good.,"The debut album Parachutes is amazing, but this was the album where Coldplay kicked in the door and said ""we are as great as our inspirations"". Might be true. Even Radiohead and U2 may agree. Three huge singles came from this album. ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and the most moving of them ""Clocks"". My personal favorite non-single I think is ""Warning Sign"". I get so lost in that one. This album was so big it probably created the inevitable backlash by some fans, but's it's near impossible not to like. Afterwards I think Coldplay became the poster boys for the Adult-alternative genre. So be it."
5,"""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" Review","If you bought this album before Coldplay's debut album ""Parachutes"", you will see a graind improvment in their music. ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"" is a grand improvement over the original. Coldplay are musical geniuses. They are the best!"
1,"Gwenyth and Huey Lewis Singing ""Cruisn'"" is Even Better than this Crappola!",A 2 year old could play the Clocks piano riff. And let's face it... we are all sick to death of it. U2 thinks they are giving the Beatles a run for their money which is a huge joke. But Coldplay thinks they are giving U2 a run for their money and that is just as funny. Chris Martin might as well give up and move to LA and write commercials for life insurance companies.
3,not bad . . .,"This is a pretty good band but I feel they've been played up way too much in the press. The lead singer has a bit of a wimpy voice, but that's not really a problem. You have to wonder if he'd sound the same if Dave Mathews never existed. The similarities between their voices and singing styles are undenyable. Radiohead, who has obviously had a big influence on this band (they've acknowledged as much) is better musically and far more innovative. The first Coldplay single, ""In My Place,"" is pretty good. However the only song on the album that really impressed me was ""Clocks."" Other songs are less impressive with repetitive song structures and other qualities that I've heard just too much already. If I hadn't, I'm sure I'd dig this a lot more."
3,It's fine--but is it something you'd purchase?,"I wanted to give it 2.5 stars. A lot of albums sound okay, but aren't really engaging enough to buy; this is one of those. ""Clocks"" experienced for the very first time late at night on a decent-fidelity GM Delco car radio is undeniably memorable. But then you play it back in your head later, and you know what?It's a Bruce Hornsby and the Range. It's Bruce Hornsby and the Range crossed with Elton John's ""Love Lies Bleeding.""With a little U2 thrown in for good measure.And that's just Clocks. The rest of the album is competent enough; it plays out okay enough. A little sad-sack for what it is. It's basically a competent, not really strong-enough-to-actually-buy album."
3,its okay...,I love coldplay's newest cd. It probably needs more recognition. But this cd was not nearly as good. I just recommend buying the newer one.
5,Favorite album - could listen to it anytime,In my opinion one of the best Coldplay albums.Lyrics and music coexist so nicely. Recommended for a special someone
5,Wow,"Awesome. Music great. Lyrics great, Sound great. One of those classics that join the ranks of Pink Floyd, Santana, Rick wakeman, for sheer good vibrations and good thoughts. There is hope for mankind yet."
1,sup,"I got this cd basically just for the song clocks. that song is one of the best new songs, in my opinion, that I've heard in a while. the song's just awesome. I mean it really is. but I'm just not getting the other ones that much. they're slow and boring to me - either slow and boring, or dull and repetitive. or all of the above. ... Clocks is awesome. I dunno, maybe get the cd for clocks? whatever. I'm not terribly impressed YET - but then I've just gotten the cd, and maybe I need to ""discover"" it. ...My liking for Clocks reminds me of that, and like Poison, it stands out from the rest of the songs. None of the other songs on this cd have such a cool melody or anything. ... A beautiful, enchanting piano melody that's almost unmatched, and which sticks in your mind, nice strings and all, nice vocals. even the drumming is good. just a good song, it all works together. okay so maybe not I've overrated it somewhat and all, but oh well...."
2,Identity crises,"Having successfully completed copying Radiohead and the Dave Mathews Band for Parachutes, Coldplay now sets its sights on Tom Petty at his worst. I really tried to like this album, thinking the band would by now find their own sonic identity. After three beginning-to-end listenings, I hope they haven't.Earns first star for In My Place, second for cover design."
2,NOT Pink Floyd....,"I don't get it. These guys are not THAT good! Other than the song ""Clocks"", I have a difficult time finding anything on this CD that is memorable. I do have to hand it to the band - they did keep this album simple and it is not the same over-processed garbage that the music industry is putting out, but this band is not ""there"" yet. But this album does not compare to anything Pink Floyd has done."
4,coldplay review,i like both of their albums and they came to dallas a few months back..their music is fun and beautiful and they dont sound like radiohead...and the whole band is talented.i will probably buy more of their music in the future and i dont think they are going to quit too soon..but if they do chris can go solo and we will all love him and suport him yay !
2,Is OK but...,"I like a couple of tunes from this album. But in reality Mrs. Machado needs to work on her reputation and learn to keep her legs crossed, specially when engaged."
4,Good devotional,This was a gift for my 87 year old dad. He was very pleased with the large print.The corner of the bottom of the book got bent when inserted in the mailing envelope.The damage was minimal.
4,Review of fellows computer tool kit,The product was delived on time. The product was as written and has been very helpful. I would definitely consider buying other fellowes products.
4,"Finally, a hero who suffers without appearing weak","Romances where the heroine cares for the hero when he falls ill simply cannot hold a candle to this. I started with this third book and was immediately captivated by all members of the Carroway family, as well as the way Lucinda's friends all come to their rescue.This is Robert's story, more so than Lucinda's, and the way he decides to get back to normal life deserves respect. Unlike some of the other reviewers I found Robert's recovery quite credible, as I choose to believe that he'd been working toward it over the years.This book didn't have as much of the charming dialog that you tend to get in Enoch's work, but Robert is quite reserved to begin with. Lucinda did pretty well on her own though.Some reviewers have complained that the trilogy is formulaic but I disagree. I've read 2 out of the 3 books now and while there's a hero and a heroine and they're in love at the end of it, that's the basic framework for any romance story."
4,Cockroaches! That sculpt! I love it!,"Although not quite STELLALUNA or VERDI, Ms. Cannon excels with CRICKWING, the story of an injured cockroach-turned-sculptor. The book, as all of Ms. Cannon's books, is vibrant and beautiful, and a welcome addition to my own daughter's library.The story: we follow the injured Crickwing through his own torments, his release in art (sculpting food) and subsequent personal growth when he turns tormentor to some leaf cutter ants. His eventual acension to savior of the ant colony (from Army ants) resolves the conflict (both internal and external) in a way sure to delight and comfort your child.CRICKWING, although not the best book (by Ms. Cannon, or otherwise), is sure to delight fans of STELLALUNA or roaches (see the movie Joe's Apartment)."
4,As solid as they come.,"This is a great score. It's another one of those dreamlike scores that goes along the same lines as Heat, Memento, and K-Pax. The ending song it the most enjoyable song on this soundtrack. If you were a fan of Heat's soundtrack, you won't be dissapointed with Traffic. Enjoy!"
4,Soundtrack that must be listened to...,"After seeing the movie, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. A great compilation of ambient tracks. This is not a soundtrack you would sing along to, or bring to a party -- but rather one you can sit back and just enjoy (take to the head, so to speak). Each track is filled with such emotion, even if you didn't see the movie you could enjoy it immensely. I bought this soundtrack to kick back, knock down some work and just let my imagination run wild. As stated before, GREAT soundtrack for a dinner party -- or just closing your eyes and being at peace. Don't delay - EXPERIENCE the TRAFFIC!"
3,Better when accompanied by the movie,"I agree that this music is enjoyable and after reading several reviews and seeing the movie, I ran out to buy a copy. I decided to listen to the soundtrack at a listening station and it wasn't as good as I remembered. I would hesitate before buying this. You really need the movie to enjoy the music. By itself, the music just doesn't really go anywhere."
1,Pointless and Boring,"I just finished reading Deep Freeze and what a disappointment. It was 366 pages of...well, nothing I guess. After reading about 50 pages of people describing the snow coming down I felt like saying, ""enough already, get on with the story!"" And that was the problem, the story never really progressed beyond that point.The only character I even remotely cheered for was the ""bad"" son. He was the only one who had even a little bit of depth to him. The other characters were flat and dull.Finally, I still don't get the whole radical faction aspect of the novel. It didn't come into play to any great extent like you're led to believe on the back cover and basically was a minor distraction while reading at best.Save your money and go purchase a novel by Rick Mofina if you want well developed characters, great story lines and suspense."
1,Waste of money,These blades are an absolute ripoff. The blades that I was replasing did a better job when they were worn out then these pieces of garbage did new. Save your time and money and avoid this blade.
3,mattress a little disappointing,I had to supplement the mattress with a foam topper for comfort -- I hadn't expected springs -- and you can't sit on either end as it might collapse on you. Otherwise it's a good portable cot for additional sleeping as needed.
2,lug nut lock,This did fit threadwise but stands out more than it looked on screen. Locks work using it for full spare. Looking to replace all with lug nuts.
3,McGard Cone Seat Wheel Locks,"It fits just fine on my Honda Civic. The item is just as described.Of course, I can't assure how effective it will prevent your tires to be stolen. However, it may work as minimal visual deterrent. For the price, I think it'll be work it."
4,"Great locks, just don't loose the key or over tighten.","I like these locks because they look great, function fine, and cost much less than the same locks re-branded by car manufactures. As the product description mentions, Mcgard makes the OEMs car dealerships add-on. My car dealer wanted the same locks with their label at about triple the price so I saved some money and purchased these instead.I have these on two Honda vehicles and have no problems so far. The only complaints I've heard of is from people loosing or stripping the keys. Mcgard does offer replacement keys so save the documentation that comes with the locks. I'm sure stripped keys is caused by over torque'ing. These things can handle torque at least up to Honda's specifications for lug nuts on my wheels. If you like to tighten things as tight as your he-man strength can put out, consider using a torque wrench to make sure you do not over tighten and ruin the key. Be advised over tightening can be worse than under tightening."
4,Good change of pace for my kids.,"Our entire family really liked this video. Our three kids are all in elementary school now and have outgrown the so called ""Big Plane, Big Construction"" type videos. If you've seen them, you know the ones I mean ... HELP ! This video shows more than just things. It showed my kids a real adult with a real job. The pilot they used was wonderful and my kids and their friends are still memorizing every word that weird Bob the host guy says. I can't watch it anymore, but my three kids are still giving this tape countless runs for the money. Good stuff !"
2,interesting book if you already have a knowlege of art,"I was required to read this book for a graduate course I am taking. Having no background knowledge in 80's artist and only hearing of a handful of these artists prior to reading this book, I felt in the dark most of the time. Not being familiar with the artists' work(s) created a missing link for me while reading this book. I may have been more interested in what these artists had to say if I was more familiar with their works. Even the few pictures the book did reproduce, were not that helpful. If you have a fairly good grasp on the works of these artists, read this book. If you don't like art or are not really familiar with the interviewed artists, this is not a book for you."
5,Between memory and history...,"This is a fascinating memoir, alternating between memory and historical records. The remembrances of the author's mother of her early life in western Ireland and her later immigration to the United States are set against his searches for the actual historical documents and records of these events.This is not a sentimental or saccharine biography, but an unflinching look at the lives of the respected-historian author's relatives and neighbors, both in Ireland and in America.I read it over several days, and would have finished it sooner had I not found myself lost in thought so many times over what records might support-- or contradict--the stories of my own mother and grandmother. I am telling all my friends about this book."
2,The Kindle edition: Greek and Hebrew sometimes not even readable,The hardcover edition is very good and usefull but the Kindle edition needs a lot of work. I understand that the Hebrew might still be a problem because the Kindle doesn't support Hebrew but the Greek can be fixed.The gap in quality between the hardcover and the kindle is not reflected in the price difference between the two for they are almost priced the same.
2,No index!,"I am a bit stunned, here. I purchased this kindle edition for USE! In order to look up a word, you first choose one of three dictionaries to peruse. The table of contents then plops you at the beginning of that dictionary and you are left to page through to the entry you are seeking! There aren't even links to the beginning of each letter's section. Nope. You begin with A and page through. The first word I sought in this book begins with R. .....still paging...."
4,good tool,thkyu very much looking forward to using this tool will be ordering more books for my schooling to help some lost soul
4,What a blast for the kids! And the parents.,"This is just a simple little plastic toy that actually launches the included cows, sheep, and ducks several feet! Since my kids have seen the movie they really get into using this. The Wooden Rabbit is made of printed styrofoam, so it will stay in the packaging and out of the hands of my youngest child. The large cup on the Catapult can also be used to launch other small toys, and this may or may not be a good thing."
3,Very old footage,"After seeing commercials and You Tube videos for this product we expected it to be a DVD full of current live action fire trucks zooming down the roads with their lights and sirens on. Instead we found an old DVD full of old footage and boring slow moving tours of a firehouse and firetrucks. Very boring, regretful purchase. My 21/2 year old does not watch it."
1,Poor,"I can't watch this video. After the 3 mins of sirens and chrome, flashing, dashing firetrucks, which is what we all wanted - right kids? It degenerates into showing firefighters with bad hair eating breakfast to the backdrop lyrics 'everybody needs a hero' (- James, Age 2)"
3,An introduction to wrestling as an organized sport,"This book covers alot of territory: wrestling hisotry, types of wrestling, basic skills, match rules, governing bodies and associations, and tips for participants, parents, coaches, and spectators.As a broadbrush introduction, the book is very good. If, however, you were looking for detail in any one of those areas, with the possible exception of match rules and etiquette, you'll need supplementary books. I would venture that the best audience for the book might be parents or interested spectators. Participants and coaches will need much more detail on skills and on successful development of a program."
1,Major flaw with the Kindle edition,"The text is quite nice and it is a very readable translation.The trouble is in the formating of the Kindle version. Specifically, the lack of a table of contents.There are 3470 locations in this book. At the very least, they could have put in a table of contents to get you to each of the six chapters. Instead, you have to guess where the passage begins.In a novel or other linear work, the lack of a table of contents is a slight annoyance. In any reference work, especially a Bible commentary, it is flat-out a deal breaker."
1,terrible book and title is deceiving,"i didnt like the book, because the title presented it in a different manner from what the author wrote about.its not a book about angels from heaven and the Judeo Christian God, but other religions as well and she talks about demons and mediums, hinduism, strange quotes from reliogious leaders... and her experiences with psychics, ghosts....its not what the title says it is...its terrible and its not inspiring at all...i would give it a zero star if i could!! the author shouldnt have used that title...its not appropriate for the book.this book is more about her personal encounters with psychics and ghosts...this is definitevely a thumbs down book."
2,Not enough detail in areas,"This book was required for School. I had never touched VB until this class, and this book was not very helpful to me and every one else in the class. When I got to chapter 5 it felt like all I had done was type in code presented in the book. There was very little explanation as to why you were doing some things. It really appears that there was not enough room for explanation because of the layout. The class ended up buying the ""Teach Yourself VB.Net in 24 hour"" from Sam Publishing. The Sams book breaks the code down in a much more understanding way."
3,Better than I thought,I just re-read this book. Much better than I initially thought. I think it is better if you have a little knowledge of VB.Net beforehand.
2,Crammed,"I purchased this book because it claims to be easy to learn VB. Although this book does make certain tasks involved in writing VB code seem easy, they certainly are not. I think the major problem with this book is the fact that they use a ""two page"" approach to teaching. This means the explanation is on the left page and some ""examples"" on the right page. This is OK, except that some, if not most, tasks in VB require more than one page to explain. Therefore, the reader is left to try to guess and search for the concept the authors are trying to convey in the one-page explanation.I was forced to put this book aside and purchase another book that has more detailed explanations on what I'm trying to learn. This book IS NOT for the beginner!"
3,In other words ...,"Not bad for beginners. But it's a far cry from being ""the best book you can find on the subject"". I suggest Mike Murach gets a bit humbler with those statements. The content is good, and if the author hadn't managed it to fill pages artificially with reformulating what she had just said, this book would have come out with less than 300 pages. Now take out the ridiculous two-page format and you could write this one on 150 pages."
4,Not groundbreaking but that's OK,"A deftly executed package of power pop. You've heard these riffs a thousand times but most of it is catchy nonethelss. Occassionally things sway a bit far to the pop/ballad end; the screaming tribesmen are best when they're rocking out w/ a good head of steam. I should mention that the recording is absolutely xlnt, more unusual than it should be these days."
4,high chair,"Once assembled, this high chair is functional. Assembling it was rather difficult but overall, this high chair serves the purpose."
2,Meh,"Not a good high chair. It works for a very basic one, I guess. The screws are always falling out from the legs. My two yr old son bounces when he eats and once he bounced the leg out and the whole thing fell over! In the summer he gets stuck to the plastic. Very hard to keep clean too. Also when we were putting it together, the plastic started to seperate, should have returned it right then!"
1,Just a step under GOD,"You sure can tell that the accused was helping to write this book. I think this is one of the worst books I have read in ages. Paul Dunn would like the world to know what a champ he is. I, for one have decided he is anything but. I feel bad for his dead wife. He has placed himself right up there with god. I sure think that he probably got away with MURDER. This was a very disappointing book. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK!!!!!!! It is very one sided and slow moving."
1,Bias,This book appears to be extremly one sided. The book is written to give you the impression that there was no way the husband would be guilty. It seems to me that there were things left out to give that impression. I also think that whether the husband did it or not he is still directly responsible regardless of how this book paints it. I also didn't know the Rio Grand River ran through the northwest corner of New Mexico.Given this fact is wrong I wonder how many others are.
1,Can I say this was Feather's worst?....,"I usually enjoy Jane Feather's novels. But this one really disappointed. It was very long, but only because I found it tedious to get through. Magdalen just seemed like the worst spoiled brat. I just kept getting very upset with the way the character acted and the choices that Magdalen made. The plot was a little outrageous, too. What 11 year old even thinks of true and lasting love? The leading male characters aren't even memorable. The entire novel seemed to focus on Magdalen's wants and how she was bound and determined to get it at any cost. It was simply ridiculous. My reaction once FINALLY finishing the thing, was to throw it out."
2,Not so good,"This book is a little long and was boring. I think that Jane Feather writes well and she could have done better with the story. I hated the relationship between Magdalen and Guy, it grosed me out that she would cheat on her husband even though she knew he was alive. I felt so bad for Edmund and how his life turned out. I did not like the ending because it was predictable and it was unfair. I think that this book was okay and that people should read it only if they are bored out of their minds with nothing to do."
2,An excruciatingly read,"This book is packed with historical content. As far as the storyline and character development goes, a quote from Thumper's mom (in Bambi) comes to mind: ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""Enough said.Kerry Atkins"
2,very disappointed,"I usually find Jane Feather books enjoyable, but this one left me very disappointed! I felt that Mag did all the chasing! It didnt seem like a real love story! I mean the hero didnt even break a sweat! He gave her up as easily as he would give up his dog! I like to see a little fight or...... I think u guys get the point! All together a let down! The only reason i finished it was because i hate to leave a book unread!"
1,Never received product,Sorry that I can't review the product but i never received it! The seller/merchant cancelled my order without even telling me and kept me waiting a whole month for a product it never intended to send! A very lousy way to do business!
1,Save you money.,"This book paints **every** neighborhood in and around NY as being lovely and quaint, even if in reality they are filthy, graffiti-drenched, and not particularly safe. This book complicated my move to NY because, based on it's misinformative ""rosey"" neighborhood profiles, I went and looked at apartments in a lot of neighborhoods that were filthy and scary. I finally found a great neighborhood to live in, but this book had been no help at all. The sad truth is that not every place in NY is a great neighborhood to live. It's a big city and you have to be careful and avoid the bad places. This book **sinfully** ignores this. It's like they're bending over backwards trying to please every neighborhood council in the city instead of being accurate. I've never felt so ripped off about a book purchase before."
1,reader beware,"2007 is listed as the pub date for this kindle edition, but it's actually an electronic version of a 1998 book. When you read the sample, you discover that prices, etc. are as of 1998, making the book pretty much useless as a guide to moving to New York. Things change so quickly that this would make many of the neighborhood descriptions no longer very useful as well. In general, beware of Kindle publication dates, since they're the date that the book was added to Kindle and may be very different from when the book really came out."
3,This is utilitarian - it is a good stowaway.,I purchased the same jacket some years ago. This product has been cheapened and is less comfortable. It is however still a good deal for the occasional need.
2,Not so great!,"This boot is FAR inferior to thew other boots that 5.11 produces. I have owned several paires of 5.11 boots and have never had to think abouth what size I am ordering. I get the boots and put them on and they fit, NOT the case with these boots! I got them out of the box the other day, put them on and imediatly had to take them off! Not only were they nowhere near the 12 that I have worn for the past 3 years, but the construction of these boots was nothing like the other 5.11 boots. Nedles to say Amazon can keep this boot and I will be getting a pair of the ATAC Storm, or ATAC shield!"
2,Lugubrious....,"A very unsatisfying book with a very interesting setting. The portrait of the immediate aftermath of WW2 in Berlin is excellent but the story is drawn out much longer than necessary. The writing is OK but the characters are unappealing, especially the main character, whose joylessness is monotonic in the extreme. You don't expect a story set in war-devastated Berlin to be a boffo laff riot but you can expect some spirit, some elan and energy."
2,the lousy novel,"Kanon's description of post-war Germany was fascinating & he might make a good history writer, but his prose is hackneyed. This plot rambles & fails to engage. It is difficult to follow & doesn't motivate one to make the effort to do so. The ""love"" scenes read like technical writing & the protagonist, Jake, is constantly directing his lover's gaze towards his manly, reassuring words with his finger under her chin. If that happened to me that many times, I'd bite the directing digit right off!I ended up skimming the last quarter of the book just to get it over with."
4,"requires some patience, but worth it!",This book was hard to get into - lots of war-time political banter in the beginning. But after the first few chapters the plot takes form and the story takes off and hooks you...
1,Not worth it,"I found this book impossible to read. Rather than tell a story, Kanon fills page after page with dialog -- not particularly great dialog -- and leaves it to you to wade through and find meaning. I found myself desparately scanning ahead, looking for a paragraph that would advance the plot or illuminate the characters. Alas, there weren't many."
2,A wee bit mild,"I am a FULL-ON tea drinker. I drink green tea and black tea all day long and when it comes to my breakfast tea, it HAS to be a one-two punch or I'll revert back to my bad coffee habit. I quit about a year ago but I do still ache for that incomparable aroma that only coffee can give!! I am having a pretty good go of my Twinings Breakfast Tea and TAZO's Awake still does it for me but I'm always on the look-out for a stronger breakfast tea and TAYLOR's is NOT IT! I wan't the equivalent of starbucks for my black tea so sometimes I double-up on the tea bags. I could have dumped the entire box of Taylor's in my cup and it still would have been too meek and mild for me. So, if you enjoy a cup of flavored water with a tinge of black food coloring, this is just the tea for you :)"

1,I like cruise but these movies suck.,"Mission impossible is about a TEAM of professionals who go after the enemies of america. This movie and the rest are abominations that even Tom cruise can't save. The plot is thin which I could forgive if this wasn't a HIGH budget movie. And of course there is no team in this movie. Instead it's a lone action hero, if this was called ""man impossible"" then I might give it a break. It's excrement though as a movie; that is based on a good premise that is not here barely. Even worse the whole idea of fighting bad guys has to always include the american government. ???It's not related to mission impossible. AND HORRIBLY there are going to create another one of these monstrosities. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!! let me guess, evil americans are out to get tom cruise. who can't be killed of course. which is fine if this didn't have the misssion impossible NAME ON IT. I do like cruise. he's good but these movies are a disgrace."
4,Still doing great,"Most times when you see a third in the series of a great movie, they get worse and worse, but with Tom Cruise in this role, I just can't see how that can happen. It was a great action film."
1,how dissapointing....,"Dissapointed, not that I had real high hopes for this one. I'm a little embarassed to say I watched this movie all the way through. The cgi was impressive, but talk about a cruise- fest. The best part was the bomb in keri russel's head exploding. The bridge scene was very cool, but the acting sucked and tom cruise is either running, crying, shooting, or base jumping about 98 percent of the time. Buy this one used if you must see it, but a scanner darkly is actually worth your money."
5,The best Mission so far!,I think is the best of the 3 Mission Impossible movies. It has the closest feel to the orignal tv show with the use of a TEAM to get the job done. The downfall of MI 2 was there was no team and was the Tom Cruise show. 2 is the weekest of the 3. Looking forward to seeing this again on DVD with my rockin home theater.
2,Typical American Cinema,"Ten minutes into watching this and I already feel my IQ dropping! I cannot imagine that trash like this gets written and money wasted producing and distributing. If you ever wondered why Americans are so 'dumbed down', you need look no further than TV and the cinema."
4,Pretty good!,"I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but I thought it was pretty good - lots of flash and action, just like the others, and the ""love story"" was more realistic as well."
1,Never got the product,"I've never received the product. I contact the seller several times and didn't get any response. I fill out a refund issue and till this day I haven't got anything. I bought the product on Dec. 7, 2006. So you figure."
3,5 stars????,"Has No.3 changed its plotline formula... NO- Something goes wrong- Ethan is on the run- Something has to be retrieved- Bad guy gets his head knocked off- everything is fixedHas No.3 introduced new gadgets and giszmos... NO- face masks- an abundance of ropeDid I walk away from the theatre with any sort of afterthought... NODoes it matter if people dont advise you of a ""spoiler alert"" in their review... NOThis has become a stock standard action movie. A few things blow up, a few paychecks generated and still some people will have you believe Mission Impossible III is worth 5 stars.Come on!"
5,Exciting!!,"This movie kept us all at the edge of our seats the entire time. It wasn't hard to follow as so many of these action movies can be, but it wasn't totally obvious either. My 9 yr old son didn't make a peep until it was over and when the credits rolled, he took a deep breath and said ""wow, that was good!"""
2,"Sorry, silly and over the top.","Contains all the material a good comedian needs to blast Hollywood and Hollywood Action movies. Reallydumb. Cruise is just getting worse and worse. At least there's Ving Rhames and Larry Fishburne. AndSimon Pegg gets in there too. Now ,HE'S a comedian......"
3,Not My Favorite In Series,"My brother was in the other room, and from the soundtrack he decided... ""Isn't this supposed to be an action movie? Sounds like you guys are watching a drama.""That is the impression those of us that watched the entire movie got. It was too dramatic, and there wasn't enough action. The romance element wasn't strong enough to get us emotionally involved. It was the action that we wanted to see more of.They completely skipped opportunities for providing those action sequences that the MI series was famous for. For instance, the critical scene where Ethan is getting the Rabbit's Foot wasn't in the movie. His cohorts are all wondering what was going on too. You can't do that to us MI fans! How did he get the Rabbit's Foot? What difficulties did he go through inside the building?I was disappointed because impossible missions are the kinds of scenes that Mission Impossible fans want to see."
5,Tom Cruise still has it.,"I have been a Tom Cruise fan for years, and I don't like all of his movies. All the recent publicity around Katie Holmes and Scientology probably hurt his image a bit - I know I was looking at him differently. But, I went to see MI:3 this weekend, and all I can say is, Tom Cruise still has it. The movie is action-packed, Tom does some great stunt work, there is a terrific supporting cast, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is terrific as the bad guy. He just oozed evil, but not in a corny, stupid way. In a very cold, merciless way. Anyway, back to Tom, he was great in the movie. He has not lost his charisma and sheer movie star presence. Yes, the plot is weak and parts of the movie are unrealistic. But we already know and expect that. We don't see MI:3 expecting it to be deep and thought-provoking. We see MI:3 expecting it to be entertaining, and that it is!"
3,Lenmar Toshiba Portege,Standard battery unit for the Toshiba Portege unit. Not very impressed by the battery performance.
1,Test IMMEDIATELY Upon Receipt!,"I purchased this item for a ""when needed"" backup. When the time arrived, it was out of their warranted period and it would not operate. I was totally out the money. An exchange would have been totally acceptable, but that was not even offered.They would not answer my emails, and I had to email Amazon for assistance. Needless to say, I was out the money and purchased the Canon model, which obviously worked fine.Buyer - beware of this model!"
1,Worked for a week,"This grip is not well manufactured. I used it for a week or so and it was great, if a little square. Then it started turning off whenever I held the camera in the vertical position. It seems like there's electrical contact issues, either between the grip and camera, or the batteries and the grip. I wouldn't recommend it for the small savings. I went to shoot and event and had to hustle to get old battery door back on so I didn't miss anything."
5,Best Soccer Shoe Ever,This classic soccer shoe is simply the best. This is the second pairs I own. And I cannot find any thing to complain about it. It is so comfortable and best of all as a player this shoe simply will not be the reason if I cannot deliver in the game. But make sure to buy just the right size. I wear size 10 tennis shoe but I bought size 9.5 for this shoe. Because it have to be just fit - not half a size larger or smaller.
2,disappointed,"2 of the 3 packages I purchased had defects to the 3-holes (only one was intact). The pockets do well to hold the cards that came with it, but buy a package of reinforcements just in case."
5,Compelling and rewarding find!,"I was at first looking for something new and different to read, rather than another atypical, anicdotal coming of age story that seems to overrun the book shelves of today, and wow what a find. Not only was it a fresh new story it was one with a timely and pioneer feel of an era long since past. You could almost feel what it would have been like had you lived in those days. A great find and a good read. I couldn't put it down... Waiting for news of a continuation to this book...I will be first in line for it!"
4,Refreshing and different,"What might life be like for a gay man in 1797? Michael Jensen looks at the possibilities in his debut novel, Frontiers. I thought the book was well researched, smoothly written and its characters were well-drawn and multi-dimensional. The narrative is entertaining but at the same time skillfully raises some gay-sensitive issues for the reader to think about. Jensen writes with a fine sense of emotion, poignant but not overwrought; I found the protagonist's struggle to make a life for himself away from the confining pressures of society very moving. One thing which bothered me a bit was that some of the scenes toward the end of the book seemed improbable. Overall, though, I found Frontiers to be an evocative and original novel and a promising debut for Jensen. I eagerly await his future efforts."
3,A fun read,"Well, this book was not one I would have picked on my own, but I was surprised and found it to be quite fun and offered an interesting twist. It is nice to see the traditional gay theme being interwoven into a different setting - the 'old west'. Although I found the ending to be somewhat overdramatized - I kept thinking that this guy watched too many Wild Wild West and Lone Ranger episodes - and finding it interesting that two ""gay"" men would find themselves together in the middle of nowhere, the story kept me intrigued.I hope that this is a beginning of more stories containing infusions of gay themes within historical contexts."
1,Rooting for the train,"This movie is one of the two 'must avoid' Annas. I think Sophie Marceau is wonderful, but not in this movie. Either she just did not 'get' Anna, or the director didn't; either way, the movie reduces to nothing more than a beautiful woman walking thru various scenes. [As was the version with Jaqueline Bisset].The two great Annas are first, Garbo's (a straight take on the novel, less a romance and more a movie of social mores and the injustice of the divorce laws that was Tolstoy's focus). The second was with Vivian Leigh, done as a deeply romantic tragedy, and much the twin of her equally brilliant, equally tragic, and often overlooked 'Waterloo Bridge'.I own and cherish these three films; buy them ! I've rented and been appalled at the other two."
2,Pretty bad,"This adaptation of Tolstoy's classic novel gets off to a bad start with a laughably ludicrous dream sequence and never recovers. I haven't read ""Anna,"" but I have read ""War and Peace,"" so I know that the strength of Tolstoy's writing is in his tremendous intellect and great insight into human character and motivation, not the events of his stories, which taken by themselves are the stuff of melodrama. That's what we get here: a bloodless soap opera full of incident and character that I could not bring myself to care about."
1,Lousy movie not worth your time of the day,"The director completely wasted his(her?) opportunity of shooting this thing in the grandness of the Russian cities. For all his efforts, the whole thing looks more like an episode from a TV series than a major movie. Marceau is still lousy at acting after all these years since she started her career in La Boum. Crap. END"
4,A FORBIDDEN PASSION.,"A forbidden passion that couldn't be helped. Anna was a torn women, carried away by her emotions between two men that she loved. The bottom line, her husband was quite older than she, and he wasn't passionately fulfilling her. A young vibrant and incredibly handsome man; fulfilled her void. Her husband found out about her adultery and pregnancy by the young man, and he confronted her about it. She admitted it, and begged him for a divorce and to keep their son. Her husband was willing to give her the divorce but not their son. She became a basket case, and well, to find out what happened next, you'll just have to buy the movie. (AWE!)"
1,DEBATED,"Adaptations of this classic piece of literature have been attempted, and although Sophie Marceau is a serious actress, she cannot come close to playing the tragic heroine, Anna Karenina. The rest of the cast cannot pull off the story or the time frame either, except perhaps for Alfred Molina. There is little to be said for this overly long attempt to tell the fatal story of Anna Karenina, and I would not want to waste your time. Read the book. It will take a lot longer, but you will get so much more from it."
5,Well worth reading,"This book is told from the perspective of Paul as an adult, looking back on his youth growing up in Marias Coulee and attending a one-room schoolhouse. The plot ambles along, rather than charges, but the characters come to life and the story is well written. If you're a person who appreciates a well-worded and clever phrase, you will love this book because it's chock full of them. This book felt like an antidote to the crazy, overbooked, super-speed pace of my life."
4,Good Review,"I got this as a gift for my grandmother who called me when she was finished to rant about how great this was! I guess it was a great book, the description sounded really nice!"
4,great story,loved the ending! Only gave it 4 starts because it's not my usual type of book. But well worth the time to read. Enjoy
1,"Cutesy, narcissistic prose","A mere 20 pages into this book, I can't stand his style of writing, like watching himself in the mirror as he writes and thinking, ""ain't I somethin'?"" This is a book club assignment and it is going to be work.Okay, Doig settled down after a while and made it readable. I see he's quite a popular writer so I'll wind up just sounding like a curmudgeon. I'm just getting the hang of this reading club thing and find a lot of ""mental popcorn"" out there. Fair enough. I couldn't do it. But there is this nagging notion that a lot of literature has hung around over time because we're afraid to call it bad (the Bible?). I mean what's up with Leviticus?Back to the book: Goes along nicely, anecdotally, then Doig decides it's time to wrap the thing up and puts a frilly end on it. This is my last review. Criticizing someone else's creative endeavors is just impotent and mean-spirited. Still leaving it as a ""one star"" though. Bunch of ""five star"" sycophants!"
1,Don't waste your time...,"I belong to two bookclubs, am in my mid-forties,and probably read thirty-five to fifty books a year. During the last fifteen years I've suffered through more than a few boring bookclub picks, and also some slouchers I've handpicked myself. Hands down, this book takes the prize for WORST bookclub pick ever. The characters were all dull and boring, with the possible exception of Morrie. And the book has NO plot. Really! I felt like ""the twist"" at the end was an afterthought when the author realized he'd forgotten to include a story line. I can't for the life of me figure out where all the raves for this book are coming from. Dull from start to finish!"
1,Slow read,Slow read. Took a long time to make the past and future connect. The ending was the best part of the book.
2,not worth it!,"I actually got this book as a gift and I am sorry that my mother paid for it! The book showcases some real weddings, but the pictures are nothing special. I have seen variations of all of the pictures online through bridal planning sites (there are a few that even showcase real weddings). There are very few actual details on how to plan an outdoor ceremony. I was very disappointed in the book. Flip through a copy at a local library or book store instead of buying."
5,must have to pass boards,My friend and I studied our butts off for boards using this book and passed with flying colors. I couldn't have done it with out this book!
4,Satisfactory and Does the Job,"Whilst i will not preach the usefulness of such reflectors, namely VERY USEFUL, HANDY and GENERATE FABULOUS results, i have just ranked the Norman i bought:- it will do the job well - no issue.- However the one i received looks different from the picture, as it does not carry the Norman logo shown (i hope i received a Norman ! ! !).- the carrying case and the zippers do not look heavy duty, which is a bit dissapointing for me as i choose to pay the upper middle range for the same reflector (vs. adorama).i recommend it if you need to test the ground on what such refletors can do and do not necessarly care if it lasts a lifetime! go for it.i will update as i go.Emile-."
1,no book,I did not receive this item eventhough I was billed for it. It did not appear in my I-pad. I am not sure waht happened to it.I would still like to receive it and am awaiting its appearance.
5,Man! Great!,These are fantastic videos. And you can watch it over and over until you get the song right. Nice!
5,Great presentation of models within politics.,Timeless classic with rich examples. As applicable today as it was when it was written back in the days of Tamany Hall.
4,Great Gift Idea!,I got this hat as a gift for Christmas & it was great! Very well made and the gift receiver loved it!
2,"Liked the content, kindle formatting messed up",They font on this book looked HORRIBLE on my kindle. Way too skinny. They need to reupload it with different formatting/font. The content was good but I could only read 1/4 of the book b/c of the font.
3,A How to Guide,"This book is great for those who haven't been involved with a wedding before, details are lacking and the book is lighthearted. A cute book to send with be my attendant invites!"
4,Neat gift,Got this book for my sister. She seemed to really enjoy reading and planning using this book.
4,Not one of the Disney greats,This film is an okay film. It's great to watch on a rainy day when you have nothing to do but not great to rent for a Friday night. Robin Williams is awesome and I'm glad to see him back. This movie tops the Return of Jafar but comes nowhere even close to as good as the original Aladdin.
2,USB 1.0 only,"When i bought this i could not find out from the specifications or any other place whether it is USB 1.0 or 1.1 , after getting it and using it i found it is only USB 1.0 which sucks as all my devices get a slower speed, apart from that it has a great compact design as i use it with a laptop. for its price it is a good deal"
4,Meyers' Handbook on Petroleum Refining Processes is a great value,"Meyers' Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes contains straightforward descriptions and discussions of key refining elements, along with helpful diagrams. I am an environmental chemist and have had recent occasion to investigate an old petroleum refinery that is on the National Priory List of Superfund. As a chemist whose focus has been on inorganics since graduate school, the organic chemistry was easily digested and assimilated. This reference is the bookshelf in my business office and not gathering dust at home. I consider it one of the best purchases that I have made in years, and at present I am using it almost daily."
3,An interesting attempt...with a good Epilogue,"Eicher presents his view of the downfall of the Confederacy, based on internal political dissent and the failure of Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Congress to resolve their many differences. He raises good points, although William Davis addresses many of these issues, in Look Away, in a somewhat more cohesive book. Eicher is strong on character sketches of key Confederate politicians, some of whom are not well known. The book drags at times, with long, somewhat tedious, quotations filling up more page space than is needed. However, the final chapter, his Epilogue, does an excellent job of explaining why the South lost the military aspects of the war but won the subsequent intellectual history of the conflict."
2,Elk Hunter Seriew Vol. 1,I was hoping that is was not a paid advertisement for Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation but that pretty much what 1/2 the video is. Nothing against Jay he did a very basic and good over view for the very beginner elk hunter. Not worth the price that is for sure. It should be given out for free. Sorry just the way it is.
3,Very good!,this was a good movie srtictly for the family and the kids.....the trinitys maybe more action filled but this was funny....the effects could have been better but oh well it was made in 1981 !
2,2 stars for the dvd !,"Like many of you, I've been watching this movie for as long as I can remember. When I saw that it was coming out on dvd, it made my day ! I had to get it ! But sadly, the dvd version is baaad ! First, the cover of the dvd looks like it was made by an amateur in graphic (there are some spelling errors) Then, when you watch the movie, there are some glitches at the bottom of your screen, the image is flat and the sound is very low. It looks like ""WHAM ! USA"" (the company that put it on dvd) took a bad vhs version of the film and transfered it to a dvd ! The only thing they add are some actors bio and scenes selection.So beware ! Even if you like this movie, you should think before spending money on such a crappy dvd ! Maybe the vhs version would be better and less expensive !"
3,Not as good as Trinity.,"This corny spoof on superheros is funny,but lacking the great comedy western genre that Terence Hill helped make so popular.The story plot is very old and heard a hundred times.I did like how even though it is not a western,Terence wears a cowboy hat through out the movie.My advice,rent it."
2,there is one good reason to see this movie,"Namely, if you want to see what Miami Beach & South Beach looked like before the revitalization of the late 1980's. Can't think of any other purpose though (unless you, like me, remember it as a guilty pleasure from HBO in the early 80's, back when we didn't have clickers and changed cable channels using a foot long box with about 15 buttons & a dial)"
2,Looks great at first but doesn't last,"I received this case less than a week ago. Because my phone is new, I've been using it a lot, setting up all of the different features. Today, the case seemed to be getting sticky, and I discovered that the coating was disintegrating/melting and was scraping off, leaving it in a matt, tacky state. The paint has also already begun to chip off and I haven't treated it badly at all.I also have the Jet Black FlexSkin Case which I also wouldn't recommend - the sliding element was coming unglued from the case when it arrived and unless you know the phone button arrangement really well, you can't be sure you're pressing the right buttons as you can't see through the black skin. Perhaps the Frosted Clear version would be better for that at least.I love the phone but I can't seem to find a case that will protect it and keep it easily useable. I've yet to try the Fosmon Crystal Clear hard case - perhaps that'll be next!"
2,Total Misfire,"Wow, did this fail. I give it two stars for Macy, a fine actor. But this movie did not ring true anywhere. Too obviously trying to be hip, the dialogue is totally unbelievable, as are the motivations. Supposedly a hit at Sundance, test audiences hated it. Believe the audiences. It is not enough to be clever; one must have characters that at least seem like they have a chance to be real. Also, the shifting tones (drama? comedy?) did not jibe. Chalk this one up as another of those inexplicable misfires (Ishtar?) that seem to fool everybody but the people buying the tickets."
3,disappointing,"This book was recommended by a friend in Australia, where it was a best seller. Watson's points--that management and political jargon are the enemies of both clear writing and the more poetic kind, while serving to obscure facts--are well taken. But they could easily have been made in 30 pages, rather than 150. A few examples of how to fix some of the sentences are useful, but the real-life examples of jargon like ""Key Performance Indicators"" (KPI) quickly grow tedious.To get the same lessons in one-tenth the time, skip this book and re-read Orwell's essay ""Politics and the English language""."
4,Fighting Spinspeak,Don Watson's book makes a significant contribution to fighting one of the great intellectual plagues of our time: the corruption of language by spinspeak and the resultant undermining of rational thought. A major antidote to the mnemonic poison manufactured daily by the spindocs throughout our society is sunlight. Watson helps spread that with dozens of outrageous examples.
5,Awesome!!,I bought this for going on a cruise and it worked great. It saved me probably about $200 in drinks. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to save a little money on a cruise.
5,Classic styling and comfort,"I have for years used the latest saddles with light weight rails and special cut outs and padding. Every two years or so the padding breaks down and the comfort goes away. I have always thought people with these old fashioned saddles were crazy. This year i purchased a classic steel frame and decided i would give the Brooks experience a try. I choose the special edition because i liked the look of the hammered copper rivets. When i frst put the saddle on my bike i had the seat fairly level and i kept sliding forward. I talked to a few ""Brooks guys"" and they all said tilt the nose up a bit. This seemed odd but I tried it anyway. After the first month of breaking the saddle in i can say the ride feels better than any of the other products i have ever used."
5,"A good read, a page turner, an easy, enjoyable book","I was compelled to write in praise of Winchester's Korea after seeing the other poor reviews. I am enjoying this book thoroughly and am not offended by Winchester's wit or maleness. There is plenty of other perspective and imagery throughout his walk that you may dwell upon if you're looking for a romantic time. It was written in the 80s though, so you'll want to get up to date - after you go and read the Journal of Hamel and his shipwrecked accounts from the mid 17th century!Winchester's language is smart. His writing structure is a breath of fresh air as someone so smart chooses to write so freely. As a fan of Krakatoa I must highly recommend this book as well."
2,Unsatisfied,"The blueberry bowls I ordered arrived in a periwinkle color... yikes! Returning these as they will not match in my kitchen! Also the packaging was sooooooo dated, which is not a concern as long as goods arrive in one piece I suppose!"
2,Ask Fido What He Thinks,"My dogs hate this product and will go to their deaths before they'll use it. They fought me tooth and nail to get it off.I wss walking my dog with it on because he's high-strung and gets to aroused at what he sees. I though the calming cap would gentle him down a bit. It didn't help much. Instead of barking at everything, he used his time to try to get the darn thing off!People walking by, grabbed their small dogs and ran when they saw a sixty-pound pit bill wearing this thing.In my personal opinion, it was not a winner."
1,Was not pleased,"I had purchased this as the price was right and my, at the time, 1 year old nephew liked hot rods. I did not open the package and had it wrapped as soon as I receive to take to a birthday party. Once the gift was opened at the party, we easily put together and the product did not work what-so-ever! Would not recommend purchasing this. If you want a toy that can actually be used and not just sit on, browse on to something else."
2,Keep looking,"Real short here. I had associated the name 'Celestron' with telescopes and therefore astronomy in general and assumed that the company made high quality products.If these binoculars were the cheapest available I would recommend them for those looking to spend the least amount of money, however they aren't, for example The Bushnell Power-viewBushnell Powerview 12x25is a few dollars cheaper and in my experience better. In my use of the products it seemed that the Bushnell had better focus than the Celestron and were also more compact. It doesn't get much simpler than that, one has more clarity at a distance and is more practical to carry, one isn't."
1,Save trees: Get something else,"This is a 114 page book that could've easily been written in a third of the space. It took only 20 minutes to read. It is badly edited, with several typos and bad internal references. A good deal of the information in it is out of date, and there is very little technical information at all. It seems to be a small expansion of a magazine article written for purchasing people. It is addressed to senior management, but I don't know of any senior management who would listen to the hype. It would be a good book to give a senior management person whom you don't like, but wants to know something about EDI."
4,Beautiful!,This movie proves again that love is more than a chemical reaction. It does not spell very much out for you. Sometimes it even seems to be just a string of single events. Yet the one thing that becomes clear in the end is that love exists in many different forms.My only problem was the desciption written on the back of my video tape (not the one pictured above). The person who wrote that can not have understood the movie very well. They made Lytton Strachey look like a cruel man and Carrington like a ... It actually put me off watching it the first time I read it.
1,Don't trust them!,"I work with wood and metal and usually use leather gloves, but this time I was wearing Makita MFORCE2 gloves. I had just cut a piece of angle iron with my bandsaw and was smoothing the edge on my bench grinder. The metal got hot and melted the glove, which burned the s**t out of my finger. Worse, I couldn't get the glove off very fast because of the velcro strap. For a glove that costs almost ten times as much as leather, I think they are pretty worthless.p.s. don't try welding with them."
5,Timeless and excellent! But I have a slight bias,"This book was written quite some time ago, so there are a few places where the social standards of the time show through. If you watch ""Mad Men"" you will understand, although it's not quite /that/ bad. Other than that, the methods and study outlined in the book are as valid today as they were then. Like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" this book is a timeless classic. Having said that, I'm ever so slightly biased... As Dr. Roy Newton is my grand father!"
2,Would be good...if they'd just shut up and play,"This cd would be more tollerable if they would shut up and just play the music. The music itself is pleasant to listen to. The beats are nice, the interludes of piano music are a dramatic touch --but then there's the ""SINGING"".What most reviewers fail to mention is this: entire blocks of song are composed mostly of someone screaming into the mic. Badly. (No, this man doesnt not have a pair of Maynard James Keenan lungs.) Its a rare moment when our vocalist's pure tones can be heard (usually at that part of the song where the music dies down) and when they are, the moment is all-to-brief and soon to be followed either by more screaming or a girlish shriek.If this type of music (with the vomit-screaming) is not your style, this cd is NOT for you. If you're into that kind of thing, go for it."
5,Wonderful book - would recommend,"This is an easy book to follow. As a beginner it was wonderful to have pictures and easy to follow instruction, I am now able to set eyes, restring comp bodies and fix wigs.. if you are a beginner it is a MUST HAVE - money well spent !"
4,Book: Awesome! Magnifying Glass: Not so much.,"I was able to find a copy of this in excellent condition, with the original magnifying glass. If you are even bothering to read this than you know already this dictionary is historic and should be. Getting it in the ""Compact"" version [laugh], is a good way to save money. However, if you plan on trying to read the introduction, or any amount of text in this book for a while I suggest getting a magnifier that you can rest on the page itself. While trying to read the historic introduction with the included magnifying glass, I got a headache. This was caused by constantly have to focus and refocus my eyes every time I moved the magnifier. If you get one that you can sit on the page and just move back and forth 1/4"" it will save your eyes a great deal of work."
4,Back to the jumpin future...,"I placed my order for both volumes of this great set. As a personal preference, I favor the second one, for it has more of an up-tempo feel to it. It wasn't until I heard the second disc that I could clearly determine what my fave song from Mr. Jordan was-""Run Joe"". He could turn your blue day upside down with his feel-good, often-times humorous style of music. I would also recommend buying The Anthology, for it has a lot of nice gems that vol 1 and 2 don't have-you can't go wrong with including him in your collection."
3,The Baby Loves It -- Mom Doesn't,"My one-year-old was irresistibly drawn to this one in the bookstore -- she loves stuffed animals and she wanted that lamb! And I must admit, she likes the book quite a bit, and still enjoys cuddling the plush animal although it's not her favorite.Parents beware, however. This one is painful for the grown-up who must do repeated readings. The rhyming text is clumsy and trite and the illustrations are icky-sweet and poorly executed. You will rapidly get sick of the thudding verse and that blasted, simpering lamb. Spare yourself!"
2,Grand Hotel the Grandest Procol,"Being an old classic rock fan, it took me years to finally decide to purchase Grand Hotel. Well my memory of the LP back from the day was obscured due to too much weed and expectation.Boy was I happy with the recording and the quality music in this CD. It was fantastic, needless to say anymore. Bringing home the bacon , Fall from Grace are Classic songs that should gain more playing time on Sirius Radio. How come?I would love to be Procol personal publicist and spread the word to all the naysayers out there stuck on Zepellin. Try it , you'll like it."
2,needs work,Good people and customer service but about half of these don't work very long and a few didn't ever work. Good return policy but product motor is not good. Too bad cause they are really beautiful when they work correctly
4,Direct sun light needed.,Works as you would think. Very bright direct sun light needed to make it move and reflect light.
1,Dead on arrival,Others had written reviews indicating this product did not work or quit working. Add me to that group. Arrived promptly. Did not work. Returned promptly. Product no good. Amazon return system very good.
2,Solar cell degrades after only a few years,"We have had one of these for the past three years. It provided endless entertainment for my daughter when the sun was coming in the windows. Suction cups made it easy to move it around as the sun moved throughout the day. I would give this 5 stars...but they are not working anymore. I emailed Kikkerland about it, and they said the solar cells degrade after two years. For the price, I honestly expected it to last much longer."
5,better than anti-depressants,"When I got this for christmas 6 years ago, I thought it was cheesy. Now, I buy them for everyone! Nothing cheers me up like a house full of rainbows! The cats love it, I feel great, and it never fails to put a smile on my face. After 6 years, my first one stopped turning. Not sure if it fell and broke or just ran out of steam, but those were a fine 6 years. I have a new one and am happy as ever."
5,rainbows,It will touch your home with the delicate colors of the rainbow.I'm a teacher and I use it in my classroom. The students love it!
1,The designer of this ride-on should be fired.,This product deserves 0 star. I bought it for less than $15 and I don't think it is even worth of that. The assembly instruction is full of errors and impossibilities. The capnuts loosened after a single gentle ride. The designer should be fired. I rarely write reviews but this product made me do so.Called the company and left a message. But no one called back.
2,Too Tame and Predatory!,"As a Jayne Ann Krentz fan, I was slightly disappointed in this book. It made me feel as if she was tentatively dipping her toes into the genre of romantic fiction, but was hesitant to go all the way. The heroine, Selena Caldwell, needed a bit of backbone - could one really have an immediate affair with the guy who just told you your fiance is married? I found the characters insufficiently involving to allow me to accept that, and, frankly, I didn't like York Sutherland. Driven guys are OK, but he seemed slightly obsessive, overly arrogant, and Selena should have given him a boot up his ego several times before surrendering to his charms. Other Stephanie James books are better - try those first."
5,Dirty Mary Crazy Larry,I bought this DVD as a gift for the holidays. The person receiving it is going to love it.He specifically asked for it. I love AMAZON.
4,Period pieces,"Classic car chases, big ol' Dodge cop cars, Susan George, and Peter Fonda as anti-hero tear up the South. Plus you get the B movie to boot."
2,SMALL SHALLOW BOWLS,Should of paid more attention to the diminsions for I got these with the intention of using them for individual pasta bowls. Their too small for that purpose and too shallow to be used for soup. They would be fine for salad or icecream bowls.
4,Historical and suspense prevail,"My daughter and I recently visited Washington DC and toured the museum and listened to the Park Ranger tell of the night that Lincoln was shot. This book fully portrays the historical content and shares the setting within the theatre to great length. The story and plot were great, but the book dragged somewhat in the middle when ""as-been"" actor spent time in London. I think Truman was trying to throw a bone to get readers off of the focus of the story. But overall, it was a good read and I plan to order the book as a gift to my daughter for the historical content alone."
3,Oddly Printed,"I expected this to be a printing of the book, instead, it looks like scaled down photocopies of the original pages which occupy the middle third of the page. It is very odd..."
4,Good Read,"I must say the book ended up being not what I expected, I don't want to give anything away....Funny at times, enjoyable, interesting"
2,Unimpressive,"I was underwhelmed by a book from which I great expectations. I was really looking forward to a fun romp along the lines of Ya-Ya Sisterhood, but it struck me instead as a self-serving ""coming out party"" for the author. Rather than eliciting laughs, a couple of chortles is all I could muster.We read this in a book club and all 5 members gave it a hearty ""thumbs down""."
5,Very Good Drawing Book! Recommended!,"""Draw Real People!"" is geared for those wanting to take their art work into making realistic looking faces. My whole family enjoys drawing and we have taken lessons at the local studio. This book was recommended by our instructor for the kids (12 and 16) to use during the summer, but we all found it useful.The techniques are time tested and following the instructions will result in great drawings!Highly recommended!"
3,good and bad,"Movie is good. haven't seen since it was on VHS. Couldn't get the dvd to play on my computer, nor my dvd player. Bought it new, but I'm gonna have to return this."
1,"DISNEY, STOP MAKING THESE HORRIBLE SEQUELS!","I agree with the people that gave this 1 star. I would give it 0 stars if I could. It had poor score, dialogue, animation, and songs. I don't understand why Robin Williams didn't get involved to do the voice for the Genie in the sequel. They chose the voice of Homer Simpson instead. That really disappointed me alot! Genie's voice was very annoying in the sequel. Disney really needs to stop making these horrible sequels. They are so pointless. Where's Alan Menken and Robin Williams when you need them? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON DISNEY SEQUELS. Please stick to the first ones!"
1,Worst movie ever!,I hated this film. I loved Aladdin and thought this one would be as cool as the original is. Booooy was I wrong! The sultan's eyebrows dissapear at dinner and it's just plain rotten!
4,"It was good,but not as good as the first one.","This is the sequel to the #1 film of 1992,in this movie,the evil genie Jafar is released from his lamp from a thief named Abis Mal,and he is about to use his powers of pure evil,and Iago has also been released,duh,he released himself!,and Aladdin isn't a street rat anymore,he's gonna become the Sultan's royal vizier. ""And when Aladdin becomes sultan,that will make me the grand vizier,only I'm not gonna blow it like that idiot Jafar!""-Iago,and the Genie isn't played by Robin Williams,he's played by that guy who played Homer Simpson,and it features 6 new songs!,oh,and one more thing,will they ever get rid of Jafar forever?,and there's a rule,to destroy a genie,destroy his lamp."
5,A great follow up!,"After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I was very upset on how this film was rated overall! I am 15, and have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it. Actually, I think it surpassed the orginal ""Aladdin."" I loved Iago in the first Aladdin, even though he was on Jafar's side. So, as you can guess, when he joined Aladdin and risked his life for his friends, I was really happy! Not having Robin Williams as the Genie did... but I was able to overlook it. I recommend this movie to any Aladdin fan."
1,Sigh..,"So I ordered this tank a little while ago - got here fast, no problems there. Got it filled and worked wonders the first week of play. Second week game came by and the tank starts leaking once I get it filled. I'd be paying more to ship it back then to get it repaired. So now I'm stuck with a repair bill on a new item. :\"
4,"A Reflective Journey, Thoughtful and Passionate","Understandably, this book will be difficult reading for many American readers. It is not filled with action, sex, violence, or touristic visions. It is neither efficient nor pragmatic. Nevertheless, Jose Saramago is a Nobel Prize Winner for good reason. He writes with a depth of feeling and intense love that cannot be missed. The translation loses, as most translations do, the poetic passions of the author. However, if one can accept a very different style of writing, one that is decidedly not British nor American, this work will indeed be a journey."
2,[Two-and-a-half stars] Former Hawai'i Five-0 V for Vashon star Hal Gould must have needed the work!,Look for the REAL Hal Gould in thefour Hawai'i Five-0 episodes in theV for Vashon and The Case againstMcGarrett series!
1,Halo Killer? Yeah Right.,"The creator of this game just slapped the title of ""Halo Killer"" onto this game so people will buy it.Brainwashed people will go,""Wow! Halo Killer!This game must be great."".Don't be a fool.Get Halo 2.PS:It's kind of sad that PS2 took this long to come up with a game that can even have the title of Halo Killer...Flop."
1,Sucked,This game I thought would be good but it is very annoying. In the game when you kill someone they make the same annoying sounds. They say the same things when they get hurt. They shooting was alright but not great. I just bought this game to see if I liked it but didn't. Probably won't buy killzone 2.
3,"Ehhh, not that special","Discounting the fact i tried to play this on an HDTV, and a PS3 with BC.the game looks horrible. Even set to 4:3 ratio, the game had so many jaggies and ran so choppy.this is a review for a game made of course 6 years ago.(i wanted to play this before i played Killzone 2, i also posted a review there)Pro's-Story line is cool-Lots of guns-Aiming is not that hardCon's-Controls are super clunky-no jump-no melee-Graphics are ick on HDTV-Dying and having to restart possibly 15-20 mins back drove me nuts.I maintain this game was made to kill halo. And i feel that it failed at doing so. However it did succeed at creating its own brand. Halo was made with better hardware in mind. Which i felt was a better game, considering what they had to work with."
3,"fun game for whath it is,could have been better","I just demoed the sequel and it is much better. The graphics are the best I've ever seen in the demo. I recommend playing the first one on easy if you get frustrated by check points which are far away and need to replay a long sequence over. Don't be embarrassed as it is frustrating. Try to play it as a fun single shooter and not as a Halo killer. Play it with an open mind, like a PlayStation Halo"
3,Its not Halo,"Having all of the video game systems, I'm always looking for great games. This game is touted as the PS2s answer to Halo. Halo it is not.It is NOT a bad game, and definitely is entertaining. However, if you're an Xbox owner and looking for a halo-type game on the PS2, you will be disappointed.The constant chatter amongst you and your men is annoying at best. The weapon selection could be better.Overall it is a solid game. But for those claiming it to be the Halo of PS2, I would have to disagree."
3,Killzone,"It is arguably the best FPS for PS2, but that is not saying much. It barely runs for PS2. The graphics aren't bad, but the gameplay is repetitious and boring after awhile. Also, the voice actors of the game become extremely annoying after awhile."
4,Embrace the broken mold,"This game paved the way for most first person shooters currently being released. It really drives home the idea of playing as a warrior of the future that is understandably more powerful and intimidating. I played through it twice when I first bought it, simply because I didn't feel like I'd fully scratched the itch brought on by playing it. That and I wanted a chance to take things in I missed the first go-round. The multi-player is also some of the best the PS2 has to offer. So, if you've exhausted all of the newer games available to you that make this one feel slightly dated, rest assured this is a nice throwback that is guaranteed to satisfy."
1,Overall a Real Rubbish Game,"How can a game that was meant to be a Halo killer, be as dismal as this game. The graphics are rubbish and the AI is the worse I have ever seen in a game.I played through this game, and I got to a point where the repetition just got boring. I had to go on ebay and sell it.A total waste of money and a waste of space and time.If games are really going to be this bad, then someone needs to shoot me."
1,Welcome to the Flopzone,"Only a baffoon would not see this coming. If it can't even handle Deus Ex 1 and Rainbow Six 3, what makes you think it's going to be able to run a halo clone. Call up any psychic, they'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you. Sattle up the syrup boys, we are headed to the flopzone."
3,Interesting but book could've been half as long. Racist perhaps?,"This book really touches a nerve amongst Puerto Ricans (como yo). I've entered into numerous discussions and been hit with many opinions on this book. Many feel Lewis has a motive in focusing on the ugly, and even call it racist. I think we confuse ethnic stereotypes with economic stereotypes. I found it a bit redundant though. I had some trouble keeping track of the characters as every female is a child-beating prostitute and every male is a wife-beating drunk, and found my interest waning by about page 400 of this 667-page book. The first half was interesting and heart wrenching. And of course there is the issue of the foreigner airing the dirty laundry that a lot of folks don't like. Probably the same way Jews don't like people talking about atrocities being committed in Palestine."
5,One of the best cds I own,"Excellent cd as others have noted.Most of the tracks are great.Standouts are: Air for Life, and: Can't Sleep. They are simply superb. Great music with variations of driving beats and soft interludes. Female vocals that are almost hypnotic.Track: Good for me, is great as well. Soft, with great vocals.Most of the other tracks are very good, but as noted by one of the other reviewers, I did not like voice of the male singer(s) on what otherwise would have been very good, if not great, songs."
5,Yum,This is a great cookbook. I have made so many things out of it and they are all delicious. Most of the recipes are lengthy but tasty!
4,Nice Explanations,This book is a great book for people inturested in Personality Phsychology. It gives clear explanations and if it's still unclear it will give an example or two.
4,ATV Offroad Fury 3 (By the first gy 2 review T3 Redemption),"ATV Offroad fury isn't to much different then the first one. Just new stunts, new tracks, new cars. The game is not out yet obviously but it has racing fans saving their money. Even though I have the first game the third one is worth the buy. Let me point out a few good things.1. The stunts look so cool (Dont try them at home or anywhere else!)2. The backround music is never badHere is the only thing thats bad.1. It's kind of like a repeat of the first one except for better.That's all that I know about the game but I am finding out more!"
1,wow,this game is such a let down its not even funny.You'd think that with all the cool parts u can buy and stuff itd make a difference the way the bikes acts and all....NOPE. Its so funny because half the pipes on that game either ive seen and heard or rode on the acutal quad itself so i had an expectancy.A friend of mine has a Titanium 4 just like what u can get in the game and the quad is deafining loud in the game its exactly the same as if it had the same pipe it started with another thing THERE ARE NO REAL QUADS IN THE GAME! i've only heard of K&K and thats the only real one i know of in the game The only thing i do like is the powerslide but thats not even realistic so the game all around blows
3,THE RAINBOW HAS DISSSPEARD,"The ATV games were something to remember. Blazing around on a ATV, soring over canyons and natrual bridges, the games were instant classics. RAINBOW STUDIOS published the first two but sony dumpped them for climax because they were making ATV VS. MX UNLEASED with THQ.I have loved the series since ATV 1 but now i despise climax. Why because they ruined this game I will now compare the first two ATV games to the thrid.1&2 great graphics3 what happened?1&2 preloading gave you an extra 50 feet to fly3 preloading gives you an extra 2 feet1&2 challenging ai but fun to verse3 too challenging or too easy ai1&2 great trick system no stoppes, bicycles, or backflips3 all tricks with backflips stoppes and bicycles1&2 great fun *****3 wa wa wa boo hoo ***As you can see i love rainbow but it has faded. But wait ATV VS MX is now here. THe rainbow has appeared again for ATV fans."
1,Deadly boring,"I purchased this book at a library book sale where I got a whole box of romances for $1.00. Boy, am I glad I didn't pay full price for this book as trying to read it was like wading through mud. Dull, plodding story line and nothing to make me like or empathize with the characters."
3,Somewhat good,"I somewhat enjoyed this story. It was a bit unrealistic in some cases. And the woman, Noramary Marsh, seems to have to backbone in which to stand up for herself. She gives up the man she loves, Robert Stedd, to fill the spot of her older reckless step-sister,Winnie, who left Duncan Montrose for another man. She marries Duncan without a complaint to anyone because her stepmother wishes her to, and says she loves him. It is all just really unbelievable that she could get over her first true love so quickly. I would recommend reading this book at the library first before buying it."
3,What's on it,"This contains:Reaching For The Moon (1930 1hr 12min b/w)Road To Hollywood (musical biopic of life of Bing Crosby 53min b/w)Road To Bali (1953 1hr 30min Color)Approx. 16 minutes of Bing Crosby TrailersHigh SocietyWe're Not DressingRhythm on the RiverBirth of the BluesStar Spangled RhythmWhite ChristmasTotal playing time 3hr 49minSt. Clair Vision1 disk multi-regional (1-8) (dual layer single sided)Reaching for the Moon is early Bing Crosby video is fair to poor, sound ok.Road to Bali is the best of the lot."
3,Not bad - good for a casual read,"The Stand, Swan Song.... then I read Fire. It was ok - kind of a creepy story (a virus that re-animates meat... ugh), but neat how it all comes together in the end. It seemed to me that Stewart rushed through the last third of the book - he had the right idea and was going along ok, but I kinda got the feeling he had a deadline to meet or something. Lots of half-developed characters leaves you feeling a bit at a loss when you finally put the book down. All in all not a bad read."
1,Rip-Off Alert!,"If you already own the excellent 6-disc Ernie Kovacs set that Shout Factory released last year, do NOT buy this disc. This release is nothing more than Disc #5 of that six-disc set repackaged, even to the extent of printing a new label on the disc itself. When you pop it into your dvd player, it will come up as ""Disc 5"" of that set. I can't believe Shout Factory is pulling this kind of nonsense. I have been very pleased with their product offerings in the past, but I guess those days are over -- I will be very leery of future Shout Factory offerings for fear that they are nothing but retreads of what I already own. Shame on you Shout Factory!"
1,Not what it's advertised as,Thi DVD has some great music and scenery but it doesn't tell what the scenery is! I thought there was a narrative
2,kind of useless size,"I think they were over generous with their measurements, these are tiny ramekins. Not sure how useful they will be beyond using them for dipping ketchup. Also had a funny smell when I unpacked the box. Wouldn't buy this brand again."
2,"really, really tiny","I'm an experienced Amazon buyer, but sometimes I just don't get the dimensions right. I didn't visualize these correctly and they were far smaller than I expected. I don't actually know what anyone would use them for, I was going to use them for individual creme brulees but they felt too small for that. So unless you have a specific idea of what you are going to put into these tiny dishes, try one size up. I actually returned them, and Amazon, as always, was very gracious in it's return policy (arrived well packed, no damage)"
1,"Terrible Shipping, Still Waiting for Replacement of Damaged Product","""New"" book arrived so badly damaged we had to send it back; still awaiting a replacement for this Christmas gift."
2,My cat loved the smell!,"My Persian absolutely loved and went crazy over the smell - at first, that is... But then... there was a let down. You see, my Persian is a finicky cat, who only wants to eat dry food. Unfortunately, Kitty Kaviar only enticed him into eating the wet food that I was trying to entice him into eating for only about 2 or 3 feedings. By about the sixth or seventh feeding with the Kitty Kaviar he had completely snubbed his nose at it.Still, I must admit that I haven't found anything that worked better. I would encourage people to give Kitty Kaviar a try, because of the fact that was the very best response from my finicky cat that I ever gotten.P.S. My other cat, who is an American Shorthair, and normally likes to eat anything I give her, LOVED and RAGED over the smell of it as I served it to her one time - but she didn't eat very much of it - so I haven't mixed it with her food any more since that one time."
3,Great for the 2 weeks they stayed put.,"Work well if you can slide the curtain in properly. Did the trick for the first 2 weeks, but at the first tug at the curtain the glued pieces of the clip came apart. Recommend these if you have an edge that will not be disturbed."
3,Bubble Gum Pop at Its Finest,"No Angels is the result of the German Equivalent to the ""Pop Stars"" series, except while we were still making the cut here in the states, ""Daylight"" was at the top of the Euro-Charts. It's a catchy tune that is light on substance and heavy on fluff...bubble gum pop at its finest. I am surprised it hasn't taken off over here yet, but as the singers haven't really done anything else I am not sure there's the support to try to launch them here in the states."
5,If it weren't true.....,"you might think it too contrived. This is an intriguing story, incredibly well written, by one of the best authors of the period. The story concerns the German government's double-dealing during WWI and their efforts to keep the U.S. out of the European theater by any means possible. To tell more would be unfair to the reader of this review, but suffice it to say that this roughly 200 page paperback is a one day read that will leave you well informed and most entertained."
5,History and anecdotes,"Barbara Tuchman is one of the leading historians of the 20th century ; she proves it here once more. In this book she manages to use an anecdote - the telegram - to explain in a thrilling and convincing way the reasons for the US to enter the war. It is a brilliant book thanks to her remarkable style which blends suspense and clarity and yet no compromise with historical truth.Many historians are experts and have a vast knowledge of their subject. Very few like Barbara Tuchman make their knowledge accessible in an enticing way to the ""man in the street""."
2,Re: D.G.,"""Pacifist Woodrow Wilson?"" Please refer to Walter Karp's exhaustively researched, ""The Politics of War"" regarding Wilson's machinations toward war. Pacifist... Ha!"
2,Who is MicroPlus?,"I work tech support for a computer retailer.Had a user call in on this card, little documentation on it, just 3 files ont he install CD-Rom. An EXE file and 2 *.bin files.After 40 minutes of ripping out existing USB driver then re-installign them off the CD we were not able to get anywhere further than the user had originally proceeded.The driver installation went smooth and there were no conflicts or problems w/ windows not finding the driver. Everything seemed to install according to plan yet when you plug in a USB device .. nothing.Your resutls may vary and the card may work just fine in another version of Widnows, but aparantly not Win98SE."
1,A triumph of hype over reality,"I'd heard a lot about this artist, and thought that there must be some substance to the hype, but alas, such is not the case. Cincotti's voice is bland and poorly controlled, and his piano playing pedestrian. Such songs as ""I Love Paris"" and ""Bali Hai"" are almost laughable. Too bad that this young man became a star before he's had a chance to develop his modest talents."
3,"Nice job, but not jazz","If you're looking for some quasi-jazz, pop-music, reminiscent of Michael Buble and Norah Jones, then you've found it in Peter Cincotti's ON THE MOON. I enjoy listening to it , but not for the same reasons that Cincotti's self-titled debut has become one of my favorite albums. The sophomore project lacks the quality of Cincotti's first project; the driving bass that embellished many of the songs on the first album seems to have disappeared as have Cincotti's timeless vocals. The very timbre of his voice seems different from track to track on the new album. The song selection seemed hopeful, paraticularly the first track, which is the best track from ON THE MOON, but it's downhill from there for individuals looking for a good contemporary jazz album. I'll still listen to ON THE MOON, and enjoy it, but it is a disappointment after Cincotti's smashing debut."
3,Surprising,Pretty good. Don't think I was ready for who don it. Thought it was totally someone else. Not a bad read.
4,Lots of twists and turns,There were so many twists and turns in this book that it was almost annoying. I'd rather see more effort put into the plot and less into the surprises and plot twists.
2,Extremely disappointed,"I purchased this book as a birthday present to myself. It arrived early but held off reading it until May. Huge disappointment as I have already read this book!!!! I read so many books, that I cannot remember all the titles. I was under the impression that this was a new book from Dr. Gerritson, not one published in 1993. I really feel as though this was a huge scam."
3,A little too much contrived romance,I have been reading Tess Gerritsen's Rizzoli and Isles series and thought perhaps this book would be similar but I found this one to be a bit too romantic for my taste. It was almost predicable what would eventually occur between the two primary characters but the conclusion was still surprising. A good read but I won't read it again as I have some of her other books.
5,Presumed Guilty,I absolouly love all of Tess Gerritsen's Books . She is a great writer. I really like the rizzoli & Isles series
3,Good solid rock and roll,"While the best song on the album is the title track (and what an amazing, beautiful song it is), as an album it is only good. Definitely not a masterpiece, but very listenable."
3,This DVD consists of three movies,"There are 3 movies in this DVD, the last two are really good, the first one is only average."
3,I haven't purchased the box set,"I haven't purchased the box set and don't remember the movies Angel Face or Macao but the others I must agree are only average with the exception of The Yakuza. I have been wanting to own this for years and greatly appreciate the chance. I bought it as a single and the delivery date keeps getting pushed back but I can't wait to get it. It was written by Robert Towne before Chinatown (I think) and is nearly comparable. As for Farewell My Lovely - well I would rather have had that than some of the others in the set, but it would not have spurred me to buy it."
5,MOTHER GOOSE by Mary Engelbreit's:,"love it , love it , love it.has beautiful color pictureswhat a classic!Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose: One Hundred Best-Loved Verses"
5,This was facinating!!!,I was able to capture this show on the Nat Geo Channel. It was facinating information and features the only living person alive that was on the Titanic. A must see.
1,damaged and defective even after repurchasing,"I'm usually very pleased with my amazon purchases, however, I purchased this video for my son who is really into the Titanic but the item was defective. I had to reorder the documentary again. When it arrived it was also defective and could not be watched. I have never seen a look of disappointment such as I did today. I will never order another video from amazon. I even purchased a third, different one and it too was damaged. So now I literally feel like I threw away my money three times over. You really ruined the experience and did not even take measures to prevent it from happenig more than once. What horrible experience and lack of service. Thank you very much."
4,Titanic How it really sank,I thought also this was quite good i like it and i enjoyed it very much so
3,"GOOD FILM, BUT NOT GREAT!",Super sexy is the term I'd use to describe this film. The good looking girl is absolutely good looking and just so sexy. Sexy Sexy Sexy is all I'll say about it. Forget the story cause you wont need it with this film. SEXY!!!!!
2,Missed the mark!!,"Lots of hype, but missed the mark. This could have been a great movie, but they held back. Not worth getting, rent it if you can find it!!"
3,"Fun characters, solid gameplay, TOO MUCH RACING","J2 set a new standard for game versatility. It had racing, shooting, action platform, puzzle, jetboarding, and strategy. Every kind of gameplay was represented and that was what made it stand out. J3 on the other hand is 75% racing. Since I'm not a huge racing fan, it hurts the game a little for me.Don't get me wrong. The game is fun, and judging it on its merits alone, it deserves 4 stars. But I had expectations that simply were not met. J3 is a victim of its amazing predecessor.The storyline isn't as strong either, and the final revelation about the Precursors, while cute doesn't fit with elements of the previous games. But that's not important, and if the game was more fun, I'd easily forgive the story problems.I do recommend it. If you like racing, you'll probably enjoy it. If you don't, you'll probably still enjoy it, though not as much. But it's just a bit of a letdown."
4,jal 3 for playstation 2,"This game is definitely worthy buying, but it is too much of the characters fights comparing with jak and daxter previous games. I would like to see more challenging puzzles in the game. However, I must admit that it is superbly done."
1,not that on it,i rented this game and was not that fun at all. they started me out with a short training level and then took me into an un fun warior shot out. with out going from easy to hard. so thats why gave this game 1 star.
4,JessEm reducer collar does the job..,"The 3-1/2"" reducer collar to adapt my Bosch router to the Mast-R-Lift worked just as it's supposed to. If you get the Mast-R-Lift, make sure you check the listing to see whether you'll need a collar or not."
4,Stereo Wire Harness for Toyota Camry 83-83,This worked great and was easy for my son to intall and he was a first timer. Didn't take much time either.
1,Buyer Beware,"This product does not support all the operating systems that it puports.This is a copy of the email I recieved from the company.Hello,Verb Clinic is not actually supported on Windows 98. We have had somereports of it working, but are not able to provide support for it,unfortunately.Thanks,NAdine--------------------Nadine MohamedTechnical SupportKairos Information TechnologyCairo, Egypt[...]Tech support like that is not worth a hill of beans. If Verb Clinic will not install I am sure this product will not install so would not recommend this product as they are using their customers as beta-Testers."
5,Selleck is Jesse Stone,"I have the entire series to date. My only comment is why can't they make more than one movie a year? Tom Selleck always delivers great performances. You can rest assured his involvement in a project will keep the material clean, interesting without lowering to sexual stunts Hollywood is prone to pull for an audience. I've enjoyed this series. I hope they continue to produce this character. If Blue Bloods ever ends- get Selleck to do this for network TV."
5,"Jessie Stone - Night Passage, Sea Change, Death in Paradise, etc","I lucked into this movie and immediately began a search for any others in this series. I've since purchased all that are available and have not been disappointed on any aspect of each movie. Tom Selleck is excellent as the aging small town Police Chief complete with the quick wit we remember from him in his Magnum series. The plot was thorough, suspenseful and well written; each actor was cast perfectly for his/her role and the entire production well above todays standards. I found it suitable to view with my grown children and grandchildren, in mixed company, etc - no gratuitous obsenity, violence, sex, etc. A welcome relief from the mostly trash that the movie industry is projecting on us today. Simpley a good, well acted, well written 2 hours of entertainment showing much of the beautiful New England setting and one that I will watch again many times."
4,Good Show,I have watched a few of these movies in the past and felt they would be a good add on in my collection.
1,Don't Bother!,The price was cheap and the quality was even cheaper. I wasn't expecting a top of the line mirror for the price but this is far worse than I imagined. The light gives and orange cast and the plastic construction is so cheap. It took about 3 days for the light cover to fall off.
1,Low price but awful recording,"The cover is very nice and the compositions are beautiful, but the recording is terrible. The harpsichord sounds more like a square piano."
3,Granddaughter's,This was for a class that my granddaughter is taking. She is not overwhelmed with it but says the book is okay.
4,Good product,Bought this item about a month ago. I've noticed a difference after washing it and applying this lotion to it. Just a pea size amount. It's helped with keeping it shinny and with less friz. Would recommend this product.
4,Nice,"The best way to use this product is applying it to your dry hair, it will make it so soft and shiny.Its very nice!"
3,Comparable to drugstore smoothers,"I bought this thinking it was going to be a lot better than it turned out to be. I read so many good reviews, so I had high hopes for this product. I use a pea size amount, sometimes a bit more, on my mid-back length layered hair. I find that it does a nice job of keeping the frizzies at bay (my hair tends to frizz horrendously at even the slightest bit of humidty). However, it did not ""blow me away"" as much as a product of this cost, and brand/reputation should have. I have some less expensive smoothing/anti-frizz/glossing products that I've bought from the drugstore for < $10 each, and they do a pretty similar job. At least this stuff seems to last a looong time, due to it's 7 oz size bottle and the fact that you only use a tiny amount for each application."
4,GREAT PRODUCT / Fekkai Advanced Brilliant Glossing Cream,"MAKES HAIR SOFT, NICE SHINE, AND NO FRIZZ.HAIR IS SMOOTH WHEN YOU USE A FLAT IRON,IT MAKES IT JUST LIKE SILK. BUT ONLY USE THEAMOUNT RECOMMENDED, TO MUCH WILL MAKEYOUR HAIR FALL FLAT AND GREASY. THIS CONTAINSOLIVE OIL IN IT, SO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.RECEIVED WITHIN A FEW DAYS, FAST SERVICE."
5,Miracle cream,"This stuff is the best! I got a sample tube and it lasted me forever, and I'm so glad I found it. I've used tons of different shine and anti-frizz creams and this is the only one that makes your hair perfect without leaving residue or weighing it down! All you need is a tiny bit and it goes a long way. I love it!"
4,Informative,I like the way this book is laid out. Lots of information and easy to cross reference for different needs. Also like the section that shows how to make tinctures etc. Very well illustrated.
4,Excellent Overall Guide,"The book has excellent pictures, excellent how to illustrations, good selection of items listed (no guide is a complete list), information is accurate. Useful for anyone who is learning how to utilise herbal remedies that are well documented historic uses. Excellent cross referrence to the diffent historic herbal treatment school of thoughts. Great cross between a coffee table book and text book. Only complaint...I would like a complete encyclopedia set of all know herbs done like this!"
1,"important topics, poor writing","The important topics that Abejas broaches can not override the overall flawed structure, lazy sentences, and underdeveloped characters. Lousy writing."
5,Outstanding optics,"Going back to my days with film cameras, I've always found macro lenses extremely useful. This Olympus lens is up there with the best of the best. Outstanding image quality and very well made."
5,Amazing,Is there anything that this guide doesn't cover? If you are writing a theological thesis or religious paper of any sort this is the guide that I would recommend (of course you need to use your institution's required structure - in my case the evil Turabian).
3,An easy fun read,"I received this book on a Monday evening and was finished by Wednesday morning. Although the author's personal story sometimes gets in the way, overall it's an accessible interesting read. The pen pictures of the seven interview subjects are by far the best part. Albeit etched with a little acid, they project a general sense of fairness --- the Frankie Laine portrait being perhaps the one exception. Of the seven, Pat Boone comes across as the most integrated fully rounded personality, truly someone who seems to bear no grudges or in any way feel intimidated by his many critics. Good for him!Now how about the author letting us have a follow-up with the rest of her interview material?"
1,Not so tremendous,Does Charley mention in his books how he hated to pay bills. He wanted VHS tape reproduced by a local video production company back in the 1980s and after the order was complete he would only pay a fraction of the quoted price. You cheap B@$t@rd. I have heard this was typical of his business dealings.
4,nice job,"I really enjoyed this book because it was exciting, different, and had many new characters. It kept my interest throughout and it had a great plot. A truly enjoyable Buffy book that I would highly recommnend."
1,Didn't fit,"Parts didn't fit my truck, had to re-install my old broken lock cylinders. Wasn't my fault, Amazon said the part would fit."
5,How is this priced so low?,"Look this up on oscar schmidt website, the suggested retail is 350. Its definitely worth $250. Is this mispriced?The tuners, abalone inlay, and finish alone are worth $100 on any instrument. Whatever you planned on getting as a beginner or intermediate uke, abort mission and switch to this one."
4,Great Rating from a Marginally Qualified Rater,"I bought my first beginner ukulele only six months ago, but enjoyed enough that I decided to move up from the toy class to something a little better. The OU5 was on sale at under a hundred dollars, but I have to say that the leap in quality and sound far outweighed the $70 price difference between this and my first ukulele. Like others who have rated Oscar Schmidt products, I have been impressed by the beautiful finish of this instrument, but it's the improved action and sound quality that totally won me over. Go ahead and buy your $20 Rogue instrument to see if you like the ukulele, but when you're ready to step up to the next level (but perhaps aren't ready to shell out $250), this is a solid stepping stone. I'm really happy with this instrument. Keep your really cheap one to take to the beach, though. You'll like this one enough that you won't want someone grinding sand into the finish or spilling beer on it."
4,concert ukulele,"This Oscar Schmidt is beautiful. It's the perfect size for me. The action is a little high for my taste, but other than that, sounds wonderful. It is quite satisfactory for my needs at this time. It would do better to come with a little zipper up case/cover of some kind. I'm pleased with this, I have noticed them at Costco for a little less, but didn't feel at all like I was overpaying for what I've got."
2,Disappointing,"This book tries hard. It tries to be cool, hip, attractive, fashionable - in short, coffee table worthy. To some degree it succeeds, but it's not a very good book on Indoor Gardening. In fact, it wastes the reader's time with large sections on arranging plants in the home, illuminating plants for maximum dramatic effect and arranging dried flowers. It does get around to plants here and there, but they seem to be thought of - as a bit of an inconvieance.It is an attractive book and those looking for a cheap, small, coffee table book can add a star or two to this review. For those looking for a really good book on indoor gardening and/or indoor plants - keep on looking."
5,JOS A BANK - CORDUROY SLACKS,I was very pleased with the quality of the slacks received. I have shopped at Joseph A Banks before but it didn't dawn on me to check their web site for these items. The quality was as promised and the items were received as promised. Definitely 5 stars!
3,Stuck in the Middle,"What happens when your parents break up? What if they were not married in the eyes of the law, and one of them has no biological or legal claim to you?Ever since he was little, Nick has been teased because he has two moms. Nick's mothers taught him not to be ashamed of his parentage, no matter what others said. Though it is hard for him to deal with bullies and name-calling at school, Nick is pretty happy when he is home.Happy, that is, until his moms split up. Nick stays at home with Erin - who he calls Mom, who he's always called Mom, because she biologically is just that - while Jo gets an apartment of her own.As always, Julie Anne Peters has written a realistic, dramatic story. Children of divorce will benefit from reading this book just as much as those who are products of a same-sex marriage. Hopefully, this and other stories by Peters will encourage readers to be more open-minded and more compassionate towards others."
4,Good Book,"Must have for first time com programmers - but beware that the book is dated - everyone should be using ATL3.0 now, and this book pre-dates ATL. Very nice intro into the COM basics -- will do well as a prep for 2nd and 3rd bood (look at beginning atl com by grimes, and his advanced professional atl com after you have read this one cover to cover)"
3,"Pretty decent, hard to follow at times though","I actually would've given this book 3 1/2 stars had it let me. As everyone has mentioned, the book is really good at explaining the fundamentals. I didn't like the examples very much though. When I read a book I REALLY study the book. I like to type in ALL the code for EVERY sample. I find I learn them better and understand the example programs much better if I actually type them in myself. If you don't type them in it is all too easy to just glance at them and say ""Ok, it works. Cool."" and flip the page. In this book he'll give the listing of maybe one file for each sample and the rest are on the CD. I don't like that. I like to be able to have the entire listing for every program right there in front of me in print. And once you get to chapter 8 on Aggregation and Containment it becomes almost necessary. But that's just me."
5,Legendary Littmann Quality,Perfect pediatric stethoscope with great acoustics. Works well in the EMS pre ospital setting for lung sounds and vital signs.
5,As good as expected!,"The sthetoscope is exactly what I expected. It is one of the best for pediatric purposes. However, I would recommend that Amazon offer the pssibility of inscribing the name of the owner. This service is inexpensive and very convenient."
1,unconfortable,"the product that i request is not get yet, please review your order and resend it to me i will wait one week more."
2,Timex vs. Seiko....Fight!!!,"Compared to Timex, Seiko falls on the sword every time.Timex Indiglo Highschool Rulz!"
4,Christina does it again,Wow! Christina Aguilera has done it again! Another successful music release. I like most of the songs on here and the translations of her famous chart toppers are great. At times she sounds very forced in speaking spanish. 4 stars for this one!
5,Christina Aguilera is amazing!,"I am so happy to find a nineteen year old singer that is actually talented. I am a nineteen year old female and would like to find someone to listen to who is like me, but able to sing. I love every song on this cd. I have only a small knowledge of the spanish language but enough to understand what is being said. The lyrics are amazing and ""Una Mujer"" is better than the original ""What a Girl Wants"". Christina gets 5 stars as a singer and role model."
2,Not as good as ya might think,"Well, In my PERSONAL opinion, this cd is just one more nail in the coffin for Christina. Her accent is a little off as expected, but I can tell one of the only reasons this was realeased was to keep Christina from fading away like she has started to do. I mean, Mandy tried to do the same with a special edition album, and its a flop. Anyway, most of the songs are kinda boring. She's got her OK ones, but she obviouly tries too hard to show off her voice. Sorry to those die hard Christina fans, but I wouldn't recommend this."
4,Bravo!,"The Spanish language sounds beautiful, almost as if the 5 songs from Christina's self-titled debut which appear here in the language were originally written in it. Christina shines on ""Mi Reflejo"". The title song is the most beautiful. You can definitely tell that Christina's voice has matured since her first album. The songs are fun, flirty, and her voice sounds amazing. Even if you aren't a Spanish speaker, you will be able to appreciate how wonderful her voice sounds on this recording, and the emotion she puts into each vocal line."
2,hispanic please,"first of all miss aguilera don't know what race she wants to be. first she swore up and down she was hispanic, yeah right, dated enrique just so she could learn spanish culture, now i hear she claims she has a black father, skank please i know a person of black descent when i see one and sad to see christina is'nt black or hispanic so girl next time you wanna tell lies be more creative."
1,"Christina Aguilera's ""Mi Reflejo"" Review","Don't get this. I don't recommend this at all. It's in a different language and I guarantee half of the people in America don't speak Spanish or whatever language is on this CD. I know fans are gonna say, ""ooohh, I wonder what she sounds like in spanish"" well to me its nothing special. I know it might sound like I'm bashing the album but in about 2 years from now, this CD will be wiped off. This should of been better off released as an import rather than in America where people speak in american. This album won't get her anywhere, no more respect than she has now. That's just my opinion."
5,excellent Latin pop album!,"This album is such an amazing pleasure to my ears. I don't speak Spanish fluently but I know what my ears hear and this album is so much better than her English debut. Unlike the first album, this doesn't have any bubble gum song, every song is amazingly sung and written. I almost cry when I hear the way she sings ""Contigo En La Distancia"" and ""Pero Me Acuerdo De It"", she sings with so much passion and love that she can really make you feel it. I have nothing bad to say about this album...truly amazing!"
4,super game until you get into the alien ship!!,i really liked the game a lot most of the time. But some how after the alien space floating; i lost totaly intreast in the action.looked stupid to me. Played the game on medium setting on a dual core Quad g-force 8600GT.It was fine. to bad the aliens turned out that boring.
2,"Crysis: has promise, then justs gets tedious","The game starts out fun, the usual fighting, tank battle, sniper kind of mix. Challenging FPS, then it goes alien. While graphically cool, it completely loses touch in the CORE (interesting that the core of the CD sucks). After you finally get out of the CORE, its fun again for a sequence, until you have to fly the VTOL. What a piece of junk. Unfortunately, the game is weaved through with tedious boring frustrating sequences (example, flying a VTOL in windy weather battling aliens who fly faster, turn better...). I finally gave up deciding that a game this frustrating wasn't worth playing. Oh one other thing, you better have a VERY fast CPU and at least a GEForce 8800 NVIDA card to play this game or you'll have LOTS of skipping and stop action (not the kind of stopping you want). I would pass on this game which not rotten at the CORE, but certainly is wormy."
2,Disapointing,"Crysis is billed as ""from the makers of Farcry"". Ubisoft, the Farcry developer, is not involved, so don't expect it to be a follow-up of Farcry.Many bugs, some tedious section, not what I expected from all of the hype (that's my fault I guess). I liked Farcry better."
5,"Old Game, still better than the new JUNK!","This game is finally playable in maxed out mode with my current high end hardware. My pc is full gaming rig and runs it well. I remember when it came out, It would not play well at all on my cool gaming rig of the time. Now it does, years later and it is awsome. Not some stupid console port! A real computer game for real computer gamers. Now I already know what all the console fan bois are going to say, so dont waste our time on this PC review. Most real pc gamers dont even care what console gamers think, period. It simply is not comparable. THis game has great action, great weapons, fun driving and swimming. I really cheered when I shot my first heli down. It is cheap too! I am running gtx 470 video, i7 socket 1366 on x58 with triple channel ddr3 and all ssd system. It rocks and looks fantastic. Cheers!"
1,Cray Supercomputer Required!!!,"Listen, I am sick and tired of seeing the ads for this game in magazines and on the web. If you see them then you are forced to believe that the graphics shown are actually attainable. They are not. Yes, the graphics are ""amazing"" but only if you have a Cray supercomputer to run the game on. This is very upsetting to me. My system is very solid and I refuse to be forced to ""dummy down"" my graphics settings to play a $50 game. Doing so makes it look like FarCry from 5 years ago. Obviously, the graphics you see in the ads cannot be run on most machines...even gaming enthusiast's machines. So, why buy this game if you cannot enjoy its biggest asset (great graphics)???There are no graphic optimizations done by this company. What a let down.Also, anyone who has played Battlefield 2142 knows that EA does not support multiplayer at all. It barely has forums on its website. You can forget any meaningful technical support from this company."
5,"Don't Buy it, SecuRom DRM infected","This game looks nice but is infected with SecuRom to the point it cause my DVD drive to knock badly. I did a net search and I am not alone with this issue. EA games does not care, they already got my cash.Get STALKER 1 & 2 patch them (They are buggy without the patches) and they are way better anyway."
1,"They call it Crysis, because you WILL cry at how badly it runs.","This review is in response to all those Gamer ""Elitists"" saying that this or that guys computer sucks, and it's NOT the game.Well guess what they are wrong it IS the game. I have a OC E6600, Vista 64, 4gb or Ram 8800GTS(G92,512mbOC)and I get about 25 fps with everything on high 1440x900 no AA, and it dips in Firefight to the low teens, unplayable. Forget about ultra high, thats a slideshow, my video card hadn't even been on the market when this game came out, and my card at this resolution is in the top 5 made.Not to mention the serious bugs, bad handling vehicle's and bad voice work.Not that I completely hate the game, but it seems Crysis is just a Tech Demo for the engine."
2,No support,This game was great to play. Unfortunately the official patches refused to work. I can still play this game but only at original retail version.EA has been no help at all. They really dont seem to care.I will be avoiding EA games in the future. EA PC games just dont seem to work right anymore and Iam tired of wasting my money on games that wont work.
3,It was up until they ran out of idea,"The game starts good. It is good, really, right until you got in contact with the aliens.And then, they ran out of ideas. Boring levels, boring goals, boring ending.And the last enemy was just ridiculous.They simply ran out of ideas and could not give a decent ending."
3,Not what I expected in a paramilitaristic FPS,"it's good up till the point where you go inside the mine, then it turns into an alien science fiction stuff and the graphics aren't as good. The rest of the game is overly difficult, for no reason other than just becuase it's a higher level, it's supposed to be difficult. The graphics in the beginning are incredible however."
3,"Heechee good, Freud bad","A common plot feature of some of the most compelling science fiction novels I have read is a mysterious alien civilization - a vast black box that the author reveals in tiny but tantalizing snippets. Pohl does this masterfully in Gateway; it is probably the novel's best feature. The worst feature is undoubtedly the unintentionally hilarious psychoanalysis the protagonist undergoes. It sounds so outdated and is such a stilted and cheap way to try and develop a character that it prevents the book, in my opinion, from being an enduring classic. That said, I devoured the book in only two sittings. It is engaging, moves at a fast pace, and contains many interesting asides about astronomy and ""xenoanthropology"". The characters are believable and not just adventure story archetypes. Read it!"
2,pop psychology produces poor plots,"this is a disappointing read: here is a new idea (the mysterious hechee artifact) turned into a muddled story with questionable motivation (guilt-in-your-face) and terrible structure (alternating flashbacks and current time--so there is no suspence, you see). Characters are what saves this books from taking one star."
5,"Creative story, great writing","From the mold of early Heinlein, Clark, and Asimov, Pohl is a science fiction reader's writer. While weaving a fantastic work of fiction he keeps readers' minds alert with a healthy dose of edgy science."
4,"One of the best trilogy-first science-fiction, after RAMA !","It takes you away with the first page till the last one.The story is tiled in such a way that you want to go to thenext chapter wishing not to be the last one !The human protagonist Robinette is introduced with periodicalflashbacks but in a consistent and fluctuant fashion.I began to read in the morning and when finished ran to thebookstore to buy the second of the trilogy:""Beyond the Blue Event Horizon""...and read it non-stop till 4:00am !!!You may read my review for the second book here too..Now looking forward for the third book to be translated inmy native language:""Heechee Rendezvous"""
1,Foul mouthed,"Wow! I listened to the audio version ripping Jesus name left and right, like eh no big deal. I'm trying to build a list of books that don't, for those that care."
1,Geo's Tome,This does not help anyone. Everyone around me is committing suicide to this book. It's awful... awfully good... awfully good to die to.
3,Comic Book,I thought this was going to be the Jules Verne novel with some illustrations to go with it. It's a glorified comic book.
3,the book is in the form of a comic,"I bought this version of Tom Sawyer thinking that it would be the original story accompnied by illustrations, it turned out to be entirely a comic book based on the original story, my daughter enjoyed it though and thought it was fun."
1,this book is garbage,"Lauffer, writes a simple, and useless tactical book. Its contents could have been written by a 10 year old girl. After seing this man coach in action, he is complete crap and should never ever be giving advice to ANYONE on the game,cheers"
4,Old Mac Boots,"This is my second pair of Old Macs. I love them for those rides where the ground is just a bit too rocky to be comfortable for my otherwise barefoot horse.My only complaint is that these boots arrived with a kink/fold in the inner flap that surrounds the hoof wall. This made the boots extremely difficult to secure once on. They rubbed a bit on the hoof wall that first ride, but the kink worked itself out and is no longer an issue. I'm very relieved about that as I probably would not use them at all if the kink had stayed."
4,Great even if you're not pregnant,"Fantastic cookbook and helpful nutritional advice and information for each recipe. I have made about 7 recipes from this book, and so far and every one has turned out great. My favorites so far are the Tamale Pie and the Potato Kale Quiche, which are really easy and even my meat-eating husband loved them. I feel they really tested the recipes (in a normal kitchen, vs. with commercial equipment) prior to publication, which with many cookbooks I've bought, this is clearly not the case. It's a nice mix of exotic and mainstream vegetarian recipes. I rated it 4 stars because I would probably not make some of the recipes with tempeh and some ingredients I have never heard of. However, the majority of the recipes in this book incorporate staples readily available in your regular grocery store. I will continue to use this cookbook long after my son is born."
2,"Great concept, but......","This is a great book in theory. Jammed pack full of information, but if you are looking for consistent, exceptional tasting recipes, please look elsewhere. The recipes are uninteresting and bland. I bought this book based on its wonderful reviews. I was very disappointed when I actually started to cook from this book. I am no novice in the kitchen and have been cooking for many years. I keep coming back to this cookbook because of its potential and hoping/praying that the results will be better this time. But, nothing changes. The food isn't great. This book is going back onto the high shelf in my kitchen where I can't reach it and can collect dust. Sorry folks."
5,I Want To See More AC Adapters Like This For More Radios,"I want to see more AC adapters like this for most radio products just like the FR-200 such as the Grundig G3, G5, G6, G8, S-350DL. Those aftermarket AC adapters DO damage these radios, I want something that meets the specs and makes the product last longer. I had to get a OEM approved power supply netbook from here, why can I just simply buy an AC adapter for my special portable radios???"
3,Not a complete collection,"This humorous collection gives a good overview of Kovacs' comedy, but it is far from being a complete collection. I can recall several skits from my misspent youth watching Ernie on the family Black & White set which are not in this collection."
5,The most complete Ernie TV set...ever!,"I used have (and nearly wore out) a VHS copy of ""The Best of Ernie Kovacs."" When this DVD set came out I jumped on it! I am so pleased that Edie Adams had the foresight to save all the material that otherwise network television would have ultimately scrapped.Most intriguing for me are the earliest shows. Since Ernie was on television in it's infancy, and a few years before I was born, the shows from the mid-1950s were all new to me and very funny, free-wheeling zaniness. The way he played with the camera, the sets, recovered from gags that didn't go right on live TV, all made me admire his comic brain even more. He's been called a genius and these shows will remind you why.A wonderful collection for any Kovacs fan!"
5,PERFECT KOVACS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!,"This boxed set came as a surprise to me. I had no idea it was being compiled and put together. It expands and expounds greatly on White Star's ""Best of Ernie Kovacs"" set which was first released on VHS over 20 years and which contained knock 'em dead rock 'em sock 'em blackout material. This new ""Ernie Kovacs Collection"" is slower in approach...entire episodes from Kovac's morning and summer replacement shows are featured, as well as never-seen home movies, silent movies and behind-the-scenes out-takes. This set is further proof that Ernie Kovacs was a deeply funny and humorous and witty and clever performer, writer and director. It's a great addition to the White Star material and definitely stands on it's own as a mammoth tribute to a mammoth talent. Thanks, Ernie! DORF!"
2,Pointless mess,"Ultimately, ""Ghost Rider"" neither succeeds as a good movie or an entertaining bad movie. The pacing is awful, and the story nonexistent. What kind of movie wastes the gonzo talents of both Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda? This one. What kind of movie wastes the comic genius of Donal Logue? This one. A great cast is squandered in a morass of senseless story. ""Ghost Rider"" is badly written and badly directed. If you must watch this, rent and don't buy. And be prepared to nap in the middle."
1,Condition,It was used. Next time you put something in sale plz let the people know if is truly new. The dvd box came with marks all over the front.
3,Ghost Rider,I thought the story line was interesting and the acting was good. I also enjoyed the special effects. Eva was as lovely as ever.
3,Silly but Amusing,"The special effects are wonderful. The main character, the biker rider with the on-fire skull is original. There's not much character development as in Spider man 2. The fighting scenes are not as fantastic either.Overall it's worth watching twice."
4,Great Movie Set,This was a gift and it was well received! The 3 discs are nice to have especially if you like all the extras. The extended version was much better than the original to me. Great gift for a great price.
3,OK ADAPTION TO THE CLASSIC COMIC ICON! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I am a huge Marvel comics fan from the 60's through 70's so, it is really disappointing for me to see such a great comic icon get such a mediocre movie. The FX's are fine but, the story is confusing and tedious. Cage and Co. are bland and don't appear too interested in what they're doing. It's not terrible but, it's not great by any stretch! Rent it don't buy it unless your a real die hard fan."
2,You'll like this if your 13,"Probably a great movie for adolescents, but most adults will be bored with the action and the story. It's always a pleasure to see Cage on the screen -- and even more of a pleasure to see the aging but loaded-with-character Sam Groom from time to time. Other than that, get ready to fast forward on the DVD player."
4,Not as bad as it could've been.,Being a long time fan of Ghost Rider I was very skeptic about this film. I've always enjoyed Nick Cage's movies but doubted him as Johnny Blaze. I still feel Ryan Reynolds would've been an ideal choice but that's just me. Mr. Cage pulls the character off albeit he just doesn't fit the role. I did enjoy the CGI and the storyline was much better then I expected. Overall I liked this film and would recommend to new and old fans alike.
2,Mostly crap....,"Okay, it wasn't the worst film ever, but there was nothing about it that I would call good. The acting and script were marginal. The script was about as predictable as it gets. The special effects seemed pretty low budget, and it had none of the feel fo the original comic book. This Ghost Rider seemed to have no edge to him, and the fight scenes were weak because of their low budget. Maybe its best trait was how forgettable it was. At least it left no scars."
3,A fun comics hero flick - More like 3 1/2 stars,"First of all, based on the original material - the graphic novel -, the film is actually executed very well. Fans of this genre won't be disappointed. Cage is cool as always and it was a delight to see Peter Fonda again, even though he's playing Satan. Also the modern-day ghost rider legend comes across well. As usual with Cage in the picture, there's a slight touch of Elvis in there. Technically, I don't think they could have done it any better, because the CGI effects are all in the right places and the ghost rider looks cool. Again, it's a fun comics hero flick with cheese nachos in one hand and a bucket of popcorn in the other ... and in a sense it's a thrill ride, but don't expect a super mega Hollywood movie blockbuster. Still, it's well worth watching it on a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon."
3,Hilarious Carnie Movie!,"Carnival workers (aka ""carnies"") finally get their due in this 2007 release loosely based upon the Marvel Comics anti-hero Ghost Rider (called ""the Rider"" through most of the picture). The extended cut gives us even more cheese than the theatrical release--almost two solid hours of bad dialogue and absurd plot twists.Nicolas Cage holds the movie together, though, but it's difficult not to laugh outloud when his head catches on fire. As a fan of the 1990s comic book incarnation, I was expecting a darker, more serious take on ol' flamehead. But then I realized that the character is a carnie with a flaming skull for a face. Oh well--it was worth a few laughs."
1,Nicholas Cage = Ham Rider,"Nicholas Cage is a bad actor. This movie isn't even a real testemant to that cause it is a bad movie. Cage has reached a level in his movies that can only be surpassed by the hammy Burt Reynolds when his career was going down the tubes. Cage hams it up in every scene doing his quirk/Elvis/hambone gimmick that is so over used and over done by him that it is like, ""why is he getting paid to do this?"" and ""why am I paying to see it?"" I am a comics fan and I read Ghost Rider. Cage is totally miscast. But I guess when you have a ton of money and you are 'over' as a 'star' you get to play any part you want. Peter Fonda is good as Mephisto and Eva Mendes is hot but this movie just sucks. Cage is horrible and the movie is not half as fun or entertaining as it could have been if a good writer and director had taken the reigns and fired hambone droopy face. Sam Elliot is good... as usual."
1,Slow and boring,Slow. The devil is almost ridiculous. No dramatic intensity at all. The action looks fake. The end is too easy.
2,not worth buying,"big waste of time, and i really did not understandwhat the heck was going,I was totally bored withinthe first 40 minutes of the picture."
2,Made for the under 12 boys market.,What a complete load of garbage this movie is. Honestly I have not seen such a pathetic movie since I unwittingly watched The Core.The technical side of this BD version are extremely good just a pity the story line is just so darn bad.
2,Shipping & handling too expensive!!!!,Item was delivered in condition described. Vendor was prompt and courteous. Probably would not hesitate to buy from this seller again due to overpriced shipping and handling charge.
1,A Brief History of John Valentine Kratz .......,"I ordered this book Dec 16, 2009. It was to be delivered between Dec 22 and Jan 8. It is now Jan 18 and I still don't have the book and the seller has not been very helpful."
3,A good general purpose planning map,"There are 2 1:40,000 maps which provide coverage equal to about 8 USGS Quads.At this scale the details are small, but perhaps sufficient for an overview and general orientation, as the main trails are well marked.The trail descriptions, lengths and overall vertical altitude gained/lost details are helpful for general planning of the treks and the general park info is useful."
5,HANDY DEVICE,Bought this product before going on vacation since I couldn't locate the original adapter for my camera (thanks to my 3yo's facination with cords). I love the smaller design and it charged quickly. It packs up in the camera bag nicely. I won't have to worry about where it went anymore.
5,Stop Charging Your Battery in the Camcorder!,"This charger is awesome! The battery snaps right in, and the entire thing plugs into the wall. An indicator light lets you know the status of the charge. You can be charging your second battery while continuing to use your camcorder. The best part is that it is so small, it easily fits in the bag with your camcorder."
4,Beware the Australian Outback!,"Razorback is a highly underrated and well made horror tale of a monsterous razorback hog terrorizing the Australian Outback. I have viewed this film several times, and it never gets tiresome for good fun! Unfortunately, this film is not distributed on DVD, much to my displeasure! Perhaps one day they will give this film its due rights and release it in digital format. For fans of horror film, I give Razorback 4 stars and highly recommend it!"
2,I really wanted to like this book...but I didn't.,"I was so excited to find this book by an author who is from and still lives in my home state of Kentucky. The excitement ended by chapter two. The romance portion of the story is frustrating and the mystery predictable. The two main characters get together in chapter 1 (yes, chapter 1) and they are in limbo until later in the book...much later. The ""mystery"" in the story is probably only a mystery if you don't own a tv or this is the first book you've ever picked up. Free time is precious, spend it on Charlaine Harris orLaurel K. Hamilton."
5,Don't miss the director's commentary!,"I will not share my impressions of this brilliant film, because so many other reviews have pointed out its excellence in regard to plot, cinematography, acting etc. and I agree completely. But I do want to urge everyone who watches it to watch it straight through and then go into the special features and set it up so you can watch it again with the director's commentary. This dvd is loaded with extras (including deleted scenes, none of which are outstanding or necessary) but I was most impressed with the honest heartfelt commentary by the writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck that I highly recommend everyone buy the film - even if you watched it on the big screen - just for this very reason. The Lives of Others is indeed one of the best films of the decade."
4,Stalking Stasi,"An searing depiction of what life was like for anyone daring to think differntly under the East German Communist dictatorship, and a classic example of why that regime, of all the Soviet Union's Eastern European satellites was the most hated."
5,One terrific movie,"One of the best I have seen lately. What a wonderful heartwarming movie, I will definitely watch this again. The movie focuses on who protects the targeted couple and the consequences."
5,The Future In America,Anyone who wonders what life will be like under President Hillary Clinton needs only to watch this film......
2,Exceedingly poor sub-titling on an excellent film,Shame on Sony--and Amazon for participating--in the distribution of a very fine German film where about 25% of the subtitles never come thru.
2,DVD Region Codes,I would like to take this opportunity to complain about the region codes of DVDs. I think that they are a major nuisance and just the consequence of the sort of greed that brought the global financial system so close to collapse. They serve no other purpose than squeezing a maximum of dollars out of the pockets of customers. Amazon as a major buyer might very well be in a position to do something effective against this nonsense. Would be great!
5,frsh perspective,"From time to time the academy likes to recognize those movies which have advanced cinema as an art form. The lives of others is clearly one of these movies. It plucks at your emotions like a harp. It's themes are discrete, but those who can really appreciate the film could tell you not only that it is about pre-wall Germany, but also about humanity in general (love, hate, trust, corruption, friendship, privacy, and jealousy), and how an individual can change despite the most unwelcoming and adverse circumstances to thier new desired path.This is a really beautiful film with so many meaningful subtleties whose genius could take your breath away. If you do watch it, be sure to watch out for ties- (not only the ones that are woven by relationships, but also those which hang from the neck's of the characters [who can tie them/wear them and what it means]. This is one of those brilliant movies which I believe only comes around every 20 years."
4,How it was on the other side,A movie you must see if you have read 1984 and are concerned about the direction our country is taking.A truly frightening picture.
2,Would like it more if it held the picks better...,Great ideal but when you grab a pick you get like 3 or 4 at a time. I must have fat fingers...you may have better luck.
2,Cheap Material,This holder is of very cheap quality.. I would recommend spend some more $$ and get a decent pick holder.Not recommended.
2,Broke in one day,"What a pain, do you return a $3.50 item even though it's free with Amazon's great service? Seems like not the green thing to do. Complaints, the back and spring broke off, probably trying to insert more picks that it can hold. Everyone sells picks by the dozen, was hoping this would hold the dozen, but only holds 5-6."
3,Missing Item,"I received this product on time, unfortunately I did not receive the bag of 24 guitar picks I ordered along with this holder."
5,Sleek pickholder,"Can hold about 8 0.73 mm picks at once. 10 if you really cram them in. As long as your pick has some sort of grip to it and isn't totally smooth, you should have no problem quickly sliding one out with your finger. I might go for slighter thicker picks in the future, but that has nothing to do with the holder I suppose..."
3,It's worth $2.00...but not much more,"So, this pickholder arrived today. It is smaller than I expected and is not as sturdy and nice looking as the picture showed. I can fit my Planet Waves medium picks in it. But, I can only fit 7, they come in packs of 10. It has an adhesive sticker on the back so that you can stick it to something to keep it in place while you insert and remove picks. That is all fine and good, but, I don't plan to stick it to anything. When it is not stuck to something it takes some skill, or two hands to grab a new pick out. So, if you loose one mid-song, you probably won't be able to quickly grab another. But, it was only $2, so it fits what I paid for it, and it will help me keep 7 of my 10 picks from spilling out everywhere."
5,Great Gift!,I purchased this for two of my grown-up musical children at Christmas this year. The reaction from them was lots of happiness. I packed them in two different packages with other things and initially my daughter thought there was only one and she was quick to speak for it. Too funny!Such a little thing. Such a great reaction. Gotta love it!
4,Does the job so far.,Nice little device. We'll see how long it lasts (a cheap little plastic thing really) but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue. I use it with the medium dunlop picks. Glad I got it.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"I ordered this pick holder because I always misplace my picks, I personally put this pick holder on the head of my guitar and I haven't lost a pick since! I highly recommend this product!"
1,Must have done something wrong...,I might have done something wrong...I read in a review that these hold six picks.It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...I'll just keep using my pockets.
4,Nostalgic purchase,I used to love this show. The episodes are still funny to me and it has been a great blast from the past to watch.
4,"Used often, sparks imagination and creativity","Of the LPS playsets my daughter owns, this one gets the most use. She likes that it has various spots into which she can place multiple figures, so it feels more like a ""home"" for the animals. The moving baskets at the top are usually reserved for the more important figures, but my daughter takes the time to allow each animal a turn. This is what makes this playset worthwhile -- she actually uses it for extended periods and it prompts her to come up with scenarios for her animals. There are very few things that can get lost, except that the baskets sometimes come off, requiring adult intervention."
2,It broke twice!,"I bought this as an addition to a fast-growing LPS collection. We cranked the handle and the gondola went around once and it never worked again. So I returned it and got another set. This time, the gondolas never did go around. Maybe we just have incredibly bad luck. Now we are waiting for a new set from Hasbro."
4,Fun Pet Shop toy,"My six-year-old Littlest Pet Shop collector loves this toy she received for Christmas today! Before she had this she had setup her own town using the pet nooks and other accessories, so she is thrilled to have a place to use the nooks. She enjoys playing with the baskets that help them travel around, the elevator and stairs."
4,Hairdresser to the Stars: A Hollywood Memoir,"Oprah, where are you?! This book is amazing. Blymyer takes you along on her adventures here there and everywhere with the most exciting people you've heard and read about. Not only is she generous in sharing the fun times, but she also shares the most personal turns in her life where she questions what is this all about? She questions her decisions regarding her husband, children and her career and all the while she is searching for a deeper meaning to her life. You'll laugh and cry and feel a little sadness when the book ends and Blymyer has to say goodbye to the reader. You will go back to read this book time and time again and pass it along to your friends. Enjoy!"
4,Fan noise,"Other reviews aren't kidding about the loud fan. Do not plan to use this in a typical home or office area. Fan noise is too loud to concentrate, much more than background ""white noise"". Otherwise, no complaints."
1,Horrible sounding remaster,"The remastered sound on this UMG Deluxe Edition is so bad that it actually hurts to listen to it.Massively compressed. Grating, shrill top end. No bottom. Compared to wonderful job on ""Exile""this is sad. Threw it in the garbage."
5,Better than 5 stars,Wow! I am playing the 10 bonus track CD more than the original these days!!! You simply have to buy the deluxe version of this great album. I am blown away by the 2nd disc. The songs are hugely enjoyable and reveal more every time you play it. This could easily have been another double album when it cam out in 1978. Fantastic stuff. Don't buy the standard recording. Spend a little more and get this version of the album. You won't be disappointed.
3,Some Girls,"Once again ""the abkco/Virgin music releases cheat the Americans!On this Virgin CD, Virgin/abkco, left us only the 'short' American song titles. Most of the original tracks are on 12"" 45rpm vinyl, usually 6-8 minutes duration. All we get here in the States is the leftover 2-3 minute 'for U.S. consumption only tracks. The Europeans have access to the full-length versions.Try ""Harlem Shuffle"", it was a 2-3 minute 45rpm, for U.S. consumption. It is also a 12"" 45rpm vinyl, and on CD at 8:15 min. We are being cheated by track elimination-marketing.apa"
3,It was ok,"This is an alright album but its not really one of my favorites. Miss You is a pretty good song even though its disco and When the Whip Comes Down,Respectable, and Shattered are also all pretty good, not anything great like on Exile but still ok.Just My Imagination gets on my nerves, I dont know why its just kind of dull.Lies is forgettable and Beast of Burden is annoying and sounds like the beegees or some other horrible disco group. Before They Make Me Run is probaly the best song on the album.The worst one is Far Away Eyes which is one of the most idiotic songs the Stones have ever done. It probaly wouldnt have been quite so bad if they would have done it straight instead of Jagger doing an awful hillbilly impersonation. The song Some Girls is full of stereotypes about women and its not really that great of a song. Its an ok album all in all but if your new to the Stones I suggest you get Exile on Main Street or let it Bleed first."
4,The Bad Boys Battle Back,"Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tale end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era"" of the Stone Age. While this CD has a fistful of ""greatest hits"" from this period some of the songs are distinctly anti-women, intentionally or not, at least the lyrics would not then, and do not today, stand the test for ""political correctness"". That includes ""Some Girls"" and ""Beast Of Burden"" ( a little). Nevertheless this stuff holds up pretty well, especially ""The Girl With Far Away Eye""."
3,Another Trick of Mick Jaggger,"In my Opinion as a Rolling Stones fan Since i was 10 years, this Edition doesen't worth because is expensive and the bonus cd is almost good, the case is simple without extra photos and should be like a mini lp edition...so the next time i'll think twice before buy "" A Deluxe Edition"""
1,"Title should be: ""What you already know, documented here""","I have bought and enjoyed many books on Amazon and this is the first one that has compelled me to write a review. Unless you were born on Mars or grew up in a place devoid of an economic system, this book is utterly useless.The advise contained in it, such as ""Look up the phone number yourself and save on directory assistance charges."" or ""Don't waste money on lottery tickets, or cut back on the amount you buy."" or my personal favorite: ""if you need to send a complaint letter make sure you include the details of what transpired."" Is anyone out there really going to send a complaint letter and simply say, ""I complain,"" without putting in the details of what you are complaining about?I've never returned anything to Amazon but this will surely be the first time I try. THIS BOOK IS NOT AS ADVERTISED! The advise given in this book is so utterly elementary that I cannot even fathom an audience with a perceptable IQ that would find value in it."
2,An observation,"Having worked on Wall Street for 25 years, by and from experience I can assert that ANY economic behavior by any human does entail a marginal error toward/from the misinterpreted phrase ""zero sum game.Simply research historic Federal Reserve monetary policy to understand this, let alone structured finance!Prof. Thurow's point is that the US political economy, its citizens, and those ""elites"" who make its policy are asymetrically informed. Sooner or later, the US has to restructure its misapplication of redistributing wealth; hence the shock of the 70's, the long-term mess Regan has left; the stock bubble of the mid-90's; the current housing bubble. Another shock a la 1973 and 1978 might redirect this country's ""elites'"" thinking towards more long-term pragmatic lines."
5,Calling all Baby Boomers!,"If you grew up in the 50's this book will seem like it was written for you! Even if you are not a Boomer, you will see the wry humor. It is a book to share with a friend and a book to keep for yourself when you need to laugh. Ann Taintor is great!"
4,Well written series,I ordered this book of the series because it was a continuation of the first two. I admire the research the author had done to make this series so interesting. My wife was bedridden and I bought them to read to her and she enjoyed them as well. Having lived a life of a variety of experiences I can spot areas where the author may have erred in describing things but this appears to be very factual and well reseached. My wife's grandfather came from this area of Norway to Minnesota in the same time period which made it even more captivating.
4,"Mind opening, thought provoking!",Alan Watts has a amazing talent of explaining the complex in a way that is entertaining and easy to follow.
3,Punk rock,"He's amazing.But the 2nd disc is not. For some reason the second disc is all a punk band called attack, attack! Not very zen. I wrote to amazon to request an exchange - but no reply."
5,Keeps the cold air out when i ride my motorcycle,"I have a 2011 yamaha fz6r. I bought some thicker motorcycle gloves to help fight the cold air when i ride especially on the free way (I travel 36 miles one way). But the thicker gloves only lasted 10 minutes and once my hands got cold, it hurt really bad, i still had maybe another 30 minutes worth of riding. But once i bought these puppies and installed them without any kind of modifications i can ride in 27 degree weather with only regular thin gloves. Dont get me wrong, they were a bit chilly but they were not painfully freezing. They do cover the controls so know where your buttons are. Also its a bit of a hassel moving in and out of these so once i got my hands in i left then there. I do recommend them for anybody who rides in the cold weather and i have not had any problems with them at all."
1,Mickey is hardly on his own DVD!,"It's like Disney doesn't care about their hero, Mickey Mouse. I mean, shouldn't a Mickey video really be about MICKEY? Donald Duck, Goofy, And Pluto are really the stars in the cartoons that the Disney Studio picked for this DVD. Mickey almost gets nothing to do!!""Mickey's Circus"" is mostly about Donald.""Hawaiian Holiday"" is mostly about Goofy and Pluto and Mickey only appears for a few Moments!""Moving Day"" is mostly about Goofy.""Orphan's Picnic,"" is mostly about Donald.Mickey is the star in the other three cartoons but that's still not good, he's the star for less than half of his own DVD!!One of my friends has the Walt Disney Treasure Mickey DVD and it has lots and lots of cartoons where Mickey is really the star. Why aren't some of those on This DVD, is what I want to know?"
5,My 3 year old grandson LOVED this!,This Classic Mickey Mouse produce was my grandson's favorite stocking stuffer! Contains many old Mickey Mouse cartoons! He sat and watched it over and over again.
2,TOTAL F#*&%NG GARBAGE,THIS IS BY FAR ALICE COOPERS WORST ALBUM TO DATE. GIVE IT A RESTAND STICK TO GOLFING. HIS BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM. STAY CLEAR.
5,The biggest diamond,"Alice is the master and ""Dirty Diamonds"" is ""Perfect"".I prefer ""Woman of mass distraction"",""Pretty ballerina"",""Steal that car"",""You make me wanna"".Perfect songs for the best rocker in the world.I know Alice since 1974 and this is one of your best albuns.BUY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,decent but less than the two before it.,"The two before this one really were excellent, this one is more average cooper to me. It's good though in most of the songs but none really tear into it as solidly as the dragontown, last temptation, hey stoopid, or 'brutal planet' did. So while I like most of the songs here, I must say that this is stripped down and less punchy than I would have liked. It's still not a bad cd though, and it's better than 'dada' etc. Still I think the ultra hard brutal planet was the way alice needed to stay musically. this is more like a salute to the old days which is cool, and I like it! But there's no great standouts on this one like on all the above I listed."
5,Alice Is Aging Well Compared To The Rest Out There...,"Alice Cooper continues to amaze. The man just keeps bringing them every year and still sounds great. I really love this album because it's more like the classic Alice I grew up with. I've been a fan since the Halloween special of '76 and continue to no matter what Alice puts out, but I gotta say I really like the 2005 Alice and hope he never stops. Get your copy today and don't waste your money on all the recycled stuff of the old groups there putting out now adays. Get yourself some new music and some Classick Alice Cooper. Rock On!"
5,Great toy for children of all abilities,"My son has a visual impairment as well as other disabilites. He LOVES this toy. He is almost 4, and has loved this toy since his first birthday. He loves all of the things that it can do. He especially likes exploring the textures of the cloths."
4,good but i wish it were more stable,my son loves this toy. the only problem i had with this toy is that it is not stable. i had to tie it my coffee table so that it won't topple over when my son tries to pull himself up.
1,Party tyyme karaoke,"The karaoke cd was to be used for a performance at an elementary school, but we couldn't use it because there was too long of a wait time before the music began."
1,hideous unreadable dreck,how did heppner publish this mess of ideas and words? unreadable. possibly the worst book i have ever read. ever. ick.
1,Westinghouse 3 Channel Wireless Intercom - WHI-3C,When I received the intercom I was excited! Then I read and followed the directions for turning the unit on. The only sound that came from the contraption was a loud and ominous screeching. I tried several different ways to get the unit to work without success. This product was a real dissapointment. I mailed it back for a complete refund. Please don't buy!
1,DOA,One of the units had the IN USE light on all the time and emitted a continuous tone. It was almost like a button was stuck or something. Returned it for a refund.
3,Not quite as advertised,A well designed and functional item and certainly priced right.The problem: In a quiet environment such as a bedroom the background hum is simply unacceptable. I've tried different channels and both sides of the circuit breaker box without success to reduce background noise.Need it for break-room or kitchen and you won't be disappointed; elsewise it will keep you awake at night.
1,False advertising and labeling!,"This device is not wireless. It does not work by radio transmission. It works by trying to run on your home's electrical circuits. The last time I checked electricity ran over WIRES and not through the air.Somebody should force the people who make these devices and call them wireless to take them off the market or not be allowed to label them as ""Wireless"". And not just this manufacturer but all of them."
5,Fascinating Corporate Bio,"Books and articles about the demise or bankruptcy of yet another airline are not uncommon, but how often do you find a good read about a thriving airline? JetBlue, the brainchild of David Neeleman, has beaten the odds by surviving, thriving and becoming successful beyond anyone's imagination, except maybe Neeleman's. JetBlue reached $1 billion a year in sales in 2004, is consistently profitable while the major airlines are losing billions and has developed a devout following. Author Barbara S. Peterson began reporting on JetBlue before it launched its first plane. She documents its progress from conception and birth to early development. She obviously ""drank the blue Kool-Aid,"" an insider's allusion to JetBlue loyalty, and couches even the negative in soft terms. However, we welcome the fascinating story she tells. Curious readers will be intrigued to find out how JetBlue elevated customer service to an art form while keeping its planes running on time."
2,Small hands beware,"I always check Amazon reviews before I buy a product and have found them generally accurate. So why did I not listen to the several reviewers who said that arthritic or small handed people should avoid this press? COOKS magazine got me, plus all the 5 star reviews. BUT PLEASE LISTEN UP if you are afflicted with either condition. I could not get any garlic out of this press. The OXO leaves residue but is much easier to squeeze. Should have stuck with what I had.Mickey Dachs"
3,Jumbo?? Not so much.,"This garlic press works fine on two small cloves or one large clove at a time. Don't read the other reviews and just think it's people with small or weak hands. It is ridiculously difficult to press more than one or two cloves at a time, even using two hands. So ignore the word ""jumbo"", and just appreciate that it's parts are all metal and that the cleaner fits in it so nicely. It's not so bad to press cloves one after the other, it's just not the item I thought I was getting!"
2,"Good press, but it broke","I had the smaller version of this press for years, and it worked fine and remained together all that time. Less than a year ago, I thought it would be nice to get the larger size. This press worked just like the small version, and I was happy with it until it broke in two. The pin that holds the two pieces together came out, and it is impossible to fix without drilling a hole all the way through the two pieces and inserting a different pin.I hope I can locate my old press......."
1,Broken after 5 months (about 40 uses),"We got this press in September, and enjoyed it until it broke. It seemed capable of handling multiple cloves with the skin on, and was quite easy to clean, even without using the cleaning tool. But today, the grated part of the press broke cleanly off from the rest of the press, after having cracked about halfway off two days ago. We would not recommend anyone buying this press unless you like getting a new one every few months!"
1,"Soft coating scrapes off easily, could be a health hazard.","I'm not sure what happened but this specific zyliss has a really soft coating on it. It scrapes very easily. Check out my video on youtube. Until they fix the coating issue, this gets a 1 star from me."
4,Garlic Lover,"It works as described. No peeling of garlic, hooray!! And the cleaning is very simple.However, if you put in more than 3 cloves, you will need some serious hand strength to squeeze the handles. It's just something you might keep in mind if you're considering this to give as a gift."
1,Complete waste of money!,"I am an able-bodied cook with decently strong hands. I have been using garlic presses for 14 years. I couldn't get a single piece of garlic, peeled or unpeeled to mince through this thing. I asked my husband, with stronger hands, to give it a try and he was able to make it happen with considerable force. After a week of frustration and sore hands, I gave it to my five-year-old son to have. He would probably rate it at three or four stars because he thinks it is a great toy and it does a superb job of shooting play-doh through the holes. In my experience, when buying a garlic press you should buy one that has prongs that grasp the garlic while pushing it through the holes. In my opinion, this is definitely not a good garlic press. The best garlic press I have ever owned was from Ikea. It finally just broke and I miss it dearly. It's almost worth driving four hours to get another!"
1,VERY loosely,"Wikipedia: 'the series is loosely based on Belgian writer Hermann Huppen's comic book series'.Deze irritante tv-serie heeft helemaal geen overeenkomst met de stripreeks van Hermann. En ik begrijp ook niet waarom Hermann zijn fiat heeft gegeven om zijn naam daaraan te verbinden.Weer zo een typische invulling van de Amerikaanse zwart/wit gedachte.Kurdy is vooral een blanke klootzak in de stripreeks en dat wordt dan ingevuld door dat Cosby-watje... En dan Jeramiah, ongelofelijk. Een of andere soap 1234 figuur. Wat een foute typecasting!Breng dit aub NIET uit in Europa."
1,Season 2 only on DVD,"Huge scam here. I watched the entire first season as purchased content and tonight found out the Amazon does not have season 2 available. Seriously? They will sell me a DVD. What a bunch of crap. I was pretty well sold on Amazon as my choice for streaming moveies through my television but now they want to rip me off into to buying the DVD of the second season. Amazon, get lost!!"
5,Madagascar: The Complete Collection,"A friend of mine was incredulous when he found out that I had not seen Madagascar, therefore I thought I had better see what all the fuss was about. I ordered the complete set and a separate Bluray of Madagascar III. They are great entertainment and you have to see them more than once to catch all of the funny things the animals say. I'm glad I can now say that I have seen Madagascar."
5,My kids love it!,I am so glad I purchased this set. My kids love Madagascar! As well as the rest of the family.
3,Good collection but Penguin movie is broken,"My daughters love the Madagascar movies and watch them at least once a day. However, they wanted to watch the Penguin movie as well, and when I put it in only short episodes (10 sec or less) are showing. Very annoying when you expect to get a third, however short, movie in the collection. I've tried to contact the seller to address the issue but there is no where on the order where this can be done. Disappointed for sure :("
3,good book but hard to follow,I was required to read this book for an English class for a Literary research paper and I thought that this book was great but the transitions from past to present were not handled well and I would often have to go and re-read the text again to help comprehend the situation.
3,Complex issues presented masterfully by Baldwin,"I read this book as part of an English ""Out of Class"" reading assignment. I must say that if you are looking for a light hearted book- this is not it. It is filled with intense themes of racial relations, family relationships (esp. Father-Son), hypocrisy, and the like. I found the style of using flashbacks somewhat annoying at times, and consequently the plot was confusing in places. If you desire intense issues to be presented in a reasonably entertaining fashion, then this is the book for you, but beware if you desire a book of easy reading. Baldwin's skill in handling complex situations is quite noticable and makes the whole experience worthwhile."
1,Hated it!,I was really looking forward to reading this. The deeper I got the more repugnant was the religiosity to me. I sent it back to the library and got another book. I was turned off by the fundamtalist's belief system. Which is the base for this and something that I find completely wrong headed and evil. Misses the whole point of Jesus' ministry.
4,Past Meets Present,I felt such a connection in reading this book. All the sayings and the scripture quotings reminded me so much of my childhood and growing up in church and of my elder family members. I felt at one with John's experience. I could totally relate. I am in awe of Baldwin's writing. The metaphores and symbolisms were well placed. Some of the scene transitions could have been a little more seamless. I found myself a couple of times back tracking to understand if I was in the past or present. Character development was to a T. This was a great read!
1,i dont recommend this one,the author probably was taking some kind of cheap drugs or eating wrong mashrooms when he wrote this. there is nothing useful here and it all just doesnt make any sense
4,Olympic Heaven,"I liked this game because It has loads of events, with diffent levels of controls. The controls take time to get use to but once you get into it, you end up spending ages trying to beat your own world record. The shooting and the archery are the best events."
1,A disappointment,"If you seek characters and a story with fidelity to the Doyle canon, look elsewhere. Holmes here is dim and vulgar, missing many obvious clues up to the end. His conversations with Watson feature a late twentieth century emotional intimacy wholly foreign to the Victorian era.The plot is lurid and overly extended by improbable characters and happenings, including Holmes' remarkably consistent incompetence."
1,Not scary,"Nothing new or horrific here. I don't understand why the dead communicated with the family in such a violent, disturbing manner; even when they were just trying to help."
2,Not bad but...,"Even if you didn't know this was a Pang Brothers effort, you'd know it a mile off, as I did having missed the opening credits at the cinema.The Brothers Pang borrow liberally from their past work, notably The Eye - an outstanding film if ever I saw one - and the shame of it is that what was used to such intense effect previously is squandered on this film. The motifs have now become routine and formulaic. For a first effort it's not bad but the wet-blanket happy-ever-after ending lets it all down. I'd much rather no-one-here-gets-out-alive and have the birds peck the family's eyes out, starting with the wretched little rugrat that takes up way too much screen time.The cast generally give it their best shot but William B. Davis is wasted in a completely redundant role.If you want to see something shocking, suspenseful to the point of nerve-wracking, watch The Eye on a double-bill with The Birds and you have yourself a truly sleepless night.There's nothing new here at all."
2,What if...,"you had enough money to hire Dylan McDerrmott, but then, not enough to pay for the scriptwriters or special effects? You might come up with a third rate film like, say, The Messengers. What was it about, you ask? Well, crows. Spooky crows. Spooky crows that attack people, like, say, in a movie made some time back by a guy who did pay for decent scripts. And, ghosts. Creepy ghosts. Creepy ghosts with long dark hair that skitter along the ceilings, like, say, in a movie a few years back that had a really good script, based on another movie from Japan with a really good script. And a farm hand who turns out to be a homocidal maniac instead of the cheerful, helpful guy he seems to be, like...oh, never mind. Save your money, watch The Ring or The Birds or pretty much ANYTHING else. Avoid if at all possible. I am over the age of 13."
2,Creepy visuals but bland story,"I was disappointed with this flick. I love Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert movies so I expected this one to be good. The cast was good and the cinematography was really good. There are a lot of cool things to look at, but there was nothing new in the story at all."
3,HMM...,I thought it was interesting movie but It isn't. It was bored.This movie was contained not very scary and not very fun. The story was a little short.
3,They're not exactly messengers,"They have no particular message to send. They're ghosts that are not very happy and had a bad death. The living family that moves in is stuck with them. Worth watching for the actors, if not the story so much."
3,"Hate steam, love the game!",I love half-life 2! It's a great game with lots of surprises! My #1 complaint is not the game at all but Steam. It has to run with Steam which is absolutely annoying. It took Steam approx. a full hour to load everything. I have a 5-gig limit on my air card and it has taken almost all of my 5-gigs. I would give this 5 stars if it was without steam. I can't stress the aggravation of steam enough.
4,"not too shabby, definitely a good deal","team fortress 2 gets boring after a bit, but they just released two new maps, so it should add some freshness to the game, portal is an amazing, clever, game, very trippy when you first start playing, have yet to play any of the half life games, although i am definitely looking forward to it5 games for the price of 1 = awesome"
1,Fun if you ever get to play it,"I bought the Orange Box three days ago. For some reason, the games are trying to download themselves from Steam rather than installing off of the DVD's. So far, only the original Half Life has installed. This is after leaving my computer running nonstop for two whole days. Occasionally, the install craps out with ""The Steam Servers are too busy. Try again in a few minutes"" and I start the install again.If the games aren't finished installing by tomorrow (72 hours after purchase) I am sending this back for a refund."
1,Steam Really Messed this one up,"Steam used to be an optional install for your computer now that you are forced to install it before you can install this game. I have had a pretty little orange box sitting on my shelf for a week. If you use AOL as an ISP, I would recommend not purchasing this game until they come out with a fix for this, because you can not download the steam update while using AOL therefore the whole game is useless and unable to be installed until this is fixed. The orange box has become a pretty expensive BOOKEND for me. THANKS STEAM!"
1,What a nightmare,"Got it out of the box when I got home, excited about playing Portal. Plugged it in, I get nothing but an account prompt. Okay, that's fine, I had a Steam account years ago. Type in my username and password. Okay, doesn't work, that's weird. Okay, so I do the password retrieval. Hours go by. Nothing in my e-mail. I try to create a new account. I'm sorry, your e-mail is already being used! Your account name is already taken!Frustrating, no fun to be had here, waste of time. No support number to call, no way to get to a human being. Horrible support, horrible installation, horrible product to purchase."
1,The worst installation ever...,"I put one star for a simple reason... i cant play any of the games right now ... the steam is ""updating team fortres"" come on !! the program is download the complete game. 2 DVD for a 40MB Steam installer? it is a joke... why dont they put the f*** games in the DVD? i payed for a game, not for a downloader. Its more easy to put the shop only online and pay for the downloads, but if i buy the ""box"" I asume I will get the complete games... and the single player of Half life? why dont they say that we need to download too? At leats put an advice in the box: ""Only for download the games"" and stop to cheat the buyers. The games are good stuff, but Valve and Steam have just one start."
1,Gargabe game from garbage company,"I will never buy a valve product again. I bought a legit game from a legit source, and valve just cancelled my account for no reason. They have done this to what I suspect is in the thousands of customers. There is a forum site where many people are screaming mad.I played the various Orange box games for 1 week, than they basically screwed me over by deactivating a legit account.If you wanna play a game sold by a crooked company, buy this game."
5,One of the Greatest gaming deals around.,"I have to say that this is one of the best gaming deals that i have ever seen. Five games for 30 dollars?! Now i already had half-life 2, and episode 1, but Valve gives you the ability to gift those to a friend. Portal is really fun but a little on the short side but Tf2 is the best game out of the Orange box. Its unique looks seems like your playing a comic book and the different classes keep the game interesting. Valve continues to update the game as well releasing new weapons, achievements, game modes, and several new maps."
5,One of the best deals around!,"This is a bargain at the MSRP. If you can find it on sale, it's a steal. If you're new to Halflife 2, this is the collection to get.Some of the best single player and multiplayer FPS action, and Portal is a great puzzle game.A no-brainer!"
3,"Good DVD & VHS Recording, Bad DV In & Service Response","I have been using GoVideo VR 3845 for the last four months recoding to both DVD and VHS just great. Started using DV-In connection to my Sony Camcorder worked OK the first time. Second time ""Not connected message"". I call GoVideo service and they suggested replacing new used-once cable. The camera side indicated `DV connection', must be the GoVideo problem. Called again wait 10 minutes and hung-up on. Call third time again message ""no customer support today"" (Monday 1/9/2006). I wrote an email to customer support with NO RESPONSE (except the automated received notice). THANK YOU Costco for cash back return (keep your receipt and box it came in). For just this single reason alone of non-service, do not buy GoVideo products!"
2,Pads! uck!,The pads stick to bottom of moving thingy and work for 1 or 2 times and then make a mess.
5,excellent,This products gives your skin the smooth finish look. I would recommend this product to any one who desires this look to their face.
4,For The Price? Great,"Great for the price but I did have some problems. The pads provided, if they got too wet, would move around as I used them on my face. It is very easy to wet them too much and you end up with a lathery extravaganza. I can't say if it's better than just using a towel but it does make washing my face more 'fun'.But those are small problems. It works as advertised. No one can buy this and feel ripped off. There is something very pleasant about that!"
4,Good Cleansor,"I like this wand. It works pretty well with the pillows you buy separately. I use it in the shower. After dropping it many times, it seems to be indestructible. Afterwards, my skin feels really clean."
4,Works well but you have to buy refills,I would recommend this product BUT you go through the soap-filled scrubbers quickly. They're really only good once so you're talking about a new pack a week. Leaves skin very clean and soft though
1,terrible page quality,"The book looks fine on the outside by when you open it, pages start coming loose very easily. Thankfully i havent found any missing pages yet. Very unsatisfied with the quality"
3,Not entirely accurate,"In my opinion, Ms. Drakulic did exaggerate some things related to Yugoslavia (now abstract and gone). I guess this was done for the sake of keeping readers animated and interested in finishing the book. I do agree with the reader from Slovenia, as I was also born in the former Yugoslavia. Yes, we did occasionally have shortage of some items in the 80's, but not to the extent it was presented in this book. Not even close to her book ""Cafe Europa"", in terms of being informative about the Eastern Block (Warsaw Pact) countries, which by the way, Yugoslavia was never part of. This book will make readers, unfamiliar with the Eastern Europe, think just that."
3,REViEW!,"This book is amazing, and the author is an amzing drawer. But it is a little hard to follow for us slow learners, haha. But once you practice it surley will help you a ton. Also check out Draw Real People!"
3,...................,"Everyone leaves reviews about how much sucess they have in making things look ""so real"".... I've practiced and practiced and practiced. I still to this day after about 10 months of drawing after using this book, CANNOT figure out the lighting technique! Whenever I try using it, (which was only 2 times and I gave up) it comes out looking like a shady mess. But then I look at Lee Hammond's drawings, and her's are so flawless compared to mine. It makes me wonder if only true artists can do the lighting... (If anyone can say yes or no, please tell me. It seems like all artists can do the lighting....) I don't mean sound like a pity seeker, but it's the truth: My drawings aren't at all as good as Lee Hammond's!"
5,Finally!,"Undoubtedly one of the most popular cartoons of the 90s, this classic is finally making its way to DVD. Whether you are reliving your childhood or introducing this series to new kids, its sure to become a classic revisited or a new classic for some.The show featured a Hollywood cast, great stories, music and animation. A must have for all nostalgic cartoon fans or for those looking to find a quality well told animated series on DVD."
5,SG please come back,"I remember this album back in 1993 i heard this album from my girlfriend's brother and i was very impressed with this project. I kept the tape for a long time because i was not a SG fan or anything but i do like good r&b music. Now the songs on here that i like was produced by steven rusell of troop and the opening cut (i still care) is a jam and then the slow ballad's were the cuts (butterflies),(you run away) is my 2nd best slow jam of all-time behind (can you stand the rain) and that alone made this album very special. And then the song (you can tie me down) is also a big hit and it's a shame that this group didn't get a chance to follow up to this release and this is the only group i have heard that all the members can really sing on their own even better than boyz to men. This is a very underrated group and much props to steven russell for the production on this album and gerald levert. peace"
4,Interesting and fun.,"Clearing up errors and enhancing the details of the deaths of the famous and infamous, this book is a surprisingly interesting and fun read. At times it can be gruesome but it is always entertaining and informative, such as the man who drank so much his bladder burst! Enjoy."
4,Good for the price,"It's too bad it didn't come out for the holidays because it would have made a great grab-bag gift. For $10, you only get 8 cartoons, but for someone like myself who is a Donald Duck fan, it's nice to watch this whenever I need a good laugh. Today's cartoons are much too violent. It's nice to see something clean."
4,Working together all by ourselves,"The myth, a myth that I had been taught and which continues to be the popular belief, of all America working together during the big war is certainly exploded in Brinkley's tome. Brinkley's insight explains why some black folks still do not like white folks...not that I blame them. If I were African American, I would not like me either. America apparently did not like women much either, although they were better tolerated than racial minorities. Our local book club could not find any glaring factual errors, anyhow. Reading how each interest often worked for itself and against other interests makes me wonder how we managed to win the war after all. Brinkley's book is a bit slow going, but it is a detailed resource which should be read by students of U.S. history as well as the general public."
5,Four Years Was Worth The Wait!!!!,"It's been 4 years since ""Land Of The Living"" blazed onto the club scene. With ""Stronger"", Kristine W returns in a spectacular manner. In a transition to popular radio, Kristine W accomplishes a very difficult task: staying true to her club roots and taking them mainstream.Kristine W does not only deliver -- she eclipses! Her beautiful ballads like ""Shower The People"" and ""Waters Run Deep"" put her beautiful, passionate voice on full display. And with her upbeat dance tracks like ""Stronger"", ""Stand In Love"", ""Let Love Reign"" and ""If Only You Knew"", Kristine proves again that she is the reigning Diva of Dance!This album is a destined classic and one that you're sure to enjoy!"
1,really confusing,"the book is very confusing, the author jumps around without any coherent orderelectronics is learned by cumulative knowledge , builing knowledge on top of base knowledge/principles, and more knowledge on top of thatbut the way this book goes, you have to learn it all separately, and then waste your time trying to put it all together into a coherent wholeproblems are useless too"
5,It is one of the books that enjoyed teaching it.,The fifth edition is moor complit than the pravious editions. I have thougt this book and the preavious editions for ten years and I never get tierd of it. I have translated the 5th edition to persion language. The autor has done a nice job.
3,Princess Steals the Show,"The real star of this show is Princess. Each time my family watches this film, we all wait for Princess to jump through the croc's mouth. Glad to see she doesn't become a Crock snack!"
3,More of the same,"I understand that the online component to this game is a large part of what makes it so well-received. For the vast majority of us who are stuck with single-player only, this game is good, but not distinguished.Gameplay remains virtually unchanged from Ratchet 2, except that a number of features of Ratchet 2 (and Ratchet 1) have been dropped, not the least of which is the grind boots and skateboarding levels. While the games have always been linear, this one takes it to an extreme; few levels have the branching pathways that were de rigueur for the predecessors.In the game's defense, it still is a heck of a lot of fun. And the voice acting/humor level is pretty good for a video game. But for a player not taking advantage of the online elements, its Greatest Hits predecessors will give you a lot more bang for the buck (assuming you haven't completed them already)."
4,On line Problem!,It is good for multiplayer cuz im a multiplayin guy but there was a prob in my online multiplay. 4/5 dudes
1,Disk has no scratches but doesn't play.,The disk is very clean and has no scratches but there appears to be some sunlight damage or laser damage to the disc so it wont even start up. I am very disappointed with this company for not trying the game before sending it out. On a higher note i had a second game come from this company that is clean and scratch-less but unlike ratchet and clank plays like its brand new.
4,Ratchet and Clank 3: Up your arsenal,This game is when ratchet fells left out. Clank is in a tv show and ratchets the butler.*Online mode*Multi mode*Travle with Quark*New Guns*New Upgrades
3,bitter end,"The alarm clock rings and Winnie awakes. It is the beginning of a new day. The scene is a flat landscape with Winnie in the centre. She is embedded up over her waist in the mound. Winnie is happy about every single day. Willie, her husband, lies behind her and he seldom speaks. He is reading the newspaper. Winnie is preoccupied with oneself, putting thinks out of her bag and talking to Willie.In the second act Winnie is embedded up to the neck in the mound. Her speech is an endless flow of words. She is more melancholy as in the first act. I think Beckett wanted to show the process of getting old and cope with it. They both are two different characters, but they complete in a very special way. Remembering the past and being happy with the present is one of the pleasures of life. Happy days will end, but if not today, it will be another precious day."
3,I've had better cookies!,"I bought the book because of the mouth-watering looking ribbon cookies on the cover, so that was the first recipe I tried when I got my copy.I was disappointed, first of all because the dough wasn't easy to handle at all, and the end result was a bland tasting cookie, a little dry even. I tried the spritz cookies as well and wasn't thrilled with those either.It is a great looking book, full of wonderful pictures, but the results don't live up to the presentation in my opinion. I'll stick to Nick Malgieri from now on!"
3,Helpful and confusing at the same time,Easy to understand when it comes to some topics and confusing on others. Only got this for class and ended up not much compare to what you can find on the web.
3,"Good story, but gets a bit long","I enjoy Jacqueline Carey, and this book and Banewrecker were the first two I'd read away from the Kusheil Series. While Banewrecker is quick moving and catching, Godslayer gets bogged down in the telling of the story. There is a great deal of wandering in either the desert or forests - or long, dark tunnels, depending on the characters. The book seemed cumbersome at times, and I found myself skimming over large sections to get to the meatier parts. This book is not as slick as her Kusheil stories. The main characters are well developed and Carey does a good job of letting her readers know their thoughts and feelings. Carey is a good writer who can tell a great story, however my feeling was that Godslayer does not live up to her other works."
3,Tex Ritter Rides Again on DVD!,"This review refers to the Critics Choice DVD named Tex Ritter Triple Feature #4.The movies in this DVD are:Song of the Gringo, 1936, 62 minTex Ritter rides with the Boy Scouts, 1937, 66 minRiding the Cherokee Trail, 1941, 59 minTex Ritter called it a career 5 years before I was born, nonethelss, he's one of my favorite cowboys.The movies in this DVD are not pristine. Digital restoration or remasterization cleans up the picture somewhat, but will not eliminate scratches. Anyway, this is a good buy all around. The movies seem to be uncut, and for the price you pay, $5,99, you will be satisfied, especially if you like Tex's music."
1,"Pardon me for stating the obvious, but...","There are SEVEN ""Road"" pictures, not four. One more DVD product without the proper care and consideration a small child would have given it."
4,Excellent!,"I read this book about 5 years ago at JNU, New Delhi and found it to be very good at historical analysis of culure and narratives, especially seen from a women's point of view. I also liked the way it focussed on literary ""genres""--and their role in the politics of conduct. I recommend it to those interested in cultural analysis, feminism, historicism, and narratology."
2,Living Like Indians,"The book is like a ""wanna be"" boy scout handbook. Where it referenced indians and chiefs you could substitute scouts and patrol leaders. Much of the information is good camping and outdoor woodskills related, with a smattering of indian lore. Many of the illustrations look like they are directly out of a boy scout manual. If you are interested in a real authentic look at native american life and activities, you will not want this book. If you are looking for something to use as a companion to your existing outdoor library or for more juvenile activities, then you could benefit from this book."
2,What were they thinking?,"This movie has the look and feel (and probably budget) of a FOX TV movie, and a bad one at that. The plot has horrid and the acting almost as bad. This movie has almost no redeeming qualities other than the fact it's mindless and doesn't require you to pay attention (a good date movie for some, I guess). Rent it for two bucks if you really must see it."
2,low-brow and predictable,"Well, it looks as though anyone who gives this movie a bad rating is bound to get a bunch of unhelpful votes, but the fact of the matter is that Bats is a bad movie. It's the type of movie that's been made umpteen times before: there's some major crisis, a rag-tag group sets out to solve the crisis (often in defiance of inept authorities), but with all the odds stacked against them it looks mighty certain that they're going to fail, but just in the nick of time they pull it off. In short, this is a low-brow, predictable movie. Granted, it could have been worse--the production quality was okay and it was somewhat enntertaining--but in the end it is still a bad movie."
5,Its Excellent,"Hi ,Whoever going to purchase this product what can i say for you about this product is its simply superb.Its really really really very very very good.Dont get hesitate just go for it.Before buying this product i reviewed various hdd models of all the brands i could find finally this was the best model from sony.But if sony launches the same features with viewfinder then it is helping out a lot.But just wait for good deal as i have done.The average best deal you get this product is in between 700-725.E N J O Y ! ! !"
2,Not working after 2 years,"We bought the camcorder 2 years ago. It worked excellently for 2 years and after that suddenly the screen went black. The battery is fine because if I put the battery on a different camcorder, it shows that it has 152 mins worth of recording time left. Searching the internet I found that lot of people had similar issues of LCD screen going black after 2 years of using the camera.If I connect the camcorder directly to an electrical outlet it works for couple of minutes and then goes black again. I am unable to copy the images and videos because the camcorder should be turned on to copy the media.In conclusion I am happy with the product but that only lasted for 2 years, I should have bought a 5 year warranty."
3,somthing for everyone--except the self rightious,"o'donnel and akroid are funny as cops who find that maybe the sickos are just people having fun. delany is talented and very sexy, and with all the things going on, i found myself laughing alot"
2,Poor adaption of a great book,Overall the movie was average. But it should have been kept closer to Anne Rice's book of the same name. I recommend that you should read the book instead.
1,you must be joking,are you serious? rosie odonnel in S & M gear! do not watch this movie while eating or you are just asking for trouble. odonnel has no business ever wearing anything but a moo moo. i lost respect or akroyd for participating in this good for nothing romp through hell. avoid watching this movie at all cost.
2,Titillating Tripe,"I first viewed this movie on HBO or something several years ago and was quite intrigued by the plot premise. My opinion is that this COULD have been an interesting and stimulating exploration of human kink...(but NOOOOOOOOO). I thought the movie began to explore and illustrate some of the mental and emotional aspects of a dominant/submissive relationship and found the scene of bondage and light discipline exciting and exhilerating. But then....the meddling hands of Gary Marshall et al, turned Ms. Rice's Exit To Eden into some bizarre hybrid from hell in hopes of increasing its commerical marketability.I guess America is not ready for an honest, thought-provoking look at actual sexual/erotic behaviors. I'm really sorry Exit became Bowderized by the addition of ""comedy"" and a subversive co-plot. Maybe I'll read Ms. Rice's book before someone starts burning them."
1,split personality,"After turning Pretty Woman from a dark story about prostitution into a romantic comedy, Gary Marshall tried the same tack with Anne Rice's nasty little novel about sexual obsession. Well, he made a movie that is neither erotic nor funny. Worse, it feels split down the middle, and needlessly overplotted in order to merge the two sides.This film comes from the vast middle period of bad Dan Ackroyd films--put it in the same batch as Dragnet. Sometimes dumb and clumsy isn't funny, it's just dumb and clumsy, like a bloated uncle left to watch the kids after Thanksgiving dinner--which begs the question, when did Ackroyd give up on being sharp-edged?"
5,Excellent pow-wow music,This is the kind of pow-wow CD we listen to here on the rez. None of that new age silliness!!
3,Good Book,I love the way this book reviews the designs and brings them to life for you. I only wish there were a way to print the plans to ease in building models or full size boats. other than the printing options I love the book.
2,Inferior to Christenson,"The Popul Vuh is a wonderful insight into the Maya mindset by way of cosmological, social, and lingual perspective. The way the language is represented and translated, and what is explained is decent here from Tedlock, but only that, decent. Allen J. Christenson's dual complimenting approach let's the reader decide which way to first absorb this material while engaging their understanding in a far more effective and accurate way. Check out his version."
1,Valve leaks,"Valve leaks on both tanks first time filled. PMI sent new o-rings. Difficult to replace and a waste of time because they both leaked again. Steer clear of push on/off valves. The reviews referring this issue are correct, I only wish I had known before buying."
3,Disappointed - Death In Paradise,"Having enjoyed both the orginal Stone Cold movie, and also Night Passage,I anxiously waited the continuation. However, Death in Paradise, dosnt pick up right after and in following the prequel Night Passage.This to me was really disappointing. Instead of picking up right from theending of Night Passage, it takes off what appears as probably several months or longer after Night Passage, and leaves the viewer with the sense of missing time, from where Night Passage ended and Death in Paradise picks up....Tom Selleck was excellent once again, but with the apparent gap in time,and some unanswered question, in disppointment, I could only give a3 star ratiing for this sequel...."
4,Jesse Stone: Death In Paradise,Robert Parker has another character to rival Spencer in Jesse Stone and Tom Selleck has bought him to life Death in Paradise is the next chapter in the Jesse Stone series. Selleck brings a world weary but honorable character who is willing to overlook the fine print of the law to get the job done right. A good way to spend some time with a bag of popcorn and a comfortable spot on the couch.
5,Entertaining and Rewarding,"A great primer for philosophical thought that does not put one to sleep. In fact, this was such a good read, it kept me up late into for several evenings. Professor Rowlands also happens to be one funny man. Very well done."
2,Package tour blues,"An unused cache of b/w photos from the Stones autumn 1963 tour of Britain is unearthed, and a rather portentous text is assembled around it. Worth owning if you buy it used."
4,Steve Howe unbelievable! Excellant Yes live !,"When I heard track 1 Yours is no Disgrace I said Wow! Steve Howe's playing was alive ! The energy and improv is great, new working of it by the musicians.. I didn't think that the energy and effort in YIND was carried on throught the concert recording but they did a Great job.. Awaken was another highlight, Igor leaving more of us his style on the tune.. And You and I was very good as well..I got to appreciate the newer songs more on the video, I'll leave a review on that as well..Yes abu! Yes forever !"
5,Fun for all ages,"We received this present for my son when he was born. When we finally put it together, I thought he would love the toy part with the phone and the snail (that part props up on its own). When my 3.5 year old daughter saw the toy, she claimed it as hers! She loves the scooter. Now that my son is 8.5 months they have to share, as he is obsessed with pushing the walker."
4,comfortable shorts.,"very comfortable shorts. great material. i run w/ these shorts. and, i like them."
1,Sigh!!!!!,The pink rug is a very pale pink rug. Would not buy it again!!!!I tried to contact Amazon to return it and it has been over 2 weeks and I still have not heard from them.
5,My childhood,"I grew up with these books but had not read them in a while. They were just as I remembered them as a kid. But I liked the new cartoon artwork on the covers, especially of Killer the ""rabbit?""It was a journey back in time."
2,Where are the maps?,This free edition does not have the maps which make the situation much more understandable. Spring for the version with the maps!
3,What on Earth is the Moral of this Story?,Strange tale for a young kid. Babe Ruth as a child steals a dollar from dad to buy his friends ice cream and runs away from a beating at home. What?????? This story is a strange tale in the manner it is told.
1,HORRIBLE....,"I purchased this book, signed by the author, at a school event and when I read it to my 5 yr old I was astonished. Page 22: ""George didn't like to lie. His father went down to the basement to get his paddle."" Page 28-End: ""Mr. Ruth came up the stairs from the basement. He looked angry. George knew what would happen next. He ran out the front door before his father could catch him! 'Come back here, George!' his father yelled. Mrs. Ruth watched her son, and wondered what would become of him.""Is this what we want to read and teach our kids? Is this what you want our public schools selling?The pictures that go along with the dialog are terrible. I contacted my public school district and returned the book. I do NOT recommend purchasing this book and providing the author with any additional royalties from such a horrible story. I only gave it one star because you had to, otherwise it would be zero."
1,standard carnival glass price guide 12th ed,not user friendly to a beginning collector.too difficult to use.can't find what i'm looking for..
3,Wagons West-Washington,"The price for this used paperback was exhorbitant.However, I needed it to complete the set of 24 books in the Wagons West series. I ordered this book and 11 others on the same day, and the prices for the other books was well within the range for a used book. Couldn't understand why there was such a big difference in the price of this particular book."
3,whats the name of the song with jada and sheik ?,thats so funny-i want this song for reference-i love catchin mc's from back in the day-put me on to that song 1
5,Awesome flavor:,"I've been eating a lot of jerky lately, this one takes the cake! The pieces are a little on the tough side, but since it's quality meat it wasn't a problem at all. The flavor starts out immediately being sweet, but after a few seconds a nice medium heat comes in. I would not have guessed the flavor was cajun if I didn't know, but don't let that stop you. This is the best sweet/hot jerky I've ever tasted. What a wonderful unique flavor. I will definitely order this again."
5,Abrahamsen: The Jewish Genius,"Dr. Abrahamsen has got to be one of the most brilliant men of our time. His intellect and astuteness rival those of Freud and Einstein. His book, Mind of the Accused : APITC, has got to be one of the top 10 pyschology books I've ever read.Abrhamsen goes into what makes a criminal a criminal, important aspects, and amazing theories. This book is a metropolis of information and insight into the criminal mind, a must read for anyone who wants to know about the subject. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read."
5,Excellent! Demystifies JSP and Servlets,"This book is excellent, excellent, excellent! The authors have a gift for developing the topic of JSP, Servlets, and building a Java-based ecommerce site in a methodical easy-to-understand approach. Just the right amount of explantion so that you never get bogged down in words and witicisms.I was looking for courseware to teach the topic. This book is written like instructor-led-training. It IS courseware.It may be the best information technology book I have seen, and I have bought dozens. Thanks Andrea and Joel!"
2,Needs a new revision,"I bought this because Amazons pairing system linked this book to a JDK6 book with a publication date of 2007. This book was published in 2003! That'll teach me to check the publication date of the links.This book is fine if you are still using Tomcat 4.1 as a release enviroment for your web apps. If you are like the rest of the world and have moved on to Tomcat 5 or 6, then forget it. This means the 2.1/1.2 Servlet/JSP specs rather than the 2.5/2.1 spec. From 1.2->2.1 there have been some powerful additions to the tagging which you obviously won't find any info on in here.I'll give the book 2 stars as it is well laid out, thought there are a few niggles where the content is wrong, but nothing major."
5,Fantastic,"I actually had the wonderful opportunity to meet the Wihan Quartet while they were in the U.S. in 1999 and own several of their CD's. While I believe they have the corner on Czech music (their Dvorak is some of the best I've ever heard), their Beethoven cycle is truly fantastic. The quartet sound simply shimmers, and their use of drama throughout this music is both tasteful and wonderfully effective. I always thoroughly enjoy listening to their recordings."
5,Excellent,I was very impressed by this book. It really sums the sense of 'making do' in post war Britain as well as dealing with the social constraints of the time.At times I wanted to shout at Sam & Ellen to stop them making a fateful mistake! ...read this book.
5,Great Alternative Christmas Album,"I heard Ms. Jones sing ""One Little Boy"" on Austin's KUT ""Eklektikos"" program last year and immediately went out to buy this album. That song alone is worth the price of the CD, but you will find no 'clunkers' on this album. She has a really powerful voice, with a wide range of emotion. The songs range from the traditional (The Christmas Song), to the reverent (One Little Boy), to the truly sexy (You Light Me Up, and Sexy, Saucy...). This is one my absolute favorite Christmas albums, and one of only two that I could listen to anytime of the year (the other being Brave Combo's ""It's Christmas Man!""."
3,Devotional or Apologetic?,"William Lane Craig is one of the foremost apologists of our time.Even though WLC introduces his book in the Preface as ""my first attempt at a devotional-style book"" its difficult for me to dampen his apologetic tone - Maybe its because I have listened to so many of his well prepared and intelligently crafted defences of the Christian faith that I can only hear an apologia throughout the book.He addresses;Chapters;1. Doubt2. Unanswered Prayer3. Failure4. Suffering and Evil I5. Suffering and Evil II6. HellNo IndexI enjoy reading and listening to WLC even though I don't agree with all his positions (eg. Molinism).I would recommend this book more as a primer to apologetics that devotion. If you want devotion, maybe try some of Thomas a Kempis."
5,a fantastic movie,"The movie (A Walk To Remember) was a bit boring but it was fantastic and the main characters(Landon and Jamie) had chemistry, also Mandy and Shane did great performances and the storyline was believable.It is one of the better teen movies and more importantly Jamie dosen't have to change her image to fit in.I would say the soundtrack is fantastic and realy helps the iffect of the movie.It did the book great justice and was a quite touching movie.Mandy is a great new found talent and her and Shane make a great on-screen couple."
5,The Dark Nature Of Mankind,"`Quills' is a dark, erotic, sensual and textured period film based on the life of the Marquis de Sade during his incarceration in a castle designated as a home for the mentally ill. As shown on this 11"" x 17"" reproduction poster you see the alledgedly depraved Marquis (Geoffrey Rush) pawing at the lovely chambermaid played by the lusty Kate Winslet. This one is definitely a nice piece, especially for Winslet fans."
1,What's that burning smell?,I got this as a gift to replace a worn out model of similar design. I have to throw this loser away. There is a burning smell in my kitchen every time I use it. I think it's the red paint on the outside. My old one was plain stainless and it was never an issue. Also the flimsy construction of this model (very thin metal) leads to uneven heat distribution and the clamps on the top being very easily bent out of shape.
5,The Spice Girls rules at all!,"Well, I bough this book just because I like the Spice Girls. I though that reading it would be fun. I was wrong! The book is great, I loved it! You know, when you buy a book you are kinda buying some fun but that one is so fun as the Spice Girls. The book tells you all their adventures, working on their first movie. I felt like I was in there with them (specially when I read Geri's diary). I think the Spice Girls are great and after this book, I know they are real too. Even after Geri leaving the group. No more words, just FUN FUN FUN !"
3,Great chronicle of a fascinating film,"For those Spice Girls fans like myself who think they're the best thing to come along in decades, having a diary of their film SPICEWORLD is de rigeur...a must for the book collection! And the photos, text, and commentary, by the Spice Girls themselves, certainly doesn't disappoint...it's a lively mixture of outspoken views, daily experiences, and a preview of the film, now long since released and available on home video. It's certainly a book everyone should read, especially those with negative attitudes toward life who need a good shot of positivity and self-esteem. If these girls from Britain can do it, so can anyone...man or woman, young or old. Just know what you really, really want, and anything is possible. This is a great collector's item for those who genuinely believe that the Spice Girls have made a difference, just as we all can!"
4,Diary of the Girls,I liked this book but I was still a little disappointed. It was nothing really but diary entries. What I liked about the book was the pictures and the behind the scene stuff.****
5,Very cool...gotta get it,"If you're a Spice fan, you simply must get this great book. It's got tons of pictures, and great behind the scenes stuff. The best part is the diary that Geri wrote the whole time they were filming. PS: I miss Geri a lot and I wish she hadn't left. :("
3,Set of 3 not 6 as advertised,Actually i haven't tried them yet. They look perfectly fine. What upsets me is that it is sold as a set of 6. What arrives is actually 6 corn holders. We all use 2 per cob right? So it is a set of three. I don't know if I would have paid this much money for a set of three corn cob holders.
3,Sell Dynasty to Shout! Factory,"CBS/Paramount I think you should sell Dynasty to Shout! Factory. Shout! will be willing to re-release the first 2 Seasons of Dynasty, and release Seasons 3-9 in COMPLETE SEASONS. You will lose support from the fans if you keep releasing Dynasty Seasons in 2 Separate Volume Sets. Please sell Dynasty to Shout! Factory."
1,Half a season for the price of a whole year? No thanks.,"Like so many of the other reviewers, I refuse to fall victim to CBS-Paramount's preposterous marketing ploy. Fans deserve full season sets at reasonable prices. Until ""Dynasty""'s third season is available as a single set, I will not buy it."
1,Ah I get it......,"The studio is demonstrating it's fierce business strategy in the true cents of the word just like the Carrington's & Colby's did. Just remember they too hit rock bottom at some point.....I won't be buying this new, I've waited so long what's another year!!!!!"
1,Volumes are ridiculous and I won't buy into it!,"I am an avid TV on DVD buyer and like to have all of my shows immediately when they are released but thewhole ""season 3 volume 1"" routine is just ABSURD. We all know better. It would be one thing if they charged any less for the split seasons but they don't. I waited this long to re-watch Dynasty...I can wait until I can get a used copy. Paramount should be ashamed of this crap and they'll end up killing sales of the series. I'll be busy watching Season 9 of DALLAS (all in one volume! imagine that!)"
1,Vol. 1...are you kidding???,"I'm a huge fan of Joan Collins and loved watchin Dynasty back in the day. I've thought of buying Dynasty on DVD before and still might. At least the first two seasons. But I wouldn't even ask my partner to buy me season three for Christmas. Splitting the season's up into seperate volumes!?! Give me a frickin break. Maybe when ""you know what"" freezes over..."
5,A must read! I noticed Stephen King gave it a good review!,"This is simply a great read - it is obvious that Kellerman spent a lot of time researching this topic - there is so much factual info in this book regarding the treatment of mental illness & other matters. He keeps you guessing throughout the book on how this will turn out, whether the main character did indeed murder people, or is something else at work.A great read, beginning to end - with lots of twists and turns - I loved it!"
4,Hard to put down,"I only recently became a Kellerman reader, and I have enjoyed this book quite a lot. I am an avid mystery reader and, even though I find Alex Delaware pretty unbelievable, I enjoy him. In this series this one came second only to the Murder Book. My favourite Kellerman so far, however, is Billy Straight (possibily even more unbelievable but, then, I simply devour Harry Potter, despite being a grown-up). Just be sure to start this book when you have a free weekend..."
3,"Good Yarn But Unrealistic, Contrived","This too-long, book kept me interested mostly because of the plot twists and the arcania about psychological things. But, on the other hand, a lot of the plot felt contrived with far too many serendpitous events which served only to enable the author to make another plot turn. Some of it was very un-realistic: a shrink wouldn't act the way Delaware does in some of the situations, and it's highly unlikely that any professional police force would allow Delaware to be so personally involved in much of the investigation and ultimate denouement. Diehard Kellerman fans will probably love this offering; I'm lukewarm about it."
3,Just OK..,"This book was just ok. It was soooo long. It was extremely ""wordy"". I thought there were so many things that were said that really didn't need to be. Sort of redundant. I hated that you only got one small look at the ""killer"". Just wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be."
1,Frequent flats,"I bought these on recommendation from a local shop - no more flats they claimed. Expensive, but worth it right? Well in the first 15 days of riding I've had three flats. After the first I returned the tire to the shop for a new one, then that tire got a flat too. Sheesh.The first flat (day two of riding) was a weird sidewall blowout, maybe a defect in the manufacture of the tire. The second and third were from pieces of gravel slicing the tread all the way through to the tube. Just regular gravel from a bike path. So now I have a useless $50 tire with two holes in it, and another that I don't trust. Very disappointing.I should note that I've been riding my bike everywhere my life takes me for the last ten years, and am very experienced in installing and caring for tires.In the past I've had success with Bontrager race lite tires, which are cheaper to boot."
4,tire,I got this tire and have probably put over 500 miles on them and they are holding up just fine As long as I use good tubes I don't seem to have much problems. They do grip the road when it rains and I have ran over some debris and sugar cane while riding. These tires seem to hold up to what I have put it through so far.
5,Excellent service & product,I watched Silver spoons when it first came out and loved it ever since. I am waiting and hoping Sony comes out with the rest of the series. Loyal fan.
5,Great Phone ... Way Better than Motorola,"After owning a motorola t720, i don't think I'll ever buy anything else with the motorola name. It had horrible battery life and it was completely full of glitches. This phone is a huge upgrade and the swivel design has caught on since other companies are now making phones that look exactly like this Kyocera(like the Sony Ericcson swivel.) Here are the pros and consPros:Good battery life(Make sure you have a screensaver activated)Great menusHuge ScreenAbility to answer and make calls while phone is closedYou don't have to swivel it open to answer!Voice dialingspeakerphoneGood price if you buy with serviceCons:1.2 megapixel Camera not as good as some of the newer phonesI wish it could swivel in both directionsI've had it for a year and I haven't got any scratches on the screen and no dust inside the screen like my old motorola,and I've dropped it 3 times."
1,Distracting format,I use an iPod Touch with Kindle application: This book formatted with everything but titles underlined. Very distracting.
4,"A practical, comprehensive guide to knowledge management","I am not a knowledge manager, however I wanted to get to grips with how I can use knowledge to benefit my department. I found this book practical and easy to read, it is a comprehensive source of insights into the future knowledge business and the opportunities arising. I think this is important outline for anyone who wants to make practical use of knowledge management - without the hype. Buy it!"
3,Pleasantly Strange,"This was a pleasantly strange book. I liked the idea that Matt can talk to inanimate objects and I liked Edmunds sense of magic and mystery, however - there were a few things that bothered me. For one thing, calling Edmund a witch seems a bit out of whack. I don't think that's an accurate description of what a witch is. The only other problem was how quickly things moved! I barely had the chance to meet Edmund and they were off like old chums from school. Then everyone has thier life turned upside down only minutes after meeting Matt. It was too fast, but the story was intruiging enough to keep me going and make me want to read other books.I think you'll like this book if you can read ""through"" things like this. You have to be able to ignore certain things and read around others. All in all I liked the characters and the storyline, I intend to get another book by this author soon."
5,A Classic Reference for Nuclear Thoery,"Blatt and Weisskopf is a good, thick compendium of nuclear theory developed from a quantum mechanical point of view. It's become something of a classic it its time, and I think this is well deserved, since it is written with a good flow and clarity and also covers everything a nonspecialist in nuclear physics would ever need to know (and provides a good basis for those who are specialists). The Dover edition is nice and also inexpensive. I would highly recommend it as a reference for all physics and chemistry people."
5,Compelling Evidence for the Origin of Modern Religion,"I bought this book to further clarify the origin of the stories (myths) of the Bible -- Genesis creation story, Noah and the flood, Moses and the Law, resurrection stories, etc. This book enlightens one on this and much more. Easy and entertaining read (though serious). Fascinating to learn about the most ancient known civilization, and how its mythologists and poets and stories (as recorded on tablets) have shaped subsequent civilizations and gave rise to ancient pagan religions and our own modern religions."
3,A good start on Sumeria,"This book is well-organized but it still has the feel and look of the original edition of 1956. It has a lot of good information but I can't help thinking that archeology has probably provided us even more insight than we had 50 years ago. What should be added? Worse, what info in this book has since been found to be incorrect?Nevertheless, this book opens the door on our first civilization, and one we cannot appreciate enough."
2,Not as Good as the Original,"Brown and Dennehy return in this sequel to the 1987 hit about a special effects man who stages a fake hit on an organized crime boss. Unfortunately, this film is more like a clone in many ways than a sequel.Once again, Brown's character works with law enforcement to stage an event (you think he would have learned by now) this time to trap a killer. Again he uses his special effects tricks to get out of various scrapes. He once again gets in a fight with a hired killer, and once again throws food and kitchen objects at the killer-well you get the idea.This film is just too predictable to be very good. If they had taken the same formula and added a new twist of some kind it could have been a decent sequel. As it is, rent this one if you must see it."
5,This book is wildly good,"The gorgeous imagery of the West is what makes this so incredibly amazing. There are lightning storms, hail, floods, fires, grizzly bears, guns--even murder and intrigue. Who knew there was so much going on in Montana? I highly recommend this beautifully written book."
4,Very good read on the North Fork,"I found this to be a great read on the North Fork (of the Flathead River) in northwestern Montana. Some interesting and intriguing true stories by those that lived in the area. (I am very familiar with the North Fork, as our kids have cabins up there, and we visit the area virtually every year. A beautiful, unspoiled wilderness area. ...for now anyhow.)"
1,Very disappointed .,Big disappointment - very difficult to sing along with. Ordered it for a party at a Senior Center - did not go over well.
2,Flawed,After looking at several Christmas karaoke CD's and their reviews I thought this one might work. How is it possible to screw up Christmas music? The arrangements are awful and most lack even a semblance of the melody of the songs. I don't mind if there aren't background vocals but when there's no melody it's very hard to sing the song. The other reason this purchase will be returned is the poor quality of the graphics. Words and lines are incomplete and there are areas of what I can only describe as pixilations. So I will be returning the product.
4,Alternative medicine at it's best,"Rosita Arvigo and Dr. Balick have written a very good book about the her experiences with a Mayan shaman in Belize. It gives great insights about the vanishing breed of ""bush"" doctors. Good for anyone who wants to study the ethnobotany of Mayas or alternative medicines in general especially those made with tropical plants and herbs."
2,BETTER AS PART OF A GROUP!,"The first solo cd by KELLY ROWLAND of DESTINY'S CHILD was a great effort but sadly falls far shy of stellar. STOLE AND DILEMMA (FEATURING NELLY) are the only two standout tracks. The rest of the album is filler....R&B, Hip-Hop, Pop, etc.....I am not sure what the theme and point was supposed to be. Better luck next time....if you are looking for a cd close to the style of DESTINY'S CHILD, this is NOT it!"
5,HEYY YA,This is one of the best cd's I've ever heard let me list the tracks and rate them 1 lowest 10 highestStole I love this song so much I give it a 9Dilemma Good song 8Haven't told you This and beyonce be with you I love them 10Can't Nobody This song is tight! 9Love/Hate my FAVORITE song on the cd 10Simply deep This song is alright 7Love lives in strange places love the song 8.5Obsession- This is a great love song 7BEyond Imagination This song is ok I barely listen to it 6Past 12 I LOOOVE this song 10Everytime you walk out that door Great breakup song it's great for a good cry 9Train on a track- Nice song lovey but tight 8Heaven supposed to be number 9 it's not that good but i like the feeling if the song 5Make U wanna stayit tight in the same form as dilemma but kind of like dilemmas 2 feat joe budden 9
4,Simply Deep Enough,"This CD is amazing. Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child is going solo. I personally think that Kelly Rowland has a beautiful voice that only partly came through from Destinys child. I rated this CD 4/5 because some of the songs are a little boring but they have deep meaning. If you like songs that have a strong music, and you enjoyed Destinys Child then this is the CD for you. I personally enjoyed it with its soft beats and its fast tracks. It was great!Overall: Check it out! Great."
4,How could no one see the obvious similarities?,"Wow! First, let me start off by saying that this album is going to shock a lot of people who expected a Destiny's Child-esque vibe...her far-reaching and far-ranging influences shine through. But there is one whom I've rarely heard her compared to (except for live performances) that I'm sure she'll soon be compared to (favorably, I must say)...the divine Whitney Houston. I mean come on, look at her...look at Whitney's first album cover. They are almost spitting images of each other at 21-22. Listen to the tone fo her voice, and how she has complete control of her instument (without oversinging)...doesn't it remind anyone of Whitney...a Whitney who has learned the gift of understatement. Granted, the rock edge of this album will surely throw people away from that comparison...but put her beauty and her voice up against any female solo artist today...and she's right up there! Do your thang, girl!!!"
2,Mediocre,"The beats on this album are rejects. I hate to think that everything is a plot, but it has to cross your mind that maybe Matthew made certain Kelly didn't get the best. When you have Solange writting material for you, something is up. There are some half way enjoyable tracks, but I could not play this album all the way through more than once. I wish the best to Kelly though."
3,Well..,"I don't know what to say about this album its alright,she sounds like Beyonce alil bit in her songs.But overall its AIGHT.1.Stole- 4 1/2/52.Dilemma- 4 1/2/53.Havent told you- 3/54.Cant nobody- 3/55.Love/Hate- 3/56.Simply deep- 5/57.Love lives in)Strange places- 4/58.Obsession- 3/59.Heaven- 3/510.Past 12- 5/511.Everytime you walk out that door- 3/512.Train on a track- 5/513.Beyond Imagination- 3/5Bonus- Make you wanna stay- 3/5"
4,Kelly shows she has what it takes...,"Kelly really surprised me with this album. When I heard she was coming out with an album I didn't think it would do too well because I didn't think she could handle the spotlight on her alone. She definitely proved me wrong! The album is perfect! Production is on point as well as her vocal skills. Songs like ""Haven't Told You"", ""Obsession"", and ""Everytime You Walk Out That Door"" show that Ms. Rowland has SOLO star quality, that doesn't mean she should stay on her own though. So basically, Kelly proved she can definitely hold her own!"
4,Get off the Beyonce train & join the Kelly Express!!,This has got to be one of the most slept-on albums of the past few years. Kelly may not have Beyonce's glamourous looks but she has a way better voice than Ms. Ross (oops my bad-I mean Ms. Knowles). Pick this album up pronto!!
3,good,Very good read. The storytelling was a little old-fashioned. The history and setting were exotic and interesting. It was a refreshing change of pace from the romances I have been reading.
4,"Surprisingly, it works.","The thumbfit helps in a small way by restricting movements, reminding others not to squeeze your hand too hard when shaking it, and somehow much of the pain goes away. I would order another one, if needed. Because hands perspire, this gets a ""gamey smell quickly. Washing it with baby shampoo and warm water works well."
3,Good adventure movie,This one is a good movie if you like the coming of age teen movies. Lance Hienrikson is a great teacher and role model for the kids that are out in the wilderness to learn more about themselves and how they view the world and how the world views them. Everyone one of them is put to the test when it comes to testing their stregnth and weakness and with a surprise as to who is the strongest of them all.
2,Slow road to decent ending,"Not what I expected. I was hoping for a good survival movie, but this one was so slow to get to any decent action or story. I would not recommend buying it. Rent it maybe, if you are curious. Disappointing to me. Watch ""To Brave Alaska"" if you want a really good survival story."
1,cover defective product.,"The product I bought, with less than a month the cover that holds the batteries broke loose at the bottom, thus, the only safe lock up. Other than that I really liked the product."
4,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"While the item was shipped quickly and everything seemed to work ok. I ended up with one problem. When I plug in the battery pack grip my flash either does not work or is very sparatic in operation. I thought it was the off brand battery I was using so I installed a genuine Nikon battery. To no avail, I still did not regain my flash function until I disconnected the battery pack and installed the battery directly into the camera, which defeats the purpose if you ask me. I will be buying the Nikon MB-D80 battery pack because the grip is very convenient but I can no longer use this particular brand. I hope I just received a lemon and no one else is having the same issue."
2,grip too large,I got the grip and before I even put it on the camera it didn't fit in my hand. I would not recommend this grip
3,"If you really need a battery grip, buy the Nikon","When I purchased this I was skeptical about the product due to some of the reviews, but I figured I couldn't go wrong because of the two batteries included with kit. As far as I'm concerned, two batteries is what I got out of this. I wanted a grip that would make shooting in portrait orientation more comfortable, but this grip is too slick to hold onto comfortably and confidently. While I haven't bought the Nikon grip yet, I tried it in a camera shop. I can believe the Nikon and Opteka are formed in the same molds, but the Nikon was definitely made of a denser plastic. More importantly the Nikon has a rubberized surface on the front for an improved grip on the camera. That's really all the Opteka product is missing, but it's a big deal. The last thing anybody needs is a shaky grip on $3000 dollars worth of camera, lens & flash. Unless you have very large hands, spend the extra $$ on the OEM product."
4,A very interesting book on Asian Economies,"It presents a thorough illustration on the 1997/1998 Asian crisis based on strong analytical ground, and the role of China in shaping Asia's economic future.Inspiring in its case studies, one on `China's Pressure on Hong Kong' and the other on `China's Pressure on Taiwan'. A lively and concise book, which provokes the question of `Will China become the number one economic powerhouse in the 21st Century'?"
1,Did we read the same book?,"As I browsed a few of the other reviews on this page, I couldn't help but think WHY DID YOU LIKE THIS BOOK? Even if you loved The Lord of the Rings, as I did, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like this book. I found it much too dense and confusing for my taste, and had to draw up charts and diagrams to understand any of it. To sum it up, this book was NOT worth the read."
1,The presumption of sons,"If Tolkien had intended this book to be more than working notes towards a history of Middle Earth, he would have published it on his own. However, his son's money-grubbing has begun a horrible tradition of talentless sons pillaging the notebooks of their fathers, a tradition that has resulted in the continuation of an already tortured Dune series in addition to the collections of partial tales by Tolkien released after his death.He must be spinning in his grave."
4,Kindle Book Expensive,Why on earth is the kindle version so expensive compared to the printed version? It's ridiculous! I won't buy until the price is lowered to (at least) the price of the paperback version.
2,No where near as good as his other books,"I give it two stars because I'm a Tolkien fan, but it's like reading a phonebook."
3,Touch And Go!,"This book is a prequel to The Lord of The Rings. It starts with the creation of Middle Earth and how it came about. It talks about the fall of one of The Valor and the first wars. This book is a must read for any Lord of The Rings fan, it gives you the history and fills in some of the gaps the Lord of The Rings leaves for us. However, as I say in my title the book is touch and go. The book is well developed in some areas and in others you can notice the lack of development. I will not lie this book is poorly written, but this can be attributed to the death of Tolkien before it's completion. I found the book at times hard to follow and it was often slow reading. The ease of reading the Lord of The Rings is not present in this book. The jumps in time or place are often abrupt and jagged, almost irritating. If you are not a patient reader, I would not recommend this book."
4,Another great JRR Book,I thought this was a really great book. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Can't wait to re-read. Sometimes it was hard to follow the multiple names for people and things. Appendix in back was a big help with that.
4,"A good deal, but not accurately represented.","This is a great companion piece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'm enjoying having it, and this was a good deal for what I got. My only complaint is that it was marked as ""like new"" condition, but when I got it, it had a small tear in the front cover. That wasn't enough to ruin it for me, though, as you can see from the 4 star rating I gave it."
1,a snooze,I thought this book was very boring. There was too much going on and it was too confusing. Everyone says this book is so great but whats so great about it. Iwould not advise you to buy this book. It is a bad buy.
5,This book may not be for some people,"I LOVED lord of the rings and the hobbit so I decided to read this book even though at first I had no clue what it was about.When I first started reading it I was fascinated at how deep it delved into the history of middle earth, so now if you see any references to lore in the lord of the rings after reading this book you can say ""hey I remember that"". However this book can probably only be read by serious readers who can stand what is basicly a history book. There are man6y interesting tales in this that are part of the shaping of middle earth in fact the entire book is. Some people have tried to associate tolkien with the occult but all that is a huge lie(seriously the guy was a christian) in fact some of the storyline is similar to the bible like the fall of the Noldar. ***PLEASE NOTE: This review was written by my teenage son who accidentally logged into my account. I like the review, and I trust his judgment, so the review stays."
3,Dry but Informative,"So vast is the history of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy realm of Middle-Earth, that it spawned over a dozen offshoot volumes editted by Christopher Tolkien from his father's notes. The largest and most acclaimed of these is ""The Silmarillion."" It is most defineately complete... the scope and detail is utterly astonishing. However, to date I have not been able to complete it. After ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", I had expected perhaps a more personal tale with ""The Silmarillion."" Not so. Unlike the previous two, this is written more like a history novel... entire wars pass by in a few pages, characters come and go in the blink of an eye. This makes for incredibly dry reading... only the devoted Tolkien fan would be able to really enjoy.Still, the scope is perhaps the greatest of all the Tolkien literature, and the detail and richness of his world is really expanded here, fleshing out references made in 'Hobbit' and 'Rings.' If you enjoyed those, you should give this a try."
1,"Great read, terrible book","First off, this IS NOT a review of the content in the Silmarillion, as that would be a 5 star review.The construction of this hardcover is almost bad enough to make the book unreadable: the back binding cracked on first open, the book does hold evenly, and the construction is not symmetrical. I'm not sure if this even makes sense as I've never discussed book construction before, but beware of this $11 hardcover if you have any care for aesthetic quality. I was hoping to place this along my other books on my bookshelf, but it looks too much like a street vendor bible."
3,From a Lord of the Rings fan...,"This book, mostly written by Tolkien, with large parts edited and written by his son, is an excellent read for Tolkien lovers and purists, but if you are not one of those two, you will have trouble getting through this book. I had read Lord of the Rings twice when I tried reading this for the first time, and it took me three tries to be able to make it through the entire thing. Once I did, I was satisfyed and will most likly read it again every few years(as I do with the Lord of the Rings). Still, the language in this is not nearly as fluid, well-mastered, or as beautiful as in LOTR. And while it provides great amounts of interesting back story, and I appreciate the LOTR and the other books in Middle-Earth because of it, this was not required reading, nor was it as entertaining or thrilling as LOTR. All and all, a worthy read if you can get through it, but that may be a daunting obsticle indeed for most casual readers."
5,The absolute best of Tolkien,"Have you ever wanted to know the stories BEHIND all the characters in LOTR? Ever wondered why the elves are immortal? Do you want more information on the wizdards?? Are you curious how Sauron forged the ""One Ring""? GET THE SILMARILLION!! I started reading The Lord of the Rings when I was in 9th grade. I never finished it until I saw the movies. I became obsessed with the trilogy. After reading all 3 books, I wanted a clearer understanding of where all the cool characters came from. The Silmarillion is THE BOOK and THE KEY to understanding and enjoying LOTR. A MUST for any fan of Middle Earth!"
3,Beautiful scenes,"From other reviews, you can tell this is a movie that doesn't connect at all with some people. Regardless of whether you get anything cultural, sociological, psychological, linguistic or escapist out of this film (and I did...all of these): It has some beautiful cinematography! There are many oustanding night and ocean scenes, plus some attractive women and men."
3,Functional,"Compared to my previous leather passport wallet, this one was stiffer - feels like cardboard inside. I expect it will soften with use. One of the card pocket panels separated from its backing (1/2"") on first day of use. Generally nice look & some thought put into the design. I'd be happy to pay a bit more for more luxurious feel but ok for the price paid. I will use it (I travel international monthly) as it holds what I need and is the right size."
4,St. Pat's Hat,"Hat came in great condition with no, issues quality looked good just wish we would make the hats in USA."
3,green bosox with red shamrock rear,"was hard to ascertain the actual size listed as small, medium, large.most hats are sized according to their circumference in inches. i chose a medium (little tight but wouldve been the best fit).i didnt know what 'garment washed' meant. it has kind of a 'broken in' feel. it seems [i]used[/i] but i guess that is the style they were going for."
3,not their best,The cartoons that are on this collection are good but certainly not the best chip and dale cartoons ever. many of my favorites were missing and I had only seen one of the cartoons on it before. I enjoyed it but am still looking for a comprehensive collection.
1,Faure Nocturnes,"I was very disappointed in this CD because it has some scratches on it. The CD was new and unopened so I was surprised to hear them. I am a music teacher and I need these quality new CD's to help improve my students playing. I did not find very many, except on the 3rd Nocturne. It came sealed and I paid for a new one. I did like the Pianists performance."
3,Good for early book,"Shay is an amazingly good writer (writers plural since it's a co-write team) and this early book, despite the obvious and corny romance cliches, is very well written. The sex scenes are steamy and realistic. Some of her other books, such as 'On The Line' are favorites of mine."
4,"Very Good, but....","What IS there, IS good- But, For the price, @ $45. to $55. I had hoped it was going to be much more in depth. More information on equipment; e.g.: Lenses, cameras, & accessories such as tripods, light meters, etc. I also would have liked much more information on films, printing paper, chemicals, processing techniques, etc. I suppose this does get away from the general title of the book somewhat, however, being new to the processing Large Format film, I needed much more information on that topic, as it is quite a bit different than working with roll film.What I did like about it is that it did give a very good overview of the View Camera; and has especially good section on the techniques for using one. Not sorry I bought it, just wished for it to be a bit more than it turned out to be."
1,Total waste of money,"At $78.73 this is the worst waste of money ever! Most of the information is basic how a camera works with very little on Large Format Photography. If you are starting to use a large format camera you will find, most of the information in this book you most likely already know. The pictures in this book look as if they were copied using an old copier from the 70s very dark and pixilated and hard to view. A book on photography, I would think, should have better images. This book looks as if someone printed it up in their basement. A much better buy would be ""The Camera"" by Ansel Adams. You can buy it used for $10 to $20; it has more information with better details on using large format with lot better images showing you how to use it. I was looking forward to it arriving. It came last night and I got the RMA 12 hours later; this is the first book I've ever returned! If I could I would give this book 0 stars."
3,Too Heavy,"I bought this bicycle lock for my brand new bike. I read about it in a magazine. My other very nice bicycle had recently been stolen so I was on a mission for the best lock possible for the new one. The problem with this lock it is WAY TOO HEAVY. It sucks that a lock has to be this heavy to be ""high security."" But once it arrived in the mail and I picked it up I couldn't imagine lugging it around with me. Anyway, product is great if you don't mind the weight and lugging it around!!!"
4,Willie's Good Songs,"If you like Willie Nelson's music, this CD is the one to get. Shipped immediately. Amazon is THE PLACE to buy CD's."
2,Beware - this DVD is awful quality!!!,Buyer should beware that the quality of this DVD is terrible. The sound is very muffled and the video is terrible with many jumps and gaps. It looks like someone taped it off of TV and then let the tape sit in the basement for 30 years. I can't emphasize enough how awful the quality of this DVD is.
2,VCI Product of This Movie Is Poor Quality!,"While the movie itself is very well done, the audio and video quality of this particular brand is awful, almost unwatchable. I had recorded this movie from tv with a cheap tape (recording over something else) and a VCR on its last leg and the quality was much better than this. I hope this movie is released on DVD in the future and digitally remastered. Don't waste your money on the VCI version of this movie."
1,It wouldn't play-Severely scratched!,"This was a product that was severely damaged to the point of not working. It was an inexpensive item, but still a waste of money. Most disappointing was the family had gotten hyped about watching it during the holidays and was left hunting something else to do."
3,Good movie,I forgot how good this movie is. I seen it avery long time ago. Couldn't believe thatreally happened. What a shame.
2,"5 for the Movie, 0 for the dvd quality","Talk about no effort. This is really a terrible transfer. It really looks like someone had an old vhs tape of this 2 part tv movie and they just recorded it as is onto dvd. From the first minute to the last, you are treated to a dark, scratchy, hissing and popping movie. This is a terrific film, with an all star cast. Such an interesting story wasted with an awful dvd. This is one I truly hope someone would put out the right way."
2,Jim Jones facts or creative endeavor?,"The style was good, compared to films that were made in the 80s and 70s. Powers Boothe is amazing and the rest of the cast was great especially Collen Dewhurst and James Earl Jones. I wished I hadn't learned what I had about the events because I might have enjoyed the movie more."
5,Boothe is spellbinding,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago on A&E. Since I'm a big fan of Boothe, I was thrilled to watch it. But I didn't expect to see so enthralled over the story. I watched helpless as his followers, in blind devotion, catered to his every whim and finally took their own lives. Boothe's performance definitely deserved him recieving the Emmy Award for Best Actor. He literally BECAME Jim Jones. Even though Jones was an evil man, you can't help being seduced by him. Guyana Tragedy was a heartbreaking movie to watch, particularly the suicide scene. It's not easy watching, but it gives you insight into the madness of one man and his followers"
1,"a nice, shiny piece of junk","this phone crashes all the time. it has trouble charging (it won't recognize the charge plug, even sometimes during a charge, so it won't actualy cahrge at all). i have a hard time making calls taht are not in my area code (t-mobile recognized this problem...and did nothing....go t-mobile). don't waste your money. buy motorola (sometimes those work) or nokia. sony makes the worst products, be it stereos, headphones, cd players or cell phones."
2,You pay for what you get,"I've had my phone for just about a year. When I initally bought it, I was excited at having a smaller phone, but realized this comes at a price. Let's just say it's the perfect size for the 18 month old I nanny. Everything on the phone is compact so if you are over 5 feet tall, you may find you need to adjust the phone when you are speaking and listening. The buttons are rather small and difficult to manuever if you don't have small fingers. The sound quality is so-so. It is lightweight (this is a plus). If you are looking to take pictures with the phone, the quality is grainy (typical of the first camera phones). After this phone, I've decided to go back to a flip phone because unless you remember to lock the keys you may find your phone dialing your contacts while it's in your purse or bag. After my year with my T610 phone, I'm looking forward to trading it in."
2,not good,"If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only."
1,Not Good,Phone hungs and key pad locks some times.... Phone has more functionality but Sony ericson should invest some more money in Testing the phones.Signal strength is also poor when compared to other phones.
3,Not that much talk time and standby time,"As in the title. I have around 4-5 hours of talk time (continuously) and around 7-8 days of standby time. Not sure how long other people can get. Other than that, it's a pretty cool phone."
2,Sony Ericsson T610 is not reliable,"I owned it for 2 months now. The first time I got the phone, it jammed on me. The key pads on the phone was not to responding. When I get an incoming call, I tried to accept the call by pressing the ""yes"" button, it didn't take it. I exchanged a new phone with T-mobile, the second phone worked for 1 week. After that, it jammed on me again. Sony Ericsson T610 is definitely not a reliable phone. If one has a emergency, that would be a disaster because the phone key locks all the time. I can't wait till my contract ends so I can get out of this horrible phone and service. Also, signal is terrible. It doesn't work in buildings at all."
3,Bad reception,Compared to the Nokia 3650 this phone has very poor reception.Most of my calls go to the voice mail when I'm in my department.but my friend who has a Nokia 3650 doesnt miss any call in the same building.(Both of us have the same T-mobile plan )
1,Worst phone of my life!,"I got this phone because it brought back (...)net in rebates into my pocket! ""How bad can a phone get"", I thought.Big big mistake!!!This phone hangs all the time, the java processor is slow as hell (so basically EVERYTHING on this phone has a long lag), the camera images are terrible, the menus are extremely non-intuitive and basically, nothing's easy!I've sworn off sony ericssons for life...Motorolas it will always be!"
3,ok phone but far from great,"i've had this phone for over a year now and can say something about it from real experience... it's a good little phone, but i'm having one major problem with it lately, and that it that the little joystick is becoming increasingly reluctant to move ""down"". i'm told this is because of dirt that's gotten inside, well - great! sometimes it is VERY difficult to actually move down on the screen, which, from time to time, one needs to! so that's not a very good thing. my other gripe is that the camera is really not very good at all. i did not buy this phone for an excellent camera, but this one barely hots the 'acceptable' mark. i'd keep that in mind."
3,"Great features, but bad manus designs and poor reception","this is the worst reception phone i ever had from T-mobile. There are many features in this phone, but poor manus designs, there are no Yes/NO buttons or Call/End buttons, so you have to use the back button, to go to the main menu."
4,Just OK in LA,I bailed on At&t for Tmobile and this phone. I work in Burbank Ca and the reception isn't as good as my freebie Nokia was but in the rest of the area it seems ok. What's up with the hard to find covers?
1,rather a review of Amazon delivery,"I ordered this phone from Amazon on Dec 12, and still havent received the phone (Jan 26). Amazon keeps delaying my order and their present shipping expectation is Feb 27.thanks amazonadarsh adarsh"
3,Unreliable T610,"This phone is a cool looking gadget. Light, very protable and the graphics are really nice. The only problem is that I have changed this phone twice and still has some glitches when dialing or during conversations. It will randomly shut off and sometimes it takes up to 20 minutes to turn back on. The reception is decent, depending on the plan you may have. I will definitely look for a better phone next time. In the mean time I will have to call customer service for the lack of signal I have within the T-Mobile area."
1,T-Mobile has poor coverage in CA,"The phone is ok - slightly poorer reception that other models but I believe that's due to the internal antenna.The T-Mobile coverage is really abysmal, however. If you are looking at this phone, buy it but get your service from AT&T.; At least in the 95129 zip code and surrounding areas you will get VASTLY better coverage."
3,"Just switched from Cingular, Columbia-Missouri","I just changed my carrier after I finished my contarct with Cingular. I had Nokia 3560 when with Cingular. Here are some of my experiences:Pros:Small PhoneCons:1) Practically useless camera2) Low Volume3) Always starts with a low volume when phone rings(even when the increasing ring option is set to 'off')4) I think the reception is kind of low to this phone (even T-mobile might have poor siganl). With my Cingular I always had an excellent signal whereever I go.5) When you are in deeper level menu, we cannot come to main menu in one step. SO suppose if you are in 4th level menu, you have to press 'back' 4 times to come back to main screen.6) Few ringtones with phone."
4,T610 Good Phone with Quirks,"I have a T610 with T-Mobile here in South Florida, The 1st phone I got had the Freeze for no reason problem 3x in 3 weeks. It also failed to charge on at least 1 occasion. I returned the phone and got another one and it has been great. Reception is hit and miss in building (good ole faraday effect). The camera is nice but all I use it for is a pic of my cat at this time. Sound quality is good on calls but the Increasing ring is annoying because it doesn't disable even when you set it to off. Screen quality is good but don't bother trying in direct sunlight. The only problem I have is finding a good game for the phone. Anybody know a good morphun game site for this phone? T-Mobile doesn't have any apps available."
4,Just Fine,"ProsSmall, very nice camera, voice calling feature, bluetooth capabilities.ConsScreen is nearly impossible to see in sunlight. Bluetooth can be quirky, failing to connect sometimes. Phone occassionally ""locks"" requiring you to take out the battery to reset it. Battery life is good."
4,One of the best from Tmobile!!,"This phone is certainly one of the best phones offered by Tmobile. Everything from its capabilities to its rf quality is very top notch. One great advantage this phone has over other Bluetooth enabled phones offered by Tmobile is the size as well as more user friendly menus.Pros:Relatively small and lightGreat menu setupFast moving menusBluetooth syncLoud ear pieceCons:Very high maintanence (smudges easily)No speakerphoneSome of the complaints about this phone have been on the issue of the RF being low. This was a major problem on early models which were made a while back and have recently been fixed by a new firmware. The phone actually shows RF fluctations more than other phones, resulting in people thinking it has bad RF.Overall this is a great purchase and is great phone. If someone were to be looking for more than JUST a phone, please look into the Nokia 3650, which is based on symbian OS and can have programs built for series60 be used on it."
2,Never getting another SonyEricsson phone again!!! T-mobile,"I got this phone from Amazon with the expectation of crash free usage. However after about 3 months of using it the phone started to act funny. It would randomly drop calls, randomly turn itself off, and randomly freeze due to just regular everday use! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is I can download wall papers to this phone otherwise I hate this phone with all my heart!!! I am going back to Nokia, at least I know I my phone will NOT turn off or restart in the middle of my conversation. I had gotten a replacement for this phone and the same thing is happening. This has got to be among the worst fully color phones out there. I'm calling them again to complain because it's garbage!"
5,The Elegant,"6 months ago I was looking for a light and camera phone.Since then I recomanded it to all my family members and friends.It is very light, pocket phone elegant with its double color dress, silver and black - I recommend it for a buisness use too.The bluetooth let me synchronize to my office computer in a sec.I upload pictures, data (calendar, appointments) voice notes etc...and you can hook it to your PDA or laptop for an internet connection. One word: WONDERFUL"
4,"A good phone, once you overcome it's problems","This is a really good phone. Easy menu operation, nice screen, good frame.The one problem I had, and reading the reviews I can see other poeple had, is that the phone freezes a lot. I had this happen twice on my first phone so I called t-mobile and they sent another. That phone froze on me as well. The entire phone locks up and there is nothing you can do to get it to work until... I DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM! The phone doesn't actually freeze, it's the buttons on the keypad that get stuck! If you have this happen, look closley at the keypad, you will see that a number ( mine was 7) on the keypad pushed in too far. Just flick it back out with a finger nail and the phone will work agian. It seems that if a key gets stuck, the phone won't be able to do anything until you pop it back up. Other than that it is a good phone."
2,"If you have more money, skip this one.","I used this phone for three weeks now , I am not very happyabout it.Pros:1. A lot of features. (BLUETooth, IRDA and so on.)2. Cheap( got it for $50 before rebate.)Cons:1. Very difficult to take SIM card out.2. The key pad is badly designed, sometimes the keys stuck under the face plate and cause the pone to froze.3. Menu is difficult to use .4. standby time is about 1/3 ( or less) what Sony Ericsson stated. Other phones I used before usually get 60%-70% of stand by time with light usage.5. Ring volumn is low. Vibrating(Ring) is not strong enough.6. The phone screen get dirty easily.7. Only 1 mb of memory avaliable (T-mobile).The reciption signal is ok for this phone. This phone looks cool , but the quality is poor. Spend a little more for a better phone. I will not recommand this phone."
1,Horrible reception - returned it after 1 week !,"Don't waste your time with this phone! I could never get decent reception on this phone, even though I was clearly in the coverage area. My wife also has T-mobile service, and gets great reception in the same locations. When I called T-Mobile, the representative confirmed (unofficially) that this phone has well-known reception problems. I'm returning this one to Amazon ASAP."
2,You Could do Better,"The reason I say you could do better is that both Sony as a manufacturer and you as a consumer could do better.The phone doesn't get as good of reception as most Nokia or Motorola phones (on At&t; or Tmobile) and protective cases are both needed to cover the easily scratched/smudged screen and virtually unavailable. Same with handsfree, other than the ill fitting piece that comes with it only a bluetooth set is available adding at least another $60 to your bill.Sony usually means superior quality, but my girlfriends Motorola V300 was free after rebate and I'm jealous of it's quality over mine."
1,Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile),Since 5 years I was using sprint phones with very easy and cool features. Recently I took Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile)and my problems started. I don't see one good feature. I don't know how people are surviving with T-mobile. I am thinking first time I took very bad decision with T-mobile. I'll strongly advise that don't buy T-mobile phones..
2,not ok,This phone is slow. The picture images are not clear. It can not store much pictures in memories. It is a small and cute phone but it has bad reception/keep on loosing signal.
4,Good Deal !!!,"The phone is pretty good.Very light weight.The display is good, it has several themes. Well...the camera is not that great! if you compare with motorola V600 or Nokia6600 but for me Camera is something good to have in a Mobile but not an essential feature.Battery life is incredible.Its a world phone ( Works in India :-) ).It has some PDA functionalities like organiser,calender,tasks list, reminders.Has Bluetooth, its pretty cool.Doesnt have many interesting games though!"
2,Very poor at Signal Reception,"Good:1) Connectivity options, connects via bluetooth, IR, and WAP.BAD:1) This phone is supposed to pick up what ever signal it gains, instead of telling me there is no network. I guess this phone comes with network lock and does't look for other carriers.2) My old phone used to pickup the signal strongly, but this one doesn't."
4,Sony T610 A good deal!,I got Sony T610 5 months ago and I am satisfied with its performance so far. Battery talk time is quite reasonable. Blue tooth feature is very helpful in connecting to the computer. There are very few games on this cell phone. Overall it is a good deal.
2,"cool features, but problems...","POSITIVES:SMALL SIZEBLUE TOOTHCOOL LOOKINGNEGATIVES:PHOTO QUALITY MAKES THE CAMERA USELESSRECEPTION IS MUCH, MUCH POORER THAN THE MOTOROLA V300 AND THE NOKIA 6610NOT VERY COMFORTABLE AGAINST THE EARNO SPEAKER PHONEFRONT SMUDGES EVERY TIME IT IS USEDBUTTONS ARE OF POOR QUALITYI RETURNED THE PHONE TO AMAZON BECAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS MENTIONED."
2,Poor reception,"Had this phone before switching to the Motorola V300. The reception on this one was extremely poor. Where my Moto shows 5 green bars now, the Ericsson would show a 2 or 3 amber bars. Initially, thought it was just T-Mobile coverage but that doesn't appear to be the case."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!,"I bought this phone about a month ago and kind of liked it for a while. Then I noticed a lot of problems. The phone's camera is not good at all. I wanted to take a picture and had to use a lot of lights so the picture would look kind of good. When the picture is taken it looks pixelated. I mean you can see it in little squares. The pictures also take a lot of time to be taken. You press the capture button and then on the screen appears the message: ""PLEASE WAIT"" and if you move the phone during that time, the picture will come out as a blur. The reception of this phone is really bad too. The service can come and be full and then suddenly disappear. I tried to listen to a message but I didn't hear anything clearly. The keyboard is also kind of difficult to use. To enter the menu you have to press the joystick right in the middle or it will go to another page. The phone is really slow and can get frozen sometimes. When changing themes it takes about a minute."
5,the bluetooth is awesome,"I haven't had this phone for very long, but I think it's so cool. It's small enough to fit anywhere and the color screen is great. The best thing though, is the bluetooth. It lets me sync my PDA and my phone so I don't have to constantly update my phone book in the phone. The bluetooth also lets me share pictures with friends if they have bluetooth. It's so great!"
3,"Not good, not bad","An average phone with some good features.What I like:- Bluetooth- Big screen- The cammera- Good menu system- Tri-band- GPRS, WAVWhat I don't like:- Java MIDP 1 (not MIDP2). You can't access the bluetooth or IRDA from Java- Screen quality is badBottom line: For the price I paid (about US$155) I think It's a good phone, but I would really like if sonyericsson makes a firmware upgrade for Java.Sorry for the bad English"
2,Bad Reception,"The reception on this phone, compared to the Samsung X105 is weak. My son has the X105 and I stood holding both at many lacations and his would showalmost all bars while mine, on many occasions would show 1 or none. Unfortunately, Samsung does not make a Bluetooth phone; with iSync on a Mac, Blue tooth is beautiully easy to sync your address book and calendar. I will dump the 610 as soon as Samsung make a Bluetooth"
1,Does Every thing else better other than CATCHING A SIGNAL,This is literally one of the worst piece of junk cell phone i ever owned . I am a big fan of Samsung and any low end samsung beats this phone clean. Whats the use of having Bluetooth and ir and a cam phone if it cant pic up a signal. I thought it was my serviece provider T-Mobile who had a problem but when i changed the sim to a nokia i got 3 bars and none on this piece of junk.
1,Don't by this phone.,"If the system let me rate this as a '0' I would. I have had 5 phones over 9 years. I worked for AT&T Wireless. This is by far the worst phone I have ever had. It turns it self off for no reason, dials 911 and leaves no trace of the call in the call log. It is impossible to read the screen outdoors. If you read a message (page) and leave the message reading screen up you will not get notified when you receive another message until you leave that screen. Auto key lock does not always work.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this phone."
5,"Is what it is, and more","fact is it's liable to have more features than you need. yes there are a few things that cell phone gui afficionados quible about, like the dark clock in sleep mode, but, don't you wear a watch, too? no matter, i found plenty of resources about this phone online such as Howards Forums, do a search for it. i recently dropped the phone in the kitchen sink while doing dishes (don't ask). I was PEEVED! I nearly spoiled my pants i was so angry. it looked like a little pocket-sized aquarium with no light... so i laid it out on the patio in the sun for a few, then the next day i lit it up and it worked, though the lcd screen was tweeked. so i went on ebay and bought a ""sony-ericsson t610 lcd screen"" for $31 and installed it with photo directions on the forum and a Torx-6 screwdriver. Up and running again, connected to my Apple with a USB-Bluetooth adapter, and i kid you not, i'm not going back.... good choice."
1,"bab reception, not clear picture, freeze","it looks great, but ... just don't buy it ..it's not worth it, with all the trouble u'll have later.A piece of chunk"
2,Not 'The Scorcerer'...,"I searched for the G&S production of 'The Scorcere'. This one said 'The Scorcer' and 'Cox and Box', but the total runtime is only 39 minutes, and it looks like it starts with 'Cox and Box', so I can't see how it contains 'The Sorcerer' at all!"
3,Good looking but it get overcrowded inside.,"This is a very nice case overall, but it does tend to get crowded once you put a full size graphics card in it. A couple of inches in hieght or depth would have helped. Once a fan is installed in the front of the chasis the hard drive also needs to moves lower and then it gets very crammed."
3,Early extrapolation,This early expansion sadly lacks dialogue and lays heavy on story-telling. Keep in mind this is an early piece of work. I would like to see more of this Author to truly understand her style.In years after this the fandom was gifted with Conzines that bestowed a wider view of this era of Vincent and Catherine's early relationship
5,Extraordinary Beauty in the void,"Here is human motivation, hope and loss reduce to essences: small repeated gestures echoed in a repetitive language of intense poignance and beauty."
3,"Very VERY comprehensive, almost too much","This is a very good book to read for Michigan history, starting with the very beginning to the new millennium. However, this book is too comprehensive for a college MI history class, which is what I had to read. I would have preferred pictures, yes I like pictures, of the history. Also, the lack of commas drove me nuts because the authors did not use them when they should have. I think the book could be reedited in a better way.All in all, if I had to say, the book is gives a great idea of MI, but it's so. freaking. comprehensive. The authors give percentages on pretty much every topic."
4,Shoes.,I like the shoes and buy them because of this reason. I still feel the pricing of Adidas clothes and shoes out of line.
5,The Brothers Stretch Out On Their Home Turf,"Yes, I'm a self-admitted Allman Fanatic. Having seen the Brothers several times during the Duane Allman/Berry Oakley era, I can attest to their unparaelled ensamble playing. Here the ABB's stretch out, relaxed on their home turf and turn in soaring renditions of Statesboreo Blues, Stormy Monday, Elizabeth Reed and of course Whipping Post and Mountain Jam.This must have been one hell of a festival to attend. Perhaps Columbia will re-release the orginal album in an expanded format and include performances by the likes of Mountain, Procol Harum, Johnny Winter, Ten Years After and Miles Davis. In the meantime I'm loving this great Allman treasure."
3,Allmans Live in Atlanta,"Cd has some very good songs, which don't appear on Live at the Fillmore, but the sound quality is not great and the songs are musically more well developed & polished on the Fillmore album."
4,Mostly quite nice.,"At my advanced age, it's awfully hard NOT to hear echos of Crosby, Stills and Nash in Thorns' debut. It's even harder not to hear echos of America circa ""A Horse With No Name"" and I leave it to you to decide for yourself whether or not that's a compliment. Nonetheless, Matthew Sweet, Shawn Mullins, and Pete Droge playing and singing together have made a honey of an album that has a lot going for it. People's favorites are going to vary considerably; mine are ""No Blue Sky,"" ""Dragonfly,"" ""I Can't Remember"" and ""I Set The World On Fire."" I don't really care if the album's possibly too derivative of the aforementioned bands. There's very little of this type of thing anymore, and Thorns do a good job of it, so bring it on, sez I!"
4,Awesome,I have a hard time putting this book down once I start reading and I think you will too. Excellent book by a very good author.
1,don't bother,Unfortunately these are a great idea for cold feet but they don't work. The warming beads are in the sole and they move around and are very lumpy so you can't walk in the boots and in bed they shift around and the boot doesn't stay in place and if you have to get out of bed you have to take them off you can't walk in them. A great idea but not quite workable. And costly at that.
1,"Bad scholarship, no linguistics","Reg Hindley's book has the appearance of solid scholarship with lots of statistics. However, he is a geographer, not a sociolinguist, and thus many of his conclusions are frankly question-begging. He seems to be pre-convinced that the language is dead, and writes accordingly. Although exaggerated optimism about the future of the language is definitely not justified either, Hindley's is no objective approach either. There are direct lies, such as the reference to the disintegration of the Ráth Cairn Irish-speaking colony, which is still going strong, having even a web page in Irish. Hindley has confused Ráth Cairn with the Baile Ghib colony, which did disintegrate all right."
2,ahh...ummm...no.,"I tried to appreciate this CD. I really did. And maybe I'm missing something or I'll come to understand these songs a little more but the quality and content of KOYMS is only interesting if taken as a demo or scratch ideas. Everything I know about music came into play as the tracks first played through. ""It needs real drums here, the vocals could be more distinct here. Harmonies would be special here. The right producer really would know what to do."" The Kills 'finished' songs like What New York used to be and Black Balloon are real works of art, completed masterpeices, if you will, still able to be filed under the post-punk, stripped down, or garage labels if desired.Well...Hmmm...maybe one more listen."
5,The Beginning,"The only complaint is that this book isn't longer. This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories. Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started. Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy. For the money, this one was perfect for me."
4,Great movie.. really makes a person think about fairness,This movie makes a person think about fairness and equality for all.. and for the gay community just proves we still have a long road ahead of us!!!
1,Horrible Book,This book is not helpful. It does not provide enough information about anything other than Disney World. We did not even take it on our trip.
2,5x Mirror,Mirror fell off the backing during the first week. Can still use it but afraid it will fall apart and break withuse.
1,Help I can't see!,Very poor quality. Distortion is so bad I could not use the mirror and returned it.
1,Fell down and shattered on the FIRST DAY!,"Do not buy these, I bought 2 and used the suction cups to put them on 2 showers. By the time I got home a few hours later they both fell off the shower tile and the glass was shattered all over both of my shower floors."
5,Blackberry Leather Holster,Great product. Just like original. I am very satisfied with both the quick delivery and the quality of the holster.
1,too small,"Though the case says it is for the 8800 series, the case is actually too tight. When you put the blackberry in, it goes on because of the tightness. I purchased one from directly from Blackberry (though it was triple the price) and it fit well."
5,Oh happy day!,"I lost my orig holster and as you know, only BB holsters offer the ability to turn the phones off when you put the phone in them. Well, at least, that's what I have been told. At any rate, THIS IS THE ORIG HOLSTER!!! It's the exact same holster that came with the phone. It has a swivel clip that allows you to lock the phone into several different positions. Unlike clips of of the past where the phone would freely swing.If you need a replacement or merely want and 2nd one as a back up, do yourself a favor and order this holster!!!"
1,Clip Breaks but they're Cheap,"Purchased 3 of the cases, knowing that the clips break easily. Disappointed that shipping from MyNetDeals is a ripoff. 3 holsters in one bubblewrap package sent via first class mail, but was charged postage costing more than the holsters themselves. What a ripoff. If they paid $2 in shipping I'm surprised. Clips break easily, but for $4 you get what you pay for."
2,My third one in a year,"I get in and out of cars and planes a lot and broken clips are the fate I must live with. Taking it off the belt when sitting down seems to be the method to keep the clip from breaking when I remember to do this. I ordered a rubber case along with this new one so I can chose a pocket carry option. Clipping the thing to my briefcase seems to work for getting in and out of the car. Like the others I agree the clip is junk, but it is plastic so I can't expect it to take my 6 foot frame bending the thing over when I'm getting in a car."
1,Irregular case,"Original case that was ordered on March 24, 2011 was not the correct size; thus my phone could not fit in the holster and the magnetic flap that holds phone in place was distorted and would not fasten properly. I sent that case back, then the second case that was sent to me from this company looked like the same exact case that they sent to me the first time and then to boot the clip that holds case to belt broke only after a couple uses.I then expressed to the company that maybe they may have a quality control issue with their supplier. Only because I have order several of these type of case from amazon and never had a problem, never! Until now with this company.Also after not being satisfied with my purchase for a second time I request a refund on April 28, 2011 from and order that was placed on April 20, 2011 and I have yet to receive one.Disgruntled Customer"
4,Exact Replacement for OEM Holster...Almost,"For those of you who like the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) holster for your Blackberry 8830, this item, which I purchased last week from A1 Accessories, is a very close replacement. The only difference I found was the the little silver emblem that says ""Blackberry"" was removed from the item before it shipped, presumably to avoid a Trademark dispute with RIM. If you have your original case, you can just pop the silver emblem off the old one and glue it onto the new one. Good as new!"
5,awesome,this gun is awesome! it says 320 fps but with .12 bbs it has 400 fps. it says not to use them but i did and it works fine. i highly recomend this gun. the only drawback isthats right nothing
1,Pretty Bad,"I dont like to be the person who writes the one bad review in the middle of all these good ones, but this gun was bad. The shooting rate changer scratches your gun, the battery is hard to get in, and the clip rate is really skippy and horrible. After i shot about 20-30 shots,which didn't shoot consecutively, the gun made an annoying noise and broke on me."
5,Every song is great,"I was lucky enough to be turned on to Frampton's music before FCA came out and this was my favorite studio effort. There's a bit of anger in his voice on some tracks and his guitar playing is multi-layered and excellent. Golden Goose, Magic Moon, and Underhand 3 of my favorite Frampton songs of all time and the rhythm section here is probably the best he ever had, very tight and funky. Nice keyboard work too. Very musical and energetic effort."
3,Not Diane Reeves,"I was sent a review comparing this singer to Diane Reeves and there is no comparison. While Kontomanou has a good voice, her music style is very standard. I didn't really care for this cd."
5,A GREAT STORY FILLED WITH TWISTS AND TURNS.,What a wonderful story. It has so many twists and turns and is full of adventure. I couldn't put it down once I started it. It's a story you hate to see come to a close. I am looking forward to the next book in the series. IT'S GREAT! Great work Diane.
3,doesn't fit all double dins!!,We purchased this for a 7 inch screen double din stereo/dvd player and we tried 2 different stereos and both were too big!! We ended up having to dremel the bottom to fit the screen but you can't tell because the screen sticks out farther than the kit!
2,Not the best for 2006 F-150 Lariat,"I blindly ordered one of these for my 2006 F-150 Lariat to mount a Pioneer AVH-3200BT. The gap around this bezel and the factory cover plate was too large. I wound up ordering a 'Metra 95-5812 Double DIN Installation Kit for Select 2004-2006 Ford Vehicles (Black)' instead. The end result is a factory installed appearance. Close Scosche, but no cigar."
3,Alarming.......,"I bought this watch for my blind mother 2 years ago. She is always pushing the wrong button and turning the alarm on by mistake. It crows like a rooster and goes off at the strangest times. I finally set the alarm to her dinner time, so it won't go off in church or the middle of the night. After 2 years the face of the watch stopped working - not a big deal since she can't see it anyway. The watch still talks and says the correct time. It has been an okay watch but it would be nice if there were some way to disable the alarm. Five buttons are too many for some seniors."
3,Interesting tale--but too graphic,"This is an interesting tale--I read through it slow and steady, never really that excited about it but a little curious. I actually bought the less clean version than the rest of the book club--which was embarressing! So be careful which one you get. This version is very, very sexual and graphic--which is just not needed because the story line itself is good."
2,Author has a Very Limited Vocabulary,"I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe because I finished reading Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles just before reading ""Sarah"". The comparison between these two historical fiction writers is night and day. Dunnett is truly a historical writer. Halter is not. Halter has a finite list of words he (she?) employs, whilst Dunnett's is limitless and far more entertaining.I feel the author didn't develop the characters well (I couldn't ever really like Sarah and the author never adequately explained to my why Abraham loved her), paint a vivid historical picture for me or accomplish much with this story.Halter does not give the reader a good time frame. He uses phrases like ""some time later"". But does that mean some years, seasons, months, weeks, days, or hours? It bothered me that I could not tell what kind of time lapse was occuring.Don't bother spending your money on this book. It's not worth it. Check it out at the library if you feel you must read it."
2,Okay,"Very strong start, interesting idea. But the love interest was silly, the sex too graphic, the stupidity of the police/FBI unbelievable, and ultimately the story itself is disappointing. It was as if he created a great bad guy but didn't have a real reason for him to do what he did. Finder should have worked on the plot more, and left out a lot of the See How Much I Know? and See Where I've Been? information. He overdescribes almost everything. He's a good writer who needs more discipline."
5,Incredible! A thrill ride that'll put you in knots!,"This is the first of Finder's novels I've read and I must say, I'm hooked! Finder's writing style is incredibly intense and he uses factual knowlage to add the realistic power to it. The book grabs you and holds you till the end. Only one weak point: the end. Slips just a little and the climax happens altogether too fast. All in all, definately a 5-star...READ IT!"
3,TOO MANY SHADOWS,"""Shadowland"" is two stories in one book. The first is set in a strict prep school, the second is set in the confined house of a madman. Though this book had strong imagery and allegory, I found the story to be too complex. Straub tried to tackle too many issues at once and just barely scraped by. The characters are developed well, but I was unable to grasp the emotion of the love between Tom and the mysterious ""Rose."" If you'd like to read a book with a well-written love affair that is also black with horror I recommend reading ""Wizard and Glass"" by Stephen King. Overall, I found Shadowland to be too long, and the ending is unsatisfying and abrupt."
3,Another suspenseful and interesting but disappointing effort,"Peter Straub always has some interesting ideas but I don't think he handles them all that well! Others disagree... This novel about a couple of schoolboys who discover the secret of the heir to a lineage of wizardry has good suspense and some haunting moments, but the ending is VERY disappointing. This would actually have been a better novel WITHOUT the magical aspect, which is largely irrelevant! The brutalized-by-WWI explanation is a bit weak too, IMHO."
3,"""While You Were Sleeping"" -- The Hindi Version","OK I haven't actually seen this film yet, and will do a real review after I do. But from the synopsis, this film is apparently a complete plot remake of ""While You Were Sleeping,"" a fabulous romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. It's going to be tough to beat the original. Salman Khan's not my favorite actor but I like Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta so I'm giving this 3 stars on approval. :)Here's my question: did the producer clear the rights with the copyright holder of ""While You Were Sleeping""?"
1,grainy but solid (supposedly the best you can get for your hp),"so, this is the best alternative for my hp photosmartD5160 printer (or so hp says). it allows my hp printer to print solid colors only on their cds. for whatever reason, maybe proprietary disc sales, my hp printer may print many lighter color lines through large blocks of solid color if it uses any other inkjet cd. the hp disc itself has a grainy nature to its printed out cds.hp has poor print quality on their cds. if i could go back, i'd buy a different printer that allows better quality prints on ANY inkjet cd. this is so frustrating. hp is making their consumer buy their product that will only print using their cds which gives crappy results. i used to like hp inkjets."
4,What a beautiful book!,"This book is worth it for the illustrations. It is lovely to look at and fascinates my children. The interactive flaps are engrossing for the baby and actually help keep his interest for the entire read. The story is sweet, too. I look forward to reading this with my kids for many years to come."
1,F. E Peters needs to do his homework,"This book has alot to give which other traditional haj books lacks. But the Author has included his own opinions on the Muhammaden Ideology without substantiating from any authentic traditional sources. Though the flow and the tone of the book captivates the reader, the book is a total disgrace to any Muslim reader."
5,Great fit,"I purchased a pair of these shoes locally in brown and they fit so well I went looking for them in black. I have a narrow heel and have trouble with slip-on shoes, but these fit well throughout."
5,Excellent piece,"What a great piece. My only issue is it doesnt come with a lanyard; the ad doesn't say that it does, but it doesn't say that it doesn't either.the knife isn't the sharpest, but the title of the knife ""Guardian Back Up"" denotes that its used for personal defense. Do I have any doubts that it wouldn't defend me nobly? Not one. Great durable blade, sharp enough, excellent handle, amazing sheath. The sheath comes w/ a boot clip and you can either wear the blade facing up or facing down.The sheath is adjustable so if you are wearing the knife on your belt, you can loosen the forces holding the blade in. On the opposite, if you wear the knife upside down or on your neck you can tighten the sheath to make it tougher to pull the knife out of and decrease the chances of it falling out.Love the knife."
4,"Creative, but too unrealistic","Traps described in this books are much more interesting than standard ones, but absolutely unrealistic. Can you believe that somebody will use a teleporter for... throwing a victim some yards up, in order to drop him on the spike? If I'll make a teleporter trap, it will be MUCH more effective.But if your players are not interested in realism of your D&D; world - this book will be excellent for you. Game mechanics described in it is very interesting."
5,J Simpson Red Bacton pump,"The shoes were for my daughter who attends college in Kentucky. She had seen them in stores but they never had her size. I found them in her size, color, and at a better price on your web site. We were very surprised when the shoes arrived in just a couple of days since we did extended shipping to save cost. My daughter received the shoes at her address in Kentucky before she left for a trip, I had ordered them from home in Ohio! We are extremely pleased with our purchase. THANK YOU!"
1,Don't buy this product !,"I've had this $300 oven for no more than 4 years and the temperature was up and down. It is cooking unevenly and the temp is way off from what I set the dial to. I brought it to an authorized Waring repair shop who told me that he could not get me the part I needed (after telling me he could get parts and took $16 non refundable to test the oven). According to the Warning website, it is a discontinued product !! Don't buy. I won't buy Waring products anymore - $300 for an oven that lasted 4 years and now I can't repair it."
1,I can't believe she published this with all the errors,"This book is filled with typos. Did she even proof-read her own book before publishing? She says she went to college....Did someone not tell her in all her years of education that when you end one sentence with a question mark that you should begin the next sentence with a capitol letter? DUH!!! That among missing words and using he instead of his made me wonder...WHAT COLLEGE DID SHE GO TO???? And the ending was just stupid. Why did we need to know all of Joseph the cab drivers life history? Toschia, you need to get it together girl. You should be embarrassed. I hope you get it together before your next book."
3,So Naive !!!!!,This book was ok! Although I felt that the main character Rhea was really naive to have put up with some of the things that happened to her in this book! Good read but I would have rather gotten it from the library!
2,Did I read the same book everyone else read?,"After going by the recommindations of the reviewers for this book, I immediatly read it soon as I opened the Amazon package. Man, was I let down. The book had a wonderful plot which I am sure many sistahs have been through, but it was turned into a jumbled mess that was hard to follow. One minute, a baby momma is telling her crazy stuff with her man and in the next page she is sleeping with him and cooking for his family. What is up with that? And what happened to the editor for this book? The typos ran rampant all over this book! The ending, however, will have me purchase the sequel for this book. I just hope that rough edging in the first book will be smooth in the second."
4,not quite the same league as afi,"where do i begin in reviewing this album. first of all i would like to say these guys are good, but thats it, just good. alot of their songs carry very heavy chords and alot of screaming, which is good, if you like that kind of thing. the influence from afi is there which is one of the best things going for the band. i recommend this cd strongly, it make take some to get use to, but you'd be missing out if you didn't listen."
1,Yuck - Shallow & Obnoxious Protagonist,"Save your money and time for 2 reasons:1 - The protagonist is a whinny, shallow, stupid, lying, cheating woman who is very difficult to identify with. I felt like slapping her to her senses at many points through the book.2 - Some truly unrealistic events. (Alligators eating three people at once when a ship sinks? Alligators don't live in deep water and ships don't go in the swamps, not to mention that alligators don't eat people - duh.)"
1,It was awful,"I bought this book thinking I would be reading another Nanny Diaries (which I loved). This book doesn't even deserve to be in the same room with the Nanny Diaries! It was fake, forced, and completely unenjoyable. The dialogue was overdone. It was inconsistent and contradicted itself many times. Most of the characters were completely one-dimensional and/or not credible. Doesn't Faith Lord have better things to do than focus entirely on Ivy's life and cater to her every whim? And Ivy is such a pushover, it made me sick when she couldn't confront a single person of the many who have wronged her.I couldn't do it! I forced myself to read about half-way in hopes it would get better, and then I had to give up. And I never quit books! I can't rememeber the last time I didn't finish a book, I love reading so much.As Italians say, there is no worse thief than a bad book. I feel robbed!"
1,A Trite Tale Not Worth Your Time,"If you liked books likeThe Devil Wears Prada,The Nanny Diaries: A NovelorThe Right Address: A Novel, don't bother to read this book; you'll be disappointed. The Ivy Chronicles book is filled with Manhattan cliches and stereotypes. While I am well aware that the business of getting one's child into a private school can be cut-throat, Ivy Ames of The Ivy Chronicles is a terrible advisor thrust into the business of admissions counselor by a string of improbable events. I found none of the characters particularly interesting or compelling and the story was often wooden and forced. Watch a reality television show or something on the Lifetime channel rather than read this book."
3,Lightweight Read,"This book was about Ivy who looses her job and husband in the same day. She then starts her own business as a kindergarten consultant, helping wealthy people get their kids into a good kindergarten shool. The book is over the top and thus I laughed in parts. Ivy makes some immoral choices but they are realistic (most people in her situation would do the same things)."
3,not enough support,"I have had this product for about 1 yr and of course you are bound to have to wash it right. well, i washed it the black rubber on top started to ripple causing my smoothing spatula to jump and put marks in my surface.When I would raise the spatula so i would miss the ripple and i would miss part of the smoothing. Also the top would lean and then the cake looks uneven when your working on it. I don't mean the the tilting action when i say this. Now i am off to spend another 70.00 on a better quality turn table. I will say that i might use this one again after i glue the rubber back on. Just so i can use the tilting action."
5,Laura Canales...30 Hits,"May God have Ms Canales in His Heavens. The CD is a great memory for Tejano Music, and like Gold for Hispanic/Latino Baby Boomers. This is the music we grew up with. Her hits, including Si Vivi Contigo, is wonderful. Am glad I bought this CD...takes me back to my early years...am 70 now. Take care...someday you will be ""old"" too."
4,Frustrating but fun,"This is great fun if you have 2 people to put it together. The 5-year-old had a very hard time building tall ones because it falls over easily. They do still pull it out of the closet to play with it, so I call it a success."
2,Annoying,"There are a few issues with this set that make others more worthwhile (for reference, my kids are 6 and 7):1. When you add a shoot/funnel/anything other than the one-piece cylinder building pieces, you have to add 2 more clear pieces. Other sets would have a single piece that can be built upon. This doesn't, and you have a lot more work building as a result.2. The structure tends to be less than sturdy (not quite flimsy, but not as solid as other similar toys).3. The yellow spirals have a poor design. You have to add in small support pieces that don't snap into place. I believe this is so the spirals would take less space when in a box (they flatten out), but there are extra pieces you have to keep track of as a result. Not a fan.Overall, I'd suggest buying a different set."
2,Cheap and frustrating,"What a disappointment. Everything about this marble run is cheap. We've assembled three of the tracks on the box so far, and none of them work like they're supposed to. The inclines aren't right, so the marbles end up getting stuck. The yellow corkscrew pieces in particular are an issue - they've got connector pieces that are supposed to hold them together, but they're so cheap that they just keep snapping apart. The quality of the plastic feels worse than a toy you'd get at McDonald's. Buy something else."
2,Not sturdy enough for kids,"This is very hard to build -- like, multiple adults squinting at the picture on the box and cursing under their breath hard. You seem to have to build what is on the box -- we have not succeeded in varying from the picture much at all -- and even then it tends to lean, tilt, fall over... The whole thing is extremely light weight and unstable (even the ""marbles"" are tiny, lightweight plastic balls). I would definitely recommend against this marble run. We are back in the market for another one this year, because my kids still want to be able to play with one! We will be looking for one with more flexibility (i.e. it's easy for kids to be creative in how they build it) and sturdier/heavier-weight parts and bases."
1,Buy the Galt Marble Run instead,"We have this brand as well as the Galt brand marble run. We hardly ever use this set and the two are incompatible - I'm about the throw this one away and get more of the Galt brand. This marble run set is flimsy (our 2 year old can do the Galt by himself but needs our help for this one). This one also requires special smaller marbles - which we can never find! And the marbles sometimes need ""help"" getting all the way through the course (due to the flimsy construction). Don't waste your money - get the Galt brand instead:Galt Marble Run. LEAD FREE."
1,Skip this version of Marble Run and get a better one.,"Skip this Marble Run and get the one made by Discovery Toys - I wish I had! We have spent hours playing with Discovery Toy's version at Grandma's house - it is so much better. I'm so surprised because I thought Quercetti was such a good quality brand. This marble run is terrible. It is flimsy beyond belief. No matter how long I spend to get it upright and working (admonishing my excited children to STAY BACK! Don't touch it til I get it ready!!), it only takes a few seconds of play time for it to get knocked over again. The supports are too light.Thumbs down. Big disappointment."
5,Great Great Music,"This CD is NOTHING like hatebreed not even the same type of music or singing that guy who said that doesn't know what hes talking about. I have been listeing to all out war for years and this is thier best work yet heavier and better produced then earlier releases, the vocals are more brutal and the guitar players and drummers are tight. I listen to tons of New England local and underground music like caliban, killswitch, blood has been shed, katalakysm, katatonia, all shall perish just to name a few if you like bands like that you will love all out war one of the best releases this year."
5,One of the top debut albums of all time,"Raw,gritty,dirty,loud!I love it!This rates right up there with Van Halen's debut.The songs are straight-forward,in your face rock n' roll.'Nuf said!BUY it!And you will come to cherish it!(Is that cool to say,in rock...cherish?)."
4,PUNK-POP CLASSIC,"most people think of motley crue as a brain-dead ""hair band"" form the 80s - a disposable rock n'roll cliche. most people would be wrong, and too fast for love is evidence enough. owing more to cheap trick and the sex pistols than kiss OR zeppelin, this album is dripping with teenage angst and attitude ten years before nevermind. ""live wire"" is a classic in every sense of the word. other standout tracks include ""public enemy #1"" and ""on with the show"" - but there isn't a filler to be found on the whole record. as raw sounding as it gets, this may well be motley's finest hour. and if you can't dig this album, you can't dig rock n'roll..."
1,Inferior,"This is the 2nd ice maker I bought from COMPACT APPLIANCE. The first one lasted about 2 years using it everyday. I was very happy with it so I bought a different brand. This one has never worked. All I get is a chemical taste and smell from the ice. I cannot use the ice cubes in anything with out the taste and smell.I wrote COMPACT APPLIANCE and they don't even have the courtesy to respond. That was over 2 weeks ago. I explained to them that I am mostly homebound andam not able to take this to be boxed up and returned. I just want to know what to do about this situation.I know things happe....but, this was no vault of my mine and I believe the ice maker is defective.If you can help me with this problem I would greatly appreciate it. This is thefirst time I have had problems of this nature with anything I have ordered from Amazon.com. With the exception of a couple of things lost in transit.Your co-operation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.Marcia Perguidi"
4,Ice pack in less than 5 minutes,The ice cube maker delivers ice cubes for the creation of ice packs in school nursing stations in a matter of minutes. No more expensive chemical packs. Compact appliance that all school nurses will appreciate.
4,Great,"We have been very please with our ice maker! It took several (more an the recommended one cycle) cycles of making if before t stopped having a machine taste but now it's good! Satisfied, would buy again"
2,Countertop Ice Maker,"We ordered the ice maker for our RV. Be aware you need to add 5"" to the dimensions to allow for air circulation. It took three days of vinegar and lemon juice to get the plastic smell out of the ice. The unit will display ice full when it has one ice cube sitting on the full sensor. if you want to use it and have limited space, this is not the best choice..."
2,quit working,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my fiancee. It is only 30 days later and already it quit working. ;-(
1,hate it,bought 2 for Christmas presents and hate both of them. Way to complicated to use...my daughter hates it also which makes it just great since it was a gift...by the time she gets to the music she downloaded she is so aggravated she doesn't want to play with it.
2,Great Idea - Bad Product,I was looking forward to owning this item. Big hard shell bag was too cumbersome for trunk and travel. Major disappointment when product arrived. Locks are terrible. You cannot have any confidence using this bag. I will consider it in the future if they improve the locks.
5,A Wonderful Surprise!,"My daughter got a copy for her birthday and wasn't that intrigued, maybe because of the cover picture. But the story was absolutely wonderful andhaving been to NYC made it even more special. We just bought a copy to givea younger friend because we loved it so much. It is a wonderful tribute to the imagination and wonder in the simplest of lives. Very special for adults and children alike!"
1,No action,"Based on all of the positive reviews, I was prepared to like this book. I really tried (and I did read the whole thing to my daughter), but the only word I can use is . . . boring. Nothing really happened. This was a big disappointment."
3,"Should be subtitled ""Kids with ADHD""",I can see how this book could be very helpful to parentsof kids with ADHD. The sections on advocating for yourchild are also bound to be useful to many parents. Butthis book isn't much help to parents of non-ADHD kids.
5,Susana - one of a kind,"I'm not sure what happened to the previous reviewer. My copy of this album (two CDs) sounds great - several of the songs are live recordings, and Susana's voice is up front and clear. Her interpretations and orchestrations are not always the ""classic tango"" type. I know tango ""conocedores"" who dismiss her as a pop artist.But that's way too easy - this woman delivers passion and romance with a voice that's both powerful and intimate. I'll just not listen to the few I don't like and enjoy tremendously the rest, which she does as well or better than her peers. My suggestion? If you're new to the tango genre, go with someone safer and more traditional. If you're already a fan of tango and can tell Adriana Varela from Maria Graña, buy this album."
5,I am sure this plague is alive and well:,"So, we might as well be informed to avoid the horrible toll it caused the first time"
5,Great Arm Band,"This Arm Band Is Very Well Made Stays In Place, Fits My Ipod Nano Very Well, That Is Why I Gave It Five Stars"
3,Decent,"I got my product sooner than it was suppose to get to me (by two days) and its a nice, sturdy armband but thats about the only good things I can say. I own an 80GB iPod and it has a hard time fitting and I was under the impression that it had a cord holder; which it doesn't."
4,"Good unit, could be better","The extra memory card reading feature is nice, but too slow to be very useful. It takes a full 5 seconds to read a 3.1 Megabit picture, so slide shows are a little slow. It plays DVD's just fine, and VHS tapes too. Owned it for 3 months and no problems so far. Only sticking point is the pause on VHS is a little jittery on tapes recorded on it, but halfway distorted on tapes from another (cheaper) player. DVD is crystal clear and all the functions are good. Remote is pretty intuitive, except for the DVD fast fwd, which goes to 'search' mode to the next scene if you let off too fast. It is nice to have the integrated TV functions, so you can control volume even in DVD or VHS mode."
1,Samsung DOES NOT CARE.,"This unit was a piece of junk. The DVD player quit reading DVDs only a couple months after purchase. I contacted Samsung and they said all you have to do is pay for shipping of the unit to SASCOA, E. Providence R.I. (my nearest repair center)and they will repair the unit and ship it back. There the unit sits. They don't pay for return shipping - you do (they didn't even tell me it was repaired - but they did tell me when I called that ""Wow, I'm surprised they haven't sold it on you, they're authorized to do that if it sits for more than two weeks"". Samsung didn't care who told me that I only had to pay for one way shipping, SASCOA is very unprofessional and they pretty much told me they don't care about the consumer, they work for Samsung. I will never buy a Samsung product again, no matter what the reviews. Customer service is poor at best. They only want your money, not your return for more products."
4,Remote control power button won't work,"We had initially purchased an open-box Samsung (different model) from BestBuy - but the power button on the remote wouldn't turn the unit on or off. So I returned the unit to BestBuy and purchased this unit online.Very pleased with the performance - remote control layout is not that intuitive, and, guess what - after a few months, the power button has stopped working on this unit, too. Don't know if it's the remote not working, or the unit refusing to recognize the power on/off commands, but now I find myself being lazy and leaving the DVD player turned on, which I'm sure won't be great for the lifetime of the unit.Otherwise, pretty pleased with it."
2,Two Out of Three Ain't Bad But It Ain't Good,"I purchased three of these several months ago. Two of them work fine. They're inexpensive units, & reasonably easy to use. They're no frills machines, but worth the money. The third unit has stopped recognizing many major studio released DVDs that the other two units play. With the third unit, I have to load & reload, jiggle the DVD in the holder, & turn the power off & on, to get it to sometimes work. After 15 minutes of fiddling with it, I usually give up & move on to something else. I'll soon be getting rid of the third unit because it's aggravating & wasting my time. The two units that work get a rating of 3* from me, & the other one gets a 1* rating. My next DVD/VCR combo will probably be a Panasonic."
4,Celtic music for Celtic music lovers.,"If you think you like Celtic music, this is the test to determine if this musical style is for you. This is the music they played way back when, and as such should be considered foreign music. It is rough and has none of the trappings of modern ""Celtic"" music. If you thought the wedding celebration music in ""Braveheart"" was the greatest music in the world, you'll probably love this. Otherwise, put on Clannad, light some incense, and enjoy feeling worldly."
5,Extremely satisfying,"Exhaustive, meticulous and worth every penny of its relatively steep price, this book contains everything you need to know about Pancake, and provides an ideal, even crucial supplement to the author's lamentably small body of published work."
4,good stuff,"The quality and value are definitely good. I would like to have an assortment which does not include the classic ""honey and oats"" flavor. These are readily available."
2,A bit misleading,FYI: There are only 12 packages of two bars each in each box. You can find a better deal on amazon.
1,Doesn't hold,"This product doesn't hold near as well as the stuff you can buy for half the price at the drug store. It smells like alcohol and burns your eyes until it's dry, and the brush gets all bent up after one or two uses. Great idea, but not a good product at all."
2,eh ... so so book.,"I bought this because of a sudden fascination with the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, on this the 80th anniversary of Hitler's rise to power. But the book was written in a way that made it hard at times to follow along. I would not recommend it."
2,Disappointing!!!,"Maeve Binchy has so many wonderful novels, don't waste your time reading this one. It is really awful."
