1,Item description is incorrect.,"The item description lists drivers are available for Windows 98/98SE systems. In actuallity, the flash drive will not work with Windows 98 and no driver is available. E-mails to the help line were not returned. Poor description and NO service."
2,Not nearly good enough for Jenna's talents!,"This is a truly bad movie, and only rates two stars because Jenna Elfman is, admittedly, adorable. The characters are one-dimensional, the medical events completely implausible, and the action painfully slow. I hope I am not disclosing too much by stating that those who remember ""ET"" will find themselves wondering if there are grounds for a lawsuit......The premise of the movie is not a bad one, nor are the actors, and with better writing and editing, it could have been half decent. I feel sorry for the actors. As they watched the final outcome, they must have cringed."
5,excellent gospel rap,I have liked these guys for a long time because of thier ability to combine solid rap with a positive message. Grits has managed to offer some high quality rap to a hungry rap culture. The music is bump'in and the message is jump'in. I Highly reccomend this cut.
5,Elegant prose and insightful analysis,"This reading of Milton's irony has the great virtue of not explaining ""what Milton meant,"" which is a silly thing for a book of literary criticism to do anyway. Instead, Silver makes an argument about Milton's subtlety that is, itself, enacting its own ironies and complexities. Sets the standard for Miltonists."
2,knitting girl,I saw the first box of scarves and thought there were great. I was very disappointed when I opened this box. The designs are not desirable.
2,Discontinued Yarns,"It's very disappointing that many of the nicest scarves are nice because of a yarn, most likely discontinued by now, and not because of the reason you buy this box: the pattern."
4,love this brush!,Love this brush! I bought two. Now I can't live without it. Who would have believed that a hairbrush would make such a difference?
4,Good brush,"I like this brush, it would be better if it has vent holes in the back. came in on time, and make my hair smooth, would just be easier to blow dry with if it had vents."
5,Great book!,"Rose and her family have had to move into town because of hard times, and Rose misses Rocky Ridge Farm. All Little House fans will love this book!"
1,Halloween How-To,"I borrowed this book through our local interlibrary loan system to review its content and I was sorely disappointed. I was expecting a how-to guide for children, based on the cover design, but the book is geared more towards the young adult and adult age group. I was terribly disappointed in the black and white photos the author used, which were tacky and useless. The layout of the page, (i.e., divisions of paragraphs, headings, fonts, etc) could have been vastly improved upon by using color divisions, bars,and such. For an author who prides herself on being a Halloween expert, she lacks the creative edge and eye in her choice of graphic quality to make this book outshine its competition. Also, being a spinal paperback, the pages were easily dislodge from the glue of the spine to be a keepsake book on your bookshelf."
3,"Fun, but forgettable","This action-packed story is a decent way to kill a few hours. It centers around a suicidal man who is cajoled into investigating a prominent statesman as a final favor to an old friend who is editor of a failing newspaper. While the characters are not very well developed, you'll enjoy watching the protagonist uncover a trail of dirty secrets. Just don't think about the plot too closely, or you'll start to see its holes."
4,Not Morrell's best,"Suspenseful at times, good action, but a pattern develops, as I remember (it's been 2 or 3 years since I've read it). The pattern is: 1. our hero runs to a person for help; 2. within minutes assassins kill the person our hero has contacted and our hero narrowly escapes; 3. repeat steps 1 and 2 about a dozen times. Not a terrible book, by any means, just disappointing. Keeps you interested while you're reading, but a week later you think: ""It really wasn't that good after all, was it? And why do I talk to myself so much?"""
2,What is the deal???,"This author basically rips story line from other famous writers (i.e.-Stephen King, Peter Benchley), and submits it into an almost anthological format. You'd expect that because it's part of a trilogy that somewhere along the way, you would get the whole story of the inn and its history, but you get NOTHING. These novels skip from one decade to another with no fillers in between to tie them together. Given the chance, I wouldn't waste my money."
5,inspiration,"The lyrics in combination with the power of Jennifer Knapps voice make this CD, in my opinion most insprational. Jennifers words allow her listeners to relate as she sings of the everyday sins we commit and Gods undying love for us. The songs I find that touch me the most are marters and theives, undo me, refine me, hold me now, whole again and faithful to me. This CD in its entirety is a beautiful display of the artists faith and I like nothing better than to hear someone sing about something for which they are passionate."
5,Wonderful,I was amazed I bought the CD for the song Romans and I love ALL the songs!!!! I hope she continues to sing for a LONG time.
2,Meh.,"This is not really a BAD toy, it's just sort of disappointing. The lettering on the bottom that gives the dinosaurs' names is hard to read, the figures are of indifferent quality, and most galling, several of the included figures are not even of feathered dinosaurs. I know there are not that many fossil feathered dinos to make, but I'd rather have five well-done, honest-to-goodness feathered dinos than a dozen mediocre figures, with about half being just regular old nekkid dinos. Having said that, being able to hold up, say, the microraptor and asking a kid what that could be, and being told that it's a bird, and then being able to say, ""No, that's actually a type of dinosaur""--is a great way of demonstrating visually the evolutionary connection between avian dinosaurs and modern birds. In other words, even a child can begin to grasp that in an important sense, the dinosaurs never totally died out. They just evolved into emus and penguins and sparrows and such."
4,"A Great Send-Up, but Beware","This movie is not about beer, in the way ""Strange Brew"" was. It is an extremely good send-up of the advertising industry.Norbecker sales are plummeting, and A.J. Norbecker is about to fire his ad agency. After running around like headless chickens and firing their creative director, the agency settles on a completely ridiculous and yet extremely effective ad campaign. Meantime A.J. Norbecker contemplates invading and dominating the European beer market. (""Ve vill SMASH Heineken!"")A very funny movie.A word about this on-demand DVD-R: It will probably play on a regular DVD player, but there is a fine-print disclaimer on the box that says it may not play on a computer drive or on a DVR. That turned out to be the case for me: It would not play on my Samsung DVR/DVD player. I had to return it to Amazon. This is the only DVD I ever got that my player could not read."
3,looks great - really cute,"I bought this for my son. It is adorable and we love it. The only problem we have with it so far is that the song is too short. The music box only plays for a few minutes. I have other wind up mobiles that last much longer. When my son is going to sleep I must use a different one, otherwise I'd have to keep going into his room and wind it."
1,All these reviews are a sham.,"Seriously whoever is giving this more than 1 or 2 stars must have something to do with the making or distribution of this film. I watch ALOT of horror whether it be low budget, big budget, foreign, you name it. This is a flaming pile of crap. I am starting to distrust Amazon reviews. To many times have I paid for something with less than a dozen or so reviews to be completely duped into buying a no budget pile of garbage. This seriously looks like a film maybe someone in college would make with the help of a few classmates who happen to have a camera that is half decent. Really it is that bad."
4,a cult classic,"had me on the edge of my seat, a must see ,forget Freddy,Jason & Michael Myers, THE CLOWN has some creepy voice!! It reminded me of a new and improved Shining,with a CRAZY Clown in the mixx.If you enjoy a psychiatrist,drugs,stock broker,a Really big knife & a crazy clown then go see All Dark Places!!"
4,Sell out?,"The only reason I didn't give this cd single 5 stars is the single, Liberty. Liberty sounds like Xymox's flirt with semi-industrial music (sorry, that's the best way to describe it). It's almost as is Xymox is shooting for air time on American alternative radio, which, unfortunately, employs an ""avoid like the plague"" policy to anything laced with synth. Luckily, this cd recovers quite nicely with the other two tracks, Number 1 and At Your Mercy, which are more ""Xymoxy"", especially the latter."
2,picture quality is NO GOOD!!,"Pros-The camera is adorable and tiny, with the easiest to use menu system I've seen on a camera.Cons-THE PICTURES!!! I had an old Kodak EasyShare that took great pictures. Unfortunately, it was stolen while I was on vacation and I bought this one. It takes terrible pictures! I can get decent shots outdoors in the bright sun, but anywhere else and they are dark and blurry, or with an unflattering flash. No matter how still I hold it, I get that stupid red hand.Also, the body is falling apart, all the screws have fallen out."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the favorable reviews here on Amazon and also on Consumer Reports (who reviewed the previous model: v550), I was pretty excited about the camera. Unfortunately, after using the camera for a day, I decided to return it. First, the positives: the camera is very small and compact; it is very attractive; the interface is intuitive; the instructions are clear; and the camera is ready for the next shot almost instantaneously. The negative: the picture quality is very very poor. Specifically, I took a number of indoor shots during the evening. The photos were dark--esp. near the edge of the photos where the images were cloudy. In contrast, I took my older Sony Cybershot camera and took the same shots. The difference in picture quality was dramatic: the Sony shots were brighter and much more crisp. I wanted to like the camera, but in the end the picture quality is unacceptable."
3,A chick flick with a little something for the guys,"Like most romantic comedies these days, Just Friends is predictable and a bit on the sappy side. You'd have to be from another planet not to know how the movie's going to end.But before the obvious ending, there's some fairly funny bits. A lot of the comedy is sophomoric, over-the-top physical humor, but there are parts that will make even the most dour person crack a smile.It's light-hearted fun but, as with most of these movies, the ending (at least for the fellas) is almost embarrasing. If you have to watch a romantic comedy to please your lady, pick this one; it's better than a lot of them."
5,great movie,i love this movie....yeah i thought it would be funnier then it actually was but it was still a great f-ing movie.
5,A Surprise Comedy - The Irony of Rejection,"This was a surprise slapstick comedy over the 2005 Christmas holidays. A typical new version of the guy who left town and went from zero to everything, complete with an extreme makeover. Chris runs off to LA from Jersey to forget his best friend and thwarted paramour. In 10 years (what a difference a decade can make!) .... Chris is buffed, tanned, handsome, successful, and a complete womanizer serial dater of supermodels and all things that look hot in a skirt. He has done everything to forget and erase his former self, and his heartache over his high school unrequited love. A flight to Paris is interrupted by engine trouble and Chris finds himself home in Jersey for the holidays. One run in with his lost love and 10 years of forgetting fall away. Before he knows it, he is back on the mission he had as a teenager - to win her over once and for all.It's formula but cute. Goes to show that the heart has no sense of time."
2,Not The Best...,"As a fan of Ryan Reynolds and someone who loved two of his previous movies - Van Wilder and Waiting - I had high hopes that this movie would at least deliver the same kind of stupid, silly laughter that the previous two movies did. Unfortunately, even though the movie did deliver a fair number of funny moments and great one-liners, it felt flat. Now, I know you don't watch one of these types of movies to look at character development or story arc, but you do need a sense of freshness or ingenuity when it comes to the humor involved or it fails to fully entertain or distract you for a few hours. As much as I laughed, the storyline was unoriginal and you could see what was going to happen - which I admit is not in itself a bad thing - but it took away from the efficacy of the humor. Waiting was a much better movie and much more worth your while."
3,Got it for the Wife,Trying to figure out what to get the wife for extra Christmas gifts. She liked this movie so I got it. Chick flick. It's OK. Now if a man had done this movie...........
5,Favorite Movie!,This is my favorite movie! Ryan Reynolds is hilarious! Happy to have it in my collection. This DVD shipped very quickly
3,Cute But Run of the Mill,"Cute RomCom but nothing too exciting here.I purchased this as a gift for my sister who wanted it and, of course, you can never go wrong staring at Ryan Reynolds for 2 hours!"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"This movie was a huge disappointment. I cannot believe so many people gave it favorable ratings. I only kept watching it since I was stuck on a plane. I found the ""humor"" painful, contrived and sophomoric. All the characters - with the exception of Amy Smart and the ""hero's"" only two - not surprisingly, really - friends, absolutely obnoxious and completely unlikable. How can everybody in this town (his little brother, his mother, her father, her various boyfriends, and so on) be SO repulsive??? This guy's problem had nothing to do with being fat and everything to do with being totally unappealing as a human being."
2,With our own eyes,It was not the book I expected. I intended to order book about Amelia Earhart so was not interested in this subject. My error
1,The previous reviewer is on Crack,"I saw this version on TV, and while Karl Malden is a fine actor, nobody could have made this incredibly lame script believable, and Malden just didn't get Herb Brooks. 'Miracle' is a much better movie, with a much better screenplay. They were painstaking with the recreated hockey scenes in the later movie, and went into much greater detail. Watch 'Miracle,' especially the extra bonus features on the 2nd DVD. The other reviewer probably praised the acting and script of Revenge of the Sith as well."
4,Review#2,Most enjoyable light listening songs and music. I bought the cd after seeing her on Doctor Who and was pleasantly surprised. Well worth a listen.
3,good voice and nice songs,"fun of doctor WHO, my daughter loves Billie and then we found singer'sauthentic talent"
3,It's a disappointment,"To my astonishment, the CD does not contain the song ""A couple of swells,"" which Fred Astaire and Judy Garland sing onstage dressed as bums. It's a terrific song, and not having it on the CD is a crime.If I had known it wasn't on the CD, I don't know if I would have bought it.And Ann Miller's fantastic number, ""Shakin' the blues away,"" is abbreviated, with almost all the tap dancing removed. It may seem silly to have tap dancing on a CD, but I would have preferred to hear the entire number, even when no music was playing."
4,Kid really liked it,"I brought this for my child during Christmas 06. She really liked it and spend a lot of time playing with it. She is 13. We didn't have any problems with it. From what I can see you can buy the dog items, have his own house, a pet friend over etc... I think your kids would like it."
5,"Even better than ""Man and Machine""",I really enjoyed reading this book. There are probably a ton of readers and car-nuts out there who can sympathize with Wilkinson's view while laughing at the way it is told. The Gold-Plated Porsche is a fantastic read.
1,"Big ego, boring story","Had high hopes based on the Amazon reviews, but unfortunately the author, and his story, is not terribly interesting. He is, however, incredibly full of himself. So if that appeals to you, you might enjoy this."
5,Awsome Music even if you're not a Gamer,"The Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus soundtrack was fantastic. I think all classical music lovers should purchace this. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy it. At times, the music was very dramatic and hunting. All in all.... It was great buy!"
3,Patterns not clear,"... I like the overall look of the book, patterns are cute... but the editing is not so good, unless someone out there knows how to repeat an 8 stitch cable pattern over 44 stitch's????"
4,Impressive yet comfortable,"I have ordered many rings from Gem Avenue and they always arrive promptly in a pretty little box with a bow. More importantly, the quality is always high and I've been very satisfied. This ring is amazingly comfortable while still making a statement. The scroll work on the sides is cleanly done, and the citrine's color is clear. I gave this one only four stars because I would have liked the citrine to be a little thicker, but that's really a minor complaint. I will wear this one proudly and often."
1,Not compatible with Wireless Internet,"Nice idea but it does not work with 802.11b or 802.11g WiFi. Even if you just have a computer searching for a signal but no access point active the quality is unacceptable.Without any WiFi I got about 65ft reception, with Wifi I could only get good recepetion when the transmitting and receiving antennas were touching."
1,Only Ike could like this one!,"Vampire Time Travellers tries using every cliche in the book to make itself an interesting movie. However, in this task the low budget B picture does not succeed. The main characters are four college coeds seeking to join a sorority after arriving at campus. This naturally brings the potential of plenty of racy action, but sadly the chicks are about as sexy as Mamie Eisenhower! The plot is extremely weak, relying on gimics such as time travel and vampires to push the story along at a snail's pace. Since the plot is so thin, this movie would have benefitted from star power in the cast. However, I didn't recognize anyone."
5,I really love these songs,I grew up listening to these songs with my mother and I have the cassettes from then but I needed them on Cd.
5,Excellent,Burned few DVDs so far. Burned at 4x. It was very smooth. No failures so far. Excellent quality. Very satisfied so far.
5,rarely a dud,My husband does a lot of recording and will only use Taiyo Yuden. He rarely gets a coaster. Very satisfied with thisbrand..
4,Surprisingly good,"Ghost Warrior is one of those movies I purchased expecting it to be absolutely dreadful, and comedic for that reason. It had all the signs of being a terrible movie. Proudly emblazoned on the video case is ""By the makers of Troll."" That alone makes it look awful. The plot synopsis cements this belief. It's about a Samurai from the 1500s who runs amok in 1980s California.Astonishingly enough, the movie is very good. Sure, there's a whole buttload of suspension of disbelief, but the acting is strong, especially on the part of Hiroshi Fujioka. Watching him makes it easy to suspend disbelief. He is very skilled with his weapons, and his demeanor is redolent with bushido. I'd like to watch more of his films, even though they look uniformly awful. Maybe he's the Japanese version of Rutger Hauer--a good actor with undiscriminating taste when it comes to acting gigs."
2,Happy music with dreadful words,"I had been given a tape of the first two Poi Dog albums while in college. The tape had long since been lost, and I decided to replace it by purchasing CD's. I debated about buying both of the first two CD's, but I'm glad I didn't. My fond memories of this music were squashed when I listened closely to the lyrics. This CD is full of hate and I see that others who have reviewed this CD have come to the same conclusion. I wish I'd never given my money to this band, but at least I didn't buy the first CD, too.The CD is musically interesting, but the lyrics are dreadful. The overall message is that if you aren't an atheist, left-wing, socialist, extreme environmentalist, you don't rate. In the Ancient Egyptians, the singer won't ride a car for anything, but in the very next song, he sings the praises of an ""aimless drive behind a motor wheel"". I'm sorry, Poi Dog, but I have my own brain -- I don't need your new thoughts corrupting my head."
4,One of Blakey's finest.,"This is the album I first heard Art Blakey & his Jazz Messenger's playing on, and I absolutely love it. Some of the hottest piano solos you will ever hear. This is as good as it gets, to my taste. If you're any kind of fan of straight ahead jazz and bebop, the songs are classic and the playing is stellar. Yeah, there's better recording technology now, but the sound is still phenomenal, and the playing...?Fahgeddaboudit."
5,Nikon D80 CheatSheet,This easy to carry foldable sheet provides a quick refresher on how to use the many options available on the Nikon D 80
1,What have you done Marcelo?,I only listened to this album once and it was an agonizing trip back in time that gave a convincing case why nu-metal is dying. Musically this album uses every nu-metal cliche in the book and dilutes it in overcommercialization. (...).Don't waste money on Carajo.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS JUNK!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I received one, and the box was THRASHED (holes, rips, etc.). The finish is so fragile, that just the friction of the cardboard box it comes in was enough to permanently scuff off the finish from top to bottom of every weight-bearing edge of every piece.I figured it was damaged in shipping, so I had Amazon send a replacement. SAME THING! Box arrived THRASHED (ripped, holes, etc.). I looked inside at the pieces and ALL OF THEM WERE SCUFFED TOP TO BOTTOM **AGAIN**. For my own curiosity, I decided to use a sponge on the scuffs and see if they came off. You know what came off? THE FINISH!!! LOL! Don't buy this thing. Seriously, it is a major piece of crap. I'm glad that Amazon only had thrashed boxes in stock, otherwise I might not have seen how fragile the finish was until it was too late. Oh well, about to send this back and try another manufacturer."
4,M2 has been working fine for more than a month now,"I was a bit unsure of buying the $30+ M2 for my Sony Ericsson W300i. But now I am pretty happy with it. I hate carrying many things in my pocket, the phone cum music player just avoids that. It seems to be working fine for more than a month now. Only once my phone restarted when I played some song. But this hasn't happened again.I suggest people to buy the USB cable for the phone along with this card as its too painful to transfer each song to the phone via bluetooth as you have to individually approve each song for copying (on the phone). Or just get the media pack from Sony which comes with the card and the USB cable. Using USB you can directly start the connection in file transfer mode and the card is shown as just any other removable drive."
3,Not compatible with Sony Ericson phone,"This is a good price, but the software that Sony packages with their phones will not recognize this product."
5,great for kids,A very good book on the subject. Our children really enjoyed it. It was a good purchase. We recommend it to other homeschool families. It was just the right amound of information for kids.
5,Can't get enough of Willie Nelson,We have had several hours of pleasant music playing this CD. I am not into mp3 players so I enjoy using a CD.
3,John Derek fantasizes about his own death,"From the literalist standpoint, and seeing it as I did while John Derek was still alive, the movie is an embarrassment. Ghastly line delivery combines with cut-rate special effects as well as glimpses of Ms. Derek's augmented chest and emaciated limbs. Yet you might also interpret the movie as a sad commentary on John Derek's realization that he loved a much younger woman and would die long before she did...and that she would go on to mate with younger guys in tropical locales.As for Bo, I don't know if she dropped off the face of the earth herself. If she doesn't get a reality show of her own pretty quick, only us old folks will remember that she existed at all, and we are of course reluctant to mention her name because we must explain ""cornrows"" at the same time.See the movie just so you can talk about it at a party someday...it will become more relevant as the years go by."
2,What does the title mean?,"After watching this somewhat silly mess, I still have no idea what the title means. Aside from Rip Torn as the grizzled pool hall owner with a heart of gold, the rest of this is sort of a waste. I didn't catch the child abuse angle until the end. The mother's acting is just ok, but you won't want to give this one any awards."
5,Chills,"Not your typical horror movie.Should have been 1988 horror picture of the year! Must see movie! I rate this movie (NTBWA) not to be watched alone!Never heard of it!Well now u have ? Someone needs to make this picture on DVD,please? All over you chills.Two thumbs up!"
5,one of the best 80's sitcom,"This was one of my favorite t.v.shows growing up.I watched it from begining to the end,and it was so sad when they took it off the air.I'm a big fan.please amazon bring it back on dvd."
1,Be Careful,Just got for Christmas. My home computer does not recognize the player even though it recognizes all my other USB devices including an older MuVo N200. A search on internet reveals many are having this same problem. Their technical support stinks. It's only e-mail and you get a response about every 2 days. Good news is that it works on two other computers I've tried it on. I saw a posting saying that someone solved the problem by adding a second USB card. Have spent over 6 hours on this to no avail. I'll bet it works fine if your one of the lucky ones whose computer recognizes it.
4,Very pleased with the product,"I chose to go with this .mp3 player for a couple reasons, partly because I didn't feel I needed more than 2 gigs for what I was planning on using it for (turns out I was right, too; I have yet to fill it with music), and partly because I don't like the idea of a non-replaceable, rechargeable battery (for me, I think it's easier & safer to just use AAA's).The only real drawback for me is that there's no AM/FM tuner. Normally I don't listen to the radio but having it would've been far preferable to the microphone this .mp3 player comes with. If you can overlook that then this is a great buy."
3,Good Product. Basics,"The product is excellent. The only problem is that it doesn't assign for itself a number for each song when is downloaded to the MuVo. So, you have to assign manually a number to each song. But overall, it's a good produc."
3,Huge!,Navigation through the folders and the features more difficult than other models. Lots of storage. Like the plug and play. Lacks FM radio available on so many models.Great look. Great sound. Matched with Altec Lansing 4121 speakers sounds like a huge stereo.
3,"Cheap, but cheap for a reason",I got this barrel extension in the mail and opened it as soon as possible. It looks cheap and feels cheap but it is cheap. My problem with it is that when I screwed it on my HSC M11 it broke off at the barrel end (nothing a little epoxy can't fix). If I could have found a more expensive barrel extension that would fit the proprietary barrel treading on my gun I would have purchased that. All I can say is you get what you payed for with this product.
4,HFC Mock Suppressor,"Cant beat this for the price. I put mine on my Umarex TF11 Mac11 and it works great, but you have to make sure it sits flush with the barrel otherwise it can curve your bbs. It is plastic and is kinda large, around 8.5in long, but for $0.99 you cant beat the look or the price!"
3,They're ok,"These things are huge. They're like 8 inches long and about 2 inches wide. Durable but wont buy again, too big."
2,tna,"i ought this to see sultry sensual sinitta the american born singer who had hits with stock aitken waterman including toyboy and gto.i got more than i bargained for.she showed a tight,pert booty and little perky booberooonies .i rated it 2/5 -one for boobs , one for bum.. the rest of the movie is predictable,2d and forgettable.----"
4,"A perfect example of 'Learn fast, forget fast'","This is a good series. I really can't imagine why anyone would have an issue with this program unless they had short term memory issues(which could be caused by genetics, or legal drugs, or recreational drugs). It is comprehensive for basic conversational, and with diligence, that is, a couple of hours on a CD(2 runs through the same CD a day), you'll be able to speak Japanese in no time. And, as a bonus, you'll be able to forget Japanese in no time too. The faster you learn something, the faster you forget it. Oh, and if you lose the 1st lesson CD, just buy a level one box, as the level of learning is well paced.What is the secret? Probably about two hours a day, for each CD, and about 3 weeks per CD. In other words, drill it into your head until you are dreaming dreams about dreaming in japanese.Oh, and lest you think other wise... this is about 'speaking' japanese, not general reading."
1,Dangerous Book!,This book is dangerous! It is biased and silently encourages people to avoid medications that could greatly benifit them.Discuss any concerns about medications with your DOCTOR and your PHARMACIST.
1,HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"What's cooking!? As you may have surmised from the above title, I was disappointed in having just purchased this book. Firstly, I was unable to find a listing for NARDIL (Phenelzine). That was my primary reason for purchasing this book. While MAO INHIBITORS were vaguely mentioned throughout the book, it was not given its own entry. Secondly, the title of the book is a little misleading. One is led to believe that the entire scope of the book would deal with ADVERSE REACTIONS, INCIDENCE REPORTING, easily categorized REFERENCE CHARTS which lists all the WORST & BEST PILLS, etc. None of this was to be found. Instead, this was nothing more than a regular drug reference book with a few pages dedicated to generalized discussions on adverse reactions and preventions. I find it highly ironic that a book which is titled ""WORST PILLS, BEST PILLS"" would choose to omit NARDIL of all pills. The same NARDIL that is infamous for its life-threatening adverse reactions."
5,Works as expected,A necessity for keeping your Dutch Oven top clean when camping. We also use it as a base for our lid when we are cooking eggs or pancakes. Just put some coals around the stand and you have heat for your Dutch Oven lid to serve as a frying pan!
2,Made in China!,"If you are like me you buy Lodge cast iron because it is American made. There are comparable Chinese cast iron products available. This stand is made in China, not the USA. Clearly, it COULD be made in the USA since it is such a simple tool. I would have made one myself if I knew Lodge was going to sell me a Chinese stand. While the two leg portions of the stand are sturdy, the connecting bolt, washers and nut leave something to be desired. I am disappointed and have not even used it yet. No doubt, this is the best cast iron lid stand that Chinese child prison labor can produce, but I wanted an American product."
2,"In practice, they just don't work well.",The design is simple and you'd think it would work OK but it just doesn't. The problem is that lids just slide right off them if you don't have them perfectly centered. If you do get them on... a simple bump and they slide off. I just can't see to recommend this to anyone.
5,Really good to have,"We recently got more into Dutch oven cooking in the scout troop, and I couldn't think often enough ""Where can I put this hot lid down?"" when checking or adding ingredients. Also good to get some separation from the bottom coals if your oven's legs aren't that tall."
1,"Excellent idea, poor execution","If you're going to dutch oven cook, one must consider the lost heat from the lid. Then, one must purchase a divet to utilize said lost heat from the lid with a cast iron skillet.Waking up to fresh biscuits in the dutch oven, with bacon and eggs cooking on top of the oven is pretty much the best thing ever at 8000 feet in the Sierras.The problem with this approach is this divet has a cheap, aluminum (pronounced al-um-min-i-um) rivet that will fail as soon as you turn your back on it. Leaving you with no means to capture said lost heat with your cast iron skillet. And raw eggs and raw bacon.A cheap fix is a #10 machine screw, a washer and two nuts, but you shouldn't have to. The manufacturer should do it for you. Or use a steel rivet."
5,"So good, it floored me.","I've followed Stan Ridgway's career fairly closely, after having had the good fortune to catch a live Wall of Voodoo show in 1981. Let me say this without equivocation. This is Ridgway's best. Period. You can hear echoes of some of his older stuff in these songs, but, even then, it's an improvement. And rest assured, no record company would ever have approved this raw, ideosyncratic brilliance. Thank God for independent labels.Some highlights: (1) You're Rockin' Chair sounds like a blues classic, with weird dissonance at all levels and near perfect lyrics: (2) Afghan Forklift is like Mark Knopfler meets H.P. Lovecraft meets ... well ... Stan; (3) That Big 5-0 is perhaps the best anthem for middle age I've ever heard--or is it??? I could go on, but trust me. This is as good as it gets."
4,This is Spoon Feeding for Accounts,"The Textbook is ideal for anyone who wants to obtain a excellent grounding in Financial Accounts. This is excellent and suitable book for Financial Accounts Students, particularly MBA (finance)."
2,Does have a wanna-kiss scene,"I bought this book for my son, as they did watch the movie. It looks very good, however, it did have a illustration with Lava Girl puckering up to get a kiss. I am a mom who doesn't encourage this stuff with my little ones or rather doesn't want them reading such things. I know it's small but still, I wanted to warn other parents. I ended up throwing the book away because of the one picture, as I couldn't remove it without ruining text on the other side of the page."
4,Good movie,Nice fairy tale movie for the kids. Good humor and action for the kiddies. Bought this after good the second one and plz'd the second one followed the premise for the first movie. Get the popcorn and snacks for a pleasant afternoon.
2,not attractive just only for kids,"hoodwrinked this version is very different from chinese onenot good,only for kidsamazon is expensive and watch on computer is not clear"
3,Hoodwinked on Hoodwinked,"Hoodwinked was a cool movie to watch. Not in the same league as Shrek or Ice Age, but it was ok. Clever script but it could have used some more gags."
2,"Poor animation, poor jokes, poor directing.","It's mind boggling how they got so many celebrities to do the voices for such a badly animated movie. Sorry but the animation was WAY below today's standard and it killed the whole experience for me. Oh, and the jokes were lame and old, too."
1,"I wanted out of this ""hood""","This movie ranks as one of the worst of all time. It does not have an original idea to offer anywhere. The spoofs of other movies that it serves up (ala Shrek, Madagascar, etc., etc. etc.) have all been done before in much funnier fashion. They also seem far too familiar and become tedious and boring very quickly, which is why I wanted out. The music (can I even call it that?)soundtrack for this movie is simply earsplittingly loud and obnoxious. Maybe the sound engineers knew how bad this movie was and figured if people were cringing from the soundtrack they wouldn't pay attention to the movie? Sadly the animation from most 80s video games is better than you anything will see here. This movie is a disaster all the way around. Save your money and stay away from this ""hood."""
5,"Clever, Funny, Family Gem","The songs, characters, voices, and story are what make this movie a true family gem. One of our favorites. We are on our second copy because the first got lost in our last move. The kids and I love this movie; even my husband who barely tolerates ""kid stuff"" loved it. The animation is not as good as other CGI movies but was never a detraction for us. It's also nice to see a family movie without so many adult undertones. Adult humor is not needed to make a kids movie adult friendly. We were always lending it to others who found it just as delightful as we did."
5,VERY CLEVER! ~~~1 of the 3 BEST Animated Films of 2006!,"Isn't it just grand when someone takes an old story and turns it on it's head and makes something remarkably clever out of it? How neat is this?..... to find something so NEW in a story SO old!What happens to be going on here is:Remember Little Red, and her story? Well, did you ever ask yourself if you got the correct story...all of it? The directors and brains behind this great little animation did just that....they have cleverly devised an ""inquest"", and all the characters of the story get grilled on what happened, and what they saw and did. This is so cool! Don't be worried about the people who said it stunk or was boring...obviously they couldn't figure out the premise here! Take my word and check out this VERY creatively done, REthought, slightly bruised, story. ~operabruin(by the way, if you were wondering, the other two animated greats of 2006 are: ""Over the Hedge"", and ""Happy Feet""--pick them up, also, as all are charming.)"
5,Hoodwinked is great,"I went to see the movie 3 times. I loved it every time and now I see it is coming out finally on dvd in May. One of the best parts of the movie aside from the beautiful job the cast did, is the soundtrack to it. Critters Have Feelings is one of the best trailer songs in years. I hum it all the time. I agree that Twitchy is the star of the show, Red was absolutely divine and granny is extreme. Anne Hathaway is great."
4,An undervalued Composer,"I recently discovered the symphonic music of Niel Wilhelm Gade, and I have to say I wish I had done so sooner. You can have a very pleasant time listening to them. In this Volume of the setChristopher Hogwood and the DNR give warm heartfelt performances of the symphonies numbers 4 & 7 along with a concert overture.All of the pieces reveal a warm Romantic sound and a NorthernFlavor. Gade was a Dutch composer who was much admired byMendelssohn. I for one am glad that Chandos and Christopher Hogwood and the DNR have decided to bring the Symphonies of N.W. Gade to a wider audience. There are Four volumes in the symphony series Volume One features the symphonies nos. 2&8, Volume 3 features Symphonies 3&6 and Volume 4 which will be released soon features Symphonies 1&5. The Symphony no. 5 is unusual as it features a very promiate part for the piano."
4,fetishist finds love & death in a pair of women's shoes,"Fetishist finds the life instinct and the death instinct shod in a pair of brown court shoes. For fans of ""Fermata""."
4,"enjoyable reading, a page-turner",A witty and sober view of the balance between sexual needs and social normalcy. The narrator is constantly conscious about the balance and conflicts between the two. A fine work with a kinky overtone. Taught me everything I ever need to know about foot fetish.
3,"Still have headaches, but better than the rest.","I still get headaches when I wear these, but they aren't as bad with these as with the regular ones. I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more. The hair doesn't slip on these, so that's nice. However, they are very brittle and I've broken quite a few of these."
4,"Love these, but they're breakable","They really don't hurt my head, and that's wonderful. Also, the design is very nice looking. They will break, so I've gotten several over the years. I used to find them at Wal-Mart but not any more. So I'm glad Amazon has them!"
1,WTF? ZERO STARS!!!!!,"Wow...how can I explain the utter mind-numbing power of this movie, (if you can call it a movie). I watched this on TV and I swear I was praying for commercials. BORING. Nearly zero plot, horrible acting, too many actors doing absolutely nothing for this ridiculous piece of crap. Just an overwhemingly STUPID movie. I hope the network didn't pay more than six cents to air this ""D"" film. I really should have been able to rate this zero stars."
5,Stimulating,"With this album, Simon Standage continues his survey of the 40 odd concertos for strings by Vivaldi. As with period practice, winds are added to a few of the works. The continuo consists of harpsichord and guitar, the latter a very appealing sounding period instrument. There is less unity of mood on this album than on Volume 1 of this series. Instead, one is prone to gasp at Vivaldi's prodigious invention. There is never any let up in the profusion of fresh ideas and interesting orchestration. The Collegium Musicum 90 plays with great spirit but never any coarseness. Standage's tempos never dawdle, but nothing ever seems rushed for virtosity's sake. Standage seems to have enormous respect for this music, even if it is one of the more obscure aspects of Vivaldi's genius. The sound engineering, as usual for Chandos, is excellent. If you are a collector, I would start by acquiring Volume 1 of this series first, then moving on to this superb CD."
4,Super bright !!!,"I purchased this unit as a replacement for the bulb that came with the lights as it burned out. This replacement has a much brighter, whiter light than the stock bulb which actually forced me to buy a second bulb son they would match. Bottom line is they work better than the stock bulbs and truly impress with their brilliance. The only reason I do not give it five stars is the price which is on the high side."
2,wow wannabe,"Just can not compare to World of Warcraft. I stopped playing WOW several months ago because it was just so addictive and requires too much time. I was hoping Everquest would have shorter quests and be less involved. I guess I got what I was looking for. I found Everquest to be extremely boring and the quests are too easy an 8 year old can complete them. Overall the gaming is a copy of WOW, just not as good."
5,Most underrated movie of the 80's,"Walker, a brilliant and remarkable film made by Alex Cox never found its crowd.The few people who saw it in theaters didn't seem to get it. It did a bit better on video release but not much,which is a shame. The movie is a historic black comedy that's both anachronistic and compelling in its execution. Its still amazing to me that this was even green-lighted by the powers in Hollywood. Made in Nicaragua with a stellar cast led by Ed Harris it holds up quite well today. Bloody,violet,and at times simply hilarious in its absurdity, this movie rocks. Hopefully now remastered superbly on DVD,it will(if there is any justice in the universe) find a whole new generation that will get it. I loved this movie in '88 and I love it even more now.They simply don't make crazy,surreal,political westerns like this anymore. I would argue that Walker is one of the most brilliant and entertaining flicks ever made.""nuff said"""
5,Finally found it,"I searched for this video for a while and finally found it used on amazon. Leary of buying used I had resisted for some time, but other than a few pause fuzzes that don't affect the watchability the tape was fine, and the movie was as good as I remembered. Action, adventure and a hot redhead combine to hold my attention. Classic military drama."
5,yay,"love the movie and this little extra was really fun and cute. but I'm not keeping it on my iPod, watching once was good enough."
1,dumb at best,"this is waste of time. at least I did not like it.so much waste of my time, and the content its boring."
1,Not What We Thought,"My wife got this without realizing it was not the movie, but just the ""making of"" clip. Not worth getting even for free! lol"
3,This was just a practice run for downloading from Amazon,This was a freebie trailer for the movie. I knew that and choose it to see how long it would take me to download a movie from Amazon.com to my computer. I gave up after about 13 minutes. It was suppose to be a 5- minute trailer. I can just imagine how long it would take to download the full version of any of their movies.
3,It is a coffee table book. About Marhall McLuhan's ideas. Interesting to flip through.,It is a nicely designed book. Nice Images and quotations from Marshall McLuhan. It is fun to flip through though it is not a book in a tradtional sense. Very McLuhan that's all I can say really.
3,Untimely death from a big name company,"Bought this unit in June, 2006. It was manufactured in Feb. 2006. All the while I had it, the unit worked fine. It wasn't hard to learn all the ins and outs of the keypad. It heated food in a reasonable amout of time, but the food usually was not heated evenly. Some food on a dish was hot, while some part of it was luke warm.In Feb. 2012, the unit all of a sudden ran with a horrible sound and stopped heating food at all. Only after 5 1/r yrs, the unit dropped dead. This is not what I would have expected from a Sharp product. Will not buy Sharp anymore. My previous microwave was a Panasonic that ran for took 16 yrs only to die in a flood. I think I will go back to looking into that brand product again. The only reason I didn't buy another Panasonic at the time is because it wasn't a choice at the time I needed to replace it. I only buy a brand I can trust. When one brand fails me, I buy a different brand. I never get taken to the cleaners twice by one company."
2,Not a stellar recording at all.,"I got excited when I saw this cd and bought it. I thought, if it has Robert King it must be good. The playing is virtuosic but somehow lackluster. It doesn't have the elegance of old-fashioned recordings, nor the rich authentic sound of today's recordings. The accompaniment is somehow completely blurred and all I really can follow distinctly is the solo line. While technically precise, the solo playing is not very creative. Sometimes the true sound of the authentic instruments shines, as in the concerto ""La Notte,"" but for the most they just sound fuzzy and distant."
3,Woman Dual Breast Enhancement Exerciser Pump,"I felt the cost was a fair price.The item was delivered im a timely manner.The product itself, was not quite what I anticipated.It is very difficult to operate alone.It has very poor suction, when both cups are used.The cups are circular in shape which leads to poor contactbetween the cups and body, thus causing air leakage.Overall, I am happy with the price and service but,the product left alot to be desired."
5,a must have for nature and Alaska-lovers!,"Wonderful, fun book... animals who live in Alaska each have their own nursery rhyme that describes the animal and its' habitat. Illustrations are fun and some of the rhymes are hilarious. I loved the book so much I purchased it while on my honeymoon before our children were even conceived! Definately unique. Different than other books in that both the child and the parent enjoy reading this book."
2,The most horrific thing about the movie is the painting.,"OK. I'm a sucker for old style horror. You know the type, has a plot, suspense, shock some gore, happy endings (sometimes)?Well this isn't one of them.A very pleasant to look at Tom Selleck complete with a Robin Masters type sports car but set in the Phillipines not Hawaii is the central part of the movie and that is about it.A devilish story, with demonic acting and about lousy paintings which carry the spirits of long dead witches seeking revenge is essentially the plot but it is just a mess really with cheesy special effects and bad acting and the worst thing was I watched it right the way through until the end on late night tv when I could have been sleeping through it instead.Next time, I will record movies like this and be ruthless about getting rid of them when they appear to be as bad as this.Hubble bubble toil and too much trouble."
5,An all time favorite album,"I'm a great guitar jazz fan and buy a lot of albums including Kurt Rosenwinkel. I think I have all of them, at least the official ones. My two favorites are ""Deep Song"" on Verve and this one, ""East Coast Love"" with his trio including the incredibel Avishai Cohen on bass and the dynamic drummer Jorge Rossy. The sound is on high end level and so is the music. It has an excellent mix of standards and originals. It is hard to explain why it is so good, but whatever they do, it makes you feel you are a part of journey. Listen and most likely you will be completely embraced of the music and the sound. In spite of Kurt's and Avishai's relative youth on this album you really feel they are masters taking Pat Methenys and John Scofields playing to another level never heard of before. Go get it!"
3,Love the design but...,"I really really like the minimalist design of this stand and the nice space underneath that I can put items in.But in the end, this stand only works a Mac because the Mac is designed to dissipate heat through its aluminum shell which works perfect with this metal stand.However, I was trying to use this with a non-Mac and most non-Mac laptop has to suck air in through the bottom of the laptop to dissipate heat. A stand that's a solid piece of metal would block most if not all of the vents at the bottom of non-Mac laptop."
4,"Nice laptop stand, wish it was collapsible","I received one of these as a gift to use at work with a MacBook Pro and bought a second one for use at home. It's sturdy and stylish and well worth the price. I only wish it was collapsible so I could fit it in a laptop bag. It conducts heat well. My laptop used to be very hot to the touch after sitting on a wooden desk for a few hours. With this laptop stand, the hottest part of the laptop is barely above room temperature."
4,"Sturdy, attractive... and too tall","This is a pretty good stand for my MacBook. It looks good, is all one-peice construction, appears durable, and provided good ventilation- which is why I bought it. My only issue is its too tall, significantly tall. It elevates the computer around 3 inches off the desk (which is at the right height for me to type on a laptop with the back raised on a slope for ventilation), so I have to hold my hands and arms in the air to type. I would have been okay with a half inch or so of rise, but several inches is just not doable for me. So, it is a good stand in general, but be aware of the offset height before ordering one to ensure you are happy with it."
3,"Nice stand, but lot of troubles","Firstly, this is so attractive. Secondly, it's simple. You will love it at the first look, it's a perfect match for your Macbook. However, when you buy this you need to know that you need a good keyboard and mouse. Furthermore, make sure you are able to be comfortable to read things on a small screen from a longer distance. Also, this stand is steady, you cannot customize it."
4,"Looks Great, Does The Trick","What's there to say? It's a bent piece of aluminum that you put a laptop on. Hard to go wrong there.There's one flaw, which is that the angle is a little too steep for the existing Apple laptops. The lid hinge needs to be opened fully to overcome it and still be usable."
4,"Great product, but overlooked a detail","This is a great stand for my 13"" MacBook Pro (bought in late 2009). It positions the screen at a good height, and looks like a perfect match for the aluminum MacBook. The only problem is, like others have mentioned, that they didn't make the hole big enough for a DVI cable plug. It's not that big of a deal since you can get a HDMI cable w/ DVI adapters or a HDMI to DVI cable, but that's the sort of detail that makes the difference between a 5 star and a 4 star item. Overall I still highly recommend this product. After having tried many different plastic laptop stands from other companies, I think the extra I paid for this item was well worth it for the huge difference in quality."
4,Worked as advertised.,"This was exactly what I was looking for to get my 13"" MacBook Air at the correct level to serve as a second monitor."
5,Excellent Laptop Stand for a desktop,"I was using my Laptop on my desk and was having some trouble because the 15.4"" screen was too low and too far away. This laptop stand does a great job of getting the screen up to my eye level. Also it has room underneath the stand to allow me to put my wireless keyboard out of the way if I need the space for writing. It is sturdy and does everything I had hoped it would do."
5,A perfect match for a MacBook Pro,"This stand replaced an adjustable plastic stand I had picked up from Office Depot last summer.The mStand is great. It's stable, sturdy, stylish and keeps the CD drive exposed so I can easily use it, which was a problem with my other stand. The design also allows you to store stuff under it which is convenient."
4,"Good stand, not great","I bought this for my Apple MacAir and it is a good stand. I wish it was adjustable for height, but it does the job."
5,great!,"This music is amazing, I have had this Cd before and just wanted to buy it as a present for a friend, had hardtime finding it since it was discontinued... Hurry up if you want to buy it, before Amazon runs out of it!"
3,good movie,i like this movie that he is in. i had to wait for the cost to go down for a year and i finally had got it. i think that if you are a big usher fan that you will have to see this movie. you will love it for sure.
4,Lost Classic,Some great tunes here. Produced by Dave Allen who was so important with the Cure. Not radio friendly but great for fans. Too bad they morphed into something else in 2011. Keep the dream alive.
3,GREAT MOMENTS.....MANY FLAWS,"Nicolas Roeg was once one of the GREAT directors of the 1970's. With ""Performance"", ""Walkabout"", ""Don't Look Now"", ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" and ""Bad Timing"" he built a reputation for being a man who didn't compromise his vision to just pander to mere entertainment. Indeed these 5 movies are his most rewarding and challenging works. With ""Eureka"" Roeg begins to slip. There are some great Roegian moments in the film and the first half with Gene Hackman is compelling at times but as the film goes on it loses steam and just simply turns into a courtroom drama. From what I've read of Roeg, he likes this film very much and while it is very good in places as a whole it just doesn't have that vision that his previous work had. After this film his choices of material did not match his odd style and seem mostly like vehicles for Theresa Russell(it seems he was a better director BEFORE she came into the scene)."
3,It Takes Some Getting Use To,"It takes some getting used to. Not as fantastic as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the thing works! Very flexible, silent, easy to clean, my desk space seems bigger then when using a conventional keyboard. Everything that was promised. But due to its flexibility, keying things takes some getting used to. You need to hit the keys on their center and hard or it won't always take. The space bar, the back space and hitting caps almost every time I want the letter A are a few of my common errors. It does take some getting used to. In a way, I miss my standard keyboard and might even revert back to it. That's not to say that I regret the purchase. It's a cool product, but i don't know... I just think that maybe for everyday use at home, the standard keyboard ends up with a the advantage."
3,Great to have full size keyboard no so great typing,I like that I can bring this keyboard anywhere and have a full size keyboard and number pad but using this is less than friendly. The backspace key is just the size of any other key and easily missed. I have pressed insert more times than I would like to count. The feel of the keyboard is a little funky so it is hard to keep the fingers home for touch typing. I think I will hold on to this keyboard for those times when I need to full size keyboard on but I don't think I will use it as often as I had hoped.
4,Coach Yourselff!!!!!,"The book title says it all - Skills, Drills, & Strategies. It takes you from the very beginning showing basics of stance and release to straightforward strategies in approaching spares in a logical manner to ensure you convert them sensibly. Think about it, you make all your spares and your average is likely to be at least 170 - not bad for the weekly bowler. This is part of the Teach, Coach, Play series and allows you to follow a predetermined pathway to bowling success. Some of the self analysis reviews are drawn out in text but if your at the alley you won't be using them anyway - not really necessary. Get this book and you will improve."
5,Soothing To The Soul,"This is one of those CDs that you want to sit back and relax too. So moving and so soothing to the soul, body and mind."
3,I'm still not sure if macrobiotics is the way to go,"I have memories of my grandfather dying of cancer, so when I saw this book I immediately read it. This book is very inspirational and the author's story of surviving cancer holds your attention throughout. I like the fact that he didn't just talk about diet, but also mentioned how his faith helped him through. However I am not entirely sure if macrobiotics (the diet mentioned in this book) is the way to go for cancer patients."
2,A Film The Stars WishThey Had Not Made,"This turkey about rival biker gangs (featuring Dennis Hopper during his Easy Rider phase) was noteworthy for performances by Hopper, Jock Mahoney and Casey Kasem, but afterward they probably wished they'd never gotten involved with it."
5,The BEST children's CD ever,"""Hello! Did you know today is the day of King Cole's Birthday party? And Georgey Porgy and Jack and Jill and Mary are planning to go to London town...""Yes, I have this CD memorized after listening to it a million times with my 14 month old son. He received it on his 1 yr birthday and he adores it. It immediately calms him and he stops what he's doing to listen. I love it!"
2,didn't help much,"This didn't help my nail peeling and easy breakage near as much asNail Tek Nail Program, II Intensive Therapy .5 fl oz (15 ml). Also the matte is truely unnoticable on the nail - would be great for a guy, but I'd prefer to have a little shine."
2,"Rock ""N Learn: Multiplication Rap",I do not think that the cd is done very well. It jumps around alot and they played a lot of music at the beginning. The person doing the rap has a weird voice.
1,Not for me!,"I am not as impressed with this product. Maybe it is because I am not ""tiny"" like the other reviewer said. I thought the keys were way too close together. I am not a perfect typist but i do not look at my keyboard when typing and this keyboard does not have the keys in the same place as other keyboards. This was annoying and I could not subsequently use this keyboard. It looks really cool though. I got this because my friend's husband swears by this company's keyboards. I don't think he had this model, however."
3,A big disappointment,The CD title doesn't describe the contents. I have always been a fan of Desmond since the days he and Dave Brubeck had top-ten records in the '50s. This CD included too much of the other musicians on most selections and not enough of Desmond. Anybody who is unfamiliar with Paul Desmond's playing would be grossly misinformed about him if they believed the title!
4,Great product,"I mostly just wanted something electronic to put my schedule in. I don't need the fancy games or internet or anything on it, so this product was perfect for me! It looks a little older than I thought it did in the picture, but I'm not a stylish person to begin with so it was no big deal. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants something simple and easy to use to schedule things!"
4,Palm in general...,"Depending on how up to date with the newest technology you are, depends on how you take my review. I myself am not too thrilled about the phone computer organizer that does it all. I have been looking and looking for a personal organizer period. Palm fits my needs. Everything I want in an organizer, and nothing I care not for. I love the idea of any information I might need being in a pocket in my purse. Notepad and numbers and all. Great for having a business on the go and needing to resource numbers often. Love it. Too bad technology is far too advanced for my little Palm pilots. :)"
5,Basket Caddy,"I really thought the quality of the basket is excellent. I would recommend it. I didn't particularly care for the grape vine ruffle I picked though, it was too dark. Thank you."
4,Good CD!,"This is a really cool CD. The best songs are 4, 5, 6 and 11. The only reason I gave it four stars was because a few songs lacked talent, like number 7. I also didn't like the bonis song. It seemed they were going for big names, but in the end, they all sounded the same. I didn't even hear 98o, or Robin S. But I still like this CD."
2,Very dated information.,"This book is dated. A lot of the things it tells you to do aren't done that way anymore or they don't even exist. This book did not give me the infomation I was looking for, being someone who had been selling on Amazon for a little while I was looking for more insider information to help me list a litle faster or find the top selling items in a catagory and things like that."
3,Nice book with caveats,"I don't remember why I bought this, because the very title screams BS. Anyway, I did and it is not a bad read. However, like most ""how to"" books, you can find everything in the book with a little work on your own. In this case, everything in the book is in various Amazon help files, with the exception of a few fulfillment services discussed at the end. Anyway, I don't know about making a ""fortune"", but it nicely puts all of the necessary information in one place."
4,"Great Product, great Seller!",I recently bought MSDN Library 6.0 from Artem Chaprasov through Amazon. It is my impression that these help files are absolutely necessary for anyone planning to work with any member of the Visual Studio family. The MSDN Library is quite useful to me and I have already started reaping the rewards for buying it as I am using Visual Basic for creating GUIs for my programs.I also want to comment on the fact that this would be my very first time to buy any product from Amazon's sellers. I was very impressed that the MSDN Library that I bought from Artem Cheprasov is in a much better condition than I expected. I whole-heartedly recommend this seller's products to anyone because his word is his bond.
5,What an inspiration!,"Reading through this book will send your mind spinning with ideas! The problem is which to do first! Or how many to start at once! There are so many great gift ideas in this book I can't wait to start some Christmas projects already. The trouble will be keeping them secret until Christmas because I most definately will want to start showing them off as soon as they are finished...or sooner! (Can you tell I love this book! I haven't used this many exclamations points in one paragraph in a long time!)My daughter has already begun Joseph's Blankie of Many Colors with Simply Soft Yarn (blues, greens and purples). It is turning out lovely and will keep her going for a while. She finishes projects *really* quick and is always looking for another project to start."
5,"Funny, great patterns","My mom bought me this for my birthday. I was skeptical because she's a non-knitter so what would she know about a book on knitting? It's wonderful. The authors are funny writers and I enjoy the cultural references. The charts are well-written, the patterns provide good explanations, and the items that you can knit are varied and interesting. I will use the book in two ways: as a funny read and as a pattern book."
1,Only for Yoga New-bees,"The DVD shows how to perform very simple yoga moves that anyone can do. There is little or no mind/body connection essential to true yoga practice. It is geared toward first-timers, senior-seniors, or those who are not at all physically fit. For everyone else, however, it is a numbing bore--a very poor yoga experience."
3,1999=1996?,"Does the #1 reggae single of 1996 justify a five-star rating, a prediction that this Colby-Jack cheesy guy would take the reggae world of 1999 by storm? To be honest, through most of the album I could scarcely have identified the music as reggae in my perceived-to-be-conventional sense. It is perhaps watered down/commercialized, but it's also somewhat smoother and an easier listen. Fans of the genre should buy it if they want something ""new""; just don't think it's essential."
2,"Despite it's ""fat"" design","Despite the fat design on this salt grinder, it holds very little salt. Additionally, the grind is way to course and it leaks salt anytime you put it down. I would not recommend this grinder at all."
3,WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A 1970'S MUSICAL ADAPTATION BUT ALL IN AL IF YOU ARE A FAN OF H.G. WELLS AND THE WAR OF THE WORLDS MOVIE IT IS WORTH HAVING
4,Rock classic out-rocks Spielberg,"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the Worlds has stood the test of time. The ""dated-ness"" of the music only adds to the spooky retro feel of Martian machines attacking 19th Century England. For progressive rock this is quite an achievement, with full-throated vocals and amazing intrumentation and orchestration. Richard Burton's amazing voice gives the narration a startling dramatic quality that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I owned the LP as a boy and the release of yet another ""updated"" War of the Worlds movie prompted me to buy the CD of this 1976 opus.Now how about an animated ""War of the Worlds"" movie, set to the music of Jeff Wayne?"
2,Cheap,Received as a gift. It was difficult to put the pencils/crayons in their slots and seems like it will be a pain for my 5 yr old to remove them to do her artwork. It's cheap plastic. Waste of money.
2,More annoying than useful,"I originally wanted this to help organize my daughter's supplies. It turns out that this thing is more annoying than anything. When you open the case, the mold that holds all the supplies unattaches from the actual case, and then it becomes a mess. The markers come out of place etc. I'm probably just going to get a couple of little school boxes to keep the supplies in."
2,The worst Crayola product I have ever purchased.,"I can usually depend on Crayola products and I appreciate their quality. But this latest product is horrible! The red case is very flimsy and the black plastic trays fall out the minute you open the case. My daughter thought she secured her items in place, only to find that when she opened the case again they all came spilling out onto the floor. She was devastated that her art supplies broke and now won't touch the case. I threw the thing away and bought a Rose Art kit instead! Shame on you Crayola! If you can't produce a quality product then don't produce anything at all!"
4,Works extremely well....,"I wasn't expecting this to fit my dryer, considering I couldn't find a review that said it did. It fits my Conair 1875 ( i think thats what it is) quit well. Not a smooth or easy attatch or detachment process, but it fits! It occasinally start to smell hot it I leave the hot too long, but no issues so far!"
2,Not Worth the Time to Read!,"Sandra Brown has the reputation as the author ""who can't write her books fast enough"". Well I thnk that reputation has come to a complete halt. Some of her books as writen so quckly and carelessly that they lack the romance and character depth as some of her beter novels...All and all save your time for a better more well thought out novel."
1,Horrible,I thought this book was horrible. I've read alot of this author and if this was the first book I read I would never read any more of hers.Her husband dies and she starts having an affair with the district attorney and he's in love before he ever meets her. Get real.
3,"Okay for a Romantic Read, but Not much Plot","This book was enjoyable to fill the quiet times at work. A lighthearted read, but there really was no plot to speak of. This is just a romantic story of two people meeting and falling for each other. I must admit I am a fan of Sandra Brown, usually she writes a good thriller with a romantic vein running through it. However, Sweet Anger is nothing but the romantic vein and is somewhat outlandish. Overall, if you are looking for a simple love story with many detailed love scenes, you will be satisfied."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY !!!!!!!!,"What utter nonsense ! Dreadful drech; one example : at the start an American ( so-called scholar) declaims "" He was a wise man and a murderer ; a genius and a psychopath . He was all these things and perhaps none of them ."" What the hell is THAT supposed to mean ???!!!!!!!!!It's all down hill from there."
5,Perfect addition to Lynn 's book: Building your ideal private practice,"I'm reading both Lynn Grodzki's books together and doing the exercises, etc. It's easy reading, and simple to follow. I'm looking forward to seeing my practice evolve."
3,Useless but fun,"As an instructional video, this is a total joke. The models clearly have no idea what they're doing, and move with none of the grace and fluidity of real t'ai chi. Basically, they just look good naked, which is what this video is really about. It's only worthwhile as a cheap thrill and a cheap laugh. The funniest part is the model on the right -- she can't get some of the moves quite right because her breasts are too big to get her arms past! The biggest disappointment, aside from its uselessness as a workout video, is that the sexiest model (the one on the left) was missing for most of the last 1/4 of the tape. I only gave it three stars because I thought it was funny, because the women were nice-looking, although wooden, and because I love the fact that there's not a single piece of clothing to be seen on this entire tape."
1,Padraig Pearse died for this???,"This book, along with the other two, are beyond generic Ireland. They're an insult to the Irish people. Ms. Roberts makes a big thing about her love for the country but it's obvious she has never been more then a weekend tourist. The entire trilogy is built on a shaky foundation shot full of holes that could have been plugged with just a day or two of internet research. I'm especially turned off by the way she has ignored anything negative in Irish history and skirted the English Occupation like it never existed. The pub in the book was built three years before the start of the Great Famine yet she never addresses how the Gallagher family dealt with it and managed to pull the pub through.I'm all for love winning the day but this is formula romance badly researched with stock characters I could care less about. You want a good love story with some REAL Irish culture? Go read Morgam Llewellyn."
3,Couldn't stand Darcy,"I'm sorry, I'll be honest, Darcy just grated on my nerves. There were some parts where I just wanted to hit her, but I read this book for the sake of completion of this trilogy. The story of Carrick continues, and comes to a end in this book (as one could easily predict)"
2,Not one of her Best.,"Having read all her books, this one was awful. I loved Jewel of the Sun and Tears of the Moon; but this book lacked something. I've enjoyed all her trologies and family series such as The Macgregors, but this book lacked what we look forward in Nora Roberts. Heart of the Sea was not a perfect ending to this series."
3,OK wrap up to the series,"While it wasn't a bad way to wrap up the series, I just didn't like this one as much. I would have liked to seen more of Darcy's softer side. It's there, but it seems the story focuses on how shallow and selfish Darcy can be. I liked Trevor (who wouldn't like a handsome rich man who comes and sweeps you off your feet!) But, I didn't feel their romance was as believable as the ones in the first two stories. I also wish there was more focus on Carrick and Lady Gwen when the spell was broken. The legend is so woven into the story and then all you get at the end is their riding away on a winged horse."
4,"Charming, but a bit disappointing","I had looked forward to the other books in this series. After the romance of Aidan and Jude, I hoped that the others would be as spellbinding and delightful. I found the story of Brenna and Shawn somewhat contrived and uninspiring and this last between Darcy and Trevor somewhat lacking in electricity as well. While the two main characters are strong individuals and the legends woven into the story make it interesting, I find Darcy a little too flippant to be a very lovable character and Trevor a little too concerned with business. The ending picked up a little, but frankly this was a book that I started, then read a few pages here and there, only to put it down for several weeks, not really caring if I finished it or not. I would not go racing to buy it."
4,--The photographs tell the story--,"After reading this, I did come away with a little more knowledge about Queen Elizabeth's life, but the best part of this book are the photographs. It was a nice surprise to see how attractive Queen Elizabeth was as a child and young woman. I had the impression that taking on the crown of England turned a pretty 25 year old woman into a matron much older than her years. I think that the pictures speak for themselves in how well they reveal the character and strength of the Queen. This is an enjoyable book, even if you're not an Anglophile."
3,Accesories and Features Leave a Lot to be Desired,"The picture quality is good but the sound was not so great at first. We had to try different settings to improve it and eliminate the background static noise. The headphones that came with the unit is for an infant sized head. What is up with that? The feature buttons on the remote and the unit itself are not user friendly. We need to buy our own headphones and spend more time trying to figure out how to change settings. Overall, I say it is an OK unit but I wanted a great unit. I would not purchase another item made by Coby."
4,Melissa and Doug,"I purchased a box of this to try with my daughter's Melissa and Doug train-set; now I am purchasing three more boxes. I've never worked with model trains, but I guess that we need a clip for every piece of track because we have to build on carpet. I did find that the instructions didn't tell me everything that I needed to know in order to use the clips easily. You need to slide the clip into place, not snap it into place.1. Slide the clip completely onto the female piece of track.2. Place the male piece of track; the clip should not be in the way.3. Slide the clip back a little so that it is centered over the junction of the two pieces of track.When I do it that way, it's pretty slick."
5,Great idea!,These are great! They allow the kids to make track designs and hold them together while they play.They are easy to put on and work wonderfully.
4,Great help!,"I'm grateful for reading about Suretrack on a review of another product. The little pieces certainly do help to keep the track together at difficult points. My 4 1/2 year old grandson would get so frustrated that the track kept coming apart on hills or when elevated for any length. The Suretrack prevents that, and he has learned to use it himself. I may need to get more."
5,excellent quality product!,"This is an extremelly high quality product recommended by nutricionists in Brazil! I have been using it for years and the results are great, yet it is gentle enough for your stomach."
1,i ask for packets same as picture they bring me a gallon,i'm serprized from that when i ask for packets and they bring me a gallon big one not what i asked for
3,High Quality Product / Taste Terrible,"Don't get me wrong, this is a high quality product, that contains more protein per serving than many other protein powders. But honestly, this has got to be the worst tasting drink i've ever had. If you can get over the nasty taste, then i highly recommend this product. I am on my second day of taking this powder, and i'm back on amazon looking for something else."
4,"Good protein, but I like other better","I was looking for 100% whey isolate, the chocolate is not really chocolatey enough for me. but all in all mixed well tasted OK, worked well"
2,Tastes like cardboard.,"Really, the title says it all.Originally, I bought this product because it is so low in carbs and offers lot of protein per serving. However, I could not continue this for any period of time because of the taste and the fact that I tended to get sick after taking a recommended serving. Unfortunately, I have no other feedback on how this works because it was that tough to put down. I have switched to GNC's popular Amplified products and have been happy with taste and performance."
1,Horrible,"This product was creamy. I mixed it with almond and coconut water like other products I've used. However, the after taste was absolutly terrible. I also use a mixer bottle and the product did not mix well at all. Pretty much says it all, horrible taste, not so great texture, I hate to spend the money on premium shakes but I guess I have to."
4,Great taste & easy to mix,"Tried both orange banana & mango peach. Will continue with mango peach (personal choice). Was recommended by my bodybuilder trainer for my competition since it has 0 sugar & 0 carbs. Definitely recommended for people who plan to compete & follow a strict diet plan to restrict the carbs. Secondly, it is easy to mix & tastes good.4 star because it is a bit more expensive :-)"
1,"Cool product, but mine was broken",The digital display was missing some characters and made reading it almost impossible for my 8 year old. He liked the idea of it so I brought it back to the discovery store only to find they had no more left. I wasn't into paying the shipping to send it back so I exchanged it for another item. Too bad. I think the store should test its products prior to sending them out.
3,major typo,Obviously the price on this is a MAJOR typo.. $299...buyer beware you don't make a buying error as well...
3,Short western stories,"I bought this book for my brother's birthday as he is an avid western story reader.He said the stories are mostly good, but a few are ""oddly"" written and hard to follow."
3,One of our better presidents.,"I agree with some of our previous reviewers. Seigenthaler puts alot of effort into the beginning of Polk's career, but little of his actual Presidency. He goes into great detail about his early life and how he became a disciple of Andrew Jackson. The book also details the campaign and then gives his Presidency a small portion of this small book. However, the reader can learn a great deal about the first dark horse candidate for the U.S. Presidency. What Seignethaler does do is describe the early career of one of our better presidents.This is an OK read in the U.S. Presidency series. I have not read any of the others, but the armchair historian can pick up some details from this biography of a misunderstood president."
2,Boring,"I teach a freshmen information systems class and viewed the video for about 100 students, they were bored to tears...the questions in the interview were very common questions with predictable answers."
3,Maxie,"OK so Maxie isn't a blockbuster and not for every taste (what film is??) and I will admit that had the part of Nick been played by anyone other than Mandy Patinkin I would have liked it less, but I found it entertaining enough. Even when one is based on the other books and film are two different mediums and shouldn't be so closely compared. Maxie was just meant to be a bit of fun and fantasy and as such is ok."
1,The Six Million Dollar Viking,"Ok this movie is not great,is cheesy, but it might be good for some laughs and kids might like it, but unfortunately the film on the copy I have is dark,dull looking and washed out, like a lot of low budget(and higher budget) stuff from the seventies. I do not know if the film on the copy for sell here has been ""restored"" or could be."
2,Disappointing,"I love the Scary Movies. I enjoy the parodies and the exaggeration of scenes we saw on the original movies. Unfortunately Epic Movie didn't catch a glimpse of what Scary Movie has accomplished. The story is weak and although it had a lot of material to hold on, it is barely funny. The first minutes are really funny and if that could have been kept throughout the entire movie, another tale I'd be telling.I really think Epic Movie was a great idea. It could have really worked... but for me, it just didn't make it. After the first 30 minutes I was just waiting for the end. I didn't find it original or even mildly entertaining, and believe me I can really enjoy dumb movies, but for some reason, Epic Movie lacked something that could have made it better."
3,stupid but entertaining,i watched this movie roughly 3 times. i thought it was good and entertaining.yes it was beyond idiotically stupid but it was in some ways hilarious.
1,Pretty Crappy Movie,"This movie was so bad that it gave me diabetes, like seriously i got diabetes from watching the movie. Balloons!"
2,Wow This was bad and NOT Funny,"I rented this so called film the day it came out on dvd, and boy was I sorry i wasted my money, the first quarter of this dog has ZERO laughs, and the rest of the film has very few, this was not the fault of the cast which were all very good, it must have been due to the writing, directing, etc., if you are a fan of any of the cast (as I am) then you may want to rent it to see for yourself, but to actually buy this thing....well not for me, rent it and then decide for yourself, then you can see what myself and the others here are talking about., by the way I gave it a 2 stars just because of the cast, they all deserved something better than this. **EDIT** to my original review, guess i was right about this dog, people are unloading it on Amazon now at less than $1.00 which is a good sign that the movie was not good!"
1,GLAD I DID'NT SEE THIS AT THE THEATRE... I WOULD HAVE LEFT...,"First of all, if you want to see FUNNY, rent or buy Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Waiting, or Dumb and Dumber...I was flipping through channels on cable and this was on HBO or SHOWTIME and for some odd reason I tried to watch a bit of it. What's the deal with HBO showing all the 1-Star films anyhow? This is actually worse than Scary Movie 4, which I walked out of at the theater. This should be considered ""straight to DVD garbage"". Putting it on DVD at all is a crime!THERE SHOULD BE A NATIONWIDE THEATER BOYCOTT (OF THIS TYPE OF MOVIE) WHEN THE NEXT ONE OF THESE UN-INTELLIGENT LOWBROW CRAP MOVIES COMES OUT! ALL THEY DO IS COPY SCENES FROM OTHER MOVIES AND TRY TO MAKE JOKES FROM THEM. THINK OF YOUR OWN MOVIE, OR STOP MAKING THEM!HERE'S AN IDEA ""UN-FUNNY MOVIE"" OR ""STUPID MOVIE""... PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT!"
1,"If you really like movies, avoid this at any cost!!!!!!!","The worst comedy ever made with Date Movie, Superhero Movie, Meet The spartans... If you whant to see something really funny, go for any Chaplin or Monty Python movie, those are funny, not a spoof on other movies just because they don't have writters good enought to write something very original and funny. Avoid at all cost!"
1,Could have been great!,"But, wasn't.The jokes are way too obvious for even a parody movie. Despite the various actors and actresses in it having stellar roles in other films/shows. The abysmal quality of the script shines through from beginning to end."
2,LAME!!!,"I'm a big fan of the Scary Movie series. These films, especially the first, were really funny and had me laughing right off the sofa.However, my expectations for Epic Movie were clearly unfounded. Right from the start, it was clear this movie was a dull dud. Between the lame X-Men parody to the incomprehensible Willy Wonka/Candied Cannibalism skit, this movie was a rip-roaring disaster. The plot was a jumbled mess of un-funny, pseudo-parodies that leaped from one lame line to the next.I am a big fan of over-the-top humor--the kind one finds in MAD TV and the Scary Movie series. Epic Film is only a pale, flacid imitation of them--and was clearly made to get some quick cash in someone's hands."
5,sooo funny!!!!,this flick is really funny! warning this is not for GIRLS. this is more of a GUY flick. epic movie is soooo funny!!!!! its more funny than date movie but not as funny as the scary movie. epic movie is da best!!!
2,funny....enough.,"I actually found me laughing at a few parts.I thought the Mystique part was HILARIOUS.And when the black girl got shot with arrows the way she wiggled in a seizure-like way was pretty funny.The Click part was cool. Mostly cause they attacked soldiers ""from Braveheart"" while they were frozen; stuck in time.The ending with the Italian guy in the thong was classic.There were a few more laughs in between.But I wouldn't want to own this. At any price.It was good for a watch. I might tune in for a bit another time.But that's it.2 stars.end note: the overall rating couldn't be any more perfect. :)"
2,"Insanely, stupid.","Epic Movie takes a hodgepodge of good and bad movies and mixes them all together in an insanely, stupid 80 minute attempt to make people laugh. I did chuckle a little, but just a little. Overall, this movie is, well, rather stupid. In fact, it is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.(Maybe I just don't appreciate this type of humor!)"
1,Painful.,I wish I could get back the $7 I spent to see this movie in theaters. If only that same $7 could buy me a time machine so I can change fate's design and prevent myself from ever having stepped into that cinema.
5,gotta see EPIC MOVIE!,"u gotta see epic movie! its the best movie since SCARY MOVIE and DATE MOVIE! everybody's in it! jack sparrow, superman, willy wonka, paris hilton, samuael jaskon, kal penn, carmen electra, jennifer coolidage, adam champbell, click , v, micheal jaskon (ew), borat, narnia, x - men,nacho libre, harry potter, ron , hermonie, star wars , lord of the rings, an many others try to defaet the evil WHITE BITCH of gnarnia(WITH A G)lolol see it!!!!!!!!! love it!!!!!!!!!!!! get the UNRATED dvd!!!!!!!!!"
5,It's All Between the Lines,"A very heart-warming, healing therapy for anyone. A true gift to help us all use uneasy waiting time in a creative way and have something to show for it."
3,Typical Hemlock Falls Mystery,"This is a typical entry in this series. I have come to enjoy reading this series more for the events in the lives of Meg & Quill et al than for the mystery itself.In this story a master chef, hired to judge a fried food contest in Hemlock Falls, is found dead, and, as usual, there are suspects galore to sort through. And, as usual, at least one of the sisters' acquaintances is a possible suspect meaning that they must involve themselves in the mystery to save them.I rated this one 3 stars as opposed to 4 as I figured the mystery out midway through the book; otherwise, it would have been 4 stars as it was enjoyable as most of the books in this series have been for me."
4,"Good ""B"" movie","The story has been done many times before -- traumatized Vietnam veterans and their problems adjusting to life after returning home. Yes, most of the acting in the movie is below average. However, the movie is definitely worth watching because of John Phillip Law's performance. JPL is very convincing as a kind, tender and sensitive man trying to put his past war experiences behind him. It was good to see JPL projecting his depth and versitility. A must see for John Phillip Law fans!"
1,Don't go by the picture.,"I got this hub thinking that it would fit my warrior. Because the picture is identical to mine. Apparently this is for a honda and the picture isnt even close. Go by the model number, I hope someone can learn from my mistake."
5,A little realism never hurts a book...,"This book is one of my favorites, and one I can enjoy reading over and over. Yes, Niall cheats on Sabrina, but personally I like some realism in my romance - is that too much to ask?This is not a run-of-the-mill romance and readers looking for ""perfect"" protagonists and relationship are not going to enjoy it. Sabrina is not an hourglass-shaped black-haired/blue-eyed or even blond/green-eyed miss and Niall is not the dashing brooding rogue who is ironically faithful. This is what makes this book so great since in the end they both overcome their imperfections."
5,"Wonderful, gives the small breeder a beacon of light!","This book is incredible, as a new Arabian breeder, I was feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and various breed types. I've read a number of books, but overall this one instills the knowledge that even I can have an impact on this beautiful athletic horse. AND it gives me a process and insights on how to go about it. THANK YOU Bazy and Mary Jane!!!!"
5,Mr. Bumpy is Awesome,"Let's be honest, if you even know what this is, you already know it's great.Still plays great and the teens thought it was fun to see again"
4,Blue Heron Guards Fish Pond,"I bought this blue heron decoy as a gift for my brother and sister-in-law. They have a small decorative pond by their house stocked with goldfish. The heron in the area kept going after their fish. My SIL reports that since putting up the decoy, they have had NO problems whatsoever! They move the heron every few days to make it look more real. In addition to protecting the pond, this heron also looks great!"
4,A story of friends who worked quietly behind the scene,"Ilse Margaret Vogel's book about her tense final months in bombed out Berlin near the end of World War II is well worth reading. Unlike most WW II books detailing life experiences, Vogel captures the youth and excitement of she and her friends that even war could not diminish.Vogel's skill as a storyteller is evident as she recalls how she and her friends worked in small ways to protect or shelter those pursued by the Nazi SS. Their efforts, seemingly small, saved lives. The personalities come to life in glimpses of the risks they take and the small victories they share. Some survived, some did not. But the difference they made is significant."
5,great cleaner,My daughter is a registered gerbil breeder. This cleaner makes quick work of her/our cage cleaning efforts. It does a great job and has a pleasant smell. We particularly like it for cages that are too large to be cleaned in a regular sink/faucet manner.
5,LOVE THIS MAT,"I love this mat! I used to slip on my old mat and at the mats provided at the yoga studio I am member of. When holding poses, I'm very secure on this mat. During hot yoga it may get a *tiny* bit slippery because of sweat-- but any mat would do that. A couple of other people in class have even tested it out and ordered it too! I have had it for a few weeks now and I attend yoga between 3-5 times a week. It still has the rubber smell... I may be weird- but I like the smell."
4,Jade Harmony Good mat,"I rec'd the Jade Harmony mat for a gift from my children.My previous mat was a Giam matt & I was sliding all over the place on it.This mat is an average lenght & width so perfect for me who is 5""3.It has a slight rubber smell to it but after a few days of leaving it unrolled the smell is gone. I've used it now for several yoga classes & it works well. I still slip occassionally but that is only after I have been in downward dog for an extended length of time. I love the color. So far I haven't come across with many others having this same color mat."
5,Bought a lot of products from amazon,"Had to take a moment to comment on this mat. A practicing yogi for a few years I always relied on loner mats because they were convenient. I decided to invest in this one and (so far) couldn't be happier. I wanted sticky and got just that. Awesome. The Matt is soft and is of great quality. I felt like my practice was elevated. It does have. A faint rubber smell but actually like it. I hope it doesn't fall apart as some reviews suggested. Buy this, you won't be sorry."
4,Jade Harmony Yoga Mat,"Although I like the Jade Harmony mat, I found it to be a bit more slick than the mat I've been using for the past two years. Also provides a bit less cushioning, which could pose a problem for heads while in headstand, or for gentle knees."
3,was the best in the beginning,"The best and the most expensive mat I have used so far. It lays flat and has really good traction enabling less effort for performing asanas.**UPDATE: Jan 15, 2012**I have used this mat for 1 1/2 yrs. now. Recently, it has lost the integrity and now stretches and buckles when I do standing poses. The mat moves so much that I have to stop in the middle of the practice and re-position it. I washed the mat but didn't make a difference. I have used this mat about twice a week for 1 1/2 hrs. at a time. I am disappointed that the mat didn't last longer. For the price, I think it should have lasted longer. I will have to find another mat."
1,"Smells, Quickly Breaks Down, Color Runs, No Warranty","D. Geleva's review is right on. I'd like to add this mat started falling apart in the first year and there is no warranty. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that's the way it is and I even escalated it to the highest manager I could find.Problems include; a strong latex smell that never goes away and is difficult to remove from your hands. The colors run and stain carpeting and clothing, this does not go away. The mat starts breaking down quickly. Did I mention terrible customer service.I've since purchased a Manduka ProLite and could not be happier. And, it has a lifetime warranty."
5,Captivating from the start,"In the Missing Person, Tobin takes you on a captivating journey full of secrets and discovery. I believe this book would translate into a blockbuster hit. Definitely recommend!"
1,Perhaps the worst film of all time,"This is the only film I ever walked out of (until ""A River Runs Through It."") It's a really bad film that goes nowhere and takes forever to get there."
2,Missed the Mark,"I seem to be going in reverse order reading this series as I started with Wicked Fantasy and moved on to this title. As a whole, I enjoyed the other novel more. Story-wise, Lord of Seduction is the better tale, but romance-wise, it missed the mark. I couldn't develop a genuine interest in our couple at all. I liked Diana very much, despite others' opinions, but Thorne was a nonentity as far as I was concerned. I was bored by the romance aspect and was more eager to see where the actual story went. I haven't experienced this often at all in a love story. I will attempt another title in NJ's Paradise series and see if it suits my tastes more than LOS did."
3,Bogart Goes To China,"Humphrey Bogart stars as one of the righthand men of a Chinese warlord (played by Lee J. Cobb) who takes off from his boss and poses as missionary priest. Gene Tierney also stars as one of the workers at the mission, while E.G. Marshall and Agnes Moorhead co-star as the mission's doctor and his wife. Bogart as a priest is a little farfetched, and he never quite seems to get completely into the character. The rest of the performances are acceptable and the setting of the Chinese mission is an unusual one. It may have been more interesting if the script had further explored the growing attraction between Bogart and Tierney (who thinks he's a priest) and spent a little more time concentrating on Bogart's effect on the Chinese villagers. The movie is interesting enough, but has little impact."
5,THE Version of the Bible to read... if you can find it anymore,"The Greek to English translation is much better than say the NIV Bible version.There are very important words that have been rather sloppily translated in other versions of the Bible, but Oxford Press is the company that has been around for 400 years. They were the original printers of the King James Bible. This top team has gotten it right.The only fly in this ointment is that the book is out of print for several decades now. The used one I bought was inexpensive, and in brand new shape. I have since underlined and highlighted it all over the book. I love this translation."
4,Killer Dwarfs - 'Stand Tall' (Bullseye),"Very nice reissue of the band's 1986 debut lp on CD.The Dwarfs were,in fact one of my favorite metal bands of the '80's.Even had the thrill of catching them play live once.They put on just SUCH a fun show.The boys from up north(that's Canada,of course) showcase their brand of somewhat theatric 'pop metal'.As I recall,the guys in the band sort of always reminded me of those cool kids that you personally knew from high school.With cuts like ""Stand Tall(Stick To Your Guns)"",""Through Animal Eyes"",""Keep The Spirit Alive"" and ""Do Or Die"",I have to say that 'Stand Tall' is one of those CD's that goes by pretty quickly.It's THAT good.Should appeal to fans of Kix,Quiet Riot,Mama's Boy's and Princess Pang(anyone remember them?)."
1,They're asking how much??,"I bought this album when it first came out on vinyl. Wish I had kept better care of it, I wore it out. When I saw the asking price for ""Stand Tall"" on CD I was floored. Between $59 and $250!!!!! It was a great album but not worth the price that it's being sold for here."
3,Informative,"This book is informative, as most other reviewers point out. I only caution that he does not show any understanding of a mother's perspective, in fact in some cases he comes across as a misogynist. I only point this out because men need to be able to understand their children's mothers in order to be able to work things out amiably as co-parents, a job which does not go away after court is no longer in session. The author does a really poor job of building up the good in 'most' mothers, and all too often portrays the negative, creating an antagonistic attitude towards all mothers, not just the bad ones. He even uses words like, 'evil', etc.By all means get the book, it has lots of info, just try to keep an open and compassionate mind. Don't become the monster, even if your ex has."
1,Review by the Evil Mother,"I am the evil mother Mr. White talks about in his book. That does not mean I really am evil. It means that he listened to my soon to be X without using any kind of filter. In my X's opinion everyone that helps him is a all knowing (as my X's review demonstrates). Anyone apposed to him is evil. Mr. Whites antagonistic attitude towards mothers, labels them all as bad ones. I can't imagine this book really helped my X any more than it did me. My X will never learn not to put all your eggs in one basket. by Anonymous"
1,I expected more,I expected so much more from the reviews. I appreciate that this book showed me I was going in the right direction but It should have gone much farther.
3,Add this to your library.,"The content is good but there isn't much of it as evidenced by the 232 page count. All the standard stuff is covered. Gathering evidence is covered pretty well but you will have to go to a book store or library for more indepth material. The information is not flexable and at the same time too generalized for the reader to be able to know how to use it. It tells you what the judge wants but not how to make the unusual situations you face fit into the standard procedure. It is less than twenty bucks, might as well get it."
4,It really makes you think and it is very hard to put down,Brother in the Land is a very good book which is not for the really out going readers. It gets you right into the action almost straight away with the detenation of nucular wareheads. It is a book that reminds us the real danger of nucular wareheads.It reminds us that just because the cold war is over dosen't mean there is no danger. It shows how humans are our worst enemy.
1,NOT AS SHOWN!,"Shown is the 1966 Racing #98 Shelby Cobra 427 S/C. Silver with all racing decals.What I received was a Stock Shelby Cobra 427 S/C . Not racing model as shown. No racing decals as shown. Black hood stripes, not on racing model as shown. Not the black exhiast pipes , as shown. Not the racing wheels as shown. What I received was a totally different model.Did I mention this wasNOT as shown."
3,Super Reader,"A pretty passable, if perhaps a little less intense Conan pastiche.Here, the young barbarian works to make use of his mighty muscles and unarmed brawling, combat and wrestling skills, as well as the usual thievery and confrontation and dispatching of nefarious sorcerers.Still on the road to Shadizar, he goes."
3,Better than I thought it would be.,"This is not the story to define parodies of WWII, but if taken lightly (with no expectations of greatness) it is a valid romp through the North Africa campaign featuring a rather charming band of American battle weary troops. While trying to be the ""Airplane"" of the war genre, it falls short of gags, but the characters offer more than a device for laughs and are developed with such a deadpan earnest fashion that one cannot help but cheer as they stumble through the sand and eventually defeat some rather cartoonish Nazis (what did you expect?) by destoying their fuel dumps. Okay, its not The Battle of the Bulge, either, but if you go in hoping for a laugh or two and a good fight, you may be (passively, but) pleasantly surprized. -Evan Sayet. END"
1,What A Disaster,"John Wayne as Ambassador Townsend Harris. Now wouldn't it have been fun to be a fly on the wall at the meeting when the studio suits first suggested this casting? This film is a laugh riot, an endless series of increasingly ludicrous scenes. An absolute disaster, from beginning to end. The Duke is an 800 pound gorilla in 19th century Japan. He has to be seen to be believed."
2,The barbarian and the Geisha,The color was wonderful but---The sound faded in and out to the point the music was blasting and the voice was almost mute.Very hard to watch. Sorry.
1,"Well, this was absolute crap.","The main thing I look for in a science documentary is science, and I found a lack thereof in these films."
2,it's okay but lacking,"I have some of Luis Miguel's albums and I enjoyed them but when it comes to this classics, I prefer to listen to the originals. I respect other people's opinions but for me it just was not good enough especially from a big star like him. His interpretations lack emotion, it's like they were recorded just for the sake of recording them because they're popular tunes. ""De que manera te olvido"", he sang it with absolutely no emotion, it's so bland. Vicente Fernandez made this song famous and is probably the best interpretation, but also deserves mention is Eliseo Robles y los barbaros del Norte who's recording of ""de que manera... "" is my personal favorite. ""Un Mundo Raro"", I prefer Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and also recordings by Vicente Fernandez and Aida Cuevas. The only song on this album that I enjoyed is "" Entrega Total "" but I have the Javier Solis recording and that is so much better."
2,better as bathmat,"got a pinzon (house brand) comforter that was great, but towel is like a long, thin bath mat, can't wrap yourself in it, heavy but not soft, if you want that warm wrapped up sense while you find the bathrobe, this isn't the one"
2,Not Luxurious,I was expecting 4 Seasons Hotel plush luxuriousness from the description they were being sold under. Not even close. Returned them before use.
2,Not great and not worth $20,"I bought 4 of these (buy 3 get 1 free) when they were only $15 each - a couple of weeks ago. They just arrived and I am disappointed. Yes, they are heavy, but heavy as in a bath mat. The loops are too short and compact - making for a pretty hard nap. They aren't soft. They are smaller than all of the towels I currently own. I got the silver sage color, which on 2 lap tops and 3 PC monitors looked like it had a blue-ish hue to it - no they are just green, not blue at all and not a particularly nice green. The worst part, though, and the reason I'm sending them back is that the sewing is terrible. The finishing on the sides is way off. At $20, they should not be factory rejects.Update after a washing: color fades, too. Wow, they really suck."
2,Bath Towel,"Way too heavy. Didn't seem to be very absorbent. I wouldn't buy another one. Pretty color, but that's all I can say for it."
5,Fantastic Towels,These are fantasticly large and thick towels. We needed something large to completely wrap around us for using with an outside hot tub. These are very plush and heavy.
5,Excellent buy,"Got this as a gift for my husband, who wants a long towel of good quality cotton, and he likes it a lot. It's heavy, which is fine for him but might be an issue for a small person. The towel shed an enormous amount the first time I dried it but not in later washes. I am thinking of buying more for the rest of the family."
2,Wouldn't buy them again,"These towels are extremely heavy which you would think would make them very absorbent. That is unfortunately not the case. And because they are so heavy they take forever to dry. If I dry my hands on one in the morning, it is still damp at night. They take forever to dry in the dryer.Also, because they are so heavy, they are hard to wrap around yourself after you bathe -- they slip off. I would forgive all of this if the towels were really absorbent, but they are only so-so in that category.I would have returned them, but I love the color (plum) so I'll keep them, but I won't buy any more of them and don't recommend them."
2,not great,"Very heavy weight, but loops are very short and therefore does not dry well. Fails the fundamental test."
5,Very nice towell!,"Huge and very heavy terry cloth. Color was accurate, and it has enough size to completely wrap a full sized adult in comfort."
3,big thick towels,I like big thick towels and these were exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't believe the quality for the price and after using them for a few weeks my old towels felt so inferior that I ordered two more to replace them.
3,Not what I was looking for,"Some people may go for this kind of towel, but I personally wish I hadn't purchased them. I guess I needed some more education on towel fabrics, weights, etc. I find this set (especially the washcloths) much too thick. It makes them cumbersome to use in the shower. They don't mold well to your hand and body. Oh well, they're not the worst towels ever. Live and learn."
5,Wonderful towels!,"I was trying to find a replacement for a very old and very large towel I've had for years ... it's threadbare and torn but huge, so hard to let it go. Decided to give these a try. While they are not as wide as I would like (my old towel was 60 inches wide), the cotton is wonderfully soft and absorbent and the towels are not overly heavy. Thick, plush and cozy! I just wish I could find them in a greater width, I'd buy more!!!"
5,more like out of this world dub cronic,"In my opinion this is one of the few of the original batch of twilight ( ryan moore) that really kind of strays away from the complete dub sound he has become so famous for. Yes believe the hipe this guy is the dub master, all real instruments done by ryan himself, no sampling. Real acoustic drums, electric bass, piano, synthesiser and organ, sometimes styleaphone and light guitar. This album also is other worlds but not completelly worldy, it just has little flares of worldly sounds and texture. Thats what really makes it differnt from the rest, but still has that signature ryan dub sound. It has a verry raw organic roots dub sound king tubby style but with more changes. any fan of lee scratch perry, dub syndicate, mad professor, bill laswell, dub headers in general will love this cronic."
4,3 1/2 stars...Tells the real story of WW2...,"Aarons and Loftus did a lot of research for the controversial, but true ""Unholy Trinity"". It is a bit too dry, which is why I can only give it 3.5 stars(I rounded up). The authors show us that the Vatican helped thousands of Fascist collabarators because they thought they were choosing the ""lesser evil"". As the authors show, everyone in the West was in on it, and we all(perhaps rightfully) feared Communist Russia. The Russians though, infilterated these ""ratlines"" so many of these ""fascists"" were actually Reds. Fascinating study of the darker side of the end of World War II. The thought of so many Croatian butchers escaping justice is chilling."
4,"A new, funny, fast moving love story","I loved this one. Long distance romancing, a great hero, a wonderful villain and a beautiful woman. What more could you want? Tasmania and a faint twang of an accent. A must read."
1,Ann,"Not what I expected, tried to ue it but it's not what I was looking for and also when I returned the item i didn't get a full refund only half of what I paid. Very dissaponited."
2,"So-so DVD, Buyer Beware!!!!!","Bought this DVD specifically for the yoga and Pilates as I thought it would be a great way to strengthen and keep flexibility during my pregnancy. I am not impressed! The films look like they were filmed in the 80's or 90's thus the picture quality and sound is sub-par. Not to mention the DVD says the ONLY way to do the moves is against a flat unobstructed wall facing the TV. I do not have this in my house thus it makes doing the yoga and Pilates DVD near impossible. You also about 8 different items to perform these workouts, prior to the purchase I had a yoga/ pilates mat and some bands but I wasnt expectingto need thick horse blankets , yoga blocks, and specific pilates bands to perform the moves. I think that is absurd!!! The suprise in the set is the strength training DVD which is good, it's easy to follow and you don't need a ton of stuff to perform the exercises."
4,nice,"overall a nice dvd, I like the fact the teacher modifys the excersises for different stages of pregnancythe stretching/ relaxation yoga is my favorite!"
2,Should mention you need equipment...,"I think I would really love the DVD if the description of the item or even the outside of the DVD anywhere mentioned that you need more than just a yoga mat. You need body pillows, folded blankets, yoga blocks, and a yoga strap and MOST of the poses require these items. It really should be mentioned since it costs even more money. This was very disappointing when I put the DVD in and found out that way."
2,Would not recommend,bought for my wife these video seemed very dated and not ascetically pleasing at all it looked like they were made in the 80s not really enjoyable she tried it a couple times but did not like it so here they sit she has chosen a different yoga routine
5,Excellent,"This is a great set of DVDs. Yoga, Pilates and general fitness all in one package. It will get you through your whole pregnancy. The yoga program is especially good to help with the many issues and changes that come with pregnancy at different stages. I haven't done yoga before this, so starting it while pregnant, I appreciate the slower pace and a lot of attention to detail and comfort that's offered with the props and the instruction. My pre-pregnancy workout preference was more toward gym classes, especially cardio. The Fit & Toned program is just that, but for pregnant women. Good modifications are offered for the different stages. I haven't worked a lot with the Pilates yet, but I have done a couple routines on it and browsed though some others. It is good too."
2,Okay,It was okay. There are better yoga DVDs out there. They use props in this yoga so you'll need to purchase some more things to do it like the woman in the video.
2,very bad,doesnt sleep for a long tim and you cant do good tricks on it and the string is too long. when you pull it back up then it hurts your hand alot. your better off paying $5 more and getting the maverick. this yoyo overall is the suckiest yoyo ever and i dont recommend buying it
1,I CANNOT BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS CRAP!,"bad comments about this product are correct.trust me you will hate this so much and end up returning it.radio doesn't stay tunned, phone gave me ""out of range"" signal all the time even if i was right next to the base unit."
2,"Great Features, Poor Quality","This product has all the bells and whistles, except maybe digital tuning for the radio, but the quality is poor. On the first one we got we couldn't read the display on the phone no matter how we adjusted the contrast. Everything else worked fine. We exchanged it for another, and this one's phone kept losing the dial tone. Per the instructions we unplugged it and removed the battery to reset it. It would work for a while then do it again. In my experience, it worked okay if you don't need the phone."
1,Bad phone!,"The phone never worked well, and today it just stopped working. You pick it up and there is only noise. No line, just noise. It was never a good phone and it has only being used a little over a year, it's useless now."
5,best book by osho dectating himself.,"Simply the book i've loved the most. One who loves osho very much like me,would love to read this book."
4,Classic ...,"Classic ... 'cuz it was the first of a classic line up! Heard Johnie Lang sing ""Too Many Rainy Days?"" Well, this is where he got it. Bruce McCabe with Charlie Bingham and his signature Telecaster sound. This is a great album and Minneapolis locals have been doin' the Hoopsnake Roll for a long time. Classic, danceable rockin' blues."
1,Wrong Region,Be careful to pay attention th the region. I ordered this movie in haste and it was Region 2.
5,excellent,"comfortable and strange looking, which is a good thing. nice color, can wear these every day."
5,Language Police,"This book is full of facts (frankly, amazing facts) that clearly show censorship is alive and well in the world of textbook printing and it's affecting our children and their world view. The censors in this case are the intellectual elite, who feel that our children need their censorship to learn in an unbiased manner. The problem is that, in their goal of shaping society, they ignore reality. Many of us would prefer our children to have the facts, as unattractive as they might be in some cases.Ravitch's book is measured, non-emotional, and full of facts so no matter what your political point of view, you can examine this issue fully youself."
1,Low quality coffe,"I roasted this beans full city, next batch full city+,and French, no oil at all.All batches of coffee tasted flat, bitter, no aroma.Roasted the Colombia Quinchia, the Mexico Chiapas, same thing.This beans must be of very low quality. I certainly won't be ordering from them again."
5,WOW,I bought the Dave Barnes CD when it came out on Awarestore.com and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It is a CD that you can listen to all the way through and impress your friends with a ridiculously good new artist. One of my favorites from this year!
3,Not Sure Yet....,I purchased this and used it for one cycle. 13 days really...I believe I missed a day. During this time (pre-period) I didnt experience any improvement in sleep quality nor in acne breakouts (which generally bother me before my period begins. I am not entirely sure WHAT benefits I experienced. I chose to skip this cycle and will re-start next month as I travelled and missed the start date (after ovulation) to use it for December. The scent is ok. Nothing perfumey really...infact...it smells a bit medicinal but it fades away in less than 10mins. (For reference: Am 30. Not menopausal at all. Have a regular cycle. Chose to try this to balance hormones to seek clearer skin...naturally.)
2,Afraid to use this....,After reading the disclaimer that it is known to cause cancer. Haven't used it yet because I'm too afraid!!
4,Pro-Gest works for me,"Emerita Pro-Gest has helped me end night sweats and PMS, so I really appreciate this. I use it for the last two weeks of my cycle (and my partner helps me remember to use it, as it makes his life much better, too). I've tried other brands of progesterone cream, which did not work as well. Limiting caffeine helps, too, but is much more difficult to do.I did get my saliva tested, through a mail-order laboratory in North Carolina, to make sure that the night sweats are due to low progesterone. It is great to be able to take care of this myself, as doctors only prescribed the Pill, which did not work well at all, and had side effects for me."
5,Relief!,"... the night sweats came first and increased in intensity over several months. Then the hot flashes took over my days starting mildly and building to a miserable 2-4 minute inferno every hour on the hour! I've always tried to use organic remedies for anything health related. But, after the hottest and most miserable summer of my life (2010 in Oklahoma) I was willing to do anything. After much research I decided that my progesterone level was low so I purchased this product as a natural remedy. It was worth a try before submitting to HRT. AMAZING! For me, within 2 days I saw results. Within 3 days there were no more night sweats and zero hot flashes. I've taken it for the suggested 21 days and I'm 1/2 way into my 7-day 'without' period. My symptoms have not returned but even if they don't I will begin using the cream again when my 7 days are up. I'm 52 years old, healthy, and active. I'm beginning to feel like myself again! :)"
5,Emerita- Pro-Gest Cream Saved My Life!!!,"I have been using this cream for just over a month now, but I am feeling FANTASTIC!!! My last menstrual cycle was without the heavy bleeding, extreme pain, bloating, and mood swings that were getting worse by the month! After being diagnosed with PMDD in 2006, I'd switched doctors twice because all I was being told was ""get a hysterectomy"", ""get an endometrial ablation"", or ""Mirena or birth control is your best non-surgical option"". How ridiculous! These doctors can't be trusted! They're being bullied by insurance companies to keep you coming back! Emerita saved me! It is a quality product that is easy to use and gave me results almost immediately. I love Emerita!"
1,Contains Phenoxyethanol - Causes Cerebral & Peripheral Nervous System Damage,"I was looking for an organic wild yam cream and saw this product - noticed that they advertised ""paraben free.""Please research the ingredient that is often used as a replacement for parabens, ""Phenoxyethanol.""[...]Please do not use this cream with such a toxic ingredient!I just found out about Phenoxyethanol and its toxicity, looked through my Kiss My Face, Alba, and Jason (all same company) lotions, soaps, deodorant, etc., and found that they all have Phenoxyethanol. Not only did I contact the company and inform them that I will use those products again when they have removed Phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycine ([...]), but that I threw away all of their products in my home as they all contain these horrific toxins, and that I was going to tell everyone I know, globally, about what I found out, to help them better protect themselves.I wish each of you reading this well.Shell"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This stuff works perfectly! When I use it my peri-menopausal symptoms disappear and when I forget to use it they come back. Then, I am quickly reminded to use it again and when I do my symptoms are quickly relieved again. :-) Furthermore, I paid double this price at the health food store :-("
1,Cannot use,I know this stuff does work when you first use it but after continued use it is to much hormone overload for me. I did take the days off from it and when I stopped the use I was only using a small pea size. I am in menopause.
3,"Did no good, but did no harm either","My progesterone level has been off for several years, so I thought I'd give this a try even though I couldn't find any decent scientific studies supporting it. As I figured, it did me no good, but it seems to help some people and did me no harm, so I'll give it a 3."
2,Little more than javadoc,"This book focuses on commenting code in a structured language which can be parsed into documentation, an idea which has gained great popularity with the distribution of JavaDoc for java comments. There are various essays concerning structured programming and a detailed description of CWeb, an early JavaDoc-like system. I bought this book hoping for a guide to writing readable structured code and formalizing comment semantics, but those problems are not addressed in this text."
1,Ugh,"This is the sort of review that I hate to write. I'm not a great writer so I hesitate to criticize anyone's work...but it must be done.This book is simplistic. The reader can easily see that it was written in the mid-80s, before content and quality became necessary in top-notch fantasy. Saberhagen takes different fantasy concepts, throws them into a blender and out comes the story.The biggest mistake is using a straight-forward narrative style. Saberhagen uses no more than 2 to 3 lines of dialogue per page. He covers immense amounts of action with only a few lines..completely removing any drama that could have been there.Additionally, the first 20 pages had some of the most atrocious grammer I've ever seen. Saberhagen liberally used the passive tense and sprinkled the pages with fragments and run-on sentences (I hate to point out the last two because I believe an author has the right to put them into his own work) To his credit, the book gets better. But it's still an inferior work."
1,Steroid Bible? I doubt it!,"This is a pamphlet, not a book and aside from amateurish binding, there is no significant information of interest inside. The Steroid Bible could be forgiven if it's content was extraordinary but that is not the case. Mr. Gallaway appears to have little depth of understanding of his subject matter and has priced his product exhorbitantly. This book is a waste of time and money."
1,A serious let down...,"I ordered this book to try to gain some insight about steroids and to aid my decision about trying them. I was so disappointed with this book I wanted to hurl. It's about a quarter inch thick, looks like it was printed at home on a bubble jet and bound with a cheap spiral thing. The information inside is brief and goes into no detail. The majority of the book is ""testimonials"" from supposed users. The grammar, punctuation and even the spelling were horrible, I felt like it was just a published version of some High School steroid report done the night before it was due. Very incoherent, in the testimonial section, there are no bullets or numbers or anything to distinguish where each new testimonial begins. There is absolutely nothing impressive about this book, no pictures, nothing!"
1,Boring,"The worst steroid book I've ever purchased. Back to grammer school we go!!!!! When I purchase a Book for information purposes, I want information. Not Advertisement information about steroid alternatives. What a waste of money!"
5,A Great Book!,"It covers more ways to take steroids than I knew were possible. Plus, steroid user share the results they achieved after using a variety of dosages, stacks, and cycles."
1,Complete WASTE!,"I think the guys who sell the book must be writing all the good reviews for it. This book is horrible. It is a small photocopied pamphlet, not even worth the .10 they probably paid to print it. There are so many other better books out there, in fact you can't even call this a book. I cannot imagine that anyone who purchased it would have a single good thing to say about it. I also think it is funny that all the reviews are either one star or five. Clearly a dishonest bunch of guys working to make money. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Burn your cash instead if you must."
3,Not bad for the beginner,"I was a little dissapointed with the overall format of the book. Especially the less than impressive binder like cover. But, the book does cover some essential topics and is in a fairly easy to read layout. I was hoping for a little more technical information, but once again, good for the beginner but not for those with moderate understanding of steroids. Save your money and search the Internet for the same information."
1,Supplement Advertizement (NOT A BOOK) (A GIMMIK),"This ""book"" was writen as an advertizement for Growth Factor-1 a supplement produced by belle international. Ther is some information about anabolic steroids but is not specific or informative. The only reason this was written was to sell Growth Factor-1. BEWARE"
4,Beautiful and sturdy,"I bought this stand for my mom as a base for an asian-style vase. Unfortunately, it was the wrong size and she is using it for something else entirely. I honestly don't know which product description was wrong (the vase or the stand) or if it was a mis-order, but the one that showed up was way too large.Having said that, she loves the stand. It is beautiful and very stable. If I could make sure I had the right size, I would absolutely order one again."
3,Good reference for names and trades,"as an amateur genealoger and volunteer translator I find Ernst Thode's dictionary very helpful in being as accurate as possible with my translations,since he has thousands of specialty words not found in ordinary German-english dictionaries. It's major drawback is that it is a one way street, no english-german. the German alpahabet script guide is also useful, although it would have been much more so if the printing had a much higher resolution."
3,Not for North America,"It should be noted that this book is geared toward the sport as practiced in Britain. If you are considering Falconry in North America, you should consider other books as the laws vary considerably. I wish this had been noted in the description, as I had to return this book."
2,Disappointing,"This book was hard to get into, although I wanted to see where it was going. I was disappointed with the main character, I wanted him to find some sort of redemption in the end, but he did not. I felt the book just ended with little conclusion. I felt sad and disappointed when it was over. I also thought the main character was very disrespectful to women and thought little of anyone other than himself. He could have created change for people, but he only thought of himself. Also none of the women had much depth. I did learn a lot about Constantinople in that time period, which was interesting."
2,A Disappointment After Sacred Hunger,"I loved Sacred Hunger. Like that book, this one is told in 2 parts, with 2 very distinct stories. Alas, both of the stories here are odd and disjointed. Neither works that well separately, and they don't work well together. Not to say that there aren't some good moments in this book. But nothing to rival what Unsworth offers in his masterpiece."
2,One bad apple.,"The bad apple is background hiss. The only way to not hear it, is to turn up the music so loud as to drown it out. During quieter parts of songs, it's loud enough to be extremely annoying. I know the hissing is not inherent to MP3s, because my old Nomad was crystal clear.Intel got everything right except the basic amplifier. (I could care less about the radio.)What a disappointment! The one problem was the reason I returned it, and reason enough not to have purchased it in the first place."
4,Good product but suspect build quality,"I have no complaints about the product in terms of memory or music quality. BUT there are some build issues Intel should take a look at. I bought the product a year ago and since then the volume up switch has broken and so has the line out jack. The button is buffered to prevent the on circiut switch being pushed in too far but this was no enought to prevent it breaking. Also, the one of the solder connectors on the line out has broken:I suspect the connectors are taking too much of the pressure. Luckily for me, I have access to an electronic lab where I repaired both problems. To their credit, Intel offered to replace the faulty switch even when the guarantee had expired by a few days. Since I had already covered a it with epoxy, I declined!"
3,great buy - terrible headphones,"I would recommend this product to anybody who is looking to store a good amount of mp3 files. It has a geat sound quality, but unfortunately you would not notice it with the headphones that come with the unit. I was disappointed at first because the quality was terrible, but then i changed to..pair of headphones and I noticed the difference. I don't know what the matter is with those headphones, but the voices seem distant, and the music doesn't seem to carry. Once you replace the headphones it is an excellent player. I do wish it had a recording feature for voice, but i guess we can't have it all."
5,This player rocks!,"This player has 128MB of flash, double what all other players currently offer. It has two great software programs to help rip and transfer your music to the player. The design is modern and the LCD screen tells you everything. Stop looking for an mp3 player and buy this one, it's awesome!"
1,"Bad quality, worse service","FM reception was poor from the beginning. After two days of use the tuning/selection wheel broke, apparently a common occurrence. Intel would not replace the unit. Their service dept has a lot of curios policies, mostly to give customers a runaround."
3,Not as good as I thought...,"I have read rave reviews about this player, so I had high expectations. For the positive side, the player itself has a good feel in your hand and appears sturdy. The button design is also well thought out. It is easy to control this player while jogging without looking. The player also has easy to use software and you can quickly download songs without effort. However, after using the pocket concert for a few weeks I have several reservations about it. First, there is a background hissing which is quite apparent with soft music. I have used multiple headphones with the same result. Part of the reason for using MP3's is a clear near-CD sound. Unfortunately, the hissing makes the songs sound like you are using a walkman. Another negative is the cost/value of this player. Rechargable batteries and cradle are not included with this player. Because of the lack of sound quality and accessories, I can not recommend this product."
2,Headphone Jack is poor,"I used this product for about six (6) months and then experienced a problem that has yet to be resolved. The headphone jack must have an internal short because it plays through one of the two earpieces frequently. This product was great for awhile, but this problem caused me to give it two stars and to buy another brand."
2,Too fragile for the cost,"I really like this MP3 player until I accidentally dropped it. The player was in its case when I dropped it a couple of feet getting out of my car. Not much of a drop and I thought it was OK until I tried to raise the volume and it would not go up. The volume would go down, so now I have an MP3 player that works except the volume is at 0. Intel does not warranty its switches and buttons but they will generously (ha, ha) replace my MP3 player for $75. I should spend my money on a cheaper MP3 player that won't be so expensive to replace if it gets dropped again."
4,This product is great !,"I recently purchased this mp3 player and i am very happy with it. The LCD screen is very easy to read, and its easy to find my songs (even though you cant put THAT many on it) with the scroll on the right side of the pocket concert. If you move around a lot like i do, this is for you. Just be sure to visit the computer a lot to refresh your inventory. And if you get a little tired of the songs on your pocket concert, you can always listen to the radio, it has 10 preset stations for your liking. The battery life is great, and it only calls for two triple A's. Like all great things, there are some glitches, actually I only found 2: again the space is relatively small, and you cant add space onto the pocket concert like you can with, say, the rio 800. The sound quality is excellent. It is extremely light and compact, portable as hell, with its little belt clip. I would have rated this mp3 player 4 1/2 but, what can you do?"
2,The dead wouldn't bother!,"I have got to agree with the reviewer that said for fans only! And would like to add RABID FANS ONLY! I thought the band would be cool from their appearance in the movie strangeland. DVD had 2 very amateurish mtv style videos of ""In league"" and ""Love stinks"". The rest is video taken from fans in live concerts...yes that good of quality. In the studio with a camcorder. Nothing interesting there. And a few interviews. Live the Band looked like hip hop singers with the amazing gimmick of wearing ski masks (WTF?). Overall, a very embarrassing effort for this DVD. My advice is, Rent Slipknot and stick with some real winners."
2,Not nearly as good as the original Hackers soundtrack,"I meant to purchase the original soundtrack, but accidentally selected this one instead.Very disappointing. I'll probably just throw it away."
5,NEEDS TO COME OUT ON DVD!!!!,Love love love this movie. Havent seen it in a few years as it has not been on. They REALLLLLY need to release it on DVD asap!!!!
5,The Christmas List,The is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is right up there with the Year Without a Santa Claus and A Christmas Story. I need to have it on video. My 18 year old daughter and I watch it every year since it came out. It is getting harder and harder every year to catch it on tv though. This is one of those movies that only gets better every time you watch it. Great family night movie! Can't wait to buy it when it gets released.
3,Suspense builds to scary last 20 min,The begging was slow and I was thinking were the critics right about this movie. But the critics were wrong the movie is a good scary movie. The film start's off slow and the phone ringing kinda get on your nerves but anyone who has babysate and have been home alone and herd noises will relate to this movie which makes it good. The film builds it's supense till the alst 20 minutes and then it's scary. The stranger gets really creppy espesially when the main girl tries to escape the house and all the stuff he dose to keep her in is really creepy. While watching it and we here the noises in the house we relate to her and we fell the suspense and then when she all alone with no help we relate to her. The acting is not the greatest I find the girl could have done lots more to get out of the house and do more to get the stranger. The film builds on suspense which is good which makes it a good movie sadely the film is rated pg-13 so it cant show lots of scars and gore.
1,"Good for Home Decorating Ideas, that's about all",It is real easy to sum up this remake of the genuinely tense 1979 classic.It is worth the $3.99 I paid to see it on Pay Per View for the Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house. That house is all there is to redeem this garbage.I gave this one star only because I there is no option for no or negative stars which this deserved.Save your money and buy the original.
1,If you enjoy looking at nice houses than this movie is for you.,"Only thing good about this movie and probably the most money spent to make this movie is either buying or renting the house in the movie that probably belongs to britney spears. Only reason I mention her is because the guy keeps saying ""have you checked the children?"""
2,Somebody answer the phone!,A girl with bushy eyebrows takes a babysitting job in a mansion in the middle of nowhere and is stalked by a lunatic. She calls the cops and they find the call is coming from inside the house. The build up to the action took to long and the ending was lame.
4,not so bad,"this movie wasnt so bad, if you wanna have some good time for a night, you should rent it... it's worth a rent...if you wanna make your friends jump this is a great movie for it..."
2,2 stars for the movie 5 stars for the house,"This movie was OK, not great...not particularly scary. Having said that, the great thing about this movie was the awesome shots of the huge Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house. What cool architecture! You know your livin' good ,when your living room as an enclosed garden with a huge koy pond in the middle!"
3,ehh fair,"welll......this movie was not that great. That's why i only gave it 3 stars... But it was one of the better movies i've seen in awhile. It wasn't scary.... I jumped at only about 2 parts the whole movie... The actin is fairly good. Its worth renting, but not buying."
2,Pass,"I've heard nothing but rave reviews for Grossman's teaching skills and really wanted to start adding fingerpicking blues to my arsenal...and so I went for it.I actually picked up all three volumes of ""Country Blues Guitar"" and went through them slowly...well...telling someone, ""Just look at what he did there"" after watching an antique piece of footage doesn't cut it for teaching.And then Grossman will simply play the piece, albeit a little slower than it's played ""to help you"".You could get more teaching from a book, any book, with a CD. Sorry Grossman, I'm sure there's something out there that's great but thiswasn't it.That said, I'm still keeping this collection...why?Well, the old footage is well worth the price.I can't tell you how many times I've watched the Reverand play ""Tear these walls down"", just freakin' amazing.So, if you want to watch someone play, this is the ticket...But if you're looking to learn, this just ain't your train."
5,This red pen is SWEET!,"This red pen is SWEET! would highly recommond to someone looking for this, only downside is it could be bigger~"
4,Sufficiently Pen-like.,"I keep losing them though, which makes me have to keep buying more. I think my cat is stealing them."
2,Could Do Better,"This is an okay product, but a great value. If you need something to have ""just in case"" then this is a good option."
3,"Great points, but...",I find N.T. Wright's writing style hard to connect with. The best part of the book was the end when he gave examples of his theory in practice.
1,Printshop for MacPro,Never got it up and running. Apparently doesn't work with my new MacPro and I know it cannot be returned once opened.
3,Print Shop Mac 2.0,Not as user friendly as the older version of Print Shop Ensemble III. It would have been nice to be able to install on a second computer so I could transfer files back and forth between home and work.
2,Program will not open,"This application installed on my Intel Mac, but would not open......even after installing the current update. I've used Print Shop for Mac on an older G5 Mac, but it's worthless on the newer Intel machines."
1,What a total let-down!,"This is not even in the same league with previous versions of the PrintShop. The clip art is substandard & the text and photo tools are less effective that Paint in Microsoft. How this got called a ""professional"" upgrade is beyond me. I am highly disapointed with Broderbund for this trash under the respected name of PrintShop. The time may have come to look elsewhere (for Windows 7 users)for desktop publishing programs.DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,Desperately seeking some interest,"Policeman Robbie Brownlaw develops synesthesia after surviving a 60-foot fall. He can actually see the colors and shapes of emotions when people speak to him. The premise of this book is that the synesthesia gives Robbie a unique aid when interviewing criminals. He can `see' if they are lying or frightened or angry. Unfortunately Robbie doesn't pick up shapes and colors when people are bored. If he did, he would have introduced some action or suspense into this deadly dull novel."
2,Yawwwwwwwwn!,"I just don't understand all the positive reviews. I just couldn't get through this book. I like mysteries, and the idea of synesthesia(sp?) was very intriguing, yet, this book was a dud to me. Sorry."
3,3 stars is okay,"72:44 min playing time -> ok. Keywords: club, trance, relax, easy, smooth, soft, background, repeat, repeat, repeat. All tracks sound like each other. Nice instruments. Nice pieces of melody but simple. Not much variation. Some parts are real boring: just beats. All tracks are too long. You might like this when you like Jarre (although he and Chicane are very different). I bought the cd and don't regret it. Track 1: 2 stars. 2: 4 stars. 3: 4 stars. 4: 2 stars. 5: 1 star. 6: 4 stars. 7: 3 stars. 8: 3 stars. 9: 3 stars. 10: 3 stars. 11: 1 star. Average: 3 stars."
4,chicanes progress shows brilliantly,"after listening to behind the sun a few times i became hooked on chicane, i bought this cd after searching for quite some time and it is not a dissapointment, i think behind the sun might be a teeny bit better but both are incredible and worth having"
1,Panning MS Kids Creative Writer 2,"This program does not begin to compare with MS creative writer 1. That one ( which is not available any more) had lots more things to do in it. You could make many shapes with the words, add sounds and pictures to your pages. It was easy to navigate. This one (Creative Writer 2) has only about 10% of the abilities of the first one. The directions are not easy to follow and the defaults cannot be erased."
5,Let's See How Many Other Bands We Can Compare Vex Red To...,"I just recently discovered this band. I have read numerous reviews and comments on this cd, and everyone insists on comparing them with other bands. It just gets ridiculous, so far I have heard: Bush, Silverchair, Stabbing Westward, Radiohead, Placebo, Deadsy, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Nirvana, Finger Eleven, Tool, Janes Addiction, Rival Schools, The Strokes, Nine Inch Nails, Lost Prophets, and many others I can't even remember. The thing is all the above acts stand on their own, with their own totally different sounds/styles. Vex Red does as well. They have created their own sound, and done so perfectly. Every artist will have similarities/influences from other artists, and there is nothing wrong with that. Vex Red are obviously influenced by a wide range of acts, and their product is a unique and refreshing record. It is well produced, well written, and an all around amazing record to buy."
4,good creature feature,Enjoyable low budget creature feature. A few old cars and a parking garage and voila! a movie. Very surprised by this movie - not expecting much but I liked the premise of creatures hunting in the form of cars. If you like monsters get this movie.
2,christine was better,"i liked the idea of this movie, especially the cars used, but what really killed it for me was the acting. then again what can u expect from a b movie. i knew what 2 expect but i had to check it out anyway. classics like christine, the car, the wraith, or duel all dealing with cars that killed was alot better. this story had potential, and i didnt hate it....but it really could hav used a tighter script. more of a rental then a buy."
4,Not As Good as Volume 1 & 2 But Still Sick!,"A good closing for a great trilogy. And though, I think its the weakest of the three books, it is still a pretty good(meaning creepy) manga. Its just that some chapters are not as scary, and borderline funny. But I guess it just adds more to the twisted situation the characters found themselves into.Without spoiling it much, *** A BIT OF SPOILERS *** the ending is Cthulhu-esque than I would want it to be *** END SPOILERS ***, and the first few chapters, if you pay attention to the story, you can pretty much have an idea how it will all play out.The bonus story - Galaxies - is hardly interesting at all, but I guess just to add pages.Overall, I still recommend this manga(if nothing else but to finish the story), with very good story/ending, and great art as usual. Its just that it doesnt have the creepy/scary factor Volume 1 and 2 have."
5,A family favorite and a great gift.,"My boys and girl remember this book fondly. The Park in the Dark is an entertaing young persons' adventure that has just enough scary but not too much. In this story the ""stuffies"" of a young child have a night time walk to the playground but ultimatley find it is too scary to be out on their own. They feel much safer at home snuggled in bed with thier young owner. My 10 year old daughter remembers tons of funniness from our read loud sessions with this book. Hope you enjoy it,"
1,Not satisfied,"I was very dissatisfied with this product. When the shoes arrived, they seemed to have been worn previously. In addition, the quality of the leather was poor and the sole of the shoes do not sit level on the ground. I thought this shoe looked like a really cute shoe at a good price online, but once I took it out of the box, I pretty much put it right back in --and returned it."
3,"not all great songs, but a great album","Simply put, Kamen's scores (the first 6) are great and are songs that don't have to go along with any movie to be enjoyed. The first track is THE highlander theme, and is very haunting and beautiful. the tracks for highlander 2 and 3 and for the most part, ""movie music"" with alot of usettling tense scoring. Didn't go for that but there are some gems within even those songs."
4,Buy this CD just for the first 6 tracks.,"Although the scores from Highlander 2-3 are good, I always find myself stopping the CD after track 6 is done. Michael Kamen is a genius when it comes to composing, as seen in Band Of Brothers and Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves. I definitely recommend this CD to all Highlander fans, and fans of great classic music alike."
3,The Young Riders,Product was in good conditions. No product damage that I have seen. Thanks for your quick response in sending this product.
5,I was really pleased by this product.,"The Young Riders DVD came faster than I thought it would. This made me very happy. Plus the added bonus of loving the show. The antics of the Kid, Cody, Lou, and all the rest of the characters make me laugh. If you love the west, and don't care about historical accuracy then you or a loved one will really enjoy this DVD as much as I have."
2,shadow faces,"unfortunately for me it's very hard to understand their words, (especially teaspoon's) and their faces are a lot in the shadows, either by their hats or have poor illumination.(it doesn't have subtitles for the deaf)Still, there are shots, horse races, and Ike's ""talking"""
5,a great series,I do remember watching this series. It was great. One of my favorite characters was Ike McSwain. I hope they put out the second and third seasons soon. That would be great. This show deserves all the credit it can get.
4,WORKS VERY WELL,"This is a great product. Anyone with an older model tv with a coaxial cable output needs a RF Modulator to conect a DVD player, game console or any other device without a coaxial cable output. my BELKIN RF Modulator works very well, the picture quality is good and it's very cheap. Strongly recommended."
5,Belkin RF Modulator-TV Adapter,Beautiful design-easy to install-works perfectly with older TV-sets. I bought this for an elderly women. She says she very happy with it.
5,Made a DVD player usable in my RV.,"True, I was viewing some old DVDs, but I consider the performance outstanding. Easy to install and use. Only minor disadvantage might be the availability of mono only even with stereo input. For my small TV it did not matter."
5,This Unit Rocks!!! Highly Recommended! Great Value!,"This allowed me to add a DVD player to a TV that's 20 years old in the man cave. The picture is fantastic from the DVD player! I routed the sound to my surround sound amp and it sounds great. There is a 75 ohm input and output for your cable service. It auto senses when a video device is connected to the video input, i.e. DVD, and switched to that input automatically when the device is on.Highly recommend!!"
3,Ehhhh,"not so great, works okay but just barely, kinda cheaply made, but I guess you get what you paid for"
4,Helps explain family systems theory and alcohol treatment,"Steinglass' work is an excellent example of how Murray Bowen's family systems theory can be applied to the need to understand how alcohol becomes the central organizing princple in a family. The volume is written more for those who assist families and those in recovery, rather than the patients and family members themselves, that is, for any person in the helping professions who has a working knowledge of system's theory. Well-written, well-researched and quickly understood, it would be a good resource for anyone who deals with alcoholics, their families and adult children's issues. Again,the only drawback is that it is not for the general public but for helping agents and that is not a drawback as long as one is aware of that up front."
4,Definately worth checking out.,These are new recordings from the late 1980's. And pretty good ones at that. Greene is in terrific voice throughout. The production is top notch. The downside: No notes at all. Just a blank piece of paper. Grab this is you can find it!
5,Best Mustang book ever created!,This is the best Mustang book erver created. It features many pictures and tons of info.
5,Compelling Personal Stories,"Many of the experiences of the new Russian imigrants captured in this book read like short stories with a beginning, a middle, and a moral. Essentially all of the stories are compelling even when the character is not sympathetic. The human struggle to persevere in the modern world is no where better captured than in the experience of leaving everything you have ever known to start again in a new country. As these are contemporary stories, many resonate."
5,Each story grabs your attention in a different way.,"The ladies in this book all lead very different, but interrelated lives. Their stories, as Barbara wrote them, grabbed my attention and pulled me into their lives until she ended each one with a new twist. I had to read each story in one sitting as a new adventure. I couldn't wait to begin the next one. Her last statement in the book, ""Take along what has meaning for you now and leave the rest for another time"" sums up the feelings I was left with at the end of each story. I'm sure as I reread the book, I will find new meanings and adventures that I missed the first time. I'm looking forward to meeting more ladies of the Borobudur."
4,Toll Is Pulling It Together!,"Since I was drawn to Toll's 1st book due to my own trip to Napa area, the wine Mecca of the Left Coast, finding it (the book) enjoyable but not as humorous as I thought it could have been. But did find the plot intriguing. I pressed on with her second ""Murder Pans Out"" and was so glad I did!Her character development was much improved and I found the humor was real and charming. After all, a group of school teachers traveling together, a costume dinner party, a stressed antique dealer who is literally ""under the gun"" are surly the makings for some well deserved chuckles. And they were there. In addition, the historical information was stimulating.I will anxiously await her third installment and recommend that you don't miss making your reservations for the tour!"
2,Not A Good Mystery,"This was the second book by Emily Toll that I read.I enjoyed reading about the California Gold Country and learning about the horrific, no longer used practice of hydraulic mining. I liked the characters.However, the mystery wasn't very good. There were not enough viable suspects. Also, I figured out who the murderer was before it was disclosed. I can rarely do this. Although I enjoyed the first book more, I don't know if I'll bother to read a third."
1,the worst of all time,I couldnt even get past the first chapter without stopping for a few days before I started again. And when i did continue to read it didn't get any better. As a matter of fact it got worst. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone else. I'd rather watch mariah careys GLITTER.
2,Not one of the best,"I have loved all of EJD books, but this one was just okay. It could not wait to finish it. I really did not liek the story line. I have brought the next one and hope that it will be better. I still love you EDJ and will still buy your books but this was one of mt least favorites of all."
4,Not bad,"This was a pretty good book. It held my attention. I was expecting a little more at the end, and that was the only disappointment."
2,Worst EJD book ever,"This was the worst EJD book ever. I went out and got this book the first week it came out only to be disappointed. First off this book is totally different from all his other books (BIG DISAPPOINTMENT THERE), second the characters are severly undeveloped, third it took entirely too long for the story to unfold. Last, I didn't understand why he kept referring back to Rev Daddy and momma. That part was so unnessary he should have used that wasted space to give more insight on the main characters. And Eric how come all your books gotta have at least one person with dreads? My sister pointed that out to me and its so true, every last book he wrote has at least one person with Dreads! What's up with the dread obsession????"
3,Okay But Not EJD'S Best Work,This read was still okay considering the new fiction out there but can I say will the real Eric Jerome Dickey please stand up. After reading The Other Woman Mr. Dickey knows he has to come better than this. I was disappointed because this book dragged on. It took me a week and a half to read this book. I usually read Mr.Dickey's books in one day. The storyline was okay but very predictable. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it never did. Anyway I Am not mad better luck next time.
2,Just Okay for me too!,"I'm not necessarily a Dickey fan, but I have read several of his books and liked them okay. However, this one I didn't finish. It just didn't grasp my interest enough for me to actually WANT to read it through to the end. I too am in a bookclub, but just could not force myself to finish reading it even for that reason."
1,DROVE ME CRAZY!!!!,"I struggled with this book from page ONE- I found that strange since generally, I start an EJD novel and read it non-stop.This book took me a week and a half. I felt compelled to finish it since I had paid the full price for a newly released hardback book. It is filed with intense violence. Lie after lie coupled with MORE violence. The characters were not fully developed; I hated nearly everyone in the whole book with the exception of Sid. Who could like Lisa??? Panther telling Driver that she could be any kind of woman that he wanted her to be?? That statement alone set the women's movement back 25 years. I was ok with Rufus for a while, but come on he soon followed all the others in the book and went downhill.Where is the man that wrote Friends and Lovers, The Other Woman, and Cheaters? Is he gone forever??"
5,Driver past sin's,"Drive me crazy was the first EJD book i have ever read and now i am a fan of his. That was a great book. It had comedy, action, betrayal, and drama. I felt the pain that driver was going through. He wanted everything that was offered to him. the cars, the woman, the house, the money, everything... but it came up to the universal question, can you kill someone for it?"
4,EJD Switches Up!,"As a serious E. Dickey fan, it's good to see him switch up from books that are primarily relationship driven, and step into the realm of crime-drama. I think it was a smart move, which showcased the variance of his writing talent.Earl a.k.a. Driver was a great character who I couldn't help but love. Baby is definately and bona fide MAN to the nth degree!!!!!! And the way Dickey re-introduced, Panther from his ""Naughty or Nice"" in this story was awesome. He gave her some much needed depth and redemption. Together she and Driver made a winning combination.To sum it up, DMC is a suspenseful story of lust, betrayal, jealousy, and desperation just to name a few. It's a page turner that will keep you wondering how in the hell, Driver is going to get out of the mess he's in. Especially, since he only has 3 days to do it and the time is ticking FAST!!!!"
5,"She's ""A list"" in my book","I think having these DVD's is great since the show is not being produced any longer. It's fun and relaxing to watch these episodes again. Kathy is so so hilarious and so sharp. I love her and for anyone else who feels the same, why wouldn't you want to have this around to enjoy."
1,"misleading title, somewhat interesting-nothing dramatic","As a frequenter of exotic clubs, I read this book and was disappointed. The book is funny and somewhat interesting, but it lacks alot information. I have dated many strippers and this book does not tell it like it really is. Besides, too many questions are still left unanswered. Good thing the book was cheap."
4,good suggestions to solve the health cost problem,"Dr. Avorn write very well, so the book reads rather quickly. Dr. Avorn is a pharmcologist. The author gave vivid descriptions about how the Vioxx/Celebrex pullout happened and related to that, previous history of unworthy drugs (or drugs that have undisclosed side effects) that were on market. The author gave good solutions, including real life studies he conducted through the years, of how to improve quality of drugs and lower the cost of health care in the US. Insightful. He presents a different point of view from what I am used to hearing. Would suggest this to anyone who cares about healthcare system."
1,WHY???,"With the exception of Rammstein,this album is a complete waste of money. Whoever put this crappy compilation together took the worst songs of some decent albums (KMFDM for example). I mainly am a fan of electronica and only bought this because it was recommended as similiar to artists such as Juno Reactor, X-Dream, etc. IT IS NOT!!! Yea..It is a biased review but it would still suck even if I was a legit critic with a more open mind."
3,The film was okay. Quality was a little off possibly due to the manor it was copied.,"Quality was a little off possibly due to the manor it was copied. While entertaining, the movie's plot was convoluted in that for some reason Army nurses were worked in to the firebase, plus making it seem that the Army troops were so much less gung-ho than the Marines who arrived to save the day. In short it was a bit over exagerated and took a lot of Hollywood artistic license."
3,Ripped off,"Very poor quality. It appears to be a very distant copy of the original. Tried to complain but was told mailbox was too full. So bit the bullet and just kept it. If you watch as I have, you will learn Captain Ziggy always has just one copy left. We will not ever buy from him again and very disappointed Amazon even represenrs him."
5,an absoulute must see for war buffs,"It's a story of a small firebase in the middle of nowhere being overrun during the Vietnam War, but it goes much deeper than that. The movie brings to life the feeling of desparate terror in the hearts of soldiers facing an enemy ten times their size and having no hope of reinforcment. Running along the lines of Hamburger Hill, The Seige of Firebase Gloria is a classic in it's own right, and an integral part of this genre of movies. The cast includes a line-up familiar to war movies doing some of their best work. I would highly recommend seeing this movie to anyone who wants a glimpse of real life in time of war, there are no unstoppable superman type heroes in this flick, only a group of men trying to survive in any way they can."
1,NOT WORTH IT,This book has missing pages in multiple sections of the book.The substance of the book isn't anything to write home about either.
5,Cute and Educational,This series drove me up the wall...why? Because my 3 year old could not get enough it! Which isn't always a bad thing. He was so engaged with the characters and spelled right along with them.Definitely worth a try for your preschooler!
4,Better than it's price.,"Nice bag for it's price. Has a lot of compartments, and pretty decent padding. Best priced 17"" Laptop messenger bag. Though no messenger would ever use this bag."
5,Fits with room to give,"Well, my gift was for a UT fan so the orange inside was wonderful. It really does make it easier to find things when it is bright inside. The bag itself fit our dell 17"" laptop with room to spare. Many pockets to carry extra accessories and paperwork too. It has been almost a year and the strap is still intact, no fraying, durable and easy to clean. Will definitely purchase again."
1,"Debunking ""America We Will Never Forget""","The footage in ""America We Will Never Forget"" is presented in the order of a timeline for the day of 9/11/01. I was curious how they would present the ""collapse"" of the 3rd tower to come down that day, WTC #7 (World Trade Tower 7, or, The Salomon Brothers Building) which mimicked a controlled demolition at 5:20pm, some 8 hours after the plane strikes. The segment began at 5pm exactly in this documentary and amazingly enough.....skipped over the 3rd largest structural failure in world history (the first two being WTC's 1 & 2) as if it never happened. Anyone who doubts me can watch and see for themselves. So? The makers of ""America We Will Never Forget"" follow in the footsteps of the 9/11 commission, which in its' 500+ pages ALSO neglect to mention the destruction of this building. The BBC had NO problem mentioning it. In fact they reported the ""collapse"" of wtc7 a full 23 minutes BEFORE it actually came down. Google search ""BBC wtc 7"" if you doubt this."
3,"well organized, poor voice talent","I bought this for my 8 year old to improve his spelling in English. The spelling skills sections are well organized and levels can be changed, the program allows time for reactions...BUT...the character voice talent also used for some of the spelling cannot clearly pronounce the ""s"" sound, and to a lesser extent the ""t"" sound. I can't see the point of using a voice saying ""shtay"" or ""ath"" and expecting children to know that this means ""stay or ""at""."
1,Do not bother,"Looks nice on the photo. First impression when I opened the box, cheap.... I guess you get what you paid for. It worked fine for a couple of times for me and that was it. I am getting green light indication for the one pair of batteries and red light for the other. I tried all 3 sets that I have and this thing is done. Not happy...."
4,It works,"The works well. The batteries are charged quickly. The lights on it are intuitive, The slots for the AAA and AA are obvious. I use the batteries that came with it in my camera and they didn't last that long it didnt seem. I'll use them in a mouse next time around."
5,Don't pass this one up!,"Virginia Kantra created a tension-packed romantic suspense about a woman trying to escape a cult in the woods of North Carolina, and a suspended cop who helps her, to the detriment of his own agenda--saving his sister from her husband who is one of the cult leaders. This one is a page-turner. You won't be disappointed."
2,Software stinks,"Even though it says right on the box supports WinXP, the software that comes with it locks my computer up. I searched all over the internet and finally found 1 link to an upgraded version 3.0. I would assume KDS would have a link on thier site and regular updates to it, but they didnt. Really, one would think on thier site, you could upgrade the software for it. The 3.0 software does work, but its extremely slow on a 1.6 gig with 1024ddr, and 50% of the time just quits responding when you try to load it."
4,Finally - works as promised!,"Update of review below:This product now works as promised with the new software being very stable. I still think the software needs some updating for it to be more useful, but overall everything is as advertised.Just want to echo the reviews before: This could be an amazing tool for those of us with way too many cds and dvds to keep up with, but the software just doesn't work.I waited to buy this until KDS told me that new software was out that would make it work fine with XP and with other USB devices. I was given a secret link to the software, which I downloaded and installed. (Someone please tell me why the software is so secret!)The software just locks up my computer, making the whole thing useless. If they don't give me a miracle pill to fix this very soon, it is going right back to KDS.Once again, this would be a first rate product - if only it worked"
3,"Good product, flimsy mechanism","I purchased this product about 1 year ago. I also have the same problem; doesn't eject tray. I opened and found that the tray eject mechanism is motor, plastic gear and ""rubber band"". That rubber band was broken. I tried to find the replacement rubber band but it's small size and should be tough. I called custermer service for requesting the rubber band but they simply don't have any part. I looked for tough rubber band and Radio Shack has mini RC car tire! That's really tough and almost the same size but a little bit thick. Anyway, it works fine for several months. If you have this organizer, it's not too difficult to replace the rubber band and I believe the mini RC tire will never broke."
4,Good product,This product has been used by my company for over 12 years and does not need to be replaced often unless poorly cared for. Perfect fit and incredible transfer of moist heat without mess of water. Highly recommend.
4,One of my favorite buds from the 50s-60s.,"As usual, album had some cuts I wasn't interested in, or didn'tlike - BUT - I'd buy it again. Darrin's always acceptable.You know, somebody said our Bobbie was cast as a combat soldierin a B & W war movie: ""Hell Is For Heroes."" That was difficult tobelieve. I'll have to check that out.Buy it just for his ""Simple Song of Freedom."" The rest is gravy."
4,Aces Back to Back(Audio & DVD,"Another great purchase for any fans, of the fiftys & sixties teen movies and romantic rock & roll teen idol's. This DVD & CD will take you back in time."
1,Old...,"This CD is from 1994. It does NOT work with Windows 2000 or XP (or Vista, I'm sure).So I haven't been able to really use it, though it did install. Then it wants 256 colors on the desktop, and gives some CD-audio errors, and acts pretty weird."
2,Mildly amusing,"Well, this is not Dostoevsky, no need to use your brains when you read this piece of work. Mildly amusing. Poorly developed charachters. The portrayal of Mr. Samsonov is way over the top,where did he dig up such a character? All in all, readable but mind numbing."
1,I bought a JUNK,"My review is simple. Don't but this mattress pad. It's costed down way too much.1. I bought a queen size of this mattress pad and it does not fit well on my Simmons NxG 100 Queen size mattress. After I centered the mattress pad on my mattress, there are about one to two inches of space at all four edges covered by the elastic sides, not mattress pad. A Simmons queen mattress pad that has smaller surface than Simmons Queen mattress is just a total rip off.2. Before I opened the package, I can already see some blue paints on the mattress pad. It looks like some body drop few drops of paint on mattress pad then rub different part of mattress pad against that part with drops of paint. it's really hard to believe this mattress pad is ""new"" as claimed by the seller on Amazon.In conclusion, my purchase of this ""new "" mattress pad is worthless. I wouldn't have spent a penny on this mattress pad.Be warned!"
4,Excellent Unit but Accessory Kit is Pricey,"After reviewing many of the MP3 players I selected Intel because it had the highest volume level, largest memory (128 meg) and an FM option. Downloads are easy and it never hangs up on large downloads. I wanted to purchase the accessory kit but I thought [it] was too much. I suspect that the price on the kits will come down when the newer models arrive on the market. Besides, the unit is fairly easy to hook your player to any audio amp without the docking station."
2,kinda flat . . .,"Since this book was part of the Fabulous Fathers Series, I had high hopes for it. Somehow, though, the characters seemed underdeveloped, low on emotion, and rather unbelievable. The child at the center of the custody battle doesn't seem real til near the middle of the story; til then she's one of those ""placeholders""--children the author puts in because the story requires a child. I actually found a minor character, lawyer Alec Barclay, much more intriguing than the hero. And that's a bad sign! And excuse me, but what judge on earth is really going to ask our heroine, in the middle of a hearing, ""Have you always loved this man?"" Really now. The obsessive grandmother's sudden emotional breakdown was a little hard to swallow too--she doesn't really come across as likely to crack under pressure. The tea-party business is cute, but . . .For a better take on the single-dad plot, try Cara Colter's ""Truly Daddy."""
5,Fun to read!,Kathy was funny in high school and she has gotten funnier! She is a modern Erma Bombeck. My husband picked up the book and started chuckling as he began to read. We need to keep a sense of humor in the midst of the chaos of family life. Kathy has a knack for putting the adventures into words that we all can relate to and laugh at. A great read for Moms (and Dads too!)who are trying to maintain their sanity through the ups and downs of everyday life in the trenches.
3,ok but not great...,"The description on the cover claims A Fully Instructional Stretching Tape. However, there is no instruction at all, just music. The models were good looking and seemed very comfortable in the doing the stretching exercises but my disappointmant was that I could not follow along without some instruction."
5,Glad I Found It Again,I LOVED this book as an upper elementary student after I lost my father very suddenly in an accident. I'm sure over the years I read this at least 10-20 times. I'm so glad to see it is still around so I can add it to my collection for my own children.
4,My 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter both love it,"My two children play this together, have a lot of fun, and come up with interesting facts about whales and dolphins. I even saw the two of them looking at a book about whales and quizzing each other on the type of whale shown in the pictures. We thought it was a good value, and it convinced me to buy more of the MSB software."
3,Third time's the charm,"RuPaul's third CD is better than her second, but not as great as her debut. This album's 14 songs have much more of a Hip Hop and R&B vibe than the other CDs' more Disco, House, and Pop flavor; but don't worry, club kids, there are plenty of House beats. It is also more of an album by RuPaul André Charles, the man, than RuPaul, the mythical drag queen matriarch. Sure, RuPaul's raps which appear on several tracks are a bit corny. Sure, some people may object to the appearance of ""Shirley Q. Liquor"" in several skits (they are quite a step-down from the late great LaWanda Page's appearances on RuPaul's debut). But the songs on here are at least as good as anything released by Ashanti, Britney Spears, or Jennifer Lopez. This album is a must-have for any RuPaul fan. Note: the CD is in a fold-out cardboard case, as opposed to the traditional jewel case. Background vocalists include Siedah Garrett."
4,"Good, but not quite great","Although WIVES AND DAUGHTERS is adapted from the wonderful but unfinished novel of Elizabeth Gaskell, and is produced by the same geniuses that produced Pride and Prejudice, it is not as vibrant nor as engaging as the Jane Austen flick. WIVES AND DAUGHTERS IS GOOD, VERY GOOD. Still, at times, it feels a bit maudalin and flat. The acting, scenery, and costumes are truly superb. A fantastic movie to watch on a rainy day. I would buy this used, not new."
4,Wives and Daughters,"I saw and read the Elizabeth Gaskell's book North and South and decided to give this DVD a try as well but prior to ordering, I went to imdb.com to see the story line and what others thought of the series.The story is about a widower and his daughter, Molly. The widower decides that he should remarry to provide his daughter with female companionship. He marries a lady who also has a daughter, Cynthia, about the same age. Molly soon goes to visit with a squire's family who has 2 sons, Osborn and Roger. The film is about the relationship of these 4 characters.Probably will see if I can get the book to fill in the details for the film."
1,Junk,"I bought these to have 'kid' lanterns in our tornado shelter. I didn't expect them to be super bright, but something the boys could play with when we had to get in there.Upon opening, one of them didn't work altogether (blue one). I put batteries in the remaining 2 to let them 'try them out'. They are real flimsy and cheap, which would be fine if they worked. Yellow one worked for a minute, then stopped working. Now I just have a red one. The price is right for 3, but definitely not for one of these cheap things. Pass on this if you actually NEED a lantern."
1,Total Junk!,"Purchased these to be prepared for the next power outage. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but these things suck! One out of three was inoperable right out of the package. Turned out to have a dead bulb or so I thought. Replaced the bulb and then it was the wiring or switch. Not sure. Took it apart just to see how it was made and it's total garbage. Had to replace one of the other lamps bulbs within an hour or two of use. The batteries get warm and they don't last long (alkalines too)Total waste of money. Worse than a dollar store item."
1,Garbage,Stay away from this item! Cheap garbage. One never worked & the other 2 for 5 minutes total. Worthless & amazon should block this item from being sold.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We put the batteries in to check they worked before we used them camping (they were meant for one night of tent lighting, nothing more). None of the three initially worked, but we realized that the light bulbs and some of the wiring were loose, possibly from the shipping. Fixed that up, and they worked no problem for the two minutes we tested them. In fact I was really pleased with myself that we had three little working lights without having to spend a fortune. We took great care to make sure they were protected in the car, that they didn't move around a lot, since it was clear that other reviewers were right about them not being very sturdy. But despite all of that, they never worked again. And we tried everything we could think of to fix them. That'll teach me for going with economy over quality. Do yourself a favor: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Junk,"Junk, cheap, broken, made in China trash. I would not recommend it to anyone. Use a match instead. I did return them but what poor quality they are. I was kind of in shock when they arrived and were so cheaply made."
2,2 of 3 did not work,item showed up quick even tho it was xmas timethese were extra add-on gifts as a result of the recent power outage and thought it be nice to have if needed againOnly 1 worked out of the box the other 2 had to be taken apart and reassembled to get the contact to touch.So now all three WERE working upon gifting these out one failed on xmas . . nice gift . . . for $10 bucks I was not expecting much but a plastic housing with a wire connected to a bulb to a battery seemed simple so $10 should have covered it since I had to supply the batter separately anyway. So one works tested today 1/10/13 one does not. The Third work when opened and was put in a closet not sure if it will light when needed.the pro is they are extremely bright when they actually to turn on - - so the working one is great
1,Terrific Until They Very Soon Stopped Working,"We had a two-day blackout. We used three of these lanterns intermittently during the first night of blackout, and we were very pleased with them. HOWEVER, one by one, they all stopped working the next day. I estimate that each lantern received 8-10 hours of usage before they stopped working. (It was NOT a battery problem.) None of the swtches physically broke, as some customers have described. We took one apart to see if there was a switch connection problem as one user said, but the switch was not the same as he described. We do not know what the problem is, so to us the lanterns are now just junk"
2,The price tells all,"If you're looking for toy lanterns for the kids, these are them. Other than that, spend some more money. These are cheap toys that work and put out a little light but that's what I expected. Flimsy, cheap, typical overseas construction so very befitting of the price. These are not camping lanterns. These make great little night lights for the kids. One of them already stopped working after a month so keep that in mind depending on what you need them for."
2,Battery operated lantern,"It is a bit difficult for me to evaluate this set of three lanterns, since only two of them worked. The third was useless. I was not particularly immpressed with these. Will use the two that do work for lanterns from my grandchildren, when they come to visit."
2,You get what you pay for ...,"I would not recommend - the lights when they worked , worked great but unfortunately they are not constructed well."
2,2 out of 3 damaged,"Received the items promptly. Looked like they were properly packaged, but two out of the three had cracks on the clear plastic rim that goes around the top of the lantern. Also one of the switches only worked in one position (they are made to work to turn on whether your turn right or left). Called Amazon, very good response with them. They immediately issued me a full credit and I sent them back at their expense. Purchased a bit higher quality ones with no problem!"
3,Requires effort to make all of them work,"One of the lamps was very difficult to get to turn on. I succeeded, but it required some work. However, these lamps are invaluable for people with smoke alarms who can't use candles."
2,"cheaply made, broke fast",this was an added side gift for the disney tent set for nieces birthday.. 1) too hard to press on/off button for two yr old fingers 2) the darn thing is made to break.. very thin plastic battery vased compartment and it broke indoors! certainly is not meant for outdoors(noway water resistant 3) may look pretty but is junk...won't last..my in law asked if i could return it the ten dollars i paid here on amzn.. certainly not worth more than 4 or 5 dollars imho..really reminds me of the dollar store. lol as for back up emergency lighting?...STAY AWAY !! BIG TIME GARBAGE! get yourself led pocket lights ..glta
2,CUTE BUT VERY FLIMSY,"I already knew that these were not sturdy by the reviews but I figured the price was right so why not, well the pros are they are cute and colorful, the kids will love them, the cons are they are very small, poorly made and flimsy, so if they are strictly for that once in a blue moon emergency they are fine, but for camping etc they wouldn't last 10 mins, and be prepared, they are just a few inches high, to me they were originally meant to be toy lanterns or disposable"
1,Bad for the environment as they wont last!,"These are cheap little lanterns, that, while appealing to ones frugal sensibilities, really should not be purchased. Why, becausethey, like all the other poorly designed and cheaply constructed products flooding out of China, will end up broken and in a landfill in way too short a time. A total waste of resources and energy (and your money really). I would recommend that instead of buying 3 crummy little disposable lanterns, pay a bit more and buy one or two good ones that will actually last a long time. Really, its better for the environment. We need to get away from buying throw away products like these, it's not sustainable. My 2 cents. Thank you.(PS: China can also make very high quality products, so I am in not disparaging their manufacturing. They make whatever there is demand for. So if there is demand for quality products that last, you can bet that is what they will be making.)"
5,CD,"Worth every damn penny, if you don't like it I'll buy it from you for $5 plus shipping :) Seriously, I'd be more then happy to let these rock-driven riffs speaks for me as presents to my friends. I don't write many reviews, but I feel compelled to write one this, one. Ethelyne - Wings is worth the cd's low price."
5,"Now that I have plugged it, can I get your autograph, M.D.?","I stumbled across Mad Dog quite by accident while learning howto use the Internet in school... I haven't laughed this hard in QUITEa while! I will probably get this hard copy for myself when I get my post graduate job.Mad Dog is consistently funny. ( ) He is a columnist in the Art Buchwald tradition, with his skewed view of life. A funny, funny guy! END"
3,Roadhouse 66,I saw this movie when first released on Video years ago and didn't mind it back than so after talking to a friend who is a car fan buys American Muscle cars and Mustangs reminded me so bought a copy of Road House 66 filmed 4/3 luckily my Blu Ray player can be adjusted so the film can be viewed on full screen & as for the sound wasn't the best but not bad than again it was made in 1984 with Willem Dafoe & Judge Reinhold and great classic cars .
1,Little ado about nothing,"Oh hey, let's all twist the past in hopes of making the case that George Soros is justified in his attempts to destroy the most successful and prosperous nation on earth. In a word, terrible."
4,Bogie,"The movies are exactly as described. Not sure if it was worth the price I paid though. I was hoping that there was a feature on the dvds to allow it to be either black and white or color , but there wasn't. Only in black and white. I saw them in color on tcm once, I thought it was great. Not sure where to find them though. The treasure of the sierra madre is one of my all time favorites. The main reason I bought the set."
4,Bogart Breakout,"This was the first of the George Raft reject parts that transformed Humphrey Bogart from James Cagney's second banana into...Bogart. The next two were ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"". In ""High Sierra"" Bogart plays a sociopath bank heister who still has a shred of humanity left, something like Frankenstein's monster but not as bulky. The character originally was stitched together from a number of Public Enemies by novelist W. R. Burnett. Bogart's performance is completely un-maudlin and genuine and like all his best work continues to last as the modern touchstone of American film acting. Another great directing job by Raoul Walsh as well, a man who could handle about anything the studio threw his way."
1,A major disappointment,"I waited in eager anticipation for this album, and I'm sorry to say it was a major disappointment. I'm admitedly more of a Jimmy Bryant fan than a Speedy West fan, so I can't really speak for the steel slide playing, but Jimmy just doesn't show the brilliance or creativity found on any of their other albums. Maybe if I'd heard their albums in reverse chronological order, I'd feel differently. Also, there are absolutely no liner notes, so I have no idea of what the story is behind this ""last time."""
5,Savanah from Ashley River Creative Arts El.,I think Chris Soenpiet's work was OUTSTANDING! The pictures nearly come to life. Molly Bannaky is one example. It was marvelous!!! The pictures were excellent and the writing was outstanding! That award was meant to be there. I like to read this book every night! My favorite part was when Molly Bannaky went on the boat to America.
3,The Day The World Broke.,"This First Class Wonderful Game Is Well Worth Buying ForWindows 95/98 Users. Its A Addictive Game Except It Doesnt Have SoGood Graphics. Its More Of A 2D Educational Game That Teachers Should Buy To Give To Thier Students In School To Play. It Helps Them Learn Numbers Reading Skills And Much Much More. Its All Worth It If You Have Kids Under The Age Of 12. I Would Reccomend It To Any GrandMother, GrandFather, Relative, Or Just Friend Of Any Child Under 12 As A Present.Good News: Educational And Fun.Bad News: Doesnt Always Run Well."
4,"Dog love it, But...","While my dog loved this bone, it was also gone in about 2 minutes flat. The 'chewy texture' allowed her to plow through it like a milkbone, not quite what I was expecting from the Nylabone brand. However, as it was cited as chewy, I can't really complain too much, ha. In any case, my dog loved this flavor, even if I won't be getting them very often. They are a bit expensive for a treat that last less than 5 minutes. However, she did climb a bookshelf to get the other one, so that does say something about how much she enjoys them..."
1,Blechhh,"I have never in my life heard ten songs by ten different bands that all sounded so alike. Listen to Avril's originals, and you'll have more variety of sound than this album can manage. Is this what punk is nowadays? It sounds to me like 10 gangs of whiny emo kids all trying to sound like Fall Out Boy (which isn't much of a goal to begin with)."
3,Good Coffee but hassle cleaning!,all in all this is a good machine. makes great coffee and taste really good but you do have to clean it every time you want a new batch of coffee. and most of the time you cant drink leftovers because the coffee in the carafe is already cold.... in order to have leftover coffee later you have to pour hot water in the carafe before making your brew and let stand for about ten minutes the pour out and make your coffee. leftovers will only last like 2 hours hot. yah other than all that the coffee is good.... already spent the money on it were going to live with it.
1,Junk,"We've had it for several years now. The grinder is useless; it grinds coffee so coarsely that you need to waste beans to make a decent pot. The big problem is that the thing regularly leaks coffee all over the counter top. I've tried everything to see if I was doing something incorrectly; darned if I can figure it out. I've finally had enough and I'm looking for a new coffee maker. In reviewing Cuisinart products on Amazon, though, I've noted that complaints about the coffee-on-the-counter thing seem to plague all Cuisinart coffee makers. BEWARE.It's just junk. And at this price, that's unacceptable."
5,Best of Stars on Ice,Undouble this is the best in Ice Skating with the incomparable Scott Hamilton & the Greatest Olympic Champions showing what can be done on Ice.
3,"Basic recipes, staple cookies, good results","All the recipes I have tried so far resulted in delicious cookies. The book offers a basic bunch of recipes for staple cookies, if you are looking for sofisticated cookies, decorated cookies, etc don't buy this book."
3,Disappointed,"I got this for a Christmas present & I was really excited! However, I was really disppointed I made the chocolate chip cookie recipe and honestly the Hersheys recipe is better. Also a lot of the recipes needed stuff that it seems would be hard to find. Not recommended too hoity toity."
1,"Could be good, if it didn't shatter.","First, it's only ONE cover, NOT a pair.It's made of fairly thick acrylic, clear and optically pretty good. Problem is, I couldn't get it onthe fog light without it shattering. Not sure I even want to attempt it after ordering another PAIR ofthem (almost $30.00 ?!?!?!) . Dang. I might just give up on this one, though I really want to protect myexpensive fog lights."
1,Not a scholarly study,"While Ellens does a good job of breaking down strict stereotypes surrounding sexuality, I've found that he unfortunately tends to make a lot of claims or assumptions that are either not backed up by Scripture or appear to be his own personal moral view. Either way, it is misleading for the reader. He claims that while sex within marriage is obviously ok, so is ""sexual communion between unmarried consenting adults within a meaningful friendship, and premarital sexuality between persons exploring the possibility of or engaged in a potential marriage contract."" (p.35) While there may be no direct biblical injunction against such sexual contact, Ellens never reveals to his readers by what evidence he has reached such conclusions."
3,book only good for text not learning,"this book has many famous poems and writings of these people, but you don't learn any real latin in here."
2,Not waterproof,"At [$$$] it was a nice little unit for the money. Had many of the critical marine aids to Puget Sound navigation built-in. Over all, performance was as represented...EXCEPT for waterproofing. Mine bit the dust after one use in the rain. Not what I'd expect from an ""M"" for ""Marine"" Magellan nautical navigation device. Never even submerged the unit (which Magellan claims it can withstand for short durations in up to three feet of water). Simply, ""waterproof"" is a severe stretch. ""Water resistant"" is even a stretch. Buy the 330M because it accomplishes the electronic wizardry you expect in a GPS unit, but also bear in mind that in the rain it will need to be operated in a plastic Ziploc bag."
4,Take this song and love it,"This is the single version of the Geezinslaws song ""I Wish I Had a Job To Shove"". The track listing for the CD listed above is for thealbum version. The single version only features two versions of ""I Wish I Had a Job To Shove"" (the original version and a six minute dance mix). Either way, it's a pretty funny song. It's sort of a parody of ""Take This Job and Shove It"". Recommended to fans of country comedy."
1,billy99 is lying....unless you were dumb enough to buy this.,"yes, of course he's lying. why the hell this is even listed on this site is beyond me....damn AOLers, always spreading rumors and asking where to find mp3's"
5,Get In on the Ground Floor,"Stated simply, this album rocks. It also jazzes, progs, sambas, waltzes, klezmers, folks, polkas, country and westerns, and bossanovas. These guys move between musical styles seamlessly.Because it is impossible to describe the sounds on this recording, I will just say that if you like Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Pixies, Frank Black, Primus, Queen, Beck, The Beatles, Mr. Bungle, Ween, Talking Heads, Rush, or David Bowie, you will realize after hearing Quantum Immortality that they are all crap by comparison. Well, maybe that's a little harsh.Let's just say that if you actually like to listen to music, you will like this album.GET IT NOW THAT'S AN ORDER!"
4,it wasn't as good as i expected it would be...,"while reading, there were some parts in the books that was really interesting, so interesting that i couldn't get my hands off of, but there were some parts where it was kind of boring. i personally didnt like the ending of the book... but overall, it was pretty good!"
1,Disappointment!,"This was the first book I've read by this author and I won't waste my time reading another. The story started out with great promise but as the main character self-destructs, the plot gets more shallow by the chapter. There was no ending; it seems as though Mr. Sheldon lost interest and just quit writing. Since it was a Kindle freebie, I didn't expect much and I wasn't surprised that I didn't get much!"
4,Great book,I just started reading Sheldon's books and must say that this is a great book. I liked the characters. I wish the story kept going and that they'd be a sequel. I'm going to try to find the movie.
2,A Torture,"Sidney Sheldon is not an author I enjoy reading and this book was pure torture, if I needed real life, I could read the newspapers, I expected something a bit better."
1,Very disappointing book !,"I agree with those who said the author just got tired of writing at the end so he just quit. Very anticlimatic and disappointing. I felt like I'd wasted a lot of time by reading the whole thing.The book reads like cheap fiction, but it didn't 'have' to. The author shows his talent in parts of the book, but for some reason he just couldn't get it all together. Almost nothing in the book turns out the way you'd like to see it turn out. It was just weird, and again...very disappointing.I won't be wasting my time reading any more of his books."
5,Hmm lost love,Picked this up when it was free for Kindle. I had read this years ago. I loved the story and the lost love of Adam was something I could relate to. Really a good read.
4,Nice Book,"This is a well presented overview of the World of Greyhawk. It contains brief descriptions of countries, history and geography. This is a good example for Dungeon Masters who want to create their own world. I was a bit disappointed because the map included was not the same as the one shown on the front cover."
4,I love this Bag,"This bag fits my 17.3"" laptop great, it won't move when in the slot. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is becuase the bottom needs to be expandalbe to put more stuff in the bad."
2,Not so good..... not easy to handle and very uncomfortable,This bag looks lot better that it really is.The inside look and feel cheap. Hard to organise because the inside divisions are small. It is very hard to handle when you whant to get something from the main divisions. The key chain holder from the picture is missing.I don' t recommend it.
3,Affordable but you get what you pay for,"I gave this book a try and didn't get anywhere. Maybe ok if you've good a background in classical languages or Indian tongues. The printing quality is poor and makes reading more difficult. I would urge anyone interested in the language, particularly those working alone, to spend the money on Walter H. Maurer's texts. Much more support for the newcomer, clear text, excellent reading exercises, and a support text with all paradigms and other assorted good things."
1,This book is great if you have a Phd in linguistics!,"This book is probably a great book if you a have a firm backround in lingustics, but it is hardly a ""beginers book"". Its introduction to the script is also very confusing. I am going to exchange this book for Thomas Egenes book, everyone seems to say that it is much more suited for the beginer."
3,"Great Art Appreciation, Bad History","Though Mr. Willis clearly read everything there was to read about Venice and saw nearly every work of art to be found in that city of splendor, ultimately his effort comes up short. His historical analysis drew too heavily on overwrought, far fetched intrepretations of art. An entertaining piece on Venetian art history; a bad attempt at historical insight."
5,Best kids show around,"We stumbled on this on PBS, and my 2-year old absolutely loves it. I even like to watch it--it's pretty funny. I can't say how glad I am to see DVDs of this show coming out since I can't get it on demand!"
3,"A Requirement for Future Appraisers, Yes, BUT......","If you are planning on taking your local state appraiser's exam, you no doubt will be required to purchase this text. It is, for better or worse, a ""standard"" in the industry. Unfortunately, as a professional educator with 17 years college teaching experience, I can honestly say that this book is incredibly verbose, repetitive, and badly organized. This 600+ page tome could EASILY be reduced by 50% (or more) without losing ANY necessary/vital information. If you have ever had to read a book on managment or education, then you KNOW what I am saying here. For published works on real estate appraisal that are concise, to-the-point, and not mind-numbingly boring, look elsewhere........"
2,Not much of a scent,"This product smells great in the bottle, but if you use the amount in the directions then it is hardly noticeable and I would say you wouldn't notice it unless you knew it was in the machine and really tried to discern it. Perhaps if you dumped the whole bottle in a quart of fog juice then it might do something. If that is the case then they should adjust the instructions. The other problem I may have had is that the space I was using the machine in was large; maybe in a small room the effect would be different."
3,Great Introductory Book,"This book is quite good. It will really teach you the basics of Finite element Method. But one problem i encountered is that if you use this book to learn, the next time you need to study deeper FEM, you will have a hard time understanding the very different approaches and also notation. But still this book will give you many things you need to know."
5,One of the Best Textbooks in FE,"Not only was I introduced to the infinite world of Finite Elements through this book, but I have also used it in the FE class I teach at UCSD. I have found the variational formulations approach most helpful as it fits anyone in the various disciplines of engineering and applied mathematics. ""Give me the field equation and I shall develop the FE model"" is the motto I have used to build a career in FE; and Dr. Reddy's Book was certainly the cornerstone. OK..I am biased...Dr. Reddy was my doctoral advisior; he is the best in the business.Samuel Kinde Kassegne, PhD, PE - San Diego, California"
1,Broke within 3 days,"As others have noted the keyboard port on this unit fails almost immediately. In my case it failed within days. One reviewer identified the problem as a faulty usb to ps2 converter, so I bought it hoping he was correct. Unfortunately after using 3 different usb only keyboards its pretty clear the kvm switch is the problem. This is the first product I have ever returned to Amazon and I will be staying away from anything Iogear makes from here on out."
1,Failure to Communicate,"I just bought and will promptly return the GCS632U KVM. The device does not work with some (most?) multi-function USB keyboards... that's what support@iogear told me. Well who knew? It's not on the packaging! In fact, the ""Features"" list on the package states ""USB sniffing technology allows complete USB mouse and keyboard emulation..."" That seems overstated at best and certainly a little disingenuous. I have a relatively simple Logitech ""Inertnet Navigator"" keyboard and the KVM would not work with the keyboard. Support told me to go buy a plain vanilla USB keyboard. Why would I want to do that just to make their KVM work? I actually use the multi-function keys on my keyboard -- duh! I'll find another vendor's product and I'll be much more circumspect when buying IOGear prodcuts in the future."
3,Distorted audio,"I use this KVM to switch between a Mac and a PC, and it has worked well except for one hiccup when it was first installed. Just be sure to plug the keyboard and mouse into their assigned USB ports. They are not interchangeable.However, the audio is distorted when run through this unit. There is a constant buzz on the speakers even when nothing is playing. This is a good KVM in general , but not if you also need to switch speakers between 2 PCs."
2,Ok when it works....,"This is my second Iogear KVM, my first being the full PS/2 version. So far I have been pretty disappointed with this KVM. It disconnects frequently, forcing you to swtich between your computers in order to re-establish the connection with your mouse. For me, this happens as frequent as every 5-10 minutes.I really wish I could go back to my old KVM, but unfortunately my new computer doesn't have PS/2 ports."
2,Does not support notebook using wireless keyboard/mouse,"Delivery was timely. Tech support was accessed quickly, was polite and quickly assessed problem. Product would not toggle between notebook and desktop PC. Tech support informed that product does not support notebook with single input device for wireless keyboard and mouse. Had to purchase separate wireless mouse."
1,Disappointing and frusterating,"This product randomly freezes up for random lenghts of time - from a few seconds to minutes, to freezing altogther where I have to unplug all devices to ""reboot"" it. It might have been helpful to put a reboot button on the device, but it happens so frequently, that would become a pain. I am using it with all new equipment purchased in 2007 running Windows XP - a standard wired USB keyboard and mouse between a laptop and desktop. Bypassing the laptop docking station does not help the problems. I have all mouse drivers updated on both machines as suggested by their support web site. I had great success and zero problems in the past with the PS2 micro KVM from IOGear, which I loved, but this USB version has real problems."
1,Definately not IOGear,"It is so unfortunate that a company like IOGear can make such a shoddy product. This is my second one, after exchanging due to problems with the first one. I continue to have the same problem with the kvm constantly loosing connection with the keyboard. Having to reach to the back of my PC and unplug the device and plug it back in again gets frustrating quick, and defeats the purpose of having the kvm in the first place. Look at other kvm's before getting this one."
1,you get what you pay for,"Too much trouble to hook up and in the end it wasn't compatable with a Mac.I went to Belkin and what a difference,I even have a remote switch to go from PC to Mac and visa versa!!"
3,"Good Switch, Terrible Audio","I'm a Mac user who just bought a Windows PC for gaming, and wanted to keep my existing monitor/keyboard/mouse/audio setup. The Miniview looked perfect. Well, it's almost perfect. Hooking it up was no problem, and the switching works fine for everything but audio. Using their audio pass-through, I only got the left channel and the sound was really underpowered -- tinny and quiet. This confirms another review here at Amazon criticizing the Iogear Miniview's poor audio. Still, I couldn't find another unit that would do what this one does for the price, so unless you want to move up to a switching hub, this guy is probably your bet. In my case, I have an external amplifier for the computer speakers (the excellent Cambridge Soundworks Model Twelve), so I can just run a separate audio cable from the PC into the amp and then switch audio that way when needed -- not a great solution, but good enough."
5,Works Great,"I have 1 computer w/Vista, 1 w/XP. MS wireless keyboard/mouse with single receiver plugged into one of the USB ports. The other is unused. Be sure F-Lock is 'on'. Hot Key = ""ScrLk"" (twice). Works great! No problems."
4,Good product/price,"I highly recommend this product except the audio switcher. I use it for my WinXP and Linux(Fedora 4) machines, monitor, keyboard, and mouse work great (you must use keyboard, mouse with a usb connector). but the audio switcher does not work well, it reduces the voice quantity."
1,quite simply: it doesn't work,"It causes both computers to freeze up completely with no option but to power down out of the open OS. Both computers are Win7 units and less than a year old, but this usb device is totally incompatible with them. That is inexcusable. Don't waste your money and time having to unpack it out of its bubble pack, install it, and then have to try to get it back into its bubble pack and return it -- just don't buy it. -- A KVM switch should be a very simple matter - this one isn't."
5,IOGear 2-Port KVM works Great,"Works perfect after I found out the KVM's USB cables need to be attached to the individual PC's USB port and do not like a USB extension cord, Longer USB wires if IOGear is listening. Also the Mouse and Keyboard ports on the KVM are not interchangeable."
2,Meh,"This switch works well when it works, but it often messes up for me and won't recognize the keyboard at which point your only options are to unplug and plug the keyboard directly into the system, or reboot since there's no software switch that you can switch using just the mouse."
3,Works but ...... with a workaround !,"I bought this switch because the other one I had had problems with Windows 7. Windows 7 has issues with USB switches which are not specifically supported. This one is OK but unfortunately I had another problem.My wireless keyboard mouse set has only one USB plug, this doesn't work with this switch. You either have to have a wired or wireless mouse/keyboard each with one USB plug.That is a bit of a pain but is what I've done.I've contacted the customer service and all they said is that nowhere in their documentation is stated that IT WORKS with wireless devices :-))I think that they should say more clearly that you need a specific setup, wireless settings like mine are very common nowadays. What do you think ?"
1,Awful,"I have used many different kvm switches at different jobs and have never had a problem. I then purchased the iogear kvm for my home computers. I wish I had bought a hammer as well, because I would of smashed that piece of ****. It caused nothing but 5 hours of fustration.First of all, turning it to ""hot key mode"" was as fun as ripping a toe nail off. (You have to press and hold this key for two seconds, then press and hold a second key for one second while still holding key 1. Then remove key 2 while holding key 1. Then within a second let go of key 1) In an hour I got it to work twice.When I finally got it to work, it opened up a whole new list problems. Whenever I would switch screens, I would need to readjust the aspect ratio of the monitor. I could not get both the keyboard and mouse to work simultaneously (either one of the other). I tried every combination imaginable.The sound also wouldn't play properly. I could go on and on.RUN, don't walk away from this technological travesty!"
1,Piece of garbage,"Aside from the fact that the ""audio support"" makes a high-pitched whine constantly, and the fact that my mouse stops working when plugged into it, and the fact that I can't switch between computers, and the fact that I can't reprogram the key to use to switch between computers...I guess it makes a good keyboard/video passthrough connector. Too bad it isn't sold as such.There's a reason this is one of the more inexpensive KVM switches."
2,A real pain to make it switch,"I set this up so my father could work from home on his laptop (using a docking station, which other reviews say is problematic) on the computer in my old room. Now I get calls every week about how he couldn't get it to switch. Since the desktop there isn't on when he wants to use his laptop, it won't switch - the hotkey is useless. A physical switch on this unit would be extremely useful, since unless conditions are just right the hotkey won't respond.It's a pity. The unit is very well-designed otherwise, and when conditions are right it works perfectly."
1,Worked great at 1st,"This worked great at 1st. Loved the easy switching between computers using the scroll lock key. After a couple of weeks, the video screen had distorted images. I rebooted both computers, however the probelm did not go away."
2,Not impressed.,"Not a good can opener. I was really looking forward to having a can opener on this spork which is as good or better than a GI P-38. I have been disappointed. I feel that I was generous in giving it two-stars, however, I may have been majorly let down due to my own hype and hope of it actually being something decent. I spent a LONG time trying to open a can. Also, I prefer titanium. I'm not a huge stainless steel fan."
3,Not the fairest of them all...,"Desiree Shapiro is a heroine who is usually good for a laugh. She's human, funny, and fallible, and her perspective on the world makes her adventures quite delightful.However, ""Murder Can Upset Your Mother"" is probably the weakest in this series of six novels by Selma Eichler. The plot seems quite contrived, and filled with frustratingly false diversions--wedding dresses, food poisonings, and other events which don't contribute to either plot or characterization.The ending, too, is formulaic: we knew who the murderer was, we even knew Desiree was going to catch him, and it was only a quirk of fate and a little sleight of handedness that the drugstore clerk identified the purchaser of the poison as quickly as she did. And then, to add insult to injury, Eichler adds nothing less than a recipe for eggplant parmigiana. It's not even a particularly distinguished recipe, for heaven's sake...but it is in keeping with the mediocrity of the novel."
1,Yuk!,"All I can say is if this author can get books published then she must know somebody because this so-called murder mystery was downright awful. I almost quit reading at page 20 but slogged through the thing.It was boring, it was amateurish and it was not a good read. I think I could have written something better than this.The protaganist is just talking and talking and talking and especially talking in asides to herself. Not funny and not engaging.There were a number of events that were thrown into the story that did not even add to the story development. There were shopping expeditions with a niece that did not add to the story, there was a scene with a young woman in a coffee shop who sat with the lead character, Desiree, and that added nothing to the story.I could go on and on and on. I am stopping here. The story was pathetic and a waste of time.Good thing I got the book from the library."
1,"Talk, Talk, Talk","I was amazed to see that this person has written more than one book. This is the most boring mystery I have ever read. Not only do I not care about the lead, I don't care why the woman was murdered or anything else. The book is too talk-y. Shut up!"
3,"Not ""Kiss"" stuff - but plenty of Eric Carr material!","Like all independent documentaries, ""Inside The Tale of The Fox - The Eric Carr Story"" suffers from the absence of ""official"" material - namely, Kiss music and Kiss footage (even if some Kiss interviews are included). But then, considering how poorly Eric is featured in all of Kiss' documentaries (you can never hear his voice, for instance), this video more than makes up for it. And it does include commentary from Eric's parents, Kiss' original manager Bill Acouin, Kiss' former guitar player Bruce Kulick and his brother Bob Kulick (who replaced Ace Frehley in a few studio recordings) and Cinderella and Slaughter members. A lot of Eric's private video and home films are also included. If you're an Eric Carr fan, you certainly won't be disappointed. If you're a Kiss diehard fan, you'll also want this documentary. By the way, the DVD edition includes four Eric Carr audio recordings."
1,This is NOT related to Buena Vista Social Club...,"Watch out if you order this CD thinking it's related to the ""Buena Vista Social Club!"" They link this title to Buena Vista but it has absolutely nothing to do with it. Don't be duped! This link is bogus! As for the CD, it's overly orchestrated and not very well done, it's children's lullabies, and obviously an attempt to cash in on the Cuban music craze. You've been warned!"
4,Breadman Bread Maker,This breadmaker made excellent bread. Although was a little loud and occasionally the stirring mechanism would lift of the gear. The ease of being able to add nuts to the mix is a great feature.
2,Heroic measures produce a good loaf,"We bake a loaf of whole-wheat bread every day, and experienced two problems with this bread maker: the temperature would be too low for the dough to rise well (later, during the baking stage, the temperature would be adequate) and the pan would shake loose during the mixing phase. We fixed these problems. First, we placed the bread maker in a small enclosed space with a space heater equipped with a thermostat. This small enclosed space is a half bathroom, which seems like a weird place to make bread. We remove the device when we have visitors. Second, from a metal clothes hanger from a dry-cleaning place we folded a kind of brace to hold the pan in place. It produces bad scratches inside the bread maker. With these measures, we're able to bake good loaves.We'll see how long the flimsy pan will last. I think we will pro-actively order the next bread maker, and it will be a different brand. We've had other bread makers before that did not have these problems."
1,Low or no quality control,"Our old Breadman finally died after a long and productive life.This one is not even getting plugged in.The brushed stainless steel looks like it was touched up by hand--refurbished? Or to repair damage at the factory. The control flexible plastic control pad has waves in it -- not flat like the recently deceased one.I am put off of Breadman, but not sure what brand is going to get our dough."
2,Bad locking to keep the pan in place,"I have had this bread machine for a year and a half, I make 3 loaves of bread a week for the past 4 years. So I know what I am doing when it comes to making bread in a bread machine. It makes wonderful bread, if you leave the bread in for a long time after the baking cycle it doesn't get dried out or burnt.It does have some major flaws though. Most of the time I use it now I have to wedge something into the medal things that hold the pan locked in place. Almost every time I use it the pan pops back out. It gets very frustrating having to fix it constantly. It makes wonderful bread, but I can't wait to get rid of the machine, it causes huge amounts of frustration. They really need to fix the design of the lock. I didn't do this that often the first year I had it, but after that it is almost every time I bake bread."
1,Pan won't stay in place!,"When the bread pan stays in place, this is a nice bread machine with great features. However, the pan kept popping out of place and I tried all their ""troubleshooting"" techniques to no avail. The customer service was reluctant to do anything to remedy the situation. Finally I insisted on a new pan, but several months and phone calls later, I still hadn't received it. Now, because of the bread pan knocking around, the inside wall of the bread machine has worked itself loose from the rivet and now has about 1/2"" of give, so the bread pan wil not stay in place at all and is unusable. The customer service is terrible, and a month later I still have not received a replacement machine!"
2,"New model, still has kinks!","In the last 3 1/2 weeks I have been the not so proud owner of two different Breadman TR2500BC. The first we returned because the door did not close all the way and the bread pan would continuously jump out of its holding. The second one we tried burned everything, even on the light setting and using the recipes provided. My previously owned, yes I gave it away before discovering all the problems, bread machine still worked beautifully after eight years. I was just hoping to upgrade and have some of the newer features which this model had. It looks great and the features are extremely easy to use, it just couldn't seem to cook the bread."
2,just arrived and not happy...,"My review not so good at the moment. I only just got it out of the box, and already I am not happy with the plastic sticker that serves as a cover on the control panel. It's not stuck down very well and makes a annoying crackling noise when I press a button. I am so sick of made in China rubbish. Do I send it back? It seems a minor thing. So annoyed!!! Anyone else have the same problem?"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I received a Breadman Ultimate Plus as a Christmas gift in December 2009. Within 3 weeks, I was having problems with the paddle detatching during kneading. This leaves axle grease in your loaf, which you usually do not discover until the bread is finished baking. The machine is averaging ruining every third loaf at this point and I am trying to return it and receive a refund. Save your money and buy a better machine or just learn to make bread by hand. When it works, the machine makes delicious bread. But after having problems and reading 7 y.o. reviews where the same problem existed, it seems the manufacturer doesn't care to correct long-standing issues with this product."
3,"very poor design - metal clips, pan fit, removing/inserting pan","I was given this machine as a gift. The bread itself is fine but the pan is very poorly designed. I've made 2 loaves of bread and already the metal clips are bent out of shape and the pan isn't fitting correctly. The pan does not lift out of the tray easily and I really have to struggle to get it out (thereby bending the metal clips)and I'm pretty strong. I can't imagine it's going to last very long. The bread quality is fine - I need to experiment with recipes, etc. I made jam with frozen berries and that was super easy and very good. I'm looking forward to trying new recipes; I only hope it doesn't break. It just seems flimsy to me."
1,POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"Breadman's customer support is terrible and they will not stand by their product. I had a problem with a previous model. It was clearly a design flaw. They would not replace the breadmaker when I called and told them of the issue and instead told me all I needed to do was pull out the clips and that would fix the problem. It did for a while but when it no longer worked the breadmaker was out of warranty and I was rudely told that they would do nothing, even when I explained that I called when it was still under warranty. The solution - I should buy a new pan (must be a redesigned pan) for close to $50 w/ shipping. NO THANKS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE. WILL NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT. POOR DESIGN. BUY FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER."
4,tr2500bd breadman machine,Works great.......little noisy but is doing a lot of work! Very good value.
5,New Toy,"Just got this yesterday and I am Baking Like a Fool. My new Toy is perfect, to bad the owner isn't. The first loaf came out just awful. My fault by not paying attention to measuring the Salt right Ewww, 2 tablespoons not good, 2 teaspoons just right, the next loaf was absolutely delicious. I used the time cycle to wake up to fresh bread baking in the house mmm. This could be addictive with so many delicious breads and jams to make. Perfect for the cook who wants to bake bread and not make a mess."
2,"Just returned my first one, let's see if second one is better","I just returned my Breadman after only 2 loafs made. It appears the metal brackets which hold the bread pan in place are ineffective. During the kneading process the bread pan will pop up out of the drive assembly and essentialy stop turning the mixer arm. I liked what I saw otherwise. My first 2 loaves came out as expected, and controls were intuitive enough. I'm hoping my second one works!!"
2,Low quality product,"1. Finish is rough and cheap. At first look, I had a feeling that this would be a low quality product.2. Pan often pops out of the base.3. Heating is not even or optimized.4. Finally, only after several uses, the axis at the bottom of the pan was stuck and could not rotate. Probably the rolling bear was damaged. And I could not find a replacement pan."
1,Breadpan stuck,We haven't tasted the bread yet as the bread pan is stuck in the machine. My husband and I have tried everything to pull it out but to no avail. We will wait till it cools down and try again. I am not sure what that will do to the bread as the instructions say to take it out immediately. Dissappointed in the product!
1,No replacement PANS!,"You buy this thing, the pans come loose. So you crimp the crappy 'pan latch' and if you don't break if off and destroy the machine, then either the electronics fail OR you get another year... then the paddle comes off. Don't buy the paddle... that's NOT the problem. So, now you look everywhere for a replacement PAN. Can you guess? Salton doesn't MAKE them. Bad company: no product support!"
4,So far so good!,"I've only made three loaves of 2lb white bread (using all purpose flour rather than bread flour) and they've turned out great. No problems with the machine at all. I love that it has so many options for programming, etc. Overall I'd say if you're looking for a good breadmaker, this is it!"
5,It's Great,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she says that it is one of her favorite gifts. She has made over 25 differnt types of loafs of bread and pretzels without one single problem. Every problem that the others have complained about seem to have been taken care of. To see my wifes happy face after each succesful loaf makes me even happier that I got it for her for Christmas. If it breaks tomorrow I will gaurantee you I will be buying another.
5,Does the job,"I bought this 4 years ago. I feel that using it over a hundred times, not encluding just for making dough for other things ,this machine does the job. I tweeked the flange on the inside on the unit and stopped the breadpan from comong loose. Just bend the flanges slighly and the pan snaps right in. As for "" Walking "" place a moist towel under the machine and it won't crawl. Marble or real smooth counters are usally the problem. Trial and error on your recipes hones your knowledge when to add flour, water, hows the humidity and altitude etc. A little patence and note taking and you will have fun. If not, bread is still sold in stores."
2,I solved the pan popping out problem,"After using bowls, phone books and other improvised devices to keep the pan seated on the motor, I finally came to a solution (so far, anyway). I cut a piece of 1""x1"" pine molding so that it fits snugly across the top of the pan (lengthwise), but wedges itself under the lip around the baking compartment. This serves to wedge the pan into its proper place. It has held steady for more than 6 loaves. I suspect it will eventually bend the metal out of shape, and I may have to use a longer piece of wood to hold it in place. WARNING: I first tried this with plastic tips on the end of the wood, so as not to scratch the metal surface, and make it fit more snugly, but the heat during the baking cycle melted the tips. I suppose you could stand over the machine and remmove the wooden brace after the final kneading cycle."
2,Customer Service,They say it is all about the service and I learned that the quality of the customer service supporting this bread machine is poor. I have an earlier version of this bread maker and wanted to get another machine for a number of reasons. Customer service could tell me nothing.. Not even where I could buy one.. The back ground noise was at a level where I could hardly hear the representative speak and they demanded my phone number before they would even talk to me. Once they did the information was so generic it was useless.. From the very moment I called in it was all about getting me off the phone. So without going into all of the details and as much as I thought these were great machines initially I would hate to see what would happen if I actually needed service.. So I have reconsidered purchasing from Salton/Breadman and have begun to research other manufacturers.
3,"Its ""alright"" for the money","Let's face it. 200 bucks for a CDR capable DVD player is pretty good. The plus is that its from Panasonic. My qualms with the player is that it feels like its been built kinda cheap. The MP3 player that is built-in is the worst you'll probably ever find. If you have any MP3s that are of substandard quality i.e. <128 kbps, you'll hear half music, half static and interference. YOu can't catalog the files. They're just listed as numbers 1-999. The picture quality of course is great. DVD quality video from Panasonic will always be of high quality. The shortcomings of this dvd player is that the peripherals basically suck in comparison with something you'd really want. The remote is ok. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little flexibility in their Home Theater Budget, but if you have the wallet, go on to something better."
4,Works for me!,"Works for me! My doctor says my prostate is smaller, the size that a man 20 years younger would have. No side affects as I got from use of Flomax."
5,Dont let these other jokers fool you..,"Ive been writing electronic music on cpu's since the days of the AMIGA 600, and sound cards have been my life since getting into PC's 8 years ago. Don't be fooled, this card is THE BEST CARD FOR THE MONEY out there. If you write music especially! It may not be the best for your 32 surround sound speaker system or whatever, but straight up this card cant be beat for the money. The next best card is the turtle beach santa cruz, which is a good card, but if you need the imputs and the superb sound quality of a professional system, Platinum Live 5.1 is for you, word on the streets."
2,"Nice sound, but in the stone age","Although I think that this sound card does deliver some of the best sound quality I've heard, plus support for tons of different speaker options, I was really disappointed to learn that creative still has not realized that Windows 2000 is a operating system that quite a few people use, yet still include little software that works with the sound card under Win 2k. Not to mention that the software that doesn't work is the studio software, so if you want to make music, and you run a decent operating system, your out of luck. Creative's response to the issue: not our problem. Although I like the card, think about what you need it for before you buy. Creative likes hiding a lot of important information that would influence your buying decision in extremely fine print."
3,"Good Card but NOT the Best, Pricey","I have a high end dolby digital sound system hooked up to my computer, including full surround and a sub. The Platinum card was easy to install, had a ton of applications and games included, but did not recreate the 6 channels as well as the Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 card I've since bought. At [$] less, the Philips card was won time and time again over the Platinum because it recreates the sound more faithfully, and can create 6 channels of audio from everything from MP3's to games. Do yourself a favour pick up the Philips card, get some more ram, and if you miss the platinums remote, which was useless anyways, get a Logitech one from e-Bay. Or spend [ $ ] for the second rate card."
2,PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased the sb platinum 5.1 and have had nothing but problems! I have had problems with IRQs and DMA settings. This card is a pci card but DOES NOT LIKE NOR WANT TO SHARE IRQs. I have tried everything from maually setting irqs, to making the irqs legacy based, but always have conflicts and stablity problems. If you have a motherboard with a via chipset I recomend you do reserch on wheather there are other who have problems, there are some known issues this card has with those chipsets....."
3,Just decent...,"I've been listening a lot of Quik CD's these days and this one is my least favourite. The majority of the songs r great but comparing to ""Balance & Options"" or ""Under tha Influence"" it's clearly on a lower level...even Nate Dogg sounded tired on that ""Medley for a V"" joint...I still have to listen ""Safe & Sound"" as well as ""Quik is the name"" but It's hard to believe that those albuns will be wacker than this one...still a decent cd though...""So many ways"" is definitelly my joint!!!"
5,Quik At His Best,Yo this album is the tightest. Even if you don't like the lyrics the beats make up for that. He is a musical masterpiece.. His beats and grooves is the best. So you should all go out and buy this album.
1,Rated: STG,"I always support anything in the fashion and beauty field but this was Worst movie I've ever watched... I want to forget it... I rated it 'STG' as in ""straight to garbage"" because I literally took it out of my dvd player and threw it away!"
2,Looooong and slow,"I typically love books based on Indian culture and cultures that have arranged marriages, etc. However this book was not what I had hoped it would be.While the story starts out great with a growing family moving to make a better life for themselves and the experiences they face, it slowly becomes something a bit more political and focuses on war too much. I could not get passed the war talk! It seemed to go on forever and I was disappointed by how the story unfolded. There seemed to be too much about the war and not enough about the main characters. I was very disappointed but that is probably because I was thinking the story would be something entirely different."
4,The Twentieth Wife,It is easy reading and I have enjoyed this author very much. I will probably buy some more of her books.
4,"More fiction than history, but very well-written","Like most historical fiction, this book is more fiction than history. However, the historical details are present, and not in a superfluous manner--they were sufficient to keep me from getting frustrated and were acutally woven into the story, not just halfheartedly thrown in.As for the story itself, Sundaresan is a good writer, and knows how to hold her reader's interest. The characters are reasonably well-developed (I say ""reasonably"" because some are better developed than others), the descriptions are enough to keep the reader's imagination fired but not excessive, and the plotline itself is strong. I wouldn't put this book in the top-10 I have ever read, but it was still a four-star read and I will be one of the first to own ""Feast of Roses"", the sequel to ""Twentieth Wife"", when it comes out on paperback."
1,GOT JUNK?,"To put it simply, this thing is junk,I was using it to burn mp3s I downloaded from the net.First I bought a spool of 50 cd-rws, at least 30 of them were coasters.Iomega said it was the cds I was using ( great excuse, blaming blank cds).As of today I have tried 5 differnt brands of blanks,none of which can be reconized by the burner,it just keeps saying ""insert a recordable cd"" when there is one in the drive.Right now my two sons are smashing this burner in the yard with baseball bats,I wish the C.E.O. of Iomgea was out there also.DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!"
4,It just does the job.,"This unit works fine with my Dell system, occasional glitches aside. The adaptec software is good enough, though the labling programs need work. They frequently re-arrange text after you get it the way you want it. Very frustrating. Aside from that the CDs have come out flawless every time. Note, I have only used it for music."
1,Not compatible with Toshiba Satellite,"My Toshiba Satellite lap top would not recognize this Iomega CD-RW. After several weeks of trouble shooting with the tech support they finally sent me a new USB cable; but my computer still was unable to recoginze this CD-RW. After all this time spent trouble shooting and waiting for a new cable, finally, someone at tech support admitted that this Iomega unit is not compatible with Toshiba Satellite units. [....]Buyer be ware,John"
1,Not for use with Mac,"Customer service by e-mail was unable to provide useful information on how to use this product with a G3 Powerbook running OS 8.6. I was told that a required extension is ""Toast USB Iomega Bridge,"" which doesn't come with the software supplied. The online person at Iomega sent me to Adaptec for an upgrade (Toast 413 OEM) which I installed but which didn't enable me to copy anything. He then brushed me off with the suggestion that I check whether my media (which I had told him had been supplied by Iomega) was compatible with the product. When I asked whether we shouldn't be tracking down a source for the missing extension, I was told to refer further inquires to the phone line--which is so backed up as to be virtually useless."
3,Choosy Consumer,"The standard rule 'You get what you pay for' applies with this purchase. Purchsse summary: Functional. I needed to hang / display bath towels in a room with limited space. This stand is not tall enough to hang standard size bath towels from the middle bar (nevermind the others), and have the space to use the shelf as indicated in the photos. Originally purchased due to lack of choices - I'm reminded of the standard rule. If you're looking for something nicer - hold out and spend the extra $$ otherwise you'll be disappointed."
4,Home boy still very much love in RSA,This is one of his first albums as a young artist. He really has grown into a mature proffesional musician.I recently went to watch him apprearing live here in Johannesburg. I so wish he can do more of these shows here in South Africa. I have also said in the past Jonathan Butler should colaborate with Earl Klugh on a Album. Iam sure we would be in for a treat.This album brought back some great memories. Its is a collectors item.
4,Great movie,"Any movie that ticks off China as much as this movie did is a winner. It opens us up to how some countries deal with criminals, and how judicial systems work in China. I learned alot about both, though the story is through Hollywood's eyes. I do wish we could deal with some people, ie...murderers, in this country the same way they do in China."
5,One of my favorites,"I will not rehash points about the novel's quality/structure/etc. as dozens of review have already done so. I'll keep it short and sweet.Pros:Original ideas/story, solid scientific accuracy (as far as I can tell)Powerful atmosphereEnjoyable, dynamic, intelligent writing styleCons:Poor balance of multiple storylines (+some storylines are not satisfactorily resolved)Characters somewhat lacking in development; some characters are arguably extraneousBook lacks cohesion; transitions are not smoothThis is one of my favorite science fiction novels ever. Bear's writing style here is tops. It's just an extremely enjoyable, innovative, well-written book with a few narrative issues. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a nanotech SF book."
5,Fantastic Novel synthesizing many scientific disciplines,"Although the book is dated, the possibilities that it portrays are not too unreasonable in today's society. The inclusion of genetics, politics, human evolution, metaphysics and many other subsciences is well done and makes it quite interesting. Philosophically, the book brings up progress, consent, and the next stage in evolution. The book is quite interesting and is a great outlook for the future. I wish it was only that easy."
2,Disappointing Use of Sentient Microbes,"Maybe the original Novella this book was based off of had a tighter structure and delivered a story which knew where to stop. It won a Hugo award, I think, and the first 150 pages shined... but afterwards, failure. Too many elements from Hollywood B-movies, most notably 'The Blob' made the late book into a joke. Professor Vergil, despite his technical know-how, comes off as a lonely man who wasn't careful what he wished for.Perhaps I wouldn't judge this book so harshly if I hadn't read it second. While it was published beforeThe Children Star (Elysium Cycle)andBrain Plague (Elysium Cycle), those books by Biology professor Joan Slonczewski covered the same topic with hope instead of ruin. Reading Blood Music after those masterpieces was a big letdown.Overall, I can't recommend this book compared to the two novels above. It's headed for my used bookstore."
2,A childrens book?,"This seems to have been written for children. I don't think that it's much use to anybody, esp today's kids. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because there is nothing wrong with the version itself, just the weak content."
4,The Witch of Wall Street,"As rich as Bill Gates and William Buffet for her time she went around in old clothes eating cold oatmeal and snacking on raw onions. To avoid taxes she moved constantly so that she could not be considered a resident of any city or state, always living in rented apartments in middle class parts of town. She used the facilities of her bank as her office every day. She rode public transportation, refused to tip waiters, and pretended to be poor so she could get free medical care. She was an attractive debutant, married well, but being a miser ruled her life. All the money she ammassed was gone with the death of her two childless children."
3,How I created my Perfect Prom Date,"I thought this book was very good; however, it ended as though there would be a sequal and there is not. The book is very good up until the end when it leaves so many questions unanswered"
1,Positively dreadful,"I am a huge hiphop fan and really liked some other material by New Kingdom that I had heard. That motivated me to buy this CD to get to know them better, but what a huge mistake. This CD is just plain awful--not one song made me want to give it a second listen. Really disappointing, as the other New Kingdom stuff I'd heard was so great."
1,Kitchen Privileges,"This book is, without doubt, the most boring book I,ve ever read. I guess you can't judge a book by it's author, no matter how many 'best sellers' they write."
3,A little corny but still funny with good musical performances,"For any Judy Garland fan, this DVD is a Must Have. Packed with extras such as interviews and biographies, the story itself is kind of corny for modern audiences but there are still a few funny parts. The musical performances are terrific. It's one of those ensemble casts where no one was really a star at the time but all became stars later (like American Graffitti or Diner). I bought it because I'm a big Betty Grable fan and, although she only has a small part in this, she still shines."
2,not 2 wice an album,"I bought this album at the boarder in Germany, don't know why, I haven't heard of him before, it was cheap and I needed some music to the bustrip....well, it's a very weird CD, the only tracks that are good are ""Whut Dew U Mean"", ""No Slang"", ""Burnin' Krypt"" & ""Can You Feel Dis"", the rest is less than nothing.... an' what's with all the slang words?? ""Wuz Craculatin'"" ""Whut Dew - What Do"" ""4 Da Bit@*es"" a.s.o. a.s.o. it's (...), don't buy it... save your money for the forthcoming album ""Be"" from Common, it's gonna be sweet"
2,Offers Piece of Mind,We recently went on a trip where we would be in crowds. I bought this for my son because he has a tendency of darting off. He is 4 and preferred the wrist leash as opposed to the harness. I wish the leash part was longer. It served its purpose but my son didn't want it on all the time.
2,Beware: There are two groups named Gitbox,"A warning before anybody makes the same mistake as me, this is not the same Gitbox that recorded the album ""Last Night I Dreamt of Gary Indiana"". If you like world-music then you will probably like this. It's good background type music, not just not interesting enough to listen to with my full attention."
4,Patriachs,"Good understanding of who the Patriarch's are in the Bible. Great teaching tool for those who want to learn about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and history. Perfect for those who love to dive into history. I would recommend it."
3,misrepresented,"Though not in bad shape, this book was obviously not new. It should have been rated as slightly used as the cover looked a little worn and there was some writing and underlining on the inside."
4,"Great product, however ... has it wrong.","This is great product, platinum live 5.1, however it pictures the x gamer 5.1 and the x gamer 5.1 pictures the platinum. they both work great but the platinum better. just a note to purchases, dont know when ... will find out it has a mistake."
5,Feldenkrais,This book is a wonderful intro to the Feldenkrais exercise method. It will inspire you to find a professional to continue in this most excellent body maintenance. It is especially excellent for seniors and folks with disabilities.
2,Too small,"This camera bag is only for the smallest of cameras - which you could probably fit in your pocket. Check the specifications (Depth 1.5 inches, width 3.4 inches, height 5.5 inches) against your camera prior to buying."
2,old version,"the book was pretty aged, and was an older version than shown in the marketplace. I would have liked to know that it was an older version. This is also more accurately described as fair condition, not good or nearly new."
4,Not exactly what it's billed as...,"I thought I was getting a board book. One my 2 yr old could throw around and it wouldn't matter. I don't recommend this book for a child younger than 3. The pages are not board book pages. They are like glossy cardstock. There are small cutout pieces, strings and even a little booklet that would be totally anhilated by a toddler. So, be warned. It's a super cute book. It has only 3 pages, but it's nicely done, for an older child."
1,awful,I heard a rumor that Martin Atkins is broke and can't pay his half of a mortgage. Doesn't surprise me if this is what Underground is all about lately. This album will go back to the store where it came from and I will trade it in for some good music.
5,This powerful tool for healing is a gift from Laura Day.,"Laura Day is an extraordinary woman. In THE HEALING CIRCLE: An Experience in Recreating Your Life and Living Your Dreams, she takes listeners on a powerful meditative journey.Customized passages (e.g. the ""Morning Quickie"" and ""Night's Journey"") anchor you for the key moments right before and after sleep to help tranform the other 23+ hours of your day.I highly recommend this CD, along with the author's transformational book THE CIRCLE."
3,Meh.,I wasn't exactly thrilled with this version. They changed it up so much from the original that it's not as much fun. And they added a lot of US songs as opposed to the traditional j-pop/rock. I guess I'm just a traditionalist.
4,Good!,"The game arrived in the condition it was promised and played as it was advertised! I like it, but since I usually use workout mode, I don't like how this one has it all combined into one..so I can only do 5 songs before going through everything and starting it over again-- oh well!"
2,overall awsome,I absoulutly would buy this only if you know how to play ddr and if you dont know then it would be a little enberrissing. I know how to play the game really well cause ive been paying for a year or so
4,Yay!,"I like this game due to the fun songs it has. I had this game in the past, but the disc got damaged, so I had been without, trying other versions. But I bought this again because of the songs!"
1,Some things don't get better with age...,"DDR Extreme is all wrong. Most songs aren't even moderately challenging, even on heavy mode. The workout mode makes no sense to me; it will track your calories but you still have to play in game mode. This means that every 3 songs, you have to go through the whole loading process again. In DDR Max 2 the workout mode is different...you can play 400 songs if you want, without starting over. The nonstop mode is also frustrating as you can't customize it. That means you might start with a song on light mode, 1x even though you want to play heavy mode 2x.Also, the new song engine is awkward but I could deal with it were the songs worth playing.I agree with the person that said this is basically a waste of $40. I've had the game since its release and I've played it about 3 times; it frustrates me and I go back to Max2."
2,A novelty record at best,"Fripp's ""Soundscapes"" technique works nicely when paired with other instruments, for example, pieces by King Crimson, David Sylvain, and The California Guitar Trio, but all by itself it is without feeling because it lacks rhythm and melody. The sounds he 'harmonizes' sometimes work -- sometimes not.The liner notes mention that at one of his shows members of the audience were so upset with the quality of his music that a near riot ensued. So why did he include a track from that show? Did he want to infuriate more people? Fripp seems bent on indulging only himself. Note to Robert: it is best that a performer serve the needs of the audience.The redeeming quality of this CD is that it is unique. Certainly no one else plays like this. It sounds very interesting. Unfortunately it is not music."
1,Garbage,"I used these bags to line my kitchen scrap pail about three times. The bags are still IN the compost pile. From last YEAR!! The rest of my garbage has composted, but not these bags. Weird...All in all I think making a new product, whether it's made of biodegradable material or not, seems counterproductive to composting. I mean, the Making of the bags creates waste, right? And uses energy?In any case, I just get some of the paper out of my recycling bin and line the bottom of the pail with that. Yeah, I hafta clean the pail. I rinse it really well outside and put the water from the rinse in the compost also. Yeah, it's gross. (Pre)compost IS gross. haha!"
1,Biodegrades too quickly - buy these if you want a leaky mess!,"I tried these awhile back and the bottom would fall out. They redesigned them with a stronger bottom seam but now the problem is that they start to leak, sweat and smell after about 2 days. We take ours out twice a week but that is not fast enough for these bags. Its really disgusting! I have switched to the Eco Safe brand and those work a little better, still not perfect though. Eco Safe seem a little heavier weight, so I assume they last an extra day or two without leaks because of that."
4,good bags,"As others have stated, these bags are not heavy duty but if you are just a bit careful with them, they're fine. They have not leaked for me and hold their integrity after a week in the bucket. I wouldn't leave them much longer than that though."
3,"Yeah, they biodegrade well. But they're crappy bags.","They leak and are barely better than using nothing at all to line our compost bin. But at least they are better than nothing at all. And they biodegrade unlike all the other Bio bags that are actually made of plastics. So all in all a bit of a wash. If they could make them a little thicker so they wouldn't leak and maybe adjust the size to fit any regular compost bins, I'd be all about it."
4,Pharamaceutical companies - beware,If you work in the pharma industry you will enjoy this book even more. This is the third book in the series of heroine Cassie Burdette. The character development is the best so far. It begins with a LPGA Pro Am introducing the characters and then gathers steam. Islieb did a good job with her research and is acurate. The golf channel or ESPN should do a mini-series based off of the adventures of Cassie Burdette.
4,A learning experience in disguise,"I just finished reading this amazing book. I was at a used bookstore and my mother picked it up, and asked me if I'd like to read it. I read the back, and it seemed alright, so I said ""yeah"", not even giving it another thought. About a week or 2, I remembered about it and picked it up. I couldn't put it down. It's an amazing book about an amazing and herioc girl. It teaches kids about the safety of sex and aids. It's a learning experience in disguise, because it's so real and griping, that the message comes easy and naturally to you. You can sit in a classroom all day and listen about AIDS, but you never get the full effect of the disease, until you hear the grim truth of it through a person, who's lived it. This is an excellent, book that people of any age or gender will enjoy!"
2,it's okay,I wasen't really affected by the way this book was writen - but it's still a good read. The plotline kept my interest...though the ending must've not been very interesting because I can't remember it.
3,Nancy's Not So Neutral Life,"It Happened to Nancy was a very intriguing book. It is a combination of romance, suspense, and very unexpecting events. I would definantly recommend this book to teenage girls thirteen years old and up. One of the scenes I enjoyed in the book was when Collin and Nancy made a picnic basket and rode out to an island. I thought that was very romantic. I feel this book is realistic and can easily connect to the readers. To find out more you'll just have to read it for yourself."
3,It Can't Happen To Me,"We thought the book, It Happened to Nancy, was very heartwarming. However, at times, the book had its down fall. Nancy was an excellent writer, but she liked to drag things out. In the beginning she was very happy with her life and throughout the book she would go from being lively to dull. This book would be perfect for anyone struggling through a hard time and needs an extra hand to pick them up. At times it gets quite sappy and we feel bad for her. Then at other times, she would do such courageous things that would make us just want to shake her hand! Nancy wanted to deliver the message about how she thought that she could never catch the AIDs virus either, but then something terrible happened. She wrote in her diary all the time and after the tragedy it was published and made into this book. Overall, it was okay."
1,Skinhead Punk? I don't think so.,"Sorry, when I bought this at the store, I thought I was getting some angry OI!, but it was so bad, I beat the CD with a stick."
3,Por Fripp,"Compré este disco, imagino que como el 95% de sus compradores, por la presencia en él de R. Fripp. Otras colaboraciones del guitarrista se limitan a su aparición esporádica en uno o dos temas. En este caso nos encontramos ante un disco en el que la mitad de los temas parecen sacados de los soundscapes o de alguna grabación de los projekts. Lamentablemente la otra mitad (imagino que la parte que corresponde a los tales ""Ten Seconds"") no es sino el rock de toda la vida y, ciertamente, no creo que eso sea suficiente a estas alturas. En fin, siempre se pruede programar el CD y oir solo los temas en los que participa Fripp."
4,Body language and eye expression - plus!,"Bogart. Greenstreet. Lorre. Sloe-eyed Marta. Actors who never over-acted but used subtle yet dynamite facial expressions and/or body language to express mental venom or sensual interest; the slightly widening eyes or raised eyebrow to denote surprise or danger.And best of all - - the background music never, never, never blared so as to outdo the actor's voice. The Actors' spoke clearly and distinctly. Excellent support cast as well as direction and camera."
2,piaa h7 cool blue are not blue,These bulbs where advertiseds as having a lite blue tint . There is no blue tint at all they are between yellow and clear . I would not recommend them to any one else .
2,BK,"After all the hype about PIAA, they were no better than my stock bulbs. Nothing ""Super White"" about them that I can see. Look for 5k bulbs before these."
3,Let The Power Be Sampled,"When restarting his solo career in earnest in 1994, Robert Fripp updated his Frippertronics technique with digital technology - instead of tapes - to create loops of sounds.The Soundscapes projects included six CD releases of new material and this ""single"" collection from The Gates of Paradise and A Blessing of Tears. With three selections from the former and one from the latter, it is a bit puzzling, since there is no burning incentive for fans who already have the pair of CD's to delve into this one, unless they are seeking a complete catalog of Fripp solo releases.For those intrigued by these oftentimes metallic-sounding, non-melodic works, it is a nice sampler before making an investment in a number of CD's. The landscape Fripp paints through sound is intriguing and - at times - quite powerful. This release is a decent directional map of his vision."
4,a legend in flamenco,"I have spent many hours listening to another recording of Carmen Amaya---an album entitled ""Furia"". It was my father's and the record is probably more than 50 years old! In trying to find ""Furia"" on CD I came across this recording and it is a worthy addition. Carmen Amaya was an amazing talent and I am glad to be able to hear more of her performances."
1,You'll be needing lots of these...,"If you're using the maglite solitaire, then you'll be getting through a few of these. The bulbs are quite fragile and don't last that long. They're also rather dim. There are much better, smaller lights out there - some of the best are made by ARC in Arizona."
2,Didn't make it to the end,"I borrowed this book from the library and I only finished up to ch. 5 and have had enough of this book. I felt this book was poorly written and the characters were plastic; I couldn't connect with them. The storyline just didn't seem realistic. Reading this book was like watching a very bad TV show. I stopped at ch. 5, skimmed through the book and read the last chapter and returned the book back to the library way before the due date. If you want to read a good romance novel with a sci-fi/fantasy/supernatural element, check out the Roswell High series by Melinda Metz, or even better, watch the Rowell tv series to be rerunned on Sci-Fi Channel beginning Jan. 2003. Skip this book Forever!"
2,Two Stars: Only Out Of Respect For The Author,"I've always been a big fan of Jude Deveraux. I loved Sweet Liar and Remembrance. This book does not hold a candle to either of those.The beginning has the tone and style of a good fairytale. Everything after that first chapter is mediocre at best. The romance between the two main characters isn't interesting or realistic.I was very, very disappointed by the ending. Things were just getting really interesting and the author cuts away from it. The ending is explained in the epilogue. Also, I thought the epilogue's ending was a little too cutesy.The book did have some interesting parts but it never drew me into the story the way her other books have. Skip this one. It's not worth the price.If you've never read anything of her's, don't start with this one. I recommend Sweet Liar, Knight In Shining Armor, and Remembrance."
1,Worst ever!,"I have been a huge fan of Jude Deveraux's work for the past 5+ years. I have read every book she's written. This has got to be the worst. I absolutely hated the main character. The story line was horrible. It just seemed like another person wrote it. What happened to the romance, excitement, and passion of her previous works?Ever since High Tide her writing has changed somehow for the worse. I hope her next book is better"
2,The story just fell apart,"Let me preface my review by saying I really do like Jude Deveraux. I think her historical romances are top notch and her contemporary novels are insightful and real page-turners. Sadly this was not one of her best. I was very intrigued by the story premise of a main charcter with paranormal powers and how she is involved in this witch-coven storyline. Unfortunately, her main charcter Darci was too naive almost for belief. Even if you could move past that (we often do here in the romance genre), the suspense and excitement was ruined by the anticlimactic, disjointed ending. I just don't understand why Jude broke up the most exciting ending by adding an epilogue in the middle of it, then proceeded to kill your interest by having the climax explained by one of the characters rather than by actually describing it. Just weird. Inconsistent and weird. Not to mention frustrating. Could have been a good one - but instead it just fell apart."
1,What happened to the old Jude Deveraux???,"I loved her earlier books. Her last severval offerings seem to be written by a different person. I had held out hope for this one because she returns to the Montgomery family, but it falls way short. I had to struggle to finish. I didn't care how it ended. I have given up hope that any future offerings will be better. I won't buy another."
5,Handel in Depth,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer. I found this set of Handel's Op. 6 in a used CD shop last year and haven't stopped playing it. Yes, the performance practice is old fashioned -- if by that one means that Busch and his players give the music ample time to breathe. On the other hand, these are by no means plush, precious or over-inflated interpretations (such as one hears from Furtwängler, Karajan and even Karl Richter in this repertoire). The slow movements are particularly heavenly, though the faster, dance-inspired movements are given with fetching high spirits, and some of the fugal movements convey an appropriate dramatic tension. Busch's crack ensemble play with enormous brio and virtuosity throughout, and the sound is pretty good for ancient monaural. This set is long out of print and pretty expensive, but worth it if you care for great historical performances of Baroque repertoire. Not to be missed."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited about this new book light after hearing Oprah rave about it. However, it now sits unused in my bookcase. It's too heavy and cumbersome to be comfortable for bedtime reading and requires a firm, steady hand to hold it in place no matter where you are. Nowhere near as comfortable to use as book lights that clip on the book."
3,ok,said product was new wasn.t new had scratchs on disc still play wont buy from them item came fast. package ok
5,It works great for me.,"I have been using the royal APF300 for about 2 years now and I fold well over 5000 invoices with it per year. It works very good for the price. I use it in my warehouse and it is a very dusty enviornment, sometimes it messes up, but a quick spray-out with the air hose or a spritz of WD-40 always fixes the problem. After using mine for years I recommended it to my friend, he didnt have an account on Amazon so I am here buying it for him. After reading all the bad reviews I had to put my 2 cents in."
4,Better than groundbreaking; it's hot sex,"Sure, it's a groundbreaking anthology. But better than that, it's an excellent anthology of erotic stories. Gender variety has been discussed in a variety of scholarly articles and books, but the pleasures and passions that can be expressed by the broad range of gender identity and sexual orientation is well and truly described through the tales in this anthology. They are from a variety of perspectives, and really get the reader going with hot, explicit descriptions of sex between FTMs and their lovers; MTFs and their lovers, and the folks who might or might not describe themselves as fully transitioned. If you're the type to buy ""groundbreaking books"" then buy it. But really: buy it because it's hot sex."
4,Beautiful,"The photos are very beautiful. It has some good basic information about mehndi in general, not a whole lot of specifics, but a nice book to look at for some inspiration."
3,OK,This book was ok! i am a beginner and this book had a little to much history! i just wanted the designs and how to do them! This book was too detailed for my taste!
2,Keeps getting sillier after a good beginning,"The movie starts very well with a clever plot, excitement, and two attractive main characters. But with every quarter hour the plot gets sillier. Toward the end it becomes totally absurd, when the two main characters, armed with pistols, set out to confront a large number of heavily armed brutes. (The idea of reporting the baby's abduction to the FBI does not occur to anyone.)"
4,La Cage Aux Folles (original French version),"Though the images are bit dated now, the humor is timeless. The prejudices of society are still the same, so today's audiences will enjoy the film as much as those of us who saw it back in the 70's.The film doesn't dwell on the relationship of the two men, but on the need to fool the parents of their son's fiance, who would stop the wedding if they knew the parents of the Laurent were gay.Sound quality could be better."
4,French classic movie,"This film is in French, with English dubbing. The actors are professional and the story later donein Birdcage. The setting seems dated yet was well done. We ordered La Cage II and soon to orderthe third. You get caught up in their escapades."
3,"Great movie, Substandard Transfer","Since others have already expounded on the enduring comic nature of the movie itself, I'll restrict my comments to the DVD. I'd give the movie about 4 stars, but the DVD transfer I would award only 2.Why? The film quality is not only substandard, but on occasion the frame jumps, as if somebody had bumped the telecine during the process. Additionally, the audio is VERY poor, not only varying in loudness, but at times the French audio track is not even synchronized with the lip movements on screen.This would be worthy of a re-do by Criterion or other reputable production company...please?"
5,Serrault is the best!,"I would have given La Cage Aux Folles three marks at best, for while it is a pleasent French comedy, not different in style to many French comedies of the period, it has one major asset that distinguishes it from all others, Michel Serrault.He plays the camp 'queenie' star of the show La Cage Aux Folles to perfection..He is simply great.The first La Cage..is the best, the sequel I believe was made because of the huge success the original had, but still Serrault gives his best in every scene, while dont bother with the third installement, it is simply lame..Yet beware of the American remake 'Birdcage', if you want the same story with no subtitles, because it is simply awful, and stick to the original, even if you do not understand a word of French, Serrault's genuis performance will be more than enough to make you laugh very hard!"
3,Very Good,"I really enjoyed this DVD, but where are the dance numbers that are so GOOD!!! Yvonne Lowe"
4,Tribute to a great pianist,"Ralph Sutton burst onto the jazz scene in the mid 1940s and has remained one of the finest jazz pianists ever since. Strongly influenced by Fats Waller, he has the strongest left hand in the business, has enormous power, drive and swing, coupled to great sensitivity and sophistication.This book is a life of Sutton but also an appreciation, drawing on the views of admiring fans and equally admiring jazz musicians. Although critical of some facets of Sutton's life, the overwhelming sense of the book is one of great affection and respect for a person who is not only a superb musician but a genuinely nice man.The book includes a discography, interesting but now slightly dated, and also a fine range of photographs.For Sutton's many fans this should be self recommending. For others it gives some interesting insights into the life of the professional jazz musician, and should inspire you to buy some of his CDs! Recommended."
5,a perfect blend of exotic beats and electronic melodies.,"this group is great, whether you want music to listen to all alone or as the back drop to an ultra cool party this C.D. has everything."
5,Infectiously cool...,"In amongst the huge amount of distinctly second-rate laid-back electronica and chill-out music that's out there are some real hidden gems. And here's one... an album full of cleverly arranged, addictive beats that will grab repeated space on your CD player. Why? Well, despite its distinctly ""tacky"" cover, ""Freaks & Icons"" is in fact one of the coolest albums around... closer to Thievery Corporation than Kruder & Dorfmeister, but with the same beautifully crafted, multi-layered instrumentation of their more popular peers, it incorporates East European & Asian influences into familiar, rock-solid jazz-funk and ""chill out"" structures that, seemingly effortlessly, roll along from start to finish. After a couple of times through, the infectious melodic ""hooks"" that underpin virtually every track take hold and, before you know it, you're hitting the replay button yet again."
4,"Part trip-hop, part funk, part blissed out","The slip cover on this disc referenced Kruder & Dorfmeister, Saint Etienne and others and those are good starting points. The disc has a lot less dub in it than a K&D track, but there's some nice funk underneath the percussion of ""After"" that would fit right in on K&D's Session's disc. There are some really open-ended soundscape tracks that roll along (the closing ""Spacewater"" and the narrated ""Colores"") to balance the funkier tunes.The tempo is certainly laid back, and the songs flow really well - there's no jumping from low BPM into a club anthem or anything like that, so a good listen on the headphones will be rewarding."
2,I expected more from Topeak,"I bought this fender for my Specialized Expedition Sport comfort bike to keep mud and water off of the frame during my commutes to work on paved and dirt roads. The front portion of the fender was so far above the wheel that it did almost no good. Also, after about only a week of use, the front portion of this ""quick release"" fender snapped completely off. For the last week or so I have been riding with only the rear portion of the front fender, and this morning the entire installation mechanism came out of my bike. I followed all of the installation instructions and this fender still failed. I expect more from the Topeak brand. This product is ineffective and cheaply engineered and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Terrible fender!,"I bought this fender along with the matching rear because the price was good. It installed without problems ( I was careful not to overtighten it) and I was happy with it for the first 2 months. Then, on a short ride on a singletrack, the front fender simply came off! It was the damnest thing! I thought it just came loose and I could get it back on with my allen wrench, but when I retrieved it, I noticed that the plastic mounting nut that secures the fender to the inside of the fork, broke!. Seriously! I tried to repair it using a small metal nut, but it no longer stays firmly attached to the fork. I really like the looks of the fender and the ABS is tough, but the mounting system is absolutely terrible. To add insult to injury, Topeak won't sell you a replacement part; you have to buy a whole new fender. Stay away from this one!"
5,Great Melodic Improvisation,"If you enjoy listening to melodic ideas, and improvisations on a theme, you'll like both Rollins' and Scott's work on Salvador, a very joyful tune. The Harold Vick song is a wonder; how Sonny comes up with all those ideas based on a simple four note/five note pattern, only heaven knows.Many players are hard to connect with; they drive too fast, and try to say too much. These guys tell stories, using phrases, sentences, paragraphs and spaces."
5,Fantastic Imagination,"I found this book on my bookshelf and read it while on holiday because it looked quite thick. It is tale of pure fantasy, the imagination in the writing and storyline makes this one of the best books ever. The writing is light-hearted and continuously upbeat, Captain Bluebear displays an amazing capacity for optimism which makes you love every second of his lives. The story twists bizare tales which defy prediction and keep you wondering what will happen next. It is witty and comical with many illustrations however the thing I love about this book is that it is a tall tale well told, a classic of creativity and story telling."
4,Much better than pen and paper!,"I really like this product for what it is. The two options for favorite foods and new foods are a bit redundant for me. Also wish it had a cover or carrying case...but otherwise, a good product!"
3,for king crimson connossieurs only,"this recording is not for everyone to listen. non crimson fans surely will find it very boring because they don't know what to listen at. for crimson lovers it is of much signifficance since through it we can undestand how this hyperimpressionist music was born. eventhough, it's maybe a once-in-a-lifetime listening; it'll hardly become somebody's favourite."
2,The Low Down,"Alright, Here is the 411 on this phone and service.PHONE- Very good. Loud Speakerphone, cool external display, camera, and color. Very good phone for the price ($150.00)SERIVICE- Where do I start? TMobile is the worst service in the world. I have experimented with AT&T, Cingular, TMobile, Sprint, Verizon, and Nextel. TMobile is by far the worst. If they had this phone with Cingular or ATT, I would take it in a minute. Good Phone, Crappy company. In my experimentation, here is what I found...ATT- 4/5Nextel- 4/5 (extra 2.00 for caller id + voicemail)Verizon- 5/5 (EXPENSIVE THOUGH!)Cingular- 3/5 okay, not the greatestSprint- 5/5 (Good service, good phones, good deals)TMobile- 0/5 NEVER AGAIN. No Signal"
4,Big improvement!,"I originally purchased the Motorolla V66 (which was terrible)when I switched to T-mobile. I had poor reception, so switched to this phone a few days ago. So far I am very pleased. It gets good reception even though I live in the boondocks, the feautures are mostly easy to use, and it's fun! I'm a sucker for gadgets, and the games keep me occupied during lectures. I am also very pleased with T-mobile's service so far. I especially like that one can change the ring style without flipping open the phone."
3,Started out alright. Now having problems.,"Physically the phone looks great and does what it should, but lately I am having more problems. When using AIM it locks up and you have to remove the battery and reset the phone. Also the camera pics are starting to become fuzzy if there is low lighting. Also there are other covers available for it, but you have to VOID the warrentee to change the covers. One thing I do like about this phone is that I haven't had any dropped calls. I live in a highly urban area and with the previous phone (Samsung) I was having dropped calls constantly, and sometimes when on a call I had to stand perfectly still or risk dropping the call. The V300 has not been like that at all."
2,Dont expect it to last...,"I bought this unit in February of 04. Since about August, I have started having major problems with it. One of these is the speaker going out on it. Now, the only way to talk to someone is to use the speakerphone or use a handsfree cable. Another problem I have found is that the unit will periodically reset itself. I may press the button to open up a text message, hit send to answer a call, or do absolutely nothing at all. On top of that, T-Mobile has horrible coverage and customer service. So just be advised..."
1,Bad Charger!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! NOT EVEN FOR FREE!!! This is an old phone, and will be out of production soon. Because it has a bad charger connection. It will stop charging after a little while. You cannot buy the charger from any T-Mobile store!! It is a bad design and they know it!!! They already switched to another charger that's more reliable for other phones."
2,Good looking but poor quality,"I did a lot of research before upgrading my dead Samsung phone. I really liked the look and features of the Motorola V300, such as speaker phone, camera with 4x zoom, color display, and I love the cobalt blue soft material the outer shell is made with.When I got it home I found that my camrea didn't work. It would stretch and blur the photos, totally distorting the image. Neither text nor picture messages would send. The delay on ANYTHING you try on the phone is several seconds. The call and end buttons were on the *wrong side* which is just a personal irritation. When you press any button chances are it wouldn't 'take' and it would have to be pressed again pretty hard for the phone to get the command.On the plus side the speaker phone was crystal clear, great bright screen, and again I love the exterior.I played for two weeks and sent the phone back. Overall I just don't like what Motorola had to offer, and I will be returning to Nokia or Samsung."
1,Cute but shallow,"Cool color to begin with, but scratches easy, even with a cover on, pouch and all. The functions are confusing, and slow. Still trying to get use to it. Too bad Nokia has no flip phones."
2,NOT the phone for those who love to text,"This phone is driving me insane! I haven't had any serious problems with this phone, but it does have one serious pitfall. It's SLOW!!!!! It takes a second to type in a letter and the ""predictive input"" is frustrating. It has also shut down TWICE because i had been typing too fast on the AIM program. lame!!!Everyone who is drawn to the value, camera, and color BEWARE of what lies beneath. Try it out first. Enter a number, or send a text messege.I havent had problems with T-Mobile yet, although the service is ""area-consicous."" you have to check to see if it works well in your area before you buy it or esle you might find yourself stranded w/o service.also, certain things to this phone dont seen intuative to me. quite unrefined."
1,This phone sucks!!!!,"I got this phone less than three months ago. The antenna has broken, it drops calls, and worst of all, it rings without any sound or vibration. It's never on silent or vibrate. I hate this phone so much. The camera quality is even bad compared to the samsung phones offered by Sprint PCS."
2,The V300 loses volume and T-Mobile and Motorola know that... do you?,"I've had the Motorola V300 for 1 year and 6 days. I liked it just fine. About 2 months ago, however, I sometimes couldn't hear the caller. Since my phone bangs around in my purse and changes the ringer volume, I thought that somehow the volume setting had changed. Every now and then I would sift through the phone settings looking for a volume control, but never found one. In the meantime, I figured out that I could hear people on speakerphone. I finally called T-Mobile yesterday. They were happy to repair/replace the phone for $10 shipping until they told me that it has been out of warranty for 5 days. We have bought 3 phones in the past year - they knew the phone had a problem with hearing the speaker - but they failed to tell me and I stupidly thought the problem was with a phone setting. Buyer beware! I am NOT happy!"
1,What?,"I am so surprised with my phone. I got it today 2:00PM, and I found right away no one can call me. Soon, the soft keys are not working (the upper right and left) at all!. This is driving me nuts. This is not finished; now I can not call anyone (the phone keeps calling but does not connect) and can not use the camera (it says: busy,please try again). I don't what is wrong. Want to cry."
1,worst cell phone ever,"Was a fun gadget at first but started developing problems after about six months. Spontaneously resets to silent or vibrate, so you miss tons of calls. Shows calls that you answered as ""missed"" after you hang up. Charger connection is a terrible design does not fit well, and has to be manipulated to begin charging (This was true from day one). Number of missed calls and number of pending messages indicator is always wrong. Volume spontaneously shuts itself off and you can't hear your caller. I've nursed this phone along for about 18 months now and its headed out to the scrap heap. I won't be stopping by a motorola store on my way back."
4,My experice,"I have been using this phone for more than 5 months now & I am rather happy with this phone. The only thing I would love to see in this is a longer battery life as even a fully charged bettery gets dead at evenings if the phone is used extensively during the daytime. Apart from that, everything works fine for me."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"The phone randomly turns off or doesn't charge properly. I took it to Tmobile and exchanged for a new one since I was having problems and the new one was worse than the first! The phone looks nice but it's a piece of junk. The camera is cool but the pictures don't even come out that great. All in all, you will not get a product that is equal to the amount of money you will pay for it."
3,Good & Bad,"I love this phone, all of its features. I haven't had any problems with it. However, i have only had mine for about 2 1/2 mths and the silver paint is chipping off of it everywhere. Which I would understand if I beat the heck out of it. However, it sits at home or in a lined pocket and hardly gets any use !!!! Still fighting with T-Mobile for them to replace it. Its only a minor annoyance, the phone works fine, but that still shouldn't happen after a couple of mths."
3,Bad Signal,The phone is great. Excellent battery life. The only item I can complain about it is the reception and signal inside some building is horrible. Thousands of dropped calls. I also have a Nokia with T mobile and the reception is perfect in the same spots. :(
1,dropped calls galore,"for $300 this phone should SHINE!! let alone it has a camera, voice recording capability, you can see a cute lil picture of the person that is calling... BUT YOU CAN""T HOLD A CONVERSATION PAST ABOUT 13-14 mins BEFORE IT DROPS!! i called T-mobile & was told to get the Motorola SIM card not the Nokia one. that hasn't helped one bit!!! for the amount of money (we got 3 of them; me, g/f & dad and we ALL HAVE THE same troubles)... you should be able to complete a call whether you are talking across the street or to china. SIM card didnt change anything. my 'OLD' & 'FREE' Nokia worked GREAT. battery didnt hold a charge. no camera & no color screen but i could complete my call with no probs... you be the judge.PS: And the camera isn't that great, i will stick with our Fuji S5000 thank you very much."
5,The fun phone,"i love the motorola v300 it is the best phone i had with t-mobile sp far it is a good phone i was able to get ringtones,games.and wallpapers this phone is the best the only thing I don't like is the vibrate/ring which vibrates and then rings all my phones had ring and vibrate at the same time this is phone is great i love this phone"
3,Not Disappointing......at first.,"I picked this phone because it looked cute, and seemed to have good features: camera phone, color screen. However, I soon came to realize it lacks many helpful features.You have to enter seperate phonebook entries for somebody's work, cell, or home phone. and that gets to be a pain.The camera is of very low qualityPersonally, I wish it had a sound option of vibrate and a ring tone. but those are featured seperately. The buttons on the side change the ring styles, but it sometimes changes it unexpectedly inside your purse or pocket.If you're looking for a light weight camera, this is not very heavy, but not exactly light.I recommend samsung phones, which i wish i had looked at before i purchased this phone"
3,Decent phone..lacks one very useful feature in LG phones,"I just got this phone yesterday, to replace my lg 5250 with sprint service (often problems with dropped calls, messages & voicemails coming 1-2 days late, customer service of not much help, etc..).The main reason I am writing a review this soon is because of one feature it lacks. I am able to put only one number with one name in the phonebook. This is a major limitation to me where most of my contacts have a work number, a home number, a cell phone, and a beeper. This means I have to put in their names 4 times and assign the numbers, as opposed to assigning the nubmers under one name with my old LG phoneI was somewhat surprised that I did not see this in the reviews before. Otherwise, I think this is a decent phone."
4,Overall Great Cd Rom,"This cd rom is really cool. The only problem is, it's only funif you have other people to play against. And even with the internet,it's impossible to find someone to play against..."
3,stress/accent mystery,"As a student of Russian and SC, I have to say that as to grammar etc., this book is quite good. I do have a problem with calling the book ""TY Serbo-Croation"" when it's mainly Croation with a few notes on Serbian. Prof. Magner's book covers the differences MUCH better. He also covers the accent/stress system much better. The TY book has no indications whatsoever as to which syllable to stress. In a language where stress is mobile (can be any syllable) this kind of lack of information is almost criminal."
3,a little editing would have made this a great resource,"Considering that this book achieved its purpose (i.e. I can now express/understand basic concepts in Croatian), I still have some criticisms to make. Principally, this book looks like it was never edited. There are zillions of mistakes and omissions. (Hey Dr. Dave, I suggest you look up the terms ""to affect"" and ""to effect"", in English). Not only are there grammatical errors in English (can't speak for Croatian but I have my doubts on ""dobar-dobra vecer""), but the book lacks in consistency. ALL words should be in the glossary, ALL verbs should be conjugated in their first person singular and past tense forms. This book is a mishmash. Very useful but would be MUCH MORE SO with a little work."
2,Teach yourself CROATIAN,"It IS a helpful book, but mostly deals with Croatian. Anyone trying to learn Serbian should really consider a tutor. This will get you some basics, but if you really have a strong need for the Serbian language, hang this one up!"
1,Waste of money,Bought this to use with my Motorola V220--been trying on and off for months to get it to install...will not connect to my hand set. Absolutely no good at all. The website and so-called user's manual are both useless. You can save yourself a lot of time if you just stuff $25 in the garbage disposal and turn it on...you'll get the same results in less time.
3,More Hood Films please,"An entertaining watch, but at the end of the day try to borrow this if you can. Production quality is low, a lot of material is repeated throughout the video, and the people protrayed seem fake or unrealistic. One guy looks like a straight up crackhead."
5,The very best telling of Ted Turner's unbelievable lifestory,"This long, intricately constructed, infinitely documented biography reads like a film script, which is the only appropriate format for a biography of this larger than life subject. Ted Turner has led a life only a Hollywood screenwriter could concoct, but Porter Bibb has packed it all between two covers."
5,Danze Premium Soap & Lotion Despenser,"This works great! My contractor installed it for me. It is so nice having the bottle off the counter. The top pulls off for easy refilling. The spring mechanism works well, and soap flow is fine."
2,Danze D495912SS - Soap Dispenser,As I see so many before me... I also opened the box to missing parts. I've been to one hardware store without any luck in finding a nut or washer to fit the plastic sleeve (not brass). Have tried the customer service line for Danze several times and each time hung up after waiting 20 minutes or longer. So far I'm not impressed with the quality or support.
2,missing parts!!!,Got this soap dispenser for a rental unit I have. Opened the box and went to install when I realized parts were missing. Washer and nut that conect and seal the unit onto the sink.
5,Very Charateristic of Frobergers music!,Anyone who has ever heard Frobergers music might be familiar with its particularily sombre tinge.this is why I choosed this one as my paragon of Frobergers music.here Mr LUDGER plays authentically and sumptuously on a very fine instrument which I personally consider as very appropriate for Frobergers music !A must for all early music fans!
4,Surprising good book with excellent characters...,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I anticipated reading this book after reading his Alienist....He does an excellent job of identifying characters and situations. I am only sorry he has not done any other books in this style, besides Alienist. I have had a difficult time finding an author with similar writings. Will just keep hoping he does another book in this time frame, and in this fashion."
2,"What an incredible disappointment after ""The Alienist""!!","As a person who raved to her coworkers and friends relentlessly about ""The Alienist"" being one of the best books of the past 5 years, I was overwhelmingly disappointed by ""The Angel of Darkness."" The story of Libby Hatch was intriguing, but the book plodded on and on until I was begging for it to be over. I normally would not even stay with a book that slow, but knowing Carr's previous work, I assumed there HAD to be something better coming. Perhaps if ""Angel"" had been a tighter, less rambling 350 pages or so instead of 750, it might have been enjoyable."
3,What the typos?,"I enjoyed the story for the most part (with one exception being a bit of psychological nonsense with regard to the villain that I just couldn't buy), but someone really should have proofread the Kindle edition. The number of typos is absolutely ridiculous. Unacceptable. Most would have been obvious if they had used a basic spell checker!"
4,A great sequel to the Alienist,"Its a great read for fans of murder mysteries, forensic science & the thrill of an investigative hunt. It's especially fun for those that of us that grew up or live in NYC. As you read its easy to visualize a turn of the century new york; I actually walked some of the very streets detailed in this book. Well worth the read. If you like this book I recommend ""The Alienist"" as well."
1,TYPO TYPOS & MORE TYPOS,Plot and story line very good however; this book was so full of typos and misspelled words that for me it was aggrevating to read due to the pages and pages of mistakes.
4,Better than The Alienist!,"I really enjoyed this book. Although The Alienist did a better job of recreating 19th century New York City, Angel was a far better ""read""! I do think it could have been about 150 pages shorter. However, the plot was engaging and well written."
4,"Quite engrossing but not as good as ""The Alienist""","I really enjoyed the Old New York feel of Mr. Caleb's writing. Again, the psychological pursuit of the suspect is engaging. I left it, however, not quite as satisfied as with ""The Alienist"", perhaps because the previous book was very fresh and this one, while still quite good, did not grow on the theme and/or process, but rather, was a continuation thereof. In short, very good but maybe a bit formulated."
1,complete waste of time,"if you read above the sixth grade level, don't waste your time with this book. walt disney, however, may want to make this book into a movie...for children...not adults. 700 pages of pure dribble."
4,"Not as gory, but still suspenseful","""The Alienist"" was much harder to put down, and ""Angel of Darkness"" still retains that quality. Mr. Carr definitely has a flair for being able to transport one to the past and he pulls no punches with this novel. His glorious descriptions of wondrous locations and characterizations of famous people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Diamond Jim make you feel as if you are there. The book isn't as gory as the last, but it'll make you sweat nonetheless. All our favorite characters return (Stevie Taggert, Cyrus, Mr. Moore, Sarah, The Doctor and the Issacsons) plus new interesting characters. The bit with Kat is a little drawn out and it'd be great if we could delve deeper into Libby Hatch's psyche, but we get the satisfaction of learning more about Stevie and the Doctor. ""Angel of Darkness"" is dark, funny, and suspenseful. A perfect combo for a great book."
1,Who kidnapped Caleb Carr?,"The Angel of Darkness reads almost like a parody of The Alienist. The first book made you feel like you were breathing in the stink of the Bowery, the sweat of The Tenderloin district. Roosevelt himself was quite believable, as was the whole description of New York, its people and places. With T.A.O.D., I felt like I had returned to the modern era, and was reading a goofy send-off of the first book. The capper is that last scene, with Roosevelt and the Navy Police storming through New York beating up the gangsters. Go Teddy! Rah Kreizler! Please, save the forced-upon climax for the movie-goers, but don't insult us readers with such treacle.Bah! The reason I haven't rated this a one is because it works as a fourth leg for my beat-up sofa rather well."
4,"Perfect blend of history, psychology and forensics.","If you're a student of science, as I am, and have a casual interest in the workings of the female mind, you will truly enjoy this historical glimpse into what is still a taboo issue of society today: a female serial killer. Carr has again taken us on a journey into the past using the archives and records of a time long since gone but still alive with the breath of memory. Though the book is quite long (+600 pages), it does not lack for texture and mood, especially when Carr describes the gangland territory that protects the murderess of the story. If you want bland, redundant description that serves no purpose, read Clancy. If you want to know how forensic techniques got their start, read this. Well worth the time taken to read."
3,"Rambling, contrived, evocative","This book was lent to me by a colleague, a fan of detective fiction, because she enjoyed the way Carr traces the history of forensics through his novels. That part of the book was interesting. But I hated the style of writing. That ""what"" used instead of ""who, which, or that"" just hit me the wrong way. The entry into the story of Stanton and the US Navy, of all things, took it over the top. The book was too long. I did find the relationships of the doctor, the policemen and the journalist to be interesting and wish there had been a bit more development of the forces that brought and held them together. I hesitate to recommend this to anyone who has to make careful choices about how to spend leisure time."
1,Most Over rated Author of the Year,"This is a real case of the emperor's new clothes. Caleb Carr got a good reputation for ""The Alienist,"" even though it was tedious and derivative and anachronistic. ""Angel"" is even worse-- so much so that, only 200 pages into its monumental 700+ page bulk, I got tired of waiting for the plot to start and dropped it. People who like these books probably haven't read this sort of thing done well: Jack Finney's ""Time and Again"" (NOT the sequel, ""From Time to Time"") comes to mind, as do several of Peter Lovesy's Sgt. Cribb mysteries. But Carr is a dull and pretentious author, and I say he's naked and to hell with him."
2,Carr's characters topple the carefully crafted construction.,"The Angel of Darkness attempts to take us into the world of a cold-hearted killer, but the reader is equally put off by the ""good"" characters. When did New York Times reporter become so whiny? Our trusty alienist is barely two dimensional; and little Stevie is too sugar-and-peaches wholesome to be a believable ex-thug. Though carefully researched, this book annoys more than fascinates. I kept hoping that the wicked Libby Hatch would knock some investigative heads to make it a little interesting, at least."
4,Gripping and entertaining,"As far as historical mystery story goes, this is a superb one. Carr captures both the decay and glamorous side of New York City of the 1890's. It is a well researched piece of work. The story started off with the kidnap of a baby girl from the Spanish Consulate and the ""team"" was drawn once again to track down the kidnapper. The story began to get intense from then on. Some parts of the plot are a bit unrealistic though, especially the bit where they got Teddy Roosevelt and the Navy involved. The final scene between Libby, the Doctor and Stevie is too Hollywood. How could they manage to have a meaningful conversation with a psycho when she was about to shoot. All in all, a good and a different sequel to ""The Alienist"" ."
2,The Angle of Disappointment,"Two of my generous four rating points for this book are dedicated to ""The Alienist"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. One point goes to the ""feel"" of a century ago. And one point goes to the fact that so much current fiction is worse than this book. That said, ""The Angel of Darkness,"" although it had its rare compelling moments, was a superficial, stereotypical, artificial, name-dropping embarrassment. ""Hey, there's Diamond Jim Brady! Ain't he fat? Did you see all the food 'what' he ate?"" It's a good thing Mark Twain isn't alive. Carr's premise for his novels works. Too bad he can't write for the reader, rather than the buck. Perhaps there should be ""term limits"" for professional reviewers too."
4,A beautiful Darkwave/Industrial album. A must have!!,"""Metropolis has done it again!"" which is what I would have said after I heard Teignmouth, but it is L.I.C.T.D. that makes Metropolis what it is. When I recently heard about Teignmouth, I had heard the sounds bites from the album, and liked the new wave sort of beats,in ""Wild World"",which had me order the cd. When I first heard the rest of the album (the first half of the album) it is ambiance with flowing trance-like female vocals, that are intoxicating, with a beautiful waltz-like fantasy in ""Structure"". There are male vocals that are introduced towards the middle of the album, which does not take anything away from the cd's atmosphere. There are a few dance-like songs,( if you are brave enough to dance to them) but overall Teignmouth is an essential album in any darklings collection. A must have for darkwave and ambiance fans!!"
5,The BEST !!!,"If you want the stuff you""re tying down to stay tied down, dont skimp on tie downs. Theese are the original and by far the best. The bargain basement types are just that, and will let you down at tyhje worst possible time. Spend a little extra for theese its well worth it!!"
5,As well-built as ever.,These are the best tie-downs out there. Still built as well as the first pair I bought back in the 70's.
1,Defective,"I like many, have been using the Ancra brand for decades for my Motorcycles. What I recvied today, was 1 pair, MADE IN CHINA with white goo all over them. I really question how they could leave any factory in that condition. Also how to you expect me or anyone to trust a $20,000 Bike with that kind of quality control? Thankfully I purchsed from Amazon and they took them back. Going to eBay to find a pair made in USA"
4,easy to install,"I have a single filter, but replaced it with two smaller filters, they fit in easily and have no problems."
2,Mint Chocolate Chip Michelin Man,"Wish these came as one large filter instead of these. With this kind of filter it looks like the Michelin Man when it is assembled. Also, the filter smelled like mint chocolate chip for about three days of heavy use. If you have severe allergies, you should consider a filter that doesn't smell out of the box."
5,A Testament to Excellence,"About 20 years ago, I read an older translation of this biography. Then, as now, a reader cannot help but be impressed by the thorough and meticulous scholarship that went into its preparation. Because of its size and scope (900+ pages), it may be somewhat daunting to new readers who may be just now encountering Bonhoeffer. However, given the nature of his literary output (Bonheoffer was still a young man when he died, and many of his ideas exist only in limited or underdeveloped forms), this in-depth look at the man and his motivations by the individual who probably knew him best is essential to an informed understanding of his work. For Bonhoeffer admirers, it doesn't get any better than this."
5,The Late Great DIVINE sings!!!,"This is a rare filmed concert of Divine Live in the 80's. This was filmed in London. I own this on video ,and it is a fun and racy concert. It shows Divine at her/his best in a Gay club with a live audience. Divine of John Waters cult films of the 70's and 80's shows off his er ample talents and performs some of his dance hits of the era. This is a great piece of history for all John Waters/ Divine fans!!!"
3,"Paris, Texas it isn't!","From the director who gave us ""Wings of Desire"" and Paris, Texas comes this very self-indulgent shallow tale.The ""look"" of the film is great (Butte, MT never looked so good) but the camera ""round de round"" shots (via Brian De Palma ad naseum) makes one sick after just a few minutes and completely ruins whatever little story there is to tell here. I really wanted to like this film, but could not - what an absolute waste of talent and energy."
1,Not Good,"This movie is so bad that I remember vividly the time I watched it, my energy level, the darkness around me, the people sleeping close by in a motel room, and finally, actually watching the special scenes of its debut in NY and the Sundance Festival. I was horrified at the repetitive and intrusive music, the miscasting of the son as Jessica Lange's son, the confusing plot, and the way-overacting of all the actors.It was a bad experience."
5,totally satisfying,"Naysayers, I found this movie totally enchanting and didn't want it to end. Excellent acting by the reliable Jessica Lange and Sarah Polley. This movie wasn't meant to take home 15 oscars - it was a whimsical, hilarious, refreshing, poignant, indie character study that hit on just about all cylinders. The cinimatography, the dialog, the pacing, the scenery, and most of the acting were all first rate.Howard was a putz - probably not unsimilar to many Hollywood actors young and old. Did you expect him to become enlightened by the end of the film? He stayed in character though he tried, squeezing Sky's hand gently. His children reaped the rewards when they came to terms with his shortcomings finding themselves in the process.More people need to see this film."
2,"Decent Basic Plot, Terrible Everything Else","The basic plot of this book should have been really interesting. Unfortunatly the author took a good idea and ruined it. The dialog of this book is some of the worst I've ever read. No character development other than the main character and he's not a believable character. After reading some of the other reviews, I have to agree with the guy that said the author was already thinking ""Action Movie"" in his head - one liners abound in this book. I am a fan of Clancy, Ludlum, etc and was hoping this would be a new series I could read, but no way."
2,The Lions of Lucerne,"This book came as highly recommended reading, but I was disappointed. Some parts were great reading, but others many loose ends. Scot Harvath is describe as a SEAL, experience Secret Service man, I don't understand how someone like that can make so many elementary mistakes in his pursit in staying under the radar and covering his tracks. Wouldn't he know there would be security cameras in the Ritz? Boring!!!"
2,Increasingly Unbelievable,"The book started off really well, decently detailed, very possible dialogue and a good plot. This goes on till about half the book, even the parts about Scot Harvath trampling on the crime scenes, having 'superhuman' strength so as to overcome his numerous injuries is acceptable. But when he escapes each and every assassination attempt, walks into pre-meditated gunfights poorly armed, lack of detailing as to his preparation which I would have expected to be a must as it's in the genre of factual based thrillers, all this just made it mediocre. If you want to read about a one-man-army but with a more plausible storyline, better detailed plot along the same concept of danger to the US president, read Transfer of Power by Vince Flynn."
3,Nine Years Later. . .Still A Worthwhile Debut,"Seeing this book on the bestseller lists again after so many years prompted me to re-read it ahead of the release of Black List in July.Brad Thor has improved considerably as a writer over the years, even if I wasn't a huge fan of the heavy political tone of Full Black. I wasn't overly impressed by Lions when I first read it, but it does lay the groundwork for what became a very solid series. Well worth the discounted price of $3.99.Pros: Lots and lots of action, high concept plot, and exotic locales.Cons: Flat characters and what can, at times, be painfully overwritten prose. The plot takes some very improbable turns, leaving the reader gasping in disbelief--and not the good kind. Fortunately, Harvath's character becomes more nuanced in successive books."
5,The Lions of Lucerne,"My book is called the Lions of Lucerne, and is about an ex-Navy SEAL Scot Harvath who has recently been drafted to the president's personal Secret Service team. He is in charge of the president's daughter, Amanda, on a ski trip. While there Scot's team is whipped out by an avalanche that was caused so that terrorists could make away with the president.Harvath has been framed for the killing of the Secret Service squad and the leak behind the presidents kidnapping, being the only survivor. He must find the real people behind this while almost being killed three times. He goes to Switzerland after finding many clues leading him here where he must climb mountains and kill or be killed."
2,Language/sexuality disappointing,"Read and really enjoyed ""The Last Patriot"" so wanted to get some previous novels by this very fine author. Downloaded the kindle version of Lions of Lucerne and found language and sexual scenes almost immediately that put me off and discouraged me from continuing further. Disappointing as he had not needed those elements for his very entertaining, more recent book. Wish I could have a refund."
5,Great Beginning,"I have read Brad Thor since The Apostle and I have enjoyed them all. So I decided to jump in and try the first book in the Scot Harvath series. I am very glad I did. This book was terrific. Normally, when you read the first book of an author, particularly in a series, the book has holes and flaws that are cleared up in subsequent books. Not this one. It was just as good as some of his more recent books. Highly recommended!"
3,First of the series,Wanted to begin at the beginning and this will get me to the next book and -- I suspect -- through the series as the writing and plotting get better. Friends have recommended these books and I'm anxious to give another a try.
1,not as good as most,"Scot has more lives than a herd of cats. Just keeps going no matter how incapacitated he is from all the many injuries that regularly visit his bod. Hard to stay on track after all the fancy escapes he pulls off despite being seriously injured many many times. Incredible. Stopped reading it halfway through, don't think I'll try another one of his. Give me something a little more believable, thanks."
3,Too wordy for this age group,"The illustrations and the story itself are appealing. But can a 4 to 8 year old picture book reader deal with text like this? ""Good food is certainly necessary for an infant chimpanzee, but just like a human child, Rickie needed affectionate contact with a caring adult. She needed love."" The same thought could have been gotten across better for this age group using easier and fewer words."
2,Disappointment,"My recent order arrived on time and in good shape. The book Blood Sugar Solution is excellent. Worth considering even of one does not have elevated blood sugar.However the CD by John Denver was a disappointment. Not the music, but several tracks on the CD would not play. After cleaning it and trying on several players with the same result, I gave up. There was no packing slip in the shipment, so there was no return authorization. I sent a letter to the return address on the package, but so far no response."
4,A good collection,"This is a good greatest hits for a starter CD. I have to admit I'm a bit both ways on John Denver, it's good honest country music. I love the hits of being a country boy.....but cringe at 'knowing his ladies pleasure' - argh.However I'll not offend fans, if you want a sample this is a great idea, or a good gift for a die hard fan."
4,Denver Collection Lives Up to Title,"Wonderful collection for anyone who wants the best of John Denver's many hits. I recently went to a John Denver review show with a friend and was reminded how touching and inspirational his music can be. Was going to pull a few songs off of iTunes, but decided my money was better spent on this collection. Was not dissappointed."
3,"Great classic, but needs more hip hop.","I don't know who researched this game, but gone is the original Frogger theme music and catchy tune as you play. The buttons help add to the response time for leaping, but only forward. But the graphics and game play are there, and that is what matters.Don't get me wrong, I like Frogger just fine, but more could have been done with this game. And the fact that it is a single game unit makes the boredom factor catch up to it quickly, unless you are a true Frogger addict. I returned this unit after I bought a similar joystick with about 5 games on it. Same Frogger translation on that as well.Of course, there is no educational value in this game. Why does Frogger die when he jumps in water? He's a frog! {;-PGreat for the Frogger lover, and probably handles better than the other joystick, but not worth more than 15 bucks on a generous day."
1,$20 for ONE whole game? What a ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's not even the arcade version. It's Majesco's crappy Gameboy version, and the same version that's on the Konami Arcade stick. It doesn't even have the right music. Why did they even bother?"
4,Same price as others but only has one game.,I bought this game for my son because I remember playing it as a child. It is a little advanced for him past the first stage but he loves to try. We have several of the Plug and Play games and I was a little disappointed that this one only has one game for the same price as the others which have 4 or 5 games.
2,Not the Chappelle Show,"Don't buy this if you're looking for ""Chappelle Show"" comedy. It's a documetary of a party, not near enuf funnyness per hour."
2,ehh.. good for a rental.,"saw this film in the theater, and i thought it was funny and all..but its the same tired formula...just think of stand up comedy..outdoors(a nyc city block to be specific) and you have the idea for this movie.. you got dave and his antics Some which are really funny..but if you want better laughs get the dvd sets of chappelles show...if you never saw this and have to check it out..just rent it and save your money for something better..like the directors cut dvd of car wash :) now thats classic!"
3,Loony Limericks Connects Kids to Poetry Form,"Uncle Switch; Looney Limericks makes a nice introduction to the genre for younger children. There are lots of terrific illustrations to support the mixed-up antics of Uncle Switch. This book offers several possible writing connections for the elementry school teacher - writing original limericks, other writing using the mixed-up way Uncle Switch has of doing things. Makes a good connection to Amelia Bedelia books, too."
1,Lack of Product Quality and Support,"I was given a VT 300 for Christmas. After some 20 - 25 short messages and 5 months later the unit failed to respond. I tried replacing the batteries ( 5 times with brand new Duracells) but to no avail. Upon calling VXI, the customer rep told me to initialize the unit, again to no avail. She further told me since the unit was older than 3 months she could do nothing. And NOTHING VXI did! Well a 3 - 5 month performance for the price IS NOT good for me. VXI keep your indifferent attitudes, your clearly inferior products and my money. Good bye!"
4,blue suede shoes - good times!,"This concert had a good write-up so I gave it a try. It was well worth the price! I only knew of Carl Perkins through listening to the title song many times on the radio. The gathering of key artists for this concert was a pleasant surprise on many levels. The rockabilly chord sequence got old fast though, but it was still a fun concert."
1,Won't work.,"I received this DVD early in June 2012. I read on the cover that it was made in Great Britain, but I didn't think it would make any difference playing on my equipment. Well, it did! I couldn't get it to play on either of my Blu-ray machines (one is 3-D capable), so I tried it on an older one I've had for 10 years. It began to play on that one, so I settled in on what I thought would be a great hour's worth of classic performances. Towards the middle of the disc, the pixilation and freezing became so prevalent that any further viewing was impossible. I sent it back to Amazon, but since they weren't the seller, I could only get a refund and not a working disc. That being said, what I was able to see of the show was spectacular!"
4,"Great camcorder, TERRIBLE software",Do not buy this camcorder for the software! The camera works great but buyer beware - the software is useless. Sony could have done a much better job than the Picture Package software that is included. Help from the Picture Package website is virtually non-existant. If you want to edit video you need a firewire (not included) - but DO NOT buy it from sony. They are much cheaper on Amazon or elsewhere. A USB cable is included but is also useles unless you can tolerate the Picture Package software. An extra battery is a nice addition as well. And of course some sort of software to replace the Picture Package junk.
4,Connolly's Second book: another entertaining story.,"A great book that, if you don't mind the cliche, you can't put down. Connolly's way of keeping you in suspence over Caleb Kyle, (does he exist?),how everything clicks into place at the end,makes for a fantastic climax. For fans of thrillers, this is simply a must. Jack Connolly will definitly be on my favourite authors list."
4,"Secret, painful pleasure","Reading Mr. Connolly's book is like taking a wild ride. The adrenalin is pumping, the heart is ticking faster and faster. People that he so livingly writes about are either deeply troubled and injured or just supernaturally evil. And that might be one and only complaint about his books. His vilains are barely human. They remind me of mythical ogres from old fairytales. Their power is superhuman, they don't age or weaken.The book loses some of its magic with the extremely inflated body count. It becomes some moody and bloody soap opera for the twisted souls.Needless to say I will read all of the Charlie Parker books. They are like a secret painful pleasure that is impossible to resist."
4,Better than an LED,"This is a great buy ... a little expensive for a bulb .... but it allows the MagCharger to claim and deliver 50,000 candlepower. No LED is going to do that. It preserves the focusing feature unlike some of the aftermarket LEDs. Just be careful when you insert the bulb ... it is easy to bend the leads if you use too much force."
3,sean,It just worked as expected but I believe the original bulb was far more brighter. Hope this will last over a year.
2,Dads are dumb,"After watching this movie, my 4 year started singing dads are dumb, dads are dumb- because that's all she could remember of the song. Sometimes pre-schoolers don't ""get"" the entire message of a song or movie. You may have to have a long discussion over the meaning of this movie, so be prepared!"
3,can't really tell the difference,"Honestly, I couldn't really tell any difference between this xenon bulb and the factory installed krypton bulb. Looking at maglite's website, it had a wide range of performance difference's between different size lights with xenon vs krypton and the 4 to 6 cell lights had only about 20% greater lumens, so not much of a difference in a nutshell."
2,very weak,"i thought that being a LED lamp it would emit a stronger light than the previous model but on the contrary, and i was using new batteries as well so it's a lamp problem for sure"
5,Fantastic,I wish more Blu-ray movies had the ultraviolet and DVD in it because this gives you more options to let your kids watch the movie.
5,Man needs to stop cutting down all the trees.,"Loved the Lorax, it has good saying for those who want to cut down all the trees.I liked the unless. It was a great movie."
2,This movie gets a very generous 2 from me,"For visuals alone. Even Danny DeVito (whom I normally love as a comedic/voice actor for animated films --- think Phil in Disney's Hercules) couldn't save it! It was pretty bad, and though an explosion of color and pleasing to the eye, that's about as far as it goes for The Lorax."
1,Bad movie!!,"Boring and propaganda filled. A truly awful movie. A really bad attempt to curry favor with radical environmental groups. Nothing interesting or fun about this movie. As my grand children said: ""this movie is sad."""
1,A great story poorly told,"I was really looking forward to this movie because I love the story, but this incarnation provided nothing but disappointment. The story was poorly written and badly told and the only reason the main character wanted to get trees back into the world was so he could score with the good looking girl that did actually have a moral center. The villain of the story was really the only interesting character the movie had and realistically the writers should have had mercy on us and let this remain a half hour television show."
1,Lorax needs to be lifted again,"OK, you might love the book although I personally think it is one of the poorer Seuss works. But this movie truly needs to be lifted out of here. It is, in one word, awful."
5,Gift for granddaughters,"Rented it first and it was not returned right away , My one granddaughter watches it everyday and laughs and laughs all the time. So I bought it for her and they sent the rental back. Very worth the money!!!"
5,A Favorite In Our Household!,"Oh my gosh, my children LOVE this movie - and I do too! I'm an eco-conscious girl, so the heart of this film makes me smile, but it's the songs and characters that I fell in love with. My kids adore the fun, catchy tunes and always get up to dance - okay okay, I do too! Seriously, the songs in this film are too fun. This is sure to be a favorite for any child (or child at heart) :)"
3,The Lorax,Good animation. But too many left-wing ideas that weren't originally in the book. It was over-whelming and a bit annoying .
2,Sickly sweet amount of singing,I had expected a lot from this movie based on the trailer. While the graphics were great the delivery was not. It would have been better if they spent more time on the story and dialogue and less on the cheesy songs that filled the entire movie. Even my 9 year old twin nephews couldn't handle it. The saving grace was the message it was trying to get across was a good one.
4,interesting,I had to buy the lorax movie even though I wanted to rent it first to see if I would like it. The movie was not for rental at that time so I had to buy it because my kids and I wanted to really watch it. I am happy though that I bought it because we enjoyed it very much.
2,BORING,"This movie was boring. BOR-RING! Okay, parts were okay. Parts. But for the most part....BORING. The only thing I can say is I didn't fall asleep. It was very colorful, also. HA!"
2,Anti everything movie.,"This movie is cute and if you can look past the messages in it you'll like it. It is anti capitalism, anti free enterprise, anti business, anti logging, etc... While my younger kids loved it my 13 year old, husband, and I hated it. My 13 year old said it makes all business look evil, and tries to indoctrinate kids. Not a fan."
5,Dr. Seuss movies rule,I took my niece to see this movie in theater and she walked out sing the little songs. I knew I had to get this when I seen it on sail it's just as fun now as it was in theater.
2,24 hours is too short,"The rental was too short to enjoy with my kids taking a nap every four hours. My three year old didn't get to finish the movie coz it was past her bedtime, by the time it was okay for her to watch again, the 24 hours has passed."
2,"Exagerated scenes, and sometimes not appropriate for the little ones","I've watched the old Lorax and I loved. The first movie is simple and teaches kindness to children. Therefore, I thought this new Lorax would be just as nice; I bought it for my child. When I sat down to watch the movie I was choked with the scenes of a boy and a girl (the boy likes the girl); it looked like scenes from "" the girl next door"" movie, something not appropriate for a child to watch. The movie is also so full of everything; confusing, and a little annoying, since you don't feel you've learned much at the end of it. I will definetly get rid of this dvd!"
3,Did not receive combo package,The Lorax is a great movie with many funny events. I was excited to receive the dvd combo package only to realize that instead I received a single dvd.There's only 1 disc in the case instead of 3 as stated. Very disappointed and hope something can be sorted out.
1,waste of time,"as pretty as this movie might be, there is nothing ""cute"" about it.read the bookwalk to work and schooldemand gmo labeling on your truffula fruitdon't watch this film"
1,Sick of children shows being used for political views,"It was a turn off of children's movies. It seems like most children's movies these days are being used to push some political point into my kid's heads. I'm sick of it, and I am going to be more careful of the movies I show my children from now on."
3,Typical Dr. Seuss,"A meaningful and relevant message delivered in typical Dr. Seuss fashion. Honestly, I fell asleep in the middle of it, but my kids enjoyed the music, the messages, and pipsqueak the bear."
4,very good dr seuss movie,"A good movie. I liked Horton hears a who, not as good as it though but still a good movie."
1,Warning: Instant Video is bad,About the movie. We love it.! It looks great on blu ray. Funny movie!About the instant video. Stay away from it. The quality is horrible whenever a lot of the animation is being played on both pc and on the tv. I am very disappointed with the instant video and I am unable to get a refund from it. The quality of the movie is bad on Instant video.
2,Brainwash,"The Lorax is a rather unvarnished brianwashing for young children to convince them that corporations are bad. The art and character are charming and some of the positive values are not bad. The denegration of family and business is, however, unacceptable in a moive aimed at impressionable minds."
5,movie,This is a very good quality DVD and it came very quickly in the mail. My 3 year old grandson loves it!
5,Hahhahahahaha,"i loved it,it was so adorable and the songs were catchy. I ended up buying it because i saw the ending of it at my dentist and i wanted to see the rest of it so i did. Totally worth it :)"
5,Great Movie,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it. Shipment was fast and I would def rec this movie for all ages.
4,True to the Spirit of the book.,"Don't let the hypocritical advertizing campaign turn you off of this new Dr. Seuss adaptation. Although the film, inevitably includes a lot of padding to make a 72 page book into a 90 minute feature but the movie retains the message of the original book. The movie has some pretty catchy songs and their aren't too many slapstick jokes and attempts to be ""hip""."
2,Disappointing,"I loved The Lorax as a kid. i loved the book, and I loved the cartoon that would come as an evening special on network tv. I was extremely excited when I saw it would be made into a full length film, and couldn't wait to see it. I would have watched it in the theatre, but I couldn't swing the funds at that time, and when I could I had other things I needed to do.So when it came available to rent online, i did it. I was pretty disappointed. Not so much for the story, or anything that was great, and that is why it got two stars. The songs ruined the whole movie. It would be one thing to have intelligent, humourous lyrics to add to the film. That would have been ok. However, the songs were inane, idiotic and did not add anything to the film. In fact they were very irritating, and as I stated before ruined the whole thing. If you want to watch it, that is your choice...however I will not be purchasing this film."
5,We could learn a lot here.,"First of all, let me say that the service from this provider was spot on. The film came in perfect condition and in a timely manner.About the film...The Lorax is a film on the environment. That could sound boring but, let me tell you, it is not. It's sort of in the form of a parable and doesn't shove the environmental theme up your nose but, instead, in a perfectly delightful way it raises our awareness (and the awareness of our children) about wanton waste of the things of the earth.Great film with a great message. I highly recommend it."
5,Great for every age,My entire family loves this movie (especially my 4-year-old). Family-friendly for all ages and great catchy songs. Good message behind the story also.
5,The Lorax,Dr. Suess has been a favorite of mine for a long time. The movie followed the book quite well and added some more to make the movie entertaining.
4,"Entertaining, Good message, & Worth a watch","This movie was completely different than what I thought it was going to be about. Not a bad thing, just different. I was pleasantly surprised to find it has a great meaning. It's got some witty humor & memorable characters. Definitely worth a rent, but I would recommend a buy! The kids will surely not be disappointed!"
2,Painful to get through,"Upbeat songs, but it is pretty boring. Lots of hitting and knocking over characters for humor. Basically the same message of Wall-E, in a much lower class-form."
2,Ruined a class Seuss story....,"My family really enjoyed the original version of this story and were somewhat excited to see the remake. We purchased it and were very disappointed. It certainly isn't like the original so if that is what you were hoping -- a more modernly produced version of the original -- you will be disappointed. We found the movie to have musical numbers and themes that were busy and unclear to the original story or message. The movie was definitely, in our opinion, created to try and appeal to a different demographic than the original (older kids - perhaps early teens?) The rating should have been a give-away and did make us wonder at first about the remake.In short.... if you really liked the original you probably won't care for this version. Anyone want to buy a lightly viewed version of this release?"
1,"One Star, glad we didn't purchase this one!","My kids are stating this review.""it was boring. It was not at all funny except for the fish"" This didn't live up to despicable me, which my kids love.*"
5,The perfect movie,"My kids love this movie and so do we. The book was great, but now with the songs they sing them and ""act out"" The Lorax by pretending to save the trees. They want to plant a lot of trees now, which is great since we have the acreage to do it."
1,The book is better.,"All I can say is that I was disappointed with this and I really, really wanted to like it. The new story it was embedded in took over and much of the original impact was lost. Not a bad movie, but if you loved the book you may want to rent this movie first and think about buying it later. Wish I had."
1,This is not what you think,"As the previous reviewer stated, this product is very misleading. I purchased it and found out it was nothing more than the publicly available UAV Roadmap (google) and some web pages hastily thrown together. My son could have compiled this stuff and given it to me free."
3,A Semi Useful Toy,"I have been running the Minstrel S for about 2 months now and I have to say the service is great, if you can find it! When you use the Minstrel S you feel like you are a ghostbuster trying to detect ghosts, but the ghosts are the service provider signals needed to support your ""new"" toy!! I call it a toy still because it dosn't work more often than it does, but when you have a connection you now know you are in the new Milenium. Don't get me wrong the Minstrel S is great when it works, there are few things like it, but getting a signal is tough. You would figure that in a airport you would have service, guess again. OmniSky has to get better coverage before this toy becomes a tool!!!"
4,A Crowd Pleaser!,"I can't believe I'm the first to reviw this book! I have found the information and references in this book to be very good. In most cases Ivars Peterson is one of the best new science and mathematics writers that I know of! I'm interested in chaos and fractals, but mathematics also is in this book. There seems to be a little of everything. There is even work by Mandelbrot that I hadn't read about. I can only fault that he didn't put in enough of the equations and code to produce the examples. Also a glossary of terms would be helpful. But it is a very good buy in paperback!"
2,Not a good product,"I bought this thinking that it would be a great combo seeing as though it was designed for the monitor and I also needed another speaker set. In a nutshell it is poor quality. I noticed that another user's experience is filled with crackling speakers. This is what I have as well. Out of the box the speakers crackled, I felt as though it had to be defective, apparently not, since other users are experiencing the same problem. The volume is really terrible as well. I have to have the speakers all the way up the whole time to hear anything well. Stay away from this item. I feel ripped."
3,eH..,They look and sound good but went the right ones for my monitor.. maybe I can find another use for them
5,The Beauty Buyble: The Best Beauty Products of 2007,"I enjoyed reading the book, very nicely done...and who can resist all the many samples from the variety of sources! I found both the book and samples very useful."
4,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK,"The authors do a great job reviewing the best beauty products available. They give you the best by cost, then give their favorite and like in life, the best isn't always the most costly. So yes, go nuts over the free goodies that come with the book, but read the book. You may find that hand cream or lipliner of your dreams."
1,What a rip-off!,"I bought this, thinking the ""samples"" would be of products available in my country (USA).Most of them are miniscule samples in foil packets from companies selling outside the US. A Maybelline sample for lipstick was one of those cards found in a magazine.I don't mind wasting money on make-up, but this is an absolute scam.Oh, the enclosed book is dime-store drivel. Any person who's picked up a mascara knows more than what is in the book."
5,Amazing bag,"I travel for a living so having the right bag was very important. I had a very expensive ($400) computer bag but in the end, it didn't last nearly as long as I thought.I purchased this bag about a year ago. To this day, this laptop bag has held its shape and has taken a lot of travel abuse. It still looks in a new condition and has lots of pockets/storage zippers for files etc etc.I can't believe it is now around $100. When I bought it, it was around $70. I should have bought another one at that time.I strongly recommend it. It is built solid. The wheels, which are generally the first thing that goes bad, still holding strong. Every 90 or so days, I spray the wheel bearings with WD-40 lubricant. Other than that, its pretty much maintenance free. Its lightweight and stores fine in the overhead storages of the plane as well as under the seat of the plane."
4,Profound and inspirational,"This is a magnificent book. The author, Estelle Frankel is a gifted and brilliant spiritual teacher and guide. Her spiritual stories are profound and inspirational. However, for me, her tales/vignettes as a psychotherapist, especially in the first two thirds of the book, greatly weakened it. It it were not for the psychotherapy tales, it would have clearly been a 5 star book for me. However, I highly recommend it for the beautiful spiritual teachings."
1,Waste if Time,"The book in itself is boring from start to finish, there is no true story telling, and most of the book is used to blatantly attack the German people as a whole."
3,Works with Mac OS X,"The wheel and right mouse button do work, under Mac OS X anyway.It's kind of neat at first but there are really too many different kinds of sounds for it to make sense -- for example, in Diablo II, it mostly ends up vibrating when your mage henchman casts a spell, which is once every .75 seconds.I also only bought it because it was free with the rebate. Of course I lost the rebate form. Which is pretty much what they were counting on."
1,Don't buy this mouse.,"I purchased this mouse in September 2001. There was supposed to be a full rebate which I never got. I have contacted the company regarding the rebate, and haven't gotten an answer. Not only have I been waiting 5 months for the rebate, the mouse itself is a disappointment. I would have returned it if I hadn't applied for the rebate that I did not get. It freezes up so often, it isn't worth the aggravation to use it. I had to purchase another mouse to replace it. It was a complete waste of money."
2,Not half as good as the first one.,"If you lkied thehumansconditioned a lot, you may be a bit dissapointed. The drowned out distorted lyrics are too drowned out this time, and it lacks the creativity and originality of the first one. Still, there's a few good tracks..."
3,Written before digital,"This must have been a very good book for beginners ten years ago. Detailed text and good photos. However, with the advent of digital a lot of the text is no longer useful. Sure some things can be translated, but hey isn't that the author's job? Sure, the pictures are still inspiring and useful. If there's a new version you might consider it. But not this version.I just bought my first DSLR camera. I bought ten photography books on amazon. I'm evaluating these books from the perspective of a semi-advanced amateur."
1,"Great pictures, not-so-useful information","I love John Shaw's pictures (they're very inspiring!). However, I didn't find the book useful. Subscribe to a decent forum on the web, and you'll find more relevant, up to date and detailed information than what's found in this book. Check out wikipedia, or g**gle any question you may have. Don't spend your money on this one or on Shaw's Lanscape Photography.If you want to learn nature composition check out this one: The Art of Photographing Nature by Martha Hill (Author), Art Wolfe (Photographer). That one is a timeless book for budding photographers."
5,Very Good Book,"I must say this book has exceeded my expectations. So far the best book I've red. It is very well and understandably written. Very nice pictures. Yes, it is true that John describes usage of an analog camera, but the exposure principles are very well applicable to the Digital SLRs. I find it very useful especially for beginners. I believe also advanced users may benefit."
5,A fascinating and enjoyable book,"This is a beautifully written biography of Naples. I found myself drawn into this book and could hardly put it down. Not only is it an enjoyable read, this book is well-suited for a wide audience -- from armchair travelers to academics. Despite its rich and fascinating story, Naples has long been overlooked as a subject in the English-speaking world. Having read numerous histories of Florence, Rome and Venice, I was excited to finally find a history of Naples. Kudos to Dr. Lancaster for so wonderfully bringing the story of Naples to life!"
4,Innovative and functional product,"Very useful product. Does exactly what it said it would do. Shipping & handling were on the high side, nearly exceeding the cost of the item."
3,"Helpful for the inexperienced, but beyond that it's doubtful.","Cliff Atkinson has written an interesting book. To his credit, he is doing his utmost to wean people away from bulleted PowerPoint presentations. His approach is interesting: a logic tree that essentially allows the author to build from five minute to longer presentations.For the neophyte, Atkinson's approach would probably yield a marked and immediate improvement in their PowerPoint presentations. However, it is arguable that Atkinson's formula might not become as stale as the bullet points he inveighs again.Atkinson's book absolutely won't hurt, especially for the person who has no formal training in writing or presenting. But that same person might want to check out Edward Tufte's self-published works as well.On the whole, Atkinson has turned out a usable, but not stunning approach to delivering better PowerPoint presentations.Jerry"
3,GOOD AND INORMATIVE,THE BOOK WAS GOOD IN GIVING A GOOD VIEW OF WHAT THE SUBJECT DOES AND THE SCOPE OF IT SO THAT THE LEARNER CAN GRASP THE IDEA OF THE SUBJECT BUT FOR THOSE WHO WANTED TO DO SOME APPLICATION OF THE SUBJECT RELEVENT TO CERTAIN CASE THEN THIS WILL BE NOT THE BEST OF CHOICES IN MY VIEW THANKYOU YOURS SINCERELY KRISHNA ADURTHY M.TECH INDUSTRIASL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT IIT KHARAGPUR V.S.HALL OF RESIDENECE ROOM NO A-113 WEST BENGAL 721302 INDIA
5,"SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING BLUE...","This is absolutely one of the best albums put out independently this year. If Patsy Cline and Socrates got together and had a kid, it would have been Amber Rubarth... a very old fashioned feel mixed with some deep lyrics about ideas that the greatest minds have taken to throughout time.I ran across this album after hearing some rave reviews from a friend and am absolutely glad that I got it. I give it 5 Stars and recommend it to anyone who likes great music and sultry vocals."
4,The Best Blues Clues Tape,The Planet Song puts this song over the top. It's catchy and kids will learn all the planets in order.
4,A journalist goes native,"I loved this book. The author manages to essentially go native while preserving her journalistic acuity. Yet she writes with the lyricism of a novelist. The result is a lovely book full of joy and sadness, and giving unique insight into the particular challenges of growing up Afghan."
2,Dreadfully Truthful,"This, too, was a book club selection that I did not choose to read. It was difficult to get through due to the harshness they have to go through over there."
4,Enlightening,"The Bookseller of Kabul was an enlightening book. In the west, we have heard about life in Afghanistan from numerous sources. Many of these are propaganda-laden, but some have seemed to be more accurate description of life within the country. The Bookseller of Kabul, along with An Unexpected Light by Jason Elliot, have been openings into what life is truly like within this most restrictive country. This made The Bookseller of Kabul an eye-opening and enlightening read."
4,Great personal story,"I read books for content rather than style so I really enjoyed this book. Because of her word choice I was able to delve into the book and not think about the writing. Her information was well sorted through, unlike what I would have been able to do if I had the same experience. I enjoyed her lack of agenda and recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about a typical Afghan family."
1,A narrative asking for mercy,"The book is mostly written to ask reader to give mercy to the people who mostly wanted to live a better life without struggling for it. The question we now ask ourselves as reader of this book is that, should ""quarter be given"" to those lives in that city Tijuana just because the author felt simpathy for them ?. If you just a moment take a look at the crime rate in America and look at the condition of that city Tijuana, do you want to have that type of crime in this country.I am sorry that I wasted my money on this book. If you really want to read about poverty, I suggest that you read some real author like Henry Mayhew, or Jack London may be instead of this book."
4,Very Unbelivable,I am 15 years old and i enjoy books that shock me and are true. It makes me feel lucky to have a place to sleep. This book is great it makes you appreciate others in a way you never had before.
3,Infectious Greed- Here to stay,Great historical perspective of the out-of-this world greed and borderline illicit trading that began in the 80s...if not before.Problem is this is a tedious book of complex financial terms and stories. Requires patience and end result in my opinion is a presage of a bigger meltdown yet to come.
2,Cheese,"This being one of the more formidable :W: releases it captures ""12 reasons why i love cheese"" feeling, however it's not all that bad if you consider it a techno (with cheeseypees on top) cd, rather then ""industrial""...."
3,The Fabric of a Man,"This stage play originally starred Shemar Moore of Criminal Minds, Birds of Prey, The Young and the Restless, the Alaye calendar series.Darrin DeWitt Henson does a pretty good job of carrying his own, but the play is so rife with stereotypes that I give it 3 stars because of Henson and Mari Morrow, who is so underrated. See her in Divas with Khalil Kain."
1,"oughta be called ""HOW TO SELL OUT"" - Avoid!!!","this book basically says it's ok to chase a man, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to start sleeping with him before you are in an exclusive relationship. you should hit on the man to he doesn't have to risk rejection himself. if you are a natual born floozy - then this will hit home. if you have a sense of tradition whatsoever, know what real romance is about, know your worth - it will nauseate you.i found a few pointers in the very beginning to be true, but also pretty obvious - dating is somewhat of a numbers game etc."
1,COMPLETE [junk]!!!,"Please don't waste your money. I actually think the two authors are writing their own ""rave reviews"" on this piece of [junk]. I borrowed this book from a friend after having read ""How to Succeed with Women"" (another atrocity by the same authors) out of morbid curiousity. I didn't think anything could possibly be worse than ""How to Succeed with Women"" but I was wrong. This is horrid. The entire advice of these oh-so-brilliant authors is basically to put your meat on the seat or put your feet on the street. It completely caters to the Neanderthal in every man - even encouraging women to put out whenever possible...now who is this book really for I ask you?I find it interesting that the 5 star reviews came from men...wow...what a surprise. Believe me, anything above 1 star claiming to have come from a female reader is a lie. Women don't need to be told how to succeed with men...we do that by breathing."
2,Eh...,"Im a big fan of the guys and gals over at Scorpisces Records but Im not a big fan of the new Our New Year EP. Or Our New Year in general. They whine a lot and their concerts are really boring (no one dances). But they put on a good light show, that must count for something, right?"
3,It's just ok.,"I'm not overly impressed with these guys. They sound like every other ebm band on the Metrop., label. I guess if you just want another band to add to your Cd collection this would be for you, but if your looking for anything new and exciting this isn't it. Just another three star band in the vast sea of three star wonders."
4,"Nice Book, but...","This is an excellent book. It may be considered a kids' book, but it deals with many adult themes such as drug use, child abuse, murder, etc. The book is thrilling and should be made into a movie (if it hasn't already). I would recommend this book for people ages 11-14."
4,A Great Adaptation,"Whenever someone decides to make a movie adaptation of a book, fans of the book cringe. The tendency of directors to ""adapt"" the story line for the on screen version can often leave a bad taste in people's mouths. Luckily, Andy Wilson did a fantastic job staying true to the text. With no real story line changes and only a handful of noticeable omissions for the sake of time--remember it often takes Peake 50 pages to describe a 2 minute sequence--I think Peake would have been pleased.The cast did an excellent job and I was thrilled by the performance of the actors. Steerpike, the Countess and Prunesqualler all shine in their depiction of the characters. The immensity of Gormenghast is wonderfully portrayed through the use of special effects.Read the books first, and this movie will compliment them well."
1,Needs a decent DVD treatment,"I'd give the BBC production 5 stars, but the DVD release only gets 1 star because they chopped a widescreen production down to pan and scan. They were probably trying to make Walmart happy, but it's a shoddy way to treat a piece of art."
3,Turn Down the SOUND,"I've never been able to get through Mervyn Peake's Gormanghast books, so was interested and pleased to be able to watch a BBC production. It is definitely beautiful to look at, and I have no complaints with the characterizations (inasmuch as I've never read them), but why, oh why, did everyone have to SCREECH and SCREAM all the time? Was that in the books? Carumba! I cringed everytime the Secretary appeared, hysterically shouting--everyone shouts! It undoubtedly reduced my viewing pleasure; I began to focus on the irritating roaring instead of the characters, scenery and plot. Too bad, especially for something that was obviously such a labor of love."
2,Awfully boring.,"The costumes and art direction are very good, but the characters are very stale and boring. The main character, Mr. Steerpike, is a mad ambitious conniving Hamlet-like character. The actor who plays Mr. Steerpike, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is embarrasingly bad. The overacting in the movie is so awful, I am ashamed to admit that I watched through the entire production. I have not read Mervyn Peake's series on which this movie was based, but I can absolutely recommend reading the novels instead of watching this sorry piece of filmaking. What a waste of time, talent and money! Barf!"
1,Avoid the pan and scan travesty,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie . . . on TV, where it was broadcast in widescreen format. Then somebody had the bright idea to butcher it with a pan and scan DVD transfer. This movie will be worth buying, when it eventually shows up in the original widescreen aspect ratio."
2,Lack of catchy beats and sharp rhymes,"Before I lash at this cd, all must know that I am a huge Aesop fan. This cd has a real lack of well everything.. The beats are so simple and the rhymes just do not make par. Maybe comparing this album to labor days is unfair. The album lacks a real 'good' song. Mars Attacks is the only song that stands out. This cd has little depth and his voice just isnt accented as well as it could have been. I would Recommend Labor Days instead."
5,Who's this cat Dalton Higgins think he is---well U SUCK,"Hey Dalton Higgins boy why don't you try writing a better editorial review for my man aesop rock??what the hell does he have to do with faboulous??Fab sucks so much,sucks donkey d*ck.Also aesop rock is in no way a back pack rapper.You don't even know what that means obviously.What is it U egerly ask??Underground mc's/djs/producers who are even more underground and still be workin their way up to the top, from the very bottom, on their own, idependently without some damm label tellin em what the hell 2 do.Now write a new editorial review or i'll have to pull out my electric GAT on you.Got that cat?"
5,Collage rap at it's best!!!,"first off don't go expecting getto hip hop from the hood on n Aesop Rock Cd that's ot what Aesop's all about. Aesop Rock makes music from te inde or collage crowd and that's a good thing on his latest CD. On this hi 4th release Aesop proves again why he is the best Rapper on the inde scene.5 reasons this is a must have CD for the indie rap crowd1 The best Rapper on the scene2 top notch cameos from Camp-Lo, P.F.A.C, mr. lif and El-Pthree tracks with the best producer in the busness Blockhead as well as traks with other prodction by El-P but mostl fine work by Aesop himself3 A rare CD going for no hip hop radio play4 more top notch lyrics from esop and otherslast but not least a cool bonus sampler or mix come with the CDfor these reasons I say Congratulations to Aesop Rock and the Def Jux Crew on one of the top CD's of the year and deffinitly te top Rap Cd of the year and I'm not just saying that because I'm related to one of the prducers (Blockhad)"
2,I'M SORRY AESOP ROCK-,"I AM A HUGE FAN OF AESOP ROCK. HE HAS A UNIQUE VOICE AND FLOW. but- since this rating is of this release- which includes raps/lyrics & beats- it gets a low rating. there is no real message and sometimes gets a little long-winded. boring. and what's with the production? i'm sorry- there's no excuse- he has connections- use them! the production made this cd a waste of money. el-p stule of beats really don't go well with aesop rock. el-p should stick with cannibal ox- that's a perfect combo! anyways- aesop needs fakts-one, or blockhead. i still think he is a great lyricist. has a flow that can go very slow then go at the speed of light. but- this sucked. sorry.check out his older stuff- they're great!"
5,"One Of The Best, If Not The Hardest","This may not be the hardest of all Wumpscut releases, but it is one of the best. Indeed it contains one of the best Wumpscut songs of all time: the haunting, and poiniant ""Tell Me Why"". Get this if you like quality industrial and are not concerned with how loud and fast a song is, but rather are more concerned with whether it's good or not."
4,Rudy's Talent,"B7 is a great album, definitely one of my all-time :W: favorites (as well as my first). There's a great diversity of sound on this album, as well as good production. Stand-out tracks include Capital Punishment (starts out slow, with Rudy speaking against an ambient backdrop, but picks up bigtime with excellent melody souped up with cool distortions), and Thorns (Rudy's greatest work in my opinion, this decievingly simple track is simply beautiful).This is a great buy, and I'd recommend it to anyone just getting into Rudy's stuff. My other favorite :Wumpscut: CD would have to be Born Again, which is also an incredibly well done CD."
4,wumpscut wumps a**,"A phenomenal album. It is as if KMFDM and Skinny Puppy crashed together and were the better for it. Specifically, tracks 1-14 rule. Once you have listened to this cd you will no longer be able to sleep at night with dreams of NIN albums dancing in your head, but instead your mind will be lost in the soundscapes of this album. Madness awaits for those who call for it."
5,This album is the best,"Bunker Gate 7 is the my favorite Wumpscut album. The c.d. is solid and you do not come across a song where you feel you want to skip over it. A lot of songs have a hard edge to them blasting Rudy's madness out of your speakers but there are also well placed slower paced songs that do not take away from the album. If you are trying to get into Wumpscut, I would definitely recomend this album for your first."
3,"Some good, some boring","This is a compilation of Twain's shorter works and essays. Some of them are still very funny, others have lost context with the passing of years, and are somewhat boring. Someone praised the defense of Harriet Shelly -- I found that one boring, but then I care little for poetry and thus find the crass behavior of an ancient poet of little interest. ""Mastering the Bicycle"" was very funny. This book also has ""The War Prayer"", which though I already had in another compendium of his work, has always been one of my favorites of his short works. All in all, a useful addition to my Twain library, and the type of book one just has to grab when it is available. Read what you like, pass over the rest."
2,Too industrial,"Couple of decent songs, but most are too mechanized to be very listenable for most. A certain group may love it, but dance industrial, nin fans, kmfdm fans etc probably won't get much out of it."
4,Hottest Chick in the Nick Game,"I bought this product for my daughter in the hopes of having some nice tail to look at while she watched TV. Originally i thought the brunette was the best, turns out red is my thing."
2,THIS SALE$$$$$????????$$$$,"THIS SALES ASKING FOR OVER 100.00$ ITS A GOOD PRINTER, IV HAD 2 THEM MOSTLY FOR MY PHOTO WORK--ITS NOTHING SO SPECIAL--- OTHER ADS SALES EXACT SAME ITEM - AS LOW AS 19.00$IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION,WAY OVER CHARGED $$ MUCH TO MUCH$"
4,Excellent EBM with jungle flourishes,"Extremely listenable and original industrial; Haujobb put together a multitude of genres (jungle flirts with more straightforward industrial on a few tracks) not necessarily to fill dancefloors. Nonetheless, this is an essential cd for those tired of the genre exercises currently cluttering industrial; alternately darkly atmospheric, pummeling, and beautiful, this album revisits the equally good material on ""Solutions for a Small Planet"". The bonus cd (which by a manufacturing error only has four tracks) allows those with a sampler or mod tracker to create their own tunes: every sample used to create ""Solutions"" is here to plunder."
2,Disappointing,"Was expecting better but was rather disappointed. In comparison with the music to Ka, I personally thought that 'O' was rather dreary and unlikely to lift the spirits. Shame really. Great show not matched by the music."
5,'Tis my favorite!,"Funny thing is, I haven't even seen the show for ""O,"" but I have had this album for 5 years now and it has quickly grown to become among my favorite albums of all time. This is probably my favorite cirque du soleil album. While it is versatile in different styles with a clash influence of popular and classical music, such sweet harmonious sounds and a tasteful blend of timbres create a colorful soundtrack to what I could picture to be an incredible show. If they will ever do the show ""O"" again I'm gonna see it. ""Africa"" and ""Remous"" are especially good, as they show much contrast in dynamics, texture, style, and timbre, as well as interpolating background effects to create a vision that one is in Africa during the night. ""Gamelan,"" ""Ephra,"" and ""desert"" are very well written songs, as well as the title track itself. If you love their music, this is definitely the cream of the crop."
2,MYSTERE IS THE ONE-NOT O,"THE MUSIC HERE IS FRANKLY BORING. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR CIRQUE DU SOLEIL AT ITS' BEST THAN BUY MYSTERE. SEE MYSTERE AS WELL IN LAS VEGAS. THE SPECIAL EFX ,STAGING, IS GREAT BUT, IF YOU'VE SEEN OTHER CIRQUE SHOWS THIS IS KIND OF A SNOOZE."
1,WOW - the enthusiasm over this show and album is SAD,"I am an avid fan of Cirque du Soleil, having seen every show except for 'La Nouba,' and was so incredibly disappointed by this one. Sure, the staging was completely amazing, but let me tell you something about how boring the whole thing is. As far as the music goes, compared to the other albums, this one is so completely bellow their level. BORING being the opperative word. When in Vegas, save the cash you'll pay for 'O' and take it to a REAL show: Cirque du Soleil's 'MYSTERE' at the Treasure Island. The seats cost less, and you'll be in for an awesome experience.PS - If I could give it no stars i would."
3,Bible Review,The KJV portion of the bible should be updated to the NAS or NLT to make it easier to read and understand. The explanation comments at the bottom of each page are very good. I believe the comments are the best part of this study bible.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Book of the Dead is basically a horror short story collection. There is nothing particularly memorable about any of them, although the story about the girl getting the ability to go owl-woman isn't bad. Vampire owls though? That is a little on the whacky side.For those that are pretty keen, only, although it is not bad."
5,"Noah, Build Your Boat","This is a most wonderful introduction to the story of Noah through writings and drawings of this Old Testament story.The editor, Jeff Kunkel has an amazing rapport with children so this book is nothing less than a gift of love from the children. Buy it. It's well worth your time if you have a little one learning about the Bible."
5,Anime music at its best,"I love the songs from Marmalade Boy! I don't understand japanese but the songs makes you wanna listen, dance, think! Some are very relaxing and some are upbeat but all of them are great! My only disappointment is thatit wasn't available for MP3 downloads.Anime lovers will not be disappointed!"
4,He never did learn how to hit a curve ball.,"Baseball and international espionage, how can you improve on thatcombination? If you have enjoyed other baseball books like George Will's ""Men atWork"" and also like to uncover little known pieces of the puzzleof history, this is a masterfully crafted presentation of thelife of one of the pivotal but lesser known ""players"" inWorld War II era national security during. Moe Berg is a hero andan example to all of the power of the individual and initiative."
4,Family and IQ produce very eccentric spy,"While much of the text speaks of baseball, spies, andunusual social behavour, the backround information tellsenough to show how all this came out of a home where thefather was not only absent but also had some ratherunusual ideas and attitudes about his own identity. If youare not overly consumed by the enlightening stories ofbaseball and spying, and pay attention to the glimpses offamily, it is facinating to see how Berg's family couldproduce such an unusual character as Moe. His use of hisintelligence makes him seem similar to today's stereotypicalgeek engineering nerd, only directed more at the humanitiesthan the technical. An easy and interesting read about avery unusual individual."
3,Entertaining read,"This is a good, book, but not a great book. I laughed out loud throughout. Although it is definitely John Green's weakest work, it is still very entertaining."
2,Alright yet disappointing,I personally would not recommend this book. The ending was very predictable and many of the thoughts and actions of the narrator seemed very repetitive. I feel the book's theme and the narrators character had potential but the book itself did not deliver. The book book was well written aside from the fact it was very repetitive.
1,One Bubble Off,"I purchased this laser level last winter but did not take it out of the box until early July, when, I discovered, one of the leveling bubbles filled the entire glass. No way can a person work with that, so I sent an e-mail to Berger, the manufacturer, only to receive a blizzard of jargon-filled, unhelpful e-mails in return. Berger's excuse for a possible problem? That the level may have sat too long in Amazon's warehouse before shipping. Say what? Sitting in a warehouse damaged it? So, instead of boxing it up and sending it back to the factory and reading another bunch of hideous e-mails, I'm going to throw it in the dumpster, where it belongs."
3,A well filmed sequence of interesting events,"A well filmed sequence of interesting events, but lacking a hook, or characters in whom I felt invested, or sufficient narrative drive for me to really call it a story."
3,A wanted man returns home,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Classe tous risques, is a film based on a novel of the same name, about a gangster named Abel Davos, who returns home to France after hiding out in Italy.I was not very familiar with the film, and despite its obscurity, I found it to be quite good.The supplements are French and English theatrical trailers, an archival interview with actor, Lino Ventura, an interview with the novelist José Giovanni, and a biographical documentary on the film's director, Claude Sautet."
4,I have a confession...,"Being a TSM fan for 4 or 5 years, I bought this cd the week it came out. When I popped it into my cd player i was really disappointed at it....and I ended up selling it about 2 days later :( but I burned it just in case. After about 2 weeks of not listening to this cd i popped it in and wow it was amazing. I'm so pissed off i sold this amazing cd! It's a bit more harder than previous TSM releases but its really good. Just give it a few listens and don't expect TSM's of Battle Hymns or DBD, expect a harder version of A match and some gasoline. Buy it!!"
2,Not so great,After receiving this in the mail I realized I could do this with nothing. Just pretend you are jumping rope. I hae to take the battery out everytime I use it to turn it on again. That means a little screw driver and time.Wasn't worth the money for me.
1,Not worth the money!!,Defiantly not worth the money. I didn't want to listen to any of the negative reviews on them. We have low ceilings so I wanted to test them out myself. But not worth the money!!!
2,They shipped the wrong color,"I can't tell you what I think of the product yet, because I have to return it. I ordered blue, and they sent pink anyway. Don't think my husband would want pink! Fortunately Amazon will pick up the return shipping, but I'm worried about getting the blue one in time for Christmas. Read a review that the same thing happened to someone else. Someone in the shipping department needs to read the labels correctly!"
1,Insufficient as a stand-alone textbook,"This book is ok just for revision purposes, not for a thorough review of the text"
1,DigiPower BP-CN5L,"I ordered the DigiPower battery but was sent the wrong product, a Power2000 battery. Amazon will not stand behind this order and send me the correct battery. Amazon customer service claims the DigiPower is not available but it is still listed in their currect merchandise but with a higher price than when I ordered. Poor customer service."
1,Worthless,"It will hold a charge for a very short period of time, maybe a couple of hours. Don't waste your money. There is no comparison with Canon battery which works well. The Digipower battery is simply awful."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book was the book I should NOT have read when I was dxed. It stated that MS does not produce pain. It frustrated me and I thought great, I have two diseases. Why am I in so much pain?I hope the newer editions have deleted this misleading information."
2,"Factual parts are fine, but attitudes about MS are icky IMHO","There is some good information in this bookdealing with some of the factual bits about MS,but their attitude about MS is really unhealthyin my opinion. The authors have a very""Don't talk about it, don't tell anyone, lie to yourbosses if necessary, ignore it for the most part andmaybe it will go away. That is their practicaladvice."
1,False advertising,"I was atracted to buy this product because of the excellent reviews I read in Amazon. Therefore I bought it from ACE Hardaware Outlet for a total of $77.03. Of course It seemed to be a bargain, but I had confidence because It was checked as a LOW PRICE ITEM. However, I did not receive The Lakewood 5500 made in USA. I received a Lakewood 6500 made in china (similar to those you can find from $40 to $50) which is also different from the one you can see in the picture as a 5500. Fair quality, but not what was expected or advertised. I wrote to acehardwareoutlet and they gave me a number to send it back, but that is not the issue. The big issue is they are offering one thing and shipping a different one. They told me they could not change the product, because they do not sell the 5500 model (so they know they do not sell it, but they advertise their 6500 model in Amazon as if it was the 5500). I just checked the page product , and now they do not offer it any more."
3,How to make Thatcher interesting,"This movie was a gentle- though cynical tale of life in Thatcher's England. A young gay man ends up living with his friend's family, who are upper class and politically conservative. Most of the episodes are spent ambling through some interesting observations of the double life the main character leads- on the one hand being the people pleasing toady of the family and on the other a gay man exploring sex, drugs and the AIDS phenomenon of the 80's.The best scene is where our hero asks Madam Thatcher [referred to as The Lady] to dance at a party and she accepts. From there on it is all down hill. The ending is really sad and gloomy, but if that doesn't bother you, it is worth a look."
1,Totally Debunked,"In the Jan/Feb 2003 issue of Skeptical Inquirer there is an article by Ray Hyman titled ""How Not to Test Mediums"". Mr. Hyman, who is a psychologist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Oregone, totally demolishes Mr. Schwartz's methods and conclusions. The critique is devastating. Mr. Hyman shows how the research by Mr. Schwartz is flawed in many, many ways. Mr. Hyman points out many instances that Mr. Schwartz's 'research' deviated from established procedures and norms. Mr. Schwartz has ignored the accepted scientific methodology."
2,Found it to touchy feely.,"Came into it to optimistic. Was hoping for a Schroeder like, scientific book. Maybe more approachable. Found instead, the type of religious books that I am embarrassed to have in my house. To anecdotal, miraculous, and just Hocus- Pocusy."
3,Brief but informative,"I was hoping for more information on Buchanan's relationship with Rufus King, but only a page or two is devoted to this. The parallels in personality between Buchanan and Bush are apparent."
5,World History and Future: Bucky Fuller,"Fuller speaks as only he can - in ""mental mouthfuls"". This short little paperback covers an enormous amount of ground. He divides all of human existence into twelve periods, all being facilitated by the initiatives of the ""Leonardo types"". He has an inciteful way of connecting things - the aquisition of the 92 elements (the 93rd and beyond he refers to as ""entrances into negative universes"". I have been reading this book for twenty years...still reads fresh...a must for even the most novice Bucky fans."
2,"I bought it before it was reduced., so",now I would likely upgrade to 3 stars since one can't expect much for 1.99. It is a large thin plastic bag and I really doubt it will hold up long term. But it is much thicker than any plastic bag I've found to use as a dust cover for christmas and other seasonal items to store in the attic.
1,Only gave it a 1 because there was no ZERO option.,"Horrible book not suitable for children - unless you are fine with children's book's that end with a tiger eating the child and the father walking away saying ""Whatever"". (Literally this is how the book ends - quite a shock as I was reading it as a bedtime story to my 2 yr old son).The author must be some sick person who never got enough love as a child. The type of person that should NOT be writing children's books.I actually can not believe this thing ever got published."
5,Great Book for Beginner Bird Owners!,"I thought this book was great for all conure owners, or if you are considering a conure. The information given was on the basics like feeding, housing, illnesses; what to watch out for. Foods, do's and don'ts....DON'T feed your conure avocado, it will kill your bird! I wouldn't have known this if I didn't research. I highly recommend this book if you are considering owning any type of conure!GREAT BOOK with GREAT INFO!"
1,Stay away from Vonage,"I have the newest version of the Vonage phone adapter. It was given to me by them for free when I threated to cancel because their Wifi phone had a connection worse than a cell phone. Anyway, the adapter is just as bad. I can hear people fine but people can't hear me, my voice pauses or becomes static. I am cancelling Vonage once and for all. By the way, their customer service is the absolute worst I've ever experienced. The good thing is that it's a very cheap phone service but what's the point if you can't have a conversation with anyone?"
4,Niacin,"My doctor recommended this product to help lower my total cholesterol number. I took 1 capsule and within a few minutes my entire body felt hot and tingly. Very uncomfortable. I now take an aspirin 30 minutes before the niacin. Now, no problems. Be sure to very SLOWLY add niacin to your vitamin regime. It can be powerful stuff."
4,Cheaper Option,This wireless controller is the cheaper option ($19.99 vs. $49.99) and works effectively. I bought it without a manual and realized I had to click the bluetooth button on the piece you plug into PS3 in order for it to be activated. It is a smaller controller for my hands but this is standard size. If you want a cheaper wireless option go for it.
1,Cracked after 5 weeks,"I owned this item and under extremely light use the part that clips to the top of the phone cracked off. The item looks rubberized but it is really hard plastic with a rubberized ""look"" to it. Luckily the reseller gave me my $ back after purchase. Simply put: not a good product."
2,could be much better,"Typically I like this type of clip holster. There is no sloppy fitting leather cover to get in the way of buttons, camera, ect. or plastic covers to trap dirt. However, those plastic/leather covers protect from scratches and probably buffer small drops a little bit.The last Motorola clip holsters I had for a different phone worked great. This one is another story. First, the clip does NOT ratchet like the description says. This makes it very uncomfortable when sitting...the antenna digs right into my side. Also, the clip does not seem to be very secure. My phone has fallen out of the clip immediately after it seemed to snap into the clip. It has also popped out a couple times when I have bumped things.I am actually considering buying one of those plastic/leather covers instead."
2,Guarantee: it will break.,"Broken two so far. Bought a 3rd one because it cost $.01, and less than $5.00 including shipping."
2,A Painful Read!,"I've read Michener before--I loved ""Hawaii,"" for instance, and really got a sense of place for Hawaii after reading that. But this doesn't do Mexico justice. It's mostly about bullfighting. And that would be okay, I guess, if it were an ENGAGING story about bullfighting, but it's not! Getting through it is an exercise in drudgery. Finally I gave up on the bulls and turned to the parts about ancient Mexico, but these, too, didn't do the true story justice. He shows the savagery of human sacrifices but then makes it all politically correct by adding two characters who are AGAINST that sort of thing, and then making them the ancestors of the book's narrator. I love Mexico. I actually like Michener's works. But this was a thoroughly disappointing read."
2,Fictional City and Civilization Drove me Loco,"I had high hopes for this book but I just don't understand why one writes a book about Mexico and then decides to make up huge parts of history. He could have used real history just as effectively in my opinion. Why not talk about Teotihuacan and the pyramids there? Or how about talk about the Toltecs or the Aztecs? As a plot device the fictional city of Toledo and the civilization of Drunken Builders had me in fits. Everytime the story took a turn to the past I was left hollow inside like an empty chimichanga. The dynamic of the bullfighters lives and loves was interesting,that was my favorite part. Only can give 2 stars."
2,disappointing,"This book is mistitled. Rather than being about Mexico, it's about bullfighting. Compared to other Michener books, it only gives you snapshots of a few historical eras, rather than the entire scope of its place's history.Michener is known for weaving fact and fiction, but Michener does a few weird, annoying things here. For instance, the Aztecs are called the ""Altimecs,"" and the PRI is called the ""People's Revolutionary Party."" Since the names ""Aztec"" and ""PRI"" aren't copyrighted, why would he do this?"
4,Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg question answered,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although probably written for a younger audience than I, it was factual and interesting to read. Like many other followers of the civil war, I always wanted to know why Jeb Stuart and his cavalry were not present at the beginning of the battle at Gettysburg. The authors answered that question and provided additional information that two cavalry regiments, commanded by less competent officers, were available to General Lee, had he chosen to use them. He chose not to do so. Had Jeb Stuart been present at Gettysburg prior to the battle commencing, would the result have been different. The authors leave this as an open question, allowing the reader to form his or her own conclusion. I believe that General Lee had tremendeous respect for General Stuart's military acumen and would have acted favorably upon any recommendations provided."
2,ROMAN SANDALS,Not for outdoor use. They provide no protection to the foot. The straps were cheaply attached to the bottom. Low quality.
4,American Quilts: Ellen's Story,"Ellen Tandy lives on a farm with her father and two brothers, ages 16 and 7, and has recently lost her mother. One day, Ellen's father returns from one of his long trips- but he is not alone. He had married a woman named Julia, and brought her son Silas. Ellen doesn't care much for Silas because he is always getting her and her brothers into trouble. Then one day, a play time accident goes horribly wrong. Only then does Ellen realize what Julia and Silas meant to her, and must try to make things right while going on a whirl-wind adventure to teach us all the meaning of family."
3,STEELE on COLD STEEL,"This book reveals few secrets of actual knife fighting techniques with vast majority of the book dedicated to the history, knife types, and application theory, instead of the how-to application. Although this book covers some interesting topics, most is very dated. With the abundance of knife books available today, this book would strictly be a reference to look back on, to study the evolution of knife fighting. One strange, but interesting topic in this book was a section on underwater knife fighting for frogmen, I believe this is the first time this topic was publish in a book of this type. This book is profusely illustrated with diagrams and photographs. Overall an interesting read for the serious blade practitioner."
2,disappointing,"The streets in many areas I have reviewed have not been updated in many years(5 in my hometown), so the 2007 version is no more helpful than my older versions. Save your money if you expected the latest in data!!!"
3,Wasn't Impressed...,"It was off by a lot when I used it, mind you I only used it once to drive to work. I wasn't impressed at all though. I did use the software a lot to navigate for my wife while she was driving, so the software is great, the GPS locator that comes with it isn't worth the extra money. IMO just buy a GPS unit."
2,Biscotti bits and pieces,Each bag of bits and pieces contained a piece or two with errant Cumin seeds with the Anise seeds in the cookies. The taste was horrible !! Every bag had these. I had 6 bags. I know they are slight inperfections but cumin seeds ??
1,Poor Quality,"These peg board pieces are of such poor quality, that the alignment pins don't come close to fitting in the peg board, of course that doesn't matter too much because they quickly break off of the pegs. If the maker was giving them away you couldn't afford them."
2,too small,I purchased these hooks and some others and these were much smaller so they wiggled in the holes so the can fall out. the other ones i bought were larger and more stable. go for the larger ones.
3,Good enough to get you started...,"There's plenty of things in this box to get you started. There was a few things I wish I had more of and a few I wish I had less of. Such as screwdriver holders there was only 1 six driver holder in the box two would have been better. ( With flat heads, phillips, star and allen drivers maybe even four ) The bottom peg on each piece is welded on and some don't align properly with the holes. Out of the 50 pieces I found about 10 like this and had to take a hammer and knock them off or bend them back into shape. All in all good starter kit tho..."
3,bought wrong size,"seems like pretty good quality. unfortunatly, i didn't pay attnetion to the gauge and ordered the smaller size, so they don't fit the peg board I bought."
2,Disappointed,"BUYER BEWARE: Agree with other review...""I purchased this product based on the product description on Amazon. When I received the product I was very disappointed. The wire material used is thinner than I expected about the thickness of a coat hanger."""

4,Sweet,"PROS:- Light and easy to handle.- The cloth on the handle is comfortable.- Great for practice, playing around and whatnot.CONS:- The handguard is NOT attached and is held by a small piece of rubber which does NOT stay on.- Moving it around too much or choking the handle (holding it too high) will cause the handguard to slip off.- It's wood, people, it WILL chip and scratch with use.- The ""blade"" end is kind of broken and chipped.Overall, it's pretty good for the price and is pretty durable.It's not meant for actual swordfighting, people, just to play around and practice.Heads up: gluing the handguard will not work.OVERALL RATING: 5/5"
2,The handle is crap,"While I have no complaints with the hardwood part, the handle is terrible. The hand guard came loose in the box, and would not fit onto the sword when I tried to attach it (the one part made of cheap plastic). Then I tried some simple drills with it. Without any contact whatsoever or advanced moves (entirely basic stuff), the wrapping on the handle began to come loose. By day 3 sections of the wrapping were falling off. Turns out they were just held on with a small bit of glue, and only along the front below where the sharp edge would be. This may be fixed with grip tape or something, but I would recommend you just spend the extra 10 bucks and get a better version that won't fall apart with minimal activity."
3,"Fun toy, okay training device.","My brother and I each received one of these for Christmas. After less than ten minutes of sparring there was already scratches in the paint but nothing too horrible. The hand guard was a little confusing so if anyone is having trouble with that, put the flat piece on, then the rubber. You have to readjust the guard every so often that can be done in a second during a slow moment during a duel.In terms of use, I wouldn't advise buy this if you want to do some hardcore sparring. But the function just fine for a bit of dabbling in kendo. My brother is ten (I'm sixteen) so these work great. They don't hurt too much if you're hit but enough to make you avoid getting hit later so you will improve. The weight is nice and the grip is decent. It's an excellent toy (for kids who know to be careful) and an an okay-training device.I like it very much."
1,where's my handguard?,"So the sword, my second try at ordering a sword that actually comes with a handguard, did not include the alleged attachable handguard. I'm kind of pissed now, Amazon.Get this kind of sword from someone else."
4,Great sword.,The only thing I didn't like about this sword is that the guard isn't held in place very well. Other than that it is great.
5,Splendid Excursion,"With luxuriating readability and marvelous conciseness, Cardinal Dulles offers a splendid excursion through Christian Apologetics. From Paul and Augustine to men and women of the middle twentieth century, the reader becomes familiar with all the high points of religious and philosophic argumentation. For people interested in religious inquiry, this volume becomes the ultimate study guide from which to delve more deeply into the original texts. This is not ""hardpan"" reading, it is as smooth as silk."
5,Courage and Heart,"These are wonderfully crafted stories. R.M. Kinder shows remarkable courage by grabbing and using phrases aptly that few writers realize are even out there. Her characters are three-dimensional, and what they do makes me say to myself, ""I remember that. Yes, I was there."" But I wasn't. The author made me go there in my head. She has good sight, hearing, memory, rhythm, and heart. A beautiful writer in all ways.Do yourself a favor and read this book."
4,Should have a wider appeal,"This is a good book. Berlinerblau has done a convincing job of being fair to all sides, and he does not appear to admire any of the people he writes about. This book says a lot about the way scholars look at one another these days, and the lessons he brings are useful in considering any number of entrenched disputes in the academy today. In the end, the book has a rather depressing message: moral zealots are in charge on both sides of so called 'ideological warfare' today, and neither side is prepared to doubt their right to lie. The book can be dry, but the kind of thing under discussion has no finer demonstration in any work I have read. Luckily, the topic, Bernal's BLACK ATHENA, is a very curious case, especially since Bernal is a white man. Some parts of this are engrossing."
3,Cheap enough,"The nightstands are overall are nice but I'm not a fan of laminated composite wood finishes. One of the front drawers had a small nick on it from shipping, but it's not worth returning it for-- just some black paint will do. It takes awhile to put together but everything lined up and worked out. One annoying thing was their choice of fasteners, in some places they chose screws, others plastic dowels, and others got hidden locking bolts. Unfortunately their seemingly random choices lead to visible screwheads on the sides that you cover with black plastic caps... ugly. For the price though it works."
3,Can you plagiarize yourself?,"Attack on America is essentially a re-arranged version of Beginning of the End. If you haven't read Beginning of the End, then this will be an interesting book. But if you've already read it, you'll probably want to pass on this one."
3,Works good but...,"I purchased this conditioner just when I was done with my Moroccanoil conditioner. I am always a big Moroccanoil hair product user but decided to try something new when I saw the awesome price and great reviews for Terax on Amazon. I have to say it does give your hair a smooth/silky texture but I still have tangle ends when I try to brush through my hair with my fingers. I have really sensitive sense of smell so I am very picky when it comes to choosing hair products since it is so close to my nose. To me, Terax does have a special smell that is close to my puppy's shampoo but it does not bother me at all. Overall, this hair conditioner did not impress me so much that I would recommend people to purchase. If you have colored/damaged/straight/thick hair like me, I highly recommend Moroccanoil conditioner. I think it works a lot better than Terax."
1,Worst conditioner ever,I got this to try out because of the good reviews I saw on here...I have long thick straight hair..I tried putting a little in to begin with..Didn't do the job...Then I put a ton more in...Still didn't do anything for my hair..It doesn't help untangle hair at all..It makes my hair feel like hell..Redken is definitely winning compared to this crap..
2,Buy the other box set!!!,"I agree with A. Andrew ""PartyInMyMouth"", I bought it because I thought the extras would worth it, and I never had a box set from NGEvangelion before, if you are for the episodes themselves, buy the cheaper box set wich comes with the director's cut, and you will save your money from buying something that does not have anything great that won't come in the cheaper box set.Ps: this 2 stars is for the series, the package deserve ZERO."
3,Quick & Easy Medical Terminology,The book and cd's are exactly what I needed. The only thing I was not too happy about is that it's the fact that all the worksheets are completed in writing therefore I am not really able to review and try and answer my own practice questions because the answers were there. It would have been nice if that information would have been disclosed before I purchase the book. The fact that I needed the book asap is what made me keep the book otherwise I would have opted for another book without the writing or even paid for a new one.
5,If you love electronic/industrial... you HAVE TO buy this.,"I happened upon this CD while searching random CDs on here one day, and I bought it pronto after listening to the audio clips. I wasn't disappointed when I got the CD and popped it into my stereo either.Blood Meridian is an album that alternates between hard and soft, and not all of the tracks contain vocals. In fact, the majority of the album is instrumental. That doesn't mean it's any less powerful. On songs like ""Desire,"" the usual scathing scratch of industrial music is present. But on ""Alien Hand,"" an eerie, almost downright spooky, collection of sound effects put to a dark electronic soundtrack makes you feel like you ARE being abducted by aliens!This is a wonderful and original work of electronic art. Be nice to yourself and get this one."
2,Compatibity stops at Windows 95,"I have used ScreenCam 97 which runs fine on Windows 95. Despite the initial banner saying it runs on Windows 95 or 98, note that the spec sheet mentions only Windows 95. When you try it on 98 the software warns you that it won't work. If you try, you record only sound. Playback on 98 is limited to sound and a black panel where the image should be. Tried dinking with video settings to no avail. I agree with another reviewer who said that the product is dying. It's a mystery too, because Lotus ScreenCam was unique among video/audio recorders for packing smooth video motion and good sound quality into a comparatively small file. I'd pay a lot more...for a version that works on 98, ME, 2000 and XP. It would be a golden training tool. What give, Lotus?! Your market awaiteth!"
4,Some will watch it more than once,"I don't know why all the negative reviews for this movie. I watched it a number of times and had fun with it. I enjoyed the characters and the way they were depicted. Rip Off of other films? Hey, in today's (especially horror)movies, what isn't? The idea is to make the next one better than the others or just as darn good. I thought Stay Alive did that.I give it four stars for it's entertainment value, but that's just me."
2,Baaah Humbug,"This movie was horrible. It had good potential to be better than it actually was. I thought that guy from malcolm in the middle ( forgot the actors name ) was annoying as hell. The character fin was just straight disgusting. I watched this movie 2 times just to give it a chance ( some movies you may like it the second time around, works with some people. ) It was a unique idea to put in a movie, but to tell the truth, this movie would be waaay better off if it didn't have to do with video games, and if the writer found some other way to incorporate the ideas excluding the video games, it probably would have been a 4 star."
3,It took me by surprise,"I really didn't expect much from this movie. I wanted to see it badly because I am a gamer myself and just thought it would be a fun concept, but I really thought it was going to be terrible. But I was wrong. The special effects are pretty cool and some of them just plain creepy. Although it's not the scariest movie ever I got a few thrills and even jumped a time or two. I do really wish the film had been rated R. It REALLY had a good chance of being excellent, but after editing the gory scenes the movie lacks. This movie probably isn't for everyone, but if you are a gamer or a fan of video game based movies like Silent Hill and Resident evil, then check this one out."
3,stay awake...,"seriously... i alsmost fall asleep with this one... and im a scary movie fan!it scare me in some parts of the movie, but just beacuse i was watching it in my bedroom, all alone, at night, and the lights off, i mean... i was kinda into the film... lolBUT at half of it it started to get boring... and had some bad acting too...well, if you havent seen it, and you want a movie for halloween... just rent it, i could only see it once..."
2,Great bag--annoying flaw,"I have had this bag for less than two months.. I do not use it every day so it does not get hard use.Start with the flaw-- one of the zipper pulls broke within the first couple of days, and now another one is broken.It is so disappointing to have what is otherwise a great bag show signs of poor materials so soon. Now I wonder how long it will be until all the pulls are broken and the bag is no longer usable.Other than that, I agree with other reviewers that the layout and organization of the bag is great-- and I LOVE the contrasting color inside that makes whatever I put in there easier to see."
5,Nothing but love for Charlie and Lola!,"My kids both love Charlie and Lola! I have only recently discovered them, but found this book just before my daughter started kindergarten. This book looks at some of the things that kids will worry about when they start school (especially for the first time, but also as it turns out for starting a new grade!) and helps ease many of those worries in a way that is gentle and humorous. I love how gentle and easy-going Charlie is with his little sister, and how refreshing it is to see a sister and brother pair who genuinely love each other and even when they're frustrated with each other, they manage to work it out. My daughter and her little brother will have richer lives for this series of books. I can't recommend them highly enough!!!"
2,good try.,"Great cover.I expected this to be good. It feels like a book that needs a lot of editing -- there's nothing wrong w/the concept, the coming of age story, the setting, some details.But, the writing is so uneven. I suspect it was self published. The writer thinks more highly of his talent than the book demonstrates.Self Indulgent.mjh"
3,"Good, but the first TB/BE Album is better...","""Together Again"" is a good, but not great duet album. ""Make Someone Happy"" is the only song that could have made it onto the first TB/BE Album, which IS spectular. If you're on a budget, get the first TB/BE Album or maybe Chet Baker's ""My Funny Valentine"" instead. Still, ""Together Again"" would round out a collection for Bill Evans fans."
1,do not buy this crap,"I've never bothered to fill in one of these before but this propaganda is so bad i had to warn others not to waste their money. This is one of the worst documentaries that i have ever seen. This dude has his head so far up Judaism and fundamentalist christianity that he ends up coming across as a sales rep for one of the mentioned. His views are so one sided and narrow im suprised that he can tie his own shoe laces. waste of money, dont aid more of this crap dont buy it."
3,Poor material - good performance,"Its quite often a bad sign when an artist resorts to naming an album after a former hit, or reprises the track by ""bringing it up to date"". So it is with this album. There's a shortage of material good enough to match the voice, which is in tremendous shape throughout.""Trapped 1990"" is a poor substitute for the original and LaSalles compositions seldom rise above mediocre. George Jackson weighs in with ""Wet Match"" which starts the album.The real stand out track is a reworking of Al Green's ""Love and Happiness"" which really cuts it. Forgettable!"
2,"Durable, but difficult to keep tightened","No problems with the mirror breaking off, but this is still a frustrating product. On my handlebars, the tightening mechanism doesn't get a full grasp. I was able to improve it by using some additional rubber from an old intertube.The mirror doesn't stay in position. Even at maximum tightness, I find that I'm readjusting this thing on every ride. Get the Mirrcyle instead."
3,Glimmerings of future talent,"...in evidence in this book. Otherwise it's so-so. Her later books easily rank among my favorites in this genre, so if this is the only one you've read do try some of her later ones. Lord of Scoundrels and it's sequel and anyone involving the Dreadfuls or the Carsingtons (or both)"
4,"Solid, but not her best.","You can always count on Loretta Chase for a fun, witty, and entertaining book. This was solid, but not memorable. Not a keeper, but I enjoyed reading it."
1,disappointed in canon products,this is the second off camera shoe that we purchased in two years. This one has already quit working and its only August 10th. I hope it still has some warranty.
2,Hardly gives coverage for dark circles,"I have medium skin color with dark circles under my eyes, which I have had all my life. This concealer does not give any coverage whatsoever. I mixed it with the Glo mineral pressed powder and it helped a little. I guess I will stick to using the MAC concealer, which gives the BEST coverage EVER!!!"
4,Great first air rifle,This was my first Pellet Rifle. Don't let the other reviewers fool you this is not the same one from Cummings tools.com. This one is a .22 and the other is a .117. This one has much more power and adequate sights. My uncle has killed 6 rabbits with this rifle.
1,total piece of junk,"i have had this shoddy product for about a year and i have never once gotten a good picture either with a cable connection or an antenna. just static noises and a fuzzy screen. the software is awful, and none of the updates have improved it significantly. i have an ibook running 10.1.5, and the tuner requires an audio in, which ibooks and powerbooks dont have. you can send the sound to speakers, but then the recording option is useless because theres no audio. the housing for the product is also terrible- the ports move around when you try to plug in a cable and you can hear the card moving around. i would not recommend this product at all. the only reason i havent thrown it away is because it was given to me as a gift."
2,Not very good.,"This is not a very good item. First the problem is the range. It might work well out in the country, but my girlfriend and I weren't able to keep signal with each other on the same university campus (and we were only halfway across campus, about a quarter mile away, she was in a building). It also worked less than a quarter mile away from our apartment. Range is disappointing. The second problem is that both of our messengers would at random upon turning on forget our ""buddy list"", making it impossible to send a message to a sleeping unit. Makes the whole thing useless. Overall this product could've been really cool, but it felt like they gave about 63% of possible effort into making it."
2,No Zipper,"Note that this cover does not have a zipper, which makes it near impossible to put on, or remove from the umbrella."
4,good books,good information for student and parent to prepare ahead. a must have for well cared parents and any ambitious student.
4,Lists that help,The lists provide guidance and sequenced steps of what to do at each stage in high school. Really useful to make sure no stone is left unturned and to know in advance to prepare for the actions taken later on. Only drawback is that it's not terribly detailed...but that's not what this book is about. This book is to provide a grocery list so at the end of four years you can kick back and enjoy a gourmet meal.
4,"Good book, very slow...","A human side never seen before is told. It doesn't diminish the atrocities and criminal behavior of this incredible cruel man. Many questions remain unanswered and the book is slow in development and does not explain many things. The author gives his opinion about everything , and that makes it confusing. However I found it interesting, but could only read no more that a chapter a day."
3,A Step in the Wrong Direction.,"Robert Service's book is the newest addition to the recent spate of books on Joseph Stalin. While a meticulously researched effort, it is disturbing that the author is at pains to ""humanize"" Stalin and to understand his behaviour. I quote from a review of the book in The Economist, 6 January 2005:""Here the reader is told that Stalin's crimes, while vast and terrible, were things which a sane, intelligent, sometimes kindly human being might do for understandable if not defensible reasons. It does not feel like a step in the right direction.""I would recommend, Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar by Simon Sebag Montefiore, and as a companion volume, Stalin and His Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him by Donald Rayfield as giving superior treatment to the subject."
2,Not very comfortable,"I was so excited to have a carrier for my 1st child. I had heard such wonderful things about the baby bjorn carriers. I received this one as a gift. I followed the directions to a T and was off and running. My infant was 8 lbs. I managed to wear it for about 30 min the first time and had to take him out. My back was really hurting. I waited a few weeks and tried it again... still got a sore back. I went back to the directions, I re-adjusted the straps and needed tylenol that night. Maybe this just wasn't the right carrier for me. $90 down the drain....."
5,The best bible I've ever seen!,"This bible is absolutely wonderful in every possible way! From the colorful box and outstanding leather binding, to the gorgeous brown-lettered print inside. Each chapter begins with a brief overview of the book itself, and includes timelines, key players, and much more... even the estimated reading time is listed! There are insightful messages (written using real-world examples), plus tons of cool maps, tidbits of information, illustrations, and antidotes throughout the entire book. You can look up scriptures based on issues or problems you may be facing, or choose to follow the included one-year reading plan. There are a lot more features included, but way to many to mention here. Just take my advice, this is by far the best bible I've ever seen... As easy to read as 'The Message', yet more true to the scriptures we've grown used to. A solid 5-Stars! Thank you, Tyndale. Please don't drop this one."
1,it's pretty but it doesn't work,"if you find a free frequency it work well, if do not you spend a lot time to find it."
1,Terrible Sound,"I gave this as a Christmas gift. I was asked to see if there was something wrong with it because the sound was awful. Every channel on the FM dial produced nothing but static. Occasionally we could hear the music but within a couple of minutes the static would return. Spent over an hour trying to find a station that would work. Would not buy again, and will be returning it.I own a Griffin 9501-TRIPCB iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod and it works great. I will be buying this to replace my gift for friend."
2,Hard reading - poorly written,"I have to compare this book, ""Iron Tears,"" to Don Cook's book ""The Long Fuse: How England Lost the American Colonies 1760-1785"". ""The Long Fuse"" is a tightly written book that reads almost like a novel - even though I knew the ending, I could hardly put the book down. I read late into the night to finish it.Weintraub's book, ""Iron Tears"" is a hard read. It's full of extraneous information that really has no real relevance to the story. He does a poor job of describing the major players on the English side and their impact on the decisions regarding the war.The only way I could recommend Weintraub's book is if you have a particular interest in the extraneous data in his book and a high tolerance for poor writing. But if you're interested in a book that draws you in - a book you can't put down - and yet a book that tells the story, get ""The Long Fuse""."
3,Just the facts,A factual look at the Revolutionary war with some of the events which occured in England getting some attention. A somewhat dry read. I am still looking for a book covering this war strictly from the British side.
4,give it time,"I've been using this for over a year. I have 2 cats, 8+ years old, m & f. I read the negative reviews first, and it seems these reviewers expect instant results. At first, I expected quick results, but found if I waited longer, say 2 to 3 weeks, the stain disappeared. Remember, it is based on urp/fecal/urine munching bacteria, so it can take some time. A friend that has cats uses Resolve or Woolite (the Oxy-Clean ones) and wants results quickly, but I've noticed that K&P does a better job over time - and without the potentially dangerous chemicals."
2,Not as pictured and not as good as I'd hoped,"The pictured product is ROUND. What I was sent is rectangular, like those in other similar items for sale. I think this is part of the ""not as good as hoped"" problem: when the press is engaged, there is plenty of pressure in the central area right under where the screw is, but out at the periphery of the rectangle, the plastic isn't thick/strong enough to apply adequate pressure to the cabbage; the plastic bows upwards. I bet a round one would work better.My other complaint is that the size description is very misleading. If you fill the container halfway with cabbage, it just barely closes with a lot of work. Then it screws it down to press it further."
3,Not one of her best,"For The Grey Beginning, Barbara Michaels departs from her usual setting. Her forte is the cozy Gothic set in or around Washington, D.C. and those are incomparable and wonderful.TGB is set in a Tuscan Villa. Stock sinister characters such as the loutish henchman, the Mrs. Danverish housekeeper and the young, vulnerable heroine are present, though with the Michaels spin. The heroine has plenty of romantic interests to choose from, and though her encounters with the PhD candidate in the attic, and the attrative psychiatrist are enjoyable reading, the storylines never tie up. The book just ends, after a terrifying though unlikely confrontation.Still, Barbara Michaels at her worst is better than the average, so if you're a fan, go ahead and read this one. Just don't expect Ammie, Come Home, or Shattered Silk."
3,Show me the money.,"Heavy on the anecdotal but not on the philosophical, that is, where are we heading with the gross concentration of wealth in a few hands?"
1,Disaster,"First, I find it funny how this pan is advertised as ""nonstick"". If there's anything that the food sticks to, it's this ""pan"". After only 2 weeks of using it, it looks way worse than Tefal pan I used for over 2 years. If anything this ""pan"" can serve as a nice demo for introductory physics course on the strength of electromagnetic force of ""sticking"". Moreover, on the bottom of the pan it says ""easy clean nonstick"". Again, false advertising at it's finest. The only time someone would have to be forced to clean it is as some form of ultimate punishment for heavy crimes.... like genocide. Second, it's pain to get any food off it once it sticks - because when it sticks - oh then it REALLY sticks. To top it of, even the bottom of the ""pan"" after two weeks looks like it has been throughout the nuclear apocalypse."
2,fabulous to have the text; horrible not to have the music examples,"The book deserves 5 stars; this edition barely earns 1. I took a 1960s reprint of the book out of the library so many times (working as a music director for a touring summer Shakespeare company) that I decided it was high time to buy my own copy. It's true that the product description says ""may not include graphics or images from the original edition,"" but I managed to miss that in my delight at finding it available from Amazon. Easy to see why I missed it: the title is, after all, ""Shakespeare and Music: With Illustrations from the Music of the 16th and 17th Centuries."" The text alone is not worthless, but the book's value is significantly reduced without the images. My recommendation: use your local library or buy a used copy of an intact edition that includes the music examples."
2,Helpful combo,The cd was only helpful in that it it made me aware that it was futile to try to learn the language. How sounds are made by the vocal chords and tongue in Arabic is totally different than English. But the phrase book that comes with the CD was helpful.
3,Good for the money,Good but not a lot of grip so better not if on serious MTBiking. Bearings are tight so you can either rebuilt or let some good lubricant percolate overnight. Good looking and really light. Same product costs $2 more than on amazon including shipping...can't beat front door delivery!
2,WATCH OUT Circular Saw didn't work,So much for the birthday gift to hubby. He waited a couple of weeks to put the tools to work and the circular didn't work on the job. So now it is all just a hazzle.
4,two sweet stories,"Holding Out for Hero: Through Texan Men magazine, wealthy entrepreneur Tanner Jones found the prefect Texas woman-beautiful Dori Mae Fitzpatrick. But because he wanted to be loved for himself, not his money, Tanner neglected to mention the fact that he was filthy rich. Little did he guess that Dori was keeping a few secrets of her own...Mail-Order Bridegroom Faced with bankruptcy, Leah Hampton needed a husband-fast. But despite her advertisement, her only candidate was Hunter Pryde. Their marriage would be a business arrangement-nothing more. Not that Hunter would want anything else-he'd made that clear eight years ago. And Leah was too smart to fall for the same trick twice, wasn't she?"
2,Way overpriced...,"..for a flashlight with a plastic body.Pros:-Rubber grip makes assists holding-Lens ""collar"" has a horizontal ""stand"" that prevents rolling.-Decent light output in center of beam.Cons:-Plastic body; this is unlikely to stand up to use in harsh conditions (or being dropped to hard surface even in benign conditions).-Far overpriced; take a pass unless you see it for under $10."
4,"The last book finished strong, and I wish there were more.","I loved this book!! The only thing I didn't like was the new character, Allegra. I can't believe she tried to break up chelsea and Connor, when chelsea was planning an unforgettable night with Connor. Other than that it was great!"
2,Boring and tedious,"The graphics are very good and the game is fun to play for a couple of matches, but after that it gets really boring. It's just the same old button mashing every round, and not that that's necessarily a bad thing but with this game it gets so dull. Also, the game designers tried too hard to make the characters very ""wacky"" and the result is that most of the characters and humor in this game is just plain stupid (but not even in a funny way). In closing, I'll say this game is overrated, and I don't understand how people can find it so fun. It's worth a rental, but little else. I played my copy only twice before reselling it."
3,"Disappointing, Especially for Johnny Vicious. Also = Dance","I always look forward to any Johnny Viscious release, but this CD set was a big dissapointment. I purchase CD's and then rip them lossless to J River's Media Center. After listening to both CD's a couple of times, I'm having a hard time wanting to rip a single track... I'm going to try and listen to this several more times and see if any of the songs grow on me. These are definitely Dance tracks, and is simply another Ultra Dance CD... No trance here in my opinion. I love dance music, but these songs are boring: neither satisfying dance or the trance genre... skip it in my opinion."
3,Overall an OKAY cd...,"i agree with a lot of ppl that this is more DANCe than trance but i liked a lot of the songs on this CD such as, Motercyle- As the rush comes, iio-smooth, Close to the Edge,and Burned with Desire...but it would've been better if they got rid of songs such as milkshake, u promised me, etc. The milkshake song especially!its REALLY annoying. Basically, in my opinion, some of the songs are REALLY good and some are REALLY bad."
1,Waste of Paper!,"How many trees had to die so this literary masterpiece could be published. Random thoughts? Such a ""novel"" idea. Though the concept is interesting, I feel that one must have a grasp of proper grammatical form and storytelling before embarking on such a venture. Intersting idea, poor content."
5,disappointed,"I had bought the set about 3 years ago for my daughter as a birthday present and was very disappointed because it would not play in her dvd player or on her brand new computer. Didn't realize until this happened that I got conned. Called the company and did eventually received my money back. Won't do that again. Will wait for the ""real deal"" as someone mentioned before. My daughter and I love the show and would enjoy having all the shows on dvd. Can't wait for it to come out."
2,Another lackluster Simpsons game for Game Boy,"I wanted this game to be good, but it just isn't. I love the Simpsons which is probably the reason I keep buying the games they put out for Game Boy but The levels for this game are just too simplistic and uninspired. Also in order to prevent playing the early levels each time you turn on the game you need to input an 11 letter code which is a annoying. I will probably play with it for about another day or two, then put it away to be forgotten. The two stars are mostly just for the Simpsons name. I would have given it more, but not after paying ..."
5,The Best Gameboy Color Game,"AT frist this game was easy, so I thought this was going to be a boring. Then it got harder, so each day I wanted to pass the levels. So this is a good game for people who want a challange."
2,Not my kind of romance,"This book was recommended on a romance book list. It sounded good so I ordered it. Wasted my money, because I truly hated this book. First she's raped, but she loves and forgives him, then he hits her, but she loves and forgives him, then he beats her, and you guessed it, she loves and forgives him. I realize its in historical times, and women in general were chattel, but this was not the type of book I wanted to read!"
5,AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is AWESOME.Its a lot more fun compared to other Cruis'n games.This game features many courses,lots of cars to chose from,up to 4 players,and 3 game modes to play.Its fun for a while by your self but then it gets boring,but its always fun with other people playing with you.When I oredered it I couldn't wait until it was at my house and I could play it.This game has very creative cars to drive, like a forklift,a car that is all junky yet it still works,a solor powered car,a car that looks like a limo,and there is many more cars to race.I like that it keeps track of how many miles you drive.The more miles you drive the more cars you earn.Great game to get!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Perky and pleasant,"A good workout, and a pleasant instructor. It's easy, though---perhaps too easy?---and after a couple of months of doing this workout at least once or twice a week, I'm finding there to be too much time between each exercise as she explains each one.That said, it was a great introduction to working with the gym ball, and I really like catching her little imperfections. Definitely a thumbs-up if you're in the market for a beginning gym ball workout."
3,Curious...,"The author begins the book with an anecdote about a cab ride wherein he assumes that the white cab driver is assuming that Takaki is not American because of his race. The author was born in the US. Curious that what drew me to this book was an interview with Takaki on National Public Radio's ""Tavis Smiley Show"". Obviously, being a radio broadcast, I could not see Takaki. Before ever setting eyes on the book, I assumed, from the Takaki's accent and speech pattern, that he was not American. Perhaps Takaki could not see what was in the cab driver's mirror because he can only look in his own, which is essentially the problem with all these multicultural reflections on American society. That being said, this is one more voice that attempts to articulate things that the language seems not really designed to talk about and is not an absolute failure."
2,I did not like this book.,"This book offers an average-at-best history of American culture. Although some of the heart of the book was interesting, most gave me a flashback to high school history class. There was very little new material. Also, the last chapter in the book was incredibly biased. Although I understand that historians are allowed to be biased, he places entirely too much blame on Ronald Reagan for part of the racial tension in America today. He almost glorifies the Rodney King riot for showing us how much racial tension there really was, and virtually claims Rodney King as some kind of hero. This riot was nothing short of immature. Overall I give the book a 3/10 because it did offer some interesting facts about the early history of diversity in America, but eventually I believe he wandered from his point in the last chapters by pointing fingers."
5,Wonderful book,"This book should be required reading for high school, and college students. Unfortunately, I didn't read this book until I was in my 40's and I'm angry that I didn't read it when I was younger. Such a wonderful look at history from the side of minorities and women. Obviously not told by the white men that ""wrote history"". Can't say enough great things about this eye opening book."
5,excellent,"I bought this book for a class i took. I enjoyed this book. It gives a good review of several different discriminations among various peoples (Japanese, blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, etc). Good book to have!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM!,They would never reply to my emails for a refund. The holster is very flimsy. You must also RIP your pistol out of the holster therefore scratching your firearm. I would recommend NOT BUYING THIS HOLSTER! I now have switched to a blackhawk serpa and absolutely love it.
2,This book was ok,"This was an ok book, but not a lot of combat or descriptions of what was happening. I would not recommend it."
4,Daniel @ Ashley River El.,"I like the book Danger the Dog Yard Cat. I recommend this book to you because it tells you about a cat that raced in the Iditarod. The pictures are funny. This book is half true and half make believe. This book is about a cat that gets saved by a dog sled racer that has a lot of dogs. The Cat has to race for the dog leader because he hurt his paw. Danger had one friend that was a dog, and his name was Mud shark."
5,Travis at Ashley River El.,I recommend Danger The Dog Yard Cat because it is a very funny story. My favorite part of this story is when you find out that Danger was just dreaming that she had won the Iditarod. I also liked the pictures in the book. This story made me wonder what it is like in Alaska.
3,Good Summer Read,"My bookclub read this novel and were somewhat disappointed. The book was described by the publisher as being ""often hilarious"". Some of Ad Hudler's work may be hilarious but this book was not. However, the story and the characters were believable and memorable and the plot did hold our attention. Our group gave it good marks for being historically correct and bad marks for its abrupt ending. ""All This Belongs to Me"" was not one of our favorites but we agreed that it would make a good summer read."
5,Another excellent Voyager book by Christie Golden,"Having loved ""The Murdered Sun"" I decided I had to buy ""Marooned"". While ""Marooned"" was not quite as good as Ms. Golden's previous Voyager book it was still excellent. ""Marooned"" reminded me of why I love Kes. Kes appears delicate, but she is a very strong and stubborn character. The Paris/Torres interaction was well done and fit the interaction we saw between the characters on the show."
3,"Better than the rest, but...","I've found most of the Voyager books to be rather wanting in style, action, or characterization. Christie Golden incorporates all of this into the book, but I still felt like I had room for dessert. Plus points: she gives Kes her strongest role since ""Warlord"" and plays off the other characters' interactions rather well. This novel gives me hope for other Voyager novels, and makes me want to read Ms. Golden's new book ""Seven of Nine."""
2,A bad show,The sound quality is poor. The whole show doesn't feel like a real live event. I saw Elton John twice live in NYC - but this show is far away from the reality. Don't buy it.
4,One of the better ones out there BUT....,"A packed Madison Square Gardens, lots of great camera angles and Elton covers all his greatest hits. His voice is still pretty good too, although he's now ducking and covering from most of those high notes. It's a pretty good DVD and sounds fairly good on DTS so it's worth having BUT:1. Elton looks really plump and the camera angle on his face and hands is incredibly unflattering a lot of the time2. His band is very unsexy. That may not mean much to some people but I find that it dilutes the excitement and energy of the overall show3. His guests are all terrible and superfluous except for Billy Joel.4. The footage looks awful. It seems to have been shot on film (as opposed to video) which looks grainy and horribly transferred."
4,Works both ways,This is the first book that I read on NFP and it served to be the most informative and useful. Before reading the book I had only heard of the famous rhythm method. This book opened a door to many different signs that a women can use to tell when she is fertile. I have used these signs (along with prayer) to GET pregnant (so I don't understand the other reveiwer).I would happily recommend this book to anyone wanting to conceive as well as those that want a safe way to prevent conception.
3,Good consumer lightbox,Good:Is bright enough to shine through Bristol and one or two pages of guidelinesIs sturdy enough to put up with reasonable wear and tearIs light and small enough to be used as part of a portable project kit.Bad:Case has a built in tilt that forces you to use it landscape or awkwardly prop the short end up to enable portrait orientationCase is made out of a brittle plastic that raises concerns for transport - do not drop or squish it!
4,"Light Tracer Light Box 10""x12""",The light is good enough to trace but is not a strong light.The on and off button needs a little functioning.Other than that I'm happy with the purchase since I got what I'd payed for. thanks
4,it's ok but sizing not right,"The Fox sizing chart says I should be an XL. However the fingers were so tight and so short I couldn't wear it, so returned it.I then got a 2XL, and the fingers are still a little tight and the thumb is still too short. I can't go up another size as the fingers would then be too long, and the slight bunching up when gripping my motorcycle grips might become a problem . . .I've only used it for about ~30 miles of riding as winter came up and had to swap to winter gloves. Worked fine in 60F-70F weather. It appears to be quality made and breathable. I wouldn't mind more hard protection for the lower parts of the fingers and upper hand area."
1,book review,i did not receive the book ordered. It was only a woman called fancy. It did not contain the Goldern Hawk
5,Sweet Harmony,"There are many talented groups with a great sound, but there is something very special about the Manhattans. From the very first time I heard them, I fell in love with their smooth soulful sound that makes one think of love and romance. I sense that Boys To Men listened to them a lot and was inspired by them, when I listen to Boys To Men I can hear that same smooth soulful romantic harmony, their styles are very close. They truly are one of the great groups of their era."
5,Pure Magic,"Finally, a software product that does exactly what it claims to do...and it does it perfectly. I dreaded partioning the 27 Gig hard drive on my new Dell. If I'd only known how easy Partition Magic would make it, I never would've sweated it out. Perfect!"
2,NOT FOR NT!,"I purchased this product to merge partitions on some Win 95 and 98 boxes in my office. For that purpose, this software worked wonderfully. Not one problem came up. If you intend to use this product on those platforms, you should be happy. It did wonderful work on those machines.I got too confident in it and tried to resize two partitions on a Windows NT machine, with the ultimate result being a system corruption from which we were unable to recover. I succeeded in resizing my partitions only after I was forced to REINSTALL THE ENTIRE WINDOWS NT OPERATING SYSTEM. UGH. Maybe I did something I wasn't supposed to do, who knows? But this software should be good enough to recognize when the user is doing something stupid and not let you. At the very least, it should give lots of warnings. No such luck... My advice is stay away from this product for NT unless you are an MCSE or experienced enough."
2,The story is good but DON'T GET IT for your Kindle,"I purchased this both the hard back, and the kindle versions. The kindle version you couldn't even read the words on the pages, you couldn't see the pictures it was dark and poorly converted for treading. VERY sad I was going to use it for a project for student teaching but now I am going to do something else...."
4,I'm glad i bought it,"It took me til the 4th one to finally break down and by a pure moods cd but i'm glad i did. there are only 1 or 2 songs that i'm not thrilled with but sometimes i'm even in a mood to hear them. i'm more inclined to buy others from the series now. My favorite songs are ""november"" and ""shadows in silence"""
2,Do not buy for skis,The bars are much too far apart for skis to be secure. It would probably work for a snowboard. I used the Rubbermaid Utility Hooks instead and they work much better for skis.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,"This movie is AWFUL! It doesn't deserve me spending much time on this. I like Mandy Moore a lot, and I am a huge Hugh Grant fan. However, the movie is very cheesy, and superficial. It's obviously a spoof of American Idol and how more people pay attention to that than politics, but it ends up being so pointless (horrbile ending) that you sorta loose the point in the whole ridiculousness of it all. This is Hugh Grant at his worst, not funny, and trying to be a ""Simon Cowell"" type. It was way OVERDONE. Yuck!"
3,It was pretty funny,"It could have been a lot better. There were some good laughs but it felt very rushed. The contestants go from singing their first song on television to being in the final three in less than three minutes. And the ending was pretty tacked on like film makers just got bored with the project. Still, worth a rental."
5,Hilarious!,"This movie is hilarious! Yes, it's satirical and even cynical at some points but the main thing is that it kept me laughing throughout the entire thing. When is the DVD coming out?"
1,I need to hear A Hunter not the band to evaluate for purchac,More vocals needed to reveiw adequately
4,Disappointing deserts - good otherwise,"This a very good book that fills a huge void in the cookbood section. The deserts, however, were disappointing in that Fran uses Splenda in most of them. Being someone who is very mistrustful of man-made additives (aspartame anyone?) I can only wonder what the long term effects are going to be for people injesting sugar which has had chlorine atoms injected into it. The book would have been better with natural ingredients like Stevia."
4,The Low Carb Cookbook,The Low Carb Cookbook had lots of helpful recipes for what I was looking forVery satisfied.
3,Too Fancy,"This book has some good receipes, but if you want an easy simple low carb cookbook, keep looking. I found it difficult to find a meal that I could just ""whip up"" after a long day working. Call me plain and boring, but I want receipes that are simple to make and require items that I can buy at the grocery store or I already use. This cookbook is for someone who has the time and desire to make fancy dishes."
4,I found the book informative and easy to read.,"AS a newcomer to the world of low-carb eating, I found that this book was packed full of nutritional information that I needed in order to begin a new way of eating. The recipes are straight forward and easy to follow. I have tried many of them and found that not only do they fit my eating lifestyle, but also the rest of my family who normally groan at my weight losing plans. It is a great primer for the novice and a good reference book for the long-time low carb diet."
4,"Jenya Lano is the eye ""CANDY"" here!","Low-budget doesn't always mean bad, and this 2002 direct-to-video effort is better than you might expect. While it has some nudity, it also has a decent plot and competent acting, so it rises above being simply a sexplotation film. In fact, the nudity and sex are minimal and tasteful, and simply required by the plot.Three ex-cons devise the ultimate safe score; kidnap a popular actress and make millions by forcing her to have live sex on the Internet. Things don't go as planned, of course, and some neat plot twists lead to an interesting ending. Decent enough to be worth a watch."
2,She's Hot. Film's Not.,"STEALING CANDY is high concept, low-quality junk. It's from the director of COMMANDO (mid-80's hit with Schwartzeneger), which was also junk, and seeing how far Mark Lester has fallen is no surprise.The plot I'm sure looked great on B-movie paper, and the promise of getting the attractive Jenya Lano to shed her clothes and go at it on camera probably is what has propelled this to direct-to-dvd hit. And you do get to see Ms. Lano in all her gorgeous glory. If that's what you're after, purchase away.But the rest of the movie is basically a limp life-support system for this one commercial element. Stupid twists and terrible scene-chewing abound. To be clear, it's not horridly unprofessional in it's execution. This is a compotently made film, technically. But creatively, it's sad. Best to rent this and just fast-forward to the boobies, if that's indeed what one is after."
2,DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS GAME'S BOX,"This is definitely a kiddy game in disguise. It's an average kiddy game also. When you shoot your weapon, you get a little ""boop"" noise, and there's no battery save so you're gonna need a pen and paper for the password. The graphics aren't so hot, especially on Game Boy Advance which makes the game impossible to see in dark light. Your character is a little guy from the top down perspective shooting his little ""boop"" guns, but they make cooler noises as you get better ones. This game isn't very fun."
4,HAIR STRAIGHTENING PRODUCT,"I do like this product. It most definitely helps with the frizz, especially since I live in the deep south where humidity is a huge factor."
2,I am now Water Wiser!!!,"I only give this unit 2 stars because we did get distilled water from it. Early on, we would have water all over the counter. Sometimes there was as much water on the counter as in the catch pitcher. We talked to Waterwise on several occasions and they were absolutely no help. They made several suggestions, but none worked. Do yourself a favor and get a better distiller."
4,A convincing case for the necessity of Sacred Tradition,"With wit and insight, Mark Shea probes the question, ""Is Sacred Tradition a necessary part of the Christian tradition?"" and shows with numerous examples that the answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" Especially helpful are the examples: Shea shows that, in one instance, such a given Protestant doctrine like the reality of the Blessed Trinity is a conclusion drawn from scriptural evidence AND the Apostolic Tradition of the Catholic Church. If I have any quibble with the book, it would be that it is not exhaustive enough. It doesn't address the full range of the case for ""sola scriptura"" (only Scripture), but then Shea never said he was attempting to write a book that would be the be-all and end-all resolution to a question that has been plaguing Christians for four hundred years!"
1,overdone,"the cinema tried too hard to be ""spooky"" and simply came off as tacky. all and all i would have given it no stars except you are required to give it at least one."
2,the book liberals don't want you to see?,"1st Prize for Outstanding Crassness at a Time of Great National Stress goes to Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Forum, who, on Day 4 of the hurricane disaster, sent an 'Urgent Message"" to her subscribers on behalf of none other than Mrs. Dorothy Helms.What was the urgency? Just this: we must urgently run out and buy Mr. Helms' *Here's Where I Stand* before the liberals ""torpedo"" the thing and ruin Jesse's day. According to Mrs. Helms, liberals are ""all set"" to do just that.Funny, Booklist and Kirkus are pretty blase about it.Likewise most reader reviews here.The fact is, the book isn't the least bit scandalous. If that's what you're hoping for, you're out of luck. Send your money to the Red Cross instead."
4,Great!,"I have no prior piano/keyboard experience. I got this and was enjoying every minute. I studied for about two or so months, then I had to stop a year ago, because I was too busy.But, I'm starting again, and I'll be sticking with this book and DVD. Get the book, too, it's really worth it. The lessons are simple, and the book is well written. It teaches you proper technique, how to read notes, and how to play simple songs. I don't think it teaches chords--I'm not sure. But I'm not ready for chords, anyway.If you have no idea how to play, and want to learn, then this is for you."
3,"very good, but not among my real favorites","I have enjoyed this cd and will play it fairly often. She is good, but a step below Linda Eder Nancy LaMott and half a step behind Suzanna McCorkle and others. Sorry."
5,Romantic and erotic,"Nymph is elegant, beautiful and romantically erotic. I Loved it! It is painted with a magic brush and its as though her characters are supernatural, they come to life. I highly recommend it!"
2,Has wings...still falls flat,"I am enchanted by the writing style of Ms Block, but I found the stories in this book to be a little heavy-handed. I don't know how the book could be improved. Her word choices seemed a bit jagged and didn't really mesh well with her beautiful writing, leaving the stories disjointed."
1,Very Dissapointed.....,"I am a HUGE FLB fan, and now I am very dissapointed... I have read every single book of hers, and this one HAS to be the worst of hers. It lacks any type of story-telling. It consists of nine eroctic short stories, I enjoyed none. . I see that this book is placed in the young adult section in many libraries, and i am dissapointed b/c this is oviously a steamy steamy book. Although, ALL her other books are great!"
2,I don't think so,"If you think every man thinks the same way, does the same thing, has the same desires, and is just lumped into one cateogry, then this book will show you that. Peresonally, I like women that are real, without all of the games that we men see through anyway.Yeah, men are visual. So are women! Men like intimacy just as much as women do. The title says more than the book does."
3,Make Your Own Judgement,"If you want to know about men, go make some male friends!If you want to know some theories to deal with men, this book can only be your first refernce. It can give you some ideas, but not the whole picture. Besides, the time is changing, so are people. Take my advice, when you have a question about men, ask one of male friends and make your own judgement."
3,"meh, it was okay","some/most of this was common sense if you think about it, so it wasn't too helpful for me."
2,Awkward,"You can hang your golf bag from this gadget, but it dangles diagnally, so you better be sure there's room on either side. The shoe hooks seem worthless to me."
4,Good Bag but...,"It's a good bag, but it is showing some tears and scratches. It holds my laptop, charger, and several file folders to go to and from school"
2,Man is meat...,"Simple...If you're an inexperienced new love of Ministry, buy it...If you're an old fan, you already have all these tracks, so don't bother..."
1,Sounds like a pig getting slaughtered,"Ministry is not a 'band'. It's 2 guys with a synthesizer and a drum machine who couldn't sing their way out of a wet paper bag.I normally don't review things that I'm not a fan of, but these guys are so BAD, that I didn't want an innocent reader to get the idea that this CD may actually contain something worthwile."
2,disappointed,I am disappointed in the quality of the Ekco Everyday Radiance stockpot that I purchased. I almost immediately had trouble with food sticking to the bottom. The non-stick coating is very thin and is already wearing off of the bottom. I will not buy Ekco brand cookware again.
3,Has its uses,"These pots are rather tinny in construction, but they have their uses. We cook rice, pasta and several other simple recipes. Just be careful and avoid setting them on high heat. For the price, they are worth it."
3,G Shock Review,Received a G Shock for Christmas. Has a lot of nice features. You will probably have to shorten the wrist band unless you are one big dude. I received instructions from Casio as they are not in the directions. You need a small slotted screw driver and a ton of patience but it can be done.
3,Excellent product marred by a couple of design goofs,"Accuracy is typical Casio--excellent. I find the appearance quite nice, but that's subjective, of course. To my eye, the black metal band is quite sturdy, and the paint has held up very well so far. I wear it daily, and in fact only took it off long enough to put on sunscreen one time. I resized it very easily using an optical screwdriver--dunno why so many others are chafing at this procedure. I only have 3 complaints: A) The ""time recorder"" feature is of absolutely no use or value. Casio would do well to return the countdown timer that function replaces. B)The three cool looking small dials are legible, but the markings that label the LCD data they present are all but invisible, at least to my 44year old eyes. C) The alarms should be louder and of longer duration. If Casio fixed those things, this would absolutely be the last watch I'd ever need."
5,great watch except the alarm.,"the watch is great, tough looking, but the alarm is only 9 seconds, however, you can setup 4 alarm time one minute after another. that surely wakes up anyone."
1,Used Watch for new price,"Watch was beat up, impossible to adjust the wristband, and even harder to arrange a return. Never again."
3,"Interesting, but...","This book gets three stars because the techniques are accurate and highly illustrated, but the book also has a number of frustrating aspects, which I'll talk about shortly. It has an old style charm, as it was written in a time when martial arts books were not well edited. There are numerous cases of broken English in the intros. It was never re-edited in later editions. In a way this adds to the allure of the book, but its also distracting. Thankfully, most of the book is pictures. :)I get the feeling this book would be much better if they took all the photos and made a flip book. Seriously. It can be very difficult to follow the forms here, based on these static images, no matter how many there are. They need to be seen in motion. I'd rather see this on DVD, than in a book. As a book, its lacking, despite it's authenticity. A book is a training tool, and it gets three stars because it falls short of the many solid, modern texts on martial arts that exist today."
5,Fantastic read.,This is a must read! It is a quick and fast paced read. I could not put it down I read it all in one sitting.
2,short use of good talent,"i really must say that it was ok could've been better, alot better! if they only would've taken more time & care on the script. the casting was superb that's why it's a shame it falls soo short of greatest , a great idea just poorly excuted. jeff daniels & catherine o'hara are pefect in their roles but the script leaves little for them to do,the beginning is great but runs out of steam.there are some funny moments that's about it. it's PG-13 for profanity."
1,disappointed in lexmark p450,I was very disappointed in the Lexmark P450 printer. The colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the Lexmark standards that I am used to. (I have several Lexmark products) I returned the printer.
1,Talk about butchering a classic,"For those who don't know, Patti Labelle and her group did this song back in the '70s, but this version of the song is an injustice. Christina and Pink can sing, but they sound awful here. Lil' Kim's rap is unnecessary and as usual, you can hardly hear Mya. I will even go as far as to say that All Saints did a better cover of this song on the Dr. Doolittle soundtrack. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
2,"Good, But Got Old Too Fast","Not only that but the fact that I have to turn down the radio whenever Christina's part comes on is really annoying! Why her? Pick someone a bit softer!! But as for the other girls, they're great! I loved this song at one point but it got old REALLY fast...they played it on the radio too much."
2,Not Marmalade!,"Sometimes, when reworked versions, and covers seem to come along in music, they really always don't seem to fit the bill very well. For Lady Marmalade by LaBelle, it was and still is absolutely divine and soulful. Unfortunately, the version from Moulin' Rouge with Nicole Kidman, isn't one to live up to expectations. The collaboration of Pink, Lil' Kim, Christina Aguillera, and Mya, sounds more like a divafest of knowing who is the better diva. The song also adds a rap that Lil' Kim conjured that really wasn't part of the version LaBelle made that didn't even add spice to it. Instead, it just sinks the track to even lower heights. All in all, I really didn't find this version exciting and worth listening to, time after time. It really doesn't have the longevity of the original one from the 70's, and it never will."
1,"Is a great song, except for Christina aka (SCREAM MACHINE)","Yeah man, the missed it up after they decide to add her, man she just screams sooooooooo much, is dosen't even sound good.The song is great, PINK , MYA , LIL KIM ,But when SCREAM MACHINE takes off I have to put the volume down , Mannnn , it wakes up my whole neighborhood.Anyways, if you want to bye it, I recommend for you to do so, at least do it for all of the other artists that contributed to it."
4,Works Well!,"Just received the topper and had it put together and on the 10 gallon tank within 10 minutes.Really simple instructions to follow. The product seems sturdy and fit the tank perfectly.A couple suggestions for the manufacturer though. First is to make the 12"" ramp a 13 or even 13.5"" ramp. Its abit steep at 12"". Its ok for my rat but if you have a smaller critter it may be to steep for them to get up.Also, the food cup at the top? My rat is tossing all the food out and it goes all over the place. Then she takes the bowl out of hte hole and trys to drop down thru the hole, and its a far drop! I am going to seal off the hole and not use the dish.Other than that.. All seems fine. This was a really cheap and easy way to double my rats home size."
3,"Good, but could be better.","It can be obnoxious trying to get into the bottom of the tank from the top opening. I wish it had a side door. That said, my hamster did seem to enjoy this. it was safer for her as well, seeing as she was very large and was having issues getting through the tubes on those obnoxious Crittertrail cages."
1,Last cage your hamster will see,"I've been through two hamsters in about 3 months. One's death that I am 100% sure is do to this cage. Both hamsters seemed to like to dive from the top shelves into the bottom of the cage, or would slip while attempting the monkey bar position across the top. (Shortly after I discovered that hampsters are prone to blood clots from falls) I do not suggest this item for anyone with small hamsters, or over active hamsters that like to be a little too adventure driven. Since the death of the second hamster, I have replaced the cage and am having no problems with hamster number 3."
3,Adds alot of space.,"My hampster loves his new cage, but has trouble climbing up the ramp to the first platform. She has fallen off multiple times and she evenchually learned that she has to go super slow. Her new favorite thing to do is climb on top of the water botter and grap on the the cage part with the bars and climb it like a latter to get to the top platform so she doesn't have to go up the ramp. If it weren'y for the first ramp being so steep and hard for my hampster to climb up, I would love it!"
1,I'm sorry I bought this CD,"So my Girlfriend and I are walking around our local record store and we see the new Phantom Planet CD. We were psyched. My girlfriend has there Guest CD and it is amazing. Phantom Planet is such a good band! Or should I say they, were, such a good band. The only thing we could think of was how much they are trying to be like ""The Strokes"". It's sad when a band as good as Phantom Planet feels like they have to sound like someone else. Every song sounds the same. I hate to say it, BUT THEY DO!Don't waste your time and money on this CD. Go pick up Coheed and Cambria's new CD if you want to hear something amazing."
3,i miss jason now,"i bought this cd as soon as it came out, i was so excited for a new album. i wasn't sure what they'd sound like because of Jason being replaced- i didn't like the sound of ""Big Brat,"" but i figured it couldn't have changed the band too much.after listening to the whole thing, i was pretty dissapointed. the drums take over the songs too much. and i was in love with Jason Schwartzman's voice. Alex's voice is alright, but all the songs sound like Hot Hot Heat.hopefully it will take some getting used to and everything will be alright. this album is a whole new genre compared to what Phantom Planet was previously."
2,Change Not A Good Thing For Phantom Planet,"Of course, after this review is posted, it will rake up like 12 people not agreeing with me, but the truth is that most people who review CDs online either LOVE or HATE the CD being reviewed, and therefore will strongly disagree with eachother. I, however, am pretty neutral about this CD. I bought the album with very high hopes. I heard that they kinked the sound a little, and I was excited, but when I listened to it, it didn't sound like they were trying to change their sound, it sounded like they were following the mainstream trend of the Strokes/Vines/White Stripes/Hives ect. ect. Also, it's... well.... not good at all really. They have almost no musicianship on the album. This CD just left me dissapointed in Phantom Planet. I now regard them more as sellouts than anything else. Worst album ever? Not at all. Best album ever? Not even a chance."
1,sounds like....?,"New Phantom planet sounds just like the Strokes and all those other useless bands that use crappy microphones, megaphones and date drew barrymore.I think I liked planet phantom more when they sucked.I guess emo was on its way out anyway.Listening to this was almost as bad as seeing Jennifer Aniston wear an MC5 tee-shirt on Friends."
4,Its still Michael,"After seeing Michael perform in Las Vegas last week, I went back and listened to some of his original work. Previously is somewhat overproduced and all over the music landscape but it's still Michael. There is enough here to interest either a new fan or someone who has followed him for over thirty years.Incidently, his show at Boulder Station was very well attended. Too bad they scheduled him at 8:00 PM before a rock re-creation band at 10:00 PM. He had only an hour and twenty minutes to entertain us. I was front row center. After all these years he still loves the music he wrote! The band was great. Just not enough time."
2,My Xtrememac case is better than this.,"First of all, I have an email address, I just don't want to subscribe to amazon. Well this ipod case is not the best. there better ones out there. When I first got this case, I thought it rocks, But I was wrong. The silicone was sticky so it attracted a lot of dirt and other crap, It had no air vents in tha back, And the screen protector was silicone so it attracted dust to the screen, and after a couple weeks, it ripped! There are better cases out there like the xterememac silicone sleeve. It has vents in the back so it keeps the ipod cool, It has so screen protector, but I bought some great hard plastic ones, and the silicone is not sticky. It's harder but it gives better protection. It would go with the Xtrememac sleeve or the iskin."
1,Don't waste your money,This television has numerous problems and you can search the model yourself on google .. it gets white lines going across the top couple inches after a few months in most cases and wont power up at random times for weeks at a time ... if you get these issue fixed you'll have a tv for another 6 months or so .. but for 200-400 dollars its not worth the money!
4,Great Spice Bottles,These are great. I ordered 2 sets and it was just enough for all my spices. The only thing I would change is to have 2 sizes for the holes in the lid. The size you get are a little large for salt.
5,perfect for my needs,"I recently moved and have acquired more cabinet space. I consolidated all my spices into a more convenient location in my kitchen. My spices are now uniform in size. The shaker tops are extremely helpful since chopped onions require a different size than, say, nutmeg. I compared prices, sizes, etc from different companies and this, by far, was the best deal around. I would definitely purchase from this company again, since I will be canning and preserving in the very near future. BRAVO!!!"
5,Awesome,"These jars work great for my spices. I use my label maker to keep them organized on my spice rack.The plastic tops stay on good, and I like that they're white so that I know the tops are clean. The box was packaged well and they are a fantastic deal."
4,Handy Jars,"They're working out very well for me. Unfortunately they're not quite (sooo close) the same size of the spice jars I have, even thought they look the same, so I have to be sure to keep the right lids with the right jars. Otherwise, they're great!"
4,fully functional,"used to upgrade my LC-1 kidney pad. Color doesn't match perfectly but it is certainly close enough. If made in USA, it would have gotten that 5th star."
3,Swim with the sharks and eat them alive,"_Eat or Be Eaten_ is morbidly fascinating reading for people who don't have to climb the corporate ziggurat. The author details his experiences with different tactics of office politics. Although he is obviously highly disciplined and determined, with expertise out the ears and an incredible capacity for work, he does not make himself the hero of his own battles. He honestly relates his own defeats and blunders, explaining how some of the tactics in his book were used on him, or how he mis-used them. Tellingly, there are rationalizations of some hardball tactics that almost sound like the stirrings of a guilty conscience. In one instance, he sabotages a colleague's career to save his own, and spends some ink justifying it. But such moments quickly give way to a resumption of office tactics and career strategies. A foot soldier's eye view of the corporate battlefield..."
2,Old Spice,"I like Dynasty Chinese Five Spice as a product. I use it in stir fry. It is a strong flavoring that works well for me since I reduce my sodium intake. I wasn't able to find it locally when I ran out, so I decided to buy the 6 pack choice thinking it should last for a year and a half or so. In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice. Disappointing."
5,Find The Killers And Deliver Justice,"""Years before he became famous as an Arizona Ranger,young Samuel Burrack was just another free spirit eager to experience life on his own in the West.When his best friend is murdered,his first instinct is simple---FIND THE KILLERS AND DELIVER JUSTICE.....""[from the book of back cover]"
5,lovely,"I love this set, it was just what I was looking for. The previous reviewer was correct, the rocks are white but I had collected my own rocks from the beach and I threw them in and it looks like the picture. I'm sure someone else can do the same."
3,RING... RING... RING...,"""Helo?"" ""Yeah, hold on a sec."" ""HEY, LEATHAL WEAPON 4!"" ""GET THE PHONE!"" ""IT'S THE FIRST THREE LEATHAL WEAPONS!"" ""THEY WANT THIER SCRIPT BACK!""Talk about working from a template, this movie is totaly unoriginal. It's the same dopey saxaphone playing in all those moments of Gibson and Glover's self deprication. It works about one movie's worth and that was spent on the first one.So, why 3 stars? Because the features make up for the lame sunday night network T.V. story line. Great menu design and nice touch with the deleted scenes from all the previous movies."
1,Should have been called Lethal Weapon 4: Swearfest,"I am not one to ever complain about bad language, violence, nudity, etc. in a movie. However, this movie used the F*** word so many times that I was completely disgusted. The script was so poor that the writers must have thought throwing in the F*** word in every sentence would somehow improve it. I am a big fan of the first three movies, but this one is a disgrace... Don't waste money even renting this garbage..."
4,I love the lethal weapon series and this one is great,I think this is a great movie that deserves academy awards its funny and exciting and thats what I look for in a movie>
2,Lots of fighting and terrible ending,"The people who knew Jet Li did not like the ways it ended. I like to watch him as a good guy and not as a villan. He is the best kung fu fighter I watched, even better than Jackie chan."
4,funny and action packed,"I dont know which one is funnier the 1st or 4th. Anyway they both have my vote. Everyone in this film is so very funny, a dry kinda humor, not like austin powers where they over do it. I usually do not like action movies but there was much more to this movie. I think eveyone of all ages would enjoy this movie"
2,"""4"": hopefully the finale in this fading series","""Lethal Weapon 4"" has three things going for it: the cast's excellent chemesitry, the emphasis on humor, and the amazing energy put out by the cast and crew. Now, plot and logic has never been the strong point of any of the previous ""Lethal Weapon"" films, but in this movie, the plot is a ridiculous excuse for car chases and outrageous action sequences. Chris Rock is an appreciated addition. He and Joe Pesci steal the stage everytime they're on screen."
1,The end of cinema,"This movie is representative of Hollywood decline. It is full of racial cliches : the chinese is a bad man. The violence is gratuitous and there is neither plot nor acting. Mel Gibson with this stupid movie only wants to earn a lot of money and he does it very well. I don't understand why people want to see gratuitous violence in that sort of ""movie"", don't they think there is enough violence in the US ? what is the moral of the movie ? It could be resumed like that : I don't like that man so I shoot him, in another way, violence is considered as the essential way to communicate for a man. The formula of the movie is simple : you mix violence, explosions, car crashes and you make a blockbuster."
5,Funny!!!,It was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. I loved the parts where they talk about the cell phone and the part where Danny Glover strips to his boxers and Mel Gibson makes fun of him. ***** 5 star
4,Railroaded,"I thought this was a very good book to read. It started off slow (like most books do). Once into the book, it took off and proved to be interesting. It was a twister, and I look forward to reading the sequel."
4,It deserved better,"I've often wondered if I'm the only person alive who saw ""Seesaw!"" It's been sadly neglected. Michele Lee was wonderful, and it was a great introduction to a guy named Tommy Tune.. The music is very enjoyable. Highly recommended for Broadway show lovers!"
3,Manon blu-ray disc,Excellent sound and video.I bought this disc because I'm a big fan of Anna Netrebko. She has a unique voice and stage presence.I was not disappointed though I'm not that crazy about having the plot moved up to a more modern era.The quality of the disc really blew me over.
4,Nice fit if you order right,Loved it but I went be previous reviews and made sure I ordered Extra Large even though most other tanks in extra large become a parachute on me when I walk from the car to the gym but this one fit perfect.You cannot order the size you normally wear or you will go through the hassle of reordering another one.
4,Ame Son - 'Catalyse' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1970, as this was, of course this French psych / space rock collective's first lp. Total of eight songs to cause some significant brain damage within. Tunes here I got the most out of were the soothing cosmic ""Seventh Time Key / I Just Want To Say"", ""Reborn This Morning On The Way"", ""A Coup De H / Les Sables Mouvent"" and the very well lively-played ""Je Veux Juste Dire"" [heard they toured France a little after this album] came out. Personnel: Bernard Lavialle - guitar, Patrick Fontaine - bass, Francois Garrel - flute & voice and Marc Blanc - drums & voice. Recommended for fans of Gong, Daevid Allen, Alice (early '70's French progressive 2 lp band) and possibly Gentle Giant or Traffic. Overall, a nice find."
3,Important to remember,"Despite the fact that this looks like a 60s Blue Note record, it was, in fact, recorded in 1985.It is not the whole concert by any stretch of the imagination."
5,One of the best . . .,"William Finn. What is there to say? This man has created the most memorable family in the history of Musical Theatre. And here they are. Marvin, Trina, Jason, Whizzer, and Mendel will sing their way into your heart in this powerfully funny tale of broken marriage and self-discovery. A must for every serious Musical Theatre lover. ""March of the Falsettos"" is actually the second part in the Marvin Trilogy. Perhaps with enough pressure, we can get the first installment, ""In Trousers"" released on CD! Hmmmm. See also ""Falsettoland."""
2,Shakespeare Demeaned....,"This disturbing 'biography' is pure fiction and shows that anyone can write a book and get it published if you have connections. This is the silliest thing I have ever heard. The writer spent a lot of time making comparisons when there are none to be made.Marlowe wrote only seven plays in his young life, 'Dr. Faustus' the best known, and his poem ""Hero and Leander"" the only poem to outlive him. Perhaps with his interest in the occult and Satanism, a rumor has run amok that he returned in the adult human form of a famous playwright and literary figure, the prolific William Shakespeare. It's the darnest thing I ever saw. The majority of the fiction is about Shakespeare and very little about the man himself.Having been murdered at such a young age, there will always be speculation as to the cause. ""Afterlife"" -- I don't think so! It is all foolish hypothesis, and to dignify it at all in print is preposterous."
1,"Whoops! Thought it was happy hardcore, huh?",This CD is NOT happy hardcore... I don't even know what to call it. It sucks! Another horrible thing about it is that the entire CD is one big long mixed track. So that means no skipping from song to song on your CD player. But if you are looking for music more along the lines of REAL happy hardcore (eg. like Anabolic Frolic) then try the Bonkers series.
2,not communicative,"as an instructor using this book I find the examples inadequate, the vocabulary spotty, the grammar not systematic or complete."
1,disappointing,This was a very disappointing experience for online shopping. I purchased this DVD together with together with several others only to find that the disc is not able to be played in this zone being Australia. I would have liked to have known there was zoning on DVDs before I purchased this item and others. I dont think I will ever purchase another DVD online again.
3,Good Purchase,"I've seen the Doobies a couple of times reciently. They are a much better band now than they were then. This band can rock!!!!!! They have had so many different members over the years, that they have been able to take on somewhat different personalities - all which were very good. This DVD kind of showes it all. It's a good DVD which showes the energy captured back in 1982. I recommend it. However, if you only get one Doobie DVD, get Live at the Wolf Trap. Fantastic live performance! It's just like they look and sound today."
1,Very Cheap Looking,"They are the cheapest priced quarter windows louvers for a reason. They are flat black, not painted, they have no slits, and are made of a cheap looking plastic. Spend the extra money for a better set. After I returned these I bought the DG Custom louvers and they match perfect and look great!2010 2011 2012 10 11 12 Ford Mustang Painted Quarter Window Louvers Black Paint Code UA"
1,Worst frost blanket ever.,I live in Florida and thought these frost blankets would come in handy when we get a couple of frost days . Well needless to say after getting our first frost and using this product it had no protection what so ever. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Can't Download Most of the Code,"While coverage of MS-SQL Server stored procedures in this book is adequate, the back cover promises, ""All the code and examples in the book can be downloaded from the companion Web site.""A visit to the publisher's site will allow the reader to download the code from just two of the 16 chapters. Two weeks after this omission was pointed out there has been no response from the publisher."
5,Just teriffic,"This is one of the soundtracks that once you hear it,you justwant to hear it again.I am a soundtrack nut and I would rate this a 5.."
4,Good historical narrative,"Great review of possibly the most important day of the twentieth century, and the catalyst for the rise of the American empire. Definitely worth the time for 20th century historians, military historians and an invaluable tool for military staff rides."
3,Maps imposssible to read in Kindle edition,"The book provides a detailed account of the battle of Omaha Beach. There are many maps, many of the small encounters that were the essence of the US victory. They are impossible to see on Kindle, way too small. That detracts considerably from the value of the Kindle edition."
3,Their weakest LP,"There are some great tracks on this album, but go with Sloppy Seconds Vol2 which features a couple of tracks off here, but perfected (eg Kno's weak rap is removed from Nasty Filthy - pheww!) Will Rap For Food, their first LP is also superior. This LP just feels a little bland in places. I must be the only person on the planet to not be impressed by Seasons. And the track SouthernUnderground with its fantastic flute sample is totally ruined by an annoying stab sound every 3 seconds..One bit i do love, is the WQN5 skit featuring a spoof Baha Men track called Monkey Monkey Monkey, but its no reason to buy this album. Seriously check out their other 2 long plays before you hate me."
3,Book never really comes together,"Basically, the author's premise is that Jews have been seen as white at some points in history in the United States and as not-quite-white in others. Okay, fine --- my grandparents have told me about their experiences with those different perceptions. Brodkin then tries to illustrate these changing perceptions in her book. She is only partially successful. Her arguments, which are interesting, just never totally gel and she is prone to sweeping generalizations and massive amounts of repetition to get her point across."
3,A commendable attempt at the impossible,"I think it is nearly impossible to write a textbook on world history with the perfect combination of objectivity, factual accuracy and accessibility to students. While this book does a good job with the first two criteria, it fails significantly in its presentation. While this was not much of a problem for me since I like history in general, the dry writing style employed in this book will turn off many students taking introductory classes and who may not be the biggest fans of history. Unfortunately, in a country where people are desperately lacking knowledge and understanding of cultures in other parts of the world, this textbook seems to be the best in the market for now. Hopefully, a newer edition will be an improvement."
1,Gay shirt for gay emos,"Gay shirt for a gay emo fellow. Is the shirt supposed to infer the phrase ""Cock big?"" Ya i want a shirt that says cock big. Who makes this shyte?"
