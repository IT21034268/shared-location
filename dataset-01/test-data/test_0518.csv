4,Does what it's supposed to!,"When I read why you are supposed to use he detergent, it said that it produced only a small amount of soap suds, which prolong the life of your front load. It hardly produces any at all and it has a nice, light smell. Its convient to get it off Amazon because a lot of grocery stores don't carry it yet."
4,"Great detergent, so-so deal","I'm giving this only four stars because of value. The detergent itself is great, but I can get it at Target stores in my area for $6.99 per same-size box. At that price, four boxes are about $29, including sales tax, so the Amazon price isn't really that great. If you can't find it locally for a reasonable price, though, then get it here."
4,Love them- great bulk package,"My only complaint is that there aren't more strips in an insert, but this package solves that problem so I don't run out in a big gift wrapping frenzy (usually around Christmas)"
1,broke after 8 months,"UPDATE:The cable just stopped heating a few weeks ago. If they sent me a free replacement, I wouldn't take it, because it's not worth enough to pay me for the 10 or so hours it would take to lift 30 lbs of sand and all the landscaping out of my tank to replace this thing. *Sad*OLD REVIEW:The cable is heating my tank nicely, under a sand bed. I'm using it with a thermostat.The installation was a bit alarming, because the suction cups only stayed on for 5 minutes at first. Then I reset them 3-5 times, and they stayed on long enough to cover the cable with the sand. I'm pretty sure they're stuck in place just fine under the sand, but I would not use them without substrate or with easily movable one."
5,Norpro Grip-EZ Measuring Cups and Spoons Set,I particularly like these because they are so easy to hold on to and easy to store too. I am very pleased with these.
3,Not Horrible,"I do a lot of baking so maybe I'm just a little more picky than someone who would only use these occasionally. I like that they come in so many sizes, especially the 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup. They are deeper than I would have liked, which makes it harder to dig into some containers without making a mess. But my biggest complaint is something I didn't notice until the first time I used them. I received 2 ""1/2"" tsp's instead of 1 ""1/2"" tsp and 1 ""1"" tsp. Very annoying since the tsp is probably the most popular size when I bake. So I guess I'll continue to use my old set as well!"
1,Not impressed,"I got this DVD with the intent of LEARNING to hip hop. At first the instructor starts off nice and slow with the arm and trunk motions. But after the first section, she goes really fast without breaking down the steps. I could rewind it forever trying to figure it out on my own. If you already know how to hip hop, or are a quick learner, this might be for you, but it's not for me!"
2,Very Disappointing,This book was very tiny - only about 3x3 inches. I can't remember what I paid but I expected a normal book size. This was supposed to be a gift and I threw it into the charity bin instead.
3,Very small book!,"This is a very small book! I wish I would have known the size before I purchased it. Richard Scarry is great, but I would have prefered a book that is bigger than the palm of my hand."
3,Really small!,"I did not realize this was a ""diaper bag"" or small board book. It is a lot smaller than a regular sized board book, so I am a bit disappointed."
5,Chunky book,"This book is perfect for the diaper bag, stroller, car rides, etc. Kids love the great illustrations and easy to turn pages."
2,Tiny board book,"It's cute and a short read, but it's really tiny and doesn't keep my toddler as enthralled as a larger (normal sized) board book. Nice for a diaper bag or in the car, maybe."
2,Gabrielli Meets Wagner?,"In order to counterbalance the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this recording, I felt it neccesary to add some much needed criticism. This is not meant to undermine the playing on this recording which is close to flawless, but to promote historically accurate performances of early music.If you want to hear great brass playing and don't care about musical interpretations or historical accuracy, buy this recording. Where else can you hear the brass sections of three of America's finest orchestras playing together at the same time?On the other hand, if you are looking for a recording of Garielli's music played the way Gabrielli would have heard it in the cathedral of St. Mark's in Venice, you will want to look elsewhere. I highly recommend any of the recordings by Concerto Palatino or His Majesty's Sagbutts and Cornetts (both use authentic instruments)."
4,Illuminator Reflector Panel,"We purchased this as a gift at Christmas. The only problem we noticed is with the directions. Once it was unwound, we couldn't get it back into its bag. It would be nice for the manufacturer to show how to twist it back. Overall, this is a great accessory for serious photographers."
4,It is outdated,"I recommend this book to you because it has large pictures, but keep in mind most of these ones were taken about last 80's and doesn't show the actual city skyline."
5,Excellent Tape Dispenser,"This is a basic, no frills tape dispenser.It's weighted so it stays in place when you need tape so it can easily be operated with one hand. The tape holder flips up so there's no parts to lose.It varies in price quite a bit, so be watchful and you can get it at a great price.No complaints here. It does what it needs to."
3,"OH! BETTY ,GRABLE NEARLY LOSES IT","well its 1953, betty has been off the screen for a year, marilyn has been stalking the fox lot doing small pics, then she dos niagra , bettys away on suspension , zanucuk has to pay grable $400,000 a year ($15 million in todays money) while he can have monroe for peanuts, so monroe gets gentlemen prefer blondes and grable gets farner, well grable dos millionaire with monroe as her next movie then goes to columbia for three for the show, grable throws in the towell, leaves fox goes to television and las vegas. betty oh betty."
4,'Step by Step Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Programming',This is a well written book suitable for beginners like myself with limited exposure on database etc. The examples are clear and free of errors. I completed the first 21 chapters in two days. I would recommend this book to anyone new to the subject of SQL servers.
5,"Extremely good quality for a low, low price!","This fan is very well made and really does the job! Some reviewers complained that it was noisy but I don't see how a fan could blow air with such force and not create some noise. Also, some complained that the plastic 'feet' were fragile. Personally, I feel that they are completely adequate. If they were made of steel or cast iron the fan would weigh a ton! All in all, I am completely satisfied with this fan and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful fan that pushes a huge quantity of air."
5,Fantastic fan!`,"I purchased this fan to replace the exact same fan that we've had for around twenty years. Placed in front of a window, it cools our house quickly and quietly in the evening. I keep one of its four support legs off, so it can be placed right up against the wall, with the fan portion inches from the window. Amazon got it to us quickly, with free shipping."
5,"old skool, out of print book ,","this book is most def one of a kind printed in the 50's this one is for the serious collector,ans most def a very hard to find book, i think this is the book that ed hardy borrow the name from ,for the re released of the pierced hearts and true love,,"
3,not quite worth the amazon price...,"This is one of those cartoons where the best part (and one of the only few good parts) is the climax of the final episode. I must admit that that is the only reason that I purchased this DVD; you might get a chuckle or two from O1 (Ichiro), but the sad ending is the only good thing. it sort of puts an endcap on the original Android Kikaider: The Animation series."
4,Very informative - but you'll need an icepack for your head,"Fifteen years ago I did research in this area and had just completed a math degree. I thought it would be interesting to get back up to speed.I found the book fascinating, tremendous work has been done in this field and this is a good broad treatment of it. For anyone who is into computer science but has never studied the brain it will be a tremendous eye opener.But boy, was it hard work. I found I had to read & re-read sections just to understand some of the math involved. In fairness the book does cover everything you need but if you have never done college level math, or you have forgotten most of it, then don't tackle this book when you are tired!"
2,not for me,"12 tone music , which some might consider willfully discordant .To write this stuff must have been an enormous challenge , to sing and play it requires musicians of an incredibly rare talent . But admiring the music is not the same as liking it"
2,Not necessarily for non-Ligeti fans,Contrary to another review on this page this music is definitely a special interest item. Preview the music before you buy it. The missing three stars are for my lack of interest in the music. The performances are all top-notch. The quality of the recording is very good. Two stars for the performaces and the sound.
4,His Legacy Still Survives.,"Most or many of the stories like his banishing all of the snakes from Ireland are false. They are the evidence of exaggerated storytelling. Actually he was born in Britain in the fourth century. He was taken prisoner by a group of Irish raiders and transported to Ireland where he spent six years in captivity. He was guided by visions to become a missionary to convert the Irish to Christianity.Actually, his family were not deeply religious, but most Irish practiced a pagan religion. This was changed due to the activities and beliefs of this saint. Spinning exciting tales to remember history has always been a part of Irish life. I always thought that my mother, Lettie Lane, was Irish. After seeing the PBS special, I am sure of it, though she did not have the lilting dialect, coming from the mountains of Union County. She died when I was seven. Alec was born on March 17. His brother Eric is a 711 child. It is thought that St. Patrick died on this date."
2,To much money for this short cd.,I have paid to much money for this cheap cd. So next time I have to be carefull next time. The music is o.k.
2,Lacked authenticity,"I expected tales of actual experiences from this area of the country. Instead, I got a collection of campfire tales. All in all a disappointing purchase."
1,review HD-ads,CD contains (not too high quality) scans of HD ads from 1970 until 2003.What did I expect? A HD sponsored CD with all ads from the company over the years.What do you get? About 5 to 11 pictures per year and quality is not to good. Scans were made from hardcopies of ads in magazines tec. Some you can even see the mid-fold of the magazine!Print options are poor. No preview or possibility to modify prints.
3,so so,"the cover looks nice as the picture. However the fabric is nylon or something which generates static electricity all the time.One more thing i was wondering before i bought it is whether the back of the seat is covered. Since the back of my car seat a net pocket, I don;t want it be covered. It turns out to be not a problem.oppppppppps...........it is broken now, 05/05/2007. speechless."
4,"Good, interesting book about weather for young children","I have been searching for some books to explain more complicated concepts of weather on a level that seems appropriate for our weather theme in Kindergarten. I liked this book for ""where we're at"" in our studies. Many books have already taught us the concepts of seasons, hot and cold, weather measurement tools, etc. This book explains the formation of icicles, what slush is, and how a rainstorm can become a hailstorm in a personalized way from William's point of view. It doesn't cover everything, but it's a good addition to read aloud to the Kindergarten students."
5,one of my all-time favorites,"This cd has been out since 1997, if I'm not mistaken. I knew just a few of these songs. Then a few months ago, my sister sold me her tape for $1 and I haven't put it down since! My favorite song on here is ""Center Aisle""... that song will make you cry, it's so well written. And another favorite is ""Standing Up For Nothing"". That song will make you think. Derek and Aaron are amazing songwriters. It's not just that ""love makes the world go round"" stuff that tends to get on your nerves. It's really honest and awesome music. I highly recommend this cd."
2,I didn't like this cd,"The songs aren't all that great. I guess it's just not my tipe of music. The words are good, but the music isn't. I wouldn't buy this cd. If you're looking for ""Excellent"" music and ""Excellent"" lyrics, check out ""dcTalk"""
5,"It's not unabridged, but it won't insult your daily vocabulary/dictionary needs.","This dictionary is exactly what I needed... more complete than many of the 20,000 - word ""large print"" being offered today, yet very affordable. It is hard-backed; a real ""use it for years"" reference book. It is printed on a much better grade of paper than the bargain models (the ones that feel a bit like fine sandpaper to the touch). You can lay this book down open to any page and it stays open! This volume is a bit too much of a load to carry around with you. But if you are looking for a good desk-reference dictionary, or one for home use to check spelling or proper useage, and you require larger print; I believe this will suit your purposes.It's also a great mental exercise once in awhile to use a dictionary rather than just a spell-check."
5,Large print dictionary,"Great Dictionary. Having trouble with my vision, but I can see the words very easy. Would highly recommand this to anyone having trouble with small print."
4,One for all !!!,"Buy this book and you will know all you need to know about pet bird. You will find your suitable bird and how to make it healthy, happy. This book also teach you how to tame and train your intelligent bird. I love this book very much but if you want to know bird breeding in detail and enjoy beautiful photo, you may disappointed. Lack of color photo make me reduce 1 star when I rated but if you don't care, this book is a good choice for you. In my view, it is best to read if you are beginner in pet bird."
5,Exactly what I needed,"Yes, I agree setup is difficult if you are not computer saavy. But I got it opened, configured, and playing music/slides on my family room TV in less than 2 hours while working on other things.I haven't done playlists, but overall I like the performance and interface. A great low cost option for people who have a wireless network and want to display photos or play music. Now I can move my CD Carousel to another room in the house!"
2,Needs refinement,"I've had this product for about a year now. I have used it extensively and find it works well for the most part. It is a good media adapter for SMALL collections of music and pictures. When your collection grows, this wont grow with it. I have a huge music collection, organized in many folders. It takes the media adapter about 5 minutes to start up. If I remove folders, it starts substantially faster.Wireless performance is good. Setup is so-so. Image quality is good. Sound quality is pretty good. Remote control sucks bad. Software included is easy to set up, just don't update Windows with the Microsoft .NET framework update or service pack. Updating the framework renders this device useless, as the software stops functioning.Bottom Line:1. Good for the casual collection, good sound, good images.2. Impresses people (still can't figure out why)3. Remote control is simply awful (Program a universal remote insted)4. Look into D-Link media adapter (might be better)"
1,There is a reason it is cheap,"If your configuration is:1 PC, a simple router and a TVANDYou are running Win 2000 OR are confident you can configure Windows XP Firewall at an Administrator levelANDYou check the support for the product on the Linksys web site and realize that is as good as it is going to get.ANDYou don't mind yet another background process running on your PCANDYour files are not on a network drive or a mapped driveThis might be for you......Otherwise - forget it - period"
2,disappointing - wait for the next or 3rd generation,"I set up this product with a belkin router (g) and a pc running XP w/ sp2. The media adapter was not easy to configure with this hardware (2.5 hours on the phone w/ Linksys). The WMA11b's software seems to have conflicts with service pack 2 which I have still not been able to resolve.Once it was up and running it was kind of a novelty to finally be able to stream my music and photos to a TV and stereo.Though the distance from my router to the adapter was only 20 feet, the reception was never good. Perhaps because of this, the sound quality was always poor.Finally, to search for music you must do it with your TV on which was a little irritating. A unit that can display your music library info on the remote control would be worth the extra $$.After a week of attempting to live with the less than stellar music quality I gave up and returned this product. I wish I could now return my PC to pre-WMA11b qualities as well.."
1,horrible. Re-wiring is simper!,What a horrible product. I absolutely cannot make this product work and Linksys will not help. Under no circumstances should you but this.
4,This is what portable gaming is meant for!!!!,"EA Games has pushed the PSP to it's limits with this game.The graphics are almost PS2 quality just a little bit choppy.And OMG,the 32 player online gameplay is un frekin bealeveable.It is like HALO 2 on xbox live and i have it for xbox 360 folks.This is free online play.unlike Xbox live which is $5 a month.Anyway buy this game at Ebgames or Gamestop and try it.If u dont like it return it.But 80 out of 100 people could not put this game down.It is only $40.That is kinda expensive but wait 2 to 4 months and u will get it for $30 or $25.Please try it.U will not be dissapointed."
3,PSP games are watered down,"My kid played about a week and now it is a paperweight, I played once on a plane trip and I didn't like it."
5,Fodor's Vancouver and British Columbia 5th Edition,We loved it. Fodor's is always a great choice for a travel book. we loved Vancouver and found the book extremely helpful.
4,measuring glass,I wish that the measuring cup indicated all individual teaspoons & tablespoons. I guess I needed a 4 oz. cup as the one I had before. I just assumed that it would show all the measurements. It arrived in good condition and quickly.
1,don't buy this!,The lettering on this measure cup did not last even 2 weeks and we were very careful with it.This is a big ripoff - expensive and useless. I would return it but i did not keep packagingand receipt - DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,don't buy this item!,I love the idea of this item. It's exactly what I need. I've looked all around and thought I'd finally found what I wanted. Alas the writing comes right off of the glass on the first washing. I have Pyrex items that are decades old and the writing it still intact. Too bad. I really wanted this to work out :(
5,I love this CD,I hadn't heard much Ligeti when I bought this. It quickly turned into one of my most-played CDs. Highly recommended.
3,"Very Detailed Book, Too Detailed for a Beginner","This is a good book. It is full of content and has extremely detailed maps. The photographs are excellent. I am new to astronomy, the book and maps are a little to detailed for a beginner. If you are a beginner, there are better books. It is a book that I can grow into."
5,The Ultramarines represent loyalty and courage,"The Ultramarines represent loyalty and courage, fighting against the enemies of mankind: this premise fostered a trilogy of novels which here appear under one cover. It's a pleasure to see NIGHTBRINGER, WARRIORS OF THE ULTRAMAR and DEAD SKY here - plus a new connected short story: under one cover the story flows smoothly and evenly.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,It leaves my hair looking shiny and greasy,"I've used it twice, the first time I dont' think I used it right because I didn't make my hair wet with it so my hair looked really greasy. The second time I used it I followed the directed exactally and my hair still looks really greasy. (and it's only been a day since I've showered and shampooed with real shampoo) It makes my hair look worse that the day after showered look."
1,Not suitable for me,"I thought that the product can be used like a spray, spray it on your hair and clean it by a towel. But it turned out that we have to make our hair wet"
5,Good Deal,"Like most everyone else, I had a heavy plastic dispenser, but no core. Instead of ditching the whole thing, I just purchased a core. Ironically, it cost the same to buy a whole unit. But, I couldn't bare to toss an otherwise functional hunk of plastic because I lost a piece.It's black and my dispenser is off-white so now I've got a two toned thing going on."
4,Quit wishing for Mom's,"Heating elements in the sides, not just the bottom. Got nice and hot. Inserts seem a little unstable, but haven't used them yet. Maybe they are better when they have some weight in them. Don't care much for the ""serve through"" lid, but can see where it could be useful. It's not Mom's 1950's Westinghouse, but I'm happy."
2,Good Quality?,"Bought a ""Good"" book and it came with multiple front cover dog ears and it looked like it went through the wash. I'd hate to buy a ""Bad"" book from these people!"
4,"Wears well, but...","...I need a wider selection, or at least a few more color choices, in the Warm category. BUT I will say, this lipcolor wears very well. Use, when not using this product, the best available lipcare/lipbalm you can afford, however, especially overnight. Otherwise, you will probably get dry lips. I live in Colorado, so I know. ANYWAY, the colors: Scarlett is a very COOl red. I am a redhead/auburn-head with gold highlights and pale, warm-undertoned skin. I can't wear cool lip colors without looking drained and sick. So, I'm disappointed with the Scarlett and one of the other paler colors of which I cannot remember the name. I am ordering the whatever Coral color now. I'm doing this online because local drugstores are often not fully stocked with all or most of the colors in this product line."
5,Stays on Forever: Revlon at Amazon,"This lipstick really stays on for a full day and probably longer if you don't take it off at night before sleeping. It also stays on coffee cups, spoons, etc. through a dishwasher cycle so check carefully when unloading the dishes to be put away or your house will look like a bad restaurant. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover to remove it at night and I have read that some people use baby oil. If you want to go all day without worrying about your lipstick, this is the product for you. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is in it to make it stay on so long, but it's probably better for my peace of mind not to know."
4,"great pigmentation, forms weird plasticky coating on lips","For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try."
3,Not an All-Purpose Glue,"I think this glue is best used for porous surfaces like stone, wood, drywall, foam, rug material, cloth and brickwork. It dries brittle, with practically no elasticity, so I don't recommend it for automotive applications where there is a lot of mechanical vibration. It also takes longer than 24 hours to dry, and it foams and leaves a lot of run-off. So if you have holes or voids to fill, this glue is perfect. I consider Gorilla Glue to be the new improved, waterproof version of white glue. The manufacturer claims this is the world's strongest glue, but I don't think so. And it's not an all-purpose glue like Household Goop, or The Welder."
5,Great,I used this to glue together a split picket on a fence. Be aware that this glue does expand. You will need a clamp or something to put pressure on what you are gluing. You may need to shave off excess glue after the expansion. A dime size glue will grow to about the size of a quarter. Very strong. Hard to get off your hands. I used a gasoline rag and it broke the solvent on my hands.
3,Agree: It is overrated.,"As others have mentioned and it also warns -- plan on expansion while it cures. I glued a broken mahogany bed frame rail that was literally broken in half and it is still holding. This is a pretty substantial structural type repair and I was impressed (I ignored instruction to moisturize or dampen the surface first). HOWEVER, I glued a ceramic coffee cup handle back on an expensive cup following the directions verbatim. It worked well and looked nice for about 4 months and several washes, but then just fell off again like it was never glued -- VERY SURPRISING!! This convinced me that what others have mentioned about it being ""overrated"" is exactly right."
1,Glue dries after single use !,"This glue was very useful for repair on an antique wood chair. However, as others have said, the glue dries/hardens way too fast, including drying/hardening in the tip of the applicator.I pretty much destroyed the applicator trying to unclog it, then almost all the glue in the bottle was dried up. Either consider this a one use product or use another glue is my recommendation.I love these Amazon reviews. I was about to buy another bottle of Gorilla Glue using my Amazon Prime, but then read some of the reviews. Saved me more frustration and $$. (I thought maybe I left the bottle open....but it was sealed tight when I opened it, but hardened.)"
1,Glue??????,"Do not know what planet this gorilla came from? Tell me, what planet are you talking about? My gorilla was the weakest gorilla on my planet. Has not stuck to anything. I used it on metal. Piece fell off. Used it to glue a piece from a picnic table. It fell off. Oh, but it left behind, hard glue on what it was suppose to adhere to. Now, I have to get something to take that off.Opening the bottle was difficult. Then it was tough like a gorilla. Oh, yes and it will stick if you do not clean the tip of bottle, the cover will stick to it. That it sticks to!!!!!!Seen advertisement with the gorilla hanging on to piece that is ""suppose"" to be glued. All I can state, is that he or she must fall a lot."
2,Pretty useless,"I have tried to glue various items using this, even plastic on plastic, nothing sticks. It foams up, and a slight pressure breaks the bond. I will go back to crazy glue. that's not the best, but better than this."
1,Package looks good,Found this product to be totally useless. Followed instructions exactly in using this to attach pads to bottom of chair legs on stool in kitchen. Several hours later picked up bar stool and pads stayed on the flloor. Can't give less than 1 star so gave it 1 star for the packaging!
1,There's a better product out there,"I became frustrated researching this product. It has so many low ratings and the photos of it do suggest that it's flimsy! I was determined to find something similar but with quality construction. We have a short, sloped driveway so I couldn't take any chances on things getting past the fence! To my delight I found the kidcatcher. It uses tension at the bottom and top of the fence to catch both kids and balls! I liken the construction to that of a volleyball fence. Very durable product. I would highly recommend it since it's made better and costs about the same!"
5,Great Little Reference - just like UNIX man pages!!!,"If you're used to UNIX-like man pages, then this is a great guide for Oracle's utilities. Quick, concise, no fluff and well organized. It provides just enough detail where needed but doesn't go into overkill on the topics.It has already saved me a ton of time and if you use Oracle even semi-regularly, this is a must-have."
2,should have read fine print...,"this is an autobiography....not as in true end time prophcy and up to date events...no need to buy folks but is a good read.....noah hutchings is a fine believer, but you don't need the biography for your Christian library...UPDATE: very good info though on Southwest Baptist and the Radio Network.. Mr Hutchings has several fine books...in fact, i think he has publish a 100..."
4,A Civil War buffs book,This book reveals the opinions many of the General officers of the Civil War had about themselves and other General officers. Many of these Generals would not want to read this book. I did though.
4,deep blue,A great guessing game as to who the bad guy was till the very end. Kat Martin wrote of the gorgeous JamaicanIsland so well you could feel the night air on your skin as though you were actually there. The characters had such deep emotions for each other and you routed for their relationship to work out until the last page was turned. Such a great read.
1,Boring,"If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous. I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band. Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant. Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply.Bummed. Really bummed."
3,Best Trip Companion,"On a Trip to Retrace Lewis & Clark's Route from Great Falls MO.to Clarkston WA. this Book was a valuable Trip Companion. It guided beautifully, helped to find important Places and explained them in detail once there.Glad we bought this Book before starting our Trip"
5,"a fantastic, LGBT-inclusive book","I purchased this LGBT parenting book and read it so I would be able to recommend it to my therapy clients. Given that our son just turned 17, I wasn't thinking I would be reading the book as a benefit to myself. Was I ever wrong! It is a gem among books and touched my heart in profound ways. It also made me laugh, sometimes uproariously and other times knowingly. As a gay man who is co-parenting with a bi woman, I found passages that felt like they were right out of our experiences. It is especially valuable that this book talks about spirituality, and about our children being the people they are and how we need to support them, not try to make them what we think they should be. This book is a gift and I have listed it on the GLBT resources web page for the counseling center where I work."
5,"Kaya, American Girl Boxed Set",I purchased this set for my daughter because she loves reading about the American Girls and their stories. The books are great because kids are learning about history in a fun way. Amazon also offers a much better price on this item then the AG website. This is well worth the money.
3,Useless on Solar Panel installs.,It does work but it needs too much light to switch from an open to closed position which keeps your charge control module from letting the energy from the panel reach the battery.I'm sure this does have it's applications but not in Solar Panel systems.
5,very good,"came fast,very good quality and easy to assemble it,the material is very good, very resistant and its very beuatiful too"
5,does the job,"As the subject says, it does the job well...Most ppl complain about problems putting the black part back on, but it's not so bad.. Easier with two people though"
2,Buyer Beware,"I don't write reviews, but this is one I think you should read. I bought this unit 12/7/05 and until 1/25/06 the unit worked fine. I then encountered numerous bugs which ultimately ended in me not being able to listen to the programming I am paying $13.00 a month for. The forums at www.siriusbackstage.com regarding the S50 have been moderately helpful but have given me virtually no hope in terms of seeing this unit to a healthy state again. Unfortunatly my return period has expired and I am left to deal with the less than perfect manufacturer warranty. Luckily I haven't subscribed to the lifetime plan with Sirius, because that only allows the subscriber to switch between receivers 3 times.As with any new technology, I guess there is a period where the bugs need to be worked out, but I STRONGLY suggest waiting until Sirius does extactly that with the S50. At a fraction of the cost, you can go with a more reliable alternative in the meantime."
5,Good reciever,"Just got my s50 and so far so good. Mine came with 1.2 firmware upgrade. I've had XM. I used to have a Sportster. The s50 is excellent. A lot of features that lacked in the Sportster I now have in the s50. Now I can record stuff. I can control the volume with the remote. I can take the radio with me and listen to recorded material. I can pause run into the store or whatever, and return to whatever I was listening to. The unit I have is pretty stable as far as defects and bugs I have seen in some of the reviews. The s50 sits in the dock with confidence. It is mounted and seems solid. If you are thinking about buying this product then I would give it a try... There isn't a better radio for this technology. Also if you listen to the s50 in a standalone configuration you will not believe the quality of the audio. Howard sounds crystal clear. Its as if you have an aux jack plugged right into thier studio."
3,Beware of home kit!!,"I love the S50 for my car and being the portable MP3 playerHOWEVER I just got the home docking kit!!! Big disappointment!! With my old receiver I could just plug it in to the wall, hook up the antenna and turn on any FM radio in the house and hear it. NOT happening here. You MUST hook it up to amplified speakers or a home stereo system. So unless yur stereo is realy loud you can't hear it all over the house. I was hoping to start enjoying the pool and just use my FM station on the boombox to hear the sirius. So I am gonna switch units with my husband and go get an I-Pod. Over all it is a nice unit but I don't think I would have bought it had I known that. Maybe they need to make a boombox for it - instead of a home docking kit."
1,Don't not waste your money on this Sirius Model,"As cool and unique as this unit looks. Don't be deceived. I bought this unit three months ago and I am now on my third replacement. The first unit I had mysteriously stopped powering on one day. After many calls to product support they sent me a new unit. The replacement unit worked fine for three weeks but apparently there is a bug in the S50 software where it gets stuck on a radio station if you take it out of the cradle before the powering it off. Again, talked witn product support and we went through resetting the sofware, doing a manual hard restart. Finally they sent me second S50 so far so good but is has just been a day. My advice is skip this unit. It is still very buggy and has many issues and is not worth the money. The sirius product support is very good and has been helpful through all these problems. If you like Sirius I would go with one of the cheaper models you will be saving yourself a lot of money and aggravation in the long run."
2,"so far, not so good","I thought it was going to be a Tivo for radio -like as advertised. Instead, it locks up when I do have a scheduled recording and the radio on (which by the way caused the radio to stay on all night draining my battery). It does not record in the car at all.The core features i am pleased with, the programming is good -the device's innovative new features aren't so good."
1,"I agree...horrible customer service, bad hardware","I'm extremely frustrated with the S50. Out of the box it would not work transmitting from the docking station to my stereo receiver. Customer service is a cruel, slow, inept joke. Techs will hang up on you. You get put on hold and then are cut off. Finally talk to a human, they'll send you to warranty who will send you to somewhere else and expect to be given bad phone numbers. I got the radio for Christmas 06, and hope I can send it back to get money back. Be warned, this product can be defective, and Sirius customer service will curl your hair if it is straight and straigten it if it is curled. I've wasted hours trying to get simple answers. Most answers I've receive are wrong...I'd get a simpler radio, or none at all from them."
4,Excellent Gloves,"Bought these based on the reviews and was not disappointed. Since I've been using these, my wife has commented on my softer skin.The reasons I give them four stars and not five are because a loop would have been nice for hanging purposes (on the shower caddy) and they don't create/hold later quite as much as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, though, I love these gloves and will continue to buy them. Highly recommended."
4,THE best episode.,"Jack Black runs out of gas on his motor bike and lands in Gabba Land. He makes friends with all the characters and completely cracks our entire household up. I sat here laughing with my toddler nonstop. There is a fun dancey-dance time with Jack and songs as well. DJ Lance also gives Jack a matching orange costume, glasses and hat, talk about HILARIOUS! This episode makes our whole family laugh and smile. Most of all my toddler was hypnotized by Jack Black. Usually my little boy is not a big ""Gabba"" fan but this show in particular is a favorite."
2,Hipster Dufus Fun,"Like ""Barney"" but with hipster aesthetics, ""Yo Gabba Gabba"" exists more for parents (their nostalgic hunger for cool) than kids. It's stylin' but thin, kind of like the disconnected DJ Lance Rock, and the self-parodic, retro, aggressively ""up"" mood bummed me out, though my eyes did bug (kind of like DJ Rock's) when Jack Black donned a matching orange catsuit."
5,loved loved loved,i stumbled upon this show when my son was 6months old it was the only show he would sit somewhat still and actually watch. had lots of songs and color ...things he found interesting. one day i thought i might record one on the dvr so we would always have one. i had no idea it was the one with jack black. he absolutely loved it!!! i mean he actually sat completely still. well as it turned out the darn dvr broke and i no long had the show i tried to but a different one but he just doesnt watch it like he did this one so i finally just had to buy it
5,My son loves them,"I have never tasted those personally, but my five year old loves to chew them. The capsules are the size of a small pea. They have a strawberry smell. Well, I would expect them to taste like fish, because there is fish oil inside.. I am surprised with some reviewers giving them low rating just because of the taste. Here is some common sense: it's FISH OIL, and we take it because it's good for all of us. Forget about the taste for a second."
2,A little overpowering and not a very great smell,"Just purchased this item a month ago...and was a little desappointed. It's a little too strong and the smell isn't as great. I am currently using Jean Paul Gauthier (Le Male) and Pasha (Cartier) they are very strong smelling colones as well but their smell is much more greater, and fresher.Overall If I am spending this much $$$$ on a colone....I am raising my expectations and Amen just didn't meet them...sorry!"
1,The real thing this was not,"Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said "" tester"" . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors. Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes. Im very unsatisfied and now I know to purchase from my reliable vendor for Angel. Thought I was getting a deal but got hosed."
1,"the worst fragance ever, it smell like crap","this perfume, if you can call it that; smells like damp earth, is too strong, even for the night. I feel I wasted my money whith this.jean paul or use water or 212 gio alguo bone that smell good, not this garbage.is more, I will be very clear about this smells like cheap perfume and to top the smell lasts until it hurts your head"
3,Do not buy for baby under 12 months!,After researching different ones I decided on this one because it stated 6+ months. Hopefully they will change that since there is no way that this thing is made for a 6 month old! My baby could slide through just one of the leg holes! Plus he couldn't see over the little toy that was attached. Hopefully we will be able to use it next summer.
2,Just explainations on games you can create,If you can't think of any way to occupy your child or family this book could be for you. There are no actual games to play but it does have some interesting description of games you might want to do. This wasn't all that helpful when I was trying to entertain my grandchildren.
4,Goood product at right price,"Have been buying this shoe for years because it fits me well and is very comfortable. Wish it would last longer, but at the price, it is a good buy."
3,"An ok season, but missing some characters",This season was not nearly as good as the one's that proceeded it. It seemed like they were forced to fill in the last year of college with some generic events and relationships. It's still a part of my collection but I wish it would have been longer and filled in with a few more characters.
4,Not as squishy as the first...,"I'm not too fond of John Gebbia style. The illustrations seem rushed and sketchy. I don't think I'd have ever picked Gloom Cookie up if he'd been the original illustrator. What's with the blobs for hands? It's not THAT hard to draw a hand!Other than that this still a cute series. The story is interesting, the characters are fun, and the setting is gloomy. The artwork is the only reason this didn't get 5 stars."
2,"When she says beginners, she means beginners.","I was dissapointed with this book, because it was exactly what I was trying to avoid. Clement falls into the same trap as so many other authors - they tell you when to meditate, why to meditate, who meditates - but never gives a good explanation on HOW to meditate. She never quite gets to the meat and potatoes of meditation. This is a good book to read if you've never heard of meditation - not one article, not one example of the experience - an absolute beginner. Otherwise, throw this junk aside. There are better, more complete guides available (such as ""The Best Guide to Meditation"" by Victor Davich)."
2,"Dry, Cracked and Flaky","I bought my colorstay overtime lipstick in the hope that it would be different from the Covergirl Outlast lipstick and the Maxfactor Lipfinity but boy was a shocked but NOT SURPRISED that this lipstick acted in the same way as both of those products. Yes it stays put, but it makes your lips go dry and cracked and if you keep re applying the gloss over it it start to flake right off..especially if you accidently rub your lips together. I do not recommend this a lipstick to wear all day but for night time use only since you can apply the gloss once and then when that wears off you will still have a lipstick stain and the dry cracked lips will soon be smooth again when you remove it at night."
3,At least Groucho is still funny,"There are some amusing moments in this film, but it seems badly dated to me. While Groucho is extremely funny at times, Harpo and Chico seem like products of a bygone era when dopey ethnics and soulful mutes represented the apex of comic invention. I smile whenever I see Groucho on screen, but those other two just don't do a thing for me."
5,Scary and Brillant,"This play will leave you stunned. With so many twist that you can not believe what you are reading, this script never left my hand. I was left with this feeling of shock and terror. With mild humor thrown in and random times, this is a must read play for theatre people and the general public alike. I can not wait to direct this show next year. It was truely amazing. BUY IT"
2,terrible,"I love to read plays and performed in many. I was so curious about this play-the book was in excellent condition-got it in time. No complaints there. I read the play and thought it was the worst play. IT's not ""cutting edge"" just dark and morbid. I know we want to go beyond the line but this was just dumb. I would never direct this play and I am directing in Chicago..but to each is own-if you liked it that's what makes the world go round..enjoy"
1,Save your money!!,"After about 1 year the buttons on the base, which only get used for checking messages at my house, started to fail. Problem probably occurred even prior to the 1 year mark, but I didn't notice until it affected the message playback button. Once I discovered the issue, I attempted to power reset the base at which point the entire unit ""locked up"" and could no longer be used. Panasonic's solution was send it in for repair, be without my phone for however long that takes, and all at my cost since I was outside the warranty period.Please, save your money!!! Don't get stuck with a $200+ phone (I purchased additional handsets) that you can't even use. I loved the phone while it was working, but it's only a matter of time until it fails."
2,static hiss...,I bought this since it's the only panasonic with 2 lines.. but the background hiss on it just bothered me too much. I returned it and bought a panasonic DECT phone.. (only 1 line though) and it's crystal clear. If you want no static or hiss in the background I recommend their new DECT phones.
5,KX-TG6702B Works,"We've had this system, along with 5 KX-TGA670B units, for about a month. So far it's worked exactly the way we'd want. The interface with the Phonebook, and call list could be a little less cumbersome, but they work well. It replaced our Siemens system. The speaker function is a welcome addition. Set up was easy except getting our fax machine (with distinctive ring feature) to work with it, but that was more a function of the fax machine than this phone system.It would have been nice to know that the KX-TG6702B=KX-TG6700+1KX-TGA670B (as I understand it)."
5,Great cordless phone system!,"We purchased this phone set along with an additional handset and have had no issues whatsoever with it. We run a small non-profit office and have three phones with two incoming lines. The different rings for each line were a plus, the messages on answering machine are nice and clear, the batteries have kept a charge well, the intercom has come in handy, and they are so easy to use!All in all - we feel this is a great product!"
1,Disappointed,"I based on my prior good experience with Panasonic wireless phones but found this one (KX-TG6702)to be a disappointment. Sound quality on the remote is fair at best. Accessing stored numbers requires 3 key depressions to get into phonebook. The ""soft keys"" are small and recessed. Backlight and small characters make reading difficult. On the plus side the range is adequate.Overall it's probably the least convenient phone I've ever used.Panasonic KX-TG6702B 2-Line 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Expandable Cordless Phone System with 2 Handsets"
2,Works fine until it doesn't,"Bot a 6702 phone in April 2008 from Amazon and about 2 months ago (October 2010) it mysteriously stopped working on line 1, altho line 2 still worked fine on the base and portable units. Called Panasonic who finally agreed there was a problem with the base unit and that it should be sent in for repair. Warranty is only 1 year and it just isn't worth the postage both ways plus unknown repair costs (mostly labor charge) to get this repaired. I wouldn't buy this again but would, instead, by a cheaper unit which makes more sense even if the cheaper unit goes kaput in 2 years."
4,Great books for nurses,"Every nurse can relate to the emotions portrayed in this book. The short story format is perfect for the busy nurse to read. The next time you want to remember that special nurse in your life or the one who helped you through a crises, or if you are a nurse yourself, read this book! It's my second favorite inspirational book -- my first being ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. Giving these kind of inspirational gift books assures that your present lasts longer than candy and flowers and will boost the readers' self esteem! Every nurse I have known who has read these books has loved them!"
1,not impressed,"I was not impressed with this film, clearly presented from an evangelical perspective. If the victims' love of Jesus helps them to forgive, who should be critical?--is one way of looking at their reconciliation with perpetrators. However, several victims talk about the ""devil"" entering the hearts of the Hutu. As long as the Devil is blamed for this appalling genocide, how much progress is really made--for, in the end, no human responsibility is actually taken for it. I would not recommend purchase of this DVD unless one is of strong Christian persuasion--in which case, it would tend to confirm one's own belief system. Otherwise the reconciliation that occurs seems hollow and untrustworthy."
4,Good to Excellent,Everything about this A/C is first class. I love the remote control. The only exception is the limited spread of air. It has a circulating vent but the range is only about 45. So it must be located where that is less of a problem.
5,The Power of Language,"A friend of mine found this book by accident. It is a long story, but the fact of the matter is: there is a God! He read it and said this book will change my life and it did! Napsha is a genius, a writer so powerful, so inspired. There aren't enough superlatives to describe it. If Shakespeare were alive today, he'd write a ""Sonett for Napsha"". Musically, ""Per Elise"" would be ""Per Napsha."" Incredible."
1,Looks are deceiving,"I also couldn't find Miss napsha's name anywhere in this book and I work for a bookseller. We list it under Berman. We have also received some concerns from buyers that the subject matter may be inappropriate for children of this age-group. As for myself, I tend to think many of the reviews of this item are highly over-inflated. The book is just so-so and tends to over glamorize someone who is not perhaps the best role model for young girls to have. I believe they are better women out there who are a much more worthy subject for a series called Women of Achievement. I know I would not wish my daughter to grow up to be another Cher!In fact, just out of curiosity, I found that Napsha seems to live uncannily close to where some of the most glowing reviews for this item seem to geographically located. Almost sounds as though the 5 star rating had a little help from her friends."
4,Book,This books was purchased as a gift. The person I bought it for picked it so I assume it was fine.
4,"This does the job, it gets me out of the house!","I have twins and a toddler, and this was great for the price...and it get's me out of the house! It JUST fits in our mini-van since we took one of the middle captain seats out, if we put it in crossways - it is very long."
3,Can someone answer a ?,"Hello, I am thinking on buying this triple stroller because I am expecting triplet boys this December. I need to know if three infant carseats can latch and lock onto this stroller. If you know the answer- email me at libra2007mg@aol.com. Thank you."
1,Don't Bother Unless You Have To,"I had a surprise baby after my twins were born. I had a top of the line twin stroller for my two year old twins and needed something affordable that would fit the twins and the newborn. I ordered this stroller and I was extremely disappointed. Part of it was sticking out of the box when it arrived. It was very heavy to push and as others said, the middle seat is very tight. In addition, it is very hard to push -- it pulls to the left quite significantly. It is worth spending the extra money in order to buy a stroller that is easy to push, and large enough to hold three children as they grow."
3,"Works, but bad workmanship","I used this to add a MP3 player to my car. I thought about making my own cable, but this was cheap enough that I used it instead. I removed the 3.5mm jack from its holder and mounted it in my ashtray. As I was working with it, one of the solder joints on the jack broke off. When I cut away the shrink tubing, I found the other two wires with really flimsy solder joints and an overall sloppy job. I ended up restripping the wires and resoldering them. Looks hundred times better. Other than that, works as advertised; just handle it very gently."
4,Simple Product That Works Great,"I wanted to organize all the keys in the household, and I wanted something that was affordable and easily organizable.This system works to perfection.It's color coordinated and holds the keys very well in each slot. My only grip is that the labels read sideways in the holder.4/5."
3,Difficult but interesting,"Grey has a difficult style typical of his time period and texts of the early 20th century. It makes this book very hard to wade through, esp. when added to his repitious style. Still, this gives an alternative understanding of the rite of Abrimalin, and thus of the work of this ritual on the human condition. This also gives insights into the purpose of evocation in a theurgical tradition. Not a book for dabblers or brousers, but for a serious student may be worth the work"
5,Wonderful purchase,"The picture for this item does not show the true beauty of the piece. This ring is one of the best I have ever purchased from Amazon! The ring far exceeded my expectation and will go perfectly with my dress for an upcoming elegant affair. The details of the metal is well crafted and the stones are made to look like an even more precious gem. Wonderful, wonderful piece!"
1,Embarrassing,"Missed attacks, cheesy music, and a blatty tone that sounds perpetually flat.Look. I actually play this instrument. The bassoon can be a beautifully expressive and, yes, even funky, instrument in the right hands. Do not think for an instant that Daniel Smiths' are the right hands.Instead, listen to Dag Jensen, or Klaus Thunemann, or Frank Morelli, or Masahito Tanaka, or David McGill, or Kim Walker, or Barak Stees, or Judith Leclair, or.. well, pretty much anybody who isn't Daniel Smith. Dag Jensen is my personal favorite.And for bassoon jazz, listen to Paul Hanson. He actually plays interesting music with a presentable tone."
2,Freaky Deaky,"It had to be done, I suppose. I'm not faulting the performance,but this made me want to fall on my knees and give thanks forAdolphe Sax."
5,BEST CELL PHONE HOLDER ON EARTH,I have had about 3 of these. not because they break but because they work great and i get them for family and they love them and ask me to get them for their friends
3,Consistent elegance & force,"The Isley brothers have been in this game for decades and the reason why their presence is still noticeable and influential is because they have got that rare talent and the elegance to deliver meaningful baby makin' music.Although I would have preferred much more involvement from the uncomparable R Kelly who's featured on the smooth ""Blast off"" 4.5/5, other tracks like ""You Help Me Write This Song"" 5/5, the 1st single ""Just came here to chill"" is a vey nice ballade similar to a babyface blueprint, you will also like ""You're my star"" which sounds like a kanye west production.Forever Makin is produced by Michael Cox, this must have been a leftover from Usher's album ""Confessions"" 4/5.Overall, this album is not really a classic but ever since Barry White passed away, the Isley brothers can claim to be the survivors in the baby makin' music style."
3,pretty good Isley's album,"i got this album way over a year back. ""Just came here to chill"" was a SMooth cut as Mr.Biggs aka ROnald Isley got his groove on. my cut though was the Winning track by R.Kelly, Blast Off. R. Kelly and Ronald Isley sound unstoppable together. the vocals and vibe of the song are tight. the rest of the album sounds like downlow meets the Big Popa era. but the standout stuff is tight and another winning collection in the Isley catelog."
1,A dull and painful read,"I had high hopes for this book. The subject matter promised to be fascinating and enlightening. After all no one really knows if Queen Elizabeth ever named James VI of Scotland her heir. Most accounts state that the dying Elizabeth when asked who she named as her heir simply raised her fingers over her head indicating James.I was really looking forward to reading Leanda de Lisle's account of Elizabeth's final days and how Mary Queen of Scot's son, James of Scotland, found himself crowned King of England. Unfortunately, this book bored me to tears and forced me to resort to skimming just to get through it. The book lacked organization. The author jumped from one topic to another and then back again. The writing was all over the place. If you're looking for a great source on James I's accession, look elsewhere. This book is a snooze."
3,Not as soft as says,"Many people have led me to believe this is the softest baby towel out there. I hope not because it is a little rough. It is big though, but not soft. Look elsewhere, not worth price at all."
3,low buck item,"This item cools great, but putting it together reveals a great deal of plastic and styrofoam. I sliced a big cut in my ear by hitting my head on housing, so be carefull. The chasis slides out which is counted as a plus, but I don't think it is when you consider that screwing the various parts onto the frame can be frustrating and the cheap plastic pieces are a disgrace. The air intake lever for fresh air was immovable against a styrofoam inside,this lever is very breakable as are many other parts including the snap on front cover which broke the first time I put it on. Replacement parts are probably becoming a big business for Panasonic. ..."
3,Very Sweet But Difficult to Act out,"I love the illustrations, I love the text, I just love this book. But. But I want to kiss my daughter in all of those sweet places while I am reading her the book and I can't because I have to hold the book in one hand and my daughter in the other and become a contortionist to kiss her bellybutton. And I wouldn't be able to do all of the kissing AND reading while my daughter is on the changing table. I guess I'll have to wait until she's in a big-girl bed. So it's not the author's fault, it's just that the book is better for, say, 18 months and up."
3,Very cute!,"I love this book but my 20 month old doesn't care for it. She isn't patient enough to wait for me to read and to give her kisses, she just wants to hurry and turn the page and then say ""all done"" and then she goes to find an interactive book, one that lets her move something or open a window. This one is cuter for parents not so much for the 2 second attention spanned toddler."
3,Counting Kisses,Book arrived with pop up pages stuck together. When my toddler tried to look under the pop up the page ripped because they were stuck together. Story is cute and has helped my son to stop biting and kiss instead.
3,"Cute premise, but in reality...","your mouth will dry up from giving endless kisses if you try to kiss your way through the book. I found that my child isn't interested in sitting for that many kisses. Besides, I don't want him to associate being annoyed with being kissed a zillion times. Not much of a story. It's more for the cuddle time."
4,Sweet Habit,This is a sweet little board book. It has become a great nightly ritual in our house. It would make a great shower gift for a new mom.
4,H hermits reviewed,"I got this for my daughter who is 28. She said she liked it a lot. Herman's hermits were big when i was a teeny/bopper, and then when my daughter was young, we introduced her to some of their hits.Thanks for the memories!!"
3,Peforms as promised,I use this with my SB800 for off camera flash. Works perfectly for off camera flash at weddings and/or location assignments.
1,Suction for snake bite is not recommended,"The Center for Disease Control and other medical authorities do NOT recommendsuction for snake bite. And I must say, the reviews here sound....)"
5,Good Overall,"I've used this type of extractor for years, it works well. Obvisouly it doesn't do squat for stings on knuckles or other awkward places, but for arms, legs, etc. it is great! Treat it well--I dropped my old one a few times and now the tip is cracked and won't work right, but that was several years of use in so no complaints! Excellent for bee stings and I've even had luck with mosquito bites."
3,limited uses,"I have not tried using this for snake bites, but it doesn't do much for blackheads. I wish I'd have saved my money on this one."
5,In every first aid kit,"Texas Water Safari lore tells of one redoubtable contestant who was bitten by moccasins on three separate occasions in as many days in this 250+ mile race, and persisted, with the aid of the snake bite kit, which is required equipment. Less heroic but just as compelling (and far more common), the relief to the parent of the bee-stung infant. Everywhere is something that hurts when it gets under your skin; and everywhere there should be one of these in your house or car first aid kit.Unfortunately does not work against teenagers or Republicans until they have actually bitten you."
4,complete idiots guide to freshwater aquarium,Ok book alot of good information. Would have hoped for more pictures of the fish the book describes in each chapter. Happy with the purchace.
3,The Cramps - 'Live At Napa State Mental Hospital' (NVD),"Nice archive performance from the original line-up of the band,meaning that we get to see buzz-guitarist Byron Gregory(R.I.P.)in action here.'Live At...' was filmed with a hand held video camera in black&white at the hospital in June,1978.Lux and Poison Ivy appear to be in good form.Some great Cramps tunes are here,like ""Mystery Plane"",""Human Fly"",""Twist And Shout"",""TV Set"" plus four more.But this DVD is just(is this right?)twenty minutes long!?I think I'll be patient and SEE if they ever reissue this DVD with extra tunes,which should've been done on this release in the first place.I mean,c'mon...twenty minutes?You'd better be a major Cramps fan before purchasing this DVD.Quality of both picture and sound are not great,but okay."
1,Cheap and see-through,"I bought this for my daughter. Even tho she is petite for her age, this costume was short on her. The material was thin and see through. As for Brands on Sale, they are the biggest rip-offs I've ever dealt with. They don't refund you in full which I think should be illegal. The costume was never worn and returned immediately upon receipt. Shop from anybody else but them."
3,"good story, very tiresome dramatic sound effects","The acting is great, the story is interesting but the constant overly dramatic background sound effects will give you a headache and detract from the episode."
1,Reruns from series 5 1993,"ACORN put these out in 2005 on the Classic Collection of Poirot. A great set for all Poirot fans. I prefer the ones you get from the UK in PAL. Then you get the series in the the order they are released. I have the latest series 11 and 12 and will get 13 when it is released in the UK. All you need is a DVD player that will accept any type DVD. Buyer beware, if you are a Poirot fan you are likely to have these in your collection. All available from Amazon which gets 5 stars..."
4,"Three Strikes, You're In!!!","The third in a line of successes for Take 6 was a blessing to my ears. Even though I thoroughly enjoy the a capella music of Take 6, they showed versatility with this musical endeavor. Sing songs with such greats as Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles and Queen Latifah definitely gave them an edge on the market. Biggest Part of Me took me back and showed true talent and Its Gonna Rain proved that they haven't lost the a capella touch."
2,Not the best booster...,"Honestly, there are way better boosters (i.e. Invasion of Chaos, Ancient Sanctuary, Rise of Destiny). Don't get me wrong about the pack, but it isn't that good. All the commons are useless, one rare is worth putting in (Pot of Greed) and others are holo (9). Soon we will be getting Dark Beginning 1, and this pack will be outdated, though some of the cards in this pack will cost more.Pros-First Booster!Cons-No good commons-Much better packs; better commons in those packs-Terrible rares (Pot of Greed is best)-Putting useless cards as holo.Rating:Commons: 0.00000000000000000000000000001/5Rares: 2/10 (Pot of Greed is the 2)Holos: 5 (Not reliable)"
2,"Good premise, but the delivery falls short.","It would have been a better story if there were more escapees, a more diverse group rather than just criminals. It seems like the boys didn't get much of a role, and Al and Lodgepoole did all of the work. The plot wasn't nearly as convolutedly awesome as it is in some of the other books in the series, and it was all just too flat and predictable. Maybe it's the switched author? I really don't know, but I miss the style of the other Eerie, Indiana books."
4,What abbystar thinks of EA Robinson,"Having read EA Robinson's poetry I find it slightly disturbing yet beautiful. I am not a person to enjoy works like Robert Cory which is aabout a nice white collar worker who kills himself. Not all people are like that. His mocking sing-songy rhythm insults people who are genuinely stable through and through and can control themselves with out the use of firearms.... And althought the message bothers me the way he flows the language is beautiful. It is not a sad beautiful, but a recognizable and realistic beautiful, it is strangely fulfilling even if he smacks you in the face with the ending. All in all his work is unique and I liked it."
5,Impressed,"I was hesitant to order this as it's not under Prime, but I got this faster than the other items that I bought with Prime. Impressive. The product seems of good quality."
5,Fabulous read,"This is not a book you'll curl up with in one afternoon. The writing is a bit technical and dry, so it's better read in increments.BUT... if you want to re-examine what you know about childbirth and breastfeeding, this book is rock solid. The book is straight-forward and factual. It will give you food for thought that you will digest over a long period.This book will affect you as a practitioner. I highly recommend it."
5,Airscape remix rocks!,"Okay, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the original version of this song. The lyrics and music are cute enough, sounding a little too similar to their previous, stronger hits, ""Boom Boom Boom Boom,"" and ""Up and Down."" But, you can throw the original version out the door after hearing the Airscape Remix. The Airscape Remix has taken many of the US clubs and radio shows by storm. The vocals have been completely removed out of this mix (good choice!) and is pretty much a variation on the chords and theme of the original song. The remix is a hands in the air, epic-trance anthem. There are huge trumpet builds and breakdowns that will tear up any party and make any person want to dance around. A very happy happy dance song (about 8 minutes in length) that is featured on DJ Skribble's Essential Dance 2000 CD (sadly, in an edited form) and should be sought out. Airscape, thank you for your teriffic talent!"
4,Just soars,"This is one of my husband's favorite series, so it seemed a fitting Christmas gift. We can't wait to start watching it."
2,Tape broke.,The correction tape broke in the dispenser. I can't use it. I'll try the 2nd dispenser and see what happens.
3,How old is the Content?,"Book appears to be about what I expected - except not sure how old is the content actually. The book has a copyright of 1999, while the Amazon web page lists a publishing date of 2006. Either I am not getting something here, or the web page is misleading."
4,Compelling reexamination of Pius XII,"The title of this book is a bit sensationalist: Cornwell never seriously argues that Pius XII believed in the Nazi cause. Rather, he claims that Pius XII failed to resist effectively, and did not speak out against the Holocaust. This much is undisputable, and it will be difficult for readers of this book to view the pope as a hero. My only complaint is that Cornwell doesn't spend enough time examining Pius's reasons for acting as he did: the pope claimed that he was worried about retaliation against the city of Rome. This is a plausible excuse, and makes Pius XII far more sympathetic that if one considers him a Nazi sympathizer. Cornwell should have done more work here."
2,Too biased,"I don't like this book because I think that it is bad research, and even worse targetting at misleading the masses. BTW I am not Catholic, so I have no interest or particular reason to defend Pius XII. The argumentation of the book is poor and the evidence very selective. Cornwell ignored the mass of evidence that sustained the contrary thesis, and the reasons that led Pius to use a soft policy for helping the Jews (Hitler reacting with more persecution when the pope would condemn antisemitism strongly, and Hitler's becoming full of hate just by hearing the word ""Jew"".) For those who are interested in a much better book on the same topic, I definitely recommend Pierre Blet's book on Pius XII. (Pius XII and the Second World War : According to the Archives of the Vatican)"
5,Revealing fascinating expose of Pope Pius XII,"John Cornwell who is a Catholic teacher, writes a fascinating biography on Pope Pius XII. John had access to many secret documents on this Pope and shows that he did nothing to help the Jews in WWII.I was schocked to discover that Pius XII never once condemned the nazis or Hitler during WWII. He also never once condemned the persecution and killing of the Jews by Hitler during WWII.This book is very well written and explores Pius XII's life in much detail.I recommend it highly to anyone who wishes to probe more deeply into the history of the popes."
1,Here come the laywers...,"I need not bother to explain all the ways in which Israel honored the Pope for his work on behalf of the jews... it has been said before.I just want to point out that books like these have a purpose.. they always come about 1 year before a shakedown attempt by the lawyers.Just watch, it will come."
1,This book is Crap,"This book is total crap.It proves one very hard and frightening maxim:those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.The world did not, would not act on the Nazi threat, and the second world war was the result of the world's cowardice.It is a cop out to place blame on the Pope Pius XII, or the Catholic Church. In fact, one of the main reasons the world,meaning,most of europe,England,the USA,did not act was the huge amounts of Nazi sympathizers in those countries. Now we are in a similar situation in the war on terror.What will be the result?"
4,A story that needs to be told,"Whatever one's misgivings about the author's conclusions, one thing of great value is his discussion of the Latin church's scandalous behaviour towards Orthodox Serbs...Even if the author has an animus towards the Latin church, enough important information makes it to the light of day to make this book worth reading. END"
3,"Absorbing, but not wholly convincing","Take two subjects of perennial interest - World War Two and the papacy - and combine them. You should be on to a winner. John Cornwell almost does it here - but not quite. To take the positive side first, the book is awesome in its detail and the apparent thoroughness of its research. The negative side is that this isn't a ""warts and all"" picture, but one that concentrates almost exclusively on the ""warts"". Hindsight is used far too often and John Cornwell makes the fatal mistake of judging one period by the standards of another. The picture of Pius XII that emerges to the reader who can pick his or her way through all this is one of a rather sad man whose priorities were in entirely the wrong order at a time when it was vitally important to have them right. I'm not sure that that's what John Cornwell intended."
3,A controversial book about a controversial person,"If the author's research is credible, and it certainly appears so, then an unfavorable opinion of the subject can be the only result of this work. While parts of the book may be difficult for those without an in-depth knowledge of the Roman Catholic Church, the author presents his case very well. On the whole, it is interesting and informative but it will not convince anyone who refuses to accept a negative opinion of Pius XII."
2,Unbelieveable Performance,"I purchased this CD to add to my collection of atrocious performances. I first heard it on my car radio, without knowing who the performers were. My immediate reaction was that Correa was playing with borrowed hands. Since I never got past his playing, I never drew a conclusion about Bobby McFerrin's performance."
2,Where's the music?,"Clevenger certainly plays the notes, but that's about it for this lackluster recording. Who cares about recording quality when what's being recorded is stagnant? The interpretation is subpar, even for Clevenger, with very little emotion, dynamic contrast, or movement, and, while I'm no expert, tempi seem chosen at random (i.e. not informed by historical research). This reminds me of the story of Dennis Brain reading a car magazine while recording Mozart K.495, except Brain still managed to put life and spunk into the music. Clevenger does not. I highly suggest the Lowell Greer, Radovan Vlatkovic, or Alan Civil recordings of the Mozart as astounding examples of what can be done with this music."
2,What has happened to liquid paper?,"Liquid paper was a fantastic product when it first appeared. This item is clumsy and difficult to use. Sometimes it applies itself (but not exactly where you want it. You have to be flexible!), and sometimes it just stays in the roller.The rollers do not move evenly, so with every application, one has to twist up the rollers to be even again. I will not buy this product again."
1,Plain did not work,"I tried this router out for a weeks period of time with dismal results. The router would frequently reboot on it's own. Over a 5 hour period of time the router rebooted 32 times. During a reboot all internet sessions that are active get dropped. So this means all files I had downloading would get interruption, I would get kicked out of instant messengers, and I'd be disconnected from xbox live. I contacted dlink tech support who acknowledge my problem and that they had heard other reports of this problem. However, they were not able to suggest a course of resolution."
3,Not a four pack!,"Seller is mis-labling this. Ordered ""Removable Cover-Up Tape Dispenser- 4-pk."" and received one tape dispenser. Their description says 1 item, that is one tape dispenser, not one four pack."
4,This book was sooooo good!,"Annie Lockwood travels back in time to save the man she loves, Strat.Strat is in an asylum when Annie finds him. In the end,Annie and Strat don't get to be together. I was sooo sad. This book was awesome! Parts of it were a little confusing. Characters popped in and out of the story. They seemed unimportant and sometimes made the book hard to follow. During most of the book, I was on the edge of my seat, eager to read on. I love the way Cooney writes her books and goes into such detail. I totally recommend this book!"
2,"Not fun, but remote is a good idea","We were looking for something that would entertain our newborn while we drove in the car. She gets very fussy in her carseat, but loves stimulation such as lights and movement. So, we thought this would do the trick. The songs are about 15 seconds, it sits on the infant's lap (so she has to look down to be entertained, which most newborns will not know to do), the lights that blinks go back for forth a few times so my newborn is entertained for all of 10 seconds. When she is older, I still don't think this toy would be interesting or stimulating enough for her to want to activate and play with. This also does not fit across the carrier or tray table. It's very small and inconvenient for strollers and carriers.The reason we gave it 2 stars is because the remote is a great idea while driving so you can activate it. We just need a better toy."
2,Totally Boring,"My son never played with this - not once. Even when I had the remote for it (which I have now lost),he was completely bored with it. It never captured his attention for more than a few seconds, and he was never able to activate it on his own. You actually have to push or kick pretty hard to get it to go on its own. I wouldn;t waste my money on this one again.... Although the remote idea is great, I wish it was available on other toys!"
2,Not worth it...,"I bought this toy for my 4 month old to occupy him on long car trips. It was SO annoying to attach to the car seat, and it didn't sit on his lap so he couldn't even see it. The music is annoying. One of the settings is for ""soothing"" music but it sounded the same as the non-soothing music to me. As for durable, forget about it. I had this toy for less than 3 months, with VERY limited usage, and now it doesn't work at all. I replaced the battery and it still doesn't work. It was a waste of money. I would have been better off just getting one of those toy bars."
2,It's ok,"I bought this toy to keep my 6 month old entertained in the car. She didn't seem interested in it except for the toy that was attached. Sometimes when you press the horn, it doesn't go off. Other times the slightest little nudge will set it off. Sometimes every bump I hit on the road would keep setting it off. It was a little anoying. Also there should be more of a variety of noises."
5,In love with this book!!!,"I laughed, I cried, I felt like I was in the story as it was happening. Annette Blair is a wonderful author and I cannot wait to read more of her books! Anything written by her is a must-read!"
1,Ugh...,"I am done reading books by this Author. I've read three books by Annette Blair and I disliked each more than the last... They always look so promising, but I find the same issues with each book:The characters are either insufferable playboys or helpless, needy females. The relationships between the characters are outlandish and for the most part the dialog is completely unbelievable.The plot is assuming and more often than not just boring. Things get so far off topic that you start to wonder if your still reading the same book. Or if the Author is going for the Most Outrageous Plot Award.The writing style and editing is terrible. *see abovePerhaps worst of all, these books always look so promising. I get my hopes up and look forward to an intersting book, only to end up disappointed again and again. So, I'm done. No more odious books by Ms. Blair for me!"
3,"Wonderful writing, patchy plotting and characterization","This writer is one to watch. Lovely writing (though the conversion to digital format could have used better editing), and her characters would have been more appealing if their backstory had been fleshed out a little better. Especially the hero. Neither hero nor heroine connect as the damaged people they are, which of course leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of rejection. This is a story where the heroes are rather improbably heroic and the villains are exceptionally villainous. But the writing covers a multitude of flaws. It is better than one often meets in this genre. She ends with a nice teaser of the follow-up story. It may be worth paying to read that one, though both stories have wild story lines!"
4,Intriguing Story,"Throughout the story, the reader wonders what Sabrina is hiding. What is she so afraid of? Who is the man watching the house? Who keeps breaking into the library? Where does Veronica come into all this? All comes out in the end, including a few surprises along the way."
4,Enigmatic,"Undeniable rogue is a splendid novel, it captured my interest and it was most enjoyable. This being my first novel by Annette Blair I now look forward to reading the rest of her work."
5,Liked it,Good story. Fast read. Drama . Action and sex. I look forward to more from this author.ThanksKitty Edica
3,Easy read,"I found this book to be easy to read, nice story. However, I tended to lose interest in it. Just wasn't riveting."
2,it was alright,"this book was just okay, the hero fell in love too quickly with the heroine. the story was not very believable"
5,Beautiful memories,"It was amazing, I owned this album on vinyl over 20 years ago and it was lost along the way when I moved to Europe in 1982. When I returned to Canada I searched for Mort's music. I finally found it at Amazom.com. When I put this the CD on, the words to all the songs came back to me as if I had just heard them yesterday. I guess they were still etched in my brain even after all this time. I guess that it what I would call universal appeal!"
4,Brady Bunch Movie Review,"If you are a big fan of the Brady Bunch, you will love this set of movies!!! That's why I had to purchase it. The Brady Bunch Movie and Sequel are funny spoofs of the original show. Growing Up Brady is a cool way of looking back at how things really were on the Brady set."
3,Good thermos but leaks ever so slightly,"This appears to be a well built, solidly made thermos. It does a great job in keeping my coffee hot. Even after over 5 hours, my coffee is still very hot. You can drink directly from this thermos, and it is comfortable to hold. The only issue I have with it is that I notice a drop or two of coffee on the outside of the bottle when I arrive at work with it. I do tighten it properly, so I'm wondering if the o-ring may have an issue. A disappointing thing to happen with a new purchase, but not the end of the world. I put this thermos inside a large ziplock bag to prevent any leakage into my bag on my commute to work. Clearly I should not have to do this. FWIW, I have another stainless 16 oz thermos that I bought to use to bring lunch to work. That one does not leak at all, but it does not do a great job in keeping foods either hot or cold. So I've encountered a issue with both of these purchases of Nissan products. Buyer beware."
4,Great thermos but won't fit under the Keurig machine,"There are many good reviews on this thermos. I just want to add that while it seems like a good solution for coffee on the go, I was unable to use it with my Keurig coffee maker and it won't fit under it. It's like 1/2 inch taller. It's also a little ""skinny"" and won't fit nicely in the traditional cupholders (stroller or in the car). I will have to keep on searching for the ideal coffee mug."
1,Is not leakproof,"This product was fine for the first few uses, but has steadily begun leaking. It has already cost me two ties with coffee leaks. I don't recommend it."
5,I love it,"It's great. I bought two bottles. One for my husband, One for my little son.I pour the hot water into the bottle in the morning, it keeps warm in the afternoon.I like it."
5,Excellent product.,This is a great product! It keeps the liquid hot for 8 hours or more. There is nothing else that even comes close. We have three of them.
2,Way too hard to clean,You have to take the whole cap apart to get it clean or it gets moldy. 5 pieces and your have to be a technician to take it apart without breaking it. You have to twist it very tight for it not to leak.
2,Very dissapointed,"I bought this on the rave reviews here at Amazon. I really like the look and feel of the Thermos, and it kept my coffee warm for hours. However it has a tendency to leak when drinking from it, at the connection where the screw-on lid meets the mug. The result is a mess and possible coffee on your shirt."
2,"Good Initially, Started to Leak after about 10 uses","This was a great product initially but after about 3 weeks of very infrequent use, it has started to leak. I believe the issue is within the lid and the hinging part of the lid. I did not abuse this product it just began to leak after about 10 uses. I hope it was just mine that was defective and not a common issue. I will no longer be using this product."
5,Excellent,This is a very nice product does exactly what it says it will. Left something in it overnight and it was still warm enough to drink. Excellent product. Thanks Thermos..
5,WOW!,"This is the most amazing item I've ever purchased online. My coffee stays hot for a minimum of 4 hrs. and is still warm 6 hrs. later, and that's even after taking it into a cold car with an air temperature of -15! I love the non-spill top. I would recommend this to anyone who takes coffee or tea to work."
5,Thermos Nissan,Great. Does exactly what it says it does and what I want it to do. Doesn't drip or leak and keeps coffee HOT. Highly recommend.
2,Broke in three months,Not up to the usual thermos quality. Too many thin plastic parts. Broken and won't seal three months after purchased.
1,It LEAKS!! Look at 1-star reviews,"Two things you need to know about this product. #1, it will keep your beverage hot/cold for hours. No question. #2, it leaks like crazy. I bought one of these a while ago, and when it started leaking I thought it was only my product, but then my coworker bought one (independently), and her's started leaking as well, in the exact same way. I'm convinced this is some kind of defect. Look at the 1-star reviews for people who have had a similar experience."
5,my 2 and 4 yr old girls love it,"This is awsome, my girls adore these dvd's so do I, I like the british accents too."
5,CLEBURNE Of The West,"This is a very good book. Patrick Cleburne is my favorite civil war general, and this volume gives a very even-handed discussion of his life, from Ireland to Franklin, Tenn. In particular, it gives considerable space to his growth as a leader. The discussions of Shiloh and Franklin are very good, and understandable. The book gives attention to the General's private life, especially his tragic engagement to Miss Tarleton. In depth but not dry or overwhelming, STONEWALL OF THE WESTis a great introduction to this Commander of the often overlooked western theater!"
4,Excellent depiction of a little-known Confederate general,"Although my hometown is named after Cleburne (Cleburne, Texas), I knew very little of the military genius and accomplishments of this man until I read this fascinating book. In his short life, Cleburne would not have been considered a great man, except for his accomplishments and reputation on the Civil War battlefield. Cleburne was bold, daring and resourceful when matching his soldiers against overwhelming Union forces in a number of battles. His strategic ability and devotion to his men earned him the legacy outlined in this book.The well-researched information included in this book brings to life the passion and dedication that this man brought to the South during this struggle. Although not the most notorious commander of the Civil War, Cleburne has rightfully earned his place in history as the ""Stonewall of the West""."
2,Worked well - when it worked,"It seemed to be a easy plug and play replacement for the IBM battery. However, after a month or so the laptop power management software was reporting that the battery would not charge. A new IBM battery fixed the problem. We are not sure if the battery was not taking a charge, or if some electronics within the battery was failing to properly report the charge state. Warrenty service shipped a replacement when I contacted them by e-mail. The replacement seems to be working at the moment (2 days after we got it.)"
3,Don't be an idiot,"Okay, a man's suit is worth well into the hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Don't try to save $5 by ruining your expensive garments. Yeah, I might toss my old wool blankets around in the dryer with these sheets. Maybe some wool socks, long underwear, and a couple of old sweaters. But when it comes to my wool Pendleton shirts & Brooks Brothers suits, or silk Aloha shirts, I don't mind spending a couple of dollars to protect my lifetime wardrobe investments."
2,Bad fragrance,"These do what they say on the box - freshen clothes and help remove wrinkles, but they leave fabrics with a very intense aroma. Some of the other brands work just as well and don't have as strong a fragrance."
2,Nice product. Would like a bag as well,"This is a nice product and I have been using this for a while with the bag I got with DRYEL. It is a little dificult to think about putting your ""DRY Cleaning"" into the open dryer......:)Update 12/09Later versions of this product seems to have started staining on a regular basis and we have stopped using it."
2,Looked really good at first,"Problem is that after a few days, the spots were back as if I never cleaned the couch. It took a lot of time to take off all the pillows, put each of them in the dryer and then back on only to have very shabby results. My dryer also had a ""film"" that came out of clothes after drying the pillows. I didn't like the smell either."
5,A wonderful money saving clothes cleaning product,"I have been using Dry Cleaaner's Secret for a number of years and it cleans and deodorizes clothing really well. I clean all clothing which cannot be tumble dried after washing (e.g.: line dry or dry flat, etc) unless instructions say do not dry clean, as well as dry clean only items. Instructions say one sheet will clean up to 4 items but I have done up to six or seven at times if the items are not too bulky. I have also dry cleaned pillows and a sleeping bag as well as a comforter. Of course you need an oversized dryer to do the extra large items (sleeping bag/comforter). All it takes is 20 minutes in your dryer on the permanent press cycle. Remove clothes promptly when done so they do not wrinkle from laying in the dryer."
5,Nice and easy,"Fantastic product .A portable XM satelite radio that has 5 hours of recording capability .It was extremely easy to set up and sign up for activation .Simple to use functions with remote.Car adapter with mounting hardware , base with charger , headphones and a built in transmitter to listen through any FM source."
2,"OK hike descriptions, but no trail maps","While the trip descriptions in this book are fine, there are, inexplicably, no maps of the trails. While there are maps showing where the hikes are located, the trails themselves are not mapped. So, one is forced to either buy a map from another source or just attempt to follow the description sketched out by the author. There is absolutely no reason not to have trail maps."
2,I'm shocked!,"I'm shocked by the lack of proofreading. It's easy enough to check how names are spelled, but instead of ""Kyle MacLachlan,"" Halperin comes out with ""Kyle McClaughlin"" (pg. 34). Instead of ""Rande Gerber,"" we get ""Randy Gerber"" (pg. 29). And WHO is ""Giorgio Ferrari""? Someone who dresses cars? (pg. 31) Could the author mean Gianfranco Ferre? Who knows. But when an author can't be bothered to check that he has names spelled correctly, I suspect the rest of his research is sloppy too. Very disappointing."
5,Nothing better when it comes to marinating...,"Steaks in this, is oh so good... Leaves steaks very juicy and tender... So glad I found this stuff..."
4,FABULOUS!,Brian never ceases to amaze me. This CD is has so many moods to groove by in it. His featured artists on various tracks blend with his fantastic keyboard skills. I have NEVER been disappointed by his style .
3,It's on Tonight by Brian Culbertson,This is my first Brian Culbertson CD. I had been hearing his music on a AOL radio station I listen to at work. He is quite good and when he comes to my area in the spring I will definately go see him in person.
5,"Brian at his BEST, Deserves Ten Stars","I've never doubted BC's talents even though some of us were sort of shocked by the mediocrity of his last album ""Come on Up""(Please Brian don't take it personal) I got the Cd after waiting anxiously for a week because the local distributor was still assessing the demand for the album, I am told. What I like about this album is that it suits every mood, I've been playing it every minute night and day , since I finally got it two days ago. This could go down as one of the best romantic album of all time. Gents invite your lady over, buy some quality cheese & biltong and wine, put ""Its On Tonight"" in your CD Player and her head will surely spin, take my advice it worked"
3,disappointed,"having previously bought Brian's music before and thoroughly enjoying his tremendous talent on the piano, I found this CD to be overly saturated with sexual overtones to a nauseating degree. It really isn't necessary to sink to that level when you're that talented."
3,for the sheer fun of it,"a fine re-telling of the robin hood story, via this 1950s british tv series. i had barely remembered it, but watching these tapes containing 4 episodes brings back happy memories.my main qualm with the collection is that they could have chosen a better representation, but i guess with lisencing rights et al that cant be held against them.you will be surprised at the sophisticated approach to the characters this series takes, and i think if if i had the opportunity to watch the sequential development of them, i would give this an extra star.p.s. take note of a *young* leo mckern in the cast."
5,"Great Accessory, if not a Must-Have for Rebel Series Cameras","This is a great accessory for rebel xt. not only you can insert 2 NB-2LH batteries into the grip, you can also put 6 AA batteries into it as well (include AA Battery adapter!) I got a pretty firm grip of the camera now, and it definitely feels much better, and also i would be more inclined to take vertical shots because of additional shutter designed for vertical shooting. it's 40% less than the Canon branded Grip, and i would get this again!"
3,No good for small hands.....,"I have had the Rebel XT for about 8 months now and one of the reasons I purchased it was because it was smaller and lighter than others. Unfortunately, adding the grip to it made it unwieldy for my small hands. Yes, for portrait shooting, it made shooting easier, however, I found that in landscape mode, I couldn't figure out what to do with my left hand. Also, the shutter button was extremely stiff to the point of being almost unusable. For someone with medium to large hands, this would be a valuable item, but not for me."
4,Help,"I am planning to get the grip for my 350Din preparation for my Europe trip. But i need one question answered, though. Can you mount your camera with the grip on you tripod? Isn't it too heavy if mouunted?Thank you for any comments regarding this matter from you guys!"
5,Opteka Battery Grip for Canon Rebel XT,"Could not believe the price. Order arrived in 2 days, without paying for fast shipping. Fits the camera just like the Canon grip. Everything works great. IMHO you can't go wrong with this unit."
4,gotta get,"If you are comparing this to actual Canon Battery Pack/Grip, and are worried it won't right or have some issues, don't! Works perfectly at a much better price than the Canon version, just doesn't say Canon.I only gave it 4 stars, cause the rubber grip on mine peels a little, I need to re-glue it (yes I am picky)."
1,Unstable at any price,"Received this grip today and it did not live up to the reviews of the other customers. The grip was unstable and only worked 50% of the time. If I did not hold the left side of the camera and grip together, the camera would switch off.I owned this grip for 8 hours and it could not even pass the stink test. It would be one thing if it worked for awhile and then quit, but it never worked from the get-go."
5,AWESOME!,"This was one of my favorite subject's my dd took this year. It's a complete program, has great follow questions at the end of each section and rather interesting case studies to test the user's understanding of that chapters information. While the case studies are all religiously based, that one uses the syllogisms to prove or disprove, the information presented in the chapters is religiously neutral. We did not need the answer key for this book.My dd took a class at a local homeschooling co-op that did use the DVD series, but she said she hated the professor's speaking- she counted that he said ""um"" 16 times in one section once and had long pauses. You can't use just the DVD series to teach the material, but it is my understanding that you can use just the text.This material is useful for students 7th grade and older."
3,Musicians music,Magnificent playing..however it is not harmonious listening..it is a brilliant demostration of super technique..a musicians CD.
3,Liquid Paper Smooth,"The product works reasonably well, but it is so viscus that it sometimes clumps.KEL"
1,Dont like it It just like it say IT dose waste your time,The audio book do not tell you anything that help with meditation It may have been good in its day.
3,Only thank you and sympathy,"It only covers two situations in detail; thank you and sympathy. They are, however, covered in detail, but I expected more situations to be addressed. Otherwise, well written full letter samples."
5,Geat work pants,I currently have about 5 or 6 pairs of these pants and they are awesome. They're great for work and stay fairly warm since they are thick. They are made of a tough material. They are comparable to Carhartt but a lot cheaper since they don't have that name stuck to them and last just as long if not longer.
5,"I'm writing about the song from the album ""Supernatural.""","It's a very charming song, worthy of its two Grammy victories, even though some of the other songs are good. I never knew that this CD single was one of remixes, so I might have to get this one soon. THE END."
3,"Adequate, but not excellent","Most of the 'advice' given is pretty common sense to a competitive college student. They pretty much skim over different parts of the application process, like writing essays and taking the LSAT's. It's probably better if you buy a specialized LSAT book or specialized essays book. But if you want an overall, general idea of how to get into law school, I suppose it's a good buy--just not great."
4,Excellent CD,"This is a great intro CD to Kirtan. The songs on this CD are beautiful. If you are looking for beautiful chants over rhthmic music, you will enjoy this CD."
2,wouldn't have bought it if I knew there's no subtitle at all,"Pieces of great performance, but without any introduction or explanation. Without subtitle, even a Chinese-speaker can barely understand what they're saying, so what are English speakers gonna do! Disappointing. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew."
4,Buy it just for the last track,"Worth getting just for the last track, John Williams's ""Olympic Spirit."" Wow! Williams's ""Olympic Fanfare"" and Miklos Rozsa's piece ""Parade of Charioteers from Ben-Hur"" are also very grand."
3,"Somehow, opinions on this Lonely Planet almost never matched my actual experience","I've been to French Polynesia using this LP. The guidebook was helpful (all places I've stayed in were found in LP). Contact information was correct and full. But somehow almost every emotion/opinion described in my LP never matched my own :) However, one would not invent a wheel by saying that French Polynesia is not a place where standard expectations for price/performance can be met."
2,FINALLY!,"I'll be first in line to get this one, but like the others, I think this was the worst season. Still such a good show - one of my all-time favorites! I just wish there were some extra features on the other seasons - I would have loved commentaries and outtakes. John Ritter was in some of the later episodes, and I would bet those outtakes were hilarious!"
4,I liked it,"I picked my copy up at the local Goodwill store. It's old and the exercisers wear outdated leotards. However the workout would be a good change of pace for many. The warm-up moves alone really worked the kinks out of my neck, shoulders and spine. A lot things in the tape reminded me of things I do in yoga class but with a fluid not bouncy movement built in. Some of the aerobic portion was too high impact for me so I had to modify. Overall this tape is mentally relaxing and gets you in touch with your body."
3,A Letdown!!!,"I heard so much about this book - I guess I had to be disappointed! For starters, it's from 1954, so that was a surprise. The copy I had originally sold for $9.95 - that's about how much I'd pay for it. Some of the historical quotes get a bit tedious, epsecially the ones in french. It's not a bad book, but I've seen better. The patterns included in the book are definately for the experienced sewer (getting the patterns to size can be a real pain) - but that's a standard with these books."
1,"Sadly, a waste of money","Far from being a complete guide, this book is a narrow, incomplete collection of old ideas and outdated techniques. If you tried any of this stuff, you would be lost in the dust. Also, it's so full of typos and poor grammar, it would not pass a simple English test."
3,Too original,"It's nice to hear these songs again but I was expecting them to be digitally remastered and the static cleaned up... On the other hand if you miss the sounds of the old 45's, then this is for you."
1,Should have previewed the songs before buying,"Yet another ""new recordings by the original artists"" compilation where the re-recordings are invariably vastly inferior to the original. Bleah. Luckily, I didn't pay a lot for it."
2,Mediocre,This latest album from luda is mediocre at best. The concept is pretty much the same as all his other albums. I like ludacris and im not hatin' but this album doesen't really have anything special. To be honest i used to look foward to his freestyles with 4 ize and he hasn't had one of those since word of mouf. This album lacks radio singles and after one listen it will just be another occupied pocket in the cd case. I would rate this album 4'th on my list. After red light district and before chicken and beer. Buy if you dare but don't expect to be blown away.
3,luda,"This cd is dissapointing not as good as it should be..Ludas best cd is still ""the red light district"" ..I was expecting a cd as good as that one but its not well maybe next time.."
1,Pitiful color guide,"This book is a compilation of recycled pictures and page after page of ugly color blocks. This book doesn't ""guide"" at all, it just disappoints. F-"
4,Very informative about the history and lives of bandmembers.,This book is a must for any true fans of Pearl Jam. It tells all about how they coped with changes and stuck together. This is a very good book and has great pictures.
1,"poor writing, poorer journalism","Nothing in this book that a Pearl Jam fan doesn't know, and for the new fan: many factual errors here. There's no thesis that the author tries to support with this material. A pointless read, yet so simplistic that it leaves you after you close the book."
4,Pioneer XM Tuner (GEX-P920XM),I just installed this product and it seems to be working fine but haven't had a real opportunity to road test it. I will say that the reception sensitivity is greatly enhanced by placing the antenna on the roof of the vehicle--I originally had it laying on the plastic dashboard. My son also installed the same unit and seems pleased with his as well. I would give it 5 stars but having not used it for more than a few days I hesitate to rate it that high.
5,"Great product, easy to install, no setup!","The Pioneer GEX-P920XM Satellite Tuner is a great unit. No more wires hanging down the dash and units plugged into the lighter jacks! The box was a bit larger than I expected it to be but still was able to hide it easily in the dash. There was plenty of cabling to run the box from just about any location in your vehicle. The instructions were clear and to the point. Over all, great product and I love the XM service."
5,Perfect!! Worth Every Penny!,"I bought this after being a lifelong SIRIUS subscriber. I bought an aftermarket Pioneer Unit and bought the Sirius kit (over $120) and it wouldn't work, returned and got a new one, also didn't work. I am glad it didn't. I would have had to deal with one line of text on the stations instead of full display with XM. I get the same channels that I wanted on Sirius with XM thanks to their merger. Do yourself a favor and buy it. It was so easy that even I was able to install it! Nothing to it. The wires are EXTREMELY long however, so I had to tape them in order to get them where I wanted them. The unit is HUGE but I was able to secure it in same area as the stereo."
4,Great Essays,"This is a really great collection of Annie Dillard's essays. if you like good writing, read this book. She has a creative and questioning view."
3,Not for everyone,"this book was on a recommended reading list for the Lay Leadership Institute classes I am involved in. It's an interesting read but it took me about half the book before I could really get in to it. The author writes as she experiences different things and you are kind of left up to your own thoughts as to how you would relate this to yourself, your life, and the comparisons between nature and how we relate our humaness to everything else. Maybe it was just a little too deep for me. I did get another of her books and perhaps after reading this new one, I might be able to appreciate this one more."
1,Heh?,"Well, Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' is a much better buy.Why is this person allowed to mess that legendary name?"
2,No results,I used the whole thing and saw no results. I'm 42 and this is the strength retinol that was recommended to me by a Dermatologist. May have better results with a different product with same strength retinol.
5,Best walking shoes for our 2 girls!,We always start with countless shoes then end up right back here. We did that with our older daughter and these shoes were the answer to every problem we could think of when it came to shoes. Her foot was also a bit wide and we were able to find these in (w). Our little one same thing--she's 15mos. We started off with shoes that were clearly hurting her foot and once I started noticing her big toe turning black/blue--it was time to come back to these shoes. She has long narrow feet. We have not had any problems since getting these. They are the best walking shoes. They can be worn with pretty much anything and they are very light so easy for them to walk in. My husband washed our older one's a few times when she was younger and they would look new. They lasted her way over a year--something hard to find with kids shoes. Will keep coming back to these...
1,A book that sounds and looks good But.....?????,"After reading it and beating an addiction. There are far better books out there. Miss Harrison means well, But She does not come from a good clear back ground of addiction recovery. Granted She beat her wieght loss problem. The Book looking at it from a LDS stand Point is border line false doctrine."
2,Disappointed,"I thought a ""NEW"" game would be more advanced or a little more challenging. It was just the same ol' same ol'."
1,TERRIBLE!!! RAZOR ...Don't use if you like your legs!,"I have used my venus razor since they 1st came on the market and I have always loved it, so when the breeze came out I was so excited to have the gel included. Well the 1st use was great, not problems except a lil slippery. The 2nd and 3rd use, gave me the worst razor burn I have ever had!!! THis razor is aweful and painful. I have written the company to tell them this too!! Do not waste your money and the health of your legs!"
2,BEAUTIFUL SHOE BUT OUCH!!!,"VERY ATTRACTIVE SHOE; HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO RUN SMALL. THE QUALITY IS COMPARABLE TO PAYLESS OR TARGET."
4,Warriors,"I thought that this was a very good book about the Vietnam War. It is definitely worth reading for those interested in learning about the reality of war for ground troops. It described well what life was like in a rifle company, what a commander's responsbilities were, and what a difficult experience it must have been. The author described the battle scenes very well and they were exciting (and scary), and in the Spring of 1968 they were pretty frequent as well. It was purely a description of life in the field and did not discuss the politics of the war. My only complaint is that the narrative was a bit too detached; I would have also liked to learn more about the actual thoughts and emotions that the author and his troops experienced during this time, about the war and each other."
3,Churchill,"This book gives an honest assessment and some times both sides of arguments of who Winston Churchill is. Part of my fascination with Churchill is his faults and Rubin displays them well. She doesn't analyze too much and gives a good layout of definitive actions by Churchill--who made him what he was. I know this isn't the first or the last book I will read about Churchill, but it did contain stuff I didn't know and I love random knowledge."
2,Surprisingly Bad,"I bought this book after hearing the author talk on C-Span ""Book Notes"". She seemed intelligent and well-spoken. I was surprised to find her writing was not up to her oratory. The book reminded me of term papers written by high school students- occasional flashes of insight, never properly developed, surrounded by uninspired verbiage. Chapters were subdivided into alternate views: ""Winston Churchill Was Well Suited to High Office"" and ""Winston Churchill Was Ill Suited to High Office"". After only a few paragraphs, the section would end with lines right out of high school debate class ""It was for these qualities that Churchill was hailed as the savior of his country,"" or ""Because of these qualities, Churchill was an irresponsible and erratic leader.""The only redeeming quality is the character of Churchill, that manages to still come through despite the very immature style of writing."
2,A very minimalist cover...,"I bought this cover to replace another one where I had lost the belt clip part. This one seemed from the pictures to be adequate but once receiving it I was a bit disappointed. I kept it since it was not worth the UPS postage to return it. The inside covers are complely clear plastic and the ""ends"" and ""edges"" of the phone are not protected by the leather part of the cover unlike the previous one I had. Also, the external display is not protected with a cover at all - the leather goes around it but there is no clear plastic to protect that normally exposed display. The clip is simply a slide on clip rather than a spring loaded clip that retains it tension. If you just need to secure this inside another pocket, purse, or belt pack, this is adequate. If you are active and want to insure that this stays on your belt, I would not recommend it."
4,Outstanding Overtures,"Rossini's Overtures are some of the most exuberant in all classical music, and the ""William Tell"" Overture, because of the Lone Ranger association, is probably one of the world's most recognizable tunes. This CD collects nine overtures performed by a variety of orchestras all for one low price. It is a fantastic value, no question. My reservation for not awarding a fifth star comes from the fact that the material is under the conduction of so many different people. I don't mind a couple of conductors and symphonies on a single release, but here it's like a ""greatest hits"" album as each overture is played by a different orchestra. While the sound and feel of the CD is generally consistent, there are subtle differences of style that bother me. I would unequivocally recommend Fritz Reiner's recordings as an alternate choice, however the drawback with that album is instead of nine overtures you only get six. With either choice, you're getting great music."
1,The book quality is terrible!,I bought it new but the quality is so terrible that I couldn't see description for any diagram or table.
2,Totem Pole Survey,"This book is mainly an anthology of totem poles found in the world. As such, it is rather dry and starved for content. It describes various poles with accompanying photos but does not venture much into technology, artform, etc. I can't really recommend the book unless you are a traveller wishing to visit and view various totem poles found in the Pacific Northwest."
1,Broke After 4 Months!,"One of the main folding joints snapped off after only moderate use over four months after installing it. Beware of this ladder! It is supposed to have a 300lb rating yet it broke while I(190 lbs) climbed it without carrying any other weight.AMAZON DOES NOT WARRANTY ANYTHING AFTER 30 DAYS! Warner (the manufacturer) wants me to uninstall the whole unit and send it to them at my expense for them to determine if they'll replace or repair THEIR manufacturing/design mistake.Another reason to support your local retailer, I guess. Any Amazon savings will be more than lost through the hassle and cost of sending the whole thing back to the manufacturer which is approximately half the original cost of the item. DO NOT BUY!"
1,No longer available,"Apparently the steel ladders, S2208 & S2210 had so many problems Werner no longer has them on their web site. The rail hinges on my S2210 ladder loosened up after only about 3 months use. Now, 15 months after I installed it, I called Werner to complain about the loose hinge joints. The CSR told me it sounded like my ladder had too many problems to even think about trying to fix them. He said it had manufacturing defects and to return the ladder to the seller for a replacement. He didn't hesitate one bit about saying to change it out, that they would take care of it with the seller. The replacement is the universal aluminum attic ladder.If you have one of the steel ones, and it has problems of any serious nature, don't hesitate to call Werner and complain. They'll probably authorize a replacement immediately."
4,Nothing Like a Steel Ladder to Stand the Test of Time,"I found the steel ladder to be much better than a wooden or the alumimum. Pretty easy to install, instructions could have been written better, I wish they would extend the maximum design ceiling height to 10'-6"". It would be a little difficult to extend the ladder if I was under 5'-9"" in height. This item doesn't ship well, but I go it replaced by Amazon without much fuss. Packaging inside and thickness of the cardboard box needs thicker."
4,A good product,"This weather statiom was easy to set up, the screen is very readable, and the remote sensor has a surprisingly long range. A very small screwdriver is needed for battery installation but this is a tool we have on hand. We are very satisfied with this product."
3,There are better models.,"The temerature is very accurate, but the other r=features are not. The weather feature is almost always wrong. And the atomic clock chooses the wrong time zone."
1,Don't buy this...stopped working within a week!,"This is the second one I've purchased. I love it when it works. The first one lasted about a year and stopped displaying the outside temp. The sending unit would display the outside temp but the receiving unit would not display the outside temp. I bought a second one and the range was about 10 feet, much to short of distance to be of any use. Now, after a week, the outside temp does not display on the inside unit but the outside sending unit does display the temp. Yes, I know how to reset it and make sure the channels are correctly set. Avoid this unit...you will be disappointed."
4,Weather forecast,I live abroad from USA. The product is very good but it seems is only developed for USA.
4,Works very well.,"I really enjoy this weather station. I put the remote on my shed under an overhang about 30' from the back door. The base unit is about 20' inside the back door with near line-of-sight. My original location for the base unit was about 15' further away with no line-of-sight and it would work sometimes but often lost signal from the remote. In this new position it works fine.It does take about a day to get the atomic clock signal, just be patient. The unit does read a bit high on these hot Texas afternoons, even though I placed the remote where it would be out of the sun in the late afternoon. But it's mostly accurate. The buttons on the back of the base for heat index, etc. are not very convenient, but I don't use them very often either. I like the bigger display so you can see both inside and outside readings without having to push a button. I also like having humidity reading from the remote - not available on the smaller models. Overall I'm very happy."
5,"Wodehouse is amazing, don't you know.","One of the early collections. The Jeeves stories are always the best to me. I began reading Wodehouse many years ago as a young boy and now with my Kindle I'm getting to enjoy him again, and at a great price.If you've never read any of Wodehouse's stories, don't miss these."
3,"Bad typography, look elsewhere",The Kindle Edition (B000JQUYBA) lacks proper curly quotes and has misplaced newlines. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a copy put together with more care.
2,Wooster and Pepper: who is the stupidest?,"The first three of these eight stories feature Bertie Wooster and his perfect gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves: Leave It to Jeeves, Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest, Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg. The next four are narrated by Reggie Pepper and neither Jeeves nor Bertie appear: Absent Treatment, Helping Freddie, Rallying Round Old George, and Doing Clarence a Bit of Good. The final story, The Aunt and the Sluggard, returns once again to Bertie's narration and Jeeves' genius.The stories ranged from mildly amusing to just plain silly. The male characters were not over-bright except for the servants, who were wily geniuses. The female characters were not only brainless but inconsistent; I particularly disliked the resolution of Absent Treatment. Unless you know you like this type of story passing for humor, skip it."
4,Relatively balanced business biography,"Murdoch is, to say the least, one of the more controversial figures in media today. His name still inspires visions of the pitched battles that have arisen around the pieces of his empire and the ethical debates about the role of journalism and issues of media ownership. There is a tremendous amount to be learned from studying Murdoch and the way he built his kingdom, and this book is not to be missed, particularly for people studying media history or the media industry.Shawcross presents a very balanced picture, light on both censure and praise, and manages to give enough personal detail to illuminate the public Murdoch without veering into a personal melodrama. The writing is occasionally a bit dry, but generally of a high quality & the source notes and bibliography are quite valuable in and of themselves."
5,"His mother says it's ""the best & fairest biography of Rupert""","Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert's mother indicated during an interview on the occasion of her 99th birthday [in 2009] that Shawcross' biography was indeed the best & fairest biography of son Rupert.A great read - I enjoyed it immensely - certainly provided insights into big business, government & the media written in a complelling 'no holds barred' style that demonstrated you can call a person a fool & worse & get away with it!"
4,"Good, Small Light","This thing's product image is a little bit misleading... this thing is pretty small. But that's quite alright, just dont expect it to replace an enormous 80w nightstand light!"
3,Could work better,"This brand works OK. It comes ""off track"" quite a bit and rubs off the paper. Not as easy to write on top of with pen as other brands."
5,The Beginning of Modern Infantry Tactics,"My son, a serving soldier in the National Guard, asked me for a good book on infantry tactics. I went right to the shelf, and pulled down this book.Rommel served on a variety of fronts during the First World War, and even fought his future Italian allies, a fact he loved to point out to them during the Second World War. His stories, assembled in this book, made him something of a military celebrity between the wars. The book shows the rise of ""fire and maneuver"" infantry tactics by squads, platoons, and companies. This was a major change from the tactics of the 19th century, where maneuver elements were more often battalions and regiments.If you watch the scene in the movie ""Patton"" where George S. Patton attributes his victory over the Germans to reading Rommel's book, this is the book he read."
3,Rommel infantry,Book arrived in great condition. It was a little hard to read at times and I am a big war buff. Lots of interesting facts and ideas. not a bad book just not great.
5,LEGENDARY PERFORMANCES,"These recordings are some of the finest examples of double reed performance bar none. You have recordings by some of Americas greatest double reed performers and one of the truest examples of the ""Philadelphia"" school of wind playing. The significance in this is that the American School of oboe performance comes from the Philadelphia school through Marcel Tabuteau, who was John de Lancie's teacher. When you hear de Lancie's unsurpassed and flawless artistry, you hear Tabuteau. Bernard Garfield is a true living ledgend and in my opinion there is no better recording of the Mozart Concerto or the Hungarian Rondo than his. His sound is pure, sweet, and without equal. His level of music making is such that you begin to forget that it is a bassoon that is singing to you and that it is something else all together transcending that. I would strongly urge all oboists, bassoonists, and lovers of fine music making, to purchase this CD. These recordings stand the test of time."
4,"Good Group, but Old","This group is a really great group and very talented. I think the first to CD where great! The last one was just ok. They have music simular to ALL 4 ONE, but I think ALL 4 ONE is a much better group."
4,"For B2Men standards, the album is a mix.","Following the wide success of II, their second album, it's hard to compete with such high standards. 4 Number 1 singles. For me, the album wasn't as fun as II. There are good songs, (4 Seasons...;Song for Mama;Human II) and some bad songs, (Never;All Night Long) but overall, I was impressed with the quality of the songs and I can never bad-mouth Boyz. It's excellent work."
3,PUFFY KILLED THIS ALBUM,"This album was fine ...until the talentless and iritating Sean ""Puffy"" Combs got a hold of producing some tracks. The Boyz should have known better than to change their winning production formula of Flyte Tyme (Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and LaFace (LA Reid and Babyface), who catapulted their career in their second album -- producing the classic ballads ""I'll Make Love to You,"" ""On Bended Knee,"" and ""Water Runs Dry."" These guys were on the road to the love ballad Hall of Fame, but With the sampling-dependent Puffy, they sounded flat. Puff don't know ballads (much less rap). Babyface-produced ""A Song for Mama"" will be a classic, but the rest of the album is hardly memorable. ""Doin Just Fine"" and ""Girl in the Life Magazine"" should have gotten more play. Hope they go back to the winning formula in their next album to salvage their career. And throw out Puffy and his sampling machines."
1,I havent got it yet,"I wish I could put a review on this product but i still havent got it yet. Could you please help me on that?Thanks,Mauricio"
1,all the wrong moves for me,"i've done lots of ballet and dancing and all kinds of other exercise, but most of the moves on this tape just don't feel 'right';also, there's absolutely no trace of dance on it, though it says so in the title;overall, quite a disappointment (not to mention instructor's annoying whispers);"
5,17th Century Music,I found this item to be very enjoyable. It is fun to listen to period music and listen for the difference between then and now. I enjoyed the variety of the CD.
3,Read It At The Library,This is A very good book... but it if your looking for help with grants and other things this is not the book for you.. its more of usful information for silly stuff...
2,Dulce and Boring!!!,Goddness I could not wait for it to be over it was extremely boring. I like adela noriega but she was so not her on this soap. It could be the age factor that she was really young on thi particular soap. I was not engaged at all on this soap. This is one of the boring soap that I have and would not watch again. It will be on my book stand for ever.
2,The visual and performance of this radio is very poor,"I bought this on New Years 2006 and I used it for 5 years already and the radio got static after one or two years. It lasts good on alkaline batteries but it doesn't indicate correctly like it does it in random.The battery cap could easily slide off and I have to put all my data in again. The radio isn't loud enough (but it has AVLS thats the good thing) when I go outside. Plus, this radio is uncomfortable to use. This radio comes with less presets only 5 FM and 5 AM. Come on, I need more presets Sony you could do better than that. Plus, the weak stations comes to another station that maybe strong enough for the real station. Also, it got thrown out in the trash because I got in trouble back in May because I wasnt where I was supposed to be after leaving the Saturday Academy. Look it was 5 years of use after the 2nd or 3rd year of use like I said the ears were static. I rate this radio poor (2 stars)."
5,fantastic,"This is a beautiful album. It reintroduced me to Talk Talk, and is one of my favorite albums in my collection of thousands. It's a great one for late at night with a glass of 18 year old mcallan's or some fine shishkaberry, whichever your poison. Highly recommended for aficionados of jazz and sparse, experimental music."
2,Enjoyed the first part,"I enjoyed the first part about her young life in Maine and her struggles to achieve despite such long odds. However, I did not enjoy the latter part of the book where she seems to be tooting her own horn about all the celebrities she knows. That seemed to be the consensus of my book club in Maine as well."
2,Outstanding Pictures .... too brief text,"The pictures in the bio of Alanis are outstanding, and may be worthy of purchase. However, the text is too brief - and the author melds facts about Alanis with his opinions about her work and life in a rather unsettling way. I don't think this account of Alanis's life should be given too much weight."
3,Good performance but doesn't support WPA2,"I've had this modem/router for nearly 5 years, and its performance is very good. It has had intermittent problems with maintaining signal which required ""rebooting"" (i.e. disconnecting the power) on some occasions, but for the most part it is very reliable. It is able to detect many other neighborhood networks - not that it matters, since all these networks are secured.My only complaint is that it only supports the inferior WEP encryption. WPA2 is not possible with this model."
1,ROUTER DIDN'T WORK!,"The title tells all; I got the router in the mail, hooked it up, and it failed to work. I've since hooked my old wireless router back up and am back online, writing this review. I hate it when I get ripped off!"
5,Great Music,I love the Statlers. The harmony is fantastic. Quality was as promised and arrived before scheduled. one of my favorites
2,"Important ideas, but a wanting text.","I found the book to be built too solidly on circumstantial and speculative evidence to be of much use. The entire narrative of the text is almost a hypothetical due to the lack of solid evidence, which is no fault of the author. Breslaw brings up some very important ideas regarding the culture that Tituba could have come from as well as the culture that she would have then been immersed in and how that culture would have viewed her and for what reasons. Parts of the monograph also seemed repetitive or having little to do with any of the main points that Breslaw was making, the majority of the 2nd chapter for instance. In short, the book is lacking as far as historical writing is concerned but full of ideas that are important to the Salem witch trials and therefore an important event in early America. There may just not be enough evidence in existence for this book to be done well."
2,English-Urdu dictionary,"I did not get exactly what I ordered. I got a different edition with Urdu to English, but it did not contain the English to Urdu section. I did not return it because the Urdu to English is what I usually use and the print quality was better than the edition I ordered. However I may have to reorder the combined edition in the future."
5,great white out,I love this white out! It comes out really smooth and you never waste any by having it get stuck on the paper dispenser. You can write over it with gel pen too!
5,Great read,Great 19th century romance. Love how the four book series incorporates the characters into each book. Quick and easy read.
4,The Rogues Club--2nd in the series,"An Unforgettable Rogue by Annette Blair is the story of Alexandra and Byrceson. Byrceson marries Alexandra his best friend since childhood and leaves after the wedding for battle. Everyone thinks he is dead and she is the process of remarry when he breaks up the wedding. This is sweet story of two very stubborn people trying to do the right thing. I off to read the rest of series An Undeniable Rogue (1) , An Unforgettable Rogue (2) An Unmistakable Rogue (3)and A Christmas Baby (3)."
4,lovely series,"The Rogues Club is a great read. I enjoy reading from this time period!!However, Im not a fan of waiting till the last chapter for it all to unfold, when you know whats going to happen in the first chapter. Aside from that, the story is lovely and heart warming!!!"
2,REPETITION...AT ITS WORST,Wow! This author took 3 pages of a story and stretched it into 318 pages by repeating it over and over and over again.
5,Mount Florida - in short,"You can tell if something's worth keeping an ear out for when it's difficult to define exactly what it is & why you like it... Needless to say, Mount Florida's STEALTH EP falls into both the above catagories whilst defying any existing musical buttonhole. Falling somewhere around ambient beats - but not really - these tracks stand up to close headphone examination as well as through loud-as-you-like speakers. Well worth it."
2,"Great Piece, Bad Performance","This is one amazing piece. However, the strings in this recording are almost always out of tune, something unexpected for members of the great Cleveland orchestra. Some of the wind playing is beautiful, but that does not make up for the general high-school orchestra sound of the ensemble."
5,Great!,"Great calculator. I've been using this same model at work for several years. Decided it was time to replace the one at home (different brand). It was a no brainer. In my opinion, the feel of the keys is just right, and I like the Tax Rate and Margin functions, as well as the Date and Time. The display is large, bright, and easy to read."
2,No Maysa!!,"Nice try, but it's just not Incognito without Maysa. The Incognito musicians are fantastic, but if you're looking for the true feel of the songs, or anticipating Maysa going even deeper into the waters, you will be sorely disappointed by her absence. Sorry guys."
1,Bait and switch -- wrong calculator!,"I believe that the Sharp Compet VX-2128R is no longer in production, so I was excited that this Amazon affiliated vendor had some left. Unfortunately, the calculator they sent was the VX-2128V, which is a different and cheaper (at least $10 less here on Amazon) calculator. Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the 2128V, but that's not what I was trying to buy, and the higher price compounds the error."
1,Finding your way without map or compasd,This book it terrible. The guy who wrote this book does not have a clue about navigation. He is in love with birds. Thats all the books about is him and his birds. Worst book i have ever read.
4,Met the requirements,"Not incredibly theoretical in nature, but met my needs as an ""applied"", hands-on, how to for the basics of an ESS program."
5,Wine and Roses CD Great,I've had this CD for over a year and it still remains one of my favorites. Truly well done.
3,I beg to differ....,"Clever stylistic technique (yes, ""Faulknerian""), and for the most part, an interesting story that draws in the reader. But it simply falls apart towards the end, as the often compelling examination of the characters' mindsets devolves into narrative confusion and pointlessness--and an utterly meaningless ending. The transition from realism to surrealism simply does not work. If this is, as others are saying, a picture of Israel, then the only conclusion I can draw is that the Jews are hopelessly dysfunctional, and only the Arabs are clear-headed. That may indeed be true, but I suspect that is not what the author wanted to say. Indeed, he appears to have been so carried away with his technique that he may have forgotten his purpose in writing the novel."
3,I'm not Scottish,The plot and the main characters are very interesting. My problem with this DVD set was mostly the production quality. Not being scottish i had trouble understanding some of the dialogue to begin with but the seemingly constant change in volume levels along with the background noise made hearing and understanding the conversations very difficult.. I am 60 yrs old and retired from a factory job so much of this could just be my hearing but i don't notice it on most of my DVDs. The stories themselves were most interesting and if you enjoy early television mysteries like Mission Impossible and the like then you should enjoy this DVD set. I am glad i purchased it but the much later version was for me more enjoyable and i doubt that i will be purchasing more of these early sets.

4,Great headphones for the price.,"These are great headphones with only one drawback.I like the design. The ability to convert from over-the-head to behind-the-head is a nice touch. As is the stroage pouch.Some people complain about the slightly shorter cable. But I found it just the right length when you have your player in a pants pocket.Now, the only drawback is the slightly boomy bass. Koss went a little too far in trying to accentuate the bass. I had to adjust the EQ settings to compensate for this. Still, it's a tiny bit too much bass for my tatse. I also tried the headphones while listening to CD's. The boominess was still present, so it's not tied to the MP3 format.But, I still recommend these headphones. With the exception of the bass response they sound as good as my $60 Grado SR60's."
2,"Good idea, poor quality","These headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds (like the phone ringing, baby crying, etc.) without difficulty. The problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvas-like material that, in my case, without extreme use, opened up in several places exposing the wires. Koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product, however it costs one third of the item's price plus shipping to send it back, and it will most likely have the same problem. Don't waste your money, get something else."
5,Great headphones!,"I love these headphones; they've got superb sound (particularly the bass region--I didn't know headphones were capable of this kind of bass!), they're very portable, inexpensive, and the accessories & features it comes with are great. They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads. I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus."
1,Would be good.. if it worked,"I bought these headphones about 4 months ago. I liked them but didn't find that much of a difference with the sound quality. Also the folding headband function didn't work that well, the thing kept falling off of the back of my head. Then a few weeks ago the real problems started. The headphones would start only working out of only one side, I would spend twenty seconds twisting the jack, trying to fix just to have it stop working again as soon as I moved. Then the headphones stopped working altogether. My reccomendation, take your 25 dollars and by some quality headphones instead of these ones"
4,Awesome Sound & Pretty Good Fit,I bought these on sale and took a chance after reading some reviews on them. They really sound great for their size. My main headphones are a set of Grado SR-60 which sound amazing but these sound very close.The headband is adjustable. The fit is good if you use the band over your head. The behind the head use seems to not fit too comfortably for me and when I put it on that way the bad ripped a hair out of my head.I use these with my 40GB Fourth Generation iPod. They have a lifetime warranty and I use my headphones for working out and go through a new pair every 6 months. Save your receipt!They can sound a little bassy but I like that in a work out headphone especially since iPods really lack good bass. Excellent for almost any kind of music except classical.
2,Great sound. The wiring shorts out after a three months.,"There is something wrong with the plug on these headphones. After a couple of months there is a short in the wire that connects to the plug, I have had to pay to $6 to have Koss replace them twice. After owning three pairs, all with the same problem, there is apparently a factory defect. Do yourself a favor and buy the Koss Portapros instead, still going strong after four years."
1,"Bad design, clunky.....looks better than it works",My biggest complaints are:The ladder feels very spongy while climbing. I would never weight test it near 300 lbs.When pulling the ladder down it's very awkward and has a tendancy to spring back up when you are pulling the last fold of the ladder down. Hasn't hurt me yet....give it time and it might give me a good whack.buy the tried and true aluminum ladder without struts.
3,"Broke, but customer service was very good","OK, bought this ladder about 3 years ago & have used it about once a week since (occasionally multiple times). The hinge on the lower section broke (which appears common now that I look at the reviews). I checked Werner's site to see what kind of warranty they had & there is none, however, there is mention of ""standing behind their products"". So, I call them up & they were very understanding. After getting a bit of information, a replacement was on it's way. It only took a couple days to arrive too. So, on one hand, I'm disappointed that it broke & I have to replace it. On the other hand, I'm glad that I bought from an honorable company."
1,Absolutely Awful !!!! A disgrace!,"I am a diehard JAckie Chan fan; I love his modern movies. This package is a complete rip off. He is barely in any of them! They have even added ""Starring Jackie Chan"" at the beginning of one, and he is only in it a little while! There is endless stabbing and killing of women, and a scene of water-boarding. I am going to throw these DVDs away, and complain to my local grocery store where I bought them!"
2,Not the greatest,I am a major Feehan fan and looked forward to the new book. I ran out the first day and bought it...only to be disappointed. The story line was somewhat interesting but did not grab my attention. The characters lacked depth and had sparse details on how they came to be. I enjoy her other books and will continue to read her but this was a major let down.
4,A GOOD BUT NOT A GREAT READ!,"Okay,i jsut finished reading this book. i was a bit dissapointed that it didn't live up to the LAIR OF THE LION and the ""The Awakening"" in the anthology ""FANTASY"". it was very confusing. especially when she started a chapter, with the relationship progressing further than what was just said.I had to go back and see if i missed any pages or maybe i got a defective copy. i just didn't feel the depth of the hero and his heroine.Other that and a few other quirks,it was an enjoyable read.i won't say not to buy but i think it could wait until someone else bought the book so that you can borrow, so you don't spend the money."
4,"Thomas and Beyond Made Easy... Well, Almost","The authors wrote a very insightful book on the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. It is meant to be an introduction to his work but do not be fooled. It is not light reading so I would advise the reader to take their time and read it in ""chunks."" It appears to be written in a prayerful spirit and their insights are so beautiful that it may cause the reader to pause and pray themselves. Hopefully, it will lead the reader to study St. Thomas further and directly. One would do well to also read the small book by Jean-Pierre Torrel,O.P. entitled ""Aquinas's Summa: Background, Structure, and Reception.""However, in my opinion, I believe the authors are not merely presenting an introduction to the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. They are also sharing their interpretation and development of some of his thought. This is not a bad thing; in fact, it is a good thing but it is difficult to discern which is St. Thomas and which is the authors' development."
2,DECORATIVE ONLY,"I bought this to be a decoration and to be used, but since it it made of lava rock it seems to ""shed"" bits of itself constantly to the point where bits of rock are in everything that you might want to crush. Buy this only as a curio it is not functional"
4,STARFIGHTER,"Despite the fact that for many people F-104 is a controversial aircraft, I love it, so I wanted a comprehensive book about it.I believe that this book met my expectations in a lot of respects.The only drawback and in respect to its service in foreign airforces it does not have many information about certain users. For example the chapter concerning Greek Air Force (HAF) is very poor.Overall i recomend this book"
2,"Not enough volume, not bright enough.","This product would be fine for a small to medium size one room office. We purchased it for a larger room with a lot of background noise (commercial kitchen). It is neither loud enough, nor bright enough. This is for a small application only. Very disappointed."
4,Does what it needs to do,I am neither deaf nor hard-of-hearing.I share an floor with Psychologists and the last thing I want to do is disturb them with my business telephone ringing. This was the PERFECT solution. I have not yet gotten used to associating the light with the telephone (sometimes I just stare until my brain wakes up) but it works as advertised. My only complaint is that it is a little large.
4,Handy adding machine,"This is a handy adding machine as it can be used with the included power cord or with batteries. It is smaller than a standard adding machine so takes up less space on the desk. I am used to entering the numbers by feel rather than looking, and find I can do that with this small machine EXCEPT for the minus (-) key--I just can't get used to the location crowded between the plus (+) key and the change sign (+/-) key. Other than that it seems to be a fine machine."
1,NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS,"im not going to write a long review on this. i've had mine for about 6 month now and it has broken down 3 times!! everything was coverd under warrenty but each time i have to ship it back,it takes about a month to get back. imagin having to re-enter your shows...three times..not having a dvr for a month 3 times. i had a tivo before...now i kick my self for not buying another one when they still had the life time subscriptions."
1,"Died after 2 months, then a week after having it fixed...","If it worked for more than 2 months it would be a decent product. But it didn't. Then after having it repaired under warranty (I had to pay for shipping) it started locking up and losing the input signal within a week after getting it back. The 800 number is now a toll number (probably because they were getting so many calls it was costing them a fortune to keep the 800 number). Stay far, far away from ReplayTV."
1,If you are thinking of buying a ReplayTV....DON'T!!!,"I was really happy with my ReplayTV for the first six months. It worked perfectly. Then we had an electrical storm with a power outage and the ReplayTV would not come back on.Called ReplayTV technical support and paid $35 plus shipping for a replacement. The replacement was a refurbished piece of junk. It would repeatedly freeze up and lock up.Called technical support again, unplugged all the cables and plugged them back in, did a factory default restore and a software upgrade, and it still didn't work. Sent it back for ReplayTV #3.The replacement's replacement was another refurbished piece of junk. This one skips and repeats and gets pixelated during live TV. I am cancelling my subscription. What a waste of money. Please save yourself the trouble and DON'T BUY A REPLAYTV!"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Buyer Beware!!!!","Do NOT buy these products! We are on our second replacement unit because the fans keeps burning out. They were good to replace the first unit after 2 months but the replacement units are refurbished units! Which is probably why our replacement unit was defective. The technical staff are never available and often cannot help. There is NO toll free tech line despite the information that comes with the book. We spent 3 hours with a level 2 tech and we still do not have a unit that works. The call alone cost us $68.90!!! A nice unit when it worked, but that was not often. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Bad Quality - Bad Service,I am waiting for them to send me my fourth ReplayTV unit. The first one was DOA. The second developed a problem in one week. The third lasted a few months. They received the unit over a month ago and still have not shipped the replacement. Check out the BBB of Silicon Valley. They rate them as unsatifactory due to non-response to consumer complaints.
5,Lots of Fun!,"The music on this CD is energetic and energizing, with an infectious happiness sure to put anyone in a great mood."
5,GIVE US A BREAK,"I would love to give them a break, what great happy russian music,I own over a hundred russian cd's and albums and this is by far the happiest, you can not just sit and listen, you must get up and dance, thanks guys keep up the good work!!"
1,Poor Picture Quality,"The Hatachi 36UX59B picture is poor. The 750 lines of resolution you can count each one of them, it makes the picture blurred. I sent the unit back."
2,Falls apart very easily,The center part is like a cardboard box and once the cat gets its claws on it it will destroy it in a few seconds then you can buy a new replacement and keep spending money or leave a hole in the middle wich makes your cat not like the toy anymore.
3,Fun Toy for Some,"I have seen a couple of my cats enjoy themselves as they play with this toy, and I think I've seen all of them use the scratch pad. Only drawback, and this could just be a behavior problem of my cat, but he seems very attracted to using the cardboard as a pee collector. If it were not for that, I would keep it out all the time. Unfortunately, even when I removed the cardboard and washed it, the cat was still attracted to using it as a bathroom. I guess the plastic absorbed the odor. I'm not sure if all cats react the same way to cardboard. But after seeing the delight on my cat's face, I bought one for my sister's cat.Note: Later, I bought the style without the center, that looked like a crib toy. That went over well, except that it came apart and I had to use duck tape to keep it together."
2,Cat just doesn't care about it,My cat is not interested in this toy. He plays with it only once a week for no more than 10 minutes.
3,Cats use the scratcher.,"I received the blue one and at first the cats played with it but after a while the ball lost it's novelty and so they almost never play with it anymore, but they do use the scratch pad almost daily so it was worth the purchase. I can sometimes spark their re-interest in the toy if I sit there and spin the ball around the track several times. But usually, they get bored with it pretty quickly. Your results will vary. I have a friend who said his cats loved it and played with it so much that he had to put it out of reach at night or his cats would keep him from sleeping. On a rare occasion I will see my cats batting the ball around the track."
5,Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy,"My cat has one and I bought it for my daughters cat, who loves it. She plays with it a lot."
4,toy not scratcher,My kitty likes playing with the ball and makes the toy screech on the ground. She doesn't use the scratching area of it which is the main reason I purchased the item in the first place.
4,My cat loves it,My cat loves this scratcher. He'll use it over any others I have in the room. I just wish I could pick another color.
5,This is a must have for any cat!,I`m really surprised that some report their cats have no interest. I`ve always had multiple cats and so I have a number of these scattered around the house. One of my cats loves to play with two at a time. He hits one and then the other and rolls over to the first and back to the second keeping both balls going at the same time. I always recommend this to new cat owners who are looking for toys and scratching devices. It`s a must have!
2,cats not interested,"This toy did not do it for any of my three cats. It just sat on the floor, totally ignored, for several months until I threw out. They didn't even use the scratch thing in the middle, and usually they like that type of corrigated cardboard."
2,Cat is bored with it,"The first day it arrived my cat loved it and played with it for about an hour. We've now had it for couple of months and he barely looks at it. Disappointing, I have yet to find an entertaining cat toy."
5,"Great toy, frequently used","Purchased this toy from a local pet store. Great buy. Our kitten loves to play with the toy and she uses the scratch pad in the middle fairly frequently. It's the perfect toy to keep her occupied when she is by herself. It also provides her good exercise, as she likes to get the ball with a running attack. She has not lost interest after a month and a half. We had to remove the toy from the bedroom because the sound of the ball rolling in the track would wake us up at 3AM. Most valuable cat toy so far."
5,Mabel loves it!,"My 16 lb 3 yr old calico named Mabel is ""special"". She's a very outgoing, yet skiddish, little girl who will give you a good head-butt if you get close enough.She plays with everything but her toys. Twist ties, pens, straws.But she LOVES this thing! she will try to get that ball out for a while, then walk away mad. She walks by and randomly kicks the ball. She sits in the middle and scratches until I give her treats.Mabel would give it 10 stars!"
3,Disappointed; No-go for the Kitties,"I've seen my brother's cats go crazy for this toy, so my boyfriend got one for my two kitties. Unfortunately they showed very little interest in it. The kitten couldn't care less. The older cat likes it...as a seat. She likes to lay on top of it, and will occasionally bat at the ball, but doesn't it doesn't last more than 30 seconds. It's okay, but I'm not a fan of the cardboard insert, and neither are the cats. It's well made and I've seen other cats enjoy this type of toy...just not mine."
5,cheap fun for the kitties,"It took several months for the cat to notice it, but now he sits on the cardboard portion and whacks the ball around. This is a great, simple product that provides some entertainment for housebound cats. The big bonus with this is that the ball is confined to the slot and therefore will not get lost under furniture. If you have cats, you have nothing to lose by buying this."
4,cats like their new toy,"The 2 cats tried the scratcher right away, needed demonstration of pushing the ball around. Now they will play with it by themself."
4,My cat likes it,"My cat likes it. Definitely a fun toy.Tip: Don't keep it in your room at night, it's really loud when the balls spins around."
5,Old Tripod Kitty ...,... loves this thing. :) What a joy to watch him have fun batting a ball that he can keep batting. And he loves the scratcher.5 stars on his behalf.
4,"Indoor kitten loves this, outdoor adult sees it as pointless","This toy is a total hit with my five-month-old kitten who has never been outside. She will play with it night and day. It is noisy, so don't put it in your bedroom. It seems indestructible. She is not obsessed with it, but returns weekly to play for 30-45 minutes. My nine-year-old indoor/outdoor tom could care less about this toy. If you have a sophisticated, cynical and intelligent cat who has tasted the great outdoors, this is a total waste of money."
1,complete waste of money for MY cat,I bought this after reading the glowing reviews here. My cat did not have the slightest interest in it from the beginning so it's going to the Thrift shop.
3,great at first..........,Callie loved it !!!!!! But she managed to get the ball out and we we not found the ball since.
2,Super Cat or Defective Product?,"I just received this cute toy however my cat has already managed to remove the ball from the ring. I didnt think the ball could be removed by a cat, but it was. I do not own a lion, tiger or cheetah. I own a regular house cat. My question is, do I own a Super Cat or is the product I received defective?"
3,Most of my ferals wont touch it,"I take care of 5-6 semi-feral cats and I bought this because of the good reviews.2 of the youngest, but still not kittens, have batted the ball around occasionally but none, and I mean NOT ONE will scratch at the center thing.Ive tried putting them down on it. putting their paws on it but they wont scratch.Instead, they scratch the sofa.Yes, I put the catnip on it.Appreciate any suggestions."
2,Just okay,"My 4 month old kitten bats at it and plays a little with it, but he prefers the 4' cloth tube (he loves that) and small mice with shaky things inside, as well as a bunch of browhn crinkly paper stacked up in a corner - he runs and jumps into it and when he turns to walk away, the brown paper makes a sound and he jumps back in - the cheapest cat toy ever. Every cat/kitten is different, but this just bores my kitten. He likes to bite and claw his prey and this does not satisfy that craving. He has NEVER touched the scratcher either and he is a horizontal scratcher. He prefers carpet, rugs and uses a flat mat scratcher I bought for him. I guess you just have to get to know what your cat likes first."
2,Cat Couldn't Care Less,"My cat means business when he's playing. He will jump 5 feet in the air, grab the toy with his paws and shove it in his mouth before he hits the ground. And once it's in his mouth, pulling it out is a tug of war accompanied by growling and glares. He does not mess around. I've always thought it was a good thing for local wildlife that he's an indoor cat.If that sounds like your cat, then he probably won't be interested in plastic ball rolling in a predictable path. My cat scratched it a couple of times, batted at the ball a little, and then walked away in search of more challenging, erratic prey. But overall quality is good."
3,Our cats use the scratcher..Rarely the ball toy,"Our 2 cats Nemo- 1 yr. and Jordan 4 months....aren't too impressed. They have another ball toy similar to this product tho which doesn't run in a circle. Nemo uses the scratcher and Jordan will sometimes play with the ball..... ""sometimes"" however....She has other favorite toys ahead of this however. It's going to be a hit or miss for your cats, and with ours it was in between. I am just happy that every few days the ball gets swapped once and the scratcher is used. Overall for our cats, they think its a scratcher and it is used as one ..a toy not so much with Nemo, but Jordan plays with it if I push the ball around, but then again she plays with a piece of paper on the floor. I consider this a good buy for it's scratching qualities however...most scratchers run at the same price, and if you don't mind the looks of it, then this is a good buy. ..Maybe your cat will like the toy also."
3,"Does what it is intended to do, but my cats couldn't care less","I bought this because a friend's cat LOVES this thing and plays with it all the time.My cats watched me play with the darn thing and basically shrugged their shoulders and walked away. I sprinkled cat nip on it, and they came over, rubbed all over it and then walked away.My cats love feather toys, foam balls, and boxes. Anything else I seem to bring home is underwhelming.Giving this three stars because it works perfectly as intended, but wanted to show that my cat wasn't a fan so like any cat toy there is risk involved.I'm donating this to the local cat shelter and hoping that their cats will love it more than mine did."
5,well worth it!,"Got this toy for my cat about a year ago. He still loves to play with it and he plays with it every single day. The middle scratching part does come apart after a while, but I was pleased to see that you can get replacements, which easily click right into the toy. I got him a new replacement scratcher today and put a little catnip on it, knocked it into the holes, and he is in heaven playing with it again. It may seem a little pricey for a cat toy, but it is well worth it."
3,"Good mystery, lacks good romance","This is a romantic suspense that had a good mystery but the romance part didn't gel for me. It's about a wealthy female author who gets threatening mail and ends up with a bodyguard, Mac, to keep her safe. The history of their relationship was never really divulged in great enough detail. I kept feeling like they knew more than I did. If Caitlin cried one more tme in the book, I thought I'd scream! However, while it was fairly obvious who the killer was and the reader could see the set up at the end, there was a good twist that redeemed it."
4,Strange-ly original.,You would think this kind of comedy has been played out to death in recent movies but somehow this movies feels like it has some originality. The line up is great i mean Steve Zhan And Jonah hill are really just comedic greats. This movie was annoying at times but overall i laughed enough to say its well worth my time spent watching it. And my one dollar i spent to rent it. It will give u a laugh for sure but thats about it. Don't expect a whole lot out of this one.
2,Jonah Hill WTF!,"Steve zahns pretty funny in this movie but everyone else is just so so. And Id have to say Jonah Hill playing a hillybilly slack-jaw was not the best idea, he didnt have one funny line in the whole movie. Hes better at playing himself then some cheap gimmick."
3,"BRAINLESS, BUT ENTERTAINING!","OK, if you saw the trailer for this film many months ago you knew what to expect, I know I did. The film lived up to my expectation and kept me entertained through most of it's hour and 24 minute length.With a cast this good at ""dumb dumb"" comedies, it would be hard to believe they couldn't pull it off. If your in the mood for this sort of thing 'Strange Wilderness' will deliver somewhat.The voice over stuff is the best, but there are several laugh out loud moments in this silly and harmless film."
5,radius tooth brush,this is by far the best toothbrush I have ever used. I love the way it conditions my gums while I brush and it really does clean my teeth. No electric brush can match it.
3,"GI General is good, but as a memoir not history","A well written account of high command in the Med and Eurpoe during the Second World War, but biased towards the writer. This book serves better as memoir because of the way Bradley puts his his version of events.The battle of the Falaise gap and the Ardennes offensive are points to consider. Bradley lauds the pedestrian Courtney Hodges but derides Patton who admittedly had his faults and for his actions was treated accordingly."
1,"Terrible, rushed, perfunctory performances with altered orchestrations.","These recordings are ALL WRONG. The music is pushed and rushed, with Salonen's typical efficiency, but he doesn't let the music or the orchestra BREATHE. Listen to Herrmann conducting this same music and it's VERY clear. Also, in the Torn Curtain cut, the orchestration has been altered, due to the producer being CHEAP. Originally, Herrmann called for NINE trombones, grouped in threes, one open, the other two muted with different mutes, straight and mega. The idea was to produce a kaleidoscopic vamp of three trombone chords of different colors. THIS IS NOT ON THIS RECORDING. The only place to hear it is on the original soundtrack.Don't waste your money on this. The Taxi Driver music is so sexless it's pathetic. UGH... This is the worst recording of Herrmann's music I own... and I have the SACD...Stick with the original composer-directed recordings."
4,Had the editor been born,"DearAMAZON.COMLadies and gentlemen:Last week I received The Book of 101 Opera Librettos. I have some DVD's containing operas like Ada but without subtitles in the original language, Italian. I am a Spanish speaker and know a little Italian, but very little, and therefore I need the English translation . So I started reading this opera by Verdi. First of all the translator thought it was his duty to write the text again. In some parts he strays too far from the original which makes the meaning of the Italian words harder to understand. But the real problem is the spelling mistakes in the Italian text. I had never seen so many printing or spelling mistakes in such little space. Had the editor and the publisher of this book been born in Aida's time, they would have been beheaded, or confined to die in the same place with Aida and Radames.Anyway the book has been very useful and I do not regret the purchase. Thanks a lot.Alvaro BoteroManizalesColombia"
1,Inaccurate and Unpredictable,"This instrument is a joke. It comes with a base and a remote sensor unit (temp only) and the accuracy of the temp readings is way off. The remote sensor reports temps consistently 2 - 6 degrees too high and neither the base or the remote can be calibrated sooooo you're just stuck with an inaccurate instrument. Even set side-by-side, the temp readings from the base differ from the readings of the remote sensor by 2 - 4 degrees!The instructions are some of the worse I have ever encountered. The website offers no additional help at all. The radio communication between the remote sensor and the base is poor and unreliable. The lag time between actual ambient temp and sensor readings can be upwards of 10 - 20 minutes! So if you are watching for rain changing to ice or snow be aware that the displayed temp is perhaps twenty minutes behind reporting the actual temperature.Overall, an inaccurate and unreliable instrument good for - what? A pathetic rip-off!"
5,Rose legacy,"This story gives you hope in love, perseverance, and shows you can put your life in God's very capable hands. The characters draw you into their very souls."
5,Fantastic Recipes!,I too gave my first copy away to a friend and now am back to get my own. The cresent roll rings are in itself a huge hit for guests! The spiral binding is more helpful as it keeps you on the right page without turning.
3,"OK, but really lacks the depth to be informative.","If you're looking for a general outline of federal employment laws, I would suggest this book. Overall, a quick read, but the use of common law abbreviations and inconsistant reference to what they actually stand for made it a little harder to follow.However, if you are looking for some detailed information that is written without the ""sometimes, however"" and ""some states"" vagueness that can make you ask yourself why you purchased this book, then I would suggest picking another source for workplace law."
5,Must have for North Anerican riders!!,"Great book outlining various ripping locations across North America. A bit outdated as it was published a decade ago, but def has its relevant points that are still valid. I still pull it off the shelf every time I plan a trip. It's very well laid out, organized, and to the point info. It even caters to all types of riding, pointing out the ropes from novice areas to the best spots to find the pow for those advanced riders. No riders handbook would be complete w/o a section on the night life. Once again, a must have for the rider who likes to explore the resorts around North America... or Europe in the European edition."
3,Okay book but no depth,"I enjoyed this author as a child because she usually has some unexpected plot twists in her books. Not this one. It was very predictable and had little of the uniqueness of the other two books in this trilogy of ESP kids. Buy it to complete the series, but don't expect much."
3,Lovely but far too simplistic,"This text is written for the true beginner and is perhaps much less scholarly than even the average reader might like. It relies heavily, as others have noted, on the idea of the transcendent unity of religion, which, however persuasive, requires considerably more argument.It does little to distinguish Vedanta from other viewpoints; instead, it seems oriented toward making Vedanta palatable for a certain kind of thoughtful Christian.Ultimately it is like a bag of candy, sweet without much to really chew on, and it will leave you at the end slightly disappointed and wanting more."
5,"Memory and trauma, therapeutic work",This is a very interesting book about how traumatic experiences are linked to memory issues. I am interested in this book to used with narrative therapy work with individuals and communities.
1,Hated Hated Hated!,"Well at least I didn't spend money on this one I checked it out of the library. I ablsolutley hate it when the main hero has sex with another woman and gets her pregnat!! And then still confess to loving the heroine Bull****! And the heroine like lets him get away with it to boot she does nothing, says nothing to him that is totally unrealistic I could not even read the whole book through as soon as I read that the main hero was with another woman I pretty much gave up right there I did skim through the pages and let me tell you is just got worse I find out that the woman he was with turns out pregnat! I would give this book no stars if possible. Total Trash!"
2,Rambling,"If you have read one of her books you've read them all. This may be the only one on Amazon to have a low rating, but I think they all deserve it as they all have more or less the same story and the reader is told about the same Indian traits."
3,Driver problems,"I bought this unit to replace a first generation Xitel unit. The main problem I am having with the M-Audio box is that if the iBook is restarted, the device driver does not show up. One has to unplug and plug in the USB cable to get it to show up. I should have bought the upgraded Xitel HiFi Pro unit instead (which comes with a full set of cables). This unit does not come with a fiber optic cable, the Xitel unit does, and is about the same price."
3,Great audio quality but a few usability issues,"The audio quality from this USB sound card is great. However, the input and output jacks are labeled very confusingly, and I have to use trial and error each time I hook it up.Also, the drivers perform flawlessly, but the installation is not at all automated -- you have to hunt around on the CD to find the right files for your operating system."
2,"Informative, but painfully boring.","This book would be ideal if for one reason or another you have to write a thesis on the witch trials. Hill describes most events as to the point where the reader no longer thinks of her as a succesful novelist, but rather a college professor who attempts to drill facts and ideas into your head in an insanely boring and tedious fashion. All too often, Hill's chapters open with a paragraph or two of what transpired in Salem, and then proceed to ramble on about what Freud would have thought of the girls antics, or what a modern psycho therapist would have offered as a diagnosis to their behaviors. If you want facts, philosophies, and more facts, and believe that perhaps one day you will be forced to take a comprehensive test on the Salem witch trials, then buy this book. However, if you have become interested in the witch trials because of intrigue, enigma, and lore, then this book will do nothing to further your enchantment or fascination."
2,Only bought for school reasons,"Only bought this book because it was on my syllibus for a class in University. The book itself is very outdated, bad written and unorganized! Can only recommend it if you HAVE to buy it!"
5,One of my favorites from Leslie,"This DVD is one of my favorite ""go-to's"" when I can't make up my mind which DVD to choose. I get a good workout without wearing myself out. There are (2) separate workouts each with a warm up and cool down. The group ranges in age from 20's to 70's and acts like they're happy to be there, which I find inspiring. IMO, the music is better than some of Leslie's other DVD's. The 'stretchie' is used during the 3 mile walk close to the end; it is not used at all during the 4 mile walk. Leslie does talk quite a bit...I don't find it annoying. It isn't one of the hardest, but I feel great after I'm done. You can boost it easily by stepping wider, bigger arm movements, jogging during the walking segments. It's also good for beginners as it is not TOO strenuous. The versatility makes it a good one."
1,This DVD never got to me :-(,I have NOT received the DVD so I can't rate it.. I don't understand why this DVD never got to me. It's been a year or so but still nothing.
3,"First ""Walk Away the Pounds"" Video","This is the first Leslie Sansome workout DVD I bought. I couldn't get over the fact that she wouldn't shut up! I've done the 3 mile a few times, and do it on mute. Sure, she's encouraging, but a whole hour of saying the same stuff? Come on.. anyway, I like that the moves are easy. I throw it in my rotation of workout DVDs when I don't want to think about what I'm doing. It does get boring though, but it's a nice moderate/low intensity workout. I find it a little awkward to do the band while walking in place, but I guess that's the whole point of the DVD. Overall, it's not my favorite, but it's a n easy enough workout video I could give to my younger sisters as well as my mom to try; especialy when it's too cold to walk outside."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,I bought this to go with the acai detox capsules. I saw no difference in my bowel movements both products were hard to swallow. I would recommend drinking warm green tea twice a day and eating activia from dannon. I had regular bowel movements and lost 10 pounds in 1 month without exercise just cut down on late night snacking I just bought green tea & activia at the grocery store and started drinking a cup b4 bed and ate a cup of activia for a snack.... I heart it!!!
2,Didn't work for me...,"I was on this for 2 weeks and kept thinking it was going to work sometime...but it only made me more constipated, but it seems to work for other people.If you seem to do fine on other herbs and stuff, this is probably for you, I am the type of person who isn't very regular and works to get enough fiber in my diet to go."
2,It sucked couldn't maneuver,Tried it and did not like it what so ever and tossed it away. It was just hard to play it.
5,Great Singer You Don't Wanna Miss!,"There is nothing more deep, precious, beautiful and at the same time instructive and entertaining than the Great Old French Music. And Jean Ferrat is one of its best represenatatives. Check this album (or any of his albums) out. It's breathtaking! You will never have enough once you try. And for those who know French it's an ocean of depth, meaning and wonderful poetry. I recommend to pay a special attention to such songs as: Maria, La Montagne, Que Serais-je Sans Toi, Potemkine, L'homme a L'oreille Coupee, Camarade, etc. Listen and you'll discover a whole new world. French music is the best!"
3,2.5 yr old likes the farm part but not overly interested in the space adventures,"My 2.5 yr old really finds the farm video entertaining, and I find parts kind of interesting too. It is a bit corny at times ... but then again this is for kids. For some reason he is not overly interested in the space adventure portion of the video which is a bit unusual as he is a big fan of space shuttle videos."
3,missing washers and poor instructions,"I've had a little stand similar to this before and prefer them, because I have limited space. I gave it 3 stars, because it meets my needs. It lost two stars for poor instructions and missing washers.I find the swivel hook and tray to be an interesting feature. The rubberized coating on them is good for the bike finish. I don't expect a lot of stability from a little holder like this."
4,Older gamer,This is much harder to play that the 1st Desert Storm game. The enemy move more while shooting at you making it hard to hit them. They also throw granades a lot. Most of the missions take place at night so get used to night vision. Over all it was worth playing and the graphics are better.
3,Bad packaging,The frame arrived damaged due to poor packaging. Two sides of the frame were bent. I still used the frame but the company needs to add a little foam or something when packaging for shipping.
3,The DVD quality is like a stuffed hagas,"This is one of my all time favorite films. This is a film that has inspired many things, among them two mediocre sequals and a epic masterpiece of a series. The camera angles were ahead of their time and the cinematography was outstanding. The soundtrack is a pump you up and leave you crying, suited perfectly for this tale. The reason this classic gets three stars instead of five is the crackly picture and the lack of special features. If you love this movie like I do buy it. If you want a perfect DVD retool your thought process and wait for the next edition."
5,Sweet,This edition was what i was waiting for! with previously unseen clips I was in awe! A must get for true Highlander fans!
1,Pathetic DVD,"While I am a fan of the movie, I bought the DVD in the hope of owning a quality copy of an excellent movie but was shocked by the fact that the DVD is only slightly better than the VHS..which is truly awful.I would not recommend this DVD."
4,Highlander,I love Sean Connery so I like to watch anything with him in it. This is a great movie with action. I love all the Highlander movies and the TV series too.
3,Not like the series,"I was disappointed in the quality of the film. It was slow, difficult to hear and see. I was not able to finish."
3,good movie..poor quality,"I saw this movie a few years ago...and it is still one of my absolute favourites. Sean Connery and Lambert does a great performance. I started thinking i was watching a documentary of immortals or something...almost hiding behind the couch in order to not get my head cut off. The atmosphere of the movie is encredible. The only bad thing is the sound(horrible)...its better than vhs but not much.The people behind this dvd really messed the thransfer up. If u are a big fan of highlander then you will probably buy this anyway,but for the rest of us its not worth it. It contains the worst got damn sound Ive ever heard in a dvd. Rent the movie or record it from cable instead,dont buy this."
1,"Movie is GREAT, dvd is horrible","I love this movie, so I was glad to buy this dvd as another copy, but it is worse than most VHS tapes I have. It says it has been remastered, but that has to be a lie.I have tried the DVD in my standard DVD player and 2 blu-ray players and the quality is horrible when played in all of those.There should be a class action against this dvd producer, but I think since most people only spent $10-20, they are just dealing with it."
5,Swords and Scorcery,"For those who are new to the Highlander movies and series, this movie is a little hard to figure what the heck is going on in the beginning, other than that it's action packed and a great movie."
3,Highlander,The movie is what I remembered but the sound was horrible I had to raise the volume on my system above the norm. Otherwise good
4,There can only be one ... And only one Highlander Movie !!!,"I have erased from memory all the horrible sequels that have followed, including the TV shows, and remain satisified with the one and only original (well Director's Cut that is) version of Highlander.The adaption of immortals weaving through time to obtain the 'prize' by eliminating each other until there is only one left, is an original and entertaining story.Connery is at his best in a great supporting role and Chris Lambert stars in the only movie that gives his acting(?) style any creadance.The additions are small, but add a lot to the original North American release.'The can only be one!' And this video is the 'ONE'"
4,NICE MOVIE BUT I FEEL TRICKED,THE MOVIE ITSELF IS VERY GOOD. THE TRANFER TO DVD IS VERY CLEAR AND SHARP WITH NO VISUAL ARTIFACTS AT ALL. ALSO REMIXING THE SOUNDTRACK WITH DOLBY EX AND DTS IS A REAL PLUS! BOTH SOUND GREAT. THERE DID SEEM TO BE A FEW SCENES ADDED TO THE FEATURE ALSO. DISC ONE ALSO PACKS THREE QUEEN VIDEOS AMD A RUNING COMMENTARY BY THE DIRECTORS WITH THE MOVIE IF YOU CHOOSE THIS OPTION. THER ALSO ARE STILLS AND SCENCE SELECTION OPTIONS. THEY INCLUDE A CD OF JUST THREE QUEEEN SONGS AND NOT THE REST OF THE SOUNDTRACK. (OR ANY OTHER MUSIC FOR THAT MATTER).WHAT A GREAT WASTE TO PRESS A COMPLETE CD AND ONLY PUT THREE SONGS ON IT. THE PACKAGE IS ALSO GOOD AND BAD. THE GOOD: THE ENTIRE DISC PACKAGE IS COVERED IN SMALL GAGE BRUSHED ALUMINUM COVER. THE BAD: THE INNER PLASTIC PACKAGE ON MINE BROKE TO PIECES WHEN I OPENED IT THE FIRST TIME. THE PRICE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS JUST TO HIGH. NOT RECOMMENED AT THIS PRICE.
3,Disappointed in the Extras,"I figured for the price, that the CD with music from the movie would be the WHOLE soundtrack, but instead there are only THREE songs on it. If I had realized that's what I was getting, I would have been a less-expensive DVD.The movie is as charming as ever, and there were some scenes I don't recall from the VHS that I am replacing with this ... but I think I paid too much."
2,Confusing and Overrated,"I am a fan of the Highlander:The Series t.v. show.So,I thought this movie would interest me.However,I found the plotline confusing and the camera work horrible.I hated the bad guy because the scenes he was in were pictured so confusingly that I became extremly irritated.I also think that the acting on the part of Christopher Lambert could have used a lot more work.To me,this film conplicates things for the series.If you want to see Highlander at its' best,watch the t.v. show."
3,"Good Moive, Okay Quality","I remember Highlander from many years ago, always watching it from VHS. Many memorable lines and scenes and all that great Queen soundtrack music. Well it's many years later and the story is still there but like anything that's 20 years old, it shows it's age a little. The fights seem tame to todays standards, but then again there is more to this movie than the fights. Back then it was a 21"" with VHS, today it's 91"" with DVD. Quite grainy and lacking, but again maybe an upconverter will help. The price was right, but I probably was better off just renting."
4,Good old movie,Just a good old movie at a reasonable price. My kids definately didn't like it as much as I did!
3,"Good movie, but . . .","First off, I would like to say this is a good movie, and it's story is very creative. I've watched many of the TV shows, so I understand the premise of the TV series now that I have seen this movie. However, the quality is VERY poor. I own the Monty Python DVD, which is I believe is an older movie than this one, and it has better quality this Highlander DVD! I can't believe it's THX certified. I think the guys at THX were drunk when they transferred this movie to DVD, because it's way too grainy, and the sound could have been improved a little more. If you can look past the poor picture and somewhat poor sound quality, then this movie is thoroughly entertaining."
1,Don't waste your money on the DVD!,"I am a huge Highlander fan and this DVD is terrible. I have never seen a DVD with such poor video quality. I have it on VHS which is the only way to go. The producers of Highlander did a diservice to fans by releasing an extremely sub-par version on DVD. Great movie, bad presentation. Save your money!"
3,ok movie,"The movie ""Highlander"" wasn't really a good movie. It wasn't bad, but the only reason I saw it was the soundtrack, done by Queen. I wouldn't go out and recommend it to everyone, but I won't say watching it was a waste of time. But at times I found it hard to pay attention. It took a long time to develop."
4,what a bargain.,A great classic tale. For the price you can't pass it up. I am surprised at the lack of quality in this DVD. I found the audio problem immediatly and I am far from a critic. It suffered from the classic too quiet too loud. I also felt the audio didn't quite sync well enough. I can only assume that they had poor materials to work with. In any case if it was value over perfection I would still by the value. As always it's good to have a choice. Do you here that studios?
1,Do Not Order from Orion,"Orion took my order with express shipping on December 17th without an out of stock warning. Charged my bankcard saying the shipment will arive by Christmas Eve, 12/24 at the latest. Never contacted me. Then with no more word from the company, when I called to enquire about the shipping status on the 21st, they said they were out of stock and would not be able to deliver before the 28th. The only thing they offered me was a cancellation, but then told me it may take up to 10 days to credit my bank card, because it had to go through Amazon. Amazon is trying to help me get my credit sooner. Orion acted irresponsibly. Do not trust this company."
2,"Sometimes Great, Oftentimes Terrible","I love almost all of the Secret Chiefs 3 albums, with the sole exception of First Grand Constitution and Bylaws. Sadly, this dvd is largely reminiscent of that cd. Some of the songs/sets are great, but far more of them are just strange, self-masturbatory noise."
1,An accurate title,"Hypothetically, if by some freakish miracle, someone actually manages to finish these dismal, discraceful book, they will see just how accurate the title of the novel is. You see, by the end, you will infact want to kill yourself.If you have a death with and decide to read this ************** book, then at least skip the forst 3 chapters as they make absolutely no friggn sense what so ever."
3,A sword is a sword,I was impressed with the workmanship. I just thought it would be a little bigger. Great decorative sword. I did not know it was going to be so small. I am glad I only paid 18 bucks for the sword.
1,"Good only if you like Jazz. Otherwise, a snooze-fest","I used to love jazz albums. My radio dial was always tuned to KKGO which was the jazz station in L.A. a long time ago. This album will appeal to you if you are into jazz. It is not chill, or cutting edge or anything of the sort. It is a jazz album that verges on muzak. I was so dissapointed with it. It immediately has been relegated to the bottom shelf of my five thousand plus cd collection. Out of sight out of mind. If you like instrumental jazz, then you will like this. If you are a fan of music that is more of the 21st century...you need to keep searching."
2,I cringe just thinking about Hard Hat Harry DVDs...,"My son loves these videos and could watch them all day - if I hadn't hidden all of them. Hard Hat Harry makes me want to throw up. The kids in the show are disgusting Barney-esque actors too. They totally overact and make me cringe. I'm so surprised other viewers commend these videos, I guess if you need your child to sit still for 30 minutes. But hopefully I'm not in the room also when it's on."
4,ABC's of Friendship!,"This is the ultimate gift book for a close friend. I'm giving it to a friend as a gift, and I would also like to recieve one. You can share your true feelings and it gives you a good layout to do so."
5,Wow what a book!,This book is a must read book and demonstrates the awesomeness and power of God through Christ. I cried with joy at some of the accounts. I do not want to say too much in case I spoil it for future readers. May this book bless you as much as it has blessed me.
3,English Tea,"A good English tea, I purchased 6 boxes of Scottish Breakfast Tea by TH at the same time, both are quite good."
5,Robust black tea without the bitterness.,After living in Europe for a number of years I've become a bit of a tea snob. So when I discovered this nice Assam was available in the States I was very happy. It's a nice strong tea without the bitterness that you get in many of the State-side black teas. For instance...Starbuck's Tazo tea Awake is just bitter and nasty.
3,Hard Hat Harry,"Alot of technical information, so your child must be able to stay alert and pay attention -- if they like that sort of thing. My son liked it for a while but lost interest. It does have a bit of fun mixed in with the facts."
2,Hardly made a difference,"I was disappointed in these bulbs. While they are good quality bulbs, they made little difference in light output and/or white-ness of the light compared to my Lexus LX 470's original OEM bulbs. Was not worth the money for me."
3,Good Western Music,The music on this CD is really great. The era from which this music was is a lost era of music. Thanks for getting this together
3,I am the Author Of This Book!,"Hi everyone!I am the author of this novel and I'd like to say to me this book is wonderful but it does howevere needs some improvments which is the Publishers fault. I am glad that there are some people who like it it makes me happy knowing that my book is being read by some people at least. I am 21 now and I live in Mississauga, Ontario. If you'd like info on Book 2 or any other books email me at Mystdip@aol.com or if you have ICQ# 61801222"
2,"If you need help , you will not find it here","When I decide to buy a book, I almost always rely on reviews of other readers to help me decide if I want to purchase it or not. This was the same for this book. The surprise was when I found my self so out of tune with everyone else. Everyone else Liked it, while I did not find it at all useful. Going around the world is a relatively serious undertaking, and I was looking for some pointers. This book had none. It was more of road impressions written in a non-imaginative style. I would borrow it from a library or buy it used rather than pay USD10 plus shipping for it. The author himself said his earlier books contained the nuts and bolts of how to travel while this one adopts a different style. If you are like me.... preparing ... this is not the book for you."
3,It's Not So Great...,"We love the Backyardigans and had seen the It's Great To Be A Ghost on television. That video is cute, but the others on the DVD aren't great - specifically Soccer Monster of which I find no redeeming qualities. We also have the Castaways DVD which we all find much more entertaining and educational and fun."
1,Although order some time ago have yet to recieve,Still waiting for shipment after ordering close to 2 months ago
5,Great Idea,Very handy product for clean up during our walks. I like the fact that it attaches to the leash so it's always accessable. I carry a larger plastic grocery bag to bag all the used bags in. It works great. I wish everyone who walked their dog would utilize one of these. Refills are available at Target in the pet care section.
4,"Simple, convenient, compact.","Not my favorite task, but now not so awful either. I carry the dispenser around and when it's time to use it I pull out a bag, pick up the mess, and we're on our way. For years I've been using the shopping bags from grocery stores, and I can't tell you the number of times I've pulled one out only to discover it had a hole in it! Besides, the trend at grocery stores is increasingly to use your own re-usable canvas bags so there goes that supply source. These are a much more reliable way to go."
2,good concept poor quality,"I like the concept and really enjoyed never having to worry about taking a bag with me, however the hanger broke quickly which made it useless."
2,Hard to work the clip,"The bags are easy to load, but the clip is so stiff, I still haven't been able to open it. Thankfully, my dog leash has its own clasp to slide through the doggie bag clip."
1,Not durable,You will be lucky to get through one roll of bags if you are lucky. It's really cheaply made so I would suggest trying something else.
2,Not very sturdy,"This worked good for awhile....but after a couple of months the clip broke and the screw top stopped screwing on tightly enough to stay. The thought was good, and it was easy to refill and easy to dispense bags, but we finally gave up and now we just shove a bag or two in our pockets before going outside. Easier than fighting with plastic bag dispensers."
4,Bags on Board Convenient,This is very convenient to have on hand when walking my poodle. The bags are sturdy enough. I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because the bags are a little hard to determine where to pull off and I have pulled out several at once. However the convenience of carrying on the leash in the bone is well worth it.
4,Picking Up!,A gret product for picking up the lumps in the grass or the dog park. Convenient for carrying along on a dog walk.
2,Sticking with Sandwich Bags...,"I've tried a couple of different dog bag brands and dispensers, and none really work that well to me. Unless I take the time before the walk to get the bag open it's always a struggle to detach the bag from the roll and then to get it to open up. Maybe there's some trick I'm missing, but especially when I have 2 dogs pulling on their leashes while I struggle to open up a bag I'm going to go with what's easiest, and for me ziplocks are a thousand times easier to open. They do have the disadvantage of being see-through, but garbage cans normally aren't too far away."
4,Super convenient,This is so much more awesome than stuffing grocery bags into my pockets. Very easy to refill. One gripe is that the clip that attaches to the leash is incredibly stiff. The plastic didn't have much give so trying to unhook the clip just to attach it was more of a challenge than expected.
5,Bags on board are very convienent,"Bags on Board are easy to attach to the leash or lead and makes it convienent to always have with you. Bags pull out easily and are big enough for a small dog but I'm not too sure about a large dog, you may need to use 2."
3,Tends to pop open,I use this when running with my dogs and the 'bone' has opened up several times - It doesn't close very well - the threads aren't that strong - I would like it to be able to shut tightly. Other than that it's cute and nice especially if you aren't doing a lot of activities where a leash or something else can knock it open.
4,Around The Bend CD,"Recently watched the movie and liked it, but I noticed that I also really enjoyed the soundtrack."
2,lots of jams,"I get a lot of nail jams with my dewalt rechargeable finish nailer. The gun is new and it is the first I have ever used...so it is possible that the problem is with me or the gun. I think I go through as many nails clearing a jammed gun as regular use. I bought 1.5, 2, and 2.5 inch lengths and all perform the same. It is very frustrating. When things are working properly this nailer makes life much easier, though."
5,Stirring,"This book was given to me by a good friend. He thought I, as a Vietnam vet, would identify with some of the stories. It is one of the absolutely most enjoyable books I have ever read. I even slowed down my usual reading speed to savor the stories . Each day, in the sunshine of my patio, I read two or three stories. Every story got my full attention. I even found one story about a man I knew in the army. I adamently recommend this book to any veteran."
5,A fantastic assortment of stories from numerous conflicts around the world by veterans and friends of veterans.,"A fantastic assortment of true stories about veterans from various conflicts around the world told by friends and by those involved. Unknown heroes are brought to life in exciting, short stories that depict heroic, compassionate, and thrilling events that these veterans have experienced. A great read that brings otherwise unknown veteran's stories to light."
1,WOW ..... can't think of a worse book,I mean this book is os so bad that I just can't even bring myself to remember why I hated it so much ...Most of the book is converstaional with a ver very liberal use of ... to I guess was done to explain to the reader that most of the sentences don't make any sense ....I tell ya this book is pure torture ....
3,A book of narrative verse,"This is not a review of the writings in this book but rather a review of the actual physical book.The 'publisher' copied this book from someone's used copy - there are notes and jottings on various pages indicating this - and placed a new cover on the copy. It was deceptive. Also some of the poems that were contained in the original publication of ""A book of Narrative verse"" were not included in this 'publication'. Very disappointed."
5,inbloomswingoutsister,"lush.warm.pops.sparkles.deephighsjumpinglows.transcending soundscapes. all these words are only a few that can describe swing out sister. this album pays tribute to so many and that is what makes this group so refreshing and new each time they step into the studio and go to press.this is a soulfull album.jazzy breezy and emotional. you can hear brazil, the philadelphia sound a little motown and of course Bacharach.the release of this album will occur in october of this year. much too long of a wait to join the many who are already in the know and have been for years. the import price is worth its weight. yen for pound to dollar.go beyond the same ol'tired boring set of barfed up pop out there. swing out sister brings so much. fantabulous to the exquisite. in short. THIS IS ANOTHER GEM FROM A BADASS BAND. AN EXCELLENT ALBUM.PERIOD."
5,Exactly what i was looking for,I puchased these shoes for my grandmother who had looked throughout her entire city and could not find them. This was exactly what she needed. Thank you.
3,Too many ads!!,"My 2 year old daughter loves Calliou so I bought this DVD along with two others. There are too many ads from PBS and not enough of the actual Calliou show. I have to fast forward ALOT.I realize some DVD's have ads but this is ridiculous! She still watched it but as I said, I fast forwarded alot!"
2,Not what I expected,"I have a 2 year old who loves Caillou, but is terrified of the puppets that host the older versions, when I read the packaging on this it lead me to believe it was made in 2011, when those creepy puppets no longer where on the show. Well I was mislead, 3 of the 4, 30 minute sets are the old version and we have to do alot of fast forwarding to keep those puppets away, and it does not fast forward like a regular DVD it skips like 30 second blocks, kind of strange!!"
5,Totally great comp,"This is a fantastic compilation for introducing anyone to great soul music. Of course there is more, maybe better records out there, many by these artists, but as a whole, you can't go wrong with this set. It delivers all the love and funk and soul you could want."
4,Pretty good for the kids,"It's OK. Our kids like listening to it when they are tired. I wish it was a little less ""childish"" so the songs were a little more authentic."
3,worth a look if you are very much into photography,"Loads of photographs, of various quality. might be useful as study tool but not too many images stroke a chord with me."
4,MZB Sword and Sorceress II,"MZB's Sword and Sorceress II, is a great add on for my home library. Yes, I prefer printed materials on paper. I tried a NOOK, but really with the advent of large television sets, who wants to strain their eyes? I prefer the more visceral feel of a printed book.I have read as many Marion Zimmer Bradley, works over the years as I have been able to lay my hands on. But was a late comer to her anthology series(s). Then to my surprise I found that what she liked in different authors are basically what I like too. So I have been on a quest to ferret out her anthologies. Her wry views on life at the start of each story, are as much of a treat as her books has always been to me. Each Christmas, I go vainly in search of a new novel even though she has been dead since 1999. So I troll the second hand stores and Amazon, in a never ending quest to find her printed gold."
2,Not so Mysterious Mountain...,"I've always enjoyed John Williams film music, so I was curious about his interpretation of Hovhaness' best-known piece; however, his rendition seems flat, lacking in energy, and devoid of any interpretive nuance. Compared to the well-known Reiner recording, it sounds like no more than a run-through.I was similarly curious about Williams' Bassoon Concerto, as I enjoy hearing that instrument featured by other composers, but again I was disappointed. To me it had a disjointed singsong quality and went nowhere. It seemed neither beautiful, nor dramatic, nor atmospheric.I won't comment on the other compositions, as I didn't get this disk to hear them; other reviewers have covered them sufficiently. A final note: the recording quality as regards imaging and soundstaging is mediocre, which seems inexcusable from a major label."
2,MC 5 - 'Extended Versions' (BMG Special Products),"Ten live tracks here,mostly aimed at the true MC 5 hardcore fans and completists.Sound isn't that good,STILL I've heard worse.Not sure if this live concert has been released under any other title.If you're patient and are willing to take time fiddling around with your stereo controls,you MIGHT be able to 'set' the dismal sound to appear to be semi-acceptable.I sort of did just that.Some of the listenable cuts here are the opener ""Kick Out The Jams"",""Revolutionary Blues"",the classic MC 5 foot-stomper ""Looking At You"",a Booker T.Jones classic that was made well known by Cream ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" and their eleven-minute closer ""Black To Comm"".If you want to check out some really great archive live MC 5,hunt down a copy of 'Teenage Lust' and 'Live At Sturgis Armory'(see my reviews of both)."
3,Well...,"This is an edited version of ""Motor City Is Burning."" If you own that, don't buy this. If you want a longer CD, go for that one.If you only own the three standard albums and want to dig a bit deeper, this may be a good place to start. The quality is a bit rough...you really have to listen to MC5 non-album material less critically or else none of it will please you.This is fairly average in terms of the ""extra"" MC5 releases...if you can enjoy this, you're set to start collecting. If not, you only wasted a few dollars."
1,Cheap Junk,"Thin junk. The cover is not removable, so you have to wash the whole thing. After on washing it got lumpy. Not worth $100."
4,Imaginative with interesting illustrations,"This book is a frequently-requested bedtime read for my 2-year old. The illustrations have a lot going on so there is great opportunity for pointing out hens, trees, the teddy bear looking out the window, etc. The story is simply told yet imaginative."
5,I want more!,"I loved this book! The art is simple, yet powerful. The story, informative, heartwarming and compassionate. And all done by one person, which is not all that common. I actually FELT for the characters, I felt like I knew them. That's a sign of great storytelling.This book was recommended to me by Scott McCloud. I have to say, one of the better graphic novels I've come across yet."
4,A Beautiful Book.,"This book was beautiful. Beautifully drawn, beautifully written, and beautifully lived. The simple cartoons and dialogue make the confusing and multi-faceted story and events that shape it both conceivable and real. As some one who knew very little about this conflict and certainly never knew some one who'd lived through it, this was eye-opening in more ways than one. It gave me new perspectives on things I would never have thought twice about otherwise. And the most amazing part is that as dramatic and frightening and real the story is to the reader, one can only imagine how much more so it must have been for the author who really lived through it. She, like all the others who fought for their independence, is truly heroic."
1,It's a Comic Strip!,"Man, was I disappointed. This book is a comic strip. It may have had a lot of meaning, to those involved at the time it was written, with many government stings hidden in the strip, but for enjoyable reading, it stunk. I got through it in half an hour, hardly my idea of buying good reading."
5,My Experience with Amazon,"Delivery Service ReviewI will be writing a review on the delivery speed of Amazon, which is ultimately the service. I am a first time buyer on Amazon, August 27,2010 I bought my first item off of this website. This item was a book named Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. On the 31st I received the book around 9:35-ish in the morning, which was very convenient for me. Amazon estimated the date and time in which the book should be delivered to me, their estimate was September 2 (2 days late, however that isn't bad since I needed the book read for my AP Lit. class by the 7th). There is also an optional to have Amazon text to your cell phone updates on the delivery of the book, I chose this option. However, the text came about 3 hours later saying that the book was being delivered to my address. Despite that minor fact, all in all Amazon service quality was great!Demetria TaylorChicago, ILLindblom Math and Science"
4,excellent,"This is the autobiography of a spunky, smart girl growing up in Iran, in the time of the revolution. At first, since it is done in a black and white cartoon format you may be tempted to think this is going to be a kids book. It's not. With each page you will become more and more afraid for the high spirited girl and her sophisticated, educated parents. Although she's just a kid, her questions and taste for Western music and clothes is dangerous. How long before the secret police come knocking at the door? How will it turn out? You've got to read the book."
4,Illustrating history,"Marjane Satrapi chooses an original format for describing the Islamic Revolution and one child's place in it. Satrapi grew up in 1970s Iran with two outspoken parents who encouraged her to express her views. Coming of age into a country in tumult, she discovers that expressing her views might not always be welcome or safe. Truly funny moments, including Satrapi's dad smuggling contraband rock music posters under his coat, bump up against moments of horrifying brutality and upheaval. Will Marjane ""bow her head and let the wave pass"" or will she stand up against oppression?I started this book knowing very little about Iran and its people. Not only did I get to know a brave and intelligent young woman, I also learned a lot about a country's role in modern history."
5,Great Deal,"For the price, the 'Glorious Pipes' CD proves to be a great value; really two CDs for the price of one. The variety of selections makes for some great listening. I recommend this CD package highly; definitely a great bargain. In terms of making the purchase I found the detailed listing very helpful. I had checked other CDs in terms of composer, compositions and organists, but kept coming back to this CD. To sample the music is a great highlight prior to ordering, though this CD stood alone, in my opinion, merely by great pieces of music being presented."
5,"GREAT STOOL, SHORT $$","I DID NOT FIND THE STOOL TOO SQUISHY AS OTHERS DID. IT IS STURDY, FUNCTIONAL AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, ESP. WITH FREE SHIPPING."
3,Broke in less than a week,"I agree with ""price equal to quality"" and ""great product . . poorly constructed."" I received this stool on 12/22 and it was broken by 12/27, and I didn't use it more than 2 or 3 times. It did not roll as smoothly as I expected, and it dug up my unfinished pine board floors. The seat was very comfortable, and the height adjustment was great, but I went to roll on it one day & one of the wheels just snapped off. And, of course, it's plastic, so it can't be fixed. There goes 50 bucks down the drain. It would probably be best if used on a floor similar to that found in hospitals - laminate tile over cement; not linoleum over wood or plain wood."
4,great chair!,"This is a great chair, especially for the price as compared to similar ones that are quite a bit more. The size is perfect for tight spaces, I love having the easy height adjustment depending on what I'm doing around the massage table, and the wheels work smoothly. As some others have commented, the seat is a bit squishier than I've experienced on other stools which was unsettling at first, but it was easy to get used to and doesn't really affect the performance of the stool. Overall a great buy that I'm very happy with!"
1,Dangerous,"On about the third time I used this stool in my photography studio, two of the plastic legs snapped whilst I was sat on it making a minor position adjustment. I was thrown backwards landing on my back along with the expensive camera equipment I was holding. Fortunately my only injury was to my pride as I was working with several clients at the time, but it could have easily been more serious. This item is dangerous and I would seriously beware of purchasing it. Amazon customer service were excellent in helping me return this product."
5,Nice chair and easy to put together,I bought this chair because the reviews seemed pretty good. There were no instructions with it so it was a little trial and error but everything went fine. I have not had a chance to use it yet so I will update this after I use it for a little while. So far I am happy with it.Update: I have had this chair for a while now and still really love it. The only con I would say is that it is a little loud because I have wood floors. I am not sure if I would find any that would be quieter when I roll it around. It has held up well.
1,Rolling Stool,"This stool lasted 2 weeks. The plastic that connects the wheels cracked. The wheels are now at parallel to the flow, making the stool unusable."
4,Beverly Hills 90210,I love this show. Waiting for the entire collection to be available on DVD... I would buy it!
4,Great interpretation.....good musicallity,"This CD is one of the best I have heard of the Bach Solo Violin Works. Although she tends to take things too fast for my likeing, all of the musical qualities are there. A violinist myself, I respect the virtuosity she exhibits when she plays. This is defiently a worthwhile purchase for a violinist who is listening to different interpretations, or a lover of the Bach Partitas and Sonatas."
2,Fine artist but poor rendition,"Hilary Hahn's sweet tone and grounded approach to her development are trademarks that make her a well-rounded, likeable and emotional artist. Her Beethoven recording is a must-have. All of my violin students are required to listen to her Beethoven concerto when we begin studying it. Unforuntately, her Bach recording is not as special. I had the opportunity to hear her rendition of Partita No. 3 and there was a distinct lack of direction in phrasing and depth which isn't her best. If you want to add this CD to your collection because you must have a complete Hahn collection, well....but if not, you probably won't miss it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have been baking bread at home for a number of years and have read and used a number of baking books. This book has to be the most pretentious and boring books i have ever owned. The recipes are virtually impossible for the home baker. ""During this time, it's crucial that you watch over your starter as a parent watches over a newborn. Don't miss a feeding! Other recipes may require starters to be fed only once a day, but think how you feel at the end of the day if you don't eat until dinner."" I don't think my boss would be happy if i dragged my starter to work to make sure it got fed every 4 to 6 hours! There is no fermentation station at work. Try Peter Reinhart's ""The Bread Baker's Apprentice"" and for rye and bagels (true NY water bagels) try Ginsberg and Berg's ""Inside the Jewish Bakery"". Mel Leffler"
1,The Most Wasteful Sourdough Ever!,"I tried this book in my search for info on baking ""artisan"" breads. Her process for making a sourdough ""levain"" is ridiculous. It requires a great deal of flour, most of which she recommends discarding along the way! If she runs her business on this model, she can't possibly be making any money. I also agree that she makes it uneccesarily complicated and esoteric. It's bread- a daily staple- that's the miracle- it's simple.Instead, I recommend ""The Village Baker"", by Joe Ortiz- it's here on Amazon in paperback. He also gives much more comprehensive info on why certain techniques are used and regional bread recipes."
4,The Amulet Of Samarkand,"The sulfur cloud contracted into a thick column of smoke that vomited forth tendrils... There was a barely perceptible pause. Then two yellow staring eyes eyes materialized in the heart of the smoke.Hey, it was his first time. I wanted to scare him.Written by a quick-witted djinni, The Amulet of Samarkand is a `must-read' for all ages. Nathaniel was sold as a magician's apprentice when he was only five years of age, and under the watchful eye of his master Arthur Underwood, he grew up gaining knowledge of both the human world and the magic. Nathaniel summons a powerful djinni to take revenge on his master, but, after all, demons are hard to contain, and soon Nathaniel and his charge are both in a lot of trouble."
5,A Real Page Turner.,"Just when you think that you are getting to the end of what literary wizards can achieve with Rowling and Pullman, along comes Stroud with his brilliant and inventive fantasy. Containing a narrative split between Nathaniel (a boy apprentice wizard and his mischievous djinn (as in genie) Bartimaeus, we are catapulted into an alternative modern London where commoners (such as ourselves) are hardly worth mentioning and wizards rule the government. Our journey follows Nathaniel as he unwittingly steals an amulet from a powerful wizard, Simon Lovelace, as revenge for the boys mistreatment. Little does he know that this theft will unleash a devastating train of events which he seems powerless to prevent. One of the best fantasies I've read for quite sometime. Move over Rowling and Pullman. There's a new kid on the block!"
5,Fantastic,"This book is a great read - especially considering the young age of the author! It has all the great elements - action, adventure, mystery, and humor - yes, humor. Bartimaeus' character has a wonderfuly caustic sense of humor that had me laughing out loud on several occasions! I simply couldn't put the book down!!! Luckily for me, its easy to read and keeps your interest. I highly recommend it for all ages!!!"
2,Bearable,"I had to struggle to force myself to finish this book, and that too was for the sake of reading more of Bartimaeus' view. Every single magician in this book, Nathaniel included, has a nearly undetectable conscience. I, personally, was unable to relate to or like any character, but, of course, Bartimaeus, who is undeniably the life's blood of this book. He is incredibly witty, and the footnotes were hilarious. The book reminded me vaguely of the Artemis Fowl series, though not as well written. All in all, I will valiantly attempt to proceed in finishing the trilogy, out of pity for the author, and to see some more of Bartimaeus."
4,GREAT BOOK,"Of course my favorite parts in the book were Bartimaeus's parts,I love the footnotes also the little snipets about Bartimaeus's past, i hope they play a part in the other books (like who is the boy Bartimaeus liked to turn into?) The Magic is different than in Harry Potter. But this is still a really good book. I am kinda wondering if the next book is going to stay with Nathaniel or if somebody else is going to call Bartimaeus."
5,Amulet of Samarkand,"Phenomenal read! Very, very easy to get through. Superbly written. Kind of like an evil version of the Harry Potter world... except, well, not. I loved it. Proof that not all must be roses and fluff to be wonderful and magic! This book was part of a series that I just couldn't put down. Highly recommended when you want something entertaining and consuming with lots of Djinn."
5,A Great Book,"The Amulet of Samarkland is probably one of my favorite books of all time. It is full of magic and betrayal and keeps the reader up all night! The Amulet of Samarkland is about the ambitious adventures of Nathaniel, a young magician, who struggles to take his revenge only to find himself deep in a possibly fatal conspiracy. He employs the witty and clever dijini Bartimaeus to work with him and at the same time save him with his ancient experience. What I find most interesting and unique to this book are the clever footnotes at the bottom of the pages conveying the humourous thoughts if Bartimaeus. Overall, The Amulet of Samarkland is an excellent read for anybody of all ages. Also, it can be read many times over with the same satifaction at the end every time."
4,"""Cthulhuesque "" magic!","A tale introducing two radically different and contrary main characters, Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimeus the powerful and clever djinni. The book focuses on their strained relaltionship and differs from the Harry Potter books in its portrayal of magic as the conjuring and subsequent binding of mischievous spirits, rather than spellslinging and waving of wands. ""Cthuluesque"" could be a good description of the Bartimeus-magic, when the mythology-part is slightly subratracted from the lot. The idea of a Britain run by a stuck-up class of magicians, takes some time to get used to, but eventually works. The language is fluent and does not strand with any particular age-category. Recommended."
1,Disappointed with Shipping/3rd Replacment in shambles,I was so excited to finally have found this cake dome but so disappointed when it arrived in shambles -3 different times! The outside of the box was in perfect condition but there was no indication that this was fragile. I finally have given up. I guess I'll have to start searching the old fashioned way - by actually going to the stores where they might stock something like this.
3,Probably should not buy glass online.,"The first one came shattered. I received a box of glass shards. The replacement came quickly, and it is a good stand for large cakes. I make good use of it is a decorative piece on my counter with either a cake, fresh brownies, cookies, or fruit/vegetables."
3,Cute but fragile,"At first I was disappointed that these earrings were smaller than I thought they'd be and the colors are not as bright, but they quickly grew on me. However, after only wearing them about 3 times, the part that hooks into your hear broke off the earring rendering them unwearable. I am completely disappointed because I loved these earrings."
5,Coco hits another home run,"Outstanding. Makes you feel that you are there while the battle is swirling around, and the deeply personal aspect is touching. Along with its sister companion ""Confederates killed in action at Gettysburg"", it is a must read for the light it shines on the last moments of these soldiers, giving the ultimate sacrifice for a cause they believed was true and right."
3,good patterns book whilst learning c#- only,"The book explains why and where you should apply which patterns with diagrams for a beginner which is a good approach. For practicallity, there section explaining and demonstrating delgates was the best book I have seen. There is lots of non-runable code eg. chain of responsibility , flyweights which forced me to refer to other c# patterns books. Some other topics were just too dificult to follow like the momento, template and GUI kits.Again I had to refer to the James W. Cooper c# pattern book and examples. This was definelty a tough book to grasp"
2,It's a book about rockets and fireworks,"The book is more like a supplement to the classic ""Design Patterns"" by the Gang-of-Four. But it doesn't explain the pros and cons of each design pattern, and its examples aren't solid and don't help to lead you to the point. It has quite some coverage on rockets and fireworks and I found them more distractive than helpful. Not recommended. Instead, people should just go and read the classic book by GoF again."
1,"this is a book on fireworks, not design patterns","chapter on Bridge is a disaster! Few sentences on design patterns and many on fireworks. Page 68 what in blazes is a handshaking machinemanager? Poor writing!Authors: Before you publish a book, have a neophyte read the book! I'll do it if the subject interests me.I mean a neophyte who is not a ""yes"" man!A coherent application would help but not this scattered mess on fireworks!What is this? You say I should deduce what the man is saying? Then I should just write my own book. By the way, the GOF book gets a C- from me. Poorly written. I ordered the code and had to work extensively on it to make it even compile. At least oozinoz builds with some minor alterations."
4,Why only 1 star???,"Honesty I think this book is great and yes there are aspects of the book that could be improved but overall its still a great book. I think if you are serious about becoming a PRO software engineer, you should checkout this book. More books like this should be written to help programmers grasp the more complex area of OOP.This book is not for beginners, you must have a fairly good understanding of GOF design patterns in order to help you consolidate your knowledge."
2,"Ugh, Such a Textbook","I got this book because it was the only book on design patterns at the bookstore; maybe I should have browsed Amazon instead! My first impressions is that it is dry, abstract, old-fashioned, even occasionally pedantic. He seems to skip the basics of each pattern, perhaps assuming that the reader is already familiar.I write software for a living, I know how important good design is, but Metsker seems to think we'll just take his word for it when he claims that such-and-such a design is the Only Correct Way. How about some examples of how each pattern could solve real design problems?While I found them tiresome, the quizzes sprinkled throughout may be useful for new programmers. But if they take this book to heart, they may ""learn"" that there's always one (and only one) correct solution to a problem. Real development is not so simple."
2,Great character; terrible toy,"My 2.75 year old loves Mater! However, he has had two of these, and BOTH had their front wheels fall off within an hour of play.Terrific character, but a terrible toy.Sorry, Pixar--but you licensed this toy to the wrong manufacturer.So much for branding, huh."
5,Gromit the hero,Gromit is our favorite dog (OK together with Shaun the Sheep and that dog) I originally ordered all thesemovies for my grand daughter but the audience is always the three of us we love it!
1,Just very dull.,Not the same as other Wallace and Gromit's. My kids love all those and Shawn the Sheep. They say this is just talking with little action or good story.
3,See Wallace & Gommit in small bites,"This is a series of young adult shows on different human inventions, not Wallace & Grommit's. Kind of disappointed in that but Wallace still plut Grommit in dangerous situations on every show. For those that are huge W&G fans...do add this to your collection."
4,A Good Sampler for an Important Decade,"I'll keep this short since much of what I was going to say has already been said in other reviews. In brief, this is a nice sampler of, for lack of a better term, post-punk music heard on many college radio stations in the 1980s. This was a decade that, for whatever reasons, tends to get downplayed in regard to the quality of the music heard on the airwaves--this compilation should help dispel that notion. Like many such collections, Left of the Dial has inspired me to seek out the albums/cds that some of these songs were originally recorded on. If I have a complaint, it's that a number of these songs appear on other compilations by Rhino; my pet peeve: can't they find another song by the Hoodoo Gurus besides I Want You Back? Stoneage Romeos has any number of good tunes--c'mon guys, mix it up a little. Anyway, that aside, this is a worthwhile collection of music."
2,Good selection Poor Sound,Selection and rendition was excellent. The recording company did not give it any justice. The output of the CD is too weak and hardly audible even with volume on the MAX.
3,Key Rock Hider,"This product does look like a real rock, but it is quite small. It blends in nicely with the rocks in my yard."
4,Speak on Lord - I hearth & I obey,"You can tell that the author is acknowledging that the Lord is first in all things.That we must Stop, Look & Listen to his daily influence in every step of our life. Her book made me realize that God is there! Right at the door waiting for us all to say ""I Heard you, Lord."" one of my many favorites is (When He Knocks at the Door)."
1,ohhh noooo...,"welll, I'd like to say I cannot stand this girl...her voice just irritates me...every time I hear her on the radio, I just feel like throwing it out the window and smashing the radio into pieces. Like a bird...yeah..please do not insult the birds..they chirp better than you do. Why don't you be the kind of bird that fly to the north pole and never come back. She sounds like she needs lots of Vicks or Barclays cough drops....I don't know how people can listen to the whole album..must be some kind of art thing I don't understand...what a shame to the music industry!."
3,Monkees Summer 1967,"Being a die hard Monkees fan, I throughly enjoy Summer of 1967. For historical purposes it's great, however if your looking for great sound, or if you're a casual fan of the Monkees, I would pass on buying this set. Buy a studio album instead."
1,treat with caution,"i found this one of the most profoundly disturbing books i have ever read. some glimpses of beauty with a continuum of terror. difficult to believe that it came from the same hand as that which wrote the brilliant ""four wise men"". after reading i threw it away so that no one else could read it......."
1,Poor performance,"After thoroughly checking toaster reviews and ratings (this got top ratings), I had to return it after several attempts to get it to produce evenly toasted bread. Very disappointing; my old Toastmaster (much less expensive) does better."
1,I wouldn't call this a toaster,"I sent the toaster back. It toasted the bread in a V shape and only on one side. But in defense of this brand, I have purchased two other toasters after this one and sent them back also. You just can't find a toaster that will brown bread evenly on both sides. It doesn't matter how much you pay.This toaster also got so hot, I was afraid one of my grandkids would get burned."
4,Plezzz'd,"Was very plezzz'd with this toaster, just wish it would toast quicker. Very stylist and fits our kitchen decor just great. We like the Bagel setting it works great......."
5,Excellent toaster,"We had a rather expensive Cuisinart toaster that never really worked very well and fell apart after about 2 years. I did a lot of research and decided to buy this Krups toaster. I have had it about 2 months and it works great. It is very sturdy, it toasts very evenly and the warmer function is great. I particularly like the 3 level lift for removing small items. Do use the toaster empty a couple of times when it is brand new. I did it outside and I could really smell the plastic-y smell."
4,Toasts a little slow,I love the looks & features of this toaster....you can raise the toast up after toasting with the lever....also has defrost and bagel feature. Very nice quality.It does toast slow though...thus a 4 star rating.
4,Excellent cook book for professionals,Certainly the book is not for beginners. But it was a real help in my recent practical work. Lots of tips and tricks. Highly recommended for the SAP Workflow consultant desktop.
3,Good but not for new Workflow Developer,"I just purchased this book and gone thru first few chapters. What i feel is this book is not for people who are new to Workflow. In other words, SAP online documention is very good to learn how to work with SAP workflow. But this book is going to provide very good practical knowledge once you have some knoledge with workflow."
3,"Ok, not worth $13","They're ok sunglasses and seem fairly durable, however the frames are crooked and feel funny. Definently not worth the $13"
3,This tent is actually smaller than 9 x7--edited: Amazon corrected the size so I will give 5 stars now!,"The rain cover is larger than other tents in the same price range, and the fact the base becoming the part of the side wall makes this tent good for rainy, windy weather. I just put up the tent in my living room, and I do not see myself in a wet sleeping bag in this tent outdoor. The small porch at the entrance makes this tent even better. I am satisfied with my purchase."
2,OK tent for the money...if you don't mind getting rained on,"I would have given this tent 4 or 5 stars if it hadn't rained during my trip. Very lightweight and extremely easy to put up. The porch-type door that can be propped up was great. Especially when it was just raining lightly...I could put stuff under it that I didn't necessesarily want in my tent but wanted to keep dry. As soon as the rain started coming down a little harder (moderate, really) the tent started leaking all over...not something I could patch, just wasn't pulled tight enough. If you're camping in an area that you are sure won't have any rain, this is the tent for you."
3,"Tent OK, Odor NOT","The tent seems to be OK and a good value. But it must have been packed wet. I did a LOT of airing out, Lysolling, etc. to get rid of the mildew smell."
3,Not so dead deadman.,I got the product on time but upon further inspection I found that the rubber stopper didn't even come close to the top of the nozzle. I had to take the handle apart and redrill it so it would work. the dead man works fine now. I think Northern tool needs closer quality control instead of just putting it into a box and shipping it. I lost a hour and a half trying to fix it>Abrasive Blasting Deadman Valve Kit
1,too tight,"the leggings were totally different than I thought it would be. It's too tight and has no flexibility to stretch, which factors everyone would expect when buying a leggings. It was hard to put on, so it's almost abandoned and don't know when I'll be wearing that product. returning is a bit bothersome as well, so I don't know what to do with it. It's rather a panty hose with almost no elasticity in it."
5,"Great author, good books.","The long gap in DKM's writing has been one of those periods you notice. Some authors, if they just up and stopped, I probably wouldn't notice. With DKM's works, I've been waiting for him to get back into publication for years. I could say more, but if you like cyberpunk type stuff at all or near-future science fiction with a hard sf slant, pick up Emerald Eyes and go from there.With regard to this one, Last Dancer, it can be read stand-alone, but I really suggest starting with the first book in the series."
2,A VB Book on writing events,"This VB Book covers mostly events. There is no chapter on using the debug tool bar. Hey, lets write some code on VB, oops an error, how do I troubleshoot this code? hey look, no information on using the debug tool bar. I have read many books on VB, most of them are a BIG disappointment. The Mastering Series CD Roms from Microsoft are very good."
1,boring,the book was dull.the author gave you all the code so you didn't learn anything.programmers aren't spoon fed so how can you learn if that is what this book promotes.
5,Animal Communication,"Have reviewed some books and cds...I am looking to be able to telepathicaly communicate w/animals in case they need to communicate w/their care givers w/problems, pain etc. This book has the best by far information, directions, and meditations. I actually borrowed it from a friend at church and had to have my own copy. I also ordered the author's cds w/the meditations. It is absolutely amazing how this works :) I LOVE I!!!!!"
3,Accurate and informative but...,"I had initially purchased this book to add a ""moon chart"" reference book to my library of astrology books. Since then, I have refered to it many times to uncover moon signs of friends, family etc. I found that the combination moon/sun descriptions were relatively accurate, but had a difficult time interpreting this information for men. I must mention that I was terrible at ""English Lit,"" as it required reading between the lines. That fact should be considered when reading this review. Overall, I am pleased that I now have the reference material that I was looking for, but was hoping for more with regards to interpretations. Moon/Sun combinations are a nice start for beginners seeking to discover compatibility, but for a more detailed analysis, Venus and Mars should also be considered - which I have yet to find."
5,"Mr. Nevins, your work on Victoriana is a delight","Mr. Nevins has created what is now my favorite reference volume. I have many encylopedias and works of non-fiction that I use for reference, his is the first I read for the sheer joy of it.Mr. Nevins has gathered information on characters both famous and forgotten and turned the result into an informative and fascinating look into the literature of a bygone age. His work has inspired me to look into works of the Victoria age I had previously bypassed. I look forward to reading any future works Mr. Nevins and have since ordered his previously published books."
4,Nice Sampling of Bach's Orchestral Works . . .,"There's more to Bach's repertoire than solo organ and violin works, and this Sony release aptly demonstrates his versatility as a composer. Besides the Brandenburg Concertos, Bach wrote many concertos, cantatas, and sinfonias for orchestra. This disc, which offers but a sampling of Bach's orchestral works, includes both ADD/DDD recordings. True, as with other ADD recordings, I can hear the background hiss (not unusual with older rocordings) on certain pieces. Fortunately, this noise is not distracting (just slightly noticeable), and in no way detracts from the performance of these pieces. Overall, a fine recording that speaks to the greatness of Bach. After listening to this disc, I hope you will be inspired to seek out other recordings of orchestral works by Bach (many of which are also at bargain prices)."
2,Grown-ups encouraged to try the real thing,"OK: I admit it. I own Wagner orchestral recordings. I don't have the courage to face up to 140 hours of screeching to get the odd beautiful moment. But eliminating the human voice from a Bach cantata is like drinking beer in Church. I know a lot of good artists have done it. But there are folks out there that have never HEARD a real Bach Cantata, even if they are familiar with some of the extraordinary meodies that Bach spun out. They are cheating themselves. Maybe 18th Century Luthern pietism is hard to find now. However, religion has generated splendid art through the ages and Bach's cantatas are about at the top of an extraordinary category of human creation. Do yourself a favor: look up any cantata on this present collection and get a real live copy of it - choir, solists and all. A music lover would."
3,Pretty but not practical.,"I loved just flipping through the book but after reading about actually getting started and putting it together... too complicated for me! Like other reviewers, I found that the lack of rotary cutter directions, templates sans seam allowances, and less than clear directions for piecing to be insurmountable problems for any but experienced, confident quilters. It is a beautiful book and very inspiring, though, so my recommendation is this: don't pass up the opportunity to check this one out at the library. Then watch for it to go on clearance and get a copy for yourself!"
4,A great motivator.,"This book is a really great motivator. I am a novice at quilting : I am currently on my fifth one. Most of the quilts I have done were pretty simple designs and this book challenged me with more complex patterns. It has inspired me to create some interesting variations. I admit that the instructions are a bit confusing, but overall I think everyone can benefit from it. The blocks vary from very simple to complex. From beginners to experts, this one has something for us all......"
2,Poor recording (re-mastering),"I totally agree with R. Scott Richter, but i think it`s the recording (or better re-mastering) who makes this album sound bad, i have more albums of other singers who are RE-MASTERED and they all sounded bad in comparing with the original, this is my first album from Eva Cassidy, so i can not compare it with the original recordings.The music though is very good, so the two stars are just for the quality of the recording (re-mastering)."
2,wrong poster,"They sent me a Kramer poster but not this one. It was the correct size, they just sent me the one without the quote along the bottom, which was the main reason for me buying that one in the first place. I'm making a long trip home this weekend for father's day and since this is a father's day gift, there's no time to get a replacement."
5,Pleased,"Very well condition, came on time. Overall pleased with the purchase. Also my girfriend is terrified of him haha"
3,I EXPECTED MORE PICTURES...,"DON'T GET ME WRONG, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. BUT I WOULD'VE EXPECTED MORE PICTURES AND LESS TALK, THE AUTHOR TALKS IN SUCH A WAH THAT SOMETIMES YOU GET LOST IN THE READINGS AND RATHER MIND YOUR OWN BY LOOKING AT THE AMAZING ARTWORK."
5,One of the best art books I own.,"This is an amazing book, not only for fans of Pink Floyd, but for anyone who's interested in photography or surreal art. The text is entertaining and gives a lot of insight into the creative and production process, and some amusing anecdotes as well."
3,Disappointing,"Well, I am going to go out on a limb and say that I found the book disappointing. Maybe that just shows my preference for an all-around guide that covers many subjects. I felt that most of the information was already available in other guides. However, since seeing the excellent reviews given here, I will be re-reading the book to try to find out what I missed!"
3,Gagaku (Japanese Imperial Court Music),"This CD was generally a great learning experience of Japanese music culture. I am a Japanese language student at an University, this CD was part of the learning material. Honestly at first, Gagaku surprised me. I was not expecting the music I first initially heard. But once I started to actually listen to the music, I found out that is was more complicated the more I listened. Overall, this Gagaku is an excellent way to learn just how complicated historical Japanese music really is."
4,Not bad,"Danielpour is a brilliant craftsman and a fine writer. My only criticism of the album is that the two pieces tend to run together and are a bit indistinct from one another. He truly has a gift, but needs to push himself before lapsing into repetitiveness."
3,Interesting,"I've read Princess 1 and 2 and they both were good. This book didn't move me, it was slow and a bit on the boring side. Kenya seemed like a smart woman but come on if your man stays out late all the time and you can't get in touch with him, best believe he is up to no good. Why she couldn't see this I don't know on top of that her friends were telling her he was playing around. The story just seemed so unreal and drawn out. However, I will continue to buy Rakyyah's books because I like her writing except for this one."
3,A little on the cheap side,But it seems to do what it is supposed to in an emergency. I'll try it out later and hope for the best.
4,Weiss is great,"Weiss is great. OK not the most brilliant of the period but of sufficient class to have JC Bach, his chum, walk off with some of the thought and reissue it for harpsichord, without changing too much. Still as early music goes, almost an unending joy. Barto does a great job. Volume 1 in the seires is very good as well. If you can, find the CD of Sonate for 2 liuti, bliss."
4,Great Book If you have a teacher helping you.,"This book is great if you have a teacher who is helping you. If you are trying to go through this book by yourself you will probably fail and become frustrated with the guitar. I do not recommend you use this book by yourself if you are starting out. Otherwise I love this book. I have a good instructor and I am learning alot. The book does not have tabs so you will be forced to read music (which is good) but harder. Buy the book with the CD so you can hear how the songs are played. I would have liked to see him include a DVD so that every musical section can be heard by the student, this is especially helpful to know if you are playing each section correctly and for the student who is trying to learn on their own."
3,ok in the Winter - miserable in the Summer,"I got this when I was working in the winter at a zoo because as I drove home the snow melted off my clothes and soaked and dirtied my seat. This kept my seat dry and clean but when summer rolled around it was a miserable seat cover. It doesn't breathe at all so I found myself stuck to my seat with my own sweat, and I am do not sweat very much in general. Certainly not something I would buy for warmer weather but it worked for my winter needs."
3,"Adequate,.Tuff to fit",There was no indication that they are not a pair. It wasn't until I received the ONE did I relies that they are NOT SOLD IN PARES. Thanks' guys I appreciate that.POOR Customer Service
3,Does NOT fit Honda CRZ 2011 seats,"The cover does not fit Honda CRZ seats - it's basically too short on the back and I have no idea how they expect anyone to be able to do up the velcro strap that goes UNDER the seat in almost any modern vehicle. That part of the seat is completely inaccessible these days. So you can't secure the cover to the bottom or 'seat' of the chair - you just have to rely on the elastic around the edges to hold it on. Having said that, it's still better than having to drag a towel around with me to keep sweat and chorinated water off the seat this summer. We'll see just how long it lasts - possibley only as long as the summer season. Wouldn't buy it again though."
4,Very pleased with the filter,"Shopped around for a few weeks before settling on this filter. It was not too difficult to make the plumbing connections. Once it was installed it did a great job of filtering my pool water. I think my pool is cleaner with the cartridge filter over the old sand filter. I also found that since it is moving water so much more efficiently, I can reduce reduce running my pump to 8-10 hours per day instead of 11-12 which saves money."
1,Duplicate of Earlier Series,"Be careful in selecting this Series 7 & 8...it is a repeat of earlier series and Amazon does not give you the individual episodes so you cannot ckeck against earlier series you may have....it's a ""rip off"""
5,An Amazing return for veteran punk stars,"I heard this song on the radio a few weeks ago and haven't been able to get it out of my mind since. It's got that great feel of early Clashcombined with an upbeat and positive message that the 70's punks would never have put out. Anyway, ""The News"" for Carbon Silicone is very good, this is an absolutely perfect song."
3,Too slow paced to be really funny,"I liked it, but it felt slow as I watched it. I especially enjoyed all the fake porn movie names. I don't regret it."
2,Well its ok,"I expected to see a movie, the first few minutes looked like a documentary. I had to fast forward to the actual ""movie"" part. Its basically a mock documentary and behind the scenes. I have to admit it had some funny moments, but unfortunately i was half asleep by the time the funny parts began."
4,Re-Issue!,The reason why this is a re-issue was due to the high demand & not on extra content! This is an exact copy of the previous release. The previous release went OOP so fast that people were selling them at a ridiculously high price! At least I can purchase this now for less than 30 imported to the UK other than 80+!!
5,great little grill,I bought this little baby to keep in my camper to use at campgrounds that dont have good grills. I bought a concrete paver to sit it in on. It gets really hot. It is a perfect sweet little grill it holds heat great and is simply fantastic. Easy to clean and can cook quit a bit of food. We are a family of six. I have to cook more than one round of meat on it and the charcoal will just keep going. Could not be happier with it. If you like charcoal buy it. If you take care of it will last forever.
5,Awesome little grill!,"I love this little guy! I previously only had a gas grill and wanted a good charcoal grill. After reading many reviews I decided on this one. I love the look of it and it's fun to cook on. My old gas grill works as a perfect surface to cook on as well as store this hibachi in to keep it out of the elements. The only negative I can think of is it's hard to cook hot dogs / sausages on as they want to roll off. In my case if they do, they just land on the old gas grill grates below so it's not the end of the world. I think I've used this more times in the past couple of weeks than my gas grill all last year. Better flavor than cooking over gas and a better experience overall! BTW Amazon had the best price by far!"
5,great grill,"great grill,easy to controll heat,can cook with little charcole easy clean up,love it! and its total cast iron,should last a few life times,so i can pass it on to my sons.davec"
5,25 years of use,"I have a slightly older model of this grill. They didn't ""pre-season"" cast iron in the '80s and it looks like they've made a cosmetic change or two but I've had the same basic model for over 25 years. It is heavy and it does get hot (put it on a paver or a concrete surface) If you need to adjust the vent use tongs because the slider gets hot, too. The only maintenance I've ever done is to empty out the ash and brush with a whisk broom. I've worn out a couple of brooms but the cast iron looks like it will last longer than I will. About once a year I rub a little oil on the thing but that's it.If the new model is anywhere half as good as the one I've got, buy it !!! I also own a Big Green Egg and a Weber but this is what I prefer for a small cook. I highly recommend it."
5,Awesome Grill,"This one lives up to the hype. Chicken,steak,shrimp,burgers and dogs all cook great on this grill. Looks just as good as it cooks. Fire door does swing free but it is not a deal breaker for me. Pull the trigger on this one, you will not be disappointed."
3,Nice Hibachi - but,"This is a really nice hibachi - very functional, easy to clean, holds heat & great for searing. The only downside is Lodge's unfortunate decision to cast their logo smack dab in the middle or the grilling surface. This creates a rather large medallion in the middle of the work area. Lay a large steak on it and you'll have an area that is a solid sear and lacking grill marks - not to mention uneven cooking relative to the rest of the area. If you don't need the area you can always manage your work to either side. I have found myself cutting a large sirloin in half to avoid the need to use the center area as cooking temperature is not as even on the logo as it is over the rest of the cooking area. Whoever in design or marketing thought of this logo placement should be coached on practical use of cooking equipment - obviously they are not well schooled in grilling. Really spoils an otherwise great product."
4,Cops on the Take!,"Carlotta Carlyle from A TROUBLE WITH FOOLS, gets stuck with a none functioning bathroom, her little sister in Columbia, a mentor who makes the papers as a crooked cop and a young teen who finds life on the streets preferable to home.A fine continuance for a budding detective who knows no other way than to keep plugging away until all the layers of Boston sleaze are stripped away. Into her life comes Sam, an old flame but balanced by Lt. Mooney who needs a friend against his own kind who intend to destroy his testimony before Internal Affairs. Complicated personal relationships move this second entry and make a smooth read. Enjoy Charlotte and The Brothers who owe her roommate a favor.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,"If you love Barbra, you'll love this book!",This book is very funny and very sexy. It will show you a young side of Barbra that you havn't seen before.
4,works,"i rated 4 stars, since it works, but without 6 months of data,I am unable to provide long term results. So far the UV lamp is on been on 24 /7 since i got it back in September 2011). I have bubble, and hair algae out break, in my nano reef tank- trying to stop it spreading- at least. When you first turn it on it takes 5 seconds or more to turn on, then it ignites. I cannot provide spectrum data or such, but my hair and bubble algae have diminished 85%. I would recommend on price and value only. So I give this a solid 4. I'm harsh at giving reviews, as you can tell."
5,Back to the Basics,"Many parts of this book have the potency of Whitfield's Healing the Child Within and A Gift to Myself. Within this volume, there are reminders of what attracted many to Whitfield's writings when he first appeared on the landscape of the human potential movement almost 20 years ago. Charles was already modeling Humility in his written, audio and visual works back then. This book contains enough nourishing resource to make it worth the while."
3,sturgeon fishing,"A pretty good book. It could have used more specific details and covered more rigging.The cartoons are fun.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY THATS FOR SURE!,"Got the book, read it! Surely not worth its price! I own a lot of fish and fishing books so I would have to say, this book isnt worth its cost! Most of the information wasn't as detail and I found better information from just searching websites on the net."
1,Waste of your money,"This is a very poorly designed sprayer. As soon as the liquid drops below the level of the intake from the hose (which is near the top), you begin to pump air instead of whatever you put in it.I had to tip the whole thing on it's side and pump at the same time to get the liquid in the hose to spray.Even when it was working right, the sprayer is not that even."
2,"Nice style, nice color... but cheap quality",I like the style and the color but the quality is just cheap.This one is a return.
3,Salton Sea Not So Much,All Salton Sea documentaries are more inhabitant centric but this one more than mostfocuses on less area and really delves into a couple of specific families. It's not a badsideline for those with interest in SS but not exactly what I was hoping for.
4,Cute,"I luv bleach, so I had to personalize. Patch is very durable. Will last a long, long time. Would purchase more, if different ones are available."
5,TRACK LISTINGS,"""CONTAINS 6 VERSIONS""RADIO EDITROLLING STONE MIXINSTRUMENTALACCAPPELLAOLD SCHOOL MIXLONG VERSION"
4,Decent syringe case,"This is a decent syringe case that does the job. The only thing I wish were different is if the two slots that hold the wings of the syringe were offset a little more. Sometimes, depending on how much insulin is in the syringe, it is difficult to get the plunger to fit between the tabs that are meant to keep the plunger from moving. If I could simply use the other set of wings to get a 1/2 offset with respect to the tabs, that would have made it perfect."
2,Highly Over priced,These probably cost 25 cents to make. They do the job but are way over priced for what you get.
3,Resident Evil Zero Hour,The book I read was Resident Evil and it was a ok book. The things I liked about the book was that it gave good descriptions and it was pretty interesting to read. The book also made you wanna keep reading so that you could find out what happened next. Overall it was a pretty good book. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to read horror books.
4,King of Kings,"A very polished recording with ambitious intent...He is telling you to worship GOD and also making a musical statement. A very multi-talented, multiple instrument artist. Even if you are not a religious person you can appreciate the drive and motivation he puts into his music...for whatever reason he records it..."
5,"Melodious, Moving and Monumental!","While I love modern film scores with the wild action sequences (Hans Zimmer, etc), there is something so amazing when you find a score that plays out like a classical symphony. This score to the film ""Hamlet"" is just such a score. The music is melodious, moving and monumental. I highly recommend this!"
5,Alanna is amazing!,"I fell in love with Alanna right away. The whole while you'rereading you find yourself in another world. Pierce has written anunbelievable novel with adventure, love, and excitement. Once you read the first Alanna book you have to read the rest! If you buy this book I find it hard to believe that you won't love it!"
5,Wonderful!,"I LOVE the Alanna series! They are the best books in the whole world! I got hooked on all of Mrs. Pierce's books when I read this one. I am an avid reader, and I know a good book from a bad one, and her books are WONDERFUL! If you don't have anything to read, my advice is to pick up one of these and you won't stop reading. Trust me-YOU WILL GET HOOKED!"
4,Great introduction to a fabulous series,"Even though people complain that this is the least interesting book of the quartet, I have always thought that the introduction to Alanna's adventures was interesting and really good. I loved getting to meet the characters and I thought the scene in the Black City was particularly fascinating. Great book!!"
5,The Best Series Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I read this book in third grade and was imediatley hooked and have now read all of Tamora Pierces books but the Circle of Magic. This series is my favorite series ever and I love Alanna and George. Tortall is a world I would love to live in!!!
5,5 Stars for Alana: The First Adventure,"Alana: The First Adventure is a wonderful read for any fantasy fan! The plot is interesting, exciting, and very original, along with providing a very strong female character. It also leaves a nice opening for the books to come. Anyone who enjoys fantasy at all needs to read this book! Tow thumbs up!"
5,ThiS is the BEST book In the Whole World!!!!!,"When i got this book, i couldnt put it down for even a minute!!!I finished it it a few hours!!Alanna is really an inspiring character, and kinda reminds me of me. Its intriguing and full of adventure.I read Song of the Lioness Quartet and The Immortals, I really recommend these two series to readers. I luv the Lioness series so much that i can read them 100 times over.!"
3,I thought the book was good.,"This book has its exciting moments and its boring ones.Alanna, the main character has a never ending determination and is persistant. I enjoyed reading this book as I like books with an old time setting. Alanna, a supposed boy turns out as a girl but only Jonathan and Coram know. I give this book a three star rating."
2,T''was Okay...I suppose,"It was an alright book, for a bit of light reading. I'm twelve and I like fantasy novels, but this one didn't really do what it could have done. It had a lot of potential, but hasn't done anything about it. Hopefully the 2nd, 3rd and if I could be bothered by then 4th book will have more of a storyline. I would DEFINATELY reccomend this book if you are prepared to read the other books in the series before you get a storyline. So, really, it was a great introductory book."
4,"I loved these when I was a teenager, and they still entertain.","I really enjoyed this whole series. I read it when I was about 13, and devoured the whole series in a few days. But, now that I'm a mom, I don't think I'd let my kids read it-- it has been a while since I've read them, but I think I recall that the author has the whole ""casual sex is cool, just don't get pregnant"" type of mentality that Mercedes Lackey also writes about-(I also love Mercedes Lackey, I've re-read her Talia/Vanyel/Kerowyn/Tarma & Kethry books more times than I can count), and it's a mentality that I don't want my daughters exposed to until they are old enough to understand that Mommy and Daddy say that's WRONG (Buffy flashback, anyone? The episode where Faith took over Buffy's body?? Anyone??)"
4,Tamora writes like a godess herself!,"I only gave this book 4 stars because the beginning is sort of boring, but it gets better towards the end! Tamora has created a book full of magic and wonder. A migical world packed with scorcery, warrior princesses, strange creatures, and heart stopping battles with evil spirits. This book will be sure to catch your attention....at least, more towards the end."
4,Strong Women Rock,"This was an awsome book...I love books which have strong female leads. To hear about men all the time just irritates me so I was very pleased to see a woman rock the future!Alanna was a great book, full of adventure and magic and mystery...I really loved it and I think it is a great book for girls these days because girl need role models who are strong and independant like Alanna...not skanky and trashy like Brittany Spears.BW~"
5,"Wonderful,inticing!","This whole Quartet was wonderful.Alanna is a fascinating main character,and far from bland.She not only has a good personality,a famous temper,and purple eyes-she's got a fighter's spirit.This book was,I believe,my favorite out of the quartet.The fourth was my second favorite,the second my third,and the third my fourth. It seems alot of people are complaining about the ""love scenes"" in these books,and the ""simplicity"" of it all.I disagree.Totally.Alanna wasn't always looking forward to romance and love.In fact,she's somewhat nervous about it.I can relate to that^_^. The ""sex"" scenes in it are not nearly as bad as some I have seen.If you want romance,read a romance book.If you want action,read an action/drama book,etc. If you can't handle both,then this is not a series for you....But I absolutely loved it!"
5,I love Alanna!,"She's brave, she wants to be a knight and she has very strong powers with the Gift. Who is she? Alanna! Alanna must use her skills and test her bravery to save her Prince and and earn her shield. Whether she's fighting a fellow page or ancient monsters, Alanna's got what it takes!I loved this book, and I recommend it to everyone. If you like this book, be sure to read 'In the Hand of the Goddess', the second book in the 'Song of the Lioness' Quartet.I love all of Ms. Pierce's books especially 'In the Hand of the Goddess' and In the Relms of the Gods' (The 4th book in the Immortals Quartet)Please read all of them!"
5,great,loved this book as a kid and still do! it's definitely for a younger audience but it's a great book for young girls
4,"great shelf, pain to put together","The directions were poorly done, but the shelves are great and well worth it... Once you build one, the next one is easier. Be sure you are putting the top and bottom in the right places and facing the right way - other than that the rest should go ok. The bottom board has a small ""skirt"" piece that blocks things from going under it - it also helps with stability. Just make sure the bottom board is correctly positioned, so that skirt piece can be put in correctly.These are sturdy and well priced. We have them holding bins of toys for my kid :)"
3,Its was a great one time thing!,"i recently purchased this item for my daughters 8th birthday. i read review befor buying. I cannot fins a replace for it so until i do it had been a one time thing. Its in a small plastic case which could break if treated roughly. Requires some adult supervision, is a great idea for girls! needs more replacement lip gloss stuff too!!!! overall, im sure my daughter would have been estatic if we could have done more!"
4,"excellent review of Canal's history, function and lifestyle","I am using this book to research my Civil War novel, which takes place, in part, along the Canal. The book has proven quite valuable both for its medium-detail history, and for its first-hand descriptions of the Canal's function, and the lives of Canal families. (The Canal functioned in much the same manner throughout its history, so the first-hand accounts provide a good window to earlier days.)The book is well-written, clearly a labor of love for the Maryland author. It is a good historical source, and a fun read for those planning a visit to the Canal (now a National Historical Park.) There are also some funny, sad and astonishing anecdotes, giving the reader a good ""feel"" for the lives of the Canal folk.Paul M. BauerBelmont, MA"
3,To Have And To Hold,I've read other books by Fern Michaels and this one was just ok. I thought that it was slow moving and I was glad when I finished it-not one of my favorites by this author.
5,Uncovers the mystery of SQL's behavior,"I like this book. I was looking for a book that gave the ""why"" behind SQL. I graduated years ago with a Computer Science degree and didn't have the opportunity to take a database class. I found myself having to learn SQL on the job. This book uncovers the mystery of SQL's behavior. It has a lot of examples that are supported by the software described in the appendix. It also describes how to use the query languages of Microsoft Access.Don't let the term ""theory"" scare you. After the first couple of pages of required definitions, the tone of the book quickly changed to a very readable presentation. Overall, I like the writing style - it's precise and to the point - not too wordy. Definitely worth the money!"
4,an insight,"I was never very fond of Terry Waite because I was more interested in the other hostages and their writings.However, I was fond of Robert Runcie and this book gave an interesting insight to the various journeys across the world that they have to undertake and the pressures they are under."
2,Too grim for me,"I picked this book up while working my way through the Granta list of top writers.It is well-written and harrowing, but the unrelenting grimness of it all wore on me. I had a hard time finishing the book.I'd like to see at least a few rays of hope and light.Bill Chance"
3,Family Bible,"The Bible came new & nice except on the beginning pages where you write who it was given by, your marriage date, etc. the print was almost too light to see. I thought perhaps this co. was selling defective-print Bibles & thats why price was $30 instead of $50 in store. I had no time to call or return it because it was a wedding present & the wedding was Feb. 4."
1,Kinkade is Evil,Thomas Kinkade is under investigation by the FBI. He intentionally bankrupted many people due to his own greed. Keep this tainted document out of your families home.
1,unhappy result,My TV stopped working after less than 3 months (convientiently 2 weeks past the 90 day labor warranty). To get it fixed I would have to pay at least $150 in labor and shipping on a TV that cost less than $300. What a racket!! How could I ever trust another Sharp product after this experience. What has happened to product quality?
4,A typical Dover,"If one is unfamiliar with Dover Thrift editions, be warned that they are not meant for the seriously interested. Rather, they are meant to provide cheap introductions for beginners or slim volumes for those who wish to appear intellectual. They are also just another volume to collect for (in this case) Poe completists. That having been said, I love Dover thrift editions precisely because they are so cheap and provide easy access to the most famous works by reknowned authors. This particular volume delivers, including both Poe's most famous works of poetry (The Raven, Annabel Lee, The Bells, etc.) and some less-well-known works."
1,do not waste your money,"THIS AXIS HT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY IT DID NOTHING FOR ME AT ALL. I HIGHLY DOUBT IT WILL DO JACK FOR YOU TOO. ALL MY FRIENDS THAT TOOK IT GOT ZERO RESULTS FROM IT. BSN HAS GOOD PRODUCTS LIKE SYNTHA 6 AND N.O. EXPLODE, BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HECK THEY WERE THINKING WHEN THEY PUT THIS STUFF OUT THERE, I FEEL USED............"
5,Really good singing,"Dennis Lambert has a beautiful voice, perfect diction (on the order of Karen Carpenter) and his songs are very appealing. I find myself listening to them over and over, although I don't like all of them equally. The arrangements are dated and nostalgic, and I hear strains of Burt Bacharach, Carole King, Barry Manilow, and others in his music.I really like this CD. This man had a really fine voice. I am sorry he is no longer with us."

3,Fact or fiction?,"I had trouble putting this book down after I started reading it. The thing that stands out is the lurid detail that the author goes into. This is not your average, sanitized first-hand account of the Vietnam War.If you're looking for a book that captures the gist of being a medic, conscientious objector, and soldier in Vietnam, this is the book. Its entertaining, the characters are likeable, and the storyline contains very few slow spots.However, I am giving this book only 3 stars for a reason. There are a couple of coincidences in the book that I believe the author created with his artistic license. Number one is Ben meeting up with Buckshot on the battlefield after both had been left for dead. Number two is visiting the Vietnam Memorial and running into a person copying the name of the person whom Ben let die. Theres a few other unplausible situations that I'm starting to doubt the authenticity of."
2,Podrían ser más armónicos.,"Existen mejores sonidos, sonidos arm'nicos que en realidad adem's de ponernos a saltar nos digan algo. Considero a Locomotora una desfachatez. Como si fuera que en el Rock en Espa'ol no hubieran grupos que pongan la pauta de un sonido arm'nico, de unas letras que puedan ser de amor, de protesta o de rumba de altura.Hace falta una revisi'n de gustos, no fanatismos hacia alguien que no muestra en la realidad lo mejor, que no posea la calidad"
3,crosswords,this is a brain worker. I thought it would be more like the NYT monday crosswords that are edited by Will Shortz. more along the lines of a wed or thurs instead. I'll give it to my mom.
1,Not a Monday!,I love the NYT puzzles but do not do well past Wednesday. I looked forward to having a book of puzzles around all the time but was very disappointed with this book. This is not for Monday or Tuesday level solvers!!! They are far more difficult and as another reviewer stated very demoralizing. I want some challenge but not be left staring. There are far better books. Go look for them.
1,Only Purchase From Reputable Yankee Sellers!,"There's nothing wrong with Yankee candles themselves, but there's something wrong with this one for sure. As other reviewers said, the scent isn't as strong as it was in the store. Also, when I received my candle the wax shifted over the wick and was unusable.Easily fixed: Just purchase your candles in the store. It doesn't cost much more (considering shipping), and you know what you're paying for."
1,pin holes,"I purchased three of the hoses in march of 2012, by december of 2012 they were full of pin holes and i am stuck with a hose that does not live up to it's billing, do not buy this product ,and amazon should remove the itiem from it's website."
1,Worthless after 2nd use,"Worked fine during the first use but on the very second use, it wouldn't couple well with the spigot and gushed water everywhere.Also it kinks, so don't buy this expecting it to be kink-free as they claim. That wasn't a dealbreaker by itself, but I had to return it since it was spewing water no matter how hard I tightened it."
1,Huge waste of money,"Utterly disappointed with this product. The hose kinks constantly. What a joke. The walls of the hose are so flimsy. I didn't expect first class quality for the price, but I was expecting at least average performance and didn't even get that."
4,Gets the job done,"The 8 ply Flexogen (5/8"") is a staple for me, I have one on the backyard hose reel and it's lasted many years. So I decided to get another for the front yard. Since I was ""cheap"" I opted for the 1/2"" size; it doesn't have the pressure behind it that the 5/8"" has, so next time, if I ever replace it, I'll get the larger size. The 1/2"" size is fine for washing the car, watering plants and hosing off the walks, etc., but that's about all, I don't think it would be the best for pressure washing."
1,Green covering and the body separated and puff up,Was defective - Actually one no star for this hose is more appropriate. Water got between the green covering and the body of the hose causing it to separate and puff up in several places and leaks sprung from each puff up. I'm returning today and have ask for a refund and not to be replace with this hose.
1,Leaked,This hose leaked. Maybe all don't but mine did. It was too short but that was my fault. I didn't measure right.
1,Bad quality hose,"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase this brand. Much to my disappointment, the quality on this hose is non-existent. After using it for a few weeks, the hose began to bulge in many places."
4,little pricey,"my old garden hose finally leaked after almost ten years of use. it did kink a lot.i got this gilmour flexogen hose from amazon. at first look, it is softer but not as strong as i would expect.the picture looks better than the actual item. amazon has a fair price, but if i buy again, i will hunt for cheaper."
1,WARNING - TOXIC hose - contains LEAD - needs to be removed from Amazon,"You really need to read the fine print, but shouldn't have to. There should be a giant warning on this product. The brass fittings on this hose contain lead which CAUSES CANCER and BRAIN DAMAGE. I found out by reading a tiny note on the back of the cardboard cover of this product when it arrived. I was going to use it for watering my vegetable garden and would have been ingesting lead. THIS HOSE SHOULD BE BANNED and the manufacturer is liable for known serious health damages."
3,Definately for older children,"This book is beautifully illustrated and written but was given to my daughter when she was 4 years old by an ambitious uncle and although she is quite interested in science, at age 5 it is still way over her head. I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers, I would recommend it for much older children interested in the subject."
2,"Nice Artwork, Misleading History","This children's book about Galileo has very beautiful illustrations, but the history leaves much to be desired. It's a perfect example though of how myths about the past take on a life of their own independent of historical evidence or historical context. Sis offers another variation on the ""warfare"" of science versus religion with Galileo representing the modern rational scientist (which he was not) and his opponents in the Church representing ignorant, dogmatic tradition. Of course the reality was much more complex, especially considering that Galileo did not have proof that the earth moved. This book shows why children are so often misinformed from an early age for the sake of telling a good story."
3,"weird, fantastic, for a select group of ""knowers""","As I am a great fan, no, not fan, person who REALLY appreciates Elliot's music, this is a special one even to me, but nevertheless, magnificant piece of work in his context. I would really love to see the play in its whole. This is Art with a big ""A"". Definately my cup of tea"
5,NEWS FLASH: Neopets is Stuck in Cards!,"I have had many hours of fun playing with myself with these cards, despite I being an adult, I have no other people to play with. This is fun, and is hard to bend (or break) the cards unless you try to. I belive parents and children alike should buy this toy.There are different rarities of card, such as the Common cards, the Rare cards, the Uncommon cards, and the Holographic Rare cards. It has characters from the online site 'Neopets', such as Lord Darigan, and made up ones who are not in the site, such as Siyanna of Taldor. Overall, I'd give this toy a 4.5. And the artwork is pretty."
1,not to educational its violent,it is a battling game my kid try to fight but i get them in trouble so im not going to let them buy the cards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Great cartoons, but censored","This video contains some of my all time personal favorite cartoons, most of which you just can't see on television anymore. However, much like the cartoons on television the ones on this video have also been censored (although to a lesser degree). For example, in ""Droopy's Good Deed"" there is one gag that ends abruptly at the very moment the dynamite blows up in Spike's face. I found this dissapointing because I expected a commercial release of this material to be in its original form instead of hacked up by PC censors. All in all its a great video however and I would highly recommend it."
2,Dislike,"LEGO Harry Potter Flying Lessons (4711)is not the product I invisioned it to be from what I observed on Amazon. It arrived in a small 4 inch x 4 inch box containing 21 small pieces, priced at $56.67. In my mind this was not a good value. Now I am having a problem getting a refund."
3,Should have read the fine print,"This costume is fun and cute. We also liked the price, but the photo is deceiving. It does not include the wings."
2,so so,"The dress design is ok, but the quality is cheap, it is pretty much look-through and the halo is very cheap quality, very easy to bend over and break."
2,Go for another one,Initially for the first two months it was okay but later one handset is giving lots of noise even when we are next to the base. And the phone doesnot have low ring setting. I have a baby and its really frustating whenever the phone rings with such a loud voice.
4,"overall, good phone especially for the price","I was going to buy this phone at Target, but they were all out, so I ordered it from Amazon. I received it quickly and was up and calling within 24 hours. I am happy with the reception and overall performance of the product. When I am on the far side of my house, I do experience some static, but it's much better than my prior Uniden 900mhz set."
2,huge disappointment,"I had an Epson LQ570 that was a real gem. It had amazing print quality and lasted for several years until my computer became obsolete. My kids wanted an HP photo printer so I tried one but was disappointed. After I tried a couple of other brands I bought an Epson R320. It takes a long time to start printing. It goes through a long period of wierd sounds, then it appears to go dead. after a long silent period it finally prints.Recently we had a power outage. There was no surge, the substation just went down. Today I tried to use it and it won,t recognize the ink cartridges that have been in there for a couple of months. There is a long list of annoyances that I won't bother to list.It used to be that if you bought a certain brand of equipment you could expect a certain level of quality throughout that product line. The world of electronics is a very different place. Caveat Emptor!"
2,"If you want it for desktop publishing, DON'T BUY IT","I replaced my old Epson Stylus with this and was extremely disappointed in its ability to interface with desktop publishing programs such as Quark and InDesign. I should have researched it more thoroughly, but anyone looking to do anything more creative than print out pictures should NOT get this model. It is also an ink-guzzler (with more cartridges to buy!), and is very finicky about what types of media it will print on. Graphic artists beware."
2,Ink almost costs more than the printer!,"Yes, yes the printer works great and especially for the price. What is never mentioned is that the ink is contained in 6 special cartriges that hold barely a teaspoon of ink. At Office Depot I recently paid $110 just for the ink. Once the ink runs out this time its going in the trash."
3,"Quality, but small","I use the top partition to hold bills. It need about another 1/4"" to really hold the envelopes. The drawer is deep - great for stamps and return address stickers."
2,To Easy!,"I asked for this set for Christmas, thinking there was more to it than what you see on Amazon; I was wrong. It has only 23 pieces, and it only took me like five minutes to put together! The only upside is that it is very durable, and it wood be good for ages 5-7."
3,Losing the Woman in the Details,"Ridley provides an excellent overview of Elizabeth's reign, but he spends precious little time with the Queen and her court. I recommend reading this book in tandem with Alison Weir's ""The Life of Elizabeth I."" Together they provide a fuller picture of the Queen and her times than either book does individually."
5,tractor,My grandson loves this toy and plays with it all the time. Well worth the money I paid for it . very pleased with this purchase these reviews need to be shorted
3,Its ok,My Grandson loves it. I thought it would be bigger in size. I like the way the animal sounds are not loud and blaring.
2,Does not include basic information,"Basic Knit? This book assumes that everyone magically knows how to do every knitting technique imaginable. If you are a beginner, don't waste you're money on this book."
4,"Nice Quality, but a little pricey","These were of very nice quality, the non-skid bottoms were good, but they were a little pricey. I had a discount, otherwise would probably not have paid the original price for them."
5,REMARKABLE!!!!!,"Unless you need a set with lids, this is the only way to go! The bowls are heavy duty. The rubber on the handle helps hold the bowl while mixing thick substances. The rubber on the bottom is INCREDIBLE! I LOVE these bowls!"
3,The Marx's Celluloid Tombstone,"By 1950, the Marx Brothers were too old and tired. By this time, their bits were stale. Groucho only makes ""cameo"" appearances at the beginning and the end of the movie. Harpo and Chico are not all that funny. This film primarily showcased a young Marilyn Monroe to the world. Other than that, this film has nothing going for it. But, as one reviewer said; old, tired Marx Brothers are better than no Marx Brothers at all. So, I gave this film three stars for Groucho, Harpo, and Chico. Harpo and Chico will go on tour to showcase their musical talents. Groucho will eventually become the host of a very popular quiz game and will also be the guest host of the Tonight Show. As a matter of fact, Groucho introduced Johnny Carson as the ""new host"" of the Tonight Show. Although this film was a failure, the Brothers were still talented and entertaining in their own right."
2,HOW SAD,that the studio couldn't afford to shoot (or release) this in color. The talents of the delightful Vera-Ellen are hidden under a bushel.
3,Okay,This movie was okay.Groucho was in the movie only 30% of the time and Chico and Harpo are in the movie for 70% of the time so most of the laughs come from Chico and Harpo.This movie was funny but not as good as Duck Soup or A Night in Casablanca
2,Disappointing,"I love Amy Tan, but this book was so disappointing. The premise was odd and fictional (portrayed as truth). While the narrator was at time humorous, the pace was slow and the characters dull and unlikeable. I was hoping for at least some more insight into life in Asia, but again was disappointed. I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,Look under the surface at the poor fish!,"The novel is readable, and to a certain extent, enjoyable as a spoof. But what about the fate of the Karen tribe described in the novel? Their treatment under the Myanmar military was horrific! And their fate at the end of the book is ambiguous. They are never heard from again, having gone to Someplace Else. Are they alive? Under what circumstances? This is the real tragedy under the surface of the spoof. So the tourists all got back safely and had predictable lives. So what?"
1,Please drown this book,"I was so excited to buy Amy Tan's new book. I love and have even reread her other books but this was awful. In fact, half way through I stopped to check if it was the same author that I loved! It was a HUGE disppointment! Don't waste your money on it."
3,Great Start but Fizzles at the End,"I've read all of Amy Tan's books. She's very talented and I was glad she ventured out of her usual mother-daugher angst to try something different. The first 2/3 of the book were really good but it just ran out of gas at the end. The ending seemed like a slapped-on, feel good, Disney denouement which was disappointing."
2,I didn't like the story at all. It took too long to get into the characters and the story.,"I would recommend it to readers who like fantasy with losts of characters. and, a story the roams around before it gets to the point if it does."
2,Save a Fish from Drowning,I love her past works as Amy Tan novels are awesome and the story stays with me for years. The Bone Cutter's Daughter and Kitchen God's Wife were incredible. This novel was just strange all the way through and I kept reading hoping it would improve.....it didnt. Definitely not a keeper.
2,Nowhere Near Her Best Work,"Very disappointing book and a pity we had to wait so long for a new Amy Tan book and then get this!The tone of the book from beginning to end is just silly and trivializes what is an incredibly serious and horrific true story - that of the persecution of the Karen tribespeople in Burma by the Burmese military junta.Unlike her normal rhythmic writing, Tan wrote this book in a stilted, uncomfortable manner, and treated all the characters, Western and Karen alike, as simply idiots. But idiots who think they are correct about everything - which was annoying and sad. I also found the book difficult to cling onto often drifting off to read other books instead (I put it down any number of times with the hope that my interest would be peaked when I picked it back up - it wasn't!) and the story too weak to be memorable.Very little to like in this book but much to dislike. All in all, I can only say ""I finished it"", nothing much else is important."
1,Mediocre at best,"I picked up this book in an airport while waiting for a delayed flight because I enjoyed other Amy Tan books, but I was very disappointed with this one. Find another book if you're looking for a good story with engaging characters."
2,Disappointing,"I have always loved Amy Tan's writing. I have cried through many a story, or turned the last page of her books in absolute awe at how she brought the story together. Not this time! I thought there were too many characters for development, leaving them as caricatures. Half the time, I couldn't even keep them straight. The story was slooooow to develop. The deeper meaning, usually so strong in Tan's work, is practically absent here. This book felt longer than it was, and it took me nearly 2 weeks to slog through it.****WARNING...POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD******And when they returned to the U.S., what was the point of the groping scene between Esme and Rupert? I mean, really."
3,Disappointing,"I have enjoyed Amy Tan in the past. This work was very disappointing,it began well and was intriguing. I found it difficult to follow all the characters and at the end the story became trite.Bibi saved the book - and the introduction of how Tan discovered her topic was better than the book."
2,Disapointing after 2 years,"Shouldn't things last longer? How long have we been making telephones? I was happy with my my Motorolla phone for the first year. I didn't use it a lot (my cell phone is my primary number) though used the Motorolla for local calls and to screen calls from mortgage broakers, etc. After about a year, the keypad started going out (intermittently), it's gotten so bad that I can no longer use it to dial out. Just recently, there is an aweful static in the handset- it's junk now. If Motorolla can make a tiny cell phone that stands up to daily wear and tear you'd think making a big, clunky, old-tech, landline cordless would be no problem and it would last..."
1,AVOID,"I gave this phone a 5 star rating after I first got it. 2 months later, it went hay-wire. It was almost like it was possessed, then died. This phone didn't last long enough to remove the plastic screen guards. Now, I give this phone 1 star, but even that's too high. That's dissapointing being a Motorola. I like their products. TRUST THESE REVIEWS THAT HAVE TIME UNDER THEIR BELT. They're nice & sweet out of the box, but after that, it's all downhill baby....."
3,dissappointed,"Was disappointed in the content of the book, and did not delve into the band other than that which everyone already knows. Very little interviews with band members. Save your money!"
3,not the correct title!,"The above album, listed here as The Best Of... is actually The Punk Singles Collection. There is a Best Of (besides No Government), but it is on Dojo records, and is not listed anywhere on Amazon. I found out because I bought the above album, thinking it was The Best Of..."
1,unsatisfied,"i was very unsatisfied with this order.an item was shipped very fast, but the wrong item was delivered.i was told it was a computer glitch, then the correct item was no longer available. Shipping charges were refunded, but i was still disappointed that i did not get my original order."
5,Very interesting story line not unlike Downten Abbey,Interesting story line about the characters who live upstairs in the grand house and the characters who live downstairs andservice the gentry upstairs. Enjoyable all the way.
5,What a Series,"This is a great series and it is totally addictive. Can't wait for Season 3 to ship. Love , love, love it!"
1,WORTHLESS MUSICAL DRIVEL,"I RARELY TAKE A RECORD OFF BEFORE I HAVE HEARD IT IN ITS ENTIRETY, BUT I MUST SAY I WAS TOTALLY TURNED OFF BY TAN DUN'S PRETENTIOUS, UNMELODIC SCORE AS WELL AS BY THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE LIBRETTO. THIS COMPOSER SHOULD STICK TO MOVIE MUSIC, FOR WHICH HE IS SO MUCH BETTER SUITED. THE ONE OPERA? IN MY COLLECTION I AM SURE NEVER TO PLAY AGAIN!"
2,Wings Wipes,"Did not open package, yet, but do not feel this is a good product.The lid does not close very well. The container and openings are much larger than they need to be. Which I expect will affect the freshness/moistness of the product.For this reason, do not rate it a good value for the money."
4,"good, but not as good as 'Lost in the Stars'","This might be a five star disc except that the producer, Hal Willner, had already created Lost in the Stars, with some of the same people (Lou Reed, Charlie Haden). This follow-up is a little less adventurous, and the choices are more obvious. Basically, this is a soundtrack from a film project, and camera presence was a factor in choosing singers. Elvis Costello is remarkable on the song 'Lost in the Stars' and the gospel arrangement of 'Oh, Heavenly Salvation' also stands out. Lou Reed does the same song that he did on the earlier disc ('September Song') but this second take on it isn't as moving.Go ahead and buy this if you can't get the other one, but this is the second choice."
5,AWESOME,"Love it. A masterpiece. Love the Autolawks. Love the 4 point clip. Good blade. Prefer fixed blades, which it is with Autolawks. Easy one hand operation and very tough. Highly recommend. Can't go wrong with a CRKT Carson design."
5,buy this knife!!!,knife is larger than most folders and opens fast. comes with an extra clip. clip can can be fastened in 4 different positions depending on your preference. great tactical/ everyday knife for the money. highly recommended.
3,Cross,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
1,Software was returned,The software description was not explicit as to which MAC platform it would work on. My Power PC MAC will not run the software so it was returned to Amazon.
5,I love my Mortimer!,"I got this doll when I was about 8 (early 80's) at my Grandmother's house. My sister got WC Fields and my brother got Charlie McCarthy. I picked out Mortimer myself. I've had him now these many many years and he is still great. Unfortunately the string broke in the 90's (about 10 years after I had him) and so cannot use him as a ventriloquist doll anymore, but boy did we have fun with our dolls! I think he's unique looking and even liked him when I was a kid (obviously since I picked him). But he kind of freaks other people out, especially young kids (like the clown in Poltergeist). My daughter likes him though, go figure. I wish I could fix the string. It might not be a professional doll, but it was a great toy for us as kids and kept us entertained for hours!"
3,4 gb better sound,"Not quite sure why creative doesn't just save some time and say the 4 gig sounds better than the 8 gig. Different codec or something. I've owned recording studios etc etc and listen to mp3's through a set of Sony mdr-v900's as they don't require alot of power to drive. Source is 192 kbs downloads from Yahoo music to go (which you can no longer get. Have to go with 160 kbs as best pay as you go). I'm suprisingly satisfied with the sound, having been spoiled for years with high end equipment. Unforunately I can hear he difference. But unless you're listening to a high end speaker system, ie b&w 801's w dual bryston 600w per speaker etc etc, 192 kbs seems to work.But hey, the 8 gig ain't near the 4 gig and I just wish they'd let me know to save me some time. My two cents worth -"
2,"Cute, but problematic","I bought the V Plus last month, but had to return it to Amazon. I had the problem that seems to be common in several other reviews on CNET. The software kept freezing in the middle of playback, and I could not do anything - restart song, go back, even turn the player off - without resetting, which requires a pin or paper clip. Happened several times in the first week. My files were never deleted, but it was a pain. I was sad, but could not justify keeping it - I don't plan to carry a safety pin in my pocket when hiking.It is too bad, there was a lot to like about the player - the small size was great, sound was pretty good with EQ adjustment and menus were easy to navigate. I did not have much problem downloading files, and the bookmarking feature would have been nice to use since I listen to a lot of audiobooks (although I found bookmarking was not as easy to do as I thought anyway).Sorry, Creative. Hope the software/hardware issues will be improved in the next generation."
3,Sun Protection,"As a 16 year old young German serving in the French Foreign Legion, I was stationed in Morocco guarding French interests. Morocco has a very strong sun and it can be deadly. Nights are very cold as well. The Sun Protection Face Hood helps against a strong Moroccan sun, as soldiers of the French Foreign Legion are not allowed to wear local wear against the sun. Army issued Balaclava Desert Face Masks were not available due to the need in the Gulf War."
1,Awful,"This sounded like it might be funny and perhaps the premise is, but the execution of this premise is done so poorly it is remarkable. The acting is worse than your typical amateurs! Do not buy this film!"
1,Pahleeeeeze!!!,This was so bad! This is lower than low budget. If you just get off on watching IR than fine get it but seriously... it's bad!
2,And I thought I was the only one...,"...who finished this book thinking that Korda was a pompus twit with more money than good manners. His condesending observations of his neighbors left me irritated time and time again, as well as the name dropping and implied superiority of himself vs. the ""lowly"" country folk.If you discounted the snide comments, the first part of the book was pretty interesting. However, the last 4 chapters became rambling and could have been condensed into one chapter.It was great reading the reviews from the Hewitts on this forum. It made me remember that there are ALWAYS two sides to every story, and that Mr. Korda took some literary license in his book."
2,The barest glimpse of John Williams,"John Williams is one of the world's best guitarists, but you'd never know it by listening to this album. He basically plucks out the melody. I think I hear more complex playing in the background, but if that's what it is, it's mixed so as to be barely audible. On the other hand, it's very nice background music. I hope brisk sales support Williams' more serious efforts."
3,Trying to do too much,"I am sure you have read other reviewers synopsis, I won't do that. I love the idea of zombies and zombie stories. I have read a few and I am always disappointed when the author tries too hard to make the zombie transformation understandable and easily explained. A need to explain the zombie or in this case Xombie makes reading this book longer and takes the tension out of it and I never got the AHA moment the author was going after. Greatshell was very capable in keeping the reader engaged by holding on to vital information and letting us in very slowly on the secret. However, when the secret is revealed it is so contrived and convoluted that I started to lose interest. I finished the book because I was so far into it but I was disappointed in the end. Mr. Greatshell is there or hope or isn't there?"
2,DUPED!!!!!!!!!,"this book caught my eye by its title. i was like, cool, another zombie book thinking it would be like dawn of the dead or end of the world. you know, the typical zombie book. But it is soooo much more complicated than that! I had to read many pages over again so that i can understand the book myself. The beginning was great, but the middle with the submarine and what was waiting for them at their distination was soooo extremely slow that i stopped reading for a few days.It was a good, different idea for a book but needed not to be so long and complicated which made it a drag--in my opinion."
1,Out of my time,"The future, 1987 to be exact, is a time of electric cars (loaded with the latest quadraphonic sound systems), legalized marijuana (cigarettes have been outlawed), synthetic foods, legal narcotics (that are totally harmless with no side affects or after affects which the young and old enjoy), floating robots with artificial intelligence and time travel. And when you go to bed at night and it's too hot, just turn on the good old window unit. Unfortunately, to program a computer you need the latest ""Punch Cards"" and twist the right knob (oh, don't forget to change out the reel of tape). I always get a real chuckle when SF writers assume that current day technology will still be the same in the future.About the book: I found the story uninteresting. The characters irritating and forgettable. I suppose if I read it in 1972 when it came out, I would have been excited and amazed and this review would be unjustified. Oh well."
5,A Wonderful Time Travel Story - one of the best,Well Madeline Baker does it again. A Whisper in the Wind is a story to ponder about over and over again. All the characters in this novel were colorful and interesting to read about. At times you felt the joy and pain the Native Americans have endured in their lifetime. A wonderful read. I couldn't put the book down.
5,Christina:Saigon's Heart,"I felt this book to be from the heart of the author. He surely must have known his subject well, and in a very personal way.His grasp of the history of the period is interwoven with feeling for his subject. I believe that he must have known the woman in the story.He probably has his own reasons for placing it under the fiction label.It is a story that must be told many times."
3,OK - not great,"I thought the quality on my phone was just fine, but the battery didn't last (replaced it in < 1 yr and now, 6 mos. later, the 2nd one is going) and the 2nd handset keep losing contact with the base. IN addition, the base is not what I consider wallmountable...since it juts off the wall a good 8-10 inches (and gets whacked by everyone that walks by). I would have expected more from motorola.REgarding some other reviews, clearly people did not read their manual s or play with their phone, so I feel a need to clear a few things up:1. phone not ringing on cordless hand set OR phone ringing too loudly on handset---> you can adjust each handset to high, medium, low, off, or a different ring. Each handset adjusts separately (my bedroom is on low, my family room is on high).2. No volume control for earpiece --> There is an up/down controller on the side of the headset that allows for earpiece volume control."
1,Worst phone ever,This is absolutely the worst phone we've ever owned. The sound quality is terrible and the battery loses it's charge in just a few hours. Do not buy this phone. We're now looking for new phones to replace these.
4,A nightmare filled with visual treats,"One of the strangest films I've seen in a long while and I've seen many ! The sequence of life in the bathtub is remarkable and the visuals overall are superb. Not for everyone but for people like me who like their films strange and sometimes horrific, This one rocks !"
3,(3.5 stars),"A nice bit of the electric blues, from Buddy Guy, with a lot of organ and piano mixed in. But it's the truly wailing guitar numbers that really shine (""Had a Bad Night""). And the southern feeling ""Are You Lonely Baby"" also plays as an album highlight, as does a playfully funky cover of ""I Just Want to Make Love to You."" The slow blues grind of ""Did Somebody Make a Fool Out of You"" really changes the mood of the album, to a more somber, reflective atmosphere, with some timely acoustic guitar magic, before the album returns to its starting point in the upbeat, organ tinged ""When the Time Is Right.""A very enjoyable electric blues album."
3,Motorola MA551 cordless phone is...ok,"I like the look of this phone and particularly because it has a mute button to keep interruptions to my caller at minimal.The two negatives are this, (1) When I have the phone next to my ear and my face, I have hung up on callers by mistake because of the flat keypad which makes the ""Talk"" button vulnerable to hanging up if I make a sudden movement.(2)As the lighted number pad goes off (about 20-30 secs. after beginning a call), the phone makes a noticeable ""bad circuity"" noise.When I hear this I feel suspicious that the phone might burn out sooner than it's worth.I still like the phone but I have 2 mos. to return it.And I still may for the reasons mentioned.The Uniden 2.4 wasn't available at that time. James"
1,Don't waste your time!,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. It claims to be a 5.8 GHz but I can't move as far from the base as I can with my 2.4 GHz cordless phone. In addition, it has the habit of cutting off in the middle of calls!! Can't rely on it."
1,Un Fiasco!!!,"...Yo lamento mucho escribir este reporte para un teléfono de marca TAN PRESTIGIOSA, pero la verdad este producto no me funcionó para nada bien. La recepción es terrible, a una corta distancia de la base y 2-3 muros de por medio y olvídese de utilizar el teléfono pues la recepción es nula!. Puede ser que éste teléfono específico tuviese algún defecto, pero lamentablemente en Amazon me informaron que no tenían existencias en stock para reemplazarlo, así que mi única opción fue devolverlo y casi de inmediato Amazon me reitegró mi dinero. ¿Que pasó Motorola?, pilas ahí !!!"
2,MADE IN CHINA: Look elsewhere.,The highest volume setting is barely audible.The options are limited.More profit for an American company at the expense of Americans.
4,Not her best work,"If you're a hard-core Neko Case fan like I am, you need to buy this CD. There's some precious new material here that's really quite good: ""Train from Kansas City"", ""Rated X"", and a really nice performance of the traditional ""Wayfaring Stranger"". The old chestnut ""Favorite"" also makes it's debut on a ""major"" label CD (if Anti is a major label). It had been previously available only on Canadian Amp, sold only at Neko's shows.On the other hand, if you're looking to buy your first Neko Case CD, buy ""Blacklisted"" instead. I'd rate it as one of my top five ""Desert Island"" CD's. The live performance of ""Blacklisted"" is probably the most powerful track on ""Tigers""."
5,Ok Book,THis is an ok book to just show family members when you try to tell them you have fibromyalgia. It is a simple book that they can read to understand. Otherwise there are better books out there.
1,Disappointed,"I understand this is a publication ""for dummies"", meaning it's for people who do not know much about the subject. Even so, I was appalled by the fact that this book contains so little, while its author claims to explain so much. The kind of advice I found in the book is really just what a person with no knowledge on the subject but with good sense could tell me. I went to the sections that interested me most and could not find anything of interest there. The questions I had were unanswered. One example: I wanted to know about foods that can trigger fibromyalgia, and what the book says is that coffee and chocolate may be bad for you (no wonder, once coffee and chocolate are considered bad for almost all conditions), and that there are foods that can trigger fibromyalgia (but what foods? THAT was the information I wanted!) It may be a good book if you have never heard of fibromyalgia before. But I'm sure you can get more information on the internet."
5,Great Television,As usual the Brits have a winner with this show. It was great to get the series. I love the extra commentary and the storyline is remarkable. I have watched these shows over and over. I ordered Series 5 months before it came out. You will enjoy this collection.
5,Fabulous!,"I started watching Doc Martin several months ago on PBS and was enchanted from the first five minutes. Unfortunately, PBS programs the show in between their fund raising, so there might be three weeks before the next show comes on. I've decided to spend the $74.00 to watch all of the seasons without interruption. Well worth the money for this incredible, well thought out and fabulous acting show."
3,Doc Martin Series Marred by Darkness,"The Doc Martin: Collection - Series 1 -4 was ordered on Dec. 12 and arrived at my sister's home in California in very good time. That is a big plus. However, she reports to me that the DVDs are very dark in colour. I have seen the series on PBS and there was no darkness of colour, so this is very disappointing in the reproduction of the series. I am curious to know if the series was reproduced by various companies or did they come from just one source."
5,Great British comedy!,WE were thrilled to get all four series in one set. Now we don't have to wait or search for the newest show on tv. Worth the price!
1,Mini is right!,"This thing is tiny! if you are storing rations for a stranded mouse or tufts of lint it'll work, otherwise skip it."
4,cute AND tiny!,"It's sorta small, I expected the tin tote to be a little bigger than this.... it's about the size of a WALLET and is 1 and 1/2 inches thick, but it was delivered exactly on the delivery date and early in the morning too. I now store erasers in it and keep it in my school backpack. I like it, and the graphics on it are VERY VERY clear.... though, there is no latch on it. 4 stars (:"
5,"Vandor Mini Tote, The Beatles","I bought this for my 26 year old son's birthday because he likes the Beatles. I filled this with Beatles pins that I also bought on Amazon. He was very pleased with it, and my daughter's boyfriend said that he would like me to adopt him if I give presents that that. So it was a very successful gift choice."
3,What a business,"A quick, entertaining memoir of Jimmy Wagner's short and adreneline soaked career as a New York PI. Famous people, good and bad, populate this fast paced tale."
5,A great Book,This book is a great book. It hits so close to home considering things going on nowadays but it his hard to believe that some of these stories are real. You will NOT beleive the story about the lady and the dog.BUY IT!!!
4,A very entertaining book.,"This book was an entertaining piece collection of stories. Although a few of the stories seemed too unrealistic to have actually happened, it was a fun book to read. Jimmy gave an insight to the world of private investigation for the purpose of entertaining the audiences and he succeeded in doing that."
5,Bookchin Debunked,"Bob Black thoroughly debunks Murray Bookchin's ""Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm"" while meticulously exposing the inconsistencies in Bookchin's Social Ecology. Black has the gift of being able to get complex ideas across in a humorous and easy to read style. Anarchy After Leftism is a great introduction to Post Left Anarchist thought. Anyone seriously interested in understanding modern day Anarchism would do well to read this book. People who want to play Anarchist in a Leftist counterculture would be better off sticking to Chumbawambafied pseudo-Anarchist authors like Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky."
1,"ad hominem's are nice, but a real book is better","This book is the essential reading for those who desire to leave ""Leftism"" behind and make the most fatal mistake that would leave Guy Debord shaking his head at Black, who apparently has transcended all historical context to form a new vision for anarchism leaving behind hundreds of years of revolution, rebellion, abolition, and insurrection behind. Fool Bob Black is a fool"
3,ok,Just seems ok. Not too much to go crazy about. If l was going to buy a similar product again l'd probably buy them individualy.
2,POOR QUALITY!,"looks good in the pic but the actual product is roughly made, and the package has holes on it, as if it's a product some other customer returned >:/"
5,Very quick delivery and good size,Ordered the blow dryer because it was the cheapest and would have to say it is a good blow dryer for the price and it came 5 days after I ordered it.
3,Not good,heavy plastic smell. Sometimes doesn't work well.Good thing is that one can choose between different speed and temperature of the flow.
2,Jenn,"I returned this item....it was too large and heavy to use with one hand, especially when the defuser was attached.recommend"
4,Turbo Dryer,the dryer works good. well balanced and controls are easy to adjust. I was expecting the high fan speed to put out more volume of air.(turbo)
4,"Great book, first person from the building of the River Kuai Bridge","A gripping story that is all the better because it is true. It covers the fall of Singapore, the building of the Burma Railroad and being a POW in a Japanese WWII camp. But it's more than that, it's a life story of a man who comes to grips with his torture and finally his torturer. It's a moving story and you won't be able to put it down.I also readShip of Ghosts: The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of her Survivorswhich focuses more on the guys who laid the rails. Eric being an officer and skilled labor was spared that task, but it also was his downfall as a POW.The thing that struck me was that his take was that for every meter of track someone died. Either conscripted native labor or a POW. And that now that track is only 60 miles long and deadends with minimal usage. What a waste.Oh, and waterboarding, it's not just for the prisoners in Gitmo, Eric got the full treatment."
4,"""Waterboarding"" in WWII","When I read this book 10 years ago, I couldn't understand what Lomax was talking about when he described how he was held down by Japanese soldiers, a cloth placed over his face, and water poured over him.It's now very topical.It's a very honest and informative personal story, as well"
4,Awakening,"Brings back to reality, the struggles that our POW's, any POW's went thru during the War. Jamanese were ruthless, and its hard for any veteran to forget"
4,Not what I expected,"I guess I didn't realize how much the ""railroad"" would come into play for such a long time at the start of the book. Took me FOREVER to get thru it and I almost gave up reading the remainder. However , now that I'm at the part of his life as a POW, it's more interesting. I actually had purchased the book for my elderly father (79) but realize now that it's not something he would have the patience to read. Kinda disappointing."
4,It could have been better,"This selection of Charles contains at least two masterpieces, Singer's 'Gimpel the Fool' and Babel's 'First Love'. It also contains two wonderful surprises, Yehuda Yaari's modern version of the Solomonic story of two mothers contending for the same child, and the Alexander Baron story of his two grandmothers, one living in a house of light and joy, and the other in the house of darkness. Baron's changed perspective of this in adulthood makes for a moving and perceptive work. Other stories are by Irwin Shaw, Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Brian Glanville,Isaac Rosenfeld, Dan Jacobson,S. Yizhar, Arnold Wesker, Greda Charles.My sense is that given the riches available the collection could have been a much better one.."
5,Bought two they're so good!!,This roller was used for making cookies for the holidays. They were a gift for the baker making the cookies to replace the 38 year old double pastry roller she had that snapped and broke. I bought two of these magnificent pastry rollers and they worked out perfectly. A great bargin since they go for $35 in a bake shop. Highly recommended!!
3,basic roller...,"I purchased the roller as a gift...bought one for myself as well..The wood, is basic maple, it seems. One of the units had a chip in the wood and the end brackets on the larger roller seem bent out of shape..I would recommend seeing on in a store before you buy...This may be true for all wooden kitchen utensils, I'm not sure.Regards,NetmechDB"
3,it was ok,"Love Letters is the story of Derrick and Candace, a young couple who's trying to find love. The two start dating, but they never seem to get anywhere, they are always thinking things like what the other is thinking,but they never say what's on their mind. I wanted the book to last longer with them knowing they were in love instead of always wondering."
1,I think this is a foolish attach on the Islamic religion,"I find books like this offensive and not researched. If the author did any research in the Islamic scriptures, both the Quran and Hadith, he would have writen about the high status women hold in Islam . He obviously does not know much about the religion to air such ludicrous statements let alone publish a book."
5,Helpful to fight sexism,I totally agree with the author. I could have done writting the similar book to expose the injustice done in the name islam. Many thanks for the courage to write out despite fatwas from religious bigots. I now dare declare that I have abandon Islam for secular humanism.
5,A great Ars Magica adventure,"I ran chapter 1 about 6 months ago. It was subtly challenging. Last week I ran chapter 2, and the birds lets loose 6 months ago really came home to roost.I literally had the players screaming at me!A great Ars Magica adventure so far."
5,90's society for sure. Fast hip front page big city thiller,"Once you start you can't stop. Levin is in touch with todays breed of criminal. This book is provocative,hip,sick,and the kind of story we could all picture captivating our own city and shaking once again our concept of ""your safe in your own home"" A must read forsure"
1,Wait for the Warner Brothers DVD restortation in 2007!,"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs. You usually get rare obscure cartoons in presentable, if not good, condition for generally a dollar.But when it comes to Popeye, I must tell everyone that Warner Brothers is gotten the rights to restore the classic B&W; and Color theatrical Popeyes from 35mm master negatives for a 2007 release. So wait for that release."
1,Did not get the order,"I am writing to notify that this item was charged on my credit card but was never delivered to my Kindle. I had to call the cc to have the charges removed, I was not able to fix the problem through your system, other than calling my cc company."
1,Content-of the book-writers style & publishers choices,"Dealing with Amazon is GREAT! The BOOK in and of itself is horrible! The author speaks in circles and jumps topics.To give you an idea of how unorganized he is... Chapter 9 will tell you to go back to chapter 3 to review a graph for the topic in 9. Why the publisher could not just take the 2 inches of space and drop the graph into 9 is beyond me. If you have a choice to choose a book for Micro Economics for your MBA. VOTE AGAINST THIS ONE! IT IS THE MOST DRY AND ANNOYING BOOK I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF "" HAVING "" TO READ! I think I might burn it when the class is over!"
5,A comprehensive survey suitable for a college course,"Dennis Silage's DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS USING SYSTEMVUE would be a fine college text with its comprehensive survey of the Agilent SystemVue simulation environment. Advanced users of the communications simulator will find here plenty of analysis and insights on DSP processors and applications, offering pros and advanced digital communications users an introduction to the SystemVue environment using plenty of examples and results."
5,Heather is GREAT! BUY THIS CD!,"When I bought siren i didnt know anything about heather... but now im glad i bought it!!! Paper Cup, reminds me of Pacey and Andie from Dawsons Creek... It was so sad when they said goodbye... :( Also give Widescreen, Avalanche, and Heart and Shoulder a listen... JUST SKIP TRACK 6, Im the girl is the worst song ive ever heard, but when i listen to the whole cd, with the exception of track 6, its a great CD... and definitley worth a look."
3,Brighter but not amazing,"This bulbs are brighter than the original in my Volvo S80, but not as brighter as I expected."
2,Not very silver,"I have these in two different cars, both Volvos. They are a very small step up from stock. The pattern is all over the place, and the color is cool YELLOW. Not SILVER, they are way overpriced for what they deliver. There must be a better alternative!"
3,Short lived brightness,"These bulbs do provide a better view of what's coming in the dark. I have been using these replacement bulbs as a means to improve my night vision. They WORK! However, they do not last as long as the standard OEM bulbs. Once you invest in these bulbs, it is hard to return to the standards, so be prepared to pay@"
1,One star is too many.,"I cannot recall another product that so consistently lowers my expectations. I have been through 6 of these bulbs in a Mazda5 in less than 2 years with fairly limited night driving. They were installed correctly, were not exposed to water, and failed on both sides. I took to carrying a spare in the glove box in case I got stopped by the police who noted the burnt bulb before I did. I have seen nothing but similar complaints at other consumer sites.I have replaced these with a Phillips model that seems more durable thus far.Stay away."
1,Missing scenes - find a better DVD,"This DVD is really low quality. The sound is very low, and the movie is even missing scenes... what the heck?I'm not expecting Criterion treatment here, but skip this version in particular. The movie is worth a few bucks for the five or six truly funny scenes."
1,Useless Web Related Book,"Note the subtitle: award winning web site DESIGNERS, not designs. This is a compilation of graphics from a short list of web site design firms. No actual web site is presented in its entirety. The fact that these graphics originate from web pages is irrelevant in this book. The book strives to be artsy in itself, splattering a hodge-podge of non-sequitor images across each section prefaced by meaningless musings from a web designer. Even worse, many of the graphics are distorted and difficult to view. This is not a good source of web graphic ideas. Better ideas are available on the Internet for free."
2,book was in ver poor condition with ripped pages and stains,Well it was ripped on some of the pages one was even ripped out but the page was in there and a lot of stains
3,this printing had the wrong color plates,"Unfortunately, the book I received had color plates for the NE U.S.--flowers from Massachusetts, etc. A nice error by the publisher. The text was as expected based on a version of this book I had seen. I guess I can always tear the plates out. Let the buyer beware."
3,Mediochre Performance,"A mediochre performance. Entertaining, but not very exciting to watch. Perhaps that is because it is not performed in front of a live audience. The concert hall is empty. The sound and picture quality are quite good. The conductor is a bit wierd. Check it out on YouTube."
4,Getting a conversation going between teens and adults,"Conversations On the Go is a book of questions which are geared towards helping teens and adults engage in meaningful conversations. Sometimes as a teenager it's not so easy to find a common ground with an adult or vice versa. With topics such as, ""In what way do you wish you had more freedom?"" and ""What is the silliest thing you've ever done in public"" the ice could be easily broken and conversations could flow freely between people of different ages."
4,Very good comng-of-age movie,"This movie was very good, but a little hard to follow at times. Still, it was interesting to watch and follow the escapades of the kids as they tried to manage on their own."
1,sharp hdtv- stay away from Tiger Direct!,"I had to return my tv- it was dead when it arrived. when i phoned sharp, they said it happens all the time with products from Tiger Direct-STAY AWAY from TIGER DIRECT was their advise and mine!"
2,Could've been worse,"You could tell this movie was from the 90's; a little gratuitous sexual innuendo that really detracted from the movie. Varney was good; I don't know if I was disappointed or not that he didn't do his bizarre Earnest-esque schtick (hey, I like juvenile humor!) Bader did a great Jethrine. Beyond that, the plot was very one-dimensional. They could have wrung alot more humor out of the characters and the situations. Compared to most modern movies, it was very nice; compared to the original series it was a disappointment."
1,never received it!!!,"I could not even rate this movie if i wanted to, because I have still not received it!!"
5,Video,Daughter loved the video. I am a fan of Amazon.com and love the fact that I can find what I need at one location....one stop shopping! It's the way to go.
1,Not the Beverly Hillbillies!,"Captures none of the folksy comedy of the original series instead relying on bathroom humor. Don't waste your money or time. Spend your money on the TV series instead. Only thing worth mentioning is Lily Tomlin as Jane Hathaway who almost captures to a T the characterization of the original Nancy Culp. Otherwise, this one's a turkey and Jed would be a-shootin it!"
3,"not bad, but could have been better","After reading the NY Times review I was excited to get my hands on this book. Unfortunately, the feeling I kept getting was someone that was writing for other writers and not a general audience. It would be hard not to fall into such a trap, I suppose. With all the raves from peers and others, the poor guy must have felt like the world was looking over his shoulder. (for a great example of how the short story writer can achieve writing for the masses without sacrificing art, look at 'Venus Drive' by Sam Lipsyte).The master of 20th century fiction, John Updike once said writers workshops worry him because it creates an insulated environment. I'm not saying Tester is not a real talent - clearly he is. I'm only suggesting he focus next time on substance over style. Not giving up on Tester, and I look forward to his future work."
3,Nothing special,"I am a bit disappointed in this book. It has some diagrams of horse anatomy and movement that are useful, but there's not much in it about painting. I was really hoping for more detail about color and the little things that make horses a challenge to draw and paint. This book would be most useful for the beginner artist, or an artist who isn't familiar with horses."
5,Really cool music,This is really neat music. I think that this is one of my new favorites. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do.
4,I Wish I Was A Ballerina,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loved this film. I think she learned a lot and watched it several times in a row! As a ballet teacher myself, I was impressed with the kids in this piece and yes, Wishing Well Willie was a bit much to stomach over and over, but she didn't seem to mind! Wishing they would've introduced tap, though...."
2,"I can't get over the feeling that this is, basically, B.S.","Like some of the other submitting bad reviews, I've admired Eno's work for 20+ years. This pushes ambient out beyond the limits into tedium. It seems to me that the best ambient music allows the listener the option of actively listening, or putting the music somewhere in the background of one's attention. This recording cannot be listened to actively. It can't be done. Futhermore, in the background, it is annoyance more than anything else. We're talking one synthesizer voice, and not a very interesting one, and a loop. Period. Unless you are a big Eno fan, in which case you've already bought it, don't."
2,Not a favorite,"haha, I loved the review byNick Jorgensen! This would have beena great piece had it been treated morelike Music for Airports and renderedfrom different perspectives - the unvaryingquality of this just begs for some change. It issimply too minimal for its own good, andtruely isn't any more ""interesting"" thandrying paint. Now, we all know the Masteris capable of better than this."
4,The most demanding of Eno's ambient CD's,"Numerous other reviewers have made the argument that this CD does not reward conscious listening and in fact demands an extremely low playback volume for maximum effectiveness. I think these reviewers are on the right track but do not follow the demands of this piece to their logical conclusion. The playback volume should be so low that no sound whatsoever may be heard from the speakers. In fact, the stereo shouldn't even be turned on when listening to this CD. You shouldn't even take it out of the jewel box. In fact, you shouldn't even think about this CD. There is no Neroli. Stop reading this review. A koan: if Neroli is playing in an empty forest, does it make a sound?"
4,Good album but not for my preference,"I expect to get Passionate instrumental music according the existed reviews about this album but not what I expect because I didn't listen to the samples. However, this music is for quiet music listeners who don't want too many aggressive musical instruments composition."
4,A treasure of a book,"Of all the Romance novels I've read, I like Time-Spun Treasure the best. The author skillfully induces the reader into suspending reality and accepting the possibility that people--and their possessions--can travel back through time. Along the way she employs clever devices such as 20th century colored contact lenses to confuse 18th century denizens. The story is a blend of science fiction, historical novel, and murder mystery...all deftly woven together in the context of a scorching love affair. The plot is a page-turner and the dénouement quite satisfying. I give it two thumbs up and four stars.SS in ValP"
2,The Big Orchestra Business,Cross-over entertainment for popular music lovers asking for the big orchestra sound. In the orchestra business Duke Ellington was more consistent and composed better music.
2,Disappointing album from a guy musician,"while i love Zakk Wylde and his musical integrity and passion, i've even grown to resent those that carry a chip on their shoulder because of things out of their control. there's no question of his talent as anyone knows, but this album isn't half as musical as Pride and Glory or Book of Shadows. P&G showed his amazing jamming aspect on top of good songs. But, BLS song structures are lacking---if not ""sonically""(no pun intended on Sonic Brew) Bored to Tears is a decent tune, but from there it's just pissy music. I believe his live shows suffered(why does he have another guitarist with him? ) not only from the negativity of the album and his character on stage, but the high volume caused it to be lacking musically all the more. I love Zakk Wylde, but i hope his next step actually spells ""MUSIC"" I want another P&G or something that suits Zakks strong points."
5,BEST WORK YET!,ONCE AGAIN ZAKK WYLDE HAS DONE THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSABLE AND HAS TURNED OUT BETTER WORK THEN THE PREVIOUS! AND THATS A HARD TASK TO DO. ZAKK'S SHAMELESS APPROACH TO SONG WRITING LENDS ITSELF TO THIS CD. A MUST HAVE!
3,lost potential,"What is it with historical romantic fiction these days? What is it with the stolen treasure/a heroine falsely accused of murder/a long-lost treasure map? What happened to good ol fashioned sexual tension coupled (pardon the pun) with some familial objections and secret rendevous? If I want suspense and a cliched gun-goes-off-oh-no-who-does-it-hit? scene I'll read some John Grisham. What a Woman Needs in her romantic fiction is basically Pride and Prejudice but with more sex.The author has all the makings of a Judith Ivory-esque book: good writing, two appealing romantic leads, a complication with the heroine's family, some hot bedroom action. She proceeds to muck it up with some convuluted story about a lost treasure which of course takes away from valuable snog time. If you like a predictable chase scene, this is the book for you.All I know is Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy never had to chase after mummies."
2,Just a Bunch of Charts...,"If you like colorful graphics and charts this book is for you. But it is not a good reference book. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK. I found ""cradle cap"" and there was a definition but nothing regarding the treatment of it. There is NO INDEX. The information is not really in sequence (e.g. by age of baby). There are grammatical errors in the book and a bank of advertisements in the back. It's pretty and I enjoy flipping through it, but as far as a parental reference book goes, an additional resource is absolutely required."
2,INTERESTING INFORMATION BUT EXTREMELY BRIEF,"There have been endless numbers of books written on childhood development to the point where some books contradict others. It is no wonder parents can become confused when it comes to sorting out what is good advice and what is not. This book does provide some very basic guidlines to follow when raising children, but the book truly does not give readers what the title implied, a thorough understanding of children. It is highly questionable if any book can do that, particularly one that is so brief with just over two hundred pages. The book was rather sketchy and lacked sufficient detail to be of tremendous benefit. On the positive side, what information the book did provide made for quick and interesting reading. As for understanding children, as both a parent and one who is a counsellor, I would have a difficult time recommending this book as an abundant source of worthwhile information."
4,Gossip Girl #1: review by Miranda,"This book was filled with drama and romance and all the things teen girls love to read about. I read it at age 14 and I liked it a lot. However, some things could be improved, and that is why I gave it 4 stars."
1,Gossip Girl is NOT so good,"Everyone raves about these books saying they get guilty pleasure from reading them and that they love the characters. Ok first of all, you shouldn't feel the least bit guilty about reading a book. Second, the characters in this books are trashy [...] who shouldn't be anyone's role models or even someone you admire. I've honestly given these books a chance, but it's just a bunch of crap. People should really find other stuff besides this series. Try the Mates, Dates and Truth or Dare series by Cathy Hopkins or My Cup Runneth Over by Cherry Whytock. Maine Squeeze by Catherine Clark is another good one. Trust me, there is so much more beyond Gossip Girl."
2,Gossip Girl,The book Gossip Girl by Cecily von Ziegesar isn't very entertaining. It has so many characters in the book but not much happens in all 200 pages. I was disappointed when I read the book because I expected a book that is close to reality with interesting characters and a good plot. Instead when I read the book it just seemed like someone was stalking a few people and saying untrue things about what they did.
1,Parents Beware!!!,"If you care about your kids, you will not let them read this shallow, superficial, morally bankrupt series. These books are void of anything edifying or appropriate not just for teenage girls, but for anyone period. Don't support this kind of worldly sludge that only serves to lower the standards of young people and compromises their opportunity for real happiness --- This envious escapism is HARMFUL!"
1,Not for me...,"I just didn't like this at all. I found the book basically boring and pointless. Blair is jealous of her long time friend, Selena, who has been away at boarding school. When Selena returns, Blair fuels the fire of the gossip circle to backstab her former best friend. Nobody in the book seemed very memorable or worth the time it took to read this book, more about a lot of over-privileged teens sampling all types of mischief... gossip, drugs, heavy and constant alcohol consumption, and worse."
1,a waste of both time and brain cells,"I could actually feel my IQ declining as I read this. I think I've recovered now, but I wanted to warn others, lest this become an epidemic! This book was beyond shallow -- it purports to criticize the upper crust of NY society, but instead it finds new and boring ways to glorify it. There are so many good books on the shelves right now -- do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
2,there are better books than this.,"Lots of girls at my school reads the gossip girl series.So, I decided to read the first book. Yet.. it was so menial compared to other books that I've read. I understand why it has other people my age who normally don't read for fun, reading it. That's a good thing. But it's like a tv show like the O.C. or something on paper. It has no lasting meaning behind it.The plot is basically :A bunch of rich people going to parties, being nasty to each, wearing expensive clothes and (what do you know..) gossiping.Mildly entertaining. But if I wanted that I could just as easily watch TV or see a movie, a bad movie.This is a good book for people who don't like to read as it isn't challenging in the least or if you just like this kind of story.But if you're looking for a book that you'll really enjoy and remember, this isn't it."
2,Not All That I Expected,"In this novel by Cecily von Ziegesar, her characters live in a world full of rich, shallow people. I didn't like the message that this book is sending out to teen readers. I think everyone should know that there is a lot more to teen life than parties, shopping, and impressing everyone with your wealth. None of these girls have real friends or relationships. All interactions are based on looks and not on personality. These people are not well-rounded and they have no goals in life. I thought the message this sent out to people is that when you look good, it doesn't matter wheather you're smart, kind, or have good character because people will like you no matter what. This is not true in the real world, and girls should not be misled by this. This book has no real plot, and therefore it seems to drone on page by page. I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen, but it never did."
4,Gossip Girl Can be GOOD!!,Gossip Girls Can be GOOD!Gossip Girl was a very interesting book! The plot made me not want to put the book down because I was always wonting to know what was happening next.Cecily von Ziegeasar introduces charters with gossip. Ziegeasar dose it in such away you want to find out more and more about the charters.You get hooked on the book. You know everybody likes the hear a little gossip once and a while. The gossip in this book was so engrossing.The gossip in this book is like real gossip. You feel like one of the charters in the book and you are one of there friendsVon Ziegeasar did a good job on drawing the reader into the story.Other books I have read about teenagers are usually sugar coated with things real teens don't do! This book talks about how things are really for teenagers.This book is to gossip as Nancy Drew is to mystery. So if you like gossip you will love this book and all its sequels!!!!!!
4,Quick and fun,"This is a quick and fun YA novel, the first in the series the hit TV show is based on. While it is interesting and entertaining to read, I find it hard to identify with these rich, privileged, city-dwelling party kids. I suppose it's a vicarious thrill, but I wonder how realistic it is. Maybe it isn't supposed to be realistic; it is fiction after all. I wonder what kind of message this is sending to the young readers and viewers, because I worry about things like that. However, that does not detract from how much (guilty) pleasure I took from reading it. If it sounds like this is a mixed review, it is. I haven't seen the show, but I'm interested enough after reading this to put it on my Netflix queue. Update to this review is forthcoming once I view it.Update: Finish the books before watching the show. The differing plot points tend to be confusing."
5,Too GOod to be True,"The Gossip Girl series is so addictive. You cant put this book down! I just love hearing about Blairs traumas, or Serenas new flavor of the week. I would reccomend this book to ANYONE and EVERYONE!"
5,"Juicy gossip never hurts, unless it's about you.","This book is what every teen girl needs, what girl isn't interested in some juicy gossip.This book is about a girl named Blair. On the outside she seems to have the perfect life. She has a cute boyfriend, she's rich, lives in a penthouse in Manhattan. That's just the outside.Really she's an emotional wreck. Two years ago her boyfriend slept with her former best friend, her parent's are divorced because her dad is gay. She has a bad habit of throwing up and her mom is dating a loser. It seems bad until her former best friend, Serena, comes back, tossing her already messed up life into a whirlwind.I definitely recommend this book if you like gossip. It's basically a soap opera in a book!"
1,Stereotypical and trashy,"If you're looking for any sort of intelligent or thought provoking, this is definately not the book for you. The girls were stereotypical teenagers... getting drunk, having sex, and ""suffering"" from bulimia. This book is not about real girls, but rather the teenagers that some adults tend to believe exist. There were so many times while reading that I had to stop just because I was so angry at the characters. It was not only poorly written, but it was offensively written.Definately NOT recommended!"
3,Sad content,"The content of this series saddened me tremendously. As I read I wondered what we were hoping to gain as readers and writers by consuming the sad, fictional portrayals of wealthy teenagers."
3,Can't use as Car Adapter for Garmin GPS,There is something about the USB connecter that makes the Garmin think it's connected to a computer and makes it go into sync mode... and therefor unusable as a car adapter. It does however allow my Garmin to sync quite easily to my computer ;->
2,"Wonderful performances, awful sound","Can I give this two and a half stars? That'll be five for the performances and zero for the sound, then.Seriously, the performances are everything you might expect- energetic, exciting and wholly idiomatic. Lenny and the NY Phil are just in their element.But the sound... now, CBS were never noted for their sonics, and this compilation - even with presumably sympathetic remastering - shows why.On a half decent system, let alone high-end, this sound doesn't seem to have emanated from anything remotely resembling an orchestra- spot miked, giant instruments leap and screech around, no stage, depth, warmth, ambience or hall sound. Violins sound more like giant kazoos. Ouch. Not a good advert for analog, this sounds more like generation zero digital on a bad day.I wish I could say more nice things, but this sounds just nasty. Even with these performances, I just find it difficult to listen through to the music."
1,mp3 cuts off ends of pieces!,"I just purchased this in mp3 format and started listening on the Amazon Cloud Player - the very first piece is cut off before the sound trails off and it jumps to the next piece! This is very disappointing and a horrible thing to do to such a beautiful piece of music. I don't know if this is only an issue with the mp3 version or not, but I suspect it is since no other reviewers that I've read so far have mentioned it. Cutting off the end really wrecked the mood for me. Very annoying. :(The one star is solely because that faulty editing on the MP3 version pretty much ruins a great piece of music."
5,Great documentary!,"This is a really great documentary. It does not really go in to a great deal of political detail. Instead it focuses on the thoughts, feelings and suffering of the victims. It also tries to get an idea of the feelings of those who dropped the bomb. It is sad and atmoshperic and left me very moved. The original music is superb and adds to the melancholy air. The film introduces several victims from both Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their stories are breathtaking, but told without malice or anger, just a profound sadness. There is one victim from Nagasaki who describes his horrific burns as being so agonising that he simply wanted to die (many others begged to be killed also). He was a small boy when he suffered those terrible burns and he describes how the love of his mother gave him the courage to go on despite his physical disfigurement.A very sad film, but one that should be watched."
4,This book is a welcomed and long overdue publication!!,"MUSICHOUND FOLK: THE ESSENTIAL ALBUM GUIDE is one of the best and most complete compilations of reviews and descriptions of folk artists' works that I have yet seen. Bravo for an excellent start!!However, I would like to recommend that the inclusion of the following artists would improve the coverage and render the book even more comprehensive!!1. Tom Rapp (Pearls Before Swine) 2. Bob Carpenter ( Canadian songwriter) 3. Lee Clayton (Folk/Country artist) 4. John Martyn (British Folk/Rock artist) 5. Willie P. Bennett (Canadian songwriter) 6. Murray McLauchlan (Canadian songwriter) 7. Decameron (British Folk/Rock band) 8. Lindisfarne (British Folk/Rock band) 9. Michael Chapman (British folk/Rocker) 10. Terry and Gay Woods (Terry was in the Pogues and both were in Steeleye Span) This is a short list but it is evident that more research into British and Canadian folk music would improve this book. Nevertheless, I applaud this great begining!!"
4,Not what I expected but good.,"This was not at all what I expected. I got the impression that it was a story book about the body with an added CD. What it actually is, is a CD with an attached lyric book (a few illustrations here and there). The CD is fun. The lyrics are charming and chalk full of information. The musical arrangements are actually pretty good - certainly a lot better than much of the ""children's music"" I've heard. Think School House Rocks."
4,"200 Super Fun, super fast math story problems","A math problem for practically every day of the year. Funny short stories - logic, fractions and everything in between."
5,from Rachel,"I ordered two books, PEOPLE OF THE COVENANT, and both ccame in record time and were in excellent condition. I plan to order more of the same title and hope they will be available for a class beginning in October. Thanks so much!"
5,The challenge and richness of embracing what is.,"Awake in the Heartland zeros in on the apparent obstacles to being deeply present and awake to what is. Through her own life experiences, which include seeking out and being near many non dual teachers, the beauty and challenges in her day to day encounters with others, but mainly herself, addictions she has silenced and one that continues, Joan writes with a disarming honesty and presence which reminds me again and again of the wisdom of embracing this moment."
2,Bait and Switch,"I have been using a Mr. Clean sheepskin wheel care brush for several years until it finally wore out. I searched online for a replacement, and the only place I ""found"" one was through Amazon.com from a vendor called AUTOGEEK.NET I ordered two, since I liked using the original product so much. What I received were two substitute brushes with a brand name of ""CARRAND"", which, in my opinion, are not of the same design or quality of the original Mr.Clean brand. These substitute brushes are fatter and shorter than the original, and thus more difficult to use in tight spaces within the wheels.Am I happy? No. Do I recommend the MrClean brush? Yes, if you can find one. Do I recommend CARGEEK? No. I feel that a company should at least give a customer the courtesy of a phone call if they intend to take your money and substitute for a product which they can't provide."
5,Awesome!,"Oops I forgot to leave a product review when I purchased this almost 3 years ago! Excellent service, received merchandise in 4 days instead of the estimated time of 3 weeks! Product is exactly what it testifies to. Excellent product highly recommend to all, this is the one and only true sauna suit it's high quality, stylish, and produces results!"
3,Uncomfortable!,"We bought the entire Falkner Dining collection based on the good reviews. I will say that they are good looking on our patio, very durable, but, unfortunately, the chairs are very, very uncomfortable. The open back is the problem, if there were cushions for the backs, they would help. I actually bought some pillows for the backs, which are more comfortable to sit against, but bulky. Also, many forks, knives etc. fall through the open slats in the table. I don't think I would have bought this set if I knew the chair backs would be so uncomfortable."
3,a wondefully funny regency romance,"This is the first book I've read by this author and it won't be the last. I found this book to be filled with wonderful humor and wit. I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters, Simon and Calli. The secondary characters of Simon's mother, Simon's two best friends, Bones and Armand were all wonderful. I hope to see a book about Armand soon. I loved Lester and Simon's servants. They whole cast made this a very enjoyable book. So much so that I read it all in one sitting until 2:30 in the morning! The plot is zany but well thought out although I would have liked the to see the villian come to a more fitting end. I will read this book again and plan on getting more of Kasey Michael's books."
2,Info withheld by manuf.,"The Bionaire Model BH3950 Space Heater did not disclose two things, first: How quickly it takes at full temperature setting to warm a 10' x 10' area; second: how much energy it consumes. Having known these facts would have made it easy to decide. I might have had to send more money for my needs. All in all, what the manufacture disclosed was true. (New!)"
2,Had to return it,Horrible smell even 2nd day. Does not heat well at all. My tiny $16 heater does better. Defective? I don't know but sure doesn't put out heat.The packing box was damaged almost ripped open.I will say it was very easy to assemble and is extremely lightweight with wheels. I am disappointed that so little heat came from it.
2,Not hot enough,"It just doesn't get hot enough. It seems to give off an ok amount of heat from the top but not enough from the sides. Unless I'm propping my ankles on top of the heater, it doesn't keep me warm."
2,Great - For About 2 Months,"I purchased one of these and absolutely loved it. It heated very well without any fan noise.However, after about 2 months I noticed it stopped heating effectively so I took a closer look. It seems that 2 of the 3 vertical heat elements have stopped working, reducing its ability to heat my room.I called their customer support and based on my serial number they agreed to replace it. However they said they were out stock and to call back in about a week. So I waited two weeks to call back only to find out they will be out of stock until fall, and that I need to call back in the fall in order to get a replacement.It seems they have had a high failure rate with this model and have been unable to keep up with demand for replacements.I will call again in the fall. We'll see if they still honor the warranty as promised."
3,Alzheimers - The health food approach,"For:This book examines the dietary problems that cause alzheimers, and some other common complaints. The author evidently cured himself from a serious case of early onset Alzheimer's, and relates how. He also links diseases with a common cause (e.g. some types of schizophrenia & alzheimer's are linked) and many others.Against:The evidence is anecdotal (i.e. experiences ""This change cured me"") and I would prefer citations of medical research in support of something. If the treatments are as good as implied, a simple trial shopuld prove it."
1,Shiny skin!,"I went to have a bridal makeup trial and the salon I went to used the entire Jane Iredale line. After using this foundation and the powder my face was shiny, and only got worse as the day progressed. It wasn't oily, just shiny, skin was dry to the touch and it felt normal. However as the day went on, my face got worse and worse. My Dad, 8 year old niece and my fiancee all asked me ""why is your face so shiny!""...so I knew this wasn't the makeup for my wedding. However, I will say it DOES stay on forever, I went swimming with it, underwater and all, and all the makeup was intact."
2,Incomplete tv collection,just purchased hopalong cassidy's complete tv collection? after looking at the contents I found that there are 40 tv episodes and 22 of his movie westerns. am I wrong in thinking this was supposed to be his complete tv collection. You are not complete in your details of your ad and I'm very disappointed in your marketing.
1,Nothing like pic,Recevied flag. It is all GREEN. No brown on the football. Very disappointed. The brown football looks awesome in the pic.
1,Unbearable!,"I found this book very difficult to read. It was poorly written and very disjointed. I felt that the author would introduce topics and then never come back to the topics, ie fax machine, finances, awful relationship with her concierge. The book never flowed properly, not a great travel book or memoir."
1,Please don't waste your time...,"Mike was the most likeable person in this story, and he was dead. Try Anne Barone or Sarah Turnbull or Peter Mayle if you want more authenticity and people to whom you think you might possibly relate."
1,Shallow Introduction,"Transaction processing could be a interesting and complex subject, but this book treats it with no deep. If you expect a advanced programmer book about Corba OTS, you will be very disappointed. It is a simplistic introduction instead. Even the 20 pages in ""Enterprise EAI"" by Wrox have more details about OTS than this book on 200.Code examples are astonishing as well. They are based on a case study with transactions only on _one_ database. In real life this would mean that you could avoid distributed transactions and OTS completely. The code would be subject to buffer overflow attacks of the most simple sort by the use of 'sprintf' instead of 'snprintf'. In addition it never becomes clear if the code is using a standard Corba or one of the special features of the transaction libraries used.More advanced topics like programming own 'Resources' and the use of CCS are only mentioned (even saying 'touched' would be to much). Instead there is the 'RTFM' hint."
5,Love this pattern,"I am a faithful Corelle user. When I saw this pattern I had to get it. It is unique but not over the top. I absolutely love my new dishes cannot wait to get the matching additional pieces!!! Just a FYI, I had my last set of Corelle for over 20 years and it still looks great....WOW"
3,Fine,This toy was a rip off she cant even stand up by her self her left leg is so weak but otherwise it was good
5,No more staples!,"Great product for the price. After a year's regular use, it still works great, and saves having to remove staples before shredding."
3,You get what you pay for,"I like that it was colorful & very real looking. I bought this for our 5yr old son for Xmas thinking it would be a little more durable. The chin cracked after just a few days. Also I think it;s too big, like for older kids or adults. If you purchase this item, it's best to use for just a one time thing like Halloween, not for numerous times of dress-up as I had hoped."
1,needs to study comedy,"Bob saget could have been funny if he could learn the first rule about comedy. Delivery is everything, and his was horrible. He reused the same setup and delivery for almost every joke. His material could have been good... if delivered right. He failed horribly"
3,Only for a certain crowd....,"Well I would definitely have to agree with Mr. Graham Scott's review that this type of comedy is only for a small group of people. I honestly did find quite a bit of it lame, but overall I really did enjoy it (but that's me). I rated 3 stars not based on how I enjoyed it, but on the what I believe the actual quality of the set was. And to tell the truth, I think I'll buy a copy of the DVD just to hear ""My Dog Licked My Balls"" lol"
1,no laughs,"Rarely have I watched a one-hour comedy special and never laughed once. So, you're not the nice guy from ""Full House."" WE GET IT. This special is career-endingly bad. Saget is still trying to ride the wave from his ""Half Baked"" appearance and needs to sit down and write some actual material. His friendship with HBO prez Chris Albrecht is the only reason this made it to television. And now it's on DVD?"
3,Great tea pot but our cracked,This is a great and beautiful tea pot which made great tea for us for 2 months. Then it cracked at the top handle connection. I think this tea pot may be too fradgle for daily use - at least in our house.
5,"better than laswell's ""a dub transmission""!","even if buckethead's guitar work isn't the focal point of this cd,and even if you normally don't listen to electronic music this disc if well worth checking out!it has trippy samples and the dj scratches aren't ever ""overpowering"" as they can be on some other dj's albums.it's just a bunch of tripped-out beats that are chilled to the core!a must have for any fan of ""the funk troupe""aka buckethead,bill laswell,bernie worrell,bootsy coolins,george clinton,brain,john zorn,etc,etc,etc.cd's to get with this one are ""shin terrai-unison"",bill laswell/jah wobble-""a dub transmission"",buckethead-""over the slaughterhouse"",and material-""hallucination engine"""
2,Buckethead fan...but not this C.D.!,"I'm a huge Buckthead fan, but I have to agree with someone else's review that I read, It's not for Buckethead fans! There's way too much D.J. going on and a lot of repetivness. Buckethead doesn't even seem to be on the C.D.!"
1,Riddled with inaccuracies,"I opened this book with high hopes, reaching the photograph opposite Chapter 1. It purported to be taken in 1917 of Mack Sennett, directing Zasu Pitts in ""The Little Princess."" Well, no. It is Mack, I will grant you, but he never directed Mary Pickford's ""The Little Princess"", and the lady in the photograph is unmistakably Mabel Normand. (The film, by the way, is ""The Extra Girl"" and no, it was not filmed in 1917!) Of course, everyone can make a mistake, so I turned to another page. There was the Alvarado duplex where William Desmond Taylor met his death: alas, identified as the Brentwood house where Sharon Tate was killed. Ye Gods, did the book not have an editor? Did the editor not have a pulse? A tired rehash of unsubstantiated gossip, this book has some wonderful (but misidentified) photos, and nothing to suggest that we should trust the author. Read Brownlow, find the Kobal collection, but by all means, steer clear of this one."
4,Lost Hollywood Landmarks,"The pictures are wonderful! Most of the main places are covered-the Brown Derby, Garden of Allah, and Pickfair. The author also does a pretty good job explaining all of these forgotten places. Good job."
5,"EXCITING, RICH and SHARP","LOST HOLLYWOOD is a provacative leap into the lives of those titanic silver screen heroes of the 20s and 30s. The place that is now so mythical and cheesy (really little more than nepotism and a sign on a hill) is unearthed by the author, and in this book he makes the romantic and glamorous Hollywood glisten--the legends themselves awakened, jerking, jumping, wailing and playing. Hollywood will once again be the place of dreams because of this book..."
3,"High on interest, surprisingly low on accuracy","I'd be giving this book a lot more love if I felt I could trust it more. The subjects Wallace covers are plenty interesting but so often--too often--I found myself going, ""Really...? Is that the way it happened...?"" A couple of times I checked out a few things and found they didn't hold water. Which is a shame because Wallace writes about such interesting stuff in an engaging way. I just wish he'd spent a bit more time checking his facts. From such books rumors grow. Interesting rumors, but rumors nevertheless."
5,Resting in the love of God,"Rez Band is the music I grew up with as a young Christian.Awaiting Your ReplyandRainbow's Endopened my eyes to the ravages of sin in my relationship with God and with others. Colours was a surprise in the way it grew on me slowly. At first I was not fond of the subtle stylistic change but then the lyrics began to sink in and I began to appreciate the new sound. Colours, especially the title track, leads me to charismatic style dancing and singing worship whenever I hear it and I am not a charismatic! All through the Rez Band albums is that common gritty emotive blues that flowers in Glenn Kaiser's more recent works. This is the music of real life issues, of the dignity of the human being, and of the joy found when we learn to rest in the amazing love of God."
5,Fantastic insight into the early days of Rock & Roll,Travis Fitzpatrick is obviously off to a great career as a writer of biographies. He must have done a great deal of research and have true determination to write a book about events that occurred decades before he was born. Johnnie Johnson's story as the Father of Rock & Roll should be read by anyone who loves music or is interested in its origins.
1,Waste,I payed 50$ for this.It was Horrible!I beat 3 levels one day next day I get stuck on a cruddy level.I Hate being Timed on some of the levels.Real Waste of Money.I f you like Star Wars buy Battlefront.
2,Too big,"This pillow was too big for me and for our bed- I felt like I was trying to scale a mountain. It was far too thick as well, and I couldn't get my head to lie comfortably at the top the way the woman in the photo does. The thing was huge, and is now a bolster. Honestly, I don't know who would actually be a good fit for this, but that's just me (I'm 5' 4"" if that makes a difference?) I got a smaller kidney-shaped Boppy Pregnancy Comfort Cuddle Pillow instead and I am so much happier."
4,Almost perfect,This pillow has dramatically improved my sleep. I just wish it was a little less stuffed.
2,Interesting. . .,"If you are a Michael Bolton fan, by all means, get this CD. Also, if you are open to hearing these traditional opera arias interpreted in, shall we say, a ""different"" manner, this may be the CD for you.HOWEVER, if you are expecting a Pavarotti-like or Domingo-like performance, DO NOT get this.I thought that I was openminded, but just couldn't get into this album. . .hence the 2 stars."
1,A hideous mockery of opera,"While I admire Michael Bolton's other musical endeavors, he has really outdone himself here. He cries, screams, croons and wails through these difficult arias, killing everything that makes this music great. Michael Bolton does have potential in his voice though, but it would take years of voice lessons to reverse his problematic technique. His Italian diction is much better than his singing... better than Josh Groban's.Serious fans of opera will regard this album as nothing more than humorous entertainment. That being said, if you like this music, go listen to recordings of *real* operatic tenors singing it like Corelli, Domingo, or Pavarotti (NOT Andrea Bocelli). Singing opera correctly requires years and years of serious vocal study, not a few months of language coachings and a couple trips to the studio.Sorry Michael, stay in your Fach!"
1,Weird,"It was an experience to listen to Mike doing opera, but I believe he should remain singing pop, what he masters best."
2,"Sorry, Michael......Andrea Bocelli RULES!","I first heard this album in a bookstore and thought that Michael Bolton had changed an awful lot. However, his ""new"" tenor voice just couldn't draw me into it. Yeah, it sounds interesting. But it ain't great comapred to the likes of Enrico Caruso, Franco Corelli, and Richard Tucker, all of who have equally powerful voices. Nor is this side of MB enjoyable comapred to Carreras, Domingo, or Pavarotti, not to mention sexy and worth being drawn to for life like my favorite singer, Andrea Bocelli.Sorry if I offended you, Mr. Bolton, but what in the world happened to the Michael Bolton everyone knew?"
1,"Oh, please, people!","I cannot believe that this horrific dreck got more than two stars from ANYONE, much less people who claim to love opera. This has got to be one of the ugliest recordings of anything outside of Yoko Ono, and it surely is the single worst ""opera"" recording in history. The only things I want to know -- except that Mr. Bolton will never indulge in such a travesty again -- are WHAT was Renee Fleming thinking, and HOW MUCH was she paid to humiliate herself by recording a gorgeous piece like ""O soave fanciulla"" with this talentless lout? I'd give ZERO stars if I could."
4,aren't we supposed to enjoy music?,"I think many reviewers here are being mean spirited. Music is supposed to inspire emotion - happiness is allowed among them- and that ought to apply to performers as well as listeners. Are we all supposed to avoid performing or playing because we aren't the caliber of Maria Callas with voice or Eric Clapton with an instrument?This isn't opera quality, I rather imagine that is why Mr. Bolton is not an opera singer. Other reviewers noted the arrangements and orchestra are masterful and they are - they present these arias brilliantly. This is very well done, a nice collection, pleasant to listen to and I think Mr. Bolton is commendable for pursuing his interests rather than Caruso level perfection. More of us ought to do the same.If you appreciate arias for the stories and the music, rather than for the opportunity that they provide for you to feel superior to mere mortals, I think you will find this collection to be a pleasant way to spend an hour."
3,If you liked Perigeo...,...then this will remind you of them. Mostly the same type of italian fusion band from mid seventies. Nothing new but nicely done and well written tunes.
1,Not this one,"This book is extremely basic (and a bit age-ist). It's fine for someone trying not to look like a fool in their local community theater, but for anyone considering a serious career in professional acting, there are other books that provide a better, more comprehensive, and more practical introduction.I bought this as one trying to return to the field after a long absence, but found ""Breaking Into Acting for Dummies"" to be better instead. For the basics of acting in general, Michael Shurtleff's ""Audition"" is the still the very best investment in a book that you can make."
2,Multicade Cocktail Multi-Game Video Arcade Game,"It has all the games our company wanted, but the playability is poor. Several games are not fully supported by the table's design. Missle Command only has two firing buttons (the third set of missles can't be fired, no trackball makes centipede and milipede very difficult. The short throw on the joystick makes controlling packman difficult. Dazadi did work well in getting the item shipped, communication, and follow up. 5 stars for Dazadi and 2 stars for the item."
5,This One's a Score,"I originally saw this documentary on HBO over a year ago. After watching it, I knew I had to get it on DVD for my daughter for Christmas this year. A truly inspirational story for anyone, but especially for young women, this story of the USA Women's Soccer Team shows their rise from obscurity to glory. My daughter was so captivated by the emotional and educational aspects of the Team's struggle to achieve validation, notoriety and greatness in the historically male centric American sports scene, that she has already planned to have her entire soccer team over to our house for a group viewing to inspire them for the upcoming season."
1,Defective,"Sorry, to say, but the video would not play properly, it keeps skippingand. my 9 year old wondered why Santa would send a broken gift!. Will you replace video?"
5,A truly inspirational film,"This film is as inspirational as any film I have seen. Anyone with daughters, grandaughters, or other young women who enjoy soccer should show this to them. At the price, it would also make an excellant Christmas present."
5,Amazing quality and so fun to play with,"I bought this for my 10 year old son a year ago. This is a most amazing stuffed animal. It's nice to have a stuffed toy that is more ""real"" looking.Eyes - about 3"" diameter. Hard acrylic (?). Great color.Fabric - very soft, low 'pile', like crushed velvet.Body - perfectly stuffed with long arms.My son loves this frog. He is fantastic. His arms are gangly and it's fun because you can put his arm over a chair back and he looks like he's just chilling with the guys. My son frequently puts his jacket on the frog to make him look cool. When he holds the frog up to his body, its feet touch the ground, making him as tall as my son. My daughters now want a stuffed animal like him. This is one of the best toys ever.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a large stuffed animal."
5,A unique take on San Francisco history,"Mr Schimmel, the expert in early trade tokens from San Francisco, takes us on a journey to selected stops in this city's history through these interesting bits of metal. The sites selected are on Streets that have been renamed or have disappeared altogether. Through the tokens that establishments on these streets used, we can hold a tangible reminder of what once was. Highly recommended for enthusiasts of San Francisco history as well as for collectors of tokens and exonumia."
2,Save your $$,"I do not like this game. I'm a big fan of the original B&W but this one just didn't do it justice. You still get to build villages and have worshippers but there are trials now. I've had this game for almost a year and I still haven't passed the first trial. This game is difficult and not very enjoyable. It's not expensive so it's not a huge loss if you buy it, but I suggest to spend your money on something else."
5,A great Mahler 2,"I have never been particularly fond of the Walter or Klemperor recordings of this work. They were graceful and beautiful but I've always felt the work required a far greater sense of drama than they could provide. And so I went to my local record library and listened to as many Mahler 2nds as they had. This one gripped from the first measure. I can't imagine a more exciting and larger than life performance. It must have been performances such as this that catapulted Bernstein into the staure he has today. Do not hesitate to invest in this CD, and certainly pick this recording over the horrendous version Bernstein recorded with the LSO (also on Sony)."
3,Blast from her past!,Loved the woman; love her recipes.WARNING: THEY ARE NOT DIETETIC; so have NO expectations of figure friendly recipes.It wasn't her thing!
4,Worth dipping into.,"Like Poul Anderson's science fiction (although as retold by Günter Grass), this well-researched novel about the Holocaust depicts the moral torments that an agent of the future faces as he derails a group of altruistic time travellers. The groups' plan is to alter history by attacking Nazi death camps and freeing the inmates. Although the brutal contrast of life in Auchwitz retains an intensity far beyond the high-tech milieu of the pursuing time police, it's to the writer's credit that the book's most vivid elements are based in history"
2,pop-up problem,"This canopy has very strong legs but the inner metal work easily bends rendering the canopy virtually useless. The first strong gust of wind and it was over. Yes , it had been staked and weighted , the legs were fine."
1,Poor product,I will say that the product arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately we used it just once. Between the rain coming in and the gust of wind the product was easily damaged. So sad as it was purchased for a non for profit organization for a youth track team.
2,Weight Loss Surgery,"I have done a lot of research on weight loss sugery, as I am preparing to have the sugery done myself. I bought this book in hope of expanding my knowledge on the subject, however the author contridicted most things I have been told by surgeons, and dieticians. I feel she has knowledge on her own personal procedure but made quite a few false statements concerning the other procedures available. I did not find this book helpful at all."
3,solar cover,"Thought I was getting a ""cover"" when in fact it only sits on top of the water, so you have to remove it when it rains and it only heats up to a depth of about 8"". Waiting for cooler temps to see how effective."
2,Not good for long term use,"This was a great cover for our first summer. It warmed our pool nicely, the first few inches or so. The problem happened this year (purchased last summer)-I started noticing the little blue things all in the pool as soon as I covered it this year and didn't think too much of it. A month or so later it just disintegrated. I was putting it on the pool and it ripped every time I tried to roll it onto the over the pool in multiple places. I am very disappointed. It has great reviews and others have said it's worked for multiple summers....we do use a saltwater system, maybe that's the problem..."
3,"Over priced bubble wrap, does the job","It works as advertised, and easy to set.Yet I can't get past the fact that it is an overpriced 12' circle of blue bubble wrap."
3,Good but hard to work with,"this product actually keeps the water warm if the sun shines on it, but its basically a round piece of bubble wrap and floats around on the water. i was expecting it would have some way to attach to the pool. Also taking it off, drying and storing was not easy!!!"
2,Meh.,"We had a hard time getting our pool into a perfect circle so this cover does not cover our whole pool. I can't ""tuck"" it like the directions tell us to. The picture is very deceiving also, I thought it wrapped around the inflated part of the pool. Oh well.."
5,Great Purchase,"We have a small above ground pool (12' diameter) and live in New Mexico. The water in our pool was always very cold until we started using this cover. It does not fit perfectly, being a little small and not quite covering all the water. However,for heating the pool, it has done the trick. There have been evenings I have jumped in the pool with the kids to cool off, only to discover the water was warm to the point of not cooling me off so well. ha. It has increased the comfort of our pool dramatically."
3,intex solar pool cover,"The product is fine. I guess I was just a little disappoined I feel like I really just paid a lot of money for colored small bubble, bubble wrap. It does help keep the pool a little warmer but not as much as I had hoped."
4,Works well,"We live in arizona, the pool cover gets direct sunlight all day. Its surprising how well this works. We actually can put it on in the day time and go in it at night. It can get too hot to be refreshing if you leave it on all day and get in itin the afternoon. Its like a solar hot tub, which some people might like. But when its 110, you want cold water.All in all, very satisfied and as it cools off later in the month, will definitely leave it on most days."
3,Western short stories,I feel that the stories selected for this book of western authors were not their best works. Expected more of Louis L'Amour stories.
3,The title is misleading,I am an intermediate VB programmer. I was a little frustrated reading this book. The book didn't cover much and the explanations were not very clear. I also thought the author did not use a common sense approach of explaining complex ideas by using simple examples. He went the other way.A better book is vb.net codenotes.
3,thrown together,"While the content is in the main useful, this book has clearly been thrown together in a panic to get it out of the door ASAP. There are a number of crucial typo's in the code etc, which make it hard to follow, because your not sure if you're thick or the writer hasn't got a clue what he is on about. There are also a number of factual inaccuracies.Worth a punt for the read, but don't take it as gospel."
2,Inadequate and misleading,"I have been prograaming VB for nine years now and consider myself to be intermediate to advanced. This book simply does not cover the new VB.net in sufficient details. New methods and properties are not explained whilst dealing with other new methods or properties. A good exmaple is the string class. This is not explained, just used, when giving a code example. Also, the examples are incorrect, in many places. I went to the website ... and they hadn't even bothered to correct the code there.I'm sure there must be better books out by now. If"
3,"A bit overpriced, more on the IDE than VB .NET","My first thought, after seeing this book, was what a small book for 40 bucks. After thumbing through the pages, I still think it is a bit small, but I am more impressed with its content.This book, much like ""Designing Visual Basic.NET Applications"", is as much a book on the Visual Studio .NET IDE as it is on Visual Basic .NET. Unlike the aforementioned tome, this book has plenty of screenshots to help you navigate the IDE.In all fairness, there is a good amount of code in this book, for its size. I just wish there were more. If you are looking for an advanced book, look the other way.The saving grace of this book is its help in navigating the Visual Studio .NET IDE. If you want to learn the tool as much as you want to learn the language, this is not a bad buy. For books in this price range the O'Reilly Nutshell book is much better."
3,Quick read with some helpful tips,"I read this book on recommendation of my local librarian. It is a short, easy read with some practical tips on disciplining your children. May not be as useful for parents of very young children (toddler years). I liked the way she gives examples using different aged children from 3 to 12 years old. Many of the ideas are not profound, but provide a fresh approach to methods you may already be using. Lots of good references listed. This book is concise and reassuring, but not for you if you are looking for a deep philosophical read on child rearing."
1,Nutty book,"The premise of this book is that magicians are bad people who are trying to -- gasp -- fool you, and you should be prepared to stop them from doing this by knowing their secrets. The author fails to understand that performance magic is intended to entertain us by mystifying us. Although magic is more than its secrets, without its secrets it can't perform its basic function."
3,Just OK,"I wanted to love this because I love alphabet books and my kid loves trucks, but the prose is so uninspired, the word selections are a mish-mash of vehicles and signs (""K is for Keep Right"") and the illustrations are perfectly nice but not amazing. There's really nothing wrong with this book, but it's not wonderful either."
2,Lame!,"Wendy Harris wrote ""The Bitch and the Bastard"" which was much better than this step-child of a book. Silly characters doing stupid things, and the sex is short, dry, and boring. British sex stories can be amusing and clever and passionate - but not this one."
1,Don't fit,"I've ordered this Oil filter housing cup wrech for my Toyota camry. It doesn't fit although the manuafacture claims it does, waste of money. Now I have to get a cheap plastic one from Canadian Tires"
2,Don't waste your $,"It maybe helped my couch about 10-20%, I do have a deep couch though, so perhaps on a more shallow couch this product would work, although I tend to agree with the person who wrote, ""don't waste your money, just use a piece of plywood"", learn from my mistake, people! :)"
1,Not much support at all --- too thin and too many folds,"This product is way too thin and has too many folds to be able to offer any real support. I purchased both the chair support and the couch support. To feel any sort of difference in the chair, I had to double the seat pad back onto itself. It covered less area, but it doubled the amount of thickness. The couch support was a little better --- mainly because its folds are further apart.And, just one minor thing --- the vinyl covering has a really STRONG plasticy smell.Overall ... my impression was that a BIG cardboard box - folded up - would have provided just as much support."
2,"Not a bad film, but be warned: Subtle Propaganda","Note that the film was made during the wartime period in Bosnia famous for snipers shooting civilians in Sarajevo; the character is a sniper, but shoots hands, objects, and so forth; the killer he serves with in the JNA is a muslim, of course; all the Nationalists that interrupt up the wedding party with a parade are Croats, and no mention is made of Serbian nationalism; the film is an insidious attempt to make all parties equally guilty of human rights violations; a review of who has been indicted at the Hague seems to be in order. ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is better, and less biaised. I'd put this in the category with ""Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"" - a trap for the unwary. (The author lived and worked in Bosnia and Croatia for two years)."
1,Deadly Choice - No Choice,"This story is about a young girl who finds herself pregnant, and is making a decision on whether or not to have an abortion. Unfortunately it focuses on her fears and emotions. There is no help or guidance offered through this story."
1,"Stick to B&G Sprayer, Good for Show","It's very good looking but functuality is far from perfect, it leaks even while just walking with it. The spot thats designed to hold the wand is not great and falls while walking. I can expell 2 gallons in 3 minutes, maybe faster with all the leakage. Also,the pump doesnt add much air I have to keep pumping to get a decent amount in. Plastic tip will break if it hits floor hard. Spend the extra money and get a b&g."
3,Ridiculous and stupid ending,"This title held my attention a little better than some of the previous ones. Hannah is still acting very immature in the romance department and her two boyfriends are so unreal it pains me. It is still very obvious which one is the best match for the cookie baker. However the stupidity in the last two pages just about thoroughly ruined the book for me. All I could do was shake my head and say to myself, ""How dumb can you get? What a ridiculous way to end a story!"""
4,Great Fun!!,Hannah Swensen has done it again. She can solve murder mysteries and bake the best cookies and desserts. Joanne Fluke has written another winner that is fun and doesn't have bad language either. It is pure entertainment as only Hannah Swensen can do.
3,Where's the murder,"Yikes! 200 pages into the story, we finally get to the crime. Since the book isn't that much longer, you can imagine that the solving of the crime isn't the focus of this books. Why not?, is my question. I really like this series, love the recipes, love the characters, but this was definitely the weakest of the series to date. I kept wondering when a crime would be committed, and couldn't believe I was 3/4 through the book by the time it happened.Still, the writing is good, the characters are well developed and there is humor peppered throughout."
2,"Great recipes, lame story","I started reading cozies a few years ago and started with Diane Mott Davidson's Goldie stories. I loved the idea of recipes and murder! I picked up the Hannah Swenson books a couple of years ago and got hooked; Hannah was charming, the recipes were delicious, and Lake Eden seemed idyllic.Unfortunately, the books have become almost a parody of themselves. Everything is simply too... precious. The naivete of the denizens of Lake Eden baffles me- no one seems to do anything vaguely carnal, except indulge in Hannah's baked goods and occasionally murder the random person. Hannah's relationships with Mike and Norman are beyond silly, without a shred of realism. The only saving grace is Moishe!I'm going to stick with ""real"" heroines, I think- crime and love triangles are so much more fun with Stephanie Plum than with Hannah Swenson!"
3,Tried to like..Just couldnt,"Cherry Cheesecake Murder was one of the first culinary mysteries I read. Although I enjoyed the descriptions and theme, I was a let down by the story which ended far too quickly,as thought the author needed a quick ending.I did enjoy the setting and the idea was a good one but it was so drawn out, tried too hard.I will maybe try her other books in the hopes the characters are not so forced and the story a bit more solid.......* Since reading this book I have read others by this Author and decided they are not for me,the writing style and the characters... just try too hard to make the stories work,I could not get in the Carrot cake murder at all, I will look for a culinary cozy author more suited to me."
4,A tasty read,"Cherry cheesecake? I'm in. Especially when an author can combine unique recipes with a murder mystery. What could be tastier than that? I enjoyed the humor laced throughout and the details about the movie biz were interesting too. ALthough I thought it was a little unlikely that a movie production would sweep into town and hire so many of the townspeople to be in the film, I enjoyed the read. Hannah is a feisty character who stands her ground against interested suitors AND her mother. Now, if I could just get someone to make that French toast for me, I'd be set! Looking forward to reading another Joanne Fluke book."
2,Too sweet...,"Joanne Fluke's ""Cherry cheesecake Murder"" is really sickeningly sweet, even for for those with a taste for 'cozy' mysteries, such as I. Even the recipes interspersed throughout go heavy on the sugar and the endorsements for Ghiradelli Chocolates and Hershey Kisses. Then there are all the 'beau's' who are hugging Hannah throughout, though she plays coy and only 'tingles' at their touch. You get the message....and the mystery plot itself is only secondary to the rest of this airy, spun-sugar concoction."
1,The worst!,"Words can barely describe how bad this book is. From the characters to the dialogue to the storyline - from start to finish this is just horrible. Mysteries are supposed to be fun, entertaining, an escape. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to read them, yet the author doesn't have to assume you're too stupid to know the meanings of basic words and phrases. I'd really like to hear from this author why she feels the need to explain everything to the reader. This was a total distraction from the mediocre plot. The murder took place in the last half of the book, and by that point you don't care about it. Hannah is ridiculous, Tracy the niece is not credible, the boyfriends are completely unbelievable, the dialogue is phony, the whole thing is a mess. There are plenty of intelligent, credible mysteries out there that are worth your time. Skip this one."
3,no complaints,Meets the needs. Does not fit on larger whistles.Did not try it on plastic whistle. Might be nice too have more colors.
5,"NOT ""Made in China Firewood""","Yeah... I read the other reviews. Obviously a lot of people have a bug up their arse about things that aren't made in America. I have 3 Dean acoustics (ALL are well made and this guitar is the sturdiest of the 3). Very well put together and once I got it tuned right, it sounds incredible. It is a little hard to tune (had my bottom G string tuned to G sharp... messed up the entire sound...was driving me nuts) but if you can't get it a guitar shop will be happy to help. I don't know if I got lucky, but the strings are actually in great shape. I'm sure new, better strings will make it sound even better. Listen to the good reviews... this is a well built and strong, rich sound and a great looking guitar. Worth every dime."
3,Interesting but ending far-fetched,"I spent 4-tours in Korea 65 thru 81. Am familiar with and could relate to many of the locations and operational aspects of the book, but while it held my interest for the first 200 pages or so, the ending in Pan Mun Jom became somewhat far-fetched, unrealistic, and disappointing. The ending could not/would not have happened in the manner depicted."
2,Not good for small animals.,I bought this screen cover to use on a 10 gallon tank with a small snake. The hatch does not secure flush with the rest of the screen cover and can be easily pushed up to allow small animals such as snakes and geckos to escape. I would not recommend using this screen cover for any animal that can fit through small spaces.
5,"My child has a flopadoodle cow for 7 years of her life, buying a few others to complement","Floppadoodles are the BEST ""lovie"" toys for kids. They are very durable and lovable. This purple dragon is exceptionally cute!"
4,Does the trick,These GMC car mats work well and the quality is fine for the price. I kind of wish the color was a closer match to the factory tan carpet of that model/yr GMC.
4,Really nice mats,"Great floor mats. I like the customizeable feature. Easy to clean. Reasonably priced, they do a great job. They match my interior nicely."
4,Great Game!,"Great Game, but it only gets 4 stars because your player can get stuck in certain areas of the scenery."
4,Awesome Game,"This Game is awesome! I love that you can buy supplies, veicles, and air strikes! It is cool how there is two areas to cause havic in. One downfall to the game is that it says you can drive any veicle you can get to well that is false. You can get rigt net to a jet but you can fly it! If your going to say that you can drive ant veicle you can get to you should be able to drive any veicle you can get to! You also can get on a boat but you can't drive drive it. But other than that this is a solid game. Here is how I look at the game:GTA + Army = Mercenaries"
4,The Best Special Herbs yet!,"It comes as no surprise that Metal Finger's latest addition to his Special Herbs collection is his best. MF Doom has evolved nicely over the years. His rapping and production has always been a step above it's predecessor. Here we have several untouched beats and instrumentals that Doom has backed on several of his proper albums, and some you may have never heard. Volume 9 kicks off with the pure beauty of ""Vinca Rosea"" and ""Burdock Root"", then dives into the familiar ""Vervain"" (""Beef Rap"" from MM.. Food). ""Bergamont"" and ""Untitled (Meditation)"" are the standouts on volume 9, and ""Peach Extract"" is probably my favorite throughout. The last half is a little more funked up. This is ultimately the most unique ride Doom has taken us on, through his moody and relaxed production. His style is simply untouched and completely original. Underground hip-hop heads interested in hearing some quality hip-hop instrumentals should definitely check this release out."
5,Nice little compass,"I purchased this for my daughter to complement our map studies. It works well, and it's easy to use and carry with her."
4,its cheap and it works.,there are nicer compasses out there. i havent really put its durability to the test. but it seems to be about right for the price. it will hold up for what ever you need and the needle is accurate. what else to you want.
5,Aquatics - Applied Study Guide and Self-Tests,"This is a very informative and supportive book. Ruth has done an excellent job, again!"
3,interesting listening,"I bought MDI vol 2 because I wasn't terribly dissapointed by vol 1. In terms of overall sound the two releases are unfortunately similar, although vol 2 does show some improvements, but both contain tracks that are excessively distracting through un-dubbish jarring musical transitions and overly repetitive tropes, which are problems that are not excused by ""that is the dub sound"" claims, but understandable over a continuous two-disc listening session."
2,Look elsewhere,"Lackluster electronic beats, often aggrevatingly disharmonic without being interesting. The music sounds like something a beginner at drum machines would achieve. Its sound come close to the feeling of ""I'm out 20 bucks."""
4,High end prog rock at it's best!,"The second album from German progressive rock powerhouse TRIUMVIRAT. Good solid album that hasn't been available for quite some time. The new reissue remasters are top quality and the bonus tracks are fun, but nothing stellar. If you like early 1970's progressive rack ala Emerson Lake and Palmer, you will love Triumvirat! I recommend this disc, Spartacus and Mediteranian Tales for you Triumvirat prog rock fix."
4,Robeson on wax,"I found this album in a thrift store last week, for a couple of dollars. It's the original pressing on four 78 RPM records, in a gatefold format. It's in pristine condition. I really bought it for the incredible cover art, although I hope to be able to listen to it in this format at some point."
2,"Cool, but color faded fast","Love the concept, but the pretty pink faded very very fast. Wish it was better made, the pink made it stand out beautifully. Now it just looks cheap."
2,Disappointimg,"Color faded within two weeks. More narrow than expected. Love the sentiment, but can see that this will not hold up."
3,Fun quote,"This is one of my favorite quotes. The correct quote is ""Well-behaved women SELDOM make history.""Close enough.The woman who wrote it is Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a Harvard professor.My second favorite quote is from Alice Roosevelt Longfellow. ""If you haven't got anything nice to say about anybody, come sit next to me.""My third favorite quote is by Teddy Roosevelt. Well, another time.(I edited this to correct her name.)"
3,Good Sweater Patterns,"This book is more of a stitch library than a reference manual for crochet. This is definitely not a beginner's book. I haven't completed any of the projects yet, but I think it will be essential to complete the afghan before you can really work any of the sweater patterns, You will need to get experience with the different stitches. Great book for a crocheter's library, but I prefer the sweater patterns in ""Crochet With Style"" by Melissa Leapman."
3,Beginners Only,"This book might be a good thing for a beginning crocheter... but there really isn't a lot here for an experienced one. The designs look better on the afghan they have than made up into sweaters on the model. I've had the book a long time, and have yet to make anything from it."
3,Not for beginners...,"I'm trying to teach myself to crochet -- through books, as I know no one who can teach me. This wasn't, for me, a book that helped me learn to crochet. Beginners might want to try another book, although I'm sure this is a great book if you already know something about crochet. It has beautiful patterns."
1,plastic covering has eye burning smell-am returning,plastic covering on this item has an eye burning smell to it. am returning it. have found this in other made in China plastic or rubberized stuff.
5,sofa seat support,This has nicely eliminated the uncomfortable sag that made getting up difficult and sitting unpleasant. It doesn't show and was simple to use.
5,Much superior to Lao Tzu,"Again, this is a book about practical taoism. I am not saying that readers should avoid Lao Tzu, but they should also read other taoist books which better explain how to include taosim in everyday life. Do avoid Ms Wong's version though: she takes too much liberty with the text."
2,Very disappointed,This item looks nothing like the photo and was in terrible shaped when it arrived. I rinsed with cold water like the intructions said and put it in the tank hoping for the best. The thing half fell apart in the water and I had to actually change out my filter because of all the mess this one thing caused. I would not recommend this to anyone
4,Great fun read,"I enjoy Elizabeth Bevarly's books and this was no exception. It's a sort of sequel to ""A Doctor in her Stocking"" which tells the story of Seth's best friend Reed. In Seth's book, he plays husband to nurse Prudence Halloway, who is going to her high school reunion, and in the process, they fall in love."
5,best roller for the best price,"owner of 2 18 yr old furballs. I buy these by the case. I have one in every room. The price here is as much as 70% less than in stores! I sometimes brush my cat and then lint roller him, he LOVES it. ONLY do this on short hair cats!"
3,"Interesting, but not that good","Yes I know this was one of the first important grunge bands, yes I know Stone and Jeff from Pearl Jam were in Green River but come on this ain't that amazing as some of you have stated. It's interesting to see how to grunge sound or whatever it is called nowadays has evolved from this but the music is really so/so some songs rock, but it's pretty much redondant and boring. I guess I expected too much, I mean c'mon Stone and Jeff are great musicians but they're talent isun't displayed constitantly throughout the album, only in short spurts. I'll give Green River credit, they most likely influenced a good deal of bands with they're approach, I just couldn't get into it is all. So if you've heard this band before and like what you've heard than I'm sure you'll like this album alright, luckily from the ashes of the band we got MudHoney and later on Pearl Jam."
3,For a $.99 item...,the shipping could have been cheaper. But it definitely works for the Samsung Sync A707
2,The Secret is ... This is not a Good Concealer,"I am a concealer junkie. Always searching, and paying top dollar to find the concealer of my dreams.I am a bit over 40 and have hereditary dark rings under my eyes, in addition to some wrinkles.LM's secret concealer has a dense, dry consistency. It is not easy to apply. I have to scoop a bit out and warm it in the palm of my hand. This helps it glide on.But it still does not cover to the degree I need. It also tends to get cakey and settle into wrinkles -- something a concealer should never do.And the color selection is too narrow. I suppose if you really like the concealer, you could by two or three and blend them to suit your complexion.But for me, this product did not work on all accounts. I'm only giving it two stars cause I'm such a huge fan of LM, otherwise it would get 1 star."
2,ok,"Not much better than concealers I have bought at a drugstore. It sometimes even gets cakey and I don't really even put on that much. Of course I did not buy the overpriced applicator brush so maybe that's the reason, I don't know. They want too much money for this product in my opinion."
1,Not Massive Attack Not Dub,"I've been listening to MA for 8 years, I've had this album for 4.This is neither good as Massive Attack nor as dub. Applying echo and reverb to a track doesn't make it dub.This album deconstructs Protection, but doesn't reconstruct in an interesting way like a remix is supposed to.Mad Prof's skills are dubious in this dub. Why didn't they ask Jack Dangers to do it?"
4,excellent remix album,"Massive Attack's stunning musical brilliance at its peak. Trip-hop brought to a new level along with the genius of Mad Professor. Notably, the most interesting tracks were the remixes of Karmacoma and Cool Monsoon. A must for MA fans or anyone who appreciates trip-hop as an art"
2,"Captivating, but incredibly disappointing","Well, I couldn't put the book down. Picked it up on a Saturday and finished in on a Monday. The problem was that I was pissed at myself and even more pissed at Baldacci that I wasted two days reading this tripe. Most of the reviewers on this site are either on narcotics or on Baldacci's payroll. What could have been an amazing book, beginning to end, turned into one of the great clunkers of all time. This book has about the most insultingly inane ending of any suspense/thriller I've ever read. I'll have to think twice before I read a Baldacci novel again."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See book summary above.I've read all of Baldacci's books. What he's served up here is not your highly suspenseful thriller or a fast-paced shoot'em up. Instead what you get is a slowly unraveling mystery (and I mean slow), the type of which many authors write. Some people may love this kind of novel, but I don't.It's not what I expected, but as far as straight mystery goes, it works."
2,Disappointing mystery thriller,"Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELLand THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MANSTANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I justheard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thrillerabout two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together tosolve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of thecharacters, and there were far too many subplots floating aroundfor my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it broughttoo many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly,I did not particularly ""buy"" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn'tall that believable."
3,Fair,"Tried this because Baldacci was recommended by a friend and this is the first in his ""Sean King/Michelle Maxwell"" series. Characters are appealing, if not very deeply drawn. Plot is improbable but interesting. Good enough that I'm going to try next in the series."
5,Great Baldacci book!,"I really enjoyed this book! Compared to other Baldacci novels, this is the most like ""Last Man Standing"", which I alse thoroughly enjoyed. I wish this book were a little bit longer page-wise, because I didn't want it to end."
1,Thanks,Just a thank you note to the reviewers: you have saved me from wasting my money on this book. Many thanks for your honest and insightful comments.
2,Good book but torn in shipment,This is a very good book! I was disappointed with Amazon as the cover was torn when I received. I purchased this as a new book...
1,illogical,"The premise for this book is totally stupid. I finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't.SPOILERAn example of how dumb: Two high level secret service agents find a weapon put it in the glove compartment of their car. Do not lock the glove box, don't lock the car. It gets stolen while their in the house. Is this dumb or what?"
3,Split Second gave me a splitting headache,"David Baldacci is a excellent writer and storyteller, and is one of my most favorite authors. I have missed many meals and hours of sleep because of his books.Split Second was no exception. It was entertaining, intriguing, suspensful and thrilling.But it is not is Baldacci's greatest and could have done with out a few characters and a few gruesome details (i.e. hanging bodies). The end was exciting, and I don't care that it was a little unrealistic. My biggest beef is that is was so darn complicated. My head is still spinning from all that went on at the end, and I still don't really know exactly what happened.Die hard Baldacci fans will certainly find this book a good read, but will feel a little disappointed that it is not up to the caliber of his previous works."
2,A Bitter Disappointment,"This was certainly not Baldacci's best work. Being a huge fan of his, I had high hopes for his newest thriller, but it was a let down from the first page. I had to force myself through the whole book, only to find out that the ending was supremely canned. The story line did not grab me despite this being my favorite genere. In fact, I read the whole book feeling as if I had read it before - there was nothing original or interesting about the plot or characters and it left me wishing I had picked up something else instead. I can only hope that this is his only low point in his writing, because ordinarily his books are real page turners."
3,Good mystery.,"The ""loops"" and ""twists"" of the characters made fascinating reading. Kept me on my toes and my interest was always peeked."
2,Not his best,"Baldacci's writing style is engaging, so his books are fun to read, BUT the plot on this one is totally unbelievable. Call for the coincidence police! Just your typical insane genius revenge plot. (I don't think I just gave away the plot)..."
2,THUD!,"Ouch, I've always enjoyed Baldacci but this book has some of the most stilted dialogue I've ever read. The book starts out great then coasts into a haze that it never recovers from. I re-read some of the dialogue about halfway through the book and couldn't believe what I was reading - like bad high school creative writing. This is only one half of what could've been a really good book. I'll give Baldacci another chance if he'll write a complete book."
3,"fun, easy read, intriguing, but lacks something","I enjoy increasing my vocabulary as I read. This book didn't challenge me in that aspect. I like following plots, deciphering clue, guessing the ending. Baldacci drops enough hints yet the ending seems believable only if one is as demented as the arch villain. The story maintains a high level of suspense throughout. At times the agents follow dead ends or scant clues but that is life in the FBI and Secret Service at times. Baldacci uses too much dialog which doesn't develop enough depth for some of the characters. Overall, a good choice if you want an exciting read where you don't need to engage your brain. Just enjoy the plot, don't try to figure it out."
2,Disappointing...,"After having read Baldacci's ""Camel Club"" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really ""know"" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article..."
3,Split Second,I have always enjoyed reading David Baldacci novels. I found this one predictable and a bit labored in patches. Still a good read though.
4,Loved it right up to the end,"The main characters are well drawn, the mystery held my attention, it was exciting and fast paced, but the ending was not plausible. It was bizarre and, to my way of thinking, implausible. The villain was crafty, evil, and with no redeeming qualities. In fact the villain seemed to be right out of a Batman movie."
4,"That split second that determines your life, and the lives of others","Baldacci's presentation of that ""Lord Jim"" moment, the moment that determines the course of your life, is told quite well. Two of these moments, actually. It's an interesting story about two Secret Service agents, one male and one female, who both make split second mistakes, and their attempt to redeem themselves by finding out who kidnapped a presidential candidate. Again, however, I wish the author had condescended to include explicit lovemaking scenes between the two agents. What does it take to get an R-rated book these days anyway?"
2,The (Rube) Goldberg Variations...,"The fiendishly clever and unbelievably intricate master plan of the villain makes no sense and requires a thousand quirky circumstances to converge even to make it creak to the finish line; the supposedly superior law-enforcement characters make the same mistakes over and over and over and over again; no one seems to be motivated by any detectable purpose; the ending seems to take forever. There are huge hunks of expository dialogue where characters recap everything that's happened so far and what it all might mean. This reads like a book written by committee from a plot outline by Rube Goldberg.It did want me to buy Sean King's house, though. ;)"
1,Totally implausible,"I wanted to really enjoy this book, and I will admit that the first half was entertaining. But the conclusion of this story is totally implausible. Far too many lose ends --plotlines that took chapters to build-- get wrapped up in one or two paragraphs. And all of the ""evil"" characters are totally ridiculous. They are totally one-dimensional and unrealistic, like something out of the comic books I read as a boy.I couldn't wait to finish this trainwreck, but I kept hoping for something better.I want my eight dollars and six hours of my life back."
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE",I gave this 1 star only because there's no provision for No stars. This is an exceedingly amatuerish book in all respects. YUCK!
5,You'll never go hungry again!,"I checked this cookbook out of the local library to see if there was anything my kids could cook and would like to eat. Wow! We've been cooking up a storm and loving it all. This book may be for kids, but it works wonders for any novice cook. You'll feel like a true chef after just one mouth watering recipe!The recipes are tasty, pretty easy, and very well explained. My only complaint is that the graphics are cartoony -I'd much rather see real photos. That said, I'm ordering this cookbook myself because there are just too many good recipes to copy them down!"
4,Great for kids!,My kids loved this book and had lots of fun trying different recipes. It didn't take them long to test us all with their new found talents.
4,as listed,"The product came quickly and in pretty good shape. It was from a library, so there were a few pages that were torn, but in otherwise great condition! We already started cooking out of it! Thanks!"
2,Very dull,"As already mentioned, this is a highly forgettable release. If you're looking for 'UNKLE ENTERTAINMENT' this ain't for you!"
3,NOT a 2-pack,"Filter is fine, but you are not getting a 2-pack, so don't be fooled by the incorrect title for the product."
1,Only 1 hood filter came... it is labeled as a 2-pack,"The product itself was perfectly fine. However, given that it is sold as a 2-Pack, I cannot give it more than 1 star: there was only 1 range hood filter in my shipment."
2,Not up to snuff.,"This album did little to impress me as I was with the composers Spice Perfumes Toxins, whixch still hasn;t been recorded."
4,Scholarly AND readable!,"Professor Laband draws on his extensive knowledge of late 19th Century South Africa to trace the origins and course of the lesser-known, but politically significant conflict between the Boers of the South African Republic (a.k.a. the Transvaal) and British colonial forces. Deftly defining the war as a collision of two radically different military cultures, he takes a middle path between traditional historical perspectives, which have often taken either the Afrikaner view of a divinely-ordained victory, or the British outlook, which regarded its defeat as an aberration in the largely-triumphant advance of British rule.Laband clearly describes the events preceding and during the war, so that those less familiar with figures and issues of that era in this part of the world will gain an understanding of a pivotal point in British-South African relations."
3,Triumvirat's Swansong LP Gets a Facelift,"If you're reading this at all you're probably already a fan, and know that this LP represents for many people, myslef included, the absolute nadir of Triumvirat's seven-album oevre. 'Russian Roulette' was Jurgen Fritz' sonic adventure in Hollywoodland with crack L.A. session players (members of the supergroup Toto), and for many listeners was too much a departure from the ELP-ish prog style to which we'd become accustomed. The up-side is that this EMI remaster gives the tracks great punch. Triumvirat completists will want this right alongside their copy of 'Pompeii'."
2,Too old to help much,"I should have gotten a more recent edition so now I have both, but will not make that mistake again."
1,Love story,I tried to play this in my DVD player and it wouldn't play. This was not made for an american DVD player :( I will be returning it.
1,A horrendous historical distortion.,"This book was a terrible compolation of ridiculous fact and capricious opinion. The author, clearly a pompous man, makes enormously random and unfounded claims. His theories are ignorant and foolish, accompanied by tedious and gramatically poor writing. Truly an atrocious piece of writing."
3,One Meandering Hour,"I've liked Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius's work for years, since discovering it back in the 1970s. But during the 80s, they went on a long hiatus following the release of ""Curiosum"" and this, the first album since that one, really doesn't satisfy. Cluster's music went thru numerous changes, from spook-house terrornoise in their first incarnation with Conny Schnitzler, thru proto-industrial ambience on their ""Cluster"" and ""Cluster II"" albums, then into total electro-bubblegum with ""Zuckerzeit"" to splash down into ambient music with ""Sowiesoso"", the cinematic ""Grosses Wasser"", and ""Curiosum"" and their Eno collaborations. But this...is odd. Annoying, even, as everything else Cluster did had a certain terse, concise beauty to it. This is neither terse nor concise, but meandering and seemingly unfocussed. There does seem to be a certain flowing logic to it, but one really longs for a jump back to the ways of those earlier releases. Very troubling."
4,"A political, but meaningful book","This book is extremely political throughout and although I'm not exactly into politics, if you are then this book is for you. Overall though, it was extremely good. The underlining theme and the most significant quality in this book is that of no matter what happens, stand up for your Lord at all costs. The people in this book are willing to give up everything for their Lord. It also hits abortion pretty hard and makes you realize that it IS MURDER! This book, indeed, does not have an exactly good ending, but it teaches you alot."
2,Disappointment,"This is the worst of Meryl Sawyer's books I've read so far. The characters are flat and the story line not credible. The first half of the book drags, while Sawyer rushed to finish off the book in the second half. A big disappointment."
1,Looks good but only temp settings are hot and hotter,"I have the stainless steel version of this range. After burning more meals then I want to admit, I contacted the company. I was told ""We do not manufacture the Smoky Mtn Range here at our factory, it is imported. We have recently discontinued carrying this item. We have found the problem that it only has one heat setting. I am sorry for the inconveniences this may have caused. But at this time we do not have any adjustments for the grill. """
5,Good feeling knife.,"I was looking for a modern style Sgian Dubh (essentially a Scottish boot knife) to carry when wearing a kilt. I bought 3 different knives to see which one I liked and this one won out. The ""Sting"" is all one solid metal piece, has a good weight and comes with velcro straps to attach the sheath how ever you want to carry it. The sheath is very secure and the knife could be carried upside down with no problem. If i had to point out one possible down side is that the handle surface is completely smooth, and I suppose your hand could slide toward the blade if cutting with some force.The other knives I bought wereCold Steel Brave Heart Kraton Handle (SecureEx Sheath)andCold Steel FGX Skean Dhu with Kraton Handle"
3,Good backup knife,One piece design is heavy but tough. I prefer knives such as the Gerber guardian compared to this knife but it is good quality. This knife is U.S. design but made in China (according to the box). For the money it is a good value and it seems like a rugged design to take some abuse.
5,Great knife,Solid feeling quality knife. Works well sideways on my belt. Don't even know its there and the sheath keeps it very secure.
5,Surprisingly Good,"I have to say I did not expect this knife to be as good as it is. It is very solid and sharp. The straps are comfortable and the knife is held very securely. That last part I never would have expected but it will not fall out unless maybe you have it strapped on upside down and and were flailing around, and even then that seems unlikely. The only problem is that it is not the most comfortable knife to hold. It just feels a little odd, but it is a small price to pay for such a securely sheathed, and well built knife."
4,Bit disappointed in the ending,"I'm not going to give a recap of the story since several have done it already, but I will say that it kept me pretty interested throughout the entire book. I was excited to see her conversion, but it never really came. One minute she was in denial, and the next she had faith...That really disappointed me. I thought the ending was really weak as well...There was no admitting to love, and I do NOT believe the preacher should have even been thinking about marriage yet His spiritual life was stable and strong. Hers was fresh and new. I think they needed to really take things slow and think on things...But the story itself - surrounding Stacy and the wedding - was sweet."
4,old time watering can,"all in all a great METAL watering can, just like your grandfather used to have. holds 10 qts of water, so enough to get alot of plants done, but not so much that you can't lift the device.the only draw back is that i can't get the diffuser spout off the neck, as sometimes i want ALOT of water for one particular plant at one time. but besides that, it is a good watering can"
3,Nice tool,The wand works great for reaching plants at a distance but the water supply doesnt shut off when the trigger is released so moving between plants you will have some leakage.
1,MISHANDLING GOD'S WORD.,"MISHANDLING GOD'S WORD.Reckless drivel.Inaccurate Biblical interpretation is deadly, ETERNALLY.Try Dr. John Macarthur and John Piper for life changing, inspirational and God honoring Biblical TRUTHS."
4,Thinkpad 90W AC/DC Combo Adapter,"Overall I like the adapter, am using it for my Thinkpad X60. Since no other travel adapter seems to have tips available yet, it is the only one available. The only downside is the size. The power unit is a bit larger than the iGo or Kensington, which is what I had previously. Other than that, it works great."
4,UltraSound AG-30,Using this with a Martin nylon guitar and am generally pleased with its performance. Does a good job for every day playing and practice but a bit too underpowered for anything beyond that. Only regret is that it doesn't have built in reverb but I knew this when I purchased it. Overall a good value for the price.
4,Good But not the best,the Book was good but i do wish they showed the picuter of the second ball whith cinderella in her gown
2,Waste of Money and Time,"I tried to use the clicking system but my Westie just gave me the middle paw. I passed it along to a friend who just got a new pug. If all else fails, it's good for annoying a speaker at a seminar."
5,Do not buy the dog bone ones,"I did some reading on the clicker method of training and was so excited to begin with our 10 month old dachshund and 9 year old yellow headed Amazon that I ran out and bought one of those yellow dog bone ones at PetCo. It was a piece of junk; not loud enough to use outside when doing leash training and it could barely be heard over normal house hold conversations.So, I found this one on Amazon and in reading the reviews another person had the same problem with the dog bone ones. So I ordered it and just got it today and it is a wonderful clicker. Fits nicely into your hand, the button is easy to find and it makes a nice loud click that can be heard inside and out over normal conversations yet it is not so loud as to scare our somewhat skittish parrot.I would recommend this highly."
5,Very good,"Using this clicker I was able to teach my dog Poppy so many tricks. Glad I bought this! The clicker was very loud and my dog was able to catch on to the click, treat method better than using my voice. Would definitely recommend this to people who want to teach their dogs new behaviors."
4,Click away,I'm sure this is a good clicker but I decided not to use it. My granddaughter loves to click it.
1,this is awful.,"Its just a little piece of foil in a plastic casing, doesn't even come with a way to tie around your wrist. What a waste of 5 bucks really. Its not loud enough to be attention grabbing either."
5,IT WORKS!,"My dogs are positively baffled by the clicking and it shuts them up right away - yappy pomeranians, no less! I attached it to their leash. I think their barking has improved in general just having this around."
5,Best one I ever used,"I purchased this to help trin my dog it is made of a very durable plastic. It makes a good sharp ""click"" sound when used, perfect for marking a dog's behavior. It has an open area for a lanyard but alas it comes with no lanyard nor is one offered so I ordered one separately which is a little inconvenient. Overall though I gave it as 5/5 becasue it's perfect for dog training and works as promised."
4,Better than you think,"This clicker sells for over 5 dollars in a store, so this was a very good deal! If you like to train dogs, this is a good tool to use."
3,"Clicks fine, training???","I bought this to train my dog with, and it sure does what it says, delivers clicks, but my dog never responded well to the training. It might work with a younger puppy, but my dog laughed at me!"
2,Way too loud and scary for a small dog,"I purchased this clicker because I wanted to try training my dog for a few simple things. I never really understood the clicker system, but a friend told me I should buy one because it worked wonders for her. Well, I completely regret wasting the money on this thing. I have a chihuahua, and he's definitely not the nervous type. However, when I first clicked this thing, it was so loud that he shot out of the room. I couldn't even get near him with the clicker in my hand because it freaked him out. I tried holding it a different way, as some of the reviews suggest, to soften the sound with my palm, but it was still too loud for him. I think maybe for a bigger dog, it might not be that big of a deal, but if you have a small dog, I do not recommend this clicker. Check your local stores and try to find one that won't scare your dog."
3,Not the exact color purchased,"I kept the item even though it was not the exact color/item purchased. It was acceptable since I purchased it before with another seller, and the item was off from the description purchased."
5,Beloved Keyboard Concertos by Father/Son Team,"Recently I heard the first movement of J.S.'s harpsichord concerto in D and instantly fell in love with it. So, upon surveying the field for this work, found this recording by Leonhardt to be well received as well as the right price.Am not disappointed with it either, as the sound, pace and articulation on this is exceptional.Of course, I am totally impressed with the Allegro of J.S.'s with its grandeur. Interesting the evolution here from violin concerto to harpsichord, which occured in the 1730's.Harpsichord was one of Bach's favorites, and the influence he gave to this unique sounding instrument continues to flourish. His son carries on that tradition admirably with his concerto offering on this disc.This is well worth having for baroque devotees in their collection."
3,Not a military book,"If you're interested in really finding out how General Giap masterminded the military victory in Vietnam, this book isn't going to answer the question. Instead, Giap takes the opportunity simply to reinforce the stated political positions of the Vietnamese communist movement in book form in a way that's not particular original or well-written.If you're a communist, you'll probably enjoy saying ""Right on!"" as he makes an endless stream of broad generalizations about the political side of the victory, but if you're interested in finding out about what Giap is truly a genius at doing, fighting a guerilla war, you won't really find this book satisfying."
1,Horrible Remake of a great song,I really prefer the original version. You just can't compare this to each other. It's just nothing special now. The original from 1994 was a special song in a way that never had been heard before... Beside this the new female singer doesn't get really high like the original one
5,mixer,"this mixer and cup has worked great for mixing my protein drink everyday, it seems very durable, and i hope to be using it for a very long time."
5,interestingly profound book,"First off, the book itself was in very excellent condition. The books content is a very somber and hideous account of one of the most tragic and horrifying murders of young kids this country has ever seen. From 1971 to 1973 many young teen-agers met the end of their lives in very torturistic ways. Any-way, This case was not widely reported back then. By todays standards of media reporting; this case would have been front page news for literaly 6 months or more. Never a more sinister serial killer than this guy, Dean Corll.(The sickest of the sick) for sure. Lanc B."
4,Captivating Read,"Ths is another good addition to the Year of Living Dangerously. SPEAR Agent Russell Devane pursues Simon by working at Simon's daughter, Lise Meldrum, Cattle Station in Australia. Lise Meldrum, who knows nothing of her father's machinations, is strong, likable, innocent, and questions her worth due to her father's lack of love for her. Russell Devane is captivated by Lise, and gets emotionally involved.I only found two negatives. One, this book could have been written on any cattle ranch (not much specific to Australia). Two, everything just seems to come together in the end too easy, but this is a romance after all!Besides this, this book was a great read. It will stay on my keepers shelf!"
3,Okay for a quick overview,"A slender book that has some good information and interesting illustrations, but about one-third of the book is devoted to ""famous"" Scots-Irish and the historical information is superficial. Probably meant for younger readers, might be best for a quick overview, particularly since it often sells for under $1."
5,Chapter 5 (Hidden),"The famed X series fifth installment, X 2007, is an amazing album. Go pick up a copy for your own ears. You will be pretty ecstatic with the result.Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"
3,Indencent Seduction,I was so excited to see this movie when i saw i could buy it!! i got it home & watched it but was definatly not how i remembered seeing it when i was 16. this is a good movie especially if you have young teenage girls. i do recommend this movie to anybody!
5,trip down memory lane,"The McCartney YearsI gave this 5 stars just for the 8 songs from rockshow.1976 OR SO I WENT TO SEE WINGS AT THE WASHINGTON DC CENTER FRONT ROW "" PAUL ROCKED OUT AND THE BAND WAS TIGHT. THE REST OF THE STUFF IS NICE TO HAVE AS WELL, GOOD JOB......"
2,Beware of PAL versions,"I received a PAL version, Warner Bros. DVD would not play on USA playersMenus did not work propThis could have been a great DVD set; It's notIf you want to see how it should have been done; buy and watch the excellent Beatles Anthology DVD set!Hopefully someone a MPL Productions will hire a real video guru to make a definitive Paul McCartney box set of DVDThe commentaries by Sir Paul are the best part; I especially liked the one of him on the South Kensington Tube Line."
2,A Joke...,"If you don't know much about McCartney/Wings, and only know them for their greatest hits, this package may be for you... For ""us"" 1st generation and serious collectors and Beatles' historians, this package is an insult... Where are the Wings years? Where is that ever elusive Wings' debut party/performance video (which much exist somewhere as we've seen snippets of it in very HQ... Rockshow should have been included in its entirety... One Hand Clapping and/or snippets of it... This could have been as extensive as a 4 to 5 disc set and we would have gladly paid for it... McCartney made the terrible mistake of leaving the project entirely to a third party and giving them free reign as to what to include... I DO have it, only because I'm a completist, but what a BIG dissapointment this was... Two stars is more than it deserves... This was your big chance Macca to leave a great souvenier of your musical travels and greatness... It can still be rectified tho' (hint, hint)..."
5,DVD a must have for McCartney fans,"A very excellent DVD of McCartney, showing live clips of his performances with Wings, and other scenes. The DVD quality is excellent, and it shows the brilliance and sagacious insight of the quality of his music. A must have for all McCartney fans."
3,Worth it just for the DTS Mix,"This is a nice set, incomplete, but nice. I could've done without all the videos for the newer stuff. First of all, I'm not a big fan of videos, live stuff would be better, and second of all, Paul hasn't done much worth buying since the Back To the Egg album.The kicker on this set is if you have DTS 5.1 surround sound in your system, because listening to the classics in that format is AWESOME. I REALLY wish they would've put the entire Rockshow on here. What a tease! But to FINALLY hear at least SOME of this concert in 5.1 DTS is wonderful. Another piece I would've loved to have seen again was the Back to the Egg TV promo. I remember seeing it when the album came out, but I'm afraid it is lost to history. Too bad. All in all a nice set, but could've been better."
4,Good text that is practical & has a grasp of the arts spirit,"A good basic text on the Sikh martial art of Gatka. Weapon-based with fluid, dance-like moves. Has a lot in common with Escrima (Philippines). Includes a wealth of B&W photos. The only problem I have with the work is the New Age overtones in the opening section. On the whole a good look into the art of Gatka."
2,Not for Mountain Bike,I have one of these on my road bike and it works really well (survived a crash) but an identical one on my mountain bike broke after 2 rides on rough trails. Probably not built to withstand the constant torture from a mountain bike.
3,Tango Great/ New Age Music No/ Strange Mix,"If you love tango music, you will love the classic pieces here, but be prepared to have the interspersed New Age musical tracks jar you out of your tango mood. About every other track is insipid modern background music of no distinctive interest. Keep your finger on the skip button. Enjoy the tango numbers of Hugo Diaz, Anibal Troilo, Juan D'Arienzo, Osvaldo Pugliese, and the nuevo tango composer and performer, the famous Astor Piazzolla....The liner notes are excellent....I have not seen the movie so I am judging the soundtrack on its own merits as I see them, independent of the film itself."
4,Excellent commentary,I would have to say that this book has excellent commentary about the financial situation in the 20's and 30's which I have not found anywhere else. There are also some short biographies of which the best was about Henry Kaiser. I enjoyed reading it and liken it to the book Market Wizards only this is about money wizards. Matthew Josephson is a great writer and I believe that anyone who enjoy's learning about the financial markets and what makes the economics of a nation tick will enjoy this book and also learn a few things in the process. I must note though that I found myself skimming parts of the book which were maybe too detailed. Overall it still rates very good.
3,1997 Symphony by Tan Dun,"When I first heard the excerpt (the prelude) from the TV show ""Classic Arts Showcase"", I was touched by the sounds of the orchestra, the childrens' choir, the ancient bells, and the cello played by Yo-yo Ma. I decided to buy this CD, and this was a lucky choice. The whole music was understandable: mysterious, melancholy, and glorious. I have no disagreement about the composer Tan Dun borrwing some composers' music, especially Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"". But perhpaps this was Tan's best choice. Besides, ""Ode to Joy"" means something like happiness. And Tan Dun's 1997 Symphony has a similar theme, about peace.This may be the only Tan Dun music I may listen, but this CD is perfect for my CD collection. I thank all the staffs, the performers, and the singers for making this music really wonderful. And I especially thank the composer Tan Dun. Shei shei!"
4,A splendid edition,"This is one of my favorite zola books. Apparently a bit autobiographical, Claude's Confession chronicles Zola's time as a student in Paris, and follows him and his friends to sordid parties, deep conversations in the country, and continues into their careers and deaths. A bit long winded at times but no less a great book. Highly recommended (and this version has a nice contemporary translation)."
3,Not guitar tab,"The book is fine, but many of the reviews on this site refer to guitar tab. There is no tab in this book. Look closely at the cover. It says piano/vocal. It is strictly piano/vocal performance. Despite the reviews, if you are looking for tab, this book is not for you."
3,Real period piece--grunge-era,"I had the pleasure of knowing and hearing Jesse read poetry in Seattle the days he was reading poetry and alive. This is a great example of a Seattle poet of that time incorporating grunge into the written word. He was probably the first poet in that area to do this, so it put him on the map, as did his outlandish lifestyle and character! He was a sweetie--I particularly liked what he ventured into--the piano/poetry performances he began giving after that. Too bad there isn't more of that professionally recorded."
3,About the album,I am a big fan of Steven. The background music kills the cd.I cant picture it being much better if they used the Johnny Cash folsom prison music. I would have enjoyed it much more if it was just spoken word. Thats just me though. Listen to the samples.
1,The noise competes with the poetry,"Some poetry is born to be also music (e.g., Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen). Some other poetry is born to be read as poetry and the addition of music is only the addition of masking noise. I had the hope of hearing poetry; instead, I got some horrible noise that at times made the words unintelligible. What a waste of poetry! I wish somebody could publish Bernstein's poetry readings free of noise."
3,College Book,"Seems like a very good book, for small schools. Unfortunately, it seems like they are usually pretty expensive. My daughter will explore the content, however."
1,misleading title. very little on PLAYING the piano.,there is very little about PLAYING the pianolots of tangential material but if you want to play you need some other bookjust got a general interest in the piano then this covers the waterfront plus the whole town toowant music theory - read teh idiots/dummies theory book which is far better than what is herewant to actually PLAY the piano then get one of the many books/dvds tht focus on playing not everythign elsethis book is very broad hence so thin it is not worth looking at if yo uwant to actually PLAY the piano
3,"it's okay, but where are the smashing pumpkins?","I'm not sure why the Pumpkins were left off of this, but the cd is decent."
5,You'll ride this story to the end fast,"Even if you're not interested in English nobility, golf, horses or art, you won't put this book down. Dick Francis just knows how to keep a reader galloping through the pages."
4,Not All Aristocrats Are Snobs.,"Alexander Kinloch is the twenty-nine-year old son of the deceased fourth son of an earl. He lives alone in a hut on a windy mountainside in Scotland spending his time painting and playing the bagpipes. Alexander receives word from his mother in London that his stepfather is dying. His stepfather is Ivan George Westering, who owns a brewery and is a pillar of the British Jockey Club. Before leaving to see Ivan and his mother, Alexander is beaten by four thugs who ransack his hut. In London he learns that there is a discrepancy in the accounts of Ivan's brewery and a large sum of money is missing. Francis has created another likeable protagonist in Alexander Kinloch and a memorable supporting cast of helpers and villains. Horses are only a peripheral issue in this book which is the author's thirty-fifth novel. Some interesting touches of medieval history add spice to a fast-paced story."
5,The Butterfly,"Having worked on Wall Street from 88-02 alongside quants, forex, equities, program traders, etc - I felt a kindred spirit for the collection of characters in this book. An eclectic mix of brilliant minds thrown together in stressful situatations leads to entertainment no matter how you slice it. The butterfly effect is something that is discussed occasionally over drinks, but never taken to heart like it was in this book. How one wrong trade, misheard over a rant about commuting, could bring down countries and potentially collapse the financial markets is worth contemplating.... at least until the market opens. I'd recommend this book for a fun weekend read."
3,A useful intro to vegan cajun cuisine,This book gave me some idea of how to serve up food with Cajun flavors but minus the meat and dairy. This book could have been jazzed up a little more though.
1,very inaccurate,If the rest of this book is anything like the Four Freshmen biography it's not worth buying.It's pretty clear the author knows nothing about the Four Freshmen and has never been to Freshmen concert or he would know that they are still one of the most respected jazz groups of any era. Anyone who wants an accurate description of the Four Freshmen or any of the other vocal groups from 1940 thru 1990 may i suggest you buy Jay Warner's book titled The Billboard of American Singing Groups.Thank you. Keith A. Smith.
1,The Depths of Artistry,It is hard to imagine anything more precious and cloying than this collection of popular songs sung by a person whose interpretations so infect her vocal techniques as to come out totally laughable. One could use this as a party record except that after a few songs one has to stop listening out of boredom and anger....
1,Que lastima,bueno lo único que puedo decir es que héroes del silencio rock's pero el que edito el dvd no tenia ni idea de lo que estaba haciendo... de verdad que lastima que este video en calidad no le llegue ni a los tobillos a héroes del silencio.
3,Buen concierto - Mala grabación,"Que lástima que se haya desperdiciado esta oportunidad para producir un DVD con buena imagen y calidad de sonido; la imagen es incluso peor que la del concierto de reencuentro de Soda Stereo. Si eres un fan de corazón puedes comprarlo porque la ejecución fue buena, pero te quedas con ganas de tener un buen registro de esta banda en vivo."
2,Not the kind of DVD Heroes del Silencio deserves,"The concert by itself reframes the greatness of Heroes del Silencio.The biggest turn-off is the video quality ... First, at the beggining and in some parts, the audio doesn't match the video. And last, it looks blurry compared to other great bands DVD's.It's a shame that the producers released this awful quality DVD. I repeat, is not the kind of DVD Heroes del Silencio deserves."
4,Really nice!,"Arrived quickly. Simple to assemble. We're using it hold a 48"" target... makes it very easy for my 13 yr old to set it up for use and then put it away in the storage shed when done!"
5,Romance can be such fun!,"I enjoyed Isn't it Romantic? a lot.First of all, I liked the cover. OK, I know we shouldn't judge books by covers, but this one is tops, and reflects the book's personality perfectly. Katrine and Trey - one romance writer, one journo who hates romance. A meeting made in hell - or rather, cooked up by their respective editors! I won't give away the plot, but I will say it plays back and forth like a tennis match, tit for tat, as two strong characters fight it out in the arena. OK, they're fighting one another, but they're also up against themselves and their own pasts. Sounds like weighty stuff, but it's fun, fun, fun all the way. Washday will never be the same and the concept of s*fe s*x is presented in - shall we say - a highly memorable fashion?I'm smiling as I write, and I'd happily recommend this one to any readers with a taste for a dash of fun to spice up their romances."
2,monotonous & sterile,"Technically accurate, I suppose, but lacking emotion and expression. I feel the performer is attempting a new land-speed record. For comparision, ""Pour les Arpeges Composes"" is also on ""Debussy Dreams"" performed by Aldo Ciccolini (EMI Classics). Ciccolini's performance is truly enjoyable, while Uchida's is uninteresting.I am unable to let this CD play all the way through - it actually becomes irritating. A surprising result for the works of Debussy."
2,Whirlwind performance but lacking poetry,From the start the playing was incisive but I soon longed for something that brought me France rather than a robot. I've heard MU's Beethoven and been utterly astonished - but these intriguing Etudes (often for me as moody and interesting as the Preludes if not more so) seem hammered out and drained of their inner secrets. Disappointing.
