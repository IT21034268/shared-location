2,Great for the beach or wide open space NOT for your backyard,These look like they are fairly well designed and they haven't broken by any means but they are just too fast to play with. I tried them a couple of times and with barely a touch they zoom nearly over the fence. These would be awesome at the beach or in a wide open space but if you're thinking of getting them for your backyard or for a smaller area I would say hold off because you'll just end up losing them.
4,Tweeter and the Baby Boomers,"For an assemblage of big-name stars, the Traveling Wilburys is about as good as it gets. Lynne, Dylan, Harrison, Orbison, and Petty team up and perform together just as well as they do when on their own with their own bands. Usually super groups come across as contrived and shoe-horned to fit a market niche, but these guys combine in a way that, had Roy Orbison lived another 5 years or more, they might have achieved enough fame as a group to rival the fame they achieved on their own, or, in Harrison's case, as a lesser member of the Beatles. Who knows? The only drawback I can find is that their musical style is a bit dated, so maybe today's listeners won't be very impressed, but for nostalgic ""boomers"" on a fixed income you can't beat the 2 CD/1 DVD set that's being offered for sale. Highly recommended."
5,Traveling Wilburys,"Good price, good product, good price, good service. No complaints.Traveling Wilburys (2 CD / 1 DVD)"
5,Great issue except,"This cd collection was worth waiting for except they should have put the demos from both cds on a seperate disk.where was dylans solo of ""Shes my baby and rest of the unreleased demos?"" And ""like a ship"" and ""maxine"" should have been on volume 3 where they belong. This supergroup truly was a supergroup."
5,Own this now and for all time,"This is the Haley's comet of musical collaborations. Never again in our lifetime will such a cosmic convergence grace us - truly a gift for the ages. The DVD, although far too short, is worth every penny, granting us glimpses of greatness, just being themselves, simply good friends who love music (and yes who just happen to be some of the most influential musicians of the past 40 years.)"
2,Long live Roy!,"I really enjoyed the 2 or so hits on this collection. The rest are pretty hard to listen to. After Roy died, so did the band. Better off getting the debut CD and forgetting the rest."
3,My cd,"I bought this CD for my mom for Christmas becuase she had been looking for this CD for, like, 10 years (and doesn't know how to shop on the Internet), and when she went to go put in the second CD it snapped as soon as she laid a finger on it...."
3,REd Dirt Girl,"I can still remember the first time that I heard Emmylou Harris on the radio. Although this would be a good CD for any other artist, it is simply average for her. She took country music back to its roots AND explored new territory all at the same time. Emmylou is best in a spare acoustic arrangement or a very traditional country arrangement. Her exploration of alternative music (but the phrasing and themes are still very much country) makes her seem insipid, very much like an alternative Shania Twain or Faith Hill. I can't believe that the vapidness of contemporary Nashville and country music radio causes her to go in this direction. ... ."
1,Is This For Real??,This has to be the worst album I ever listened to. At first I thought our stereo system was broken. It sounds muddy and muffled and there is no engineering/production quality.I love Emmylou and own almost all her vinyl & cd's but this album does not make it. I wish I listened to it before I purchased it.
2,Drum programming run amuck.....,"While appreciating the heartfelt lyrics, the muddy production, lack of melody, (except on the occasional bridge), and lack of diction (more slurring than a drunken sailor) detract from the whole. It sure SOUNDS like it was recorded in someone's living room....."
5,This is Emmylou,"Beautiful, poetic, honest, deep. Not at all ponderous. Not at all muddy. The soundtrack to dreams. I hope sharing so much pain and longing has helped ease it, as hearing her sing of it brings such release. This is the pearl. Allelujah."
3,"Awful sound, wonderful songs","These are wonderful, insightful songs that deserve much more than the fifth-rate cassette-recorder sound they get on this recording. I've heard better bootlegs. The voices are disembodied, constricted, and downright painful to listen to on a good system. I dislike, but understand the dark mood the accompaniments are supposed to provide. Like them or not, they sound like a spliced-in afterthought. The New Orleans studio that recorded this should be ashamed of itself, and I would like to think that Ms. Harris didn't listen to it before it was released. These songs deserve re-release in a different form. Hopefully the master tapes are better than the final mix, and one of the audiophile labels will be able to do something better with them one day, hopefully soon."
3,The horrible recording quality really grates on me :(,"Let me say, first off, that I am NOT one of those anally-retentive, fussy, audiophile types, but when I first put this CD on, I was like ""Whoa, WTF is wrong with my stereo?"" and then I realised that this album is just recorded like that. The music I love, but the recording is so horrible it just jumps out and throttles you."
5,Works just fine and fits properly,This blade works like advertised and makes a nice milkshake. It also fits our older blender with no problems at all.
2,Waste of money.,"Don't buy this thinking you can use it to make health smoothies. It may be great for ice cream drinks, but no way it is adequate with frozen fruit, ice cubes, etc. it fit my Oster, but until I start drinking 600 calorie ice cream drinks, it will stay in its cute little box in the junk drawer."
1,waste of money,"This blade may be fine for making milk shakes with ice cream and fruit, but if you plan to make protein shakes with ice cubes tossed in, use the original blade for this blender. This Milkshake Blade just won't do the job, and you'll have chunks of ice floating in your shake. I made a shake using milk (Silk, actually), soft banana, protein powder, and small ice cubes and this blade couldn't handle the job. Disappointing."
4,Does it's thing,Not sure what I expected but it doesn't seem that much better than the ice crusher blade I was using. Maybe it's the materials I am using. I don't use ice so that may make them more equal. It does seem like smoothies could be a little smoother. I certainly am not disappointed. would be nice if these came with a new o-ring.
2,"Good for liquids, not so much for a mix with solids","My normal breakfast is a fruit smoothie. Sometimes, the blender would take a long time getting trough the frozen fruit. I thought that this could be an improvement. Not really. It is great for mixing liquids. My wife uses it when preparing soup bases, it is just OK for making smoothies with fresh fruit. The mixing occurs at about the sme rate as with the original blade, but there are still small fruit chunks in the solution after blending. With frozen fruit, don't bother, It is much slower than the original blade and the mixing is far from complete."
2,"maybe, if you like your shake chunky","Maybe it depends what you put in your smoothie/milkshake.On the plus side, this blade does get things moving, so I never need to stop and manually unclog a jam with a spoon.On the minus side, no matter how long I run the blender, this blade chops the leafy greens for my green smoothie into bite-sized chunks, so that I end up having to ""eat"" rather than drink the final product. (The original ""ice crusher"" blade got the same ingredients almost, but not quite, smooth. MUCH smoother than this blade does.)Save your money. I wish I had."
1,Doesn't work with Oster glass blender,This product does not fit the Oster glass blender with its standard parts. I was unable to screw the black retainer on with this component. All other parts work fine (so it's this part that is the issue).
2,Not anything special,"I used this blender blade to make 2 milkshakes, and then the normal blade for the rest thereafter, because this blade seemed to me to be inferior to the standard blender blade for its said purpose: milkshakes. That said, it wasn't terrible, it did indeed mix milk and ice cream together in the end, but it just took longer because the fan shape of the blade kept the icecream from reaching the bottom of the blender."
2,Can't find any heads,"It's a very nice tool. It works good, except for for one big problem. I can not find the different heads anywhere, and thats the main reason why I bought it so I could have the different heads, but apparently they stoped making them. Also you can NOT fold it up which sucks. I was very dissapointed after buying it and seeing it don't fold and I can not buy the heads any where since they don't make them any more."
5,No City Like New Orleans,"What a wonderful series!There is no city like New Orleans, and whether you didn't get there before Katrina or you knew it well, go again - it's still amazing, heartening, and very sexy. This series shows it all, and the people are depicted very realistically. The music is fab, the acting amazing - if you're a New Yorker or from a big urban place, you owe it to yourself to experience this series, if you can't get to the place. Open yourself for quite an eye-opening, soul-filled experience.Then you'll ""know what it means to miss New Orleans"" as I do!"
2,You want to Love It but.......,"Yes its New Orleans home of some of the best in roots popular music,yes its the Wire team; yes its got good actors but.... It doesn't work. Too stiff, too ponderouse, too in part badly acted. It makes for a very slow and yes, it grieves me to say it; boring view. John Goodman, one of the comedy greats is particularly poorly served. He is no seriouse actor and the pontificating he is given in the script means his on screen death can not come too soon.(Sorry John I will always treasure you for the Big Lebowski).Steve Zahn acts out some characture of a bohemian hippy which wouldn't convince a child.The black section of the cast are far superior,particularly the great Wendell Pierce. His performance is worth catching. Other wise keep your money in your pocket. Sorry."
3,Okay but that is all,"I watched this at the suggestion of a friend since I am planning to visit New Orleans in a couple of months. It was okay but I did not really understand what was going on and do not particularly like this style of music. So, I will not be buying the rest of the series as I didn't like it that much."
5,Best thing going....,"Treme (Season 1) was the best thing on TV while it was in season. I was glued to the TV every Sunday night.... ready to catch the next episode.Top to bottom, front to back, a great job on making a TV masterpiece. How this series garnered ZERO emmy nominations is absolutely beyond me. Those that are responsible for the lack of recognition should be moved as far away from the emmy ballot box as possible.But those are just phony, popularity contest awards anyways. What counts is that this is one helluva show. Those that weren't lucky enough to catch it on HBO should buy this immediately.Can't wait for Season 2!!!!"
5,Treme season 1,"This series is outstanding. I'm currently watching season 2, and it just gets better and better. The first season shows how residents of NOLA struggle with the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. The culture of the city is shown in all its glory--the food, parades, indians, and the music, which is outstanding. I don't usually purchase tv series, but I am voraciously acquiring every season of Treme."
1,"In the Words of Sir J: Oh, Horror!","What a total embarrassment to the ""institution"" of the Guthrie Theatre. Didn't the Managing Director of the Company watch any of the rehearsals. The only way I can describe this ""happening"" is to say that one is drawn in to it because it is so terrible. You can't believe what is happening before your eyes. Walk away for twenty minutes and come back to it. It's even worse than before.Having worked with The New Savoy Opera Company in Portland, OR and The Lamplighters in San Francisco, CA, I can honestly say that this in NOT Gilbert and Sullivan.I don't know what it is; p'haps something Doctor Who brought back from an alternate universe"
4,works great minus water tightness,"The product works great. However, be careful in filling it up and putting into your pack. It's likely to leak out. I keep mine empty most times, and fill up in a cool mountain creek when I find one. After that, I store the bottle upright in an outside pocket in my pack. I typically don't have any problems and it keeps me cool for hours. I'm surprised how well this little simple thing works!"
1,ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!An AWFUL singer (or singers??) trying to make money singing Josh Groban's songs! I wanted to give this ZERO stars, but that was not an option.DO NOT buy this CD---it is a TOTAL RIP-OFF, and sounds TERRIBLE. Go buy the REAL Josh Groban CD's!!"
1,WTF?,"The only ""tribute"" worthy of this CD is to destroy all copies of this Milli-Vanilli version of the multitalented man Groban is. The cover adds insult to injury. What's next? Country or rap ""tributes""? Elevator music would be better received. As long as we have the original, let's celebrate that voice and musical genius. So, I repeat ... WTF?"
1,What the @#$%?,"Why would anyone replace crystal clear diamond perfection with a cheap chunk of plastic? WHY???? DO NOT bother with this one. The samples alone churned my stomach. Josh Groban could never be imitated. His voice is truly a gift from heaven. No one could ever do his songs like him, since he is the best there is. And by the way, is he even 25 yet? Uh, why the tribute? He has a lifetime of music yet to record and I look forward to every decade of it."
1,What were they thinking....,I am a fan of Josh and have seen him in concert and I have to tell you those sound bytes are laughable. At first I though it had to be a karaoke cd?!?!? What a waste of time and money....
1,"No, no, no.","This is a horrid reproduction. Do not buy this album. Consider purchasing ""Josh Groban: Live at the Greek"". Its worth every penny and there's nothing generic about it.This music is like leaving an apple in the refrigerator to fermint and then trying to eat it and expecting it to taste the way it would have when you bought if from the market."
1,What the heck was that...?,"This thing isn't anything but FUNNY!Haha, they really think someone would actually buy it? Crazy people.One of them even sounded like a Westlife guy.Hey guys, don't buy it. If you do (for some mysterious reason) want to buy it, at least listen to the samples and laugh your head off before you do."
1,a travesty,"who in their right mind would even buy this piece of garbage? there is only one josh groban and he has the voice of an angel. so why buy this stuff when you can buy the real thing and hear his beautiful voice. dont waste your money of this, buy only the authentic josh groban cd's."
1,EEEEEKKK!!!,"Not to be mean, but this is guy sings terrible! I don't know if he did it to impress Josh, but, honestly, I would be offended. Please do not buy this album."
1,That was just scary!,I listened to two of the tracks and that's all I could take. I agree why would you spend money on this when you could listen to the real Josh! There's no substitute AND what's up with the CD cover. They cut off his head! This is just awful. Really I wouldn't even give it 1 star!
1,This makes me so sad...,"To think that someone would release this CD is astonishing to me( and not in a good way) not only can the ""singers"" not sing, but the fact that is titled ""TRIBUTE"" makes me want to vomit. Josh Groban is very talented and the way this CD seems to make fun of it...really really annoys me. I would just say... DON""T BUY this CD. I really think its a rip off.. meant to try and get some money from unsuspecting fans of Josh Groban. Don't fall for it. Turn back now... just listen to My Confession...you'll hear the disgrace to Josh's name. It's horrifying."
2,Ha Ha!,"Well, that guy doesn't have a horrible voice. It's not entirely unpleasant...But he's not Josh Groban. Leave it to the pro's mate."
2,Very Funny Spoof,"Yes, I consider this a ""Spoof"" of Josh Groban's work. To correct one reviewer, JOSH GROBAN DIDN'T WRITE ALL OF HIS WORK! He actually wrote only a few of the songs he ever sang. This is funny, but worse than that is Josh Groban's newest Concert, Live at the Greek, which is way overpriced. It's a mediocre at best. Some say THIS is not Josh. Well Josh isn't Josh on his own stage. At least the Josh Groban who rose to rapid world-wide fame. Who cares?? Do you really think anyone will buy this tripe. Get a sense of humor!!"
1,What in the world is this mess???,This CD is horrible. These people really can not sing it is just an insult to Josh Groban not a tribute. They took all my fave songs and just destroyed them horribly. If you want something good get the actual Josh Groban CD.
1,"This is Josh's evil twin, right?","This CD is so bad, my dog rolled over and played dead and then stopped as soon as the sample was over. Who in their right mind would allow this CD to even be made? Or better yet, who was the sound man who was recording this? By far the worse track, like they're not all bad, is ""Si Volvieras A Mi"". If you couldn't speak the language well, why sing in it? If I had my way I would have asked for a star to be given to me as an accident for finding this CD."
1,Please take this off the shelf,I think Josh Groban deserves and could get a better tribute then this.I listend to the reviews and found them horrible and distasteful.I am a huge fan of Josh Groban and I mean no offense in this but I think he would not enjoy this. To anyone who plans on purchasing this cd I would sample it first.
1,Awful,"I wasn't even thinking of buying this but I wanted to hear it. I gritted my teeth through 30 excruciating seconds of these horrible tracks. ""Si Volvieras A Mi"" was just pathetic. You can tell that the guy has never spoken Spanish before in his life. Not to mention being completely tone deaf. This is the kind of singing that would make dogs howl.I also think it's really cheap to put someone on the front of the album trying to look like Josh. I hope many people haven't been duped into buying this.Don't bother buying this trash, go buy the real thing."
1,Do I even have to give it ONE star?!,"This is the most pathetic thing I have ever heard! In fact, it's hilarious. Honestly, do these ""artists"" think they actually sound like or better than Josh Groban?! Don't buy this, whatever you do! It's awful. It's embarrassing and unbelievably horrible!"
1,OUCH!,That is just horrible. It was like listening to bad karaoke. I am an ardent Josh Groban fan and I am with the first reviewer. Do yourself a favour and buy a Josh Groban CD. You will never regret it.
1,LMAO,"I am still laughing. I just listened to the ""clips"". I am also thanking God that the clips were short. Who are these Karaoke performers (and bad ones at that)? I want to know what they did with the money their mothers gave them for singing lessons. I am sure that after this abyssmal attempt at singing, they will learn to perfect the phrase ""Do you want fries with that"".Bodily functions sound better. This has got to be a joke."
1,Yuck,It isn't the songs--it's the VOICE. There's only one Josh Groban. Why on earth would anyone buy this CD of shoddy remakes when you can have the real thing? This review is based just on the samples (which made my stomach turn because they were so bad.)
1,Why?,"Why take the most amazing song sung by the most amazing voice and remake them by people who do not have nearly the talent of Josh Groban???? I agree with the other reviewer, Yuck!"
1,""" A Tribute to Josh Groban, vol. 2"" by William Hung?!?!","This must be one of the WORST CD's that has ever been made. Even listening to the sample clips was a torture. The only way this CD could have been any worse is if William Hung of American Idol sang the songs. Oh, no!!! I hope I didn't just give the producers any ideas!!! ""A Tribute to Josh Groban, vol. 2"" by William Hung?!?! **Shrieking and pulling hair out...**"
2,disappointed compared to previous years,"previous year's nom CD covered Best Female Artist Pop and Male pretty extensively. This year they've missed some great performances from Dido's White Flag, Sarah McLachlan's Fallen, and Kelly Clarkson's Miss Independent. And why didn't they give us Evanescence's Bring Me to Life? Or Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now?"
5,Memorable,Small Apartments was so well written that images of the story stay with you for years! It's a book you can read again and again!
4,Great first cook book for young male professional,I discovered I can cook and enjoy it. I've never cooked so much in the past few weeks than in any time in my life. I tried a couple different cook books before this but I liked this one way better. Most cook books require way too much time and too many ingredients. I like this because it is much more simple and less time consuming.
3,"Lots of fat, little meat","At its core, Wonder Weeks has useful information. Unfortunately, the reader has to wade through a lot of pointless and redundant reading to get to it. It could probably be 30-40 pages and convey the stuff you actually want to get from it.To save readers a lot of time, here's a tip - the first 20ish pages of each chapter can be summed up as ""Your baby is entering a growth spurt. He or she will be cranky and clingy. You will be tired and frustrated."" That's 50% of the book. Another 25% are testimonials from moms reinforcing those three sentences. The rest is the actual meat - how you can help your baby through this particular spurt, and how the spurt is changing your baby's brain and skill set.My other complaint is that dads don't exist in this book. We're apparently absent from the parenting process. These days, that has to have been a conscious decision on the author's part, and I just don't get it."
1,Developmental Milestones seem off-base,"I've read a lot on developmental milestones and this book is off-base as far as I can tell. Maybe if your baby is a genius... or perhaps they're just a whole lot smarter over there in Europe!! Also chock-full of useless page-filler anecdotes by ""frustrated"" parents. Save the $20 and peep the book's message right here: don't get all mad when your kids get fussy -- they're just working through some stuff and everything'll be fine. Fin."
2,The time frames seem off,"I have read many of the more highly recommended baby book (Baby 411, What to Expect..., the AAP guide, Healthy Sleep habits, etc.), and we bought this book because my wife heard the authors give a talk. I have gotten quite frustrated reading the book because it seems that my 4.5 month son is only mapping to about 25% of the authors' stated developmental milestones. Yet in the aforementioned books, he's tracking between 50 and 75% to the stated milestones. Maybe babies in the Netherlands are just a lot more advanced than ours - but their developmental milestone calibration seems to be way off."
1,A poor version of such an excellent book,"Lutz's ""Animated cartoons"" is well written manual of making animation cartoons in 1920's. The description of techniques is simple and understandable, and you can learn what Disney and his rivals derived from this wonderful resource. It also provides a good review of the animation history in early years.This excellent book, however, has such a poor version from General Books LLC. The version seems to be the only OCR data, including many errors without any layout, and almost impossible to read. If you don't want to waste your money, choose the hard cover version, or try to find a copy-free version online."
5,Guerrilla is a must read,"This is a well organized ""how to"" book with manyvery useful instructions, warnings and tips. A very valuable read when preparing for a conference or trade show. I was never bored. Sections are clearly labeled so I was able to skip over pages of information which did not apply to my interest. Of six books I skimmed on trade shows, this was the best."
2,this game is not fun at all!!,When i first got the game it seemed like it would be alot of fun. but then when i tryed it out it just told you how to ride a horse. i got this game for fun not to hear how to ride. and the horses look weird. nuthing like horses at all. the jumping for compatation is sorta fun. but the drassage is sooo hard. you have to memorize this really hard rutine. exept for the compation its not good at all.
2,OK game......played better,I have this game and to tell you the truth I played it for an extermely long time like 2 or more hours for about a 1 week and a half.Then I got burnt out on it.If you do buy this game play it for like 30 min. a day or it will get boring.The only exciting part is the show.I reccomend show-jumping on the game...I have done that so much (especially course 1) that even that is getting boring.
4,LET'S RIDE,Good game for horse lovers. Very good at teaching dressage.Let's Ride 2 is out now and is wayyyyy better then this one.It has 3 different games to play and they are all greatttt!!Willowbrook stables is AWESOME!! it's a must for horse lovers!!
4,Decent book on the building of the ship,"For once, a book that doesn't bore us with chapter after chapter about the events of April 14th, but rather concentrates on the ship itself. While some areas could have been done in more detail, I was extremely pleased with the quality to price ratio."
2,boring,"This seems to be a spectaculair soundtrack to the populair third movie in the 'pirates' series. It is not. You love this music or you hate it. I don't like it much. It's very predictable, lot of rythems with orchestra and synths. It's Zimmer at random. Some nice moments, but overall, don't bother listen to it if you already have part one or two. In my opinion, Zimmer writes nice melodies, but it's not filmmusic as it should be. You better check out 'Cutthroat Island' by John Debney. 'At worlds end' is a poor attempt to mix modern filmmusic with an old fashion 'swashbuckling' sound. It's time Zimmer gets his retirement."
2,Be forewarned!,"I was very disapointed when I received my CD from Amazon and saw that it's not even in a jewel case. It is packaged in a cheap, flimsy cardboard case. I would buy it somewhere else!"
5,This soundtrack Is very good and Is very Rrich and Dynamic,I like this soundtrack. I just enjoy listening to it repeatedly. The early sections of this soundtrack are eerie and have a great mystical quality about them reaching out from the mysterious Far East. It is very good. I still wonder how much involvement Hans Zimmer had with this recording. I love the final cut which comes full circle with the Jack Sparrow theme.
5,The Ultimate Climax,"The music from this, the third in the ""Pirates"" series, continues themes from the earlier movies and adds newer content that somehow flows perfectly into the total. As before, the underlying feeling of the sea is in the score, but this time the ""love theme"" reflects the changes that the characters make. The entire sound track echoes the threads in the story, yet still holds on to the swashbuckling nature of the movie."
2,FM Antenna,"I bought this FM antenna for my office radio to improve reception...no real help from it though mainly due to our building & the distance away from any radio stations I had wanted to listen to on the radio. I would have returned it but had already thrown away the box for recycling. When I gave feedback to Terk on Amazon, Amber from Terk immediately phoned us to resolve the matter. Great customer service on their part. We just kept the antenna though as we didn't have the box & maybe we'll use it at home."
2,Buyer Beware,"First the positives... This dog house looks good, is easy to assemble, and it's lightweight enough that you can pick it up and move it around as needed after assembly. BUT, if your dog is prone to chewing, as my 7 month old lab was, this will be a waste of your precious money! I read reviews that said dogs shy away from chewing this type of wood, but my dog not only chewed it, he swallowed much of it as he chewed. It isn't a hard wood and isn't much of a deterrent."
5,easy to put together and also has insulation kit and door to fit,"I was having prob getting strays to go in lg dog house I had gotten..didnt like each other i guess..so I bought this one in a small..Its roomy enough for a few cats (that like each other) and I put in mats, etc but it was so cold an rainy..and they were outside. I realized the dog house keeps them dry but not warm so then I bought the insulation kit made for this house. The house and the kit were easy to assemble (HInt: if u want the door..or may want the door..get it before installing insulation or u have to take off roof, out insul., etc to put on door). I later got a different brand house for a change and found that some are nightmares to put together and of poor material and workmanship so have to putty them, etc. so for ease and your pets comfort this doghouse is number one. Once the insulation was in..kitty was too."
4,Easy travel,"Friends always get a laugh knowing that we're taking these for travel. The underwear isn't too attractive, but not uncomfortable and so easy to use and dispose. Ordered the same a year or two ago, but this batch seemed to run a size smaller and had to send back to get the larger size."
5,"Timex Gold-color, Men's Watch","A reasonably priced, easy-to-read watch, with all 12 hours' listed dial, with gold-color case and stretch band. I've dropped it from arm-height, without it affecting its operation and display of the correcttime. I give it a top-rating."
3,Good staff,"I think ""Sony DCR-VX2000 Digital Camcorder"" is a good camcoder. I like at most the feature 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio common to make movies."
5,Must Read,"Hilarious. Memorable characters, makes you look forward to reading the next book in the series to see what funny thing happens next. Tante Lulu is my favorite character of all time."
3,Magnifyong lamp is a must-have for sewing projects!,"This lamp was purchased to replace a previous fixture exactly like it. I anxiously awaited its arrival so I could get back to my sewing. I was disappointed when my package arrived to find that black ""shade"" around the magnifying lap was severely broken on the most protruding part. The packaging was inadequate. It was placed in a box with a thin plastic bag around it, no packing material at all. It would have been quite simple to avert this situation with propere packaging.I used super glue to put re-attach the large pieces. Then, my hot glue gun filled in the gaps where the tiny shards were missing. I am happily using my lamp with great satisfaction. It's a great product."
2,Great sound if you can keep the speakers charged,"Griffin must know they have a problem with battery life. Like most other dissatisfied reviewers, I lost the ability to keep the batteries charged shortly after a year. Seems like the units should maintain their charging ability longer than that for the price paid. They are willing to replace a speaker for $50 per unit. Doesn't seem worth the money when I suspect I will only get another year's use. While the sound quality is excellent, I wouldn't buy this product if you intend to use frequently for extended periods. They have no remorse over the problem."
2,Not that great!,"At first this seemed like the perfect system. However, after a few months the docking mechanism for the iPod shorted out. I have other iPod docks and those work fine with my iPod so I know it is the system and not my iPod. I am very disappointed with the quality of this item! I will not buy a griffin again."
4,Good,Variety gave us a good idea of which flavors we like. The brand is a good one and we have a Bradley smoker so we needed the bisquettes. The other flavor we like is Jim Beam.
4,Way To Go Ann!,I hav read this book that is why Iam reviewing it. The decision Claudia will make is a really big decision because once she decides about one thing her life will change find out what Imean by reading this book.
5,A Great book,"has so much usefull info in it, source code on a disk, what more do you need. Lots of handy curcuits."
1,Riiiiiiiiight.......,"Ok, first of all, Paul Bergsman taught math at my high school (La Salle)and, he was a horrible teacher, fired within the first 6 months he was there. I had no idea he actually wrote a book, though, so I checked it out... HA! what a bunch of bologna! He has no idea what he's talking about- at least it doesn't seem so to the reader. His descriptions are so cryptic and overwhelming. It's just so horribly written... and I could swear he's trying to get the reader to make a bomb or somethin... apparently he carried around school a bomb and a clock that he made himself...ok now that's just wierd... However, you can look for his book if you want but he is an oddball and no one understands him. HA! Bologna!"
5,Tony Bennett's Duets II,"It's one of the best. I play this CD in my car, and several people who have listened to the music loved it. I bought extras for Christmas presents!"
4,Tony still gettin it done,Sometimes duet albums seem to happen too late in a career. Not so with Mr Bennett. He`s still an amazing vocalist and lots of the partners he chose to duet with make this a worthy album to own IMO.Well done Tony !!
4,Duets2,Nice CD. I Bought the CD for someone else. There are lots of great singer and song on this CD
2,way less than expected,"Tony Bennett remains the best male singer ever and a consummate entertainer as well. I listened to the CD once and am almost ashamed to use it as a coaster. While everyone involved surely enjoyed the project and all are terrific solo artist, with few exceptions this is a tough one to get through. When it ended I listened to the Tony Bennett/Bill Evans recordings, something every Tony Bennett fan should have in their collection. Duets 1 is a better option."
5,Great work!,I did not know so much about Tony Bennett before I bought this CD and I think it's wonderful. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys classical or jazz music with a touch of youth.
2,One for the easy listening fans - disapointing for the jazz lover,"I am a big fan of Tony Bennett so it is with some sadness that I give this two stars only. If you are an easy listening fan you may find something of interest here. For those of us coming from the Jazz side this is a very disappointing album, no improvisation, little spontaneity and overproduced numbers complete with orchestra and syrupy violins. Duets 1 was borderline in this respect but Duets 2 is simply boring. Lady Gaga and Willy Nelson contribute some cute numbers but on the whole one to avoid. Also the record is badly mastered with poor dynamic range. I have a longer review of this on my blog - the link is in my profile."
5,All that and then some!,This is truly a work of art. The incredible talent of Tony Bennett collaborated with the voices of many other also talented singers is amazing! I've never purchased anything by Tony until I heard this CD. Thank you for this wonderful music in an era where the lyrics are sung so fast that I have no idea what was just said.
4,Love It!,"This is my new favorite CD. It's perfect to listen to anytime, especially in traffic. A great ""feel good"" CD. I love it!"
5,All cuts great.,I loved the whole CD. I'm really not a fan of Lady Gaga but her duet with TB was excellent; along with all the other cuts.
3,Not spectacular,"The cd seems to lack the degree of professional quality, meaning songs and arrangements, that I expected. Aretha Franklin sounds like a screeching alley cat."
5,Duets II,"Tony is like Sinatra, a living legend. Enjoyed this CD. Saw him many, many years ago at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, CA. All that was missing on the CD is a picture of him in his red satined lined tux."
3,kbrads,"I don't feel it is as good as his first one. I still like his voice, but some of the people he does duets with actually ruin the song for me."
4,Duets II,"Tony Bennett sings so very good as usual. He is 85, and still a great voice. His duets are done very well and incorporate the best of his and his partners ability and personality in each song. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes good music."
3,SILVERTIP,"It was an easy read. Just an OK story, but written well.would recommend for quick reading. I prefer more romance."
4,This game is going to rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game looks awesome so far. You get to play out the Original trilogy. The characters move like real people do.The action is fast, not slow like the past SW GBA games.If anything, I am so looking forward to the lightsabre battles, especially the Boba Fett battle at the Sarlacc Pit.I'm so getting this when it comes out!For inrfo on the game, go to www.ignpocket.com.Believe me, this game will rock!"
5,excellant,I had bought this handycam on my daughter's birthday.I am very happy with performance especially with digital effects and supreb zooming technology.
1,Let's see a real review....,"I was about to order this book based on the reviews, when I changed my mind. Upon rereading them, I believe that the reviews so far are most likely bogus. The first one is identical to one on the site but with a different name, and two others appear to be by the same individual a month apart. The reviews do not go into any depth, though most reviews on Amazon.com tend to provide details regarding the books they write about. I'll wait to buy the book until I read some real reviews...."
4,not the old fashioned way i expected,"not the best cd this year. but also noy the worst, i expected better from snoop. please call dre, or holla at ant banks, crazy toons, or quik. but worth a listen if you love snoop,or west coast rap."
5,Waiting for warm weather!,Ordered this for my Chinese exchange student as she misses playing badminton. She can't wait for the frigid temperatures to move out so we can try it out. Arrived exactly as described. Appears to be good quality.
2,Did not see much difference.,I expected much more from this product. Did not fly as fast and as far as the other reviews led me to believe.
3,Okay buy.,"This product was an okay buy, but it does scratch up very easy and is hard to see the screen in the sun."
1,cannot agree more....,"with the last reviewer. Those who liked this book and thought it ""touching"" must be mental. This is one of those romances where the hero and heroine constantly-and I mean every minute constantly-fight each other. I've never understood the attraction in those storylines anyway, but this one is a bit extreme. The hero SHOOTS at the heroine, inside her home and holds a gun to her chest-while thinking to himself that he appreciates her ""spunk"" in not flinching as he holds a gun on her? What in the world is supposed to be romantic about that?Basically it's a ""let's treat each other like dogs so we can suddenly realize we love each other the last 25 pages of the book"".Not recommended."
5,Unbelievable!,"I saw Lori play in Lexington, MA in January 2000. ""Hardly Speaking A Word"" is about her son. She captures her feelings of being a mother in ways that is so honest and wonderful. She is a truly gifted writer and singer. If you love Patty Griffin's raw energy, you'll love Lori too."
2,NOT DE FALLA'S BEST,"I BOUGHT THIS RECORDING BECAUSE I LOVE DE FALLA'S MUSIC, AND FOR THE PERFORMERS OF BOTH PIECES. THE NOTES WARN THAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ALMOST A MULTIMEDIA EVENT, WHICH I ASSUME IT WAS AT THE STAR-STUDDED (STRATAS, SIMIONATO, SCHIPPERS)LA SCALA PERFORMANCE. SADLY, THE RECORDING ONLY PRESERVES THE MUSICAL PART, WHICH IS MEDIOCRE AT BEST AND AT TIMES SIMPLY BOMBASTIC FORTISSIMO. LET US RECALL THIS WAS DE FALLA'S LAST MUSICAL COMPOSITION AND THAT IT WAS FINISHED BY ANOTHER--BUT SO WAS PUCCINI'S TURANDOT. ON THE OTHER HAND, ARGENTA AND BERGANZA DELIVER THE GOODS. BUY IT, AS I DID, IF YOU ARE AFTER MUSICAL CURIOSITIES."
2,Disappointing,"If you know very little about the history of English, this video might be good for you. The host is not engaging, and the material presented barely scratches the surface. It is INFERIOR to Robert MacNeil's, The Story of English, which is from the 1980s, but is well done. Sadly, that series of programs is only on VHS. I was very excited about this when I bought it, but have ended up being VERY disappointed."
3,"Too short, too few exercises covered, but good","There should have been more exercises and drills covered, and some basic programs for beginners and intermediate kettlebell users. Pavel is sort of funny, but as others have said the over use of the word ""comrade"" wears a bit after a while. Overall I would say this is good if you can't find or afford a personal KB instruction session."
4,Good for learning basic lifts,"Great video for learning the basic kettle bell moves. Highly motivational and easy to follow. However, this is not a workout video. It just shows you a few of the lifts. He does a great job of providing an indepth instruction and safety measures for each lift. I thought the video would have been like a workout program where he would coach you through a workout routine. It is very good for someone who is just starting with kettlebells."
2,Soft?,"These clips are hard plastic, not the soft silicon advertised. That being said, they sort of do their job of holding your hair but they are super hard and your hair tends to fall out. I only use them when curling my hair so they will work. Also they are a good price."
3,Not for Me,"I'm bi-racial, with thick, curly hair. I don't use these on a regular basis, since I try to avoid heat-styling as much as possible, but I felt like these held my hair in place well, which says something. However, whenever I use them, no matter how gentle I am, I always feel like the tiny teeth are dragging across my hair whenever I put them in or take them out, causing some breakage. I try to open them as wide as possible before doing either or, but there's usually a snag at some point. Of course, there aren't any problems when my hair is straight. So, this may be better for people with straight or wavy hair, rather than curly/coarse/fragile hair."
1,Gets VERY HOT outside,"I'm not sure if mine was defective since the description states that it is a cool to touch toaster, but I was so excited to get my toaster until.. My toaster must sit on the counter and the cord goes up the backside to the wall socket. The instructions state to run two cycles empty first to burn off the new smell. After the second cycle I felt the back of the toaster and was almost burnt! The sides were very hot as well! I am returning mine; and worry about people with small children or the elderly possibly getting hurt with this toaster, as well as concerned the cord may have melted do to the heat."
1,Don't buy it.,"The ""cool touch exterior"" is very hot. The bagel and reheat buttons only function on two slots. The instructions say you can push a defrost button, but it does not exist. The upper edge of the toast is darker than the rest. You could look in and see that the heating wires were not turning red uniformly sure enough the toasting was uneven. We bought a different toaster that did all of this well for half the price. Returned this one."
4,Nick's reviews,The toaster works great and toast even. Good features like the extra lift but doesnot have a bagel control for the right side. Would have gotton 5 stars if it did.
3,Nice but measurements not accurate - Smaller,"The toaster looks great - just as in the photo, however the measurements are way off...toaster is smaller than the measurements indicate. Length is 11 inches, Width is 11 inches & Height is 9 inches. (11x11x9). Much smaller than what I was looking for. Otherwise, cool looking kitchen appliance."
2,"re-cased, same shows","While this DVD has a new name, all but one of the 6 episodes are reruns, seen in the other Kipper DVDs and VHS. While this DVD is 109 minutes long, over 60 minutes of that are clips from other HIT shows, or trailers. ""The little Ghost"" is the only ""new"" Kipper episode there. Unfortunately, this website does not show that this DVD is full of reruns, so there is no way to know if you are buying something new. The same problem exists with the Kipper show ""Water Play"", it has all used episodes except for one."
3,you could help out you know,"If you bought the video and your complaint is that nobody anywhere says what episodes are on it, why don't you list which ones there are in your review? I'm not concerned if it duplicates other videos/dvds. I am concerned if it duplicates ones I already have."
2,be good for extreme badminton,"purchased these last year and have only used them twice. they glow ok at night but if there are streetlights around or any other type of lights you cant see these enough to play with. next these are very small and heavier then regular birdies. that means these things are EXTREMELY fast, you cant play a casual game with these things. even the slightest tap sends the bird flying 40-50 feet or more. its like a regular birdie would be like hitting a softball with a baseball bat and these would be like hitting a small 1-2 inch solid rubber bouncy ball with the same baseball bat and having it fly out of the park. just play during daylight or inside a big building at night."
2,Nice design but too small,I was hopping for a bigger shuttlecock to play with my daughters. It still does the trick but I am somehow disspointed.
2,Loaded with pictures but lacking in anything else,"Its packed with pictures of the Pros and big names of bodybuilding at the time of writing but thats about it.Its nutrition nutrition section consists of about 20 pages, 25% of which is pictures, which is poor considering that nutrition accounts for 75% of bodybuilding.The is very general and does not cover specifics, it's just one glorified magazine."
1,"A Very General Workout Book, not useful","This book is very general about working out in general. Its more like a Reader's Digest of alot of body builders tips and hints about working out. The book contains some essential information about workout, the nunber of sets, what exercises to do, how to work the muscle and how to become a successful body builder. But, they are too general, it doesnt go into very specific detail. And to be honest, it doesnt really tell me something that common sense can not tell me. It doesnt go into detail the key to success in body building. I would suggest Arnold's Encyclopedia, Arnold Education of a body builder. These two books are great guides for going in depth about working out and setting the right mental attitude. Would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Let down...,"I hard already purchased this package in the form of the Sturgis concert and did not realize they had cut out some of the material from that show. If you do not have any 38 Special concert DVD's this is a good DVD for you, if you do have others shows, buyer beware...pay attention to the detail on the package."
3,Shame on you ADV!,"This is NOT a complete collection. And the english version is so horrible, it must have turned a lot of people off to the show. :([...]This collection is missing the specials and movies. It only contains the original shorts. No ""Oh! Mikey Hardcore"" on this set!"
3,Okay For A Starting Point,"This book mainly is like the title says: a primer for a reader who has never delved into the Wonderful World of Bukowski. It contains illustrations and a brief biography of buk's life. It's not really essential reading for his fans, but it's still fun to read anything involving THE MAN. If it pulls the uninitiated into Buk's books then that is a great achievement."
1,Not worth your time,"This book was clearly created for any type of business start up and contains very general information about starting up a business. There are many parts of the book that are completely unrelated to childcare, as in packagine, sales tax and beleive it or not mail order and catalog businesses... There is some good information about things to do when starting up a business, but you can get this help from other books that also have more childcare specific inforamation."
3,Change Band,"Bank design unsatisfactory. From link to link it bubbles (arches) so the band does not lie flat around the wrist, I am returning it."
5,Goji juice,Didn't feel it till the second day - then I noticed my vision was clearer and I felt less cloudy -I take it in the morning a half hour after CLO and organic butter -- very good product
1,Preservatives,"This juice is not as pure as I was hoping. Has preservatives and is made from concentrate, and also includes other juice concentrates."
3,nice old hits,"I really enjoyed the first 2 CD's in this collection, however the LIVE CD would not play at all in 2 different CD players which was disappointing to me."
5,Surprisingly Good Quality,"Usually when one buys a show's merchandise, they get badly made items whose only purpose seems to be making money off the fans. I expected this when I bought it, but I was nicely surprised; this hat is very high quality. None of it seems poorly made or cheap, (I do not feel like I must be delicate when putting it on) and it could be mistaken for a normal, non-cosplay hat. In addition it was shipped to me early- the expected shipping time was 3 to 5 days, and it got here in two. There was nothing bad about this product, I do recommend it."
5,Essential reading for Legion fans!,"Let me start by saying if you're not a fan of the Legion of Superheroes this book will be very limited interest for you. There's some nice insights from creators like Jim Shoot, Keith Giffen and Paul Levitz. You'll get to compare how earlier creators approached comics as a job while later creators bring much more passion and interest to the subject.BUT if you're a Legion fan, this is the motherload. Every major Legion creator from the 50s to the 90s (the book was published in 2003). While some interviews are bit dull and self-serving others offer great insights into how the series evolved and the clashes and over-sized egos involved.With more classic Legion books being reprinted this book is more relevant than ever."
5,Wayne's World game - birthday gift,"I cannot give you an exact review of the product since it has not been open, however the box is still wrapped in plastic and in great shape!"
1,disappointed,"I have a small pond in the backyard and thought this was perfect. I unpacked it and went to plug it in--and no plug. It has 2 little prongs like a grounding wire, and the instructions say put it in the ""power pack""-I did not have a clue what to do so I returned it. Maybe I am just not Pond savvy but to keep others from being disappointed I thought I would share my experience."
5,One of the best get started books on ATM,"An excellent book for those who are interested in the new wave of data technology. I highly recommend it to EE's, business development managers and IT managers. It is very easy to read and has become a part of my easy access library.D. Akiu Jr.,Global Business Development Manager, AT&T"
3,It is just fine.,"As a Linux rookie, I found this book very useful. It has very topics and materials that you need to know about Redhat. The book taught me form the begining to advanced level.However, as a result of putting every things in it. It seems to me that lots of topics in this book are less explained as it should be. That means I have learned from the book but I could not really make use of them(as a network administrator).IT DOES JUST FINE FOR ""LINUX NEWBIE""."
3,The Malcontenta: A Kathy and Brock Mystery by Barry Maitland,"After having read and enjoyed ""The Marx Sisters"" by Barry Maitland, I was eager to read ""The Malcontenta"". While entertaining, it is not as excellent as his previous work.Kathy and Brock still make a good team and I am looking forward to reading more of these books.""The Malcontenta"" is set in a Health Spa. I have found, over many years, that although Health Spas and Cruise Ships would seem to be ideal settings for mysteries, they usually disappoint.Nonetheless, this is a good read and I would not hesitate to recommend it, particularly to lovers of English mysteries."
3,A bit Disappointing,"i was a bit disappointed with this movie, i bought it thinking it showed the Monkey Style , it doesnt however,it is a man who is sent away from home by his father who is a fighting master, to only return when he is a good fighter.he pretty much wanders around spying on people and getting in fights with a group of evil kung fu guys, he gets set to learn kung fu from a master he comes across but the master is killed by the group mentioned above. the master while dying tells him to be a great fighter to watch reflections in the water and to copy himself and he would surely be a great man.He studies the movements of a crab and of each member of the group and then gets revenge.okay movie , a little boring and no Monkey style."
4,...but not quite as loud as the Who!,"Out of print for many years, mainly due to the original limited edition LP being available only through the mail, direct from the artist himself! (Could this make Martyn the godfather of the ""D.I.Y."" concept?) A must for any 70's music fan, especially for the bonus tracks featuring the late great Paul Kossoff (!) on guitar (fidelity-wise, alas,these tracks are quite dicey, but fascinating for Kossoff fans nonetheless). Now, if more record companies could be encouraged to use the CD reissue concept in this manner--making truly rare treasures available again, as opposed to the ""newly digitally remastered version of the same old title you have likely already purchased and discarded as an LP, cassette, 8-Track, Reel-to-Reel, Virgin Vinyl, and original CD version!"""
5,Introduction to Two-Dimensional Design: Understanding Form and Function,"I've been a Graphic Designer for 20 years. While taking a 2-D course recently, I found this book a well-written resource."
4,Good Pillow,"I ordered this pillow to go with the oversize hammock I got for my husband for Father's Day. It looks great on the white rope hammock and is a nice contract to the green grass below. However, the first rain we had the pillow did bleed a little onto the hammock, but we really didn't care since all of it is for outdoor use. The pillow is comfortable and a good size since our hammock is extra wide. It also dries out nicely after it rains."
4,Here is the track list,1 Variations on an Ivesian Suggestion2 Portrait of an Inner Landscape3 Mona Lisa4 The Angel's Face in the Virgin of the Rocks5 Sketches for Engines of War6 The Mind that is Forever Curious and the Spirit Eternal7 Portrait of Penelope8 The Weaver's Art9 Vigil10 The Suitors11 Subterfuge and Restoration12 Etude No. 113 Etude No. 214 Etude No. 315 Etude No. 416 Etude No. 517 Tango No. 2 -- for George Grosz
4,Good book,"Beautiful pictures! Easy to follow recipies. The 2-3 things I've made have come out well. I do wish though that it would suggest accompaniments to the chicken dishes. Nice variety of cooking methods and sauces, should be able to please just about any palate."
5,A book you can actually use!,"Cooking Light Cook's Essential Recipe Collection has produced a true stand-out with this volume about preparing chicken. Every single recipe in this book is tested, and illustrated with great photographs of the completed meal. If you are looking for a way to take a simple, basic food beyond the every-day, this is definitely the one for you. The directions are very clear, and you won't find yourself scratching your head wondering about weird and mysterious ingredients. This is good food done well with great imagination!Highly recommended!"
3,Not quite crisp,"While I can savor a sloppy splendor behind post-bop epic ""Buffalo '98"" and appreciate many of its off-kilter traits throughout, HA's whole discs tend to sound stretched out and often flirt with dead spaces."
4,Teach Yourself Microsoft Excel 2000 Visually,"Excellent - easy to read, understand, use. Very simple, clear and concise, with excellent illustrations. Highly recommend it. Well worth the price."
4,an excellent non-fiction thriller,This book is a page turner and a must for people who believe like I do that the human mind has no limits.
5,So bad that is was good,"I have seen bad movies before and this was one of the best bad movie that I have ever seen. In other words, if you like bad movies, movies with plot holes and stupid graphics this is one for you."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Saw this on SciFi channel one Saturday night (which is always a bad sign as that's when they show their real stinkers). The characters are terribly annoying and foolish. So unless you have some mind-numbing additive on the popcorn, I recommend avoiding."
3,Totally Awesome,I really enjoyed this cd . It was a present to me and I had never listenned to Relient K before. But after I did I was hooked. I now want to get all of their cds. This is a must have cd.
5,preparation,"In 1990 I found a small mixed breed chihuahua/daushaund mix.In 1992 while on vacation at the beach went into a shop in search of sun screen lotion and browsed thru a table of discounted items.There was a book with the image of my dog Francesco on the cover.I read it and it brought tears to my eyes.Although Francesco was very young at the time I knew the day would come when I ,like ""Mommie"" would have to face the inevitable.Francesco died 2 weeks ago and I took the book ""A Little Dog Like You"" off of my bookshelf and read it again.I was saddened to learn tonight that Rosemary Sutcliff had died in 1992 as I wanted to let her know how her book helped me to prepare for one of my greatest losses...Rosemary is with her Pippin I am sure .Carrie"
5,Love it,The ornament was just as described - the perfect addition to my growing Little Mermaid collection (and the Hallmark Keepsake ornaments in particular).
4,Impressive debut,"The Jamaican reality doesn't get more authentic than this! Ross portrays complex and believable female characters - tragically flawed, undauntingly resouceful. The novel is a tale told with passion and integrity. All the Blood is Read contains all the necessary elements for a fast- paced contemporary story, as well as providing ""not to be ignored"" questions for the soul."
5,Heininger tire step,The tire step arrived on time. It has not been used yet so I can't comment at this time.
1,Not worth it.,The stories are very uninteresting. No attempt to explain the possibility of hauntings. Not worth it.
5,Spring Awakening is an indepth look at teen life.Brilliant!,Recently observing an adapted performance of Spring Awakening I was stunned at the confronting and amazingly written script of Frank Wedekind. Although written over one hundred years ago the issues involved are still plaguing the children of todays generation. The play is interesting and easily related to by teenage children aswell as older audiences. I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching the play along with all my companions
1,Discontinued,The reason you have not recieved this product is because it has been discountinued and reformulated to Phyto Organics Theratin Extreme Moisture Shampoo.
3,Shipped immediately,"Vendor shipped product immediately. Loaded on my desk top, but not laptop. Vendor gave a download site for software when I notified him. Would buy from him again."
4,great deal,"I recieved the disk and cable as expected. I installed it on my computer. I still could not get it to work so I called customer service the person who helped me advised me to contact Motorola which I did. They helped me out I was very pleased with there service as well, however I still cannot load my music to my phone because my computer is not new enough to recognize my phone. I am still very pleased with the product and the service I recieved. I just need a new computer. I felt the price was very fair because I had gone to Motorola first and they wanted alot more money for the program that I paid less than $ 5.00 for. Thank You"
1,Does *Not* Work With Verizon Phones!!,I wish i had known this before buying this software. Apparently Verizon has their own software and only they can give you software to sync your phone to your computer. It took a call to Motorola for me to figure out the problem. I have a RAZR v3m.
4,Good Tool,"I purchased the Motorola Phone tools and cable to unlock my phone using a free downloaded program. I did this successfully, and am now able to use my Razr with any wireless service around the world. I also use the product to swap photos and keep my phone book up to date."
1,Phone tools did not work on my phone,"Motorola Phonetools did not work in my Razr v3 phone. I called Moto-support and was told to get the next version. How do I know if the next version will work of not? The version I purchased was suppose to do the trick. I even research what the problem could be and downloaded a speacial driver, and this did not get it to work. So I am stuck with software that is not doing me any good."
4,"Finally, s/w that really works with the Razr V3m","Used the 'other' Motorola software to no avail, this one really works. Just remember to change your phone setting from USB to modem, works like a charm. And, unlike the prior software, you really can make your own ringtones with this one."
4,Needed some software updates for Win7,"The cable was of better quality than I was expecting for the price. The software had to auto-install 4 updates to work with Win7 (32bit). But everything works fine and for the price , I am quite happy."
1,ridiculous,"my wife has accumulated bunches of pictures on her old razr and didn't want to spend the $$ to e-mail them so when i saw this cable for a few bucks, i figured this was the solution. i'm no computer geek but i'm not an idiot. i've assembled two computers from scratch and do my own repairs and upgrades. this cable and software was impossible to use. i spent an hour-and-a-half and finally gave up. what a ridiculous product to make it so hard to use. pretty happy i didn't spend the original forty or fifty bucks to buy it, tho."
3,Not Very Satisfied,"I ordered this book for my history class three weeks before our exam. I got it with 3-5 days standard shipping. I thought I'd receive it on time, if not a week or a week and a half late, as with my other orders from this site. I ended up getting it 3 1/2 weeks later, the day after my exam. Lucky I passed with a pretty decent grade but with the book I'm sure I would have aced the test. I wouldn't have minded so much, but my professor usually takes material from either the notes he's given in class or the info from the textbook to use on our tests. Having the book on time really would have helped increase my grade, so I definitely wasn't too happy about that. So overall the book is helpful and has useful info, but I was extremely disappointed with the shipping."
5,worlds together,thanks for the quick reply to this purchase. all recieved fast and condition as pormised. thx again.
1,It works so well in my husband's car...,"My husband bought the DICE for his '07 Prius. It was so cool! It works great. He loves it. For Christmas, he got me a DICE for my '07 Prius. I hate it. It seems to stop playing parts of every other song and then resumes. It's really annoying. My husband swapped out his device for mine and he has no issues. I have the same issues with his DICE in my car and he's not having any issues with my DICE in his car. Our cars are different models. But that shouldn't matter, should it? Neither of us have a CD changer and that's what it hooks up to. I guess now that it's February it's out of warranty so I'm stuck with it. Maybe I can sell it on eBay. It's hit and miss, but overwhelmingly judging from these reviews, it's more often miss than hit. I have nothing good to say about the DICE except that it works great in my husband's Prius."
4,It all started with me looking for a certain song...,"With the help of a fellow Amazonian, I was able to track down the song & who the original artist was (The Troggs). But further reseach led me to Wet Wet Wet, as they performed the song in one of my favorite movies (Four Weddings & a Funeral). So I purchase the Greatest Hits of this English Group & was pleasantly surprised. I really, really like this group! The lead singer (Marti Pellow) has got this VOICE, which led me to purchase 2 more of his Solo C.D.'s (Smile) & (Marti Pellow Sings the Hits of Wet Wet Wet & Smile). I really like both of them. And to think it all started with a song I heard, playing in my head (Love Is All Around) which I thought was Ann Murray but turned out to be Marti Pellow from Wet Wet Wet (same voice in my head). I would recommend starting out with Wet Wet Wet Greatest Hits & go from there. You'll be pleasently surprised. And the same goes with Marti Pellow's first Solo C.D. ""Smile""."
5,Fantastic stories behind the pictures,"Waldemar Januszczak goes far beyond the typical art critic's analysis of paintings and brings both them and the artists to life in a way that you will remember. I have seen many art history DVDs and they are too often dry and dull. Too often, the art historian or critic will point out the obvious features of a painting (pyramidal composition, light/shadow, formation of geometric shapes within, etc,) with minimal references to meanings and ignore the real story of the painting. This series shows the depth of understaning that Januszczak brings to the field and is able to impart to the viewer. I didn't find his presentation at all egotistical, but if so, he deserves to feel that way because he backs it up."
3,"Interesting, but...","A little disappointed that the host rambles on occasionally, and strays off the subject of the painting. He gives lots of details about the painters life history. I guess I wanted more details about the painting, not the painter."
4,What a ride!,"This book is supposedly the last in the Straw Man series. I rather hope there are more -- I like the characters and the entire concept was clever. The basic idea is that there is a sort of secret society that is thousands of years old. These people consider themselves evolutionarily different from the rest of us -- they believe we have succumbed to a virus that makes us altruistic. They are not and are responsible for many of the worst events of history. That is an original idea for a mystery thriller. The hero and heroine battle these people through three books. In particular, the protagonist's twin brother is one of the worst. This would make an interesting film -- the star could play both the bad guy and the good guy. The first book in the series was interesting, but I had doubts. The second one was much better (and the writing is probably the best of the three). The third one makes a perfect end. I recommend these books if you like this kind of reading."
4,Great Book!,"Very well written book, and it was a nice finish to the trilogy. Would love to see the author continue with this story for another trilogy."
2,Hardly Concepts for Jazz/Rock Piano DVD,"If you're an absolute beginner, you will not be able to understand what they're saying. If you know what major, minor, and blues scales are then there's just about nothing you can learn from this DVD. It's a serious waste of money if you're interested in learning Jazz/Rock piano concepts.The only reason I gave it two stars instead one is because I did get two things out the DVD. One, after watching it, I knew it was much simpler to play his music than I might expect from looking at the sheet music. Two, I'd never again buy anything published by Homespun videos."
1,ACE PHOT DIGITAL,"Ace Photo Digital is the type of company that goes on vacation for almost a week, has no intentions of selling you an item, and blows you off until you call them. They used the bait and switch tech on me saying that the package I bought was a mistake of amazons (which it wasn't) and they wouldn't honor my purchase. Very unprofessional company. Asked for a manager to call me, and never did. They do not care about their customers. It was a $150 camera w/ 2 lenses, tripod, flash, and case. They ended up canceling my order when I told them not to. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!"
2,"one hilarious episode, two overdone","I thoroughly enjoyed the second of the three episodes--the expert seducer and the brainless wife. The first and the third were overdrawn and overacted jokes that were not hilarious in themselves and were overdone and unpleasant, not saved by the occasional wit and dead-pan rapid fire delivery. In any case, none of the characters is likable or admirable."
3,"nice looking, matches OEM",This bumper fit perfectly. It looks almost exactly like the OEM bumper. The downfall is that after a couple years it started to show some rust on the surface. But it still serves my purpose.
3,Excellent multiplayer fun,"This is just like any worms game. One flaw is that it needs to zoom in closer. Unless you have a really big tv, mine's 32"" you will have a hard time seeing the worms and mines on the field."
1,What a load of old ...,"It is not because Kim is fat, ugly, or inarticulate that I would not recommend his book. Nor is it because he is a failed PhD History student from UCLA, but because this man is so obnoxious and unintelligent that it is unreal! I have had the displeasure of meeting this man and seeing the offence he causes to many people with his badly-argued trite (note: to sit in a room full of biblical scholars and claim that you know more than they because you are an [albeit failed] historian is not a good idea). I would recommend this book as an example of historical scholarship in as much the same way as Eric von Dänicken's Chariots of the Gods."
4,"A solid racer, but where's the '67?","If you're looking for a solid racing game for not a lot of green, & are a fan of the Ford Mustang, look no further.If there's one thing wrong with this game, it's the lack of '67 (the best year for the Mustangs!) models.And why the hell did they put two '80's Mustangs in the game? 80's Mustangs sucked!"
4,Multi-Purpose Clipper,"As the item description states it's for a balder ultra-close haircut. Great for beard and trim. It's a bit heavy, but my favorite. So far, so good!"
3,"Really great clippers, unless you have any moles on your head","Really great clippers, unless you have any moles on your head. If so, prepare for a bloody mess. These are really great, however they do not adjust if you are using them without an attachment, so if you happen to be someone like myself who happens to have a few moles on my dome, beware."
5,good soundtrack,"the oddest video game soundtrack I own, and one of the most original. it's a very eerie listening experience. I bought it on Halloween and decided it would make for perfect creepy music to play.I definately recommend it."
4,Great item.,"My friend's dog is addicted to this ball so I got him another one for Christmas. The ball that actually came to my house was yellow (not purple as pictured), but neither the dog or I cared. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the shipping was as much as the item itself. It's up to the buyer to decide if a ball (that will probably be destroyed at some point) is worth twice it's price just to get it delivered."
3,Ultimate Silence,"The octagon is surounded by pure blackness, you can't see the crowd. When the fighters are fighting there are hardly any cheers because of the japanese tradition of respect for the fighters. The first match pits bad boy Tank Abbott against japanese wrestler Yoji Anjo, classic Tank. Conan Silvera and Kazushi Sakuraba are stopped by a bad call and later fight again and the bad call is avenged. Frank Shamrock's UFC debut against Kevin Jackson answers all the questions wheter he can fight in MMA competition. Vitor Belfort shows a different fighting style in his superfight proving he not just a striker. The final match shows defending champion Maurice Smith take on Greco Roman wrestler Randy Couture, slow paced match only shows the true science of the ground attack. All in all a good 3 stars. The only bad reviews you see are the ones who don't understand the technique involved in fighting, it's not all punches and kick's!"
1,Disposable Dishwasher,"Got my daughter this dishwasher for her small kitchen. It broke after about 7 months. Avanti replaced it under factory warranty. The replacement took about three months to get. It was a tailgate delivery and the delivery truck would not enter the subdivision my daughter lives in. Had to drive to the entrance of the subdivision to load it in my car. Their customer service was poor . Second replacement dishwasher broke after about one year. Both dishwashers left glasses spotty and generally washed plates and silverware poorly leaving a film, and that is with the glassware additive. It did not like the soft gel-like soap packets, only hard soap packets. Bottom line-wash by hand and save your money. Another Chinese piece of junk."
4,Definitely very good for beginner,"Definitely very good for beginner, although I have to agree that flipping pages back and forth during the exercise is not very convenient. Authors could position material better or include a separate workout sheet. Most of the excersices can be done at home."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still good!","I was rather impressed with the changes from the Utah Saints over the almost 10 year span from the first CD release. The musichas a much more ""techno"" type feel, but is mixed well, and you can tell alot of work was put into the album. The album is a great addition to any techno music fan's collection!"
5,Youth Minister's point of view,"It is great. Finally, I can quit carrying two bibles around to camp, retreats and the such. I gave these as gifts this year to a good friend who also does camp as well as my nephew."
5,Excellent book,"When I saw this book listed at 99 cents, I figured it wouldn't be very good, but I needed something to read and the price was good. WOW, was I surprised. An absolute page-turner, strong story, no lame deus ex machina at the end. No politics, no moralizing, just good, solid story-telling. I will definitely buy other books by this author, and I'm willing to pay more for them!"
2,Not the best read.,There were a lot of unbeliveable things happened in the book but all in all it wasn't that bad. What turned me off was the constant using God's name in vain. To me this served no purpose other than disgust the reader. I will find another author.
4,GOOD BOOK,"GOOD READING, RATHER WELL WRITTEN AND INTERESTING PLOT. SUSPENSE IS UP TO THE END.VERY INTERTAINING AND EASY TO READ"
2,Boye Latch Hook,"This latch hook is not made the best, the little lever that pulls the yarn through broke after about a week. The ones with the wooden handle are made MUCH better.."
3,Lots of Inaccurate Information,"This book is probably for someone who is experienced with PC hardware. Yet, for anyone that is will find quite a few mistakes in the hardware section.1. SCSI ID 0 is the highest priority.2. Celeron has 128 Meg of L2 cache built in the processor.3. USB connector information differs from page to page!There are a few more things, but these are actually quite important, especially the SCSI ID priority. I would recommend Transcender A+ Simulation over this one. Transcender gives a much better explanation as to ""why"" this is the correct answer and ""what"" each choise is and as to ""why"" it was not the correct answer."
1,Not very satisfied,I can't comment on how well the item works. The first one arrived with a broken roller release switch. I contacted Amazon and they sent another one immediately (I returned the first). That second one also arrived with a broken roller release switch. I wasn't willing to wait and risk another one coming broken. I returned the second for a refund and bought a Staples laminator. I was very disappointed with these items..
3,Instant Gratification,"The preschool I work at purchased this product and used it for approximately three years. In the beginning it worked wonderfully. It was a good price and it had recieved fantastic reviews from others who recently purchased it. After 2 years things started going wrong. First the preheating function went out and you were no longer able to tell when it was warm enough. Next, the rollers would randomly stop working and pages wouldn't finish, so I had to use the release function to pull the pages back out. Finally, the release function stopped working, and the page was stuck jammed in the rollers. The inside is so stuck together, it's nearly impossible to manually take the pieces apart.I would suggest paying a bit more for a better quality laminator. This one is good for instant gratification, but in the long run all you'll get is a headache."
2,WARNING - Disappointed in Hanns HW191D,"WARNING - I received my Hanns HW191D monitor over a month ago. As of this date I am unable to get the 1440 X 900 resolution. After searching several forum for information and doing as suggested, downloading the driver, directly from Hanns, it still will not convert to that resolution. Additionally, adjusting the screen is on the side and very confusing with NO DIRECTIONS included whatsoever to which buttons do what or how to use them in what order.Finally a forum suggested upgrading the Bios which I will do in the next few days. This is an extra, unforseen cost and hazardous manuever.If it goes wrong it destroys the functionality of my computer.You can never use it again. It's buy a computer time. Mine is not a junk computer. It's a Pentium 3, but 933 MHZ, 100 GHD and 1 GB Memory.Frankly, as I write this I'm wondering why I have not returned it. A few bucks more for an easier functioning monitor would be worth the trouble."
1,Hanns G bad company,"Someone reviewed this monitor and says they had it for 2 years. Now, why wouldthey do that? Probably a plant. These monitors have a terrible track recordfor burning out after a year, and the warranty doesn't apply...oh, yeah, the companysays there is a three year warranty, but not for the LCD screen...ergo, any problemafter one year with this monitor, and the company will tell you to go fish."
5,Works great,"I received the item it great condition, brand new lol i cant wait for my daughter to use it on Christmas"
3,this was a interesting book,"this book talked about several interesting events during the Civil War and is worth reading. It isn't very long so even the casual reader can finish it in a few days. I'd recomend another one of Webb Garrison's books ""The Unknown Civil War"" which talks about most of the same stuff and some other things"
4,Great playing!,I love Hoyle Casino! The only problem was that I was not able to create a character. No problem...I still played the slots! Woo hoo!
3,Very similar to the prior version,"I liked the prior version and bought this update. The variety of casino games is good and I like the layout. I don't have any crash issues like others. My rig is a AMD Athlon 64 4000+, 4 GB DC RAM, 256 MB nVida and WinXP Pro."
4,excellent product,very happy with its performance. I'll reorder this or any one of the other scents again.
3,Didn't work for me,"The bike rack looks great, however it did not work on my 2006 Rav4. I read a number of reviews before I purchased, and it looked promising. However, the holes in the mounting plate were not close to the bolts on my spare. I needed to return it...and leave my bikes at home."
1,Great idea but product was cheap and...,"The needles are very different from what you see in the picture here on Amazon. Honestly, it's false advertising. I'm quite upset. I feared the cactus needles would be too sharp but the problem is quite the opposite!When I opened the box and took a look at it, I thought maybe the needles had become flattened in shipping. This was not the case. The needles are simply very different from the photo. They just suck. When I tried using this on my back it felt like I was wiping my skin with a big plastic pickle. This is an awesome idea for a back scratcher but the product is a big failboat. Maybe it used to be a better quality (like the way the picture looks!) and they changed it? I'm very unhappy!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A wealth of egg dishes not found in ordinary cookbooks.,"Over five dozen recipes for eggs are presented in book packed with winning egg uses, from make-head tomato 'nests' holding eggs to steamed eggs with vinegar and herbs. Country Egg, City Egg is for the egg fan who needs no visual embellishment: recipes are very easy to reproduce without them and provide a wealth of egg dishes not to be found in every cookbook."
2,Zoom Adjustment Really Hard,"The Scope optics are better than average, but the zoom adjustment is Very Hard to move. In fact so hard I sent the scope back for a refund."
2,humidity,This is a nice camera but not recommended for a trip to the rain forest. The humidity seems to lock the camera up35x zoom
4,Big gadget for a small price,I was surprised at just how compact the CANON DC210 was when I opened the box. It fits snugly in my palm (and I have pretty thick hands) and I was able to maneuver the controls very comfortably. I was worried about the positioning of the battery but that turned out to be a non-issue. I'd highly recommend this as a beginner to mid-level digital camcorder for anyone interested in digital videos.
5,Just what I needed,"I started reusing an video recorder that needed a 32MB Memory Stick, which was hard to find. Found it on amazon and got it quickly."
5,A gratifying debut.,"Cyndi Thomson's first album ""My World"" has beautiful, heartfelt lyrics, but I do disagree with a few of the people on here who say that the songs sound too much alike. The only songs that have a slight similarity are ""If You Were Mine"" and ""Things I Would Do"" because they have the same concept, which is things she would do if she had her lover back and things she'd do to get him back.Besides that, this album shines brilliantly on songs like ""I Always Liked That Best,"" ""What I Really Meant To Say,"" ""If You Were Mine,"" ""There Goes The Boy"" and ""I'm Gone,"" which is a very fun, upbeat tune.Another good thing about this album is that Cyndi co-wrote eight of the eleven songs on here. She has such a unique and twangy voice, which is perfect for country music today. I definitely think you should give ""My World"" a listen. You're in for a pleasant surprise if you do."
3,"peter fonda and derbra raffinn do a take on ""the african queen""","ok,this is a very silly movie and while i can't tell you why i really liked it.peter fonda is the whole show here and he shines as drunk pilot hired to take doc. raffinn into jungle to find doc. looking for race of (wait for it) lizzard men. like i said silly but fonda's charm and the heat he has with raffinn make this cross drama,sci-fi, and horror movie works,(at least for me). most will find it dumb,but if you give it a chance you may like it."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"I hated this movie so much I felt I had to spare anyone else from renting this.I have a more than generous sense of humor, I can funny in almost anything. I am bowled away that anyone could like this movie. The humor is beyond dumb, and am shocked that anyone would fund such a rotten movie. The humor (word used loosely) was just plain stupid! Never did I buy that the alleged hero from any war. He was such a wimp. So much was done in poor taste, but that still is not why I hated the film, it was just not funny at all in anyway."
1,MacGruber is a pathetic movie,"Save your money , this movie has few laughs and is one of the worst films of 2010.Seriously if this is the sort of garbage Hollywood are dishing up now then the movie industry is in trouble.If you want laughs watch Spy Hard or Pineapple Express , l can understand Val Kilmar making this film because he is a classic B grade actor these days."
1,Stupid and Tasteless,"What a waste of time and money. Who is dumb enough to invest in trash like this? Worse, if you watch it, you'll never get that time back."
4,Patty and Selma Would Approve,"The Eighties TV show ""MacGyver"" would be the obvious reference point for ""MacGruber"" but it reminded me of another show from that era, the cult sitcom ""Sledge Hammer"". A lot of action comedies are pretty lame i.e. ""Get Smart"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"". ""MacGruber"" is more comic than action oriented and the laugh quotient is pretty high. Credit star Will Forte with going to the comic edge with his profanely lovable title character and making it an enjoyable viewing experience. This film may not be for everyone judging from the number of negative reviews but I liked ""MacGruber' alot."
2,Complete waste of time,"Refers to the unrated version - This really ranks among the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It had lots of potential but turned into a total waste of time. Any redeeming moments were repeatedly neutralized by moronic attempts at humor. Might work in skits, but becomes old very quickly in a feature length film."
3,MacGross,"The movie starts out like a Zucker and Zucker five star Rambo spoof. The dialogue was witty and quick. MacGruber is coaxed out of retirement to assemble a team to fight his arch rival. All is well, then we find out MacGruber is a complete idiot, as he accidentally blows up his own team. At this point the movie digresses to become outright gross. In the next scene he is very graphically asking to perform oral and anal sex with an army officer in order to coax him to join his new team. This scene was completely disgusting, poorly written, and totally needless. The next real highlight was the sex scene. This was laugh out loud funny, but didn't carry the movie. Much of the movie is crude and sophomoric. Sometimes it works well, while other times it works as well as a bad National Lampoon movie. Disgusting is not always funny. Not for kids or prudes. Did Val Kilmer get fat or what?"
2,"in most ways, worse than sabretooth.............","this movie has one of the worst final sequenses ever. a sabre from a sabre tooth statue, falls on this guy, and lands in his mouth (real corny), and looks very bad. this movie exadurates with the gore, not nearly as much as pteradactyl, but still has to much. i must have counted 5 people who died from decapitaction ihn the first half hour. the bad points are listed below:-bad acting-bad plot-why was the guy from lissy mugwyr in this?!-bad evry thingthe few good points are listed below:-pretty funny-descesent cgi evects(beter than sabre tooth!)-thats all i can hink of....this movie is barly worth a hire, only good for laughs."
2,Jaws it Isn't,"It is difficult to find anything positive to say about ATTACK OF THE SABRETOOTH. If you attach it to any fright film about cloning, then you have this one. The acting is abysmal. Ditto for the FX, the scripting, and the dialogue. The plot concerns a money hungry hotel tycoon who has invested his dwindling fortune in cloning sabretooth tigers. He has succeeded and then opens his theme park (Primal Park) to well heeled investors. Naturally, some valley girl teens and dude types get involved, most of whom wind up as disposable tiger munchies. It is axiomatic that such films contain some exposed female skin, and those rare moments were the highlights. What ATTACK OF THE SABRETOOTH exposes is the all too often retold stereotype of the stupid victim, one whose obtuseness leads to his demise. You would think that a growling noise would discourage some undressing teens, but they go ahead right up till crunch time. There is nothing worthwhile here. Even the female flesh parts pale too quickly."
2,Flimsy and hard to read,"This scale was a replacement for a similar-style mechanical scale I'd successfully used for many years, but was lost when loaned to a friend. This scale is cheaply made, flimsy, and the numbers on the weight measure are so small and the differential between the hash marks so narrow, it is difficult to read. The bowl is so lightweight, it is ""tippy"". It might be useful for small and occassional weighing needs, but I would not recommend it. I tested the weighing accuracy and it was within normal limits."
2,"Good for classics, horrible for fighting games.","If you're looking for a good, classic mame/arcade stick, this is for you. It's nice construction, sturdy, and will get the job done.That is, until you need some finesse with your stick. In my PS3 the X-Arcade single lags horribly. Why? Because the adapter is a PS2 adapter that plugs into a PS3 adapter! What a horrible idea. It causes terrible lag to the point that the only way you're going to win is predicting the future.For classic games, it won't be a problem. If your idea is MAME, that is. But if you want to go with fighting games, put down your money on the 79 dollar Street Fighter IV fight stick instead (automatically works with PCs as well as consoles, whether for PS3 or Xbox360).Save your money.- Ryan"
2,Hazeled Out Of Control,"For somebody like Kelly Clarkson, whom has really tried to make a stand in making some good songs, really hasn't done very well within doing that. Her latest single is not a very well put song to match. Behind These Hazel Eyes, the third single from her 2004 record Breakaway, tries to put her within a harder kind of sound. The song doesn't really fit that bill for Kelly, whom has has not done very well with making songs that sound more adult, but act more like songs that are just teen-flavored at the moment. I really didn't like this song that much, and I am just a little tired of it.Song: D+"
1,Very bad quality.,"Don't buy these. Am getting a 75% failure rate. Very frustrating. Buy a better brand, these shouldn't even be on the market, they are a waste of time. I didn't buy from Amazon, I bought from Office Max but want to get the word out that these are a horrible product."
4,eraser,"Not a bad little electric eraser. I sharpened the eraser to a point using sand paper and use it to erase fine areas in my graphite portraits. Just be sure not to let the eraser get too short or the metal that holds the eraser will rub the paper. Not a bad product, especially for the price."
2,Professional Veterinary Otoscope,This is hard to see inside the ear. The lense needs to be stronger. I wonder if there is a way to purchase a stronger lense?
2,Theracane Video,The video does show you how to use the TheraCane. It is a low budget and dated video.
4,Great social commentary,"I first saw this movie on HBO around 1990 and immediately took to it. It provides great insight into Jewish social sensibilities in Greater New York during the 1950s. The 2 principal actors, Richard Benjamin and Ali MacGraw, are well-suited for their respective roles. In the midst of a July-September romance, Neil and Brenda expose various prejudices, while trying to conform to expectations placed on them by their parents and by society. We all know that a rich Daddy's princess from Briarcliff Manor wouldn't really develop a serious romance with a poor boy from the Bronx, but it is still interesting to see her go through the motions. When the academic year returns, Brenda finds a convenient way to drop Neil without saying so much. This leaves her free to go back to Radcliffe to continue pursuing her MRS. degree."
2,Does Not Hold Up Well,"Does not hold up well to today's standards of film making, given outdated morality and repressed sexual mores of the time. Even the ending is kind of muddled and confusing. In fact one could say that the whole movie is pretty boring actually. Yet, the ""wedding scene"" was and is iconic of consumerism, greed and materialsm of a type that has not been matched since."
3,Strong Mint Tea,"The tea is fine. I didn't find it that tasty ... I find I prefer Mint Medly or PLantation Mint. I guess I also prefer individually wrapped bags to preserve freshness. But nothing wrong with product; just a matter of my taste, I think"
2,Strictly for kids,And im not even sure of that either. Will not let you configure for legit up and down throttle move. Up is up and down is down. Thats it! graphics are cute. Thats it! Maybe in 2015 there is a change in gravitational forces.
5,excellent book,"I made my purchase on Amazon.com, and the price was afforded for this book.i enjoy the book, and every Christians should buy this book. The book is a good investment, and I believe that the detail about Mormonism are help to non-mormon."
5,Solid trimmer at a solid price,"I had an older model rechargeable groomsman and every replacement battery I got seemed to be too weak. You can get the replacement battery on Amazon for ~$12, but for a few bucks more you can get this trimmer. I like it better because you can use your own rechargeable batteries that are cheaper. It feels heavier (which is nice) than my older one, and all the old attachments fit this one. If you want to get a battery for the rechargeable model, look at the Wahl website - they are $5 (shipping included). I have ordered that one, and if it works, great I now have one for home and one for travel. If it does not, I have this one and it works fine. (review by Liz's husband, Liz doesnt need a mustache trimmer!)"
3,Wahl Battery Operated Beard and Mustache Trimmer,"I have always used a standard, electric trimmer - the sort you use to cut hair. My old one died recently, and I decided to try this one.First, I'm not delighted with the way it cuts. I have to assume that my disappointment is largely with the change from an electric trimmer to a battery one, but I have no way to validate this. It could be that all battery trimmers have the same downsides.Second, the downsides that I'm not happy about are primarily in how the blades cut. It's a much slower process, and you can expect some pulling. I find I need to slowly make several passes to get a complete trim.While I've heard that these blades could sharpen a bit over time, this seems a bit dubious to me. I'm assuming this is as good as it gets, and that this is just the nature of a small, battery powered trimmer. If I had it to do over, I'd go ahead and get another electric trimmer and avoid the aggravation."
2,The quality's just not there.,I have to agree with the other two reviewers who gave it a 2. I've bought 3 Wahls in my lifetime and this one is the poorest quality of the bunch. Not only are the attachments poorly made but they are also very pointed and scratch my face when I try to use it. Previous trimmers were much more comfortable.
2,16$ trimmer,"To be fair this review starts off by giving the trimmer three stars. It gets one extra star for its low price. Then, it gets one star minus for the fact that three supplied guides all are ridiculously short and are only good if you want that short mustache or beard. If Wahl wants to limit the guides to three lengths, at least distribute them over a larger range. It gets another big star minus because the hairs have a tendency to get stuck in the guides, so it feels like waxing hair by hair without the wax. The sum equals: two stars. Happy shopping."
4,awesome movie,i watch this movie growing up and remembering how good it was. Even watching it today it is still good as it was years ago.
2,Peter Benchley's The Beast DVD,This edition is a poorly edited version of the TV Miniseries. It was edited to be under 2 hours. Avoid this and buy the special edition instead.
1,WHERE IS THE OPTION FOR ZERO STARS?,"Easily the worst POS blu-ray I own. I love this film, but the production quality of this disk is not even fit for VHS. Or shadow puppets. My DVD copy actually looks nicer. Don't Bother."
2,Edited version - very disappointed,"I should have read the viewer comments before I purchased it- as I usually do; however, in this case I was so excited to buy the movie, that I just added it to my cart. This version is the EDITED version and frankly, the movie just isn't that great without the character development.I saw the tv version in its entirety and it was great. However, huge chunks of the movie was taken out to get it to 115 minutes and frankly I don't understand why. I'd rather have paid more for the entire movie than less for the edited version.If anyone finds the entire version, let us die hard BEAST fans know."
5,MIDASUNO RULE!!!!!!!,"My cousin is the new guitarist in this band. He's Chris Morgan and doesn't feature on this album, but the songs are amazing. If Tear wasn't good enough, Start the Riot is good enough to be up there with the great rock songs. I give this 5 stars."
3,Tiki umbrella,I tried this product and it was to heavy for the umbrella. I tried to send it back and UPS wanted to charge $55.00...this is outrageous. So it sits in my garage. I have asked to suggestions but have not received a response. I am open to suggestions.
5,Jack-in-box,"A really lovely version of the traditional jack-in-box, easy turning handle for little hands to control. Wonderful fun to watch your little one jump everytime the horse pops up."
1,Total junk,This jack-in-the-box is total junk. It's flimsy and it broke almost immediately. You turn the handle but the song doesn't play and the pony stays securely inside the box. A great toy if you like watching your young daughter cry. A complete waste of money.
4,A Solid Collection,"I had been searching for a Byrds collection for a while. I already have the reissued Younger Than Yesturday and The Notorious Byrd Brothers, and was looking for something to fill in the gaps.What's so great about this collection is that the later hits presented - Sweetheart of the Rodeo onwards - are the best from that era. I'm also glad that they included ""I See You"" over, say, ""Mr. Spaceman"". Plus, something like this is going to be limited, so it's nice to have something that is on the obscure side."
2,You get what you pay for...,This product lasted for about two weeks before the belt clip became separated from the rest of the sleeve. Buy your case from a local retailer so you can easily inspect and return it if/when it fails.
1,Pure nonsense,"This book demonstrates a complete ignorance of the basic concepts and methods of probability and statistics, as well as what physical sampling is all about. Hard to find a book that contains such a combination of concentrated nonsense and ""of complexes"" arrogance under a single title. I could not understand what kind of a person would write such a nonsense until I reached the chapter titled ""About the Author"". Then, it all became clear!"
1,JUNK!!!!,"Had to give it at least one star...it didn't deserve it though!Could not get it to work with my Nikon D70...battery compartment sucks!! STAY CLEAR...I got as an open box, glade I didn't spring for new!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Solid Kenneth Cole Watch,I saw this watch in Kenneth Cole and had to have it.They did not have one in my size so I searched high and low for it on the internet. Its a great watch and really stylish to. Only problem I had was when it was shipped the watch box it came in was really shattered. I should be lucky it made it with out a scratch. But Amazon is a reliable place to buy things. I buy things from here once a month and never a problem.
3,only for the more advanced yoga practitioner,"While this DVD is a good one, I only gave it three stars because it is definately for the more advanced yoga practioner. She does not show ways to modify the poses and it's nearly impossible to get into most of the poses if you are not already strong and flexible. I've been doing yoga, though not daily, for several years but there were several poses I couldn't even begin to do. I would only recommend this video if you want to take your yoga to a higher, more challenging level."
4,Good Study Guide - Practice exam not included,The book covers all the topics and is a complete study guide but it does not include any practice test for the exam.
5,Vital,"Coming from the network software development area, I decided to change my technical direction 7 month ago; started reading some books about wireless LANs, attended the CWNA class provided by Planet3 Wireless a month later, studied hard using mainly the CWNA Study Guide and then passed the certification test 2 month later.This guide provides a very pragmatic, ""hands-on"" presentation about what you need to know if you want to deal professionally with wireless LANs. The vendor-neutral character of it expresses the spirit of the wireless LAN technology itself. The book, in combination with the very good CWNA class, is vital to pass the CWNA exam. To have it easier at the certification exam (I choked already at the first question big time ;) , but passed anyway), I recommend to also go through books like ""802.11 Wireless Networking"" from Mathew Gast, to get wireless LAN aspects shown from different angles."
2,Sparse sparks,"2 1/2Containing fluid black metal interlaced with a classical sense of Nordic lure, Emperor have elements which help set them apart in these turgid sub-genres but either suffers from ambition or predictability when not finding a rare hard hitting equilibrium."
3,Play-by-Play-Football,"I have just read a book called ""Football"" By Jeff Savage. It talks about the history os football, rules,and the way to get into the NFL. It give examples of historicl football moments. I like this book because the author actually took pictures of the Napa School football team practiceing. It explains all of the rules and how to and how to not break the rules. That is very helpful. I also explains what each position does. So if you are interested in football or just into learning facts this is the book to read."
2,Boring and childish game,"I am 12 years old and i played this game. This game was so short and so boring that 8 months after I got that game, I traded this game,Disney princess,and Strawberry Shortcake: Summertime Adventures for Wall-e on PC. This game would be much better for younger kids."
2,Not good for the person who has lived in France,I found the disapointing especially in the recipes. I experienced a more exciting market and cooking in my apartment in Paris. This book does not do it justice.
5,Great Movie ............ ............. ............. ............. ............. ................ ............... ..............,Great Movie ..... .... ... ........ ..... ... .... ...... ........ ..... ....... ...... ......... ....... ......... ...... ...... ........
5,"Great art, info.","My art students and I love this book. We study the illustrations, styles, techniques, as well as the info. About each character. They have to create a mythological creature and a storyline to go with it. As many Boys as girls use this book for research!"
5,"Buy two -- one for you, one for a friend!","This book is a lovely work of art! A perfect ""coffee table"" book or as an introduction for young people to different cultures and ways of seeing the world, The Book of Goddesses will open your mind and expand your consciousness. ""My house is full of many mansions,"" and ""many roads, one journey,"" come to mind as a way to describe the concepts that unfold as the beautiful artwork and simple text in two pages describes each goddess, where she is from, and what she represents. We cannot understand the world we live in if we continue to dismiss or minimize the cultures in which it is rooted. This may be a ""radical"" concept, but it is an important concept to understand.This book would make a great gift."
3,A brute and a ditz - they deserve each other,"I didn't think this book was very funny at all and I like the author's work. I would have given this book less of a rating except for the fact that I did finish it. Lollie is so inept it was painful and Sam is so mean and verbally abusive to her, calling her stupid all the time, even when he is supposed to be falling in love with her. Except for the fact that he is always there to save her from her ineptitude, this man is a brute and has very little redeeming features. Poor Lollie never seems to improve and her accidents are not very funny. Why these two people wind up together is a mystery. Don't like dumb women, don't like mean-spirited men."
5,Lawn Guyland gets the thrillah it deserves,"This nimbly plotted thriller delivers the goods, genre-wise -- plenty of splashy violence ensues when a gutsy ingenue faces down your basic sinister international conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of government -- but it's the persuasively rendered Long Island milieu and deftly humorous characterizations that stand out. Above all, the heroine's doddering, happily pixilated mom is a rich comic creation who could carry a sequel, or a series, all by herself."
3,"""Venice Underground"" tries to make it above ground!","Decent cast, some action and a so-so story. This movie is great to watch if you live someplace that is cold and gets snow."
2,Ehh.,"I have mixed feelings about this item. It's a great resource tool, when you don't have the internet. When I bought it I didn't realize it was available to listen to (free) on the Yookoso website. Oh well. Still a good product, but I would advise using the website until you think you need the disks all the time."
3,So far so good,"It got use on Xmas day, and that's all so far. It worked OK, not great, but it worked. I couldn't rate this on daily use, I think it might not last a very long time, as it is pretty cheaply made. '3' is a 'not bad, not good' review. I got all the mileage from it I needed as it was my clever 'xmas family card playing day' gift. No-one shuffled on the 25th!"
3,"BROKEN, Fragile, made of thin pieces of wood...","NOT A TOY.I bought this as a collectible for my boyfriend.When I received it, I thought I would check it before wrapping it, as soon as I took the foam piece off, I noticed the figure is a little bigger than my hand.I loved how it looked, but immediately after removing the foam top, I noticed the bicycle was broken in two, but still attached to the doll.It was tightly packed in two foam halves, and it didn't seem to fit that properly.I was super bummed. My boyfriend is a huge Fan.Too bad.Other than it being broken and smaller than I thought - it looked cool.Definitely NOT a toy."
5,Highly Recommend,"My girlfriend who has two boys passed this video on to me and I am so thankful that she did. It was the best gift I received. We are first time parents and of course want to absorb, read and learn everything we can about parenting and ""doing itrght"". I found this video to be very detailed giving parents-to-be an great beginning for their new baby. I have also ordered other videos in this series which I found difficult to find in stores, I have ordered through Amazon.com. This particular video really gets you prepared and offers specific information a first time parent needs to ""get prepared"". I highly recommend this video series! Good Luck!"
3,I really like this book,I think this book is cool! In the book marvin does a big math proplem inclass. He gets it right. The class president said Marvin will probably be the next president. I like that idea!By Tristan
5,Best of the Food Combination Diet Books!,"It's short and sweet!! Of the food combination books that I've purchased, this is the one I shall start using.. Why? Because I found the other books were too restrictive, and I knew that I would eventually give up! You really don't need to know much to be on the food combination diet, just don't mix protein with starch, eat lots of veggies, and fruit by itself. This books keeps it simple and encourages you not to beat yourself over the head if you are not perfect, with no guilt. You don't need to buy a thick book on food combining with fantastic recipes.. just cook the food you like. I've tried the protein diet.. it worked great but I gained ALL the weight right back in 2 months. Good Luck!"
5,Works Great,"I use this to create a little airflow over a ""cold-frame"" type lettuce bed. The growing bed is about 14' long and open on both ends. The blower uses very little power and gives just the right amount of flow to prevent growth of mold while keeping the lettuce cool and happy. I have overhead misters like used in a grocery store produce isle that come on periodically to work with the blower to keep the inside of the bed about 10-15 degrees cooler than it is outside the bed. The blower is very easy to mount and has a round connection for a standard dryer type hose. Good product!"
1,Not worth the time!,"This is not a very well written book, and not really worth the read. I love lesbian romance and this one just seemed to miss the mark. The author does not develop the characters at all, the story line is not believeable and the whole thing just doesn't work. One minute the main character is certain that the object of her desire is straight and just leading her on. The next thing you know, they are both in bed declaring their love for one another. Yikes! There was no developing of the characters to show how this could even be possible. If you enjoy lesbian romance, stick with authors like Radclyffe, Gerri Hill, and Karin Kallmaker."
1,Do not order this CD! It is NOT the CD described on this page!,"I ordered this CD twice, from two different vendors, and in neither case did I receive the CD described here. It is NOT the Japanese import of the tribute to the Carpenters with Janis Siegel, New York Voices, et cetera. Instead, it ia a pleasantly innocuous recording of Carpenters songs played by a ""new age"" style pianist."
3,Toy?,"As was noted by a couple of other people, the fan and heatsinks arrived, and one worked, the other didn't. I sent a note that the part was DOA, and eHobbies said I should go to the mfgr for troubleshooting help. Please. How do you troubleshoot a DC fan? Connect it and it either runs or doesn't run. Which I pointed out in the next email, along with a request for how I went about getting a replacement.At that point, eHobbies stood up and just sent me another heatsink/fan assembly. So it took a few days longer than I initially expected, but the two new motors now have ran cooled heatsinks, which will hopefully keep the motors from overheating.The new motors are high-torque, lower rpm motors, which for my 34 inch long, 20 pound RC motor yacht is ideal. We'll see how well they hold up."
1,Old product,"I ordered two due to the price, but should have known there was a reason for the mark-down. I have used this moisturizer for years, so know how it is supposed to look and smell. Both jars were a dark yellow color and smelled awful. Am going to try to return them."
3,face cream,This cream is good. It does not remove wrinkles or even diminish signs of aging but I like it. It's not too oily or drying. I wear it morning and evening.
5,Caught.....red handed :) ?,"The gloves are very sturdy and attractive. Just wearing them actually makes me feel more confident about my ability to do the physical aspects of my job. I have received several comments/questions about the gloves that I wouldn't have received if they weren't eye catching and well-designed. I would buy another pair of these, without question, and I already plan to do so, for the day, whenever it may come, that these gloves happen to wear out.I highly recommend these gloves and congratulate the manufacturer on a very impressive product that makes my job feel easier and more bearable."
5,Comfortable and functional,"These were purchased for a friend that worked at a grocery store deli. They were used for cold and room temp boxes that had been on pallets or in the freezer. Being used 6 days a week from 6-8+ hours they've lasted a while. They even saved my friend from a nasty cut thumb! The grips do help, but like anything that's being used a lot, it wears. Overall a good buy."
4,great gloves,"i work in a dairy box there good gloves until they get wet im sure alot of people wont be working a wet damp environment so u can probably ignore that, great grip on them and the fit tight! so i can get my hands into tight places i will definitely buy these again when it comes time for new gloves"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this scale before I thought about checking on line reviews, BIG MISTAKE. I paid a lot of money for it thinking it would be great to measure my weight loss. After all it is Weight Watchers brand. IT NEVER WEIGHS THE SAME TWICE. What I mean by this is that I can get on it, step off, and get back on and not get the same reading. And we are talking about pounds different. I tried three times this morning and each time I got a different reading. Again, that is stepping off and on, so I didn't move the scale or do anything different. This product SUCKS."
4,great,cool game very fun and you can take your playing serious too fun things happen even though they can get repetitive
1,A raving nut case,"Actual ""thoughts"" of Audra Lorde. HIV was created by the US army to kill black people. If so its shows once again that you can not trust the Federal goverment to get anything right. Another great thought Cuba and the USSR where just being a homosexual could get yous tossed in nice camp well not that nice were good but the US was bad."
5,The most authoritative and honest book on Frank Zappa,"This book has been around for almost twenty five years now, and this edition picks up the story of Zappa where the last edition left off in 1980. Aside from covering the saga of FZ until his death in 1993, it contains an updated discography, bibliography, videography, list of fan zines as well as a survey of the best websites concerning the man and his music. Despite the fact that this book was originally written 25 years ago, in the opinion of many who listen to and follow the career of this major American composer, it has been deemed the most honest and fresh in its approach"
4,Good price and good product,"The bowls are a good addition to my Garden Party Pfaltzgraff set. The only negative is that they do not have the true Garden Party decor in the bowl, but it really does not matter all that much. A good price for a good product."
4,"Cook's Illustrated, 2006","America's Test Kitchen, associated with Cook's Illustrated, rated this as top out of 12 in November, 2006. Thermos has newer models out now."
3,not quite a winner,I was initially drawn to this product because I liked the idea of being able to drink from all sides. This feature does work but I find you have to tilt the cup up to an uncomfortable level to get the last portion of the drink. The cup is comfortable to hold but very uncomfortable to clean. The inside ridge where the top attaches feels really sharp and cuts in when trying to clean the lower interior of the cup. The cup does not hold as much as it appears. Its capacity pretty much ends at the top of the silver portion of the cup. The rest is taken up by the lid.
4,Miracle Blade,I am pleased with the knife set thus far. I have not had a chance to use every knife. What I have used has been very accceptable. I would recoomned this product. I am thinking of buying another one as a gift.
4,"Don't last forever, but who cares?","I know they say they have a lifetime warranty. I've had 2 sets of these over the last 6-7 years and I'm preparing to buy a 3rd set. For the rediculously low price of these knives, they are much cheaper than having my $400 top name brand knives sharpened ONCE. I think people need to be realistic. One professional grade chef knife (Shun classic for instance) costs as much as 7 sets of these knives.The Miracle Blade III knives are very sharp out of the box. Treated well, they will last for years and stay reasonably sharp. I have not sharpened a knife in ages, and spending my time of chores like that is worth a LOT to me, so I'll keep using my Miracle Blade knives."
5,I love!,I am obsessed with these knives. They are always so sharp and work so well. I've never had to sharpen them. Great product!
3,Knives that stay sharp,admitadly I haven't tried all the articles supplied but I have tried the main knife advertised.I'm a bit dissapointed in the sharpness.
3,Cheap? Yes. Worth $20? Totes.,"Length:: 0:51 MinsEver seen Chef Tony slice effortlessly through a pineapple with the Miracle Blade? Now see a hipster do it in slow motion with a shallow depth of field! The first attempt was ill-aimed, but still demonstrates the (initial) sharpness of the blade. The second attempt slices that fruity bastard clean in half.While this video contains no review, I can tell you this: these blades are quick to dull, rust at the sight of water, and by being mostly serrated, are fatally flawed. But they're hella sharp to start with, and at only $20, they're a great kitchen knife for you and your roommates to ruin. If they dull them out, run them repeatedly through the dishwasher, or breaking them trying to cut their shoes in half, hell, a replacement set is only two Hamiltons. And until their inevitable ruin, they're sharp enough to neatly bisect all the fruit in your house with a flick of your wrist. How can you complain?"
2,Oh Well.,"Well folks, I guess I'm smarter than I thought I was, because there isn't too much in this book that I didn't know, or hadn't read somewhere else. Like a lot of other people in the ever-continuing struggle of self-education,I've done a few courses, and had a few years of hands-on-training, so, unfortunately, it looks like I need to search further afield for a bit more cutting-edge information. I don't mean to discourage those beginners to the ""Iron Game"" from checking this book out though, because Mr Brink sure does know what he's on about. However, if you followed his column in Musclemag as religously as I did, you've probably read most of the book already."
2,Falling: The Story of One Marriage,"This book is supposed to be a ""poignant memoir..' that chronicles the demise of his marriage. While this is beautifully written, I find that John did little more than chronic the mundane day to day activities of one's life. Reading this did not provide insight into his pain, his decision making process, his termoil. If you are interested in a book which creates vivid pictures of individuals, then this is the book for you. I for one did not walk away from this book feeling that I had a ""profound and heartwrenching reading experience."""
5,Shades of Gray,"As a mother who has had to make this difficult choice, I truly appreciated Hennighausen's book on this topic. I only wish that something like this was available when I had to make my decision. The decision to stay home from work to raise my children, on one level was a no-brainer, but on many other levels was the hardest decision I ever had to make. I bought a copy for my oldest daughter (my decision-maker). She is now 22 and will be making the same choices in the future. Thanks, Lynn, for a great book!"
3,WARNING: This movie will make you complicit in a very guilty viewing pleasure.,"Have you ever marvelled at a Meatball Machine, fallen in love with a Robo-Geisha, cheered for the Mutant Girls Squad or even watched slack jawed at the political incorrectness of Vampire Girl Vs Frankenstein Girl? If you answered yes to any of this, then it's just the movie for you.With AV Superstar Sasa Handa leading the cast (I was unsure what AV Superstar meant exactly but 30 minutes in it became pretty clear) this movie prides itself on the amount of exploitation it manages to wrench from its unbeatable comination of a Girls Swim Team + Sasa Handa + Zombies . With a smaller budget than the likes of Meatball Machine or Mutant Girls Squad it does share the same level of unhinged imagination and the burning desire to entertain through an outlandish story told in the most excessive way possible with extra ketchup."
5,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK.,"I thought that this was a good book, but it was not my favorite. Lou is not the same person as she was in the last book."
4,great for starting out,"This was the first aura book I read, and for me, it was excellent. It did a bit of explaining about the technical side of auras, and told a lot of stories of the authors experiences (which dragged on a little bit admittedly), but as for the 'how to see auras' part, it really worked! It was a lot simpler than I had expected, and really very fast. I have since used his basic methods to show my friends how to get started. One warning though - I was expecting to see auras like on the front cover of the book, but what the book actually teaches is how to get *started*, and that means seeing the first 'layer' of the aura, which isn't coloured. It was a first step though, and I felt worth my while. I've been practicing since, and it's great. I definately recommend this book to beginners, it doesn't overload your brain with too much information like some of the others might do."
5,Stablemate saw horses,"These are great saw horses; Simple to use, easy to set up, they stay closed when not in use and are very solid when set up."
1,Not playing by the book,"As a single player, your only option is to play a limit tournament, and since the blinds don't rise, the game can really drag. The no limit tournament isn't really no limit. You still have the $10/$20 (or whatever you choose) or you can go all in. You can't bet just any amount up to all your chips. In the case of someone going all-in, there is no side pot for others who stay in. If the all-in person wins, they win their share of the pot, and all others get back the rest of their bets. Only the winning hand is shown. If you win the hand, you will never know what they really had. Also, if everyone folds, the winning hand is exposed, ruining any bluff. I am disappointed and will be returning mine."
2,Can't pause and game is inflexible,"This game is somewhat entertaining, but it has a few major issues that detract from the fun. The good part is that the game does the tedious stuff like shuffling and counting chips and the hand held controllers display your two hole cards.The main problem I have with this game is that I can't pause it if the phone rings or the pizza driver shows up. If you don't play your hand for 25 seconds, it is folded automatically.Others have noted that the game is inflexible, can go on for a while since the blinds don't rise as players are elminated, and it always displays the winner's hand even if the other players have folded, which definitely affects your willingness to bluff.Finally, in single player mode the computer players are not very good. They play aggressively, so your main strategy should be to wait until you have a good hand and then bet aggressively."
4,True Archeology,"Being an individual who is extemely interested in undersea archeology, I found it to be a fascinating book. Mr. Cussler had a way of making you feel like you were right there or at least watching the various events from a near-by location. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who is interested in TRUE accounts of shipwrecks, treasure hunting, and archeology. You won't be disappointed."
3,This book is not what you think...,"I neglected to buy this book in hardcover because I thought it would be too boring. I picked up the book in paperback last week and found most of it to be just as exciting as Clive's Pitt novels. 90% of the book is fictionalized accounts of how the ships actually sank, mostly civil war type stories. The parts were Clive actual searches for the ships are quite short and really not that thrilling. So I do recommend this book, and if you enjoy the Pitt novels, this one won't disappoint."
4,Passionate and Funny,"I liked the book The Sea Hunters. As I read it, I could really sense Mr. Cussler's passion for history, specifically marine history. At times it became more detailed than I would have liked, but it is very funny as well. I really appreciated the author's irony and sarcasm throughout the book which helped to lighten it up when it got to those detailed sections. My favorite part was all the hilarious stories about what they did when they were in the French port. In the end, it was a good book and I would recommend it, especially for those interested in marine history and shipwrecks."
5,Love having the complete set,Combination of High quality art and religion history.Using it for Religious education classes. Highlyrecommend the entire Art Revelation series.
4,Almost perfect,"This little printer is perfect for trips. It is compact and light. It has a very good resolutions in b&w and in color too. It has two disadvantages, the first one is you can't use any kind of paper (look technical information) and the second is you have to change ink cartdriges for print in color and b&w. But it has a very good characteristic against other portable printers, it can support both 110 or 220 volts, without buying any additional product. As I said, it is perfect for trips, domestic and international."
5,"easy to understand explaination, plenty of screen shots","This book give a detailed and professional intruduction and tutorial of wi-fi standard. no matter whether you want to take the CWAP test or you just want to improve you knowledgement of wireless network, it covers pretty much everything that you need to know. it also provides many screen shots of the real tools which helps the user to understand the concept better.i would highly recommand this book."
5,This book is excellent,"I was in the beta CWAP class last year in Atlanta, enjoyed it - and found it to be very helpfull in understanding Wireless, down to the very roots it is built on. I never conduct anything to do with wireless - without this book by my side to refer to.I have not come across anything related to wireless analysis that I needed to implement that was not discussed or referenced in this book.The knowledge in this book should be added to your wireless toolkit, even if you are not going to be taking the test.Great book!Ranj.Secure-Wireless Ltd.This review was helpful to you.................."
4,The brains behind Bjork,"I'm am a music enthusiast. LFO has to be regonized for their groundbreaking first album's contributions to the electronic music genre, and for their brilliant production techniques for likes of Bjork. Although their work is released on the primarily IDM (intelligent dance music) label Warp Recordings, it should be noted that this is much more listenable cd for the masses then works by the other major artists on the label (aphex twin, plaid, autechre, and squarepusher). ""There's something for everyone"" ; so to speak, some hard hitters, some good cruis'N tunes, one or 2 club bangers, and several tracks to chill out with. Alot of energy on this album, but only gets 4 out of 5, cause theirs not anything as unforgetable as Simon from Sidney."
3,Good for a review~!,This book is not for anyone who is new to IT. If you don't have experience in security and networking then I would say you should say with the sybex bookCompTIA Security+ Study Guide: Exam SY0-101. This book is awesome as a reference but only use this to study if you have been in the field for years. I would not recommend this to new SecAdmin/NetAdmins.
3,Take care,"The book is so good just take care becouse.....the book says ""Include: Learningkey video trainning"" and this is false the book does not have any video."
2,Un Cut Free Disc,"Well,first of all I'm certainly not going to shelve out $45 for a cd that I got free with Un Cut magazine,and this is exactly where i got it.It was given out free some time back with Un Cut Mag.Its a good compilation but nothing special to be honest."
3,Can be very funny but much of the advice is predictable,"Judge Judy is probably more fun to watch than to read. This book, which has the virtue of directness, doesn't go beneath the surface at all in dissecting male-female relationships. With all due allowance for exaggeration and broad humor, I find the image of American men as essentially insensitive, football-watching couch potatoes who leave the toilet seats up to be more of a cliche than anything else.The author's personal stories about her marriages (and her remarriage to the same guy) are fascinating. She has insight into her own life, and she knows how to write. Many young women will probably benefit from reading this and learning the distilled lessons of life. But I can't give this book more than three stars because of the Judge's portrayal of the American man."
4,"Economical, attractive pull",We placed these on the cabinets of our laundry room. Look attractive and were cost-effective. I'm not sure they would be my choice in a kitchen remodel/new build but add a nice (economical) touch in a work room.
4,Good series.,Only complaint is it was slow to load at times. It would occasionally take take 1-2 minutes to start. It would also sometimes stall at the beginning.
5,Yogi Bear is back!,"Well made funny movie! Been a fan of the cartoons while growing up and it's nice to know a new generation of kids will get to know Yogi and Boo Boo now! Surprised they didn't use Yogi's other famous catch phrase ""I'm government properdy!"" though!"
3,"Pretty decent, I was honestly surprised","Yogi Bear is a pretty decent movie. I thought I was going to hate it, but I was surprised. It had some funny parts, which was the main strong point. I wouldn't own this movie, but if it was on TV and there was nothing else on to watch, I might put this on. Pretty decent. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Kids love it!,"Even though it's VERY predictable and follows the formula, kids will be glued to the screen.Another generation will fall in love with Yogi and his loveable sidekick BooBoo!!"
5,Yogi Bear forever,It is a real treat to have a new Yogi Bear feature. Ackroyd and Timberlake do a great job with the voices. Terrific family entertainment!
4,Sweet But............,"This game is alright I mean it has Sting who is my favorite wrestler besides Brock Lesnar,anyway this Mayhem game has only 8 move sets each,and it doesn't have create a wrestler mode,or even 10 additional wrestlers.So you can get this game,but it is only fun for vacations,or if you are only bored."
4,"Totally underrated, yet still awesome","True, this game isn't the best Sonic Game, but It is still one of the best games for Saturn, PC, or Genesis. The Graphics are great, The gameplay is good, sound is AWESOME, and the storyline is more original than any other Sonic game there is!I'd say get this game if you are a hardcore Sonic fan, (like me) or just want to find a good Saturn game. This is totally recommended."
1,Couldn't Fall In Love With This,"I am a big Philosophy fan.I have bought the best facial cleanser ever from them(Purity).I have two other fragrances that I bought scent unsmelled, from them. Amazing Grace is lovely and Pure Grace is tremendous. Get them. Don't buy Falling in Love. It's yucky."
3,Purchased used from an Amazon reseller,"The item arrived promptly and as expected. Discs were slightly scratched, but that is due to the design of the case the product is sold from the manufacturer in which does not properly secure them so they bounced around a bit in it during shipping. Quality was good and I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,Great design but poor execution,"I love the design of this product, but it hardly does its job. I wish it were more functional. I would not recommend this product."
1,A Disaster,"As I come near the end of my journey through Robert Altman films I found many that were excellent, but Nashville from 1975 is by far the worst. I am not a big fan of country music, but I do enjoy Patsy Cline and Willie Nelson. There are a couple of interesting songs in the movie, but most of the music is totally lame. I thought this 160 minute film would never end. It is a train wreck from beginning to end."
2,"Not a masterpiece,for sure.","I bought this DVD a long time ago and didn't watch it,waiting for a fine evening for such a highly rated and praised movie.What a great dissapointment it was! After watching a real masterpiece ""Three women"" and several very good films of Altman, like ""Images"",""McNabe and Mrs.Miller"",""That cold day in the park"", this piece of poor film making has stolen three hours of my time actually spent for nothing!I don't understand so many positive reviews about the movie which simply doesn't deserve this.Those calling it ""a masterpiece"" most probably have never seen real masterpieces on the screen.Otherwise it's very difficult to explain calling this shlock ""a masterpiece"" so easily.Overlong,poorly directed and greatly overated film."
3,some of the worst country western ever?,At some level I felt that the film maker was making fun ofcountry western music. Maybe it was that he had very bad tastein cowboy music?The way be made the people in the movie sick in spiritand in action was the reason I didn't like this movie.It just felt like he was being paid to put across a Republican theme.Keith Carradine's one song seems the exception to the overallbad pick for music.I just was insulted by the movie for all the honestcountry western fans who like good songsthat go back past Gene Autry...
4,Body Butter,I first tried this thanks to my beautician. It really helps dry skin. The small size is great for traveling.
3,Good but I expected more,"The sound is great some fine guitar playing but a bit repetitious.I expected more,if you already have some other music of his wait until you library has it.Really should be a 3 1/2 but can not see how this can be accomplished at amazon. Any help on this part would be appreciated."
2,Many details not relevant for DSLR cameras,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, there are several references to film cameras as well as digital cameras. The recommended settings don't seem consistent with others I've read. He suggests using a ""fast"" shutter speed of 1/150 - other sources typically recommend 1/1000. I wonder if some of these recommendations are more oriented to film.I also don't like some of the ways that he suggests setting up a shot, such as taking an off focus picture of flowers, printing it in a large format, and propping it up to create a background for his ""natural"" hummingbird shots. What's up with that???I have a lot to learn about photographing birds, and I'm sure that much of the guidance is sound. But I can't recommend this book.JoAn"
4,TINY,"This a cute elfin colander a little rough around the edges. But I find I use it a surprising amount washing berries, peas or a bit of quinoa, draining a serving of spaghetti. It seems more for looks, but has its purpose."
3,alright,"The only thing in the pack tht didn't work was the plug for the outlet . Not bad for the money, but I really wanted it for the outlet."
5,the name says it all and for an awesome price,I recommend this if you need a charger and an extra battery the price is really good And everything worked I'm definitely buying from these guys again (:
3,Buy the Generic,"Lotrimin Ultra and its equivalent, Lamasil are overpriced. There are excellent generics out their (e.g., Target) that will save you at least 30%."
3,Not very current...,"This was a good book and gave a lot of technical advice and illustration but it didn't help me as much as I was hoping. It's dated-- now we're having to deal with changes in makeup due to Hi-Def, etc. These are not addressed... nor are many other things that I think are relevant to doing makeup for film/tv in 2007."
3,Great But,Its a great light cord. But I had a big problem trying to figure out which kind of bulb it takes. FYI Nightlight bulbs. Thank god I have a husband who can tell.
3,A Description,"From Back Cover:Her name is Bronwyn, and her fame echoes throughout the land. Barons and swardmasters alike tremble to oppose her will. She is no longer a mere girl.

1,How to start a charter airline,"Beware you guys out there looking for resources on airline charter start ups. Don't be fooled by the title of this book, ""HOW TO START A CHARTER AIRLINE"" is a novel not a charter airline start up resource. There is no editorial or anything else that reveal the nature or the content of this book. The book is a tale of the author's romantic life somewhere in Canada. The author claims to be PhD in philosophy and taught in two colleges in Canada, she apparently ran a small charter company catering to a small village of 200 people.The title of this book is aimed at fooling readers into believing that it is a charter airline resource.This is a scame.The book I bought was appropriately sent to the recycle bin."
4,"Great, but","Jo Beth is at it again. She knows what is best for everyone she meets, but she can't move without a gun. I'm tired of Bubba and ready for him to meet his end one way or the other. Some of what she repeats in each novel is getting stale for those of us who have read each book. Howver, I eagerly look forward to the next bloodhound book."
5,Waited 4 months to get it .... took 1 day to read it!,"I don't understand why Virginia Lanier and her Bloodhound Series is not tearing up the Best Seller list. Had it not been for an intriguing article about the author in the Florida Times Union, I might never have discovered the magic of JoBeth Siddon and her wonderful Bloodhounds. I have read all four books and can't wait for the next one. The author writes the kind of book that makes you not even want to miss one word. Now if she could only write faster!"
4,Good book with un-conventional notations,"This is a good overall book although the notations while consistent were different from most other books. The key part of this book are its problems. The explanations of concepts are sometimes only fully understood after reading through the problems, understanding them and solving them. The difficulty level of the problems varies but for the most part reflect the text in the chapters. The asterisk annotated problems are harder but have a lot of practical significance. The organization and sequence is definitely better than Oppenheim Schafer. Covering Sampling Theorem, DFT,FFT first is definitely easier and provides a solid base to start understanding Z transforms and filter design. So if you are a immune to the notational differences or are ready to take on different notations (some people are not), this is a good book for you."
2,Lame,"Lame movie. Crappy acting, no plot. It denigrates females and makes them all seem like bitchy, one-dimensional people. Definitely a movie for those who don't respect women."
3,Asian WIP Funfest.,"As stated in my other reviews of these films, all WIP flix no matter where produced have the same storyline (read my other reviews for further clarity), only this time out, the women are in competition for a special assignment, but only one gets chosen and, if successful, gets a pardon. Now we`re getting deep here for a WIP flick, so stay close and try to keep up, OK? This film is a bit edgier than the other Switchblade Pictures I`ve reviewed, and it`s not terrible to endure, even enjoyable if you`re a fan - if not, what the hell are you doing here reading my review? The lead actress can act (within reason) and the other inmates aren`t as hideous as those in Roger Corman`s releases from the 70`s, but a WIP flick is a WIP flick, no more, no less. Some less painful than others (again, read my reviews) and this is one of them. If you`re in the choir, let`s run through it one more time, from the top."
3,Mismatch.,"Good quality construction and good design. However, and this is a big however, it doesn't seem to fit the 4th generation 'Shuffle' clip. If you are just going to use this while walking or light exercise, okay, but I wouldn't trust it if you are jogging or cycling."
1,Not for the 4th Generation Ipod Shuffle,"I bought the Ipod Shuffle 4th Generation and this item was recommended through Amazon. The item looks great, however it is NOT for the 4th generation shuffle as advertised. Amazon did accept the item back and issued a full refund. Amazon does need to figure out a way to update their website. Even if I search today for 4th generation armbands, this item appears."
3,Doesn't fit a Shuffle,"Its a shame that this product doesn't fit my Shuffle... I even fished the package out of the trash to double check the picture to make sure it was the same kind of shuffle. Ya, Griffins' patented locking mechanism is useless if you can't put the device in the armband. I ended up breaking the clip and using the thing anyways...."
2,Techies spouse,"I ordered this as a gift, along with a 4G IPod, based on Amazons suggestion. When both arrived I found this armband only fits a 2G IPod and not the 4G. It appears to be a well constructed band but is worthless to me. Amazon, you need to remove this as a suggestion on your 4G ad."
1,Does not fit,This product does not fit the ipod shuffle. It was a terrible buy. I would definantly suggest getting something else.
1,Doesn't work with 4th generation,This product doesn't work with the 4th generation I-pod shuffle. Must have been noted in the fine print. They should have addressed it in the major heading.
5,"Buy it, buy it, buy it!!!",This collection is amazing. There is not one track that does not leave you with a dropped jaw. It's like the best jam/improv sessions ever.Just get it!
5,GREAT FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS.,"Based on all positive reviews I purchased 2 DogBones for my husband and I a while ago. We loved it for reading in bed. Now my father in law that is recovering from a surgery and still is on a hospital bed came to love it too. He complained about the pillows that wouldn't keep his head propped up therefore putting a lot of strain on his neck. That's when we had the luminous idea to get him one. I'm sure he'll be using it when he goes back home as well, because he turned out to be the biggest fan of the DogBone pillow! Well made, won't loose it's shape."
3,weird material,I don't like the material. I would like this item alot more if it were flannel or something softer. Disappointed.
2,Pillow was all polyester.,This particular bone pillow was all polyester fabric and slippery. The others I have purchased had cotton fabric and polyester in the filling. I would not purchase this particular pillow again.
2,"Cute, but uncomfortable","I bought this to see if it would help my sore neck, but alas it did not. It just is not comfortable no matter how I position it. It might be okay while traveling, but I have not tried that. I found it to be too short, and there just is not enough room for my neck between the thicker ends of the bone. My husband did not like it either, so I feel it was a waste of money. It does seem to be well made."
5,Perucki's Neckbone Pillow Review,I like these pillows enough to keep buying them forever. I started using them five years ago. They are great for watching TV from the sofa.
4,Good for sitting... not as good for sleeping,"I got this based on the other reviewers claims of eliminating neck pain, etc... it's great for any occasion when sitting and looking forward are required, and a little string or a small bungee can keep it anchored in a useful place for a car ride, but it's just a bit too thick and firm for my neck when lying down... ends up putting pressure on my 6th or 7th vertebra... it might get better once it's a little more broken it. I would heartily recommend this pillow for anyone with neck discomfort on long car/plane trips, or anyone who just likes to sleep in the car."
1,dissapointed,"I have used the neckbone pillows for years. Every so often when they are not as firm as I would like, I buy a new one to replace it. That is why I purchased this one. Well, apparently they changed the inside filling since I last purchased this product. A fresh marshmellow is more firm than this pillow was. I went back to using my old one because it still offered more support than this new one did."
5,Love!,Thanks for the fast shipment and great price! Very comfortable to use while watching tv and napping in the recliner!
5,best neck pillow for travel and home,"I bought these for myself and my husband after looking at all kinds of neck pillows for use on an an airplane and in a car. We both are dealing with healing neck injuries so I was worried that we would have something that works for our trip and I even bought one U-shaped one just in case. The NeckBones worked much better than those U-shaped types I've tried. My parents also tried them, and are going to get some now. They are a great product, and we also use them while watching TV on the sofa. *A small observance: we got one that has the green and blue paisley and one was evergreen. The paisley one has a little zipper to take out or insert more stuffing; the green one does not. They appear to be made by different makers, but both work just fine."
4,I found what I was looking for,"I finally found a solid color neck bone pillow after searching every website on the net. I ordered two ""just in case"" and guess what...there is inconsistancy in the pillows. One has less stuffing and is not as firm as the other. It was for my husband so he sleeps on the softer one and the firmer one just sits on the floor being a waste of money. But as least we finally found what we were looking for after a long search so I'm not too worried about the loss."
3,Uncomfortable for me,"The pillow itself is reasonably well made, firmly stuffed with polyester material, but for me it is too uncomfortable to use for longer than about 5 minutes. I get horrible neck aches from time to time, and was hoping this pillow would help. It did not. Even when my neck is feeling fine, after using this pillow for a while, my neck muscles start to ache, and it's a relief to go back to regular pillows. The center part of the pillow is about 4 inches in diameter and it feels, to me, that it is pushing my head too far forward. Enough people seem to like it, so I guess it's a matter of me and the pillow not being good together than any fault of the pillow per se."
3,Good for the car.....that's about it.,"I'm an average sized guy, maybe a bit on the shorter side. 5'5'' about 180.I wanted this neck pillow for when i'm sitting in my recliner. Its simply too big of a neck pillow.its equitable to a rolled up towel behind your neck....which is good for a minute or 2, but quickly gets uncomfortable.I should've purchased a U shaped pillow instead....Mistakes were made, and i regret this purchase."
4,Review!,"I spend a lot of time commuting in a van pool and the seats are super uncomfortable. This helps a lot, but the middle part seems a little too thin."
4,Comfortable!,"Comfortable. Been using it mostly as a lower back pillow, don't know about the neck, seems a little too bulky."
2,poor quality,"I bought this to replace a prior dogbone that I had had for many years and it finally wore out. The new dogbone pillow's stuffing is poor quality, and in less than a month's use, it is no longer firm, and is about the same firmness of the one that I used for many years."
4,"Stylish, sturdy, and simple to use","This is a very nice looking piece of equipment and it is very easy to open, put in a notebook HD, and snap shut...NO tiny screws requiring a jeweler's screwdriver. It even has stiff foam padding inside to hold the drive securely in place. Seems very well made. It is a little thicker than others I've seen/owned but is a little narrower too.I think the price is a tad high, but other than that I am very happy with this purchase."
4,AN EXCELLENT LOOK AT OLD HOLLYWOOD.,"An ambitious waitress (Constance Bennett) - who works at the famed Brown Derby restaurant - has aspirations to become an actress, and makes it to the top. Bennett gives an excellent performance as Mary Evans, making her turn from ingenue to hardened star fully believable: she considered this to be her finest performance. As the egotistical, rather decadent film director, Lowell Sherman is fine. This was George Cukor's first big success as well as the first talking picture which took a jaundiced look at Hollywood. As a footnote, this story, which was written by the once-popular Hollywood columnist Adela Rogers St. John was the basis for the three later versions of A STAR IS BORN. It was supposedly based upon the real life of silent star Colleen Moore and her alcoholic producer husband, John McCormick."
2,Disappointed,"""the watch did not meet the high grade expected from this particular brand. It was more basic than giving you the woww effect. The box was of poor quality. It should be velvet black with the silver writing. Presentation is essential always. Not good enough with the white box that gets dirty as soon as you touch it. Better than that!"" The name Kenneth Cole speaks of a certain standard which to me was not meet."
1,Nothing can redeem this game...,"Even as an enormous fan, i find there is no fun to be had with the game, it's frustrating, feel like it's halffinished and doesn't do ANY justice to the franchise it represent, this is like what the league of exrtraordinary gentlemen the movie been to the original graphic novel."
2,Rather thin,I purchased this bed for my service dog so she'd be both clean and comfortable when laying on hard floors. The bed really doesn't have any substantial loft to it so it's just not that comfortable. It's also a pain to have to roll it up and stuff it back into the tight fitting case every time I need to put it away. The strap is pretty tight and doesn't stay slung over my shoulder for the most part (and I'm slender and small). It keeps slipping down.
4,AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT NARCO VIOLENCE,"This is a well documented piece of coverage of the ongoing drug wars currently raging in the streets of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Mr. Rather once again provides fine narrative details of many aspects of the drug wars that continue to reign terror on both sides of the border. It is my hope that documentaries like this make their way into U.S. society so that others will truly know what is brewing down on the border. As a federal law enforcement officer I recommend this product for anyone who thinks they know what is happening on the US/Mexico border. Some of you will be shocked beyond imagination at what you see. And hopefully this documentary and others like it will cause people to react and take action. The people of this nation need to know the situation that U.S. law enforcement faces in dealing with the violent drug traffickers, and this is a very good starting point. Four out of five stars."
5,I am satisfied with my purchase.,I am happy with my purchase of my new scale. It is large scale print and works as promised. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep accurate check of their weight.
4,Fun game and teaches great skills,"We bought this for Christmas in 07 when my son was 2 1/2. He didn't play with it much, but now at 3 years old, he loves this game. He loves the whole Thomas family and this game is his favorite. The manners they teach are good, and my son likes to play along with the characters is acting out the manners or emotions. As for the durability of the disk, not so good. We are on our second disk now. Even with very little handling by my sons, the disk is scratched just enough to not work for some of the games. It shuts off when trying top play. I wish they could find a way to make them more durable for a product for kids and used by kids. I do put the disk in for him, but occasionally he will get a hold of it and I guess it gets scratched easily."
4,Very fun and entertaining,My 2 year old loves this game! The songs are catchy and you won't go crazy with hearing it 5 million times.
2,Too Basic,"I bought this book after taking a very basic class that covered Access. I wanted to use it as a reference tool to remember how to use the features in Access I had learned. Sadly, the book was SO basic, I couldn't review anything I had learned. If you have never used Access, it could help you learn a little- but using the wizards only. If you want to do anything on your own, don't buy this book! It was disappointing."
4,Very convenient and fine for 2+ bikes or a wheel chair AND rolator,Very convenient and fine for 2+ bikes or a wheel chair AND rolator. Needs to be anchored to car rack to compensate for play in the hitch.
1,SL5597 Security lights,"I did not buy these lights via Amazon; they were installed by my electrical contractor. The bulbs are expensive (best price is about $4.50 on the net); they are not energy efficient and no efficient alternative exists; and they are very difficult to change, esp. on a ladder, since you have to remove a lens before you can get to the bulb itself. Whovever designed these bad boys was not thinking, and they never had to change a bulb themselves. Do not buy these lights. My experience with Heath-Zenith is okay--I would get one of the models that handle full size reflector bulbs."
1,Olathe J,"I also purchased this light from Home Depot, but I would not buy another one like it. I really like the idea of the dual bright feature, but this light it not reliable at all. Bulb blow outs, on and off for no reason, and now it has developed an aversion to the rain. I'll replace it in the morning with something a little more reliable."
2,Bad motion sensor,"I installed this light to replace a similar model that took the tube halogeons that had a bad gasket. The main motion sensor no longer works. I can pull up in my car on a cold night and walk in front of it and the light does not turn on. If I walk under the light, in view of the bottom sensor then it comes on. I have a message in with Heath Zenith about this as this light is only 6 months old."
2,Harnoncourt's Big Miss,"The stars of this show are the Vienna Philarmonic and the Arnold Schoenberg Chor. The singers are miscast, their voices being too light for their parts. The worst is Eva Mei, who sounds shrill and tremulous when not singing pianissimo. Despite the claim in the back cover, this is no more ""deeply religious"" than any of the other Verdi Requiem recordings available. A disappointment on almost every count, orchestra and chorus excepted."
1,What a waste!,"Just received my copy. There's no inclusion of the additional commands in file I/O from Verilog 2001. There's no $fscanf, no $fgets. No always @(*) explanation. If you're looking for Verilog 2001 stuff, look elsewhere."
5,Snoopy Rocks,I love Snoopy and this DVD was great. I really like He's a Bully Charlie Brown which is an extra on the DVD. Marcy is so funny when she's teasing Peppermint Patty about Charlie Brown. I also love that Charlie Brown gets to be the hero for once.
5,2.0 4 port Mini Hub,PQ449AAVery happy with the 2.o mini hub. It was rec'd. as promised and perfect side the the limited space I have at my work station.
1,Randomly working hub,"First of all, I'm writing over the second hub that appears in the images.It worked fine for about 1 month, and then started to turn off ramdomly. I know the cost is low but beware of buying this item."
1,Just because it's gnomic doesn't mean it's pithy.,"Gilman plays language games, flaunting her inventiveness with rare and dense compound words such as ""unenskied"" for almost 400 pages. I'm not complaining out of stupidity; I know what ""unenskied"" means. My point is that 400 pages of such language cannot save a book in which nothing new happens. The language, though poetical, weaves an unnecessarily dense thicket around the meager plot to conceal the fact that we've heard this old ""go to the alternate world and save it from the Dark Powers"" story before. Virginia Woolf's language can transcend plotlessness, but Gilman's can't."
5,Moonwise : Like the Wake,"Greer Ilene Gilman is one of the most significant writers in the world today and I hope she gives us something new to follow up to or surpass her wonderful classic ""Moonwise"". We do not go to ""Moonwise"" for plot. We go to it for an experience of language that makes us feel as if the roots of psychic and telluric realities have been laid bare. The book can only be compared to James Joyce's astonishing ""Finnegans Wake"" but unlike the Wake Gilman shifts back and forth from dream conciousness to a more visionary form of conciousness. Long live Greer Ilene Gilman in whose wake the discerning will follow any day!"
3,"Dated, would only recommend to those deeply interested in Africa","The first half of the book wasn't bad, but the tone becomes more strident as one progresses, which is understandable considering the book was written in the mid 60s. Some of the later chapters on trade and front organizations are heavy on statistics and are difficult to slog through, not to mention keeping different factions of trade unions in Cameroon trade unions.The more interesting chapters were why communism appeals to Africans and the history of Soviet and Chinese involvement on the continent.Unless one has a deep interest in left-wing politics in Africa or Sino-Soviet foreign policy, I would recommend skipping this well-researched, but dated book."
2,Where are the Wakefields?,"This book fleshes out the character of Evan and Andy, but I think Liz says maybe two lines and Jessica doesn't say much more. What's up with that? I love Evan and Andy, but lets see them work through their problems with the help of the Wakefield sisters. If you were hoping this book would tell you more about Elizabeth and her neverending love for Conner(or maybe hope that she would help Evan with his problems with some TLC) or to watch Jessica be happy w/Jeremy, then you will be sadly disappointed. You could never read this book and be totally upto date on what's going on in Sweet Valley."
5,Fun gift for New Orleanians,This is the definitive history of the streetcar in New Orleans. It would really be of interest only to New Orleanians as it is filled with arcane data only a native would understand. The book contains many old photographs and route maps. Especially of interest to this native Uptowner were the route maps and history of the Uptown routes and photos of the old streetcars and streetcar barns. My octogenarian parents thoroughly enjoyed this book.The book itself is about 40 years old and a little musty. It would be nice if someone wrote an updated history incorporating the Riverfront line and the re-opening of the Canal Street line.
5,right out of the headlines,"KICKBACK is a galloping good read about a lowly computer programmer caught up in corporate shenanigans that could quite possibly get her in deep, deep trouble.P. M. Terrell has written a not-so-fantastic thriller about very real ethical problems facing everyday people in the workplace.On it's way to being a bestseller!"
5,Good deodorant.,"it can stand the heat and humidity. I like it because so far it has never stained my dress shirts. Another thing is that it is said to have ""no harmful aluminum"".it is expensive but it does the job. Also I have very sensitive skin (SpeedStick and others used to burn my armpits and cause me red patches), but this deodorant is very gentle. I have never felt it burns and my skin feels good."
3,Be aware that this is not fragrance free,"It has a nice, mild smell, but it definitely is not fragrance free. The packaging on the deodorant even says fragrance free. They lied. I have also noticed, which others do not have, a rash. I also tried Anthony Logistics-2.6 oz and it too is not fragrance free. The only alcohol free and fragrance free deodorant which I have ever found that does work is Trader Joe's deodorant (the one in the blue and white package) (and if Amazon sold it I would buy it from them)."
5,New all time favorite? I think so.,"I don't know why it took me so long to buy this album. I've been getting by on just listening to Eradication on the Hails & Horns Magazine Vol 2 sampler cd for about 6 years. I went to their concert last year when they opened for Kataklysm & enjoyed the hell out of that show. I wanted to buy the POE cd then, but they were out of copies. Anyway, this album rules. The visceral screams are fantastic. Some great guitar work as well. I'll be listening to it a lot in the near future & it's sure to become one of my all time favorites."
5,Amazing,"This CD destroys. All Shall Perish have created an amazingly brutal album. This is breakdown driven death metal, the breakdowns are brutal both guitarists do an amazing job. The singer uses a wide range of vocals from hardcore barks, deathmetal screams and even a few black metal shrieks and of course some metal-core style screams.One thing I enjoy is all the songs change pace and sound making each one interesting and never boring. Even with all the breakdowns the songs are often very different. Another plus is the bass is actually audible, you can hear the base in the music and even very distincly in some parts. The drumming is also amazing. Production is spot on very thick heavy guitars and deep bass and douple bass drumming. The vocalist is powerfull and commanding but not overbearing. Well structured and put together songs.If you like death metal chock full of heavy breakdowns and perfect musicianship you will not be dissapointed. My favorite album of the year so far."
4,Systems Requirements Overstated,I play this game on my recently purchased iMac G4 with an 800MHz processor and 512MB of RAM and have not had any problems whatsoever. The box states the requirements are a 1GHz processor. This is an overstatement of the requirements in my opinion. I had a Windows computer with a 1GHz processor and played the PC version and I do not see any difference in the game performances. The MAC version functions very well with an 800MHz processor.
2,"Demo review, be warned","Might be slow. Be warned, I played the Demo on my Power book G4 12 inch (with 1Ghz processor and 1.25GB RAM). It ran fine, just slow. Also, the graphics aren't as good as Warcraft III. I think you would need a G5 to play this and enjoy it, so perhaps this is one for the Hard Core C&C fans out there."
2,Not Accurate,"Agreed with a couple of the other reviews...this scale is not accurate!I have the scale on a flat surface, but when just stepping on it for a weight reading, it fluctuates rapidly WAY over what I wheigh...I have to try to stand perfectly still to get it to settle on a weight, but it is typically 50 pounds over my normal weight. If I step on it 2-4 more times, it will eventually give me a result that is at least in the right area...but I can't trust it at this point.I had no problems with the BF portion of it, other than it is a pain to get down on the floor to push the buttons.It is asthetically pleaseing, but for the cost, I don't think the weight function works right. I intend to return this one."
1,Misleading,I was quite disappointed with this book as I found the title quite misleading. This has nothing to do with 3D animation.
5,Great for dimming nightstand lights,We have a newborn and we cut the red piece to fit over our nightstand lights so we can turn on the light and not have it be so bright. It works great.
5,Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man: A Novel,"This book holds true to Fannie Flagg's talent to capture your attention and emotions. Her southern flair continues to entertain in this book. Daisy Fay's undying optimism in circumstances which appear hopeless is very refreshing and pulls on your heart strings. As with other Fannie Flagg books, I could not put this down."
3,an enjoyable book but not great,"At the beginning of the book, the story is a story of a young girl, which is suitable for kids. Then when the book takes a break and you come back 3 years later the book is definitely not for young children. A lot of girls swear and let boys ""go all the way"" and a girl is even raped by her own father. This book would not shock a lot of teenagers but anybody younger then 13 should not be advised to read this book. The storyline is about a young girl in a broken family and her rise to fame. I really enjoyed this book but I have yet to find out who the ""miracle man"" is. It is a nice light read as well which makes it more fun to read."
1,Bait and Switch,"Loved ""Whistle Stop"" and ""Red Bird Christmas,"" so I assumed ""Daisy Fay"" would be the same reading pleasure from Fanny Flagg. Not! I'm only into about the first quarter of the book and find it a collection of one-liners for a cheap comedy club. I'll give it some more of my time, since it was my blind choice for our book club's selection. I hope there's great improvement!"
1,Antiquated Terms,"Our book club does not recommend WELCOME TO THE WORLD, BABY GIRL! mainly because of poor character development (lead character Dena especially) and what came across as a less than sincere development of what seems to be an anachronistic theme ( words like ""quadroon"" and even ""passing"" seem antiquated) or at least SHOULD be."
4,Abusing Buddha,"I would not recommend this well-written book to folks, who know little of Buddhism, and particularly Tibetan Buddhism. This frightening account shows how a charismatic, but unscrupulous, leader of a spiritual community manipulates her flock to ensure a nice life-style for herself. The book shows how the dynamics of abuse destroy people and lives. A clearer portrait of the evils of a ""cult of personality"" could be hard to find. A good book for those whose loved ones have become enmeshed in a cult and for those who want to learn how spirituality can be used to injure people. The protagonist of this narrative is so ethically obtuse that her actions verge on the idiotic. A case study of a personality that, at best, is narcissistic and, in all likelihood, is that of a psychopath. This is a particularly sad book because the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism can be such a powerful tool towards the good."
5,Enlightening,"IN the last few years I was puzzled when seeing economists cannot agree on basic issues like what caused the crisis and what are the adequate remedies. Keynesian, Monetarist and Austrian schools of thought for example interpret the same facts in different ways to come out with conclusions that are frequently opposite. And nobody admits others may be right.Robert Nelson's book made me understand that the great economists positions are driven by deep values, convictions, models of reasoning and mythical stories which have a religious essence and are embraced with a quasi-religious fervor.This is a great book for whoever wants to take a peak through the veil of mathematical models, statistics and charts of economists' writings."
3,Workable shock,"Replaced some ancient Monroe gas shocks with these. While these have greatly improved the ride and handling, I am not certain they are as good as the Monroes when they were new. The Monroes were a lot heavier and had a larger diameter. The KYBs have a detectable jiggle when extended; the worn out Monroes still had no jiggle. Don't know if the jiggle will actually affect performance, but it makes me wonder. It is really hard to compare shocks without having a number of different brands to test on the same vehicle. I would call these good shocks, but not great."
5,"""Cumpulsive"" ROCKS!!","I was browsing the music selection when I came across a vaguely familiar title: 420. Hmmm...Turns out I had seen the band play at a local bar sometime last summer, and I remembered being mesmerized by Noah's voice. So, I bought the cd, and it is everything that I expected it to be and MORE. These guys can only get better from here! Check out this cd, and if you have the opportunity to see them live, you'll be impressed with their music, as well as their friendly, down-to-earth attitude."
2,Not so great.,"I do NOT find Kelly's voice soothing; in fact, these tapes might be a lot more effective if she'd hire a professional actress to do the voice over. Kelly's diction is amateurish and irritating. The script was unfocused and didn't help me relax at all. However, the music (alone on Side 2) is worth the price of admission... extremely peaceful, slowly shifting chords over a pedal tone, which [...] never fails to lull me to sleep."
3,Print Shop 21 Deluxe,"I did not really like the product, I found that it slowed my computer quite a bit, I don't know what it did but it does not start like the previous versions."
2,Worst Print Shop....save your money til improvements are made.,"Hi, I have used PrintShop since it was first concieved on a dot matrix printer. I recently bought 21 Deluxe upgrading from 20, mainly because 21 said that you could do borderless printing, come to find out, only if your printer supports it. Nonetheless, When I go to print something, it takes about 5 minutes for it to print. It sends a huge file to my HP printer and stands there til its ready to print. Its very annoying as PrintShop 20 never had this issue. I dont see why, in print shop, you cannot change the margins, i cant stand all of my projects having a white border around them. I do love print shop and its ease of use..but they need to work on their programs alot more before they are released."
5,Gates 18898 Heater Hose Mitsubishi Galant,"the truth, is that there is much no to say, has already bought in several occasions the Gate hoses and can say that they work very or, with durability and efficiency and mainly adjusts very or to their place of work in the car."
2,just as good as any other,"The only good thing about this item is the wireless capability that saves you 0.000000000000000000000000008 calories of moving your head down... everytime i weigh myself on this scale, it changes.... sometimes by up to 3 pounds. and thats within seconds of each one... and yes its on a flat hard floor.... its no better than any other scale... dont waste your money"
4,good book...,"I just got done reading this book and I almost cried. No child should have to suffer at the abusive hand of their parent(s). Claudia should've trusted her instincts and told someone right away, instead of waiting to tell her friends and mom. I'm not saying Claudia's not a responsible babysitter, because she is, but she wasn't being very reponsible in this book, especially since young kids were involved."
5,Elements of Mathematics. Theory of Sets,"I am neither qualified nor competent to rate any work of ""Nicolas Bourbaki""; I will ""borrow"" from ""Wikipedia"" about ""Nicolas Bourbaki"" the following information:""Nicolas Bourbaki is the collective pseudonym under which a group of mainly French 20th-century mathematicians wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. With the goal of founding all of mathematics on set theory, the group strove for utmost rigour and generality, creating some new terminology and concepts along the way.While Nicolas Bourbaki is an invented personage, the Bourbaki group is officially known as the Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki (""association of collaborators of Nicolas Bourbaki""), which has an office at the 'cole Normale Sup'rieure in Paris."""
3,Dont trust the straps!!!!!!!,"Pro's Works Good, Good Price.Con's. Do NOT trust the straps!! Use a small bunggi to hold the bike in place. Lost one bike already off the back while driving, the strap broke. We had another strap come undone. If you use a locking pine on your hitch to prevent theft the rack will wobble a lot."
2,They use Europian size,"They had excellent service, but did not indicate Europian sizing, thus the item was too small. By the time I would have paid for shipping both ways it wasn't worth returning."
4,There is life after the Sugababes,"This ex-Sugababe starlet is back to take a jab at a music career. Siobhan was part of the original line-up, until she split from the now-megastar group. However, Revolution In Me is confirmation that her split was due to difference in direction. As the Sugababes developed a more mainstream approach with radio-ready songs, Siobhan works with Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey to deliver sophisticated ( the jaunty ""Nothing But Song"" ), unconventional ( the elaborate ""Man Without Friends"") and urbane tracks. The two lead single are also pleasant, including the dreamy ""Overrated"" and ""Twist Of Fate.""Revolution In Me merges admirably to form a complete piece. Whether it is the sing-along finale ""Iodine"" or the mysterious ""Suasex,"" all the tunes complement each other. Even the weakest track on the album ""Next Human (XY)"" somehow fits the mixture when backing the swift ""As You Like It.""Revolution In Me is definitely a dazzling debut from Siobhan Donaghy."
4,Agreeing with Rory,"As the author, I thank Rory for his thoughtful review.Only one caveat: as long-time readers will know, ""Melvin"" is Rosen's actual name. As another reader pointed out, I must have been thinking of Mad Magazine's ""Melvin Of The Apes."" Both Melvin (Apes) and Rosen yell ""Hoo hah!"" while grabbing their mates. Knowing how a writer's mind works (does the term ""Box o' Junk"" sound technical enough?), I can't protest or deny.The novel is less detailed in areas where the drawn book series is more exacting. Think of the novel as the background story. And ""Where are they now?""And yes, there are plans for collecting the full series."
4,"Wah! He had me at ""A foetus!""","I never heard of the bug snacks when I was in Beijing but they were made famous by travel shows like Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern. Karl no idiot is the first travel host to question the veracity of both the insect buffet and The Great Wall. I am an Overseas Chinese and I too wondered at the fame of the wall. Now that I have seen the China episode, I'm beginning to think that the Great Wall is some ridiculously successful tourist trap that gets millions of people to venture into the middle of nowhere."
4,Karl Pilkington,"Not as great as the Ricky Gervais animated show, but this does have its moments. If you're a Karl Pilkington fan, you'll enjoy his unique perspective on the wonders of the world."
4,Great show,"An Idiot Abroad is a pretty funny show. If you're familiar with the Ricky Gervais radio shows/podcasts, and enjoy them, you'll have a lot to love here. This series focuses on Karl traveling around the world, and the sights look fantastic on blu-ray. Karl is as stupid as ever, but there is still a lot of interesting cultural information being given, typically by the people that Karl interacts with during his travels. As a fan of Ricky, Steve, and Karl, I had a lot of fun watching this.On a side note, this version WILL NOT PLAY in a US Playstation 3. There are several regular blu-ray players that will play it though."
5,Very Best Of Howard Jones,"A good buy,this is part of an Anniversary gift to my lovely wife,along with alot of other 80's music (when we were young!!!!)Exactly as described,nice touch that the tracks can be sampled prior to purchase so you know what you are getting prior to buying,well worth the money.5 stars all the way."
5,Basic Beginner Student,"This books thinks forward and answers questions that the basic unlearned student would ask about Thai grammar. It is an excellent new learner's tool. I highly recommend this book for those who are beginners, intermediate and also advanced. There is something for all and a must have valuable library reference book for the serious Thai language student."
2,Bulky,"I realize that these are cold condition gloves, I just think they're too bulky for being effective work gloves, They're not even very warm."
1,This Book is Filled With Useless Advice,"This is not worth your buy, the book can be read in an hour and is filled with common sense advice, showering, brushing your teeth, etc. This was written for a 13 year old who has absolutely no idea what a woman is or wants. Half the book is about having confidence, again simple common sense that your mother taught you when you were 5. The book was written by a woman who simply does not have the capacity to convey advice to men, it is like her way of telling the male species how stupid we are. My opinion is that the author compiled many different aspects on other confidence building, body language, dating books and put her spin on it. I suggest tyring to find other books that have more meaningful, real life advice. She actually suggests meeting women at Renaissance fairs, NOW, cooking equipment classes, etc. USELESS ADVICE!"
4,Different,This film was one that I can't really describe other than different. I've seen many films in my life and this one grabs and holds onto you while at the same time telling you to get up and leave. I loved it. Buy it or see it!
3,Clockers Revisited and Revisited and Revisited,"Freedomland returns to the world of Clockers and Price presents us with a compelling story, for about 300 pages. But it goes on and on. Thre is no reason for this book to be 546 pages long. I got the point half way through. Clockers was fast and tough and told with a new language. Freedomland is far less sharp."
3,not with a bang but a whimper...,"The first 500 pages of (the paperback version of) this book are almost as good as Price's masterpiece of life (and death) on the mean streets, Clockers. But then something goes awry. Instead of quitting while he is ahead, Price tags on a tedious 150-page denouement seemingly meant to be his answer to Alex Kotlowitz's searing anatomy of the racial divide, The Other Side of the River. I love Price's subject material, his style, and his characters; I only hope his next work is less schizophrenic."
1,"This Book Has No ""Soul""","I've heard a lot about Richard Price. He's a great writer. Good ear. Knows his stuff, etc. etc. And he may be all of these things, have all these capabilities; but this is a downer book. I picked it up, read the first fifty pages, glanced at some middle parts and read the ending and put it down as a waste of time. Noir all the way. Conventional characters. Depressing - nay, deadly, locale. And in the end it gets you absolutely nowhere. Nothing there at all."
2,Dull Book by a Good Writer,"This was a slog, which I avoided by skimming after the first hundred pages. Too bad, because the writing is sound, and the characters almost came to life. Why do so many books have to be about dead kids, missing kids, abused kids? Obviously it's a powerful device to get most readers hooked, but I'm wearing out on the formula. Something fresh please."
1,Generic!,My husband is a superman and I'm looking for help. This just doesn't offer any new insights. I keep waiting for someone to offer up some 'help'.
5,Essential and Classic,"This book is amazing. Can't believe it was written in 1974. The concept works very well today, even for web and interactive design. I have learned much from this book."
2,Unmemorable,"I read this trilogy ages ago when I was a kid and the fact that I remember so little shows that it was nothing special. Many others have said that the writing style is very ordinary and this is true in that it did not stand out at all. There was some interest in the plot, but in this second book, I do not even remember a single interesting event, and I have a fairly good memory. I guess having read it as a kid means the plot could be interesting to kids but not necessarily adults.If you are a Forgotten Realms fan (which I'm not, I was given the books) then the added interest of this as a background story as well as connections to the world of the Realms will probably outweight the negative aspects of the book such that it may be worth reading. Otherwise, it's fairly pointless."
5,A MUST for IT professionals!,"""Ace the IT Resume"" is the best resume book I have come across that is specific to the IT industry. I am graduating from college in a few weeks and this book has really helped me with my resume and portfolio. This book is for ANYONE in the IT field. Whether you are a recent college grad or someone looking to move up the ladder. It has numerous examples of all different resumes according to job title. Also, check out the 2nd book in the series called ""Ace the IT Job Interview."" It is another great way to help you find the job and GET the job!"
3,5th grader reader,I read book Jeremy thatcher dragon Hatcher.It is about...A boy that buys a dragon egg. then the egg will hatch.It starts to get bigger and bigger.Mary Lou tries to kiss Jeremy.Jeremy went to the library to look up dragons.He named the dragon Tiamat. The dragon got too big so he had to put it in a barn that had no people. I don't like this book because it is sad.
5,The Best For a Dragon Lover,"I have always loved dragons and other fantasy creatures, but my favorite is the dragon. This book is a very,very,very good book and it's my third favorite book.I first heard about this book when I was in art class and our art teacher would play this audio cassette. i loved it when I first heard it because it is GREAT because of the imagination thet Bruce Coville has.In this book there is a sense of magic at every full moon, and a sense of sadness at the end of the bookGood Book!"
5,This book is a great book.,This story is about a little boy that bought an egg from a magic shop. For a while he took care of the egg.When the egg hatched he was suprised.He cared for the dragonut until she was to big and had to go to the other world. You will have to buy the book to find out what happens next.
2,Cheap and flimsy,"When the glasses arrived I immediately set them on the marble counter to see how balanced they were, and one was off - even after filling it with water, not stable at all. They are pretty, but that's about it. When the glass is about one-fourth full, it is very easy to knock over. I was very disappointed in these. I finally ended up with some lovely, robust stainless steel wine glasses - they were more expensive, but you get what you pay for! I just threw them into a sack with some other junk plasticware and stored them in the hall closet. Yuck."
4,I love this one,"I adore this book. I find it absolutely enthralling.I love the quiet poetry, the calm illustrations, the strange details (flying sail boats? A sand fish (that looks like a cat on the side) that comes to life?) - everything.Unfortunately, my nieces (5 and 2.5) don't love it quite as much as I do. Maybe they'll grow into it? I suspect they find it somewhat lacking in story."
3,Interesting,I found this book to be average overall. It didnt really grab me. I thought the plot and the story were good but thats about it.
5,Item was exactly as described,Very straight forward. Item was exactly as described. Easily installed. Probably would look best with a license plate frame surrounding it.
1,Do not buy this product!,The TV performs perfectly until the optical block fails then you are in for a very expensive repair bill. Google Sony Optical Block and you will find a lot of unhappy Sony customers.
5,Excellent pens!,"These pens write very smoothly, gliding across paper, and make clear, black lines. I've never had one leak or break. They last a very long time - about three months each in my case. Definitely good stuff!"
2,Leakers,I have used 5 pens so far and 2 leaked so when I opened the cap ink got all over my fingers.
1,plodding entertainment,"X flies suffers from its target audience. Is it really unable to break away from the plodding entertainment that masquerades as clever film for stupid people?I have never understood the US style of entertainment, pandering to the lowest, geekiest, common denominator.But the lighting is fantastic"
3,didn't stop my water hammer.....,"These hammers usually work and they are so easy to install. They go after the turn-off valve, in between the 3/8 flex hose that goes to the fixture. Unfortunately this did not stop my water hammer caused by my toilet."
2,Moved problem,Product was easy to install and I will say that it stopped my pipes from bagging.Now the problem is the arrestor makes alot of noise. Basically it just moved my problem from the pipes to the arrestor.
2,The Blessings of Love,I expected more. I've never read all the daily meditations. I've only read a few of the pages. I expected something more than just a few words on paper.
2,Legends...,"Many of the kids that listen to hip hop today, might not even know who House of Pain (HOP) was. Unfortunately, this effort will not motivate them to know what a revolutionary hip hop band they were. The content is fine and it's great to hear these jams resurface. But what about jams like ""Legends"", ""Fed Up"", ""The Have Nots"", ""X-Files"", ""Back from the Dead"", and ""Runnin' up on Ya"". Because all of these songs and many others are not on this album, the title is definitely not fitting. The same goes for Everlast. From the album cover to the choice of songs, this album falls short of representing what HOP and Everlast have given to the hip hop game. Sadly, someone approved to make this item public before putting together a worthy compilation."
4,Awesome,"This is an awesome, not just in the way it looks, but the triple jets are really cool and light anything you put near em. I do have some concerns though. Some times it just will not light, so I turn the gas up and down and it'll usually do the trick, and it won't really work upside down for that long like many other jet lighters, but that's a small quarrel. I would and have already suggested it to friends. you should buy it."
3,Great for Potty Training,"Great for potty training, however the size is irregular. I am sure my child will grow with them in the future."
2,Ridiculously large,"Bought these for my daughter for potty training, over training pants. She's 30 lbs and the 2t are HUGE. I think I could wear them. I put her shorts over them and she complained that the bunching at the waist was ""ouchy."" She cried for a bit, and even after settling down she walked funny - clearly the bunching was annoying her. they're also very noisy. I like that they're PEVA, but I don't know if they're going to work out. I know people say to buy small, but she has Beyonce thighs so I'm not sure that's viable. The elastic legs and waist aren't large - just too much material all around."
3,"Not especially durable, sizing is somewhat confusing","I was somewhat confused by the sizing because 24-28 lb. is 18 months in plastic pants and 2T in Gerber training pants. So I got both of those for an 18-month-old who is tall and thin and they fit pretty well. Those training pants go up higher on the top and down lower on the bottom than these plastic pants so you have to tuck the training pants in or they will leach wetness out. These plastic pants aren't especially durable. They get tears in them from normal wear and tear after a couple of months. That may not be a problem if you have a baby who you can potty-train fast, but mine is hardly talking and very fussy, so communication with her is kind of tough and it's taking a while."
5,Comfortable to wear,I like these comfortable and very durable rings. This is my second one and is due to my fingers swelling so I needed a larger size. I have had the first one about 3 years now.
3,Easily to scratch,"This ring is very light weight, and fast shipping. However, it is so easy to scratch. I just got it today, and got some scratch on it for wearing within 3 hours."
2,Disappointment,"When the description of this tape included the word ""cloth,"" I was expecting the traditional cloth adhesive tape. I was very disappointed in this tape. First of all, it was made of some flimsy material. Definitely not the traditional cloth bandage. Secondly, the adhesive was very poor. Couldn't get the ends of the tape to stay down. The tape was a waste of money."
2,Printshop 21 Pro Photo,This program is not as user friendly as the older Printshop Photo Pro for Win 95/98. I really preferred the older program. Maybe I'm just resistant to change.The photo edit portion of the program doesn't have some of the functions of the older version.
1,If there was a 0,If there was a zero i would have rated it below .Please don't make my mistake and download this.If you do you will get more than you bargain for and zero support to get it out of your computer .Take my advice and buy corel.I will never buy another printshop program.
1,"Bad, horrid, and awful","Fans of the ""Dragonlance"" saga will want to skip this one. It's set in the world of Krynn, but everything else is off, probably because the stupendous team of Weiss/Hickman wasn't involved in it. Instead, we have Krynn writer-wannabes who didn't even bother to do their research. JUSTARIUS, Head of the Order of the Red Robes, is referred to as ""justinius"" here, and that's only one mistake. Don't waste your time."
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY","I read all the reviews before we bought this, but thought to myself for the price how bad could it be. I now know the answer to that question. It can be very bad. We don't have any other video game systems in the house so I thought this would be a nice introduction for my 3yr old. I was mistaken. My daughter played for about 5mins and then was done. The games just did not hold her attention.And the graphics.... I've played every video game system from the Atari, Intelivison days to until now and I have NEVER SEEN anything that looks as bad as this and we only have a 27in TV. I would hate to see this on some of the larger screens.I don't know what they were thinking with this product, but it is not worth the money no matter how cheap it is."
1,I don't like it,"We got this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, hoping to get her started on learning with some fun. To me, this thing is VERY difficult to use for a 3-4 year old, heck I have some trouble and I can play PS2 games. Maybe over time my daughter and I can make it work, but a few more hours of frustration (and horrible graphics) may make this paper weight."
3,Not bad if you get a good deal on it....,"The graphics are very 'old school' but it is fun for a little while at a time. My son JUST turned three and isnt too impressed with it yet. He has a hard time manipulating the pencil and pushing the button at the same time, but I just put it away for a few weeks and will pull it back out and try again."
5,"The Magic of ""The Earth Adventure""","""The Earth Adventure"" opens a whole new world of possibilities understanding our journey through life. I recommend it to anyone who is hungry for spiritual wisdom."
5,A Lost In Space Die-Hard's Delight!,"The ORIGINAL music is obviously the best, and that's exactly what this is. You can recall Dr. Smith's greed: ""... every last Diamond in that hill!"" Or Penny's cry: ""Mr Nobody?!"" So many soundtrack CD's are not up to par; not what we remember. This IS what we remember. Thanks to Kevin Burns for salvaging those master recordings and letting fans share in this important piece of television history."
5,Wonderful Orchestrations,These soundtracks make you feel like you are a part of what's happening in the series. They dont make them like they used to.
3,More for South Tahoe than North Tahoe,"This guide should be renamed ""Day Hikes Around South Lake Tahoe."" Out of the 21 hikes, only 5 of them are around the North Shore and 3 on the Nevada side of the lake. The rest are all around Emerald Bay and South Lake Tahoe. Aside from this disappointment, each day hike has easy to follow directions and maps."
1,a big disappointment,I had the worst experience. I paid for the book and have not received anything. I am extremely unhappy. I do not recommend to anyone buying in this site.
2,Sub-par Sound for a 1976 Recording,"This is a very poor sounding recording, especially for the price and the date of its recording. This was my first experience with La Favorita. I can dimly perceive that it's a very powerful opera so I have no quibble with the work itself, but the recording is bad enough that I likely won't be giving it much attention in the future. I would expect this from some of the other sneaky budget labels who hide cruddy recordings behind big names, but I didn't expect it here. Live and learn."
2,Defective Watch,"The Kenneth Cole watchI that was sent to me was defective.There is a good sized scratch under the face that is very noticeable.Whoever was the one who packaged this item must be blind or dumb because you could easily see the scratch under the face and the scratches on the edges of the watch.I highly recommend anyone who buys a watch from Amazon does not buy if it is coming from Watchzone or [...].I called their customer service line and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.When I finally spoke with someone they told me that the only option I had was to send the watch back or get my money back because that was the last of that item.I know that is a lie because the watch is still being sold on Amazon.If this was the last of this watch sold by them they should have at least given me a discount and informed me prior to, of it being defective."
5,Great,Fits my s+w 4006 shorty forty perfectly. Looks like its made very well. I am 6' and 245 and it fits very well. Gets rid of bulge on your hip and tucks the pistol and clips under your armpits were there much more hidden. Ex cop retired
2,Motion sensor SL-5316-WHC,Was a christmas present. He said something didn't work right. I think it was one of the level settings he wanted to set.
3,Switches on Randomly,"I had the identical experience to ML. A similar Heath unit worked beautifully for about 4 years, but burned out.The replacement, bought at Home Depot in about 2008 is very erratic. Slower to activate, and cycles on and off for no good reason. It is mounted in an ideal location (including no breeze) where there were no problems before.The cycling on and off is not constant, but it's enough to annoy and waste energy each day.Zenith/Heath seems to be the only game in town. For this product: buy local, save your receipt and return bad units to the store. 10 year warranty (have to give them credit for that).I just got aHeath Zenith SL-5411-WH 150-Degree Motion-Sensing Twin Flood Security Light, Whiteat Home Depot. (bundled with spotlights). Sensor looks identical, but it allows Compact Fluorescent bulbs, and so far it works perfectly."
2,Disappointed,"This one didn't do it for me at all. I purchased it because of the reviews here, but was deeply disappointed. ""Affair"" just didn't measure up. True, it's a page turner, because I kept hoping the story would explode on the next page, or the next. But for me, it just fizzled out."
5,WOW,One word Wow! Mrs. Brown did an amazing job with this book. I just want to tell people it's a must read.
3,would not recomend,"ive had these in my truck for about a year now and i wish i would have gone with a different route. they are molded but not very well. i have a 6 speed truck and there is a huge spot where the mat is bluged away from the center console and all kinds of debris can get under the mats.the mats are held in place by 3 locaters on each side. (driver and passanger) they are basicly short pointy screws that screw into the carpet and the mat clicks on to these. The mats often pull off of these and shift under your feet...not cool.Ive recently had several of those screw pull out of the carpet leaving 1/4"" sized holes in my carpet...I would stay far far away from these, not worth the money!"
4,Extremely listenable,"I'd say this is the best Guster album, with an overall listenable quality, a few stand-outs being ""Happier,"" ""Either way,"" ""Two Points for Honesty,"" and ""Fa Fa."" But ""Barrel of a Gun,"" ""Center of Attention,"" and ""All the Way up to Heaven"" sort of spoil the whole mood. They're fun and nice, but not quite up to the rest of the songs on the album, which is why I'm giving it a four.But it's nice, because there ARE stand-outs, as opposed to ""Keep It Together,"" which was sort of disappointing in that aspect."
5,"love at first listen, unconditional love thereafter","wait i think i found a tear in my eye to show the appreciation that i have for guster and everyone who bought this cd. i can play this anywhere (at work in, the car) and all the time and i never get sick of it. the percussion and soft vocals make this album and guster unique and sets them apart from every other band in the world. they are not christian rock but the lyrics might imply it. overall they are winners in my mind!!"
1,Poor Alternative To Husky Liner,"I'm the type who tries hard to protect the interior of my cars and trucks. I've previously used Husky products extensively, but I thought the Nifty product looked like a good alternative. My first impression was that I thought the material was pretty flimsy. The fit was good, although they didn't cover as much of an area as my fitted Husky's had in other cars previously. The underside of the mats are smooth, so to keep the mats from sliding around, you use a post that screws into the carpet and snaps into the mat. So far the portion of the tab that screws into the floor has worked alright, but the portion that snaps into the mat does not hold. Everytime I adjust my position in the seat and step onto the mat the mat snaps loose and slides up under the pedals. I'm trying to decide whether or not I can live with the mats, but it's not looking good. On a positive note, the 'plastic' material has held up well enough."
3,Good read......,"While I am older than the author, I grew up in the same neighborhood and recognize most all of the schools, landmarks, etc he mentions. That was the fun part of the book for me but it could have been better. I read in the introduction his desire to change, or ""obscure"" some references, but why write a book on your childhood and not just come out with the streets you lived on? He never states them. He went to a college in western Michigan in a cornfield? Why not just say you went to Grand Valley? (I think). I went to Denby and Wayne State, see how easy that was? I didnt enjoy his references to other literary works, that bored me. Whatever one thinks of Coleman Young, his quotes in this book are for real. He did say those things. Lastly, one could agrue that the racists left the city beginning in the late 60's, not in 90's like the author. He is what he is, it's not for us to tell him if he is or not."
2,Too weak for large binoculars,"Fits as advertised to my Celestron Binoculars and to my tripod. However, once set up the slightest touch causes severe springy side to side vibration. This product shoud be made out of metal instead of plastic."
4,Hilarious and Witty,"This book is perfect for all W.C. lovers. The absurd detective plot and a journy across the country from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in an old Cadillac are the backdrop for W.C. Fields' amusing one-liners of wit and wisdom. And the old, alcohol soaked comedian fires them in abundance. I couldn't help myself but laugh out loud. Good entertainment!"
5,You'll really enjoy this,"This is really good. If you like Civil War dramas, you will enjoy this. I understand Campbell Scott is a fan of Ambrose Bierce's work - it shows in terms of his characterization. He's perfect as Ambrose Bierce. Even if you're not familiar with any of Bierce's work, you can thoroughly enjoy this piece. The production values are excellent, and the rest of the cast turns in solid performances too. Outstanding entertainment!"
4,Good Treatment of novel short stories.,"When I rented the DVD I did not know what to expect. The subject matter interested me, and on viewing the movie I was delighted. I had seen one of the three, Occurrance at Owl Creek Bridge, in adapted form on the Twilight Zone or some other series. The other two stories are in hindsight true to the original short stories, which I have since read.The stories within a story treatment was novel but allows the viewer to get to know the author a bit and his motivation. The ending where Bierce agrees to continue his employment with Hearst on his terms, is ironic due to his firm anti-war stance and Hearst's future role in plunging the US into the folly of the Spanish American War. I wonder if a crisis of conscience over his role in formenting that fiasco, did not lead Beirce to revolutionary Mexico and his subsequent disappearance."
5,beautiful!,The bracelets look more beautiful than in the picture! The crystals are just great! And the package is wonderful! 5 stars from me
5,Excellent book about NYC!!!,This book is great! It's got so much information and so many great photographs. I'm really excited to read it with my students who are learning about NYC this year!
4,5 weeks later and so far so good,"I agree with posts that it attracts deer, as one day after putting up the stakes, I had 3 inspecting the area. I couldn't see if they got shocked or not, but it's been 5 weeks now and haven't seen any since. Whether it's the fact they got scared or not, it seems to be keeping them away. Not only helps for garden damage, but great to keep them away from bringing deer ticks into your yard. One thing to note was the cotton balls they provide have to be broken apart to fit inside the top of the stake hole. Directions show to just shove a full one inside, but it won't fit."
2,The deer didn't care!,"I set this up near my barn,and alas the deer seemed to ignore it's effect.They still frequent the proximity of these stakes. I have tried everything,now I will feed the deer,and give up on the garden!"
1,"Started well, ended poorly","The beginning was captivating and engrossing. Unfortunately, it soon turned into Psycho Sorority Queen on a Rampage. It's almost like Siddons asked Stephen King to finish the book."
2,Not for me,"I usually enjoy Anne River Siddons, but this book just left me unsatisfied. I thought the twist at the ending was just silly (with Paul and Fig). I have to say this is my least favorite of Siddons' books so far."
3,popular and non-profound,"This is a ""popular"" account and not very profound. Clearly the Templars were not guilty, but the forced confessions may have misled the Church authorities. It is a sad story. In fact its recounting of the Crusades added little to my knowledge, but the couple chapters on Philip the Fair's destruction of the order were informative, as was the information on the structure of the order."
1,VERY Sticky :(,"The grip is VERY VERY Sticky. I had a very hard time to shift my hand position from forehand to backhand (or the opposite way). I can see why some people really like this grip -- because their hands sweat a lot so they can not hold racket. well, I can tell you that: With this grip, you will never lose your racket from your hand.... because it will STICK on your hand!! my hand hurts after 30 mins....But I do have to say, if your hands really sweat a lot, than you might want to consider this grip or maybe some towel grip. I've had one before this one, it's really comfortable :)"
2,not a must see,"To me, the characters of this film were more ""type"" than genuine---created simply for a trendy variety. None of them seemed fully developed and all were dysfunctional to the point of annoyance. Their respective maladies appeared to be the movie's grounding. How long would any real person put up with them as friends? One ""happy"" couple finally emerged but their joinder felt merely pro forma---there was little plot developemnt of their relationship or chemistry between them. Less than a must see."
1,"don't buy this, it will stop working anytime.","bought this before 6+ months, and today it just stopped working or to be fair, the right head stopped suddenly while in the middle of my sport session that even made me mad as hell. do not buy this garbage, look for anything else at least with quality."
1,Change out the notebook adaptor card for a version 3,"that's what the Linksys tech guy told me over the phone. He was really helpful running throught the product and troubleshooting everything- and this was 10PM Sunday night. A+ on tech support.The install on my main- wired- XP box was an absolute snap. The install to the win2000 laptop went fine until I tried to connect to the internet- it found the router but no internet.When the tech guy told me that I needed to swap out the cards I told him that this was a packaged system and I doubt the vendor would just ""swap out"" a packeaged card. I'll find out later on today.But- to date- if your running the platforms I mentioned above, you will not get internet access on your laptop with the version 4 card."
2,Obsolete technology,"Linksys makes a good product, but 802.11b is several years out of date. For the same price as this router you can get an 802.11g which is much faster, has better range and will be more reliable."
5,EASY-EVEN FOR ME,"INSTRUCTIONS WERE QUITE GOOD BUT FOLLOWING THE STEP BY STEP GUIDE I COULD NOT GET THE THING WORKING,WENT ON LINKSYS WEBSITE AND CLICKED ON LIVECHAT,AFTER ABOUT 3 MINUTES OF WAITING FOR AN AVAILABLE HELPER IT TOOK THEM ABOUT 1 MINUTE TO GIVE ME INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET IT ALL WORKING,HAS WORKED GREAT EVER SINCE,WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE-LINKSYS LIVE HELP IS FREE BY THE WAY"
4,what a book,"Lewis would have laughed at the size of the book, but god at the great memories. He was a good Bull Dawg Fan!"
4,As advertised,The product was exactly as advertised and was exactly what I wanted. It was delivered as promised and in excellent condition.
2,"Alright, but not great","I bought this game and I returned it the next day, not because I disliked it, but because I had already beaten it. It is a very simple game that plays much like Crash Bandicoot for Playstation. I wouldn't recomend it to buy for advanced gamers, but if your bored one day you could rent it. The excellent animation on Donald and the incredible amount of detail in the backgrouds makes this game more like a cartoon than a video game. Even if you get everything in the game it will only take about 6 hours to beat. I would, however, recomend it to younger, less experienced gamers because of its simple gameplay."
4,"The story of a beautiful princess on a ""bad hair day"".","A charming tale of kings, castles, fairies and princesses. Because of a badly-worded magic spell, the Princess Melisande finds that her hair is growing faster than she can cut it. And things go from bad to worse when her well-meaning boyfriend tries to help! (This guy has a gift for half-baked lateral thinking.) All of a sudden its no longer the princess' hair that's growing - it's the princess herself"
2,disappointing toy and a mediocre book,"This is a very odd little item. I should have known better than to buy something with no picture.If you are familiar with the Jellabies, you know they are six soft rainbow-makers made of jelly or jell-o or something similar. The first problem with this item is that the little stuffed Amber doll is made of no special material to simulate the creatures' special makeup. Secondly, the doll is permanently attached to the little book. Thirdly, the Jellabies have very cute little noses, but this doll's nose is a big round plop of a thing, which does not help evoke the character.The book, ten pages and in color, is about Amber's journey (in her signature hot air balloon) to get to Strum's birthday party.The Jellabies are pretty cute, and it is difficult to find tie-in merchandise. If your child loves these characters and you are desperate for something, this would be okay, but you'd be better served to get the lift-the-flap book also available."
1,Horrible Horrible HORRIBLE!,"When I received this camera, I understood it had been used previously. What I did not expect was to find battery erosion in the battery compartment. I also did not get the memory card as promised. I'm highly dissatisfied."
5,Easy cheesy breezy,"The Easy Share line is a great gift, and it eliminates the confusing uploading/downloading/cable-hooks-up-where? for those PC & digital photo newbies. I have purchased 4 of the EasyShare line for gifts for family, friends and myself."
5,Simple Easy and Great Value,"This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased. I cannot overstate how easy it is to use this camera and all of the features it offers.Its does not run through batteries, it takes crisp pictures and easily fits in your pocket if you need to carry it on you.I have found that the menu's on the camera make it easy for you to see what you are doing and is not confusing, each mode that you chose gives you a brief description of how you would use each picture mode and makes this camera simple to use.The only interesting thing I have learned from using this camera is with night pictures and by the way it does an excellent job. You have to hold the camera very very still otherwise the night images turn out blurry. I believe the shutter stays open a bit longer during night pictures which would make sense.If you are unsure of what camera to own stop here and buy this one now belive me you will have no regrets."
5,Great camera at a great price!,"I needed an easy to use camera that would take great pictures, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This camera meets all of those requirements. The pictures look great, it is easy to use, and the software that comes with this camera makes it very easy to transfer pictures between the camera and my computer. The included software also makes it very easy to create online photo albums to share your pictures with friends and family. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for an affordable camera that takes great pictures."
2,great deal for $25,Takes OK pictures. Fair amount of noise. Not a big fan of the interface (clunky and non-intuitive). Slow to turn on and shut off. Macro setting not great. But for $25 I'm totally satisfied/
2,Not the Best,"I have had this scale for 2 years and I haven't had the problems others have had with the battery failing. It is nice looking and I suppose it is ok if you weigh yourself once a month or so. But, if you are dieting and weigh yourself everyday it will dissapoint. It is inconsistent, off by 2-5 lbs. Some days when I weighed I was so dissapointed because it appeared I had gained 3 lbs in one day! So now I just use it occasionally and don't totally rely on it. I use the scale at the gym if I want accuracy."
2,Good but has serious error,"The update is in serious need of updating. It contains a lot of superfluous information. Omit some of the junk and add a little more science and the book would be great. One major error is his discussion on the CFC's (refrigerants), his conclusions about our lives being threatened by the changes to CFC's is blatantly false. Good for a middle schooler but the book is not high school quality."
2,"Great Science, Not Great History","Unfortunately, Wile repeats the same silly lies - the made-up history that Galileo was horribly mistreated by a mean, Catholic Church. (In fact, it was the Church which defended Galileo against the protestants, who were horrified at his theories. And no, Galileo never proved his ideas about the earth's rotation. He enjoyed the Church's money and protection, even after being rebuked for stating his theories should be accepted as fact until proven false.) Hope Wile's books can be corrected, so they can be enjoyed for excellence in scientific and historical analysis."
2,Disappointed,"Not overly impressed with this book. Contains too few recipes and too much frivolous info. Do I really care about the history of smoothies?? No, I just want good recipes, and this book contains too few of those."
2,A bit boring...,"Why are Test Tube Aliens such a hit with thye kids? When you recieve the alien, it's a tube with this mush in it. Add water and it's ""food"", and then just watch it. When the lights blink, it's telling you it needs something (water, food, etc.). After that, it just sits there, blinking, blinking, blinking....It's been sitting on my sons shelf for six weeks...blinking...Boring!"
5,Big Franks,"For a Meatless hot dog I have always prefered Big franks over the others because of there smokie flavor and they size of them, they are ' Big franks' I choose Low Fat- over the Reg. ones just because of calories. But if that is not a concern go for the Reg. ones- Yumm"
2,Cost,These go up big in price every time you order. Better to find other brands of food. There is no good reason but greed.
3,"Good, but not club classics","Well, this is a pretty good cd set. But, I am from southern california, and honestly, I have heard maybe one or two songs at the clubs. Now, I understand this is a global community and maybe these are club themes in other countries or regions in the US. Good CDs, but bad title if you live in So Cal."
3,Girl is pretty but plot is kinda stupid,"The actress is very beautiful and I like her a lot. But the story is ... I have to say, stupid."
4,Great Movie,"I really liked this movie. I've watched it three times already and enjoy it each time. It's based on a true story of a girl who moved to Cuba with her family prior to the revolution. The story, dancing, and music make this movie a hit. Diego Luna and Romola Garai have great chemistry. I enjoyed this movie and the music so much that I had to buy the soundtrack."
3,Dirty Dancing in Havana,Not as good as the first one but still it was good enough to have enjoyed it. Not sorry to have purchased it.
5,hot hot hot,I LOVED the movie!!! I think that it is the best movie I have seen in a long time! I love Diego Luna or Javier which ever you wanna think about...he is so hot! I think that it is better the the original. I think evey one should go see it!!
5,not the 80's anymore,"people try to compare this film to the 1987 dirty dancing and apart from Patrick Swayze being in both,there is no comparison.i love this film,it deals with issues from the 1950's,racism and social class as well as the cuban take on those american yankees using their country as some sort of country club hide away.Diego Luna is great in all his films and this movie is no exception,the dancing is hot and newcomer Romola Garai reminded me of a sweet teenage Cameron Diaz.if you havent seen this movie SEE IT TODAY!"
5,A Must See!,"As a huge fan of the original Dirty Dancing, I prepared myself for a huge let down. I thought that in no way could this movie capture the magic that the first one did, but I was very wrong. Although, it really isn't a sequel, but rather more a re-write with a twist, it is a great movie worth seeing for anyone. The dance scenes were well done, and the acting was superb. The plot is great because first it deals with the problems that an interracial couple living in different social classes face and it also deals with the struggles that Cuba was facing at the time. If you are in the mode for a great, well told love story check this movie out!"
3,"A fun movie, that delivers what it sets out to sell.","At first I was skeptical about seeing this film, as it's sort of like a remake of the original Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze. However, I was impressed by it. Clearly it wasn't a completely original plot, but being set in Havana in the late 50's during the days leading up to the Cuban Revolution definately gave it flavor. I thought that the performances by Diego Luna and Romola Garai were excellent, and their chemistry was just great. They made it so believable. The music and the dancing is fascinating, however like most films with dancing, it's unfortunate that the editing tends to take away from seeing the dance routines in their entirety, but it's still impressive. All in all, I'd say this film is enjoyable, especially if you liked the first Dirty Dancing and enjoy cuban music and dancing. There's nothing deep about it, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is satisfying enough as it is for its genre."
3,Unoriginal,"The new Dirty Dancing wants to be the the first. Same scenario, same kinds of scene (dancing in the water)It's DD except with a spanish accent. The actors are ok, nice to look at, but there's really nothing there. No funny moments like in the original. I was expecting more and was disappointed."
5,Dirty Dancing Havana Nights Is Amazing,"Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is so good. I loved it. I saw it with my friend it was for our birthdays, and it was like the best birthbay ever. We saw it the day after it came out and then i saw it again a week later. Diego Luna the guy dancer whos name is Javier Suarez is amazing. He is such a good dancer and it so HOTT! Katey Miller the plays the girl dancer is also a really good dancer. Katey and Javier are so cute together. They really make it look like they are in love. Javier is so sweet, and he really respects Katey unlike the other guy James. The music in the movie is so good too. I bought the soundtrack right after i saw the movie. Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is like my favorite movie, and i highly recommend that you see it."
2,"Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights, not much dancing","The story line is as many reviews have pointed out not very good.It would of course have been easily forgotten if the dancinghad been nice instead. However...... the casting directorchose to pick non-dancers instead of someone who had someexperience in dancing. The result is obvious, and the dancingis not good. There are some good dancers as back-dropbut you see them for split-seconds, probably so that it doesn'tbecome too obvious how inexperienced the main-characters reallyare. They have a lot of talent and are doing a good job for theshort time thay have had to practice dancing, but the moviedoes not contain a lot of good dancing.It is very sad that the creators of the movie would just throwaway the money making it, considering that there are a lot ofreally good dancers that could have made the movie a lot moreinteresting. Better luck next time!"
4,Has it's ups and downs.....,"I saw this movie a while back and I thought it was cute. It had that Latin flavor in it with a twist of hip-hop. I have been dancing for years and i thought it was very impressive for some of the moves they had picked up on. It seemed rather sad how Patrick Swayze tried to re-live the moment from the first movie other than that I would say this movie is for young teens now who haven't seen the first Dirty Dancing, other then that I wouldn't say this is the movie for people who fell in love with the first Dirty Dancing."
4,a feel good film,i thik that this film is a good tenage film but i dont think it will apeal to older people who enjoyed the first one but good if u like soppy love films so if u think its for you i would go out and give it a try it wot do u any harm.
4,Great Variety of Workouts,"With three workouts, this video provides the variety I need. Denise Austin is detailed in explaining what you are supposed to do and how you should do it. My only complaint is that some of the excersises are a little too easy. All in all a good purchase."
2,wouldn't buy again,"I did not buy this from Amazon. Got it at a Dept store for use around the holidays. It came with chocolate.... I've used it for 4 or 5 parties. Never had success getting the chocolate to 'drape' properly. The unit is also a disaster to clean. The basin itself cannot be submerged, so it has to be wiped and wiped and wiped. Also you have to clean the unit before the chocolate hardens or else its a nightmare - picture chipping hardened chocolate off everything. the chocolate also cannot go in the sink drain - it'll clog it.I use a mini crock pot instead now. Not elegent, but it's easier to clean. And we also don't have to waste 4 pounds of chocolate to use it... I don't recommend buying this item... it's a waste."
2,Enjoy The First Ten Minutes,"One of my rules to making a good campy B-Movie is never to bury the lead. In short, if you're gonna have nudity, put it at the beginning of the movie. This movie does that with ample amounts as it opens in a sorority house where modesty is completely forsaken. Unfortunately, after that there's no reason to keep watching the movie unless you have a nostalgic crush on Betsy Russell (understandable but I should add she's not in that opening scene) or feel some sense of sick pleasure in watching Vincent Van Patten try to act.I could offer a summary of the plot but in fewer words: Good Native American, Bad Giant Druid, Bad Sea Monster (hey, I'd be bad too if I was a Sea Monster stuck in a lake). Oh, did I mention the Bad Bikers who want to abuse the girls? It's a good thing because the lead pervie Biker turns out to be the hero and finds true love.Watch the first 10 minutes free with Amazon Prime Streaming and start something else. You'll be glad you did."
3,Will do the job.,"Obviously not a performance part, but if you've got an old road bike you need in running condition for as little as possible this should do the trick. Rode around 1000 miles total on this part, hasn't given out yet."
2,eclectic shorts,"This dvd is not what it appears to be . Yes the first short ""Forest"" clocks in at about 2 minutes, and is somewhat interesting in that it does resemble some of the qualities of the 'masters' supposed to be an influence, however the remaining shorts are not much more than hand held home movies shot on one's first vacation.The new Tim Burton, I hardly think so. Let's wait a few years before we start comparing ourselves to the Quays or Svankmajer or Tim Burton. I want my money back! Oh yeah, the music is not bad though. Keep trying!!"
2,AI is frustrating!,"This game sat, unplayed, on my shelf for three years until I found myself sick for a week and decided to give it another try. I had nothing else to play, and had to stay in bed, so I forced myself to give it my best.The characters, graphics, sound, announcer (the great Dave Attel), and courses are all fun and well done. But the gameplay -- oh, boy: a frustrating, ulcer inducing mess! Your computer opponent will routinely make 45 to 50 foot puts when it needs to, while if you're one power percentage off you're left with a gimmie. Each round comes down to two or three opportunites where you can pull ahead and win, but if you miss those you're screwed! If you do manage to win your match you unlock a few, paltry items, but if you lose you get NOTHING except the feeling that you've just wasted 45 mintues of your life. And this is fun, how?I guess you get what you pay for with this one. Oh wait, don't waste you money!"
4,Madge and Ogdon,"I can picture somebody recommending both performances, or neither performance, or just the Madge. I can't picture anybody recommending just the Ogdon. That would have to be politics."
4,Good book,"I liked this book pretty well. My only complaint is I didn't realize what time period it was set during, but once I figured it out, I was able to get into it a bit more."
2,No IEEE 1394 i.Link(DV) output,"Without a ""DV""/1394(i.Link)port, it will be difficult to use with Windows Movie Maker or to send to your standalone DVD recorder. Using the analog audio/video jacks justs defeats the purpose of having an all digital camcorder."
2,Not my cup of tea,I ordered this to give to a friend but was not what I expected. Have not heard from the friend if they liked it or not.
4,Great pasta mix,This is a great pasta mix for a side dish. It is best to leave a little water in the pot when you drain it so the pasta doesn't get too dry; it tends to get a little drier after sitting for a few minutes. Sauce has a good flavor of parmesan and red pepper and the noodles are nice and delicate.
3,DOES IT CONTAIN ITS' ORIGINAL ENDING?,I saw this movie at its' first sneak preview in San Francisco and loved the movie. Then I saw it again on its' regular release and I was astonished! They completely changed the ending of the movie! The orignal ending showed Liza's character many years later after both Gene and Burt were killed thinking back to her earlier years. She has evidently married into wealth and the name of her yacht is Lucky Lady. This ending completely disappeared when the movie went into general release. What a shame. It went from an excellent movie to an ok movie. I hope the dvd will include the original ending.
4,Hillarious at times,"I was not a huge liza manelli fan as a kid, yet, i sure developedinto a huge fan of hers as i matured. looking at this goofey comedywith some great period costumes and cars, boats, brings back somevibes of a time forgotten. If you examine it too closely its really notall that solid, yet, it has a certain charm to it, and an ability to draw onein, from the goofey reynolds to the staunch hackman and the loosemanelli, we are entertained."
3,MAGNIFICENT FILM - HORRENDOUS SUBTITLES,"This series is a masterpiece and would be a great addition to any collection. But it has the most atrocious English subtitles. After having watched this online I was excited to see that it had finally come out. I was very disappointed. The subtitles are full of grammatical errors, spelling errors and crude English slang. It's obvious this was slapped together quickly for quick sale. Part of the beauty of Three Kingdoms is the poetic and dramatic language. Those responsible for the titles in this set have a very basic understanding of English at best. Watch it online first! If you understand Mandarin buy it today!!"
1,Useless,"Tried this product as directed and found nothing to brag about. Completely useless. Like a fool, I ordered a second bottle thinking it was just me and to truly give the product a fight chance. Forget about it. Money down the drain. Please don't waste your money on this product as I don't have the money to throw away and I'm sure neither do you."
1,Sleep a Weigh plus liquid collagen review,"I was not very happy with this product because it actually made my skin break out very bad for several days after just taking it the first day.Also, it may give you very bad indigestion. I was not very happy with this product at all and I would not recommend it to anybody."
5,masse never forgotten,having only been around seven when laurel was with the manhattan transfer iremember her presence really well on the two ronnies and that impression as lasted the whole time until the present day. laurel is sure one of the most talented voices around.this album complements her well. laurel can achieve the best of any song and bring the listener to a standstill . keep up the good work. any other fans with any video clips of laurel solo or in the manhattan transfer email pufnsuf@ntlworld.com would love to hear from you. well done laurel keep up the spirit you have never been forgotten
1,Max Attrax Ant Bait Doesn't Work,"We have ants coming in near our kitchen sink, and 4 of these baits did absolutely nothing. After 3 weeks, the ants remain unfazed, and there was never a day where they were not swarming. I have only seen a few ants even go in the traps, even though there were tons of them around the area. The whole project has been absolutely disgusting. I am more upset about the time wasted trying to let this work than about the wasted money, since having these bugs there makes my skin crawl but you are supposed to let them walk around so they can take the bait. Bought 2 packages, so will take the 2d one back."
2,"Great idea, bad design","I really wanted to like this product, however it failed miserably for its intended use because the main screw slides freely through the top, making it unable to mount onto anything. I must have just gotten a faulty one since I didn't see others report that issue. However, the whole design is also not really appropriate either, it has a very heavy thick metal yet its supposed to clamp onto a delicate telescope eyepiece. Also its not really designed with modern cameras in mind because I would have had to adjust the elevation to the very maximum to be able to center my Nikon coolpix on it. Its kind of clunky too, not a precision instrument. If I could redesign it I'd make the entire frame a lighter yet sturdy plastic and have it more precise in its adjustments. I might have to fabricate my own since this one is going back to Amazon and I don't see any other options."
4,Vignetting when using high magnification eyepieces and/or wide-angle cameras,"If the lens of the eyepiece is smaller than the lens of your camera you will have vignetting. Moreover, I cannot take pictures when using a 4mm eyepiece. However my complaints, I don't see a better choice for my setup. Surely using a longer telescope with a 32 mm eyepiece and a 3x Barlow will give me better results.My setup:- Celestron 21024 FirstScope Telescope (76mm).- 32mm and 17mm eyepieces.- 2x Barlow.- Casio EX-FH100 10.1MP High Speed Digital Camera with 10x Ultra Wide Angle Zoom.Tips:- First locate the spot in the sky or field with the telescope.- Attach the adapter (upside down if using a reflector telescope).- Put the camera.- Use low-magnification & wide eyepieces.- Use a 2x or 3x Barlow (or a combination of them).- Extend the zoom with infinite focus (flash off).- Align the camera the nearest possible to the eyepiece (without touching it).- Use the camera timer."
2,Not Universal !,"My camera, Kodak Z712 IS, has a lens that extends out about 3/4 inch when the camera is on. That is without ANY zoom. The distance from the center of the mounting screw hole to the end of the lens is 2 3/4 inch on my camera. The base mounting plate is not deep enough to allow for this space and I could not get the clamp to hold the eyepiece and mount the camera together. I ended up holding the camera by hand to take any pictures. It may work fine for your camera as long as the center of the mounting screw hole to end of lens distance is 2 1/2 inch or less. (with the camera turned ON)"
4,Great product for the price!,Great cage for the price. Easy to put together. Would recommend this product for anyone looking for a safe cage at a low price. Mid sized cage works great for my year old boxer.
5,Folding Metal Dog Crate,This cage was exactly what I expected. It was easily assembled and sturdy. I very much like the fact that one is able to adjust the size of the cage as the dog grows larger.
4,Good crate for the price,This a good crate for the price the handles can be a pain to open and close but for the price I can't complain that much.
4,It does the job,"We bought this crate so my two small dogs could keep each other company. They both immediately loved it as expected. Unfortunately the little monsters made a game out of jumping and biting off the plastic handles...so handles were gone in less than a day. The plastic base could be a little firmer even when you flip the small lock it has underneath is not static. The one manufacturing mistake I noticed was the divider...there's no way in hell to put that thing on. Two engineers in the house and we just couldn't fit it. We just don't use it. Anyway for the price, is totally worth it."
1,stay away!,After reading good reviews about this product I ordered it with confidence (especially considering the price). I was very disappointed with the quality and had to return the crate. First when I opened it and was trying to set it up I cut my finger. I wouldn't want my dog in there getting cut up so I looked and found that many of the intersections in which wires had been welded together were very sharp. I continued to set the product up and discovered that it would not even set up properly. When I tried to put the walls up they did not align properly and therefore the crate was not secure. This product was very cheaply made. I returned it and got a Best Pet brand crate which I love and so does my new puppy!
1,Not a strong crate,"This crate looked nice and set up easily when i received it, but it didn't last long. I have a mid sized dog, a wheaton terrior, with a strong will. She broke the crate within 2 weeks, She scratched and scratched at the bars next to the door, some of the metal bars started to fall off. She broke out of the crate one day!!! The crate I had previously lasted 6 years and it was still strong, but the bars were starting to get rusted and the plastic tray at the bottom was cracked, so I bought this new crate. Now I wish I had kept the old one."
2,Not well made,"It's easy to set up, but the top latch will not line up and can't be closed. The bottom latch works fine. I would spend a few more dollars and get a better made crate."
5,Dog Crate,I got this crate to tuck in our pug at night to stop her from waking us up early in the morning by banging on our door. At first she didn't like it but now she's used to it. The crate serves its purpose.
5,Grate Crate,"It is what it is but I had been using a few other ""hand me down"" wire crates and this one beat the others hands down. 60 second setup, perfectly aligned latches and the bottom tray is clever. The 21"" height was a bonus for my Boston since most of the 24 X 18 crates were only 19"" high."
5,Arctic Quest,"Kister has written one of the best travel/adventure books I have had the pleasure to read. I believe it to be as good as Eric Newby's, ""A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush."" Looking beyond just his writing, his adventures in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are inspiring to all of us who wish to be better friends, caretakers, and participants of the environment. We will hear much more from this talented young man that is working determinedly for a better tomorrow."
2,Poor quality set - wasn't worth the shipping to send back,"This is a manicure set made in Pakistan. The handles are plastic, one of them came cracked, and the metal part is off-center. The scissors are not very sharp, the movement is difficult.I bought this set as a gift, but when I saw it I fell too ashamed to gift it, and the price of shipping it back just wasn't worth it for me.The set has several pieces, I haven't tried them all. The look and feel is very cheap, even though the black casing is nice, I wish they spent more time on the quality of the product to be used."
1,Just Horrible,When these utensils were placed in the sanitizer solution they began to rust. In all of my years in the cosmetology profession I have never seen anything like that happen to stain less steel.
1,Pure garbage,If there were no stars I would giv it that. They nail clippers are very dull & does not work at all. I will NEVER again purchase anything from that brand again. This product belongs in a dollar store with the price of .75 cents U.S. currency. Never buy anything from Pakistan. Product is pure garbage..
1,should have read the reviews,this scale sucks!! I have had this for a week now and i have stepped on it about 6 times and each time i get a different reading. the first time you are supposed to disregard the reading as you are just setting it up than the second time the reading is about accurate. it first gave me a reading i knew i should have been around the weight from my last doctors visit. then 2 days later it got moved and i had to step on it again i disregarded the first reading and than stepped on it again i had supposedly lost 7 pounds in 2 days. than to make sure it was working i stepped on it again and in 1 minute i had gained back 4 of the 7 pounds i supposedly lost.I am going to have to buy a new scale now so this was a huge waist of money.
5,taylor digital scales great buy,"they work great so far big bold numbers easy to read,great deal for the price, compared to outher digital scales"
3,Unfinished Prayer,"There are signs of the former brilliance found in the writing of this unfinished novel which was published posthumously in 1987. Sadly, is not the great work that Capote had promised. As far as it goes it is an intriguing glimps into the life and thoughts of the author as it seems to be largely autobiographical."
1,Wish He Never Started.....,"Pathetic!!!! Save your time and money.....read the headlines of the Inquirer in the check out line instead!! Mr Capote proves himself to be the biggest ""cat"" of all in this sad commetary on how he views the set that he was rightly banished from.....with friends like him, who needs enemies."
4,Capricious Capote,"Capote's unfinished work is definitely worth reading but read his other stuff first. It takes a seasoned Capote fanatic to really enjoy this book. It is a shame that he never finished it. After reading ""Kate McCloud"" I could not wait to find out what would happen next, but I guess no one will ever know. And we all want to read La Cote Basque 1965 to get the real dirt.But the truth is that Capote was indeed a gifted writer who left us very little to read. So take it all in, even these ""tell all"" stories that have less significance than his earlier work."
3,Somehow disappointing,"Nothing in this unfinished novel that compares to Breakfast at Tiffany's or Music for Chameleons (to state some of the most famous). However, it sure keeps an amusing tone and female characters are well depicted."
1,Answered Prayers?,"After reading ""Answered Prayers"" I must say that it answered no prayer of mine for good or interesting writing. At least it was unfinished."
3,made of same material as stock - most likely wont last long,"i ordered these and from the picture, they looked like that might last a little longer than the regular gears. i have barely run these, for fear of shredding them, and the teeth are already becoming flat. they do however make the car significantly faster, so that is a plus. overall, they are ok, and i think worth the money."
5,Freelance,If your thinking about writing for money than you have to read this book from front to back. Lots of good information.
5,Top Notch,"Only size of sonicare head worth buying. Sure the larger one will get the job done, this just is the rolls-royce version.really makes a difference."
3,"fair scale, but not as sturdy","this is a good scale if you want a simple one that is lightweight. the chrome is actually not true chrome but plastic. it is nice to look at, but not as sturdy as you think from the picture."
2,Interesting but ultimately uninformed,"This book would be a good intro to the world of offshore banking and tax-driven structuring, but for the fact that the author is both misinformed and grinding an axe. For instance, he seems to be deliberately conflating actual tax evasion and money laundering with structured finance, probably to make the book more sensational. It's a shame, because it's a world that most people don't understand and that merits a clear and fair explanation, and because there are very real ethical abuses that it faciliates that get lost in the sky-is-falling nonsense of this book.If you are the kind of person who spends all your time railing about ""The Corporations"" and how we need to stop them, and doesn't understand the business section of the newspaper, then this book is a very small step in a rightish direction. If you're not, then don't bother, because it's a book for dumb people."
4,Eve: A Compelling Tale of Two Psychopaths,"Fallen Angel is an excellent show, but Eve is the ep that should be featured. The suspenseful story of two small girls who kill because they want to fits into the government conspiracy that's going to kill us all. Eve 6 is a haunting yet somehow comforting character, and the two young girls portray the serial killers with acuity."
5,Another bonzer dvd!,"Again this series is fabulous, mildred is especially great, and sargent enright too is great, in fact they are all great, too bad it cdidnt go on for a bout 10 series."
5,One of Spain's Best Poets,"Gil de Biedma might not be as well known as Garcia Lorca, but he is without a doubt one of the best and most influential poets of Spain's 20th Century. Until his death in 1990, Gil de Biedma crafted poems that reflected the harsh reality of Spain under Franco, the ills of modern life, and the melancholy reliefs of his social life. Accessible yet complex, his verses are among the best in the last 50 years."
1,Contemporary Trigonometry: A Graphing Approach,I would review this product but I have yet to receive it. It was supposed to come on June 15th. Its now June 24th. Whatever you do don't buy anything from Nytek. Its been very frustrating.
2,"Unique, but low quality","I bought this lamp in January 2005, and after a 6 months the LED lights began to go. Almost precisely after the 1 year warrantee period was over, many more of the ligths started to go out, and now all of them are out.For the price, this is annoying.I also agree that the thing looks cheap, is surprisingly bulky and is hard to position. I agree with most other people's comments about the buttons, look, and volume issues.That said, it does do a good job of waking me up pleasantly. The light is quite ""white"" and somehow leaves me alert (or left me alert until it broke).Still, I am considering trying some of the alarm clocks that plug into your existing bedside table lamp. I'm just annoyed at having spent this much money on something that seems impossible to fix and is just plain ugly."
4,The Master Composer Himself,"How amazing would it be to actually listen to Beethoven play piano, or Bach play organ? Well, on this Naxos recording you can lsiten to Rachmaninoff play his own piano concertos! While the first and fourth concertos are not nearly as popular as the second and third, they are still very interesting pieces. To hear the composer himself explore them, and ""Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,"" is truly special. The only shortcoming of these recordings is they were made in the late 30s and early 40s, and the sound quality, while it was state of the art in its time, does not measure up to today's standards. This recording is not for classical audiophiles whose number one criteria is high fidelity. But if you place importance on empathetic playing and are intrigued at the prospect of hearing the music from the master composer himself, then this is worth it."
1,VERY BIASED,"I am an archaeologist and historian, and bought this book hoping to read an unbiased account of this controversial event. Instead, this book is extremely biased, unprofessional, riddled with errors, and simply a complete waste of time."
1,"Denoke????? read the first review, save your money...","...and a BIG disappointment, not to say downright deception; curiosity killed me too but I've exchanged the cd's. The 'soundtrack' must have matched the visuals of the production... mediocrity all the way... the Volga indeed... you can hear and see it in Krombholc's recording, just listen to the ouverture; Mackerras is a solid second, as in all his recordings of Czech operas, where against the 'opinions' of Gramophone, for whom british is always best, you ca'nt go wrong with Supraphon..."
4,An eye-opening book for all African-Americans,"Hutchinson's book is one in a million. As a concerned African-American trying to learn how to make it our society, the book is a an eye-opener and a reinforcement of some of the same values I hold dear. In some of the chapters of ""Crisis in Black and Black"", Hutchinson brings to the reader's attention issues that most of us have proabably never thought of before (if we honestly look at ourselves they are true, whether we wish to admit them or not). There are more of us who are ""conservative"" and if we look at the admired ""radicals"" of the 1960s and previous ages, we see that what they have said is exactly what the ""sell outs"" have said. I would have given the book five stars, but there was one chapter in his book that I strongly disagreed with, and it had to do with Black gays. (Forgive me, Mr. Hutchinson, I guess my ""fundamentalist Christian"" views just won't allow me to buy what you wrote) Other than that, it is an eye-opener worth reading."
1,No need to fear,"In seminary, I looked at this nonsense while writing a paper on Luther. As far as Luther goes, the man was a medieval anti-Semite. What's remarkable is that for a brief moment he had some spark of compassion in his heart. Erikson's <Young Man Luther> will help the student chart Luther's journey from visionary to beer sodden sourpuss.Now what makes this half baked book really interesting is what it tells you about the church's corruption during the Nazi era. Sadly, the confessing church was a minority.I was looking at this book again as it relates to the wooly theology of the Christian identity movement.Why are books like this allowed? In America, we believe that the Constitution is stronger than the nastiest racist tract. The Bill of Rights is a wonderful thing."
5,A must-have!,"From the novice to the veteran fly fisher this books makes it all clear. Not only does the author give clear instructions on how to tie flies, he's included detailed drawings & excellent up close photographs of numerous flies. The added stories make for an interesting read too."
1,crappola,"This book was required for a course I took called ""Postmodernism"". While I do not dispute the intelligence of these authors, I do question their communicability and the success of their ""arguments"". The task they take on is to destroy the Hegelian dialectic. Do they succeed? If you were to remove their self-absorbed semantics which riddle the text with unexplained vocabulary, sans apology, you would find there is not much really there. My proof is that a respected and intelligent professor could not interpret, rework and teach the same material much less communicate it. It is an exercise in ambiguity."
3,good for certain uses,"I have been through MANY sippy cups such as Playtex, Born Free, Avent, Munchkin and Nuby. Both of my daughters had a hard time transitioning from the bottle to the sippy cup. My daughters are now 28 months and 10 months old. My youngest daughter is starting to transition to a sippy cup and she just picked it up and drank from it with no problems. I wonder if the other brands have too many pieces with it making it more complex for a baby to get much from it.I love these cups because they are BPA Free and have 2 pieces the cup and the lid. With my previous cups there were TOO MANY PIECES and I would loose a piece and have to go buy a whole new cup. I wish I found out about these earlier.Unfortunately this cup is too small for formula...only lets in 4-5 ounces so I would only use this for water. My daughter is now up to 8 ounces of formula. It drips if you turn upside down."
3,"Like it, but doen't last as long as i would like.","Don't get me wrong, I like the concealer. The only thing I found wrong with it is it doesn't last as long as i'd like for the price. Also, your skin needs to be VERY moisturized or it's going to look like chalk on your skin since it's so dry. I wouldn't reccommend buying the $40 application brush because your fingers work much better!"
3,performance: 5 stars; sonics: 2 stars,"In the last 30 years I've listened to two different LP versions of this recording (the single-LP containing Cto #1 with the same cover as this SACD, and the double-LP version that contained both concertos plus the Andante Spianato) as well as the CD release from the '90s. The performances are excellent, but unfortunately, the recording was never done well, so the SACD engineers didn't have much to work with. If you purchase this knowing what to expect, you will enjoy the performance, but if you wish to have a ""show-off"" SACD for when company comes over, another Living Stereo such as the Offenbach Gaite Parisienne (which was recorded several years *earlier* than the Chopin) will knock your proverbial socks off."
3,"Edible, not great","Generally I buy frozen and not canned artichokes, so this may explain why I did not care for this product. It sort of squeaks in your mouth. In addition, there are quite a few tough parts included. Edible, not great."
2,Not that great.,All of the cans were dented and the artichokes are not tender. I wont purchase again. The tiny artichokes are so much better.
1,Awful product,"I've been buying this product for about a year by the 12 units case. The last 2 cases have been horrible, I should have stopped buying them when I got the first bad one. 2 of the 12 cans were banged and when I opened them the artichokes were spoiled, awful smell and color. The rest of the 10 cans all of them taste weird, don't know if over ripe. I ate them anyway they didn't seem spoiled just unpleasant taste that i disguised with dressing. Next case same weird flavor. I will buy them at the grocery store from now on by the unit, price is even cheaper in some stores."
5,"If you are seeking for new inspiration, this is an excellente book","Teaching Graphic Design offers a comprehensive array of topics and teaching tips for all levels. It includes an overview, course requirements, suggestion for projects and selected readings, enabling teachers to choose inspiring topics and materials to structure your class intelligently."
2,Dry rudimentary class outlines,Uninspiring drivel that disables the ability to read or to create. Don't bother to spend your money on this book.
2,Morning 'Glory,"A forgettable piece of fluff with Harrison Ford's dead performance making it irritating at times. The heroine's bouncy, fakely upbeat manner is annoying. Save me from such shallow airheads. Definitely something I wouldn't voluntarily see again."
2,Not my cup of tea,I agree with another reviewer that this movie started out boring and was almost too silly. I was looking for something on the scale of 27 Dresses. The story line was drawn out a bit.
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed watching Morning Glory. Harrison Ford's constant grumpy demeanor was not like his usual roles and I missed his trademark quirky smile. But it was consistent with the role he was given. We had some laugh-out-loud moments, but most were quiet chuckles."
1,morning glory,"The copy that I received is a pirated/counterfit copy. I arrived promptly, it was packged correctly, but it is an illegal version. ISBN numbers were missing, It looked like the movie was placed into a diferent jacket. It was sold like new, but it looks like it could have been seen previously. There are too many red flags with this package.Mrs. Culbertson"
4,Good little movie,"Good little movie to watch with your wife while spooning. Funny and sexy at the same time. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."
3,Harrison Ford channels his inner Clint Eastwood,"I'm not sure if Harrison Ford intentionally changed his voice for this role but man was it gruff.The movie was predictable but cute. A good rent once and leave it movie. I definitely will not be purchasing it.If you are a romantic comedy movie buff this movie will not disappoint.If you are a movie buff, don't bother."
4,Excellent!,"I just saw and met these guys last night at a show in Denton, TX. I bought this CD from them. There are a lot of different styles here. Influences range from Elliot Smith and American Analog Set to Palace and Bedhead. They said they were very proud of the album when I asked for a copy, and one can hear why. My fave line: ""It's hard not to crumble under the pressure of an angry woman."""
5,starry-eyed,"This is my favorite album -- it has been since the day I received it. It's become familiar and personal. I never get tired of listening to the Manx, and I RECOMMEND them to everyone who wants to hear dreamy harmony, thoughtful lyrics and a really pleasing sound. The combined genius of these four guys is amazing. The CD cover above is your first clue to the creative talent of the band...one of the members painted it. Definitely buy this music...listen to it often...sometimes it feels like they're singing right to you"
1,faulty microphone,"the microphone did not work from the day i recieved it. I ordered this because of the great reviews it was getting. I now have a telex, USB digital microphone that is incredible, it was worth the money, so that is what i reccomend."
2,Do not expect to learn something new,"Hi,I am a computer scientist, and I have some experience in heuristics design in many optimization problems. I have carefully read the book, and I didn't found anything really new inside. All what you will learn is : ""It depends on the problem"".All the book treats cooking ideas (cuisine), nothing scientifically proved. The reasonning in the book is so evident, so simple.I appeciated in the book the ""exhotic"" problems that the authors gave. They allow the reader to think. But these problems have nothing to do within the context they are inserted in. By solving them, you will not learn anything in heuristics theory.In general, the book is not detailed enough, not formal enough, very few brilliant ideas are inside. The ideas are explained in textual form, etc. All is cuisine and heuristics with questionable experiments, etc.An aware computer scientist"
4,Acuatlidad de Crystal Report 8.5,"These is a goob reference, its very complete and cover the .NET orientation."
2,How about the INCOMPLETE Reference,"This book was a waste of money. It is more of a beginner's guide and tutorial than a reference book. Needs to add a reference section for all of the functions available in the formula editor. Even though the cover claims .NET programming, there were no samples. The CD contains only 24 sample reports (they could of used a floppy instead). If you are new to Crystal Reports go ahead and get this. If you have any experience don't bother."
1,"A Poorly Written and Poorly Xeroxed ""Handout""","I was very disappointed in the content, editing, and xeroxing quality of this ""book."" The ""OCR"" typeface used is difficult to read, and there is no reader layout/formatting help with bolding, indentations, etc. It's like reading a line printer listings from the 1960s. The printer to generate the copier original was evidently not high resolution, and the GBC plastic ""spiral binding"" is flimsy.There is no overview for the book nor how the examples are organized, and the cutsie/folksy phrases, Whew!, and overusage of exclamation points grow tiresome. The ""massive collection"" of scripts amounted to 31 basic scripts on a floppy. I have degrees in SW engineering and am used to nerdy styles, but for this book's price I expected something far more professional and accessible."
5,EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY,YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS BINOVIEWER FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY.I HAVE USED THIS NUMEROUS TIMES NOW SINCE PURCHASED AND THE VIEWS ARE PHENOMENAL. I CHECKED OUT MANY BINOVIEWERS BEFORE PURCHASING THIS ONE AND COULD NOT BEAT THE PRICE AND NOW AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY DECISION.FRIENDS ARE ALSO AMAZED WITH THE QUALITY AND EASE OF ITS USE.
1,Trash,"This CD is a heretical abomination. Trent Reznor never even sings a note in this entire compilation! Practically sacreligious pop ""artists"", if you can even call them that, destroy Trent's music. I have no idea how this is a tribute NIN at all. IT IS SIMPLY THE MOST HORRIBLE CD YOU CAN BUY. If you even remotely like NIN stay away from this garbage."
1,undeserving of being called Nine Inch Nails,"i bought this cd because trent reznor has never let me down before. had i not just paid $16 for it, i would have smashed it immediately after my first time listening to it. it is nothing like reznor's music. the music itself is ok. it is very techno, and i kinda liked it. it's not nin, but it's stuff i would listen to. the problem is the lyrics. there is really no remixing, just different music in the background. i listen to nin because of the emotion reznor puts in his music. this has none of it. one of the groups sounds like the jackson 5. i find it hard to believe reznor would agree to this. if he didn't, i hope he sues them for ruining his music. don't buy this under any circumstances."
4,A swan's beauty 'swims' through this book.,"I knew that immediately after finishing Evan Maxwell's first book, that I would wish to read more by him. His style of writing reminds me so much of another favorite male author of mine, Nicholas Sparks. I enjoy reading a variety of genres, but to read a tender, romantic book written by a man, is really a special treat. The only negative comment I would make about this book is that I wish the author would have developed the character of Bran Corry a little more thoroughly. I found myself asking questions about his earlier life. However, that did not keep from thoroughly enjoying this beautiful book. Please keep writing Mr. Maxwell."
2,"It's a little fan, it can only do so much.",I have a problem with my Graphics Processor Unit overheating. I ordered and installed this fan. It is still overheating. This would be a good fan to add to Atom boards that run a little too warm. It will not work miracles though.
3,Okay,"We bought this book for our son who had just turned 3. The story in the book is cute, but my son did not buy into it. (Maybe she wants to be in school, but I don't.)Still, the story is simple and I know quite a few kids who might like it.But what we did not like at all was the illustrations. I just thought they looked odd, but my son said that the kid looks like a monster and everything else is ugly too. Well, I would not be that cruel, but he has a point there."
5,Ready for preschool and I can't wait!,"We read this book substituting the word ""preschool"" where nursery school was used for a few weeks before my daughter started school. It helped to give her an understanding of what to expect. She still wants us to read this to her every day. It is such an adorable story with wonderful illustrations of children at preschool doing the typical activities of art projects, dancing, playing, snack and lunch time. We highly recommend this book."
2,Maps missing,The Book includes a lot of hikes and nice spots on Kauai but it was not a big help anyway. The different hikes are not rated by difficulty and also no estimated time is given. Even worse is that maps of the hikes are missing so you lack orientation when you are on your way - I personally would even appreciate topographical maps - but not even knowing which trails I would cross or whether there were any alternative routs was very annoying. Furthermore description of the trail heads is unclear. Different hikes that are not alternative routes are described in the same chapter which makes reading confusing. All together I can not recommend this book.
2,"Only if your idea of a vacation is hiking...otherwise you need a supporting guide book from LP, Fodors, etc.","Pro: In-depth coverage on hiking.Cons: Black & white photos, with the exception of a few pages (seriously?). Only TWO pages each on hotels and places to eat (and they only recommend by placing the name in bold font).Unless you only want to hike, I would go elsewhere. And I was so looking forward to seeing how this publisher captured tourism."
1,Where to surf???,"Titled ""Where to x, y, z, surf"" I eagerly turned to the Table of Contents for surfing info for my teenagers. Not a single entry in the table of contents on surfing! OK, perhaps it's scattered, so I'll check the Index. Nope, only one entry in the index and that is to surf lessons (which we don't need).I admit I seldom get an ""A"" for patience, but a book titled ""Where to ... surf"" I feel should deliver some surfing where to's without having to dig it out, just saying."
2,Poorly organized,"I wouldn't recommend this book for a few reasons:-incoherent organization: sections are not keyed to a larger map of the Island. Directions are written in narrative form where a simple small map would do. Generally the maps could be far more descriptive.-pointless use of Hawaiian language: rather than say ""turn right"" or ""turn left"" for driving directions, the authors instruct ""turn mauka"" or turn ""turn maiki"". Which requires turning to the glossary to decipher.-there isn't too much of it but the filler sections: such as multiple acronyms for ALOHA are a waste of space."
2,"not an easy ""quick reference"" guide to use.","compared to my favorite guide, this is lacking. too much page-flipping to get all the info for each activity, i thought."
2,No trail maps,"For a something touted as a guidebook for all things outdoors in Kauai, I found it very frustrating that there are no, repeat no, trail maps in this book. There are instead, detailed instructions for locating starting points and trailheads. Even Recon Marines use maps. The last thing I wanted to do is spend time deciphering clues and searching for landmarks the author provides. Fortunately I had another guidebook which I relied on. In that book it took not time at all to locate places and follow the maps."
2,Wordy and redundant!,"The only truly entertaining Tom Brown book is The Tracker...I loved that book and have been disappointed with all the rest...this book is very wordy and redundant as stated...especially the first story! Why not tell the country or location??? Peccaries surely give us a clue since they are only found in N & S America! The Tiger story was the best in my opinion...Buy the Tracker and if you must, go to a library for the others."
1,Ludicrous,"A sly textbook example of how not to write? Doubtful, but it would've been laughable were it not purportedly true.e.g. Our seemingly magical hero, Tom Brown Jr., challenges 34 rude and skeptical Navy Seal types to a little game of hide and seek--in an area about the size of, say, a couple of football fields. So, of course, with evidently little or no effort on Brown's part he sets about dispatching, so to speak, each one of these highly trained killing machines, one by one, and..."
4,Good Book,I like this book. I ordered it because I like Micheles site. It has god information in it for each day of the year & what your color means.
1,A misleading book,"This appears to me to be fundamentally an advertisement for Pantone, and has very little relationship to the astrology and numerology that are claimed to be a part of the book.Yes, the colors are pretty, and it is nice to have the Pantone numbers for them. But since astrology depends on the date (and, ideally, time) of birth, including the year, and there is no mention of year of birth, the validity of the astrological information provided is moot.Similarly, numerological interpretations require some basis - typically an individual's name - and there is no way of providing this information.So, if you want pretty colors and their Pantone numbers, buy this book ... but don't buy it for any other reason."
3,REALLY GREAT,"This book was quite good, the baby sitter's are fighting but you cannot always be perfect! Everything turns out great in the end as usual-still a good read!"
4,Leapster-Backyardigans,"My 5yr old was excited about receiving this, but immediately she started off on Level 2 and basically after a couple of days was done with it! a bit too 'slow' for her pace. Definitley recommend for 4yr olds!"
5,Great buy for my son,"My son loves the Backyardigans and video games. This is the perfect mash up of the two. I love that he is learning (and can play this so well on his own considering that he is only 4) and he loves that he is playing a video game. If your young kids love video games I highly recommend these. They will learn a lot and have fun, too."
5,very good Leapster Product ! Ideal for young children !,"I Brought this for my 5 year old son Abel , He Loved it ! This was a good learning program .... Leapster Is# 1 learning systems for young children ! Great will continue to buy more products by leapster !Oh yeah these characters were very cute and funny .Thank YouMs. Y. Allison NYC , NY"
5,LOSING WEIGHT AT HOME,"DONT HAVE TIME FOR A GYM BUT I DID FOR EATING. THIS TAPE WAS AWESOME HELPED ME LOOSE 30 PDS. WOULD ORDER FRM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. THEY E-MAILDED ME THROUGH EVERY STEP, WHEN THEY RECIEVED MY ORDER WHEN IT SHOULD ARRIVE, AND WHEN THEY SENT IT OUT. THEY WERE VERY EFFICENT."
3,Hit the Spot: Arms & Bust (VHS),The product arrived in a timely manner. The tape was in fair condition. There is some distortion on the tape but not enought that I couldn't use it.
4,good but not complete,"the 5 dvd set was good but it is incomplete and leaves the resolution unsolved. Since this is the second of the ""outlaw years"" with 22 episodes, I was disappointed. What happens to the characters in a finale is not told. These episodes are good but . . ."
5,Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years,"This is my second purchase of these movies, I purchased this for a friend of mine. They are great and I know they will be enjoyed."
4,Street Boss,"Street Boss is non stop from beginning to end. Being from Saginaw I found it very interesting to see local places in the movie. After seeing the movie and a book club meeting with the FBI agent with whom this movie is based on, I am glad to know ""some"" liberties were taken in the movie."
1,"""Street Hoax""","What a complete let down! This movie should be classified as ""Below Average"". The description and cover photograph of the DVD is misleading and deceiving. First of all Vincent Pastore is shown on the frame cover front and back(largest image of him)appearing to portray an active role when in fact he only appears in the movie for no more than five minutes! The acting was terrible! A disappointment for Nicholas Turturo who was excellent in the movie""Witness to the Mob"",Carmen Argenziano was dressed too flashy to be at home alone waiting for her hubby to come home,Robert Gallo and Mark Bierlein gave a below average performance and last but not least the worst performance goes to Reggie Gaskins and Edward Carnavale."
3,need more (and better) Jellabies tie-ins,"My two-year old and I really like the gentle wiggly Jellabies, their crusty narrator Rik Mayall, and the lovely tunes. I would like to find more toys or tapes of these creatures, but there is little out there and the quality is inconsistent. , As far as I can tell, there are two lift-the-flap books. This is the weaker of the two. In this one you examine all the Jellaby transportation devices under the pretext of their being used at the Jelly World Fair. In the other, ""Where Is Pepper?"", the writing is a bit better. The pages are pretty sturdy and easy to clean.If your children enjoy the Jellabies, they will probably like this little book."
2,A little slippery.,Beautiful sleak design but not functional. The smooth surface does not allow for sufficient grip of food item.
3,looks good. not sure if it's really stainless steel,the chopsticks feel quite lightweight. doesn't quite feel like stainless steel. It should feel heavier if it's all made in metal. Maybe someday I should cut one and see what's inside.I gives 3 stars because it doesn't feel heavy enough. The rest are good. My wife like it. My wife said it feels quite solid.
2,Don't waste your money!,"Although the strap is made of sturdy enough fabric, I don't trust the closing mechanism. It's a loop through sliding closure and it only stays tight if there's weight pulling on it. When I lift my camera up to take a picture and then let it back down, it slides further and further down the strap. If you don't watch carefully, you camera will end up lying on the ground. I would never trust this strap for my camera! Thoroughly dissapointed!!!"
4,pay attention...,"Okay, so I looked through about seven or eight reviews before I bought this book. The reviews were positive and the subject matter is oneI have been interested for many years.I added this book to my library of personal finance books to broaden my knowledge and understanding of the subject. Oops!!! I boughta used textbook. Yep, I didn't even realize after reading through the reviews that this was a college textbook.So while it has a tremendous amount of useful information it is a textbook without a class environment or feedback. Useful perhapsbut not the book I thought I was buying. So pay attention unlike I didn't."
3,Slow... but it's pretty!,"I bought the bamboo katana for my husband. It took FOREVER to get here and when it arrived, the box was desimated. Thankfully, the katana itself was both intact and pretty.I gave it only 3 stars, not because of the product but because it took almost three weeks to arrive."
3,I bought this sword for my son with a Samurai Sword Workout DVD,My son must have been a little too rough with it. The sword broke in half after only about 2 months of use.
2,I really thought I bought something different.,"The real item given to me is completely different than the one depicted on the picture. I isn't all that shiny, and the shape is a little distorted, but now I'm just nit-picking. The paint is thick, and it dents very easily when practicing. The grip will slip off when handling it towards the bottom, which is how kendo sticks should be practiced as. The guard will also become a problem, and irritate the wrist after a while."
5,A worthy investment,"This book is remarkably thorough and has enough practice exercises to keep a budding egyptologist busy for years. Well-grounded in linguistic theory and including many essays on Egyptian culture and history, this is THE book to buy if you wish to start learning to read Egyptian."
3,A nice reference,"This book has some good information about folklore, crystal systems, and some metaphysical information. There are photographs and suggested uses for every mineral included, although some of the photographs are not characteristic of the species as a whole. This is a good beginner's reference."
5,Great product!,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandfather. The product was shipped on time and no damage to the package at all. Perfect for a war vet that loves these movies! My grandfather was so excited about this gift! Thanks!
1,Not worth the money,"I didn't expect much and got less than I expected, have tried selected movies and the quality of the movies are terrible, picked a couple of the movies that I had seen on tv, the quality is worse on the dvd than the original movies. did find one movie that I could actually watch to the end. If you would like it cheap I will send you my disks, just pay for shipping."
2,"old, old movies",too many old black and white movies. have seen most of them before. not all of them are WWII movies.
3,50 War Movie pack,"As an avid WWII movie buff, I found most of this collection features older movies (30 from 1940 - 1959) with another 10 from the 60's and half a dozen from the 70's. There were even two from 1934 and 1936. Most of them are worthwhile with a few 'duds' thrown in to make the magical number of 50. For instance, I don't think many of us would expect Mexico and Pauncho Villa to be included in a 'Combat Classic' Collection. Realizing the cost and hours of entertainment to be realized, it was enjoyable for the most part. Don't expect all of them to be top knotch movies but if you enjoy older movies then you'll find this collection worthwhile."
4,Great Deal from Mill Creek Entertainment,"I bought this collection mainly for ""This Is The Army"" Featuring Ronald Reagan. It was a great oscar winning film that is not available on DVD so when I saw it on this collection I instantly purchased it. The quality of the films included in this set varies some films are very good transfers while others are not very well presented. But overall all the films are watchable and the lack of quality adds to the vintage feel of the included films. I recommend this set for its great value, 50 movies will keep you entertained for hours on end."
4,Combat Classics 50 MoviePack,"As a collector of war movies this collection offers me a large number of the classics at an excellent price. The quality of the recordings is as good as can be expected considering that they were transferred from film to digital. In terms of entertainment value, the movies vary from good to ok to pretty poor to terrible, but when you buy 50 in a pack, that's probably the expected range of reviews. It was surprising to see Civil War and even Napoleon War titles amongst what is billed as a combat collection, but they are a welcome surprise addition. If you like movies that scream patriotism and glory, good guys triumphing over evil, at times with cliched story-lines, then its worth adding to your movie shelf."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad.","One of these went bad on me after less than a month. There are metal contacts in the base that rust very quickly, and need almost daily maintenance to keep working. There is also a very small piece of plastic on the lip of the water tank that pushes a little recessed switch on the base that prevents it from running when the tank isn't connected. It is (and was) very easily broken, and no amount of superglue would keep it from breaking repeatedly - it's just too fragile. The thing won't run without it unless you figure out a way to jam something in there as a temporary fix. Thankfully, the store I bought it from took it back. If only I had read the reviews here first, I would have the inconvenience."
1,Buyer Beware,This product assembled easily. The instructions were clear. The product worked beautifully for a couple weeks and then simply quit. My attempts to get information from the manufacturer were unsuccessful.
4,Pretty Decent Coat,"Bought this coat since I like the look of duster coats and it's made pretty well all around aside from the interior flannel. The interior flannel portion of this coat rips and falls out fairly easily, but it's not really needed since the outside portion of this duster is fairly tough. If you stand in the sun for too long with this coat it'll start smelling like it's burning, but that may just be since I live in Arizona and the sun heats rocks enough to cook eggs on em'."
4,conduit braught this tape down,"I dont know what it was but conduit just wasnt that great of an episode, but it still wasnt a bad one either. But the money maker for this tape has to be ICE. Ice is about a parasite that gets into the back of people necks and can infect others with it. And of course mulder and scully, and a few other people are trapped in with whoever has it in their neck. i wont say who, but this episode is in my top 5. But i would say only rent it, because of conduit braught this tape down, if they would of replaced conduit with eve or something like that this would be perfect"
4,It's 9 BUCKS,"This is the cheapest PC gaming controller on the market. It's easy to use, and it works. In 1990 we thought the even less equipped two button nintendo game pad was the best thing since sliced bread. Let's not get greedy for 9 bucks. If you want a good controller for occassional gaming, go for this one. I have it, and I love it. It took me 3 trips to COMPUSA for it to finally be in stock, so apparently I'm not the only one. Enjoy."
1,It not good enough,It isn't good. it feels good for pc games but when you play emulators like Super Nintendo (TM) the top two buttons do the same thing the green and yellow buttons do and the buttons get stuck once in a while.Why is the turbo button on there when it does nothing? Remove it. The D-pad sometimes annoys me if you press up it goes left up and messes up my game. Listen to me it sucks!!!! Buy it if you want
5,One of the best,Fantastic. Different as I remember foim initial release in Australia in early 80s. I think many cuts were made for political reasons.
5,A most enjoyable experience,"I have finished reading From This Day Forward, (Memoirs Of An Attache Wife), and want to say that I loved it. What an interesting, rich, varied life Helen Rodman and her family have led, and with what gusto and equanimity she tells the story! I dropped everything in order to get on with reading this book and brooked no interruption till I got to the end."
5,"""sling things""","Just what the gun ordered...thanks for the great products ,when you can't find it anywhere else. easy distructions(directions)for those who did'nt get it. thanks"
5,anonymous,"This book is an absolute must read for anyone seeking true insight into the current political situation in Haiti. I'd also recommend Mr. Garrison's second book, ""Aristide: Death of a Nation."" Mr. Garrison has no agenda with this book, he was simply a witness to history and tells things from his unique perspective. It would be wise to ignore those who gave negative reviews to this book, as I highly doubt they ever even bothered to read it all the way through (if they even bothered reading the first chapter). Mr. Garrison remains committed to Haiti, initiating projects to help with reforestation among other things. He is a man with a true desire to help Haiti. Can the same be said about Jean-Bertrand Aristide? I think not. Whether one accepts the truths addressed by Mr. Garrison in this book or not, nobody can deny the gross misuse of funds by Aristide while the Haitian people continued to suffer. I'd recommend this book to anyone who cares about Haiti and the Haitian people."
3,For older child,"I bought this book to read to my 5 year old granddaughter. While the story is cute, the point of the story was to difficult for her to understand - I.e. The dog never gets a name."
2,"Lots of programmability, but control is scattershot","The Gravis GamePad Pro was the first gamepad I gravitated towards after doing some major gaming-oriented computer upgrades. It looked cool, had plenty of support features, the Gravis name, and the unique D-pad feels like it would be perfect for all sorts of gaming.Much of this is true. The software is excellent, all buttons are completely programmable to your needs, and it's easy to install. The downside comes with calibration. I calibrated in Windows and within specific games and the GamePad Pro could never achieve a satisfactory calibration. The cars in my racing games were all over the place, taking the fun factor to zero. Very frustrating.I returned this controller and exchanged it for the far superior Microsoft Sidewinder Gamepad USB. This controller may fare better on some other types of games or other systems, but it was certainly not for me."
2,Guess what...poor calibration,"I bought a Gravis Gamepad Pro about 7-8 years ago and it is still going strong to this day. My 6 year old and I have been playing Wakeboarding unleashed and knew we needed another gamepad. So this past weekend I bought the Gravis Eliminator Gamepad Pro. Unfortunately, I cannot calibrate it correctly. It keeps wandering to the left or right.When i called Gravis and asked, the lady with the foreign accent at tech support tried telling me that it was the game and that I needed to try another. I told her this was my only game. She said then that a technician would call me back.... still waiting.It's going back to the store."
2,Disappointed,"I had a lot of problems with this game pad. In using it, it was a little too sensitive. I tried adjusting it and just can't seem to get it just right. Too time consuming to figure out the right adjustments for each game you want to play. d"
2,platforming or fighting games? forget it...,"if you're planning to use this controller with fighting games or platforming (such as mario or street fighter ii), forget this thing...it feels nice, looks nice, but the directional pad [is a peice of junk], no precision AT ALL...I couldn't even pull off a sheng long or a fireball until the 5th try (and i've been an SF junkie since 91) and i couldn't time my jumps correctly in super mario (been a mario junkie since 85!)this would be ok for rpgs i guess...i'm about to return it and get a psx-usb adaptor."
1,"Calling this a ""controller"" is a dirty lie","This is by far the WORST controller I have ever used. The calibration is terrible, and the little ""Precision"" button is a joke. While playing Final Fantasy VII (with an emulator), my characters have attacked each other just because of the controller's sporadic nature. The up directional button doesn't work at all--my characters just end up going down instead--and the cursor goes crazy without even touching it. Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this device. You will be terribly disappointed. Today I went out and bought a Logitech Dual Action Gamepad for the same price at Best Buy. We'll see how that goes."
3,Open Innovation,"In many parts of the world, the researches setting off from similar thoughts may put forth similar ideas. In the gradually developing information era, accessing this information is much easier. Open Innovation appears as a book supporting the concept of outsourcing in R&D. In this book, not only benefiting from the technology, but also the activities required to achieve it are explained. So, a new vision is provided to companies' innovation processes. This book is a study supporting the rapid development of opening out with regard to innovation."
5,Pretty neat!,"I bought this for my math dork husband per his request. We plugged it in and he easily set it, but I'll admit that I had to look up instructions on how to read it. However, the learning curve is pretty short because now it just takes a glance for me to figure it out. As a bonus, we amuse ourselves by ""seeing"" different shapes as the lights change. As other customers noted, it is super bright. We have a pet hedgehog (who is nocturnal) and we ended up moving it so the room wouldn't be as lit for her. It's now on the other side of our rather large den, but even with my non-stellar eyesight, I can easily tell the time. We are very happy with this clock!"
2,Not original recordings,"I've listened to several cuts from the album Warner Mack Greatest Hits,and none of them sound like the originals.At one time I had all these songs on two Decca records and they were great. Come on Decca, release those original masters!"
5,TOP STUFF,"This CD is one of the best Clubland CD's that have been released, obviously a little dated now but the music will always stand as no matter how old the CD, the remix sticks if its good enough and the tracks and remixes on this CD are totally top notch. A must buy for any true Dance fan."
4,SO EXCITED,"The map was smaller than I expected it would be, even though the dimensions are listed. I was very happy with it though and can't wait to put it up in my apartment."
4,Almost 5/5...,"I bought this as a present, and I am very happy with it. The only problem with it, was that it was very difficult to take it out of its sheath, and when we finally got it out, there was sticky goo all over it. And after using some goo-be-gone product, the graphic on the blade came off."
3,"Leather Grip is loose, markings on blade smeared",The markings on the blade were smeared from some sticky junk they had in the sword casing. took a while to get out of the casing because of this sticky junk all over the blade. took a good 30 minutes to wipe down and had to scrub off the markings because they look ridiculous smeared. otherwise it is a very believable sword...just poor packaging i guess.
2,Bad quality,This book looks like it was obviously stolen from a public library andit had stickers all over it...just terrible quality.
1,"Very loud humm using amplifier, annyoing humm using just headset","I've tested this by calling at least 4 different people -- After a great deal of messing with the boom I was able to keep from sounding like darth vader, but everyone complained of an annoying humm that bothers the person I'm talking too. It does so if connected to the amp or directly to my computer. I've not had these problems with my other labtec headset.I could deal with this (ie replace the headset) but there is a very loud humm using amplifier even at the lowest volume, and at high volume it is too painful to leave on. I tried using the amplifier plugged in and with batteries. I tried it with the headset it came with and my other headset which I know is good. I tried it on two computers.Any way I try this setup and parts, they just don't work well enough to use and am trying to return them."
2,"Interesting cases, but a dearth of specifics","Considering the hefty price tag, this book was a major disappointment. As an aspiring producer, I was hungry for specific technical info about the marketing of movies in today's cutthroat environment. I expected Luuk to walk me through the movie marketing process step-by-step, from beginning to end. Instead, she adopts an anecdotal approach, focusing on the marketing of one movie in each of several genres. This might have been valuable had she employed any kind of analysis and selectivity, but she seems to have merely interviewed the key players, and presented their responses in unbelievably long, unedited quotations. Had it been her avowed intention to present complete interviews with movie marketers, this would be fine, but it was not.All in all, a disappointment. I would not recommend this book."
1,TIUU IS CRAZY,"THe book didnt go indepth at all with what i expected to learn from the book, which is about advertising. It did not even go in depth with the examples it did have.The book is ok, but not what you think it is.71UU 15 4 LU/\/471("
4,Excellent Product,"I bought two Boos boards for my husband who cooks at home every day. They have been perfect for all of the vegetables and fruit that we prepare. The two laid side-by-side create an excellent work surface/space. They look nice if you want to leave them out. Theses boards are also great as they will not dull knives. I gave only 4 stars however, because both boards were very dry when they arrived and have required multiple coats of mineral oil. The last Boos board I bought did not have this problem; we oiled it only after several hand-washes.Overall, we are very satisfied with the cutting boards. They are definitely superior to other wooden boards. And they last a very long time."
2,John Boos 24 by 18 Maple Cutting Board is a Disappointment!!,I am very disappointed with this board. It is my third John Boos cutting board and in no way does it measure up to the previous two.The cutting surface is consistently rough. My husband has smoothed it with fine grain sandpaper twice and I have oiled the surface several times with John Boos' Boos Block Board Cream to no avail. What is really annoying to me is that I have contacted the company on their customer service website and have not received the courtesy of a reply.John Boos Commercial Maple Cutting Board: 24 x 18 x 1-1/2
1,Quality not as expected,"John Boos boards are generally well regarded, but the 20 by 15 board is lacking. The edge grain blocks are only 7/8"" wide, as opposed to 1 3/4"" width on the 24 by 18 boards. The narrower blocks means more glue is used (which is bad for knives) and it has more areas where splits can occur.Even after similar care as my John Boos 24 by 18 boards and my BoardSMITH board, the 20 by 15 started to split. I'm ordering a BoardSMITH board as its replacement."
2,"smells OK, but does not replicate new car smell very closely",This is a perfectly good air freshener. But it doesn't smell like a new car much at all. I think it smells more like cologne. So I'm overall disappointed.
2,Disappointing.,"It's cute, it's comfortable, but it's a disappointing waste of money. The microphone boom is too short to reach my mouth and pick up sound sufficiently, and after a mere 12 hours of use, I'm already getting crackling noises in the ear piece, probably because of a loose connection between the cord and ear piece. Absolutely disappointing."
2,Not a fan,"I bought these for my husband because he likes pleated pants and I thought the cool fabric would be nice in the warmer weather. He absolutely hated these pants, although they did look good on him. He said the fabric felt uncomfortable, like polyester and they weren't cool at all."
3,Better than stock.,"For the price (and that I had a burnt-out lamp anyway) the performance is good. Just know that if you have HID or have converted to them, these will pale in comparison. Still make a nice bright addition as fog lights, which was my application."
3,"For Gergiev Fans Only, Tchaikovsky Fans Look Elsewhere","In a nutshell, this was a big disappointment. See the review in the April issue of Gramophone for an excellent summation of this recording. If you are a big fan of this conductor, or you are looking to buy your first recording of this work, then you will probably enjoy this issue. However, the interpretation and performance does not come close to that of Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic on Chandos. The electricity and emotional content of Jansons' performance is unsurpassed on modern (i.e., digital) recordings. The sound quality of the Philips disc is OK. It is too closely miked (and too many mikes) so that you clearly hear all of the excessive breathing sounds from Gergiev."
2,spicy dodo,When it first came out I'm sure it was pretty out stuff but in these times it just sucks the company even when under so yeah this one is a no no.
2,"Good for analog, but my d-pad doesn't seem to work.","This is a good gamepad if you are looking to use the analog control. I bought this and plugged it in immediatly and tried to play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (tm) with it, and the d-pad wouldn't function correctly. Its great for racing games and stuff like that, but if you want to use the d-pad, get a different controller with a d-pad that waorks."
2,BEWARE,"When I bought this gamepad I had to admit that the feel of the controller is very comfortable with almost all the buttons in just the right places (the buttons on the shoulders were a little high). However, there is one major flaw with the pad--the ""digital"" d pad. The size and shape of the d pad was uncomfortable enough to use, as it is too small and the arrow buttons are clearly undefined, but the response was even worse. It seemed like I either had to pound or push very, very hard on either of the directional buttons to get a response. To say the least, if your a fan of emulation or games that require good accurate use of direction from a digital d pad don't buy this pad."
4,Mikasa Garden Harvest Mug 15oz,Received these mugs in perfect condition and well packed. Love the Garden Harvest range and bought these to add to my Dinner Set. Very robust and good for soups on a cold Winters night.
2,Beginners Only,"My only problem with this board is that they shouldn't say it's for advanced riders. I've been riding for 25+ years and have owned a skate shop for the last 4 years so I know my product pretty well. The deck is made of birch. It's cheaper, weaker, and doesn't have the same ""pop"" as maple. It's also very narrow for anyone but a pre-teen rider (7.62""). The trucks and wheels are made of the cheapest grade materials so they don't have the same feel and won't last as long or hold up to the same abuse as better brands.That said, it's a little better then the Tony Hawk boards at Walmart and would work for a kid to learn with. Just don't expect a good skater to be stoked on it."
1,Take This Out In The Garbage!,"Don't even waste your cash. What was Labtec making? Drek! Poor voice recognition. Low sound reception. Then, even worse, an awkward on / off switch. Instead I suggest the high performance Logitech 980130-0403 Premium USB 300 Headset."
1,Didn't work for me,"Maybe it's just me, but for some reason I could not get this cable to work on my TV. When I plugged it in to the Wii, the quality was worse. There was snow on the screen and I could barely make out the screen. I thought the cables were defective, so I contacted the company (who have great customer support, by the way) and they sent me another one right away. Unfortunately, this one did the same thing. Another call, another cable... another headache. It could be that my TV just doesn't like this cable."
4,The Nintendo Wii has never looked so good!,"I was very happy when these cables arrived at my home. I quickly dropped all I was doing to hook up these cables to my HDTV. SO far my experience has been incredible. But of course, there are always bad things, well, just about anything. Yes, these cables are cheap, that is one of the reasons I had a bit of a bad feeling of these cables. Everything does look better, and I can experience playing any Wii game in better quality. However, there are a few vertical ""buzzy"" lines that attack the top and middle of my screen randomly. But only appear every hour to two hours. It doesn't seem to much of a big deal so far, but I fear it may wear down in time. Incase of it doing such a thing, I do plan to get newer cables, probably from Nintendo. But however, if you're just looking for some cheap cords that enhance your Wii experience, then these are the cables you really should start out with!"
1,Poorly made,"Don't be like me and buy this despite all the bad reviews. After about 15 minutes of being plugged in the color on my tv turned a greenish hue. I checked all the connections and realized I had to jiggle the cord at the back of the wii to get it to look right; it only worked for about 20 minutes before I had to do it again. I have no problem with the composite cables that came with the system, and will be switching back. Very disappointing."
4,Definitely helps Wii Video Quality,These were great for getting a little better video quality out of the Wii. Cables have good length to them.Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the first one I got had a dead color cable. (Which seems to be an issue with this brand). Amazon promptly sent a new set of cables which worked flawlessly and the price was very reasonable.**EDIT**Just an update. Be careful with the plug that goes into the back of the Wii. After a few times of plugging in/out the actual plug fell apart and got stuck in the Wii. Luckily I was able to get it out with pliers; and ordered a new one that is working good. Just make sure to handle with care or if you are one to remove this cable often; you might be better off paying a little more for a more sturdy cable.
1,PURE GARBAGE,I PURCHASED THESE CORDS AND TRIED THEM NOT ONE BUT TWO HD TVS GUESS WHAT GOT TERRIBLE RESULTS ON BOTH TVS. MY RCA HAD LINES RUNNING UP AND DOWN SCROLLING THE SCREEN. ALSO COLOR WAS COMPLETE TRASH. ON BOTH THE VIZIO AND RCA. AND THE VIZIO TV ALSO HAD THAT ANOYING BUZZING SOUND IVE READ ABOUT. I DONT SEE HOW ANYONE HAS SUCCESS WITH THESE THINGS. I CANNOT RECOMMEND.
4,does what it says,good in 480p. not a huge difference but definetely noticable. not worth $30. maybe 5-15 dollars
2,PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE BUYING !!,"I was very surprised when the cable arrived in a timely manner. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I RATED THEM A TWO. The first day, the cable work near perfectly. The picture was so vivid and crisp on my television; the true definition of HD. A week later, I made the mistake of unplugging to cables from my television to use the DVD player. When I plugged them up again, the picture had all sorts of weird colors; they no longer gave the clear picture as it did when I FIRST plugged them in.BOTTOM LINE: There is a reason why the cost is so low. These are VERY CHEAP and VERY FRAGILE cables. If you want to still buy them, fine. But, once you unplug them from the television, do not expect them to work perfectly again. I would suggest buying cables that are a little more expensive, but have more longevity (just in case you need to unplug them or switch television sets)."
1,Did not work with Wii U,"Tried it with Wii U, picture was black and white rather than color, returning it. Don't know if not compatible with Wii U or got a bad cable."
5,it is what it is,"Not bad for a few bucks. You're not getting true HD out of this, but you shouldn't expact that. The brights are slightly brighter. I had to have it to hook the WII up to my sound system. Again, it doesn't deliver surround sound, but it's a heckuva lot better than coming out of the tv."
2,Those 14 pages go quick,"The illustrations are not very cute, the text is a bit too simple and the book is over before you know it. Unless you are a die hard paddingtion fan - just move on."
3,sports talk ramble,"Not a compelling read, but interesting, nonetheless. Only,on page 150 or so, you wonder: ""Didn't I read this before?""Zeroing-in on various big-name SportsTalk hosts reveals acertain sameness one after the other, page after page.Some interesting insight into the technique of ""talk radio""is magnetic. A good, quick read."
1,A listerner's one hour interviews,"As a fan of sports radio, and someone with intimate knowledge of the key players, the business and the politics I was disappointed to find little or no mention of those elements in this book. The author clearly identifies himself as a listener turned interviewer and barely shares anything provactive or interesting. Chapters are dedicated to major personalities, but Mr. Eisenstock spends too little time either with the individuals or with the subject matter. Further, I found his discourse slightly pessimistic and disrespectful of those he interviewed in basic humane terms. The language and tone was spoiled.The book and subject have depth potential, not tapped by Mr. Eisenstock."
2,ghost in machine type of random noises poor printing of heavy stock paper,"Good price for printing on normal paper but found that it jams on almost EVERY single heavy stock paper, for example, lots of trouble printing my business cards. Machine randomly rolls the ink cartridges and spooks people who aren't expecting it!! My old HP color laserjet 4550 was a better quality machine: rarely jammed, easy to get to paper routes when it did jam-- cons: most expensive inks, replacement inks in the market... damned if you do, damned if you don't."
1,sometimes works,"Does not work most of the time. Flashes red and green after the garage door is closed, shoud show green. Moved it several times, still does not work properly"
2,perhaps good for 2 doors but not 3,"Though this is supposed to handle up to 4 doors, it would not work with 3 doors. The customer service support, though polite, were just plain terrible in terms of working with me on trying to figure out what was wrong. Any time all 3 doors were open and then any 2 were closed, the unit signaled that all 3 were closed. Customer service would tell me they'd test and follow up, but they never did. I had to contact their engineers in Chicago myself since they would not do it. It's been an amazing time expenditure on my part on something that seems so simple. I've tried 3 completely different new sets of equipment and all had the same problem. So far, I am waiting to hear back from the engineers. Their sense of customer service seems better at this point."
1,Garage Door Monitor,This unit did not work and i was told to replace the batteries at my expense. I sent it back and i had to pay the return mail.I do not recommend this unit.
4,Fun indie humor,"While not exactly a masterpiece, Scurvy Dogs is an always entertaining and clever series. The writing is similar in many ways to that of Adult Swim cartoons or popular webcomics, but always manages to be unpredictable and un-cliche in its own way. The art isn't spectacular, but personally I feel it adds to the comic, if it were too well drawn the art would clash with the slapdash, pop culture slant of the writing. Definetly recommended."
5,"Attention, you're buying A spark plug, not a set","I bought this item thinking about a 4pcs set, but I received just A spark plug. It isn't clear enough? or it is?The spark plug should be nice, but I don't know until buy 3 more"
5,Best CD to Play for Background / Mood / Public / Entertaining,"My title sounds strange, yes, but I had no idea how to describe this CD in only a few words. This CD can play all day without anyone in the store or house tiring of the sound. Each time I entertain I play it, and I'm always asked for the title of the CD. I finally just bought 5 CD's on Amazon and now I can hand out this CD instead of writing down the title for guests.The CD has a mix of music, rain and thunderstorms, and a mood that lasts over 19 minutes long in one entire stretch of CD.I highly recommend this CD if you want something to play in the background all day (or for hours) without getting stressed or bored of the music.Enjoy!"
2,Not enough information,My law professor had us buy this book. He is excellent criminal defense lawyer . . . maybe he was trying to save us money because I've since found books that are much better. Price and brevity are the only two things I positively say.
1,Couldn't be worse,"This game is horrible! The racing is extremely slow, the handling is horrible, and the graphics are even worse... There is one cool part of the game though. The freestyle mode is pretty cool, although there are only three tracks so it gets old and boring really quick. If you really like supercross, buy a Playstation & Jeremy McGrath's game before you even consider buying this one."
1,Needs fixing,"I agree with "" Suzie"" the game needs fixing,this wasn't expected by me, because other Phantom games in this category, i have enjoyed immensely.For one thing it loads so much more slowly. sometimes at a snail's pace. The worst thing is you can't really control the mouse arrow, you wind up playing games you didn't intend to play. I have yet to reach the menu, in the upper right hand corner. IN fact it is so annoying, i am playing previous phantom and masque games. She is rught, they seem to be out to lunch in supplying help."
1,Real Deal Slots Bonus Media is a rip-off,"After purchasing this software, I was unable to install it on my computer because of a fatal error. I have tried unsuccessfully twice to contact the software manufacturer Phantom FX to get replacement CD's. Needless to say, I have no idea if this is a fun game to play or not."
1,I wish it worked,"I purchased this game as a Christmas present for my mother this year.I bought it in advance in the beginning of November. As we tried to download it on her computer X-mas morning, we realized that the software was defectiveIT DOES NOT WORK!!!!! We have sinced consulted several people who are knowledgeable and all say it is the software that is the problem. Since I purchased it so far in advace, I can not get any type of refund...JUST SAY NO NO TO THIS GAME!!!!"
2,very dissatisfied!,"i like the design on the bracelet but found the band to very flimsy and pliable. It wasn't what i expected. I thought because it's sterling silver that it would be as strong as my other bracelet...not the case at all. Also, the locket with time wouldn't latch onto the clasp. I'm truely disappointed. It's not worth the money unless you don't mind wasting money."
5,Really Good for Direct To Video,"A lot of mixed reviews yet it's hard to believe this was a direct to video movie with the two big name actors in it and being as good as I thought it was but guess you are seeing more of that nowadays with more movies being released that way. Was quite original as well and never got bored watching it, kept my attention well from start to end, nice story to it as well. I am not a big Morgan Freeman fan but liked his role here very much. Would highly recommend it to any movie fan who likes suspense, drama, or action.Peter J. Miller"
4,Morgans midas touch,"Again if M. Freeman is in the movie, it is bound to be a keeper. He is so good in this move, he could or should have been a Bond Man."
5,I like it...,"I love this movie. John Cusack's character could have been developed a bit more but other than that it is a great thriller/drama. There is a nude scene and language that keeps it from being a family film.By the end of this movie, the assasin as definitely met his match!"
2,Boring and repetitive....,"A mildly interesting game up to the first twelve levels. After that, it's just more of the same. Combine that with bad AI and poor graphics and all you're left with is crappy game that needlessly sucks up valuable time."
3,DERIVATIVE CRIME DRAMA,"Originally called SOMETIMES A HERO in its initial release, this somewhat diverting entertainment is passable. Josh Barker plays a small time hood who decides to go straight but not before he ticks off a crime lord played by Paul Coufos. Barker's partners, including a somewhat loony Bryan Genesse, aren't sure he's doing the right thing but the main reason is Barker's interest in an ice skating coach (Christina Cox). The job he turns down involves blowing up the skating arena where his new love's sister is hoping to acquire a tour as a professional skater. Barker must also contend with his love's psychotic stepfather and an old nemesis (played with awful relish by Darren Shalavi). Typical car crashes and explosions heighten the slower pace of the film, but Barker and Cox make an interesting couple, so you could do worse."
4,Good Sturdy Tripod for the money,"I purchased this tripod for photography and astrophotography. So far this is stable enough for my uses, and the price is low enough not to wince too much buying it. I did have a question that i called celestron for, that was if there was a set of drive motors for easier searching for the shot i am looking for. So, for anyone that is not happy with the condition or the way it arrived call celestron they were interested in my feed back and wanted to help with any concern i had that could be hashed out. As for stability i will be using weights to help hold and stabilize the tripod with my 102mm scope and my canon t2i."
1,Damaged Goods,"On reciept of the tripod, I found it wrapped and packed (on the outside)in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product. When I opened the box, I found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box. There was minimal packing around the tripod itself, mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching, and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around. I have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping. Also, if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company, instructions are not part of their package."
1,Not recommended,"This is a transfer from a scratchy 33 1/3 r.p.m. vinyl album, which is obvious from the start-- and no attempt has been made to remove the scratches. And then, after listening to a couple of movements of the first concerto, there it is: the record skips. You've gotta love the Italian digital transfer ""engineers"" who pulled off this stunt. Shame. Gioconda de Vito deserves better."
2,From the Dancing Brush,"I was rather disappointed in this DVD. Too simplistic and amateurish. I was expecting more helpful and useful tips. Good for Middle School and below, but not for serious art lovers.The Dancing Brush"
1,Barbie Race and Ride,"We purchased the Play Station with the intent of having games for our boys and girls, but this was a big disappointment. Our daughters (ages 6 and 4) were bored with the game in less than 15 minutes. Now they play Driver and 007 and can just about beat their brothers. I'd love to see Barbie as a secret agent or trying to out-drive the bad-guys in her pink corvette...then I think you'd see the boys even wanting to play!"
3,Pretty Good,I'll explain my 3 star rating by reviewing each cartoon separately:Quacker Tracker: DThis was made when cartoon budgets were at an all time low. Plus most of the creative talent from their great years were elsewhere.Double or Mutton: B+Great Wolf and Sheepdog outing.Feline Frame-Up: A+This collection earns 3 stars for this cartoon alone. One of the best cartoons Chuck Jones has ever done.8 Ball Bunny: ABugs rescues a penguin. You can tell Bugs is just walking through this one.A Fractured Leghorn: A+A great Foghorn Leghorn cartoon.Scaredy Cat: A-Porky and Sylvester stay in a house with mice trying to murder them.Louvre Come Back to Me: B+Pepe Le Pew is an excellent character but the jealous boyfriend element in this one slows things down rather than sparking new chemistry.
3,Review,"They work OK. You may find it necessary to grind this plier's tips to suit your preferences, other than that it is OK."
5,GOOD TEXT TO ACTUALLY LEARN OOP FROM!!!,"This book was a great addition to my programming library. I bought the book to learn the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and this book makes it clear and concise. Many other books on OOP try to oversell you on why rather than how to code it. This book is good at `how' and shows many coding examples in C++ and Java. It even has some C# in it.You'll learn all about polymorphism, interfaces, abstraction and much more. If you're having trouble understanding OOP in your Java or C++ text book, get ""OOP DeMYSTiFieD."""
5,"A great book : an facinating proximity with Skinner ""Mind IS behavior"" applied to Relaxation","Of course, this is not a recent book. However...In this book, the founder of Scientific Relaxation give fascinating explanations on what's behind relaxation techniques. If you're interrested by Edmund Jacobson works and want to understand the biological mechanisms ( sometimes ""not far from"" phylosophical ) that could explain why relaxation is so powerful as theurapeutic adjunct for anxiety, depression or ""stress"" related disorders, or, simply as a mean of increasing the quality of our daily lives, this is, in my opinion a book you'll like."
1,Flight of Fancy,"For a book reportedly written by someone with a degree in history this work widely misses the mark. In many cases the author races and leaps off the cliff of logic with little regard for the facts. The book is also riddled with errors in the chronology of historical and prehistorical events. While some of her ideas are interesting, they are little more than the personal day dreams of this author. There is no surprise that this book was not published by a scholarly press."
4,"A great book, but much is written as theory.","I really enjoyed this book, Ann Moura has done a great deal of research throughout her life on this subject and has come up with a very believable theory backed up by a great many known historical events. Most of what she says is believable and based truly, but some parts, like the Dravidian culture's advancements aren't backed up by any evidence, she just claims that these people understood the atomic structure, light speed, and other things our culture has only ""discovered"" in the past 100 years. While it is possible that this happened... I would like some examples."
5,Great Deep House Mix!,"This disc has a steep import pricetag, but it's well worth the bucks. Farley crafts an absolutely stupefying array of deep house grooves. Many tracks have vocals, but they're not the run-of-the-mill diva screaming. Some tracks have the kind of deep male ""oooh sexy"" vocals of which I'm not a big fan--but it really works for me here. If you like deep house sounds, this disc will get you moving!"
1,Bunch of Nonsense,"The coach comes across as an egomaniac; a My Way or the Highway type. There is no real detail as to some of the inexplicable decisions made at TC Williams. Why did Hammond keep losing Students to TC? Boundary Change? Would the Boundaries change every year? If Herman Boone was the Head Coach at TC, why would the School Board bring in Bill Yoast as a replacement? Why was he then replaced by Boone. The cover Photo does not look like TC's field to me. Is it? Why weren''t the obvious mistakes in the Movie addressed. Just 1: Gary Bertier was killed in the off season , not after a game. Anyone wanting an explanation of errors in the movie I suggest you visit the Internet."
1,"Rot, Mold, and Termites","If you like black and white illustrations of problems, with captions warning against rot, mold, and termites, buy this book. If you are looking for lists of negative things to be on the lookout for, buy this book. Dismal and very anti-DIY, this book mainly says, don't fix it yourself - definitely call a pro every time. There are better choices for DIY reading out there."
4,Strong Wheels -,"I got both front and rear wheels for about the price of a replacement rim, and spokes the local bike shops would charge, and then I would of needed to take the time to build the wheels.I currently have about a 1,000 miles of city pavement on these wheels, and they are still true. If you need 630 or 27 inch wheels, you will be pleased at the difference a set new set of wheels will make on your older bicycle.MT"
4,Suzuki Service Manual,Nice book in decent shape. It will help out a lot in restoring an old bike I recently purchased.
2,Dissapointing,"First, this book is copyright 1997, and six years is a heck of a long time in this industry. Second, the book makes almost no reference to vehicle applications, which are a very important CAN applications and in fact where CAN started. For example there is no mention of SAE J1939 heavy truck bus standard, which is CAN based, and J1850 appears only once."
1,WARNING,"Apart from the usual disclaimer for software, that the software may not work at all it reads 'Springer-Verlag or, its designee, has the right to audit your computer and electronic component usage to determine whether any unauthorised copies of this package have been made.' This is unacceptable and it means I have not been able to look at the software, apparently a CAN simulator that accompanies the book."
3,battery life isn't what its cracked up to be,"Just purchased this dvd player and was disappointed that the fully charged battery kept dying after 2 hours at medium brightness. I called panasonic and they said that I have to significantly lower the brightness to even get more time. Needless to say I travel quite a bit on airlines and therefore unless I spend $100+ to get another battery with more time I will not get the quality and time that I expected. I bought this based upon reviews and especially for its battery life. However, on the plus side the images are clear and its nice to have the adjustable screen."
4,"Panasonic DVD-LS80 8.5"" Portable DVD Player",This DVD player gives a very good picture and the sound of the DVD's is excellant.
3,Disappointed!,"After a thorough reserach on portable DVD players, I bought the Panasonic DVD-LS80 primarily because they have pretty good reviews. Was pretty impressed with the picture quality and the anti-skip protection. A remote control could have been a good addition, especialy for the price.The regretful decision to purchase this DVD player however came when the audio speakers gave up on me...it just went ""dead"" and i was forced to use headphones all the time in order to use the player which was a major inconvenience. Also, as was pointed out in the other reviews, you don't get 6hours of battery life as promised, more like 3hours."
1,No wonder the price is only...,"Now, Im not one to give out 1 star to just anything. I have bought many items through Amazon since around 2000 or so, but this one earned every point. First of all, the sword was discolored when I recieved it. It appeared to have a light yellow color to it. Next, the chain was too short. Even if you have a pencil neck, this chain would probably strangle you. Next, the elegant case was a cheap piece of plastic. Needless to say, this one went into the trash a few days after I recieved it."
2,Informative but incredibly boring,"This book is full of great information. Unfortunately, it's written for people who don't need it. The style of the book is SO boring, it must be written for parents, not teens. I'm sure there are better books that speak to teens, not just lecture them."
2,Would have been a good gift,I ordered this for my aunt last christmas. I placed the order in November. The week before christmas I still had not received it. I called the company to find that it was on back order and it wouldn't be in until after christmas. I promptly cancelled my order and bought a gift elsewhere. They gave me no problems when I cancelled my order as they failed to notify me that the item was on backorder.
2,"Good Looking Display Stand, But...","This Traditions Loading and Display Stand looks good, but is made of very lightweight wood and has a flimsy hinge.It is usable as a loading stand (I tried it) but great care needs to be taken not to put too much pressure on the stand's upright support. This is really not an overly stable solution and doubt it will hold up well if it gets much use.As a display stand, this does work and it looks nice enough, but the lightweight wood still leaves me concerned that it will easily be bumped off the mantel where I wanted to display our Pietta .44 caliber 1858 New Model Army Revolver.I will likely be looking for something else or use this as a pattern to make my own out of sturdier materials.CFH"
1,Quality,"Cheap,Cheap.Cheap. Not sure what kind of wood stand is made of but it's close to Balsa wood in weight. Hinge looks like it was made from tin foil. Bends very easy if any pressure is applied. Will display gun OK but don't try loading gun on stand. Hinge will break right off."
4,Excellent - but not outstanding,"The Baseball Timeline is an excellent book. It is packed with lots of interesting information about the history of baseball listed by calendar day for each year. However, it has two major flaws. One is that it uses the inaccurate Baseball Encyclopedia instead of the much, much more accurate (and OFFICIAL) encyclopedia, Total Baseball. The other flaw is that Solomon's book is very skimpy in details for the 19th. century. In all honesty, I would recommend that readers who REALLY want a day-by-day type outline of baseball history should get The Baseball Chronology (by Charlton) instead."
2,Too perky,"This bra has molded cups; my mistake for looking at the picture & thinking it would give a natural shape! It doesn't look at all like the picture. I personally, have a lot of space between my cups, so when I wear this, I have two empty air pockets really far into the center of my chest. Not a natural looking shape. If you want to look really perky, this works, but the reason I search so hard for my tiny size is so I don't look fake. I can find a bra anywhere if I want to stuff my cups!"
1,Broke at 2nd use...,"A complete waste of money. I should have known since it was so cheap...Unfortunately by the time it broke (the 2nd time I used it) I had already discarded the packaging, invoice, etcetera...so I did not even bother trying to contact the seller, I just went to my local LOWES and HOME DEPOTS where I could see the hammocks in person to choose one of higher quality.This was my third cotton rope hammock, the other two each lasted at least 2 years of heavy usage. You get what you pay for."
2,hammocks,"The products arrived in timely fashion, in good shape.The material isn't holding up well. It has only beena little over a month, and both hammocks arelossing strength. They dont get used much, butthey are starting to look like cats play with them,a bit of sarcasim.R. Bunker"
3,Not as enjoyable as hoped for,"We were excited to find a hammock at such an affordable price. After using it a few times we understand why it is rather cheap. The hammock is not so easy to get in to, sags with the weight even of my youngest daughter (age 6 - 45 lbs), and the ropes spread creating gapping holes. Sure, one can stand there trying to minimize the gaps, but isn't that work? I thought the idea of a hammock was to kick back and relax.My wife and I are happy to have the hammock but next season we are thinking we will replace with a higher quality one."
4,Ocean Shore,"I have this recording, too. I like to sit in the house (it's HOT in Texas!) with the ceiling fan on, my soy candle that smells like suntan lotion burning, this recording, and a book. It's awesome. Relaxing,too."
2,The Amazing Spider-Man,"Horrible movie...doesn't even compare to the Tobey Maguire series and I don't like Tobey Maguire. Yes, the special effects were better but everything else was sup-par. A movie need more than special effects to make it good."
1,Stick with the original.,"Since I didn't get the chance to see this is the theaters I bought this when it came out. My god this is a terrible film. two hours of my life I'm never getting back.If you already have the original, don't waste your money on this atrocious dvd."
1,Sucked,"This movie was awful. I expected it to suck, but it was way worse than my lowest expectation. Do not buy."
3,"despite a few things, one being a massive flaw, great movie","this is my first review ever so bare with me if it sucks: while i was massively put off by the lizards goomba-ish look, emma stone being cast as gwen(or rather gwen being in there at all considering what happens to her in the original books)and ben NOT SAYING HIS BEST KNOWN LINE ""with great power comes great responsibility"" i found this to be an incredible adaptation of the original comic book......i just hope for gwens sake they dont put green goblin in the sequel......"
3,Stale,"A pointless reboot ... a waste of time retelling Spiderman's origin .. action wasn't great .. the Lizard was meh .. Spidey's outfit was a letdown .. i just didn't come way excited about having seen another Spiderman movie .. it was more just a feeling of ""this was really unnecessary"". it did nothing that the previous films hadn't already done.oh well just my opinion .. i wouldn't waste my time on the Bluray even for the figurines."
1,Cheesy!,Just too cheesy! I really did not like this version of Spider-Man! Oh well maybe next time they will get it right!
2,Very bad movie..,"This was a very bad movie. It was just very weak in every way, but especially in the writing. I'm a big fan of the earlier Spiderman movies, but this one was so bad I just watched about half and gave up. Don't waste your time!"
3,Movie,The movie was ok but there is not much different between the other spiderman the only different is instead of paper it was a cop
1,Misleading info on Digital copy,"Great movie and actually one of my favorites, but this does not have a true digital copy for download. Forces a none PC user to make a Sony account, load Microsoft Silverlight, then load Sony download software which Apple will not let run, since it is not compliant to their requirements of vendor code. Extremely disappointed how this was packaged and misleading in what I thought I was purchasing."
5,THE BEST,Great combination of the 3-D Blu-ray movie plus collectable statues of Spiderman and the Villan. As an Limited Edition it's outstanding!
2,Little action/more a love story,"There was very little action until the end of the movie. If you want more of a love story and the in depth look at the backround of the Peter Parker, go for it. If you like action and cool special effects, don't bother."
3,"Good, not great","It's better than the last two spiderman movies with Toby in the red suit, but has it's own issues. This is a teen movie under the guise of a superhero flick. Parker's problems stem more from his relationship with Gwen Stacy than the loss of his parents or uncle which seemed to be thrown in just to keep with canon rather than being a real plot element. Sally Field, with all of her acting prowess couldn't make Aunt May seem to be anything more than an enabler to Parker's ""dangerous"" choice to be Spiderman. Most people won't be looking for depth in a movie like this, so I give it three star, but with all of the characters being two dimensional cliches I don't see this becoming the classic superhero film Avengers and Dark Knight rises will be."
2,Felt FLAT and MECHANICAL,"This was a ""nice try"" but seriously fell flat. Parts simply dragged on and the acting was rather poor. I won't go on and on with all the flaws and lack of depth compared to the previous movies which, are now even more of a shining beacon compared to this movie. (except the 3rd one which was garbage) I dare say this remake was even 'Cheesy' geared to the 10 to 15 y.o. teen target audience. I'm glad others loved this movie. I still have the previous movies to enjoy that much more now. Sorry, no true comparison IMO. Perhaps in another five years, yet ANOTHER reboot will get pumped out with lots of CGI and 3D effects for the mass to eat up. Peter slamming his alarm clock and smashing it into pieces was most likely the ONLY hilarious part of the ENTIRE flick. Well, at least that alone gave me a good laugh. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer was more inventive and unique than this movie. Yawn. Sigh. Shrug."
1,The Amazing Spiderman,"Was Hoping for an improvement on the Toby McGuire movies but there was no such thing. It was like watching a spiderman version of the first twilight movie, extremely cheesy and and awful acting."
5,Really enjoyed it.,Gave this product as a Christmas gift. The part called me and told me how much they enjoyed it. I'm not attracted to movies like this but I did not purchase it for myself.
2,boring,"Nothing new here from the last one. I found myself very bored and not interested in the characters or their problems. I normally love Emma Stone, but in this she was incredibly milquetoast."
3,Rehash,"if this was the first Spiderman movie I might have thought it was a good story, but it was too similar to the previous movie."
3,Not So Much...,"Special effects were great. However, this departure from the original storyline does not work for me. I recommend that anyone interested in this movie should wait for it to come to Amazon Prime."
1,I don't know what to say,"I loved the Tobey Maguire versions. I hate this reboot and I'm glad that I didn't waste $11.75 to see it in the movies. Hollywood has been putting out so much drivel of late that I'm perfectly willing to wait several months to rent movies on Amazon, iTunes, etc. since I save money, time, etc."
2,Disappointed,"We have all the past Spiderman movies and were reluctant to get this one, but our son suggested we should claiming it to be ""great"". Well we couldn't have been more disappointed and bored. Doesn't hold a candle to the previous Spiderman movies. Way too much time wasted on developing a ""love story"" between Peter Parker and his girlfriend (not Mary Jane)rather than focusing on some kind of story. Both primary actors were lacking in character development skills. Sally Field was anything but the kind Aunt. Martin Sheen actually did a good job as his uncle, but that was about it. I would definately rent this one before purchase; wish we had."
3,Movie Rental,The movie was good and download worked great. Will not use again due to the cost. Will wait until the movie comes out on Netflix.
4,Excellent Movie,"I had seen the earlier Spider Man movies and enjoyed them. Although, I don't buy many DVDs or Bluray anymore because I enjoy the movies on amazon prime instaview, I bought this one because of the 3D. The story was good, the acting was good and the 3D effects were good."
5,Awesome!!!,The movie is in excellent shape. Brand new. My nephew is going to love it for Christmas!! Thank you very much!
3,Not Bad,Not a bad movie. Not in the class of the previous Spiderman movies. Being a comic collector from way back. I never really like the changes.
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,"I loved this. Compared to the previous trilogy featuring Toby Maguire, this blew it out of the park. I am familiar with The Amazing Spiderman story-line and I cannot wait to see what they do with it."
3,didn't happen like that,"this movie ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was so0o0o0o0 much different then the comic.difference#1: neck bitedifference#2: no marry-janedifference#3: man made web(s)difference#4: NOT secrete identitydifference#5: not a geek/no newspaperdifference#6: no shy romantic angel"
1,This was really bad!,"This is like The Twilight version of Spider-Man, I liked the other ones. This show didn't even get started until half way through. Then they kept going back to some idiotic teen angst crap. The lizard guy was kinda cool though! Spider-Man is supposed to be a sarcastic, callous type superhero. Not a dramatic haircut in boots. Boo this flim."
3,Good but not great,slow at times and maybe a little on the corny side. My son who is 9 loved the movie though
3,okay movie,felt characters were not well developed. spiderman character was the only exception. we felt he portrayed being a teen very well.
1,Absolutely horrible,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The writing is pedantic, the pace is uneven, the acting is horrible and it is absolutely nothing new in a story that has been beaten to death. I actually shut it off about 3/4 of the way through, unable to bear it for a moment longer. This movie is a complete insult to the viewing public and is clearly just a money grab. I would strongly recommend you steer clear of this movie, it isn't even worth a RedBox 1 dollar rental! If your IQ is over about 70, you are going to feel seriously insulted if you bother to waste your time watching this dung.And yes, they tried to inject Twilight-esque teen romance into it, which was the absolute spit in the eye that made me turn it off.I'm actually angry that I wasted my precious time on this tripe. If Hollywood can't produce anything better than this, then I think I might just sell my BlueRay player and just read books for entertainment. Bad job."
3,ok - first half is good,the first half was good cinema. The second half was trying to be a special effects spectacle and lost all heart
3,Meh?,"The movie was OK, but it moved rather slow. I really think the first two movies were better, but this was definitely better than the third one."
4,The Spide,"A different versional twist of a great story. I think I still liked the original version somewhat more though Overall, not bad."
2,OK but the Tobey Maguire Series was Much Better,"I have been a huge fan of super hero films and TV for a long time. Spiderman has always been my favorite. After the amazing job done on the Spiderman 1, 2 and 3 films with Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about this one. I was right. You can't improve on perfection. So what did they do? They reinvented the whole story. That alone should offend long-time fans. In addition, Andrew Garfield was seriously miscast. He is just not believable in the role nor does he look the part. Tobey Maguire took the role seriously, bulking up to play the super strong web-slinger. In this version, (slightly) padded suits and CGI did it all. I managed to get through it once but it is not worthy of a second viewing. Maybe this version is best left to kids who have no history with The Amazing Spiderman."
3,it wasnt that good,"after watching the first two, i had high expectations but was pretty disappointed. nice special effects, but the movie did not impress me at all..."
1,what a waste. boring.,"I do prefer the lead Spider Man Whats-his-face in this film over the other whats-his-face but this movie was BORING! POINTLESS! AWKWARD!The Villian was barely in the movie and even less as the LIZARD but nonetheless, I do like that actor.The first half was exactly like the SAM RAIMI version up until the uncle dies but only WAAAAAAY LONGER!ALL THE GREAT ACTION SCENES WERE IN ALL THE TRAILERS (IMPLYING THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE ACTION IN THE MOVIE)!NEXT TIME SONY, REDEEM YOURSELF BY PAYING WILLEM DAFOE WHATEVER HE WANTS TO CAMEO IN THE CLOSING CREDITS AS A SICK, BED RIDDEN NORMAN OSBOURN!"
3,Meh,"I miss Sam Rami. It was just too soon to try to do this, and then the plot isn't as involved as it could have been. Give me spiderman 1 or 2 over this any day."
4,Best Spidey yet (and true to the comics),"Garfield (finally) brings to life the smack-talking Spidey of the good old days! Good chemistry with Emma Stone, although, at times, feels out of place. The movie sometimes loses its way, but manages to tell a good tale at the end of it. Plus, some great iconic shots of Spidey in pose! Good times."
4,Spiderman,"a very good movie, I think I like it better than the earlier trilogy. nice speciel effects. i'll watch it again"
5,Nice Movie,"Great 3D Movie thats all have to say, Quality good, nice to have spider man collection in movies or in toys."
3,Meh,"Like quite a few others, I felt this reboot was kind of pointless. The previous trilogy is (for the most part) excellent and still fresh in our minds. This reboot doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Yes, the special effects are great and the 3D works well, but the previous trilogy still looks great, too. I have to admit that after seeing the trailers for this, I wasn't terribly excited to see it. They highlighted a lot of the corny humor from the movie and it didn't bode well to me. It turned out to be slightly better than I was expecting, but still rather forgettable. I didn't care much for the characters, especially the villain, which doesn't even really come across as a villain - just some monster that Spiderman has to take care of on his way to figuring out who he is. But the ride was still kind of fun."
3,A Shadow of its Former Glory,"I am a huge Marvel fan and I loved ow the Amazing Spider-Man kept close to the plot of the comics. However, the original film of Spider-man was superior in both plot and character. Of course, the Amazing Spider-Man has better special effects but sometimes that's not the most important thing in films."
1,This review is only about the 3d/ Movie was just ok,Just wanted to point out that I do not hate 3D. If its used right it works wonders and when it is not its a BIG waste of time. I own a 3d tv at home and love watching films on it. This Spiderman movie I got to see when it opened over the summer. The film was ok but not great at all. The 3D I have to say was something that could have worked good for this film. I mean why not its Spiderman! But I was very upset when I watched it. Nothing really shot out at you. The 3D was boring and looked flat. Do not waste your time buying this.Movie: C-3D: D
4,A Better Peter Parker,I always hated Toby Maguire as Spider Man. This guy from The Social Network was pretty good. Plot was alright and entertaining.
4,Good,"I love this stuff, especially the stuff it came right on time... And the quality of the goods is also good"
4,amazing spiderman blu ray / 3d,"great value / great collectors item that is packed in this limited edtion packaging , the movie has excellent visual in 3D"
5,Easy to rent the movie we wanted!,"It's so nice to have the option of renting a movie without having to go out to get it, or return it!"
5,3 yr old son is completely excited..,My 3 yr old son loves Spiderman anything. We rented this movie from redbox and he cried when we had to take it back. Was so excited to see it on amazon watch instantly. He has watched it 3 times a day for the last few days!!
3,Good Movie - Disappointed in 3D,"This movie was SO lacking in the use of 3D until the climatic scenes at the end of the movie. For the Spiderman enthusiast this movie would be okay to add to a library. We were not disappointed with the movie, just the use of 3D. We have a wonderful Samsung 60"" HD LED 3D television and have watched a number of movies with great 3D results."
4,the amazing spider man 2012,"I went and seen this as a midnight showing and was dissapointed.This movie should have been picked up where part 3 left off,with spiderman facing a new foe in the lizard.But instead the director took an already popular and successful movie and turned it upside down.Dont get me wrong it was a good movie,actors were good,action was good.The director just chose the wrong path PERIOD!!!Overall i recommend watching if you like spiderman."
2,Biggest problem was the actual character of spiderman himself,"I found myself unable to empathize or even like Spiderman in this film. The dialogue, in particular between Peter and Gwen, was beyond atrocious, unwatchable really. I found myself twinging in discomfort at the awkward nature of their interactions - too much mumbling and stammering in place of actual content. The angsty skater spiderman just didn't seem to have any heart, and that's where I left this interpretation behind. note: I was once a heartless angsty skater teen myself...The ""honest trailer"" [google: 'amazing spiderman honest trailers'] really does an excellent job of explaining exactly what the hugest problems with this movie are."
1,Terrible,There were a couple nice special effects but other than that it was a real sleep inducing flop. Too cutsie for Spiderman. Bad casting in my opininion.
3,Good movie,Not the best hero flick I have seen but it's good enough. I felt that Garfield was a better spidey than Tobey and enjoyed seen Gwen Stacey more than MJ. The villain was a bit weak but it works as a brand new start for the Spider Man franchise.
2,Why is this getting such good reviews?,"Effects: WeakCharacters: WeakerEntertainment: Weaker yetWish I had my rental charge back: You bet'chaSo, before this was released and we were watching the previews in the theater or on TV, everyone was asking ""didn't they just have a trilogy of Spider-Mans like two years ago?"" and ""Why in the world would they remake this AGAIN?""Turns out all those questions were justified, the movie was lame."
2,A little disappointed,I was disappointed because I wasn't able to load this movie. Onto itunes I purchased this movie with digital copy. But I could not download it
2,ehh ok.,I know its based on a different series of spiderman comics. But it just didnt have the enjoyment or moving moments that poor peter parker goes threw. It was just too disappointing.
1,digit copy does not work with iTunes,"the movie is good, UltraViolet is terrible, force you to sign up an account and use their player, don't waste your money with this version"
3,A fresh take on a classic,"I like what they did with the Spiderman story in this one, but I think it came too soon after the previous trilogy."
1,Cinderellas Castle,This book is a waste! I followed the directions they give to get a reservation at Cinderellas Castle for Breakfast. They said to call 60 days in advance at exacly 6:59:40. 3 days I tried this. On the 4th day I tried earlier. I got through! Just to find out that reservations are now taken 90 DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!! This book is out if date and it was the 2005 edition!
3,What was I thinking?,"This book was really unuseful. I was taking my 13 & 10 yr. olds and we had already booked everything so we just needed to know about the park not the plans and stuff. And the index wasn't set up so it was easy to use. We were trying to find out about the resturants but I found that you had to look up each by name, and the reason we brought the book was to find out things like the names. I perferred about books that we bought in addition to this better."
4,WOW! EVERY question is answered,"Buy this book IMMEDIATELY upon thinking of going to Disney...EVERY question is answered. If anything, this book contains TO MUCH INFO.Give yourself enough time to savor the tips and advice, it will make your life a lot easier.You will not be sorry.TIP:Buy some page tabs to mark your favorite points of interest. I bought the .99 colored tabs @ WalMart and they worked great :)"
4,Great guide ! Very useful !,"I spent a lot of time at the library, looking for the book that would really help me planifying my first ""no parents to pay for the trip"" trip to Walt Disney World. And I found what I was looking for !I especially like the way every restaurant is describe, the tips about the fireworks and parades, the ""when to go"" lines in every attraction listed. It is very well organised, and clear. I like the fact that they have included letters from readers, telling their point of view, which often differs from the author's, giving special tips. But, just a point, use the book as a ""give me some ideas"", and not a ""gotta do exactly what they say"". I found some attractions' description too rough, or straight. Try the rides that YOU think you'll like, and jugde for yourself afterwards.Anyway, this is a really well done book, full of nice tips and details. A must-have for anyone who really want to get the most out of their trip."
5,Fantastic. Best ever.,"These guides are dead-on correct. A value at any price.I came across the older versions a few years ago, and was impressed with the reader rating system. We didn't want to admit initially that the ratings system worked...but it does. You will be empowered and know where to get the best bargains for your time, money or appetite.The transportation system can be mind bending at Disney, however these guides put it all into simple to understand language that makes it worth the time to plot a strategy. The hotel information is accurate and the rates are likely to be real and not some 60 day advance purchase scam. Take advantage of this guide and you will have a wonderful trip."
4,save a tree,"Good premise, interesting idea. But this gets just barely 4 stars. This has many good little thrills, but too much banality. Character developement is longwinded. Some good science.Mr. Hewson could have save a tree by trimming about 100 pages of this. Sundog and Gaia sounds like something out of a hippie convention. Speedreaders will get the best advantage here. Some edge thrills but too much placid lame suspense. Good summertime lukewarm read. Just too much 'yada, yada, yada'."
1,NO WONDER THERE ARE ONLY TWO OTHER REVIEWS,"THIS BOOK HAS HIGH POTENTIAL FOR BEING THE BEST SOPORIFIC OF THE YEAR. HEWSON TRIES TO IMITATE CRICHTON'S STYLE, EVEN TO PARAGRAPHING AND CHAPTER STRUCTURE ... BUT FAILS ... REALLY FAILS. I READ SOLSTICE ABOUT TWO PAGES A NIGHT BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP. HOWEVER, JUST GOT TIMELINE BY CRICHTON AND READ HALF OF IT LAST NIGHT. I WOULD GO ON WITH COMMENTS HERE, BUT I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE LAST HALF OF TIMELINE. ANYONE WANT A CHEAP COPY OF SOLSTICE?"
2,Save your money,"Some hippie fruitloops get conrol of ""Sundog"" which is ""Star Wars"" type weapon and decide to destroy all civilization. Well, Okaay. I guess, I could stretch my imagination that far. Enter self-righteous, tree hugging ""scientist"" who is supposed to save the world because he knows a lot about ""Sundog"". How? He used to work on developing it until he realized it would be a weapon. After that he walked away from it. Oh, yeah, I could really see myself getting all sympathetic and teary eyed over it. Big bad goverment, how dare they to build a weapon to defend their country. Boo-hoo. Sarcasm aside, this is a very boring book. Story drags on and on without much excitment. I love sci-fi and natural(and unatural) disaster stories but I suggest avoiding this one at all cost."
1,If you must,"Perhaps the last 1/3 of this this book is good but after wading through the first 2/3 I gave up. Maybe the science is accurate, but I prefer non-fiction over cardboard characters. The dialog is also unbelievable. If the author knows people who communicate this way, then I hope they are in counseling. My advice? Find someone who read it cover to cover and ask them what happened."
4,repetitive,The game is real cool to start but after a while it becomes very repetitive. There are only a limited # of characters and you can only play against the computer in one way. The difficulty is not very difficult as well.
5,BASH HIS SKULL!!!,I HAD GOOD FUN DUBBING MY OPPONENT SATAN AND KNOCKING HIM OUT IN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF A 13 ROUND CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT!!!
3,Can't charge and listen simultaneously,"This charger does charge your zune. The problem is if you are wanting to listen to your zune while charging it. It will play, but there is so much static you can barely hear what's playing."
5,Wanting to know more,"The two women are strong but in different ways. The strongest link they hold is that they are family. Even though they have had there differences, they are still able to find strength in each other. What a wonderful read!I would like to know more about these two!"
1,It ain't jazz!,"I may be unfair, but listening to only two samples, I don't like this band's sound. Like a rock band, the percussion section is overpowering. The melody mmy be okay in another key, but still with the drummers so loud it is hard to make out a melody line. A true test of a jazz recording is ""Does it swing"". This band doesn't. FIRE THE DRUMMERS!!!"
5,good product found,used these before - can't find them locally anymore. great easy to use product. easy to take along on a trip - or even keep in the car.
5,Not high fidelity but heavenly playing and my favorite interpretation,"It is doubtful that Bach expected his music to be played like this but for me this is sheer heavenly playing. I have a dozen recordings and this is the one I gives me the most enjoyment and insight into the music. While the fidelity is not first rate, it is totally acceptable and not at all scratchy. Enjoy!"
2,"Good idea, implementation suffers...","I was excited to have a camcoder device and not bother with any media, so bought this one before our trip to Tahoe. Well, I'm not gonna say it's horrible - may be someone will find it suitable for the purpose but these are my thoughts :good :- very light (i've checked the bag couple of times to see if it's inside, it felt so light.- bright lcd screen- fancy menu- convinient presentation of clips : you see first frames of your footage tiled on the screen - very easy to navigate.bad :- no viewfinder : that mkes it impossible to use in a bright environment- video quality is avg to poor, for example green foliage comes together to a green pixely substance- takes long time to start up- turns off when you close lcd screen (was annoying for me)- digital image stabilizer (doesn't compare to optical one at all...)Once again, it might be suitable for someone, but I'm looking for better wuality, view finder and i guess optical image stabilizer...--V."
3,Consider your computer hardware carefully before purchase,"After buying this product I found out the hard way that the only way this works as advertised is with a fairly new computer, preferable with a media center. I spent many, many, many frustrating hours trying to get the system to work on my 3 year old machine (Windows XP with plenty of memory). In the meantime I loaded the Cyberlink software into my old machine (with Windows 98) just to print out the docs, and the software completly fried the computer. So, we replaced the old computer with a new HP and voila, the camera and software now run as easy as the ads claimed. I think this camera is great, but most likely ahead of the general public's access to the hardware to make it function as it is intended. Unless you have a new system with a media center or are ready to upgrade, I would not recommend purchase."
2,"Geat image quality, software confusing",I lost 6 hours of important video recording while trying to negotiate their very confusing software. I returned the camera.
2,MY LEAST FAVORITE WILLIAMS-SONOMA BOOK,"The reviews published previously were enticing, inviting, yet I found this book to be dull, uninteresting, not up to Williams-Sonoma's standards.""The Joy of Cooking"" has better soup recipes. Save your money and open ""The Joy"" to find what you are looking for. You will not bedisappointed, as I was with this book!"
5,Sublime,"I've made a half dozen soups so far and they are all perfection. They range from the classic to the unusual. My fave discovery: zucchini puree. Who ever knew zucchini, fresh oregano and onion could taste like this? Also love the 3 mushroom soup with sherry. Only suggestions: use less stock than is called for to make soups a little thicker. Don't even buy this book unless you own an immersion blender. I gave my Cuisinart away."
1,5th undimension,I did not recieve none of the songs I wanted only worthless covers of other artists song..I want a refund of my money
5,Great album!,"Viejas Locas is the best band here in Argentina (was, now it's called Intoxicados) and in this album are the most important hits of this great rock and roll band. The other albums are great too! I have them and they are like this one... You really have to buy this... Aguante Viejas Locas!! =D Aguante el Pity!"
3,Star Trek Voyager: Eloguim,"I kind of liked this movie because of the space dwelling life-forms. The rest was really boring. Voyager isn't the place to have children like the Enterprise. The Enterprise-A didn't have any children at all which was a suprise. I haven't watched the orignal TV episodes so maybe they did have children. But not really. But, people have to live with it."
5,So Good It'll Make You Wonder,"You'll be so captivated by the plot, you'll want the story to go on after it's finished. Explore the impact one person can have on another's life."
4,I thought the product was like any other ...,I thought the product was like any other of the Advil-type products that are out on the market now. I liked taking the smaller pills.
2,MOVIE WITH RUSSIAN SUBTITLES,"THIS MOVIE I BOUGHT THINKING THAT AT LEAST WOULD HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES, BUT IT HAS ALL KIND OF FOREIGN SUBTITLES, INCLUDING RUSSIAN, AND NOT ENGLISH OR EVEN SPANISH SUBTITLES. IF WE LIVE IN THE AMERICAN CONTINENT WHY IS THIS PEOPLE SELLING THIS MOVIE TO PEOPLE THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH WITHOUT TELLING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE MOVIE?"
3,"Better-than-average B5 book, but sub-par for Peter David","This book definitely is an improvement over most of the early Babylon 5 novels. However, for anyone familiar with the science fiction of Peter David, this book is a let-down. The dizzying complexity of sub-plot upon sub-plot upon sub-plot mixed with the hackneyed ""little did they know"" and ""unbeknownst to (X-character)"" foreshadowings grated on my nerves. Also, this story is a stand-alone, having no real connection to the B5 story arc.If you are familar with Peter David's brilliant comedic Star Trek novels ""Rock and a Hard Place"" and ""Q-in-Law"", you'll be disappointed. This novel is more closely related to David's ""Q-Squared"".If you want to read a superb B5 novel by David, I recommend ""In the Beginning"", a novelization which actually surpasses the B5 movie in characterization and style. You'll be glad you read it, and better off passing ""Thirdspace"" by."
5,Panasonic LS-82 portable DVD player,I ordered the LS82 DVD player based on the reviews I saw here. I really wanted the 12 hour battery so that was a strong point. I use the player mostly to play videos that I record from the TV when I am traveling to work on the bus. I have about an hour drive so that works well with one hour programs. I must say I am very happy with my purchase. The price was the best I had seen anywhere and was a bargain with the free shipping. The video quality is obviously not as good as on the TV but it is quite acceptable considering the size of the player. I have now had the player for about a month now and use it 2 to 3 times a week. So far it has been a great investment. I highly recommend it.
3,matt hardy figure,This figure comes with a ladder which is a great accessorie. his trousers are identical to the ones he wore at summer slam 2004.the figure is more flexible than most ruthless aggression figures and if you like matt hardy it is definetly worth buying.matthew05
1,Should not be marketed,Cheap and OK looking but... the mouse and keyboard seem to interfere and while typing one might suddenly find that a right click command has been given and you are merrily cutting and pasting and switching windows. Almost impossible to type more than a sentence without a hitch. Product should be withdrawn.
1,Come on People! You're Smarter than this!,"If ever I need reasuarnce that the vast majotity of people in the world are stupid, I remind myself this book exists. It's great. Really.RTR"
4,recipes speak for themselves,"i felt compelled to write after reading some negative reviews. i checked this out from the library (as is my habit to do before spending any money on my own copy-much less disappointment that way) and have made already 2 recipes. they were for the broiled salmon and oven-cooked ribs. i do not lie when i say that they were huge hits...the ribs i have done twice due to popular demand. i do realize that is not a lot of testing, but 2 recipes without a hitch the first time around making them has earned this cookbook a must-have. this is not gourmet dinky food, but real good home food . the food most of us choose to eat without resorting to cream-of-you-know-what or worse several hours of gastronomic acrobatics to find that your family doesn't like it. the only reason this did not get 5 stars was due to the low ratio of recipes given the amount of text and number of pages in this book."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COPY- IT IS A BOOK LIKE EVERY OTHER COOKBOOK,Such a copy of what is already out there. No need to say any more!
2,Purenex WH-20BB 20-Inch Whole House Carbon Block Water Filter,No pressure relief button on mine as described. Had to change my routing on the job i was doing to make it work. Was a good price but the quality suffers. Pentek much better.
4,Mostly great,"First Born was a really great book.. up until the end. There was just something missing that kept me from feeling like the story was wrapped up. Maybe it was because Sears never *really* tells you the whole story, and you'll come away with two entirely different impressions of the book, dependent on whether or not you read the epilogue.And although this is booked as a kind of supernatural thriller, I didn't find it to be unbelievably so. Some authors tend to go overboard with abduction and conspiracy theories, but I think Sears did a great job with it."
2,Kinda Cheap,"Not sure if they are still selling this, but it was purchased as a gift. Was cheaply made (cheap, thin ""leather"" straps), is kind of small, and maybe should only be used as a costume accessory to a party that you don't really want to go to."
5,It's Paper,The paper is college ruled as described. A few of the side binder holes were a bit off (perhaps by a millimeter) Product was fine though.
1,Amazon steals my money,Amazon charged my credit card $61.99 and promised shipping between Sept 17 and Oct 2. It is now October 12 and I have not received the printer. Several e-mails were sent but nothing has been done about it. As far as I am concerned Amazon has stolen the money and not performed thus losing any further business from me.I later discovered 5 letters of similar complaint on their site.
3,sold,I never even got the chance to use this Item. I sold my house and moved cross country and this is one of Items that went for sale before moving.
4,HP Support Service Rocks,"HP telephone support service provided my 12 year old daughter with a calm, step by step process in downloading a printer driver more compatible with her computer. We very much appreciate the time and the patience given to us."
5,Picky husband loves these,"My husband is really picky about shoes, and more so when it comes to work. He has weirdly arched feet and not all shoes fit right. He loved these, which was surprising since he didn't even try them one. The are true to the size, he is a 10.5 and they fit just right. They are not confining and the gel pad adds some comfort. He wears these everyday to work and loves them, they even helped with some hip pain from his older shoes. I will keep buying these."
1,Cruel Shoes,"Look good, hurt like heck.Uppers over front of foot crushes down in a pinch when walking. I had to adjust my step to leave my foot flat while walking as any bend in the shoe created unbearable pain. These are perfect shoes for sitting or attending your own wake."
3,Docker Men's Gordon Shoes,"Main issue I have is with sizing. I ordered EE width. What that translated into is W. While these are slightly wider than the last wide shoe I tried on, they are definitely not extra wide.As to construction, they feel like cheaply made shoes. It's as if they were ""made in China"". Oh wait, they are ""made in China"". Perhaps that explains everything."
1,Not what I bought,"I requested a wide but I received a medium, I can hardly wear it , it hurts me too much"
1,Not very good shoes,"These shoes are advertised as having leather uppers, but they are lined with vinyl and have a synthetic innersole. Even in cool weather, they are very hot and my socks were wet by the end of the day. Not what I expected for $50 from Dockers. Better off with the $15 vinyl shoes from Walmart who never misrepresents their products. I guess we have to spend closer to $100 for real leather uppers, from Beans or Timberland."
2,Hard to Break In,"I haven't had to break in a dress shoe in 10-15 years and I fo through a couple pairs a year. With these, after the first day my feet were very sore so I quit for a few days. Tried it again for a day and same thing. I will probably need to repeat this for a few more weeks."
4,good shoe,"The shoe looks good and fits well. I had to go for one size bigger than the usual size I wear. Overall, happy with the purchase."
2,not happy,the back of this shoe looks different than the one in the photo.it's too low cut. my heel is almost coming out the back.after trying them on i know i'll be wearing a hole in my sock in the heel area.
5,Good quality for the price,"Arrived in sooner than expected. Have worn Dockers Gordon Oxfords for the past few years and find they are comfortable out of the box and hold up well. The leather uppers are of good quality and actually leather (in comparison, I think Dr. Scholl's oxfords, though comfortable, do not wear as well, as the uppers are composite leather). The size I ordered in this style was correct for me: I would strongly recommend trying this shoe on in a store before making an online purchase."
3,Nice shoe,"The shoe is decent. It lasted 3 months before stitch fraying started to show which I burned off. I know I should rotate shoes, but this was an emergency purchase and I only got one pair. While I walk commute morning/evening a few blocks, I'm sitting the rest of the day. Still, I've had shoes worn daily last much longer, thus the 4 stars. On one shoe, the heel is starting to pull away from the leather. No, I don't 'kick' my shoes off. It could be this one pair.So, while a decent quality shoe... it appears the stitching & gluing could be improved. This is end of month 3 in the shoe and I'm looking for a replacement."
3,Narrow front,"Purchased this for my husband, who walks a lot at work. Looks great. It is true to size; however, runs narrow at front, squeezing his toes for a couple of months. Prefer this interior to other proStyle shoes (which has the yellow/gel visible), see pictures. So, half size bigger might do perfect."
4,"Nice looking and comfortable shoe, tho top-creased very quickly","The shoe looks just like the picture - very comfortable to wear and looked great out of the box.My only complaint is how quickly these shoes developed creases.i put the shoes on, took one or two steps and looked in the mirror to see how they looked with my pants. And there they were: 2 perfectly and quite deeply-made creases across the top of both shoes.. Permanent ones which erased that New-Shoe look in about 3 seconds of wear time. I found that to be a bit odd and annoying. But being that they were pretty inexpensive and not 100$-plus shoes i'm still pretty happy with the purchase. and the shipping was very fast."
2,size too small,"The shoes are so small that the foot cannot break in. The leather seems good, but I guess it will not be durable."
4,Comfortable right from the box,Comfortable right from the box. Needed a new pair of dressy shoes for a wedding. Wore them twice before the wedding and then danced all night in them. Happy with my purchase.
4,"Nice shoe, takes a while to break in",Nice looking shoe for the money. Took a while to break in. Easily scratched finish.
5,Been buying them for years,"I just keep buying them, wearing them out, and buying them again. On my 5th pair. Comfortable, take a beating and clean up real well. Can be used for casual, business casual. Great shoes, great price."
3,my 5th pair,"I have worn these shoes for years, buying the exact same ones for 5 years. They tend to last around a year of daily usage after when the front stitching falls out. They are very comfy and water resistant. They have a short break in period of 4-5 wearings, and I just wish the polish would last longer, because they turn a dull black after only a few weeks. I also wish they could make a stitching that doesn't fall out in a year.Otherwise, the grip is good, the leather is very durable and keeps it's comfort, and the soles wear down gently - they are of a very good rubber material.Update 7/30/12: The quality of the soles has gotten worse on these, and they wear away pretty quick now. See the image I uploaded. The stitching of the leather upper has improved and not fallen out, but the soles have torn and cracked. I have reduced the rating from 5 to 3 stars."
3,Good,"I got these for my 14 year old son. Since he does not dress up often, these were just fine for him."
2,Caveat emptor,"I have purchased over 8 pairs of these shoes in black and cordovan over 10 years time. They were the most comfortable shoes I have ever owed. Unfortunately, the last two pair I bought (black and cordovan) were sized small and rubbed my heal raw. After checking out a few other reviews, it appears that others are experiencing the same problem. It appears that something has changed with the production of these shoes over time. Good luck!"
5,Great for women too!!,"As a former teacher,who was on her feet all day, these shoes are indispensable. They wear well, and are extremely comfortable. They also accommodate my orthodic inserts with ease. I am on my 10th pair! I always buy a black pair and a brown pair, each lasting about 2 years. Fabulous shoes. And yes, I do get compliments on them from WOMEN who want to know where I got my cool looking shoes. They work great with jeans and dress pants! Thank goodness they make smaller men's sizes for women's size feet! I will wear no other shoe for everyday wear!"
3,**Narrow!**,"I really don't know how to rate these shoes honestly. The drop-down sizing box is just plain wrong. I have very wide feet and had hoped that the 2E width was at least partially accurate. Having received the shoes, they 'look' like they could be a great shoe for the money...but I wasn't even able to get my foot into the first shoe.So, they look great; color is rich, the laces are relatively thick and seem like they'll stay tied, and the sole is substantial. They might even be comfortable and wear well. But the sizing chart is way off. My guess is that 2E is equivalent to D. I have no idea what the equivalent is to what they are calling a D. If they offered them in 4E (if there is such a thing), I'd try them again...but they don't."

5,Rhem 2 - PC,"This is my kind of game - if no people are present - You have to walk very carefully were ever you go - and many times back tracking - taking many, many notes and more notes - and knowing you arthmatic real well - Both Rhems I liked very much - but I do recommed you have a walk through or a help - it is very hard in some place - I like the graphic work - very nice and so real like - I hope we have more like these"
4,A Certain Kind Of Cutting Edge,"Something's going on here---call it American Millenial Rock---that resonates with bands as diverse as Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse. Antecedents are complex and rich, from the Brian Wilson/Jimmy Webb California dream-pop to the Band/Buffalo Springfield, to countless lost psychedelic sonic explorers and,in Lambchop's case, sweet soul. It's an exciting record because of its richness. It doesn't give it all up on a couple of listens. I won't be surprised if it's a unanimous Top 10 choice when 2000 wraps up. It's that good and getting better."
1,I wish I could give zero stars,"I really enjoyed this CD, until my boyfriend informed me it was NOT intended to be humorous.Between the unimaginative melodies, senseless lyrics, the over-used glockenspiel and a singer whose voice could make God's ears bleed, the entire effort is unlistenable."
3,Good.....but lose the falsetto.,"I discovered Lampchop last year through ""How I Quit Smoking."" How did this band get under my radar for so long? Kurt Wagner is an amazing guitar player and his voice is fine for this genre (quirky, menacing deadpan delivery). The understated, subtle arrangements are perfect. And Paul Niehaus lays down some of the most gorgeous steel guitar you'll ever hear.I want to like this CD as much as their previous efforts, but everything that makes Lampchop so special is almost washed away in a sea of string arrangements and Wagner's hard-to-bear falsetto (what's up with that?!). There are plenty of highlights such as You Masculine You (check out the coda at the end...good stuff), Petrified Florist, Butcher Boy and Up With People. This CD showed up on a lot of Best of 2000 lists and undoubtedly a lot new fans discovered Lambchop through this CD. It's not their best, but even sub-par Lambchop is better than none. It's hard to argue with music this well-crafted."
2,Didn't like it at all,"I purchased this item based on its several positive reviews. I didn't like it at all. The ""strategically placed stitching"" for gripping or whatever it's for looked really sloppy to me. I found the texture of the neoprene to be very aversive to the touch. I returned mine. I'm glad it's working for some people. It seems like it probably protects the computer pretty well."
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't expecting much from a pair of toy handcuffs, but I was expecting more from Schylling. In my experience, they generally produce quality toys at a reasonable price. These cuffs are only slightly better than a pair of plastic toy cuffs. The hinges and lock mechanism are stiff, but that can be fixed; however, the metal stampings are thin and the chain links are flimsy. I hate to sound like an old guy, but the novelty cuffs I bought back in the 70s from the Johnson Smith catalog were a much better product. As an alternative, I recommend these:Magic Escape Realistic Handcuffs. A little more expensive, but vastly superior."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","True, I only bought this as an accessory for a Halloween outfit but it lasted for one showing. Pulled them out of the box and tried the key once and they broke. Waste of time. Get what u pay for....."
3,"Reasonable Sound, but breaks easy","The sound is reasonable; i would say my sony studio monitor headphones give a more accurate sound than this does, but then it is biased towards gaming. However they broke within a weak of traveling, as they are very fragile and not easy to pack except to take a rather large solid case to put them in. Do not recomend to get these if you wil lbe traveling with them."
3,A Fall From Grace,"Although a compelling drama, this film lacked a certain "" Je ne saia quoi."" Clearly, one would be disappointed after experiencing any of his other films"
5,awesome,This fire fighter costume is so much like the real thing. My two year old had to have it because his grandfather is a fireman. Everyone was impressed with the quality.
2,Had no helmet!,"Absolutely quality costume, our 6 yr old grandson thinks it's fabulous........there was supposed to be a helmet though and there was not one. I have not been able to get in touch with anyone to see how I can get the helmet. Other than that it was great, sort of hoping a low rating like this will get someone's attention!"
5,Great Costume,"We bought this for our 4 year old son for halloween. It arrived much quicker than we realized. When we opened the package, we were pleased with the quality of the material. Our son was so excited with the costume that he wore it everyday after pre-school for at least 2 weeks. It has not shown any wear. I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a firefighter costume. This is much better than anything I have seen sold in stores. Highly recommend."
3,"Great pictures, mediocre story.","The extremely detailed illustrations are stories in themselves-- which is good, because the written story falls short. There are opportunities for the author to confront the farmer with challenges (""how do we get this great, enormous turnip over to the castle? let's try...."") but never does. I would have loved to see the look on the squire's face at the poetic justice served him at the end, but alas, the book ends as abruptly as the conflicts are resolved."
4,brando revealed,it pierces the heart of the man. a genius who was very uneducated. always probing to find out who he was. when he finally did his view in the rear view mirror glimpsed too much reckage and too much pain. oh if only he had been guided by true mentors with his true interest at heart .. if he reads this himself he will surely ache and see himself.
1,Avoid it,"I have been searching for this to appear on DVD for eternity ... you can imagine my suprise (negative one) when i got it! Awful picture quality, lloks like a poor VHS recording put on disc and sold as DVD. Maybe it was my version only (i never got the respond back when i wrote the complaint)."
2,Hot Legs,"This book will certainly disappoint if you're hoping to learn something new. The first 15 pages talk about the importance of weight training and cardio/aerobic exercise over and over and over. The workouts are not at all the challenge you would expect if you want ""Hot Legs"". What this book offered was a repeat of the same information you get in all the fitness magazines. Nothing new, creative or challenging. I finished it so quickly I could send it back in tomorrow's mail and I just received it today. What a disappointment. Don't waste your money."
3,OK but flimsy built,"Cheap built skillet works OK, about as good as it costs. Very lightweight skillet, but glass lid is good idea."
3,An OK pan,This pan was not the quality I expected...and lid came with a a ding in the metal rim that I pried out rather than return the whole pan. For the price I could not expect more and the pan has worked well as it is a deep saute pan and what I needed.
3,dollar store quality,"This is a cheap lightweight pan, similar to what you might find in a dollar store. The pan I got has rounded sides, instead of the vertical sides as pictured so while it is 11 inches on top, it is only 8 inches at the bottom. The glass cover has a bulky knob which is not easy to get a grip on. Mine arrived with small dents in it."
2,Poor Quality,"I haven't used this pan yet, but when I took it out of the box and washed it, the handle was loose. I had to tighten the handle with a Philips screwdriver. It doesn't seem to be very well constructed and is extremely lightweight. It seems cheap to me, and I don't think I'll be buying any other merchandise made by this company."
3,Not the item in the picture,We were looking for a pan with vertical sides as shown in the picture. That is not what we received. If the product has changed then the photo should be updated.
2,sounds reasonable but didn't work,"I have three longhaired cats and followed the book's instructions to the letter but I now have a Persian peeing on the floor and none of us are happy. I think the book was well written but it raised false hopes claiming it would work for all cats. I even did it the alternative method. Maybe my cats are just dumb, but they wouldn't balance on the edge of the seat. Oh, well. I'd still like it to work out but I think I would need direct advice from the author."
2,My cat is trained but not by this method,"I was determined to get our new cat toilet trained and researched You Tube and Amazon for theories and information. I finally settled on this book because this author was supposed to be the original expert from the 90s. Well, in the 21 day program, we got half way through successfully, but then came the plastic wrap over the toilet and it was a disaster. I changed to ""The Toilet Trained Cat"" method which was to use an aluminum pan and it worked great. It actually took us 60 days to train the cat and we did have a few challenges, but it was worth it. My cat has been using the toilet for 2 months now with great success. My daughter and I laugh now when we walk by the litter isle at Target because we don't need to buy that overpriced smelly junk anymore. Don't give up. It will work!"
3,Latinamerican Really Rock & Roll,"Rock & roll plus blues. Juan Antonio Ferreira, is an excellent musician. Very rock and roll."
1,CRAP!!,"Wow what a stink router. The victim of terrible electronic engineering. This router has NO range whatsoever. The computer is only 15 feet away from the router. The signal strength constantly jumps around from Low to Good, the signal isnt stable. On top of that, the connection constantly disconnects! Avoid this junk at all costs. Linksys doesn't stand for quaity anymore"
1,Warning - WRT55AG,"This product is rushed to the market but not yet ready for prime time.Issues:1) If you are using VPN to access your companies network - forget it, this product won't allow you to connect (will not pass IPSec-L2TP or PPTP traffic through)2) WEP encryption doesn't work - yes, you can enable it but after 3 min you will loose connectivity with you wireless network. With WEP disabled connectivity will stay up.3) MAC filtering doesn't work also - the router will reset back to default (Disabled) setting as soon as you submit changes to it.4) Changing Internet Filters setting will reset this router to factory default.5) Firewall is also not performing well.6) Tech support is ""dancing"" and you won't give you any type of answer when they will come up with firmware upgrade - they won't allow you to talk to a supervisor also - USELESS.On my scale from 1 to 5 this product gets 1.5.RMA"
1,Linksys they fail to honor their rebate don't buy,Linksys has failed to honor two rebates from me and no doubt countless others. Don't buy Linksys!!! They are lying cheating SOB's
1,We also sent ours back,I have a cable modem going to a Linksys router (not wireless) that then goes to 4 computers in my home network. The wired Linksys router has been working for years with no problems.Then we decided to go wireless becasue we now have a laptop with a built in wireless network connection. So I pulled out my wired router and installed this wireless router plus access point. It was nothing but trouble. Not only did the wireless connection keep going up and down. But the hard wired computers also started lossing network connectivity.After several days of setup attempts we brought it back to the store where we bought it and asked for our money back. I put the original wired router back and was up and running in minutes. If you already have a router I think a Linksys access point may be ok. But the access point/router combination didn't work for us at all.
2,Latest firmware - REQUIRED,"The initial release of this router was very unreliable. Recently, Linksys released a new firmware - version 1.67. I have loaded it and have had better luck with this firmware than when I first got it.The initial firmware would not connect to my ISP. It also had to be rebooted daily to allow the wireless network card on my laptop to connect to it.This could be a 3, possibly 4, star review. However, I have not had version 1.67 firmware long enough to see if Linksys / Cisco got the major issues fixed. Proceed with caution."
1,Just terrible,If you are buying this for the 802.11a don't bother. After fighting to get it even working with factory defaults I finally got it up and running. Then I opened port 80 on my firewall and the router crashed and I had to hard reset it. Once I finally got it to connect agian I could not enable WEP. Once you enable WEP on the 802.11a network the network stops broadcasting. So long as all you want out of it is factory defaults you may be ok.The product basically does not work at all for 802.11a.
2,Needs Improvement,"What can you say about a $99.95 Power Washer? Needs Improvement.Unlike the other reviews, I utilized this Pressure Washer for several projects...Deck Washing, Pool Liner, Concrete Driveway and also borrowed to my neighbors for their projects. Combined over 100 Hours of Use. The only Flaw is the connection of the extension wand to the spray nozzle. My unit unfortunately broke in this location, replacement not available.. I even tried a J-B Weld Epoxy repair and secured with #8 Screws Directly to the Extension Wand. When &quot;Pressured Up&quot; the connection let go! As a low cost intro level Power Washer, you will get your usage BUT Don't abuse by dropping the Wand or use adversely."
4,"Very interesting, insightful, but no real solutions","This was a very intelligent, well-written, somewhat dense book (i.e., not cute pop-psychology fluff -- you had to read carefully). It went a long way toward explaining why passion dies, even in a really good, close marriage. She also reassures us that infidelity is more the norm than the exception! But I really didn't find any helpful solutions for regaining the passion in here. Fight more? Have affairs and don't feel guilty about them? I just don't know."
5,My job just got much more fun!,"This book has it all: consise descriptions, effective real-world examples and great support by the author himself whenever I've had any questions!!!. Within a day I had my first Web application up and running and impressed the boss enough to buy into our whole ""DNA 2000"" solution! The best $20 I've *ever* spent!!!"
1,Exasperating!,"Author's sincere, friendly and easy-going style is more than offset by a totally discombobulated format. Most aggravating of all is the burying of disjointed and ambiguous steps in paragraphs of fluff."
1,Waste of Money,"I'm returning this book. The ""Groundbreaking Tupler Technique"" is this: hold in your abs tight toward your spine. That's it. The rest of the book covers simple stretches and toning exercises that are common sense."
5,Good Basic Hat tips and Ideas,"I beg to differ with others comments that this book wasn't as helpful as they would have liked. It gave great examples of what was possible in design. I found it more interesting than the 'from the neck up book' which was too technical. First off, the photography is great. The examples of hats are awesome. I loved the project for the appliqued garland straw brim. Overall,it's a great book to have if you're interested in millinery."
2,Good if you want help decorating a hat...,"I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who wants to make a hat. The actually millinery section is very small, with few patterns included. Most of the book is about embellishing & decorating hats with some pretty over the top examples. Definitely not what I was looking for(a millinery technique book)."
4,Beware of the cold,Good system but I live in Northern Maine and the outdoor remote chews through lithium batteries in the winter. Forget regular batteries below zero. Much better luck during the warmer months. I like the lighted display. I have it about 10 feet from my woodstove so it's pretty neat (to me anyway) when I get a 100 degree differential between indoor/outdoor readings.
1,Precious little insight or humor,"It is not clear whether Harry Shearer intended ""It's the Stupidity, Stupid"" to be an insightful political commentary, a stand-up routine, or both. What is clear is that the end result achieves neither of these ends. The question Shearer posits and then seeks to answer is why so many people hate President Bill Clinton so vehemently. He posits a few theories ranging from racism to age, but the analyses are insipid and devoid of anything truly insightful or new. Nor is there all that much to find especially humorous unless it is in the ad personem attacks on various right-wing figures. Perhaps the book's saving grace is that it ends less than 100 pages after it begins. Certainly, this is one of the more banal entries in the Library of Contemporary Thought."
2,Lame and Poorly Written,"The book starts pretty well, but the author's poor writing style comes through very early on. There are sections that are quite repetitive. The facts are questionable. If you must have it, it's on the shelves in the Manchester, England airport book stores, in case you know someone there. I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad that I remember the author's name so I know to avoid his works in the future.At least he doesn't shy away from the sensitive topics.Maybe the definitive biography has not yet been written."
1,tabloid-esque,"This book does nothing for Freddie Mercury fans. It just doesn't have any real facts or substance. Much of the text is written like ""Freddie must've thought..."" or ""This shows his blah blah"". Much of Sky's statements are based on his own opinions that are supported by quotes that Freddie may or might not have said. This leaves too much room for conclusions drawn that are out of context.Don't get this book. It does have some nice pictures but overall, the book is too tabloid-esque and a major disappointment."
1,Save your time and money on this floppppppp,"This is the first time ever where the DVD went from the player, put it back in the holder and went directly into the kitchen opened the cabinet into the trash. Never looked back."
3,Historical Interest Only,"I love Django's playing, but these are recordings of him just messing around in the studio. If you're a Django fan, you might find enough hear to be worth what you pay for it. But I found myself listening to it once, satisfying my curiosity, and leaving it on the shelf thereafter."
2,Bad Movie,"If you like Bresson films maybe you'll like this L'Enfance Nue. I like some (can stand would be more precise) Bresson movies. This Maurice Pialat's first film didn't caught my attention at all. I kept reading a book all along. Sometimes feels like a bad documentary. Maybe I was in the wrong mood, but I doubt it."
4,2 out of the 3 of the CDs are Superlative,In order of preference#1 - Yo-Yo Ma plays Ennio Morricone: You can't go wrong with this one. It's a wonderful pairing. It's like being transported to another time and space.#2 - Classic Yo-Yo: If you love the cello then you'll appreciate this one.#3 - Soul of Tango: Was a little too rambunctious for my tastes and usage. Virtually the music I buy is for work (massage therapy). Tango is an acquired and/or situational taste. It might be idea if you need to stay psyched up;)
3,great book,"The book addreses the mid east problem and the bond between the islamic countries. It is a great book to read through but if you are looking for some thing to interpret on, foget about it. As usual it displays only one side of the conflict portraying the muslims as the root of evil, while ignoring the position the ""villians"" stand on. The author sure did his research but the technicalities of the events are all wrong. The hero is depicted as an almost ultimate human and the villians as incompident, idiotic fools. It cruises nicely through out and is hard to put down. It gets a little cheesy with soap opera type romance but that does not shadow the supperior wrting style. If you're more concerned with reality, technicalities, and interpertations etc, I'd advise to pass on. But if you're looking for a simple escape with out any major thinking, You're in for a good treat. Enjoy"
4,Excellent Bible!! Humbling and interesting to read in chrono order!,This Bible is awesome because it sets little daily increment readings and gives you a little of God's word every single day. Another unique feature is that its in chronological order for a better understanding of how every book fits together like a puzzle from Genesis all the way until the Life of Christ. As a Christian its exciting to understand how everything unfolded in the correct sequence. The only thing I would add is maybe a daily encouragement pertaining to the text and how to apply it to your life that very day because this Bible is just straight through. But I highly recommend this Bible!!
4,"Great for another ""read through the bible in a year"" option","If you've read any of the other ""One Year"" bibles you'll love this one too. It does not have the OT, NT, Psalm, and Proverb for everyday but it is chronological so it is a whole different way of grasping the bible and the times of which the events happened. I only wish they would produce a ""One Year"" bible that had the study notes included."
2,For Prima Completists Only,"I was a little disappointed with this film. I know the name, and a fair amount of the material, but was hoping to gain some insight to the Man. Got some, but not much. Maybe a bit too esoteric for the curious. Much of the information was glossed over. There is mention of ""The Lion King"", and Prima's influence on contemporary rock n' roll, but there is never any further exploration of these topics. I wanted to know the thought process behind the deadpan delivery of Keely Smith's on-stage persona, as well as a host of other things, but was left high and dry... This is probably common knowledge to the fan ""in the know"". However, for the rest of us... The footage is fantastic, but I never felt I really got to know Louis Prima, or even his work, really. Isn't that the point?"
4,Great Documentary on Louis Prima with Terrific Performances.,This DVD is great. Louis Prima was a little before my time in real life. I became a fan long after his death. This has some amazing vintage footage as well as some current footage of this legend of swing.Its a great lesson on importance of showmanship.It is thoroughly enjoyable.
1,Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 8- and 10-Inch Omelet Pans,"These are the nicest easiest pans I have ever used. I own a set of Circulon which I paid about $300.00 for. These two pans for under $50.00 out cook my more expensive pans. They are quickly heated, cook evenly, and clean up in a breeze. I would highly recommend these as an addition or to replace your current pans!"
3,An okay disc for small dogs,"My 9.5 lb disc maniac Jack Russell Terrier hates this disc. I thought she would prefer the rubber to the hard, pup discs but no. She'll catch it then not bring it back to me which is almost unheard of with this dog. It flies much better than a flippy flopper small sized disc but I had to go with the Hyperflite Softflite pup discs for her."
2,Cheap Fabric,"I would firstly like to say that it is a shame Amazon don't ship directly to Australia. I have to order and have items shipped to my niece and then she has to re ship to Melbourne. When I received the product I was a little disappointed as the fabric feels very synthetic and dare I say it, cheap :( I bought these for gifts because I have one which I've had for years and find invaluable when travelling, mine is made of raw silk and is lightly bigger. The ones I purchased are a good size but I'm reluctant to give them as gifts because I feel like they look and feel cheap. Such a shame. They look much better in the photos."
2,Not great if you play the keyboard-except philosophy,"The keyboard parts in this book are fairly simple and unchallenging with the exception of Philosophy. If you are looking for a book that has a lot of good licks but less boring background stuff that you can play by ear, get the Signiture Keyboard licks book and whatever and ever amen. If you have the Signiture Keyboard book, you have realized that the most essential and challenging part of the song Philosophy is missing in the Signiture keyboard licks book, and this is why I purchased this album book. I am happy with paying the price for it because playing Philosophy straight through is really a rush. The price is well worth it if you don't mind having a book that will only have a few fun song in it. Also, if you are looking for good tab and the full score, this book is almost note for note."
2,"Not great for Keyboarders, with exception of Philosophy","The keyboard parts in this book are fairly simple and unchallenging with the exception of Philosophy. If you are looking for a book that has a lot of good licks but less boring background stuff that you can play by ear, get the Signiture Keyboard licks book and whatever and ever amen. If you have the Signiture Keyboard book, you have realized that the most essential and challenging part of the song Philosophy is missing, and this is why I purchased this album book. I am happy with paying the price for it because playing Philosophy straight through is really a rush. The price is well worth it if you don't mind the extra hundred or so pages thrown in with philosophy. If you are looking for good tab and the full parts, this book is almost note for note."
4,Good compact printer...,...a great printer. Nice and compact. Just 2 annoying things:1) the AC adapter seems needlessly HUGE since its really light in weight.2) Retail package does not come with a standard A-B USB interface cable
2,"It's so bad, it's almost comical.","When it prints, it prints ok - about as good as you'd expect from a cheap printer.The problem is, I think it's possessed. Clearly some evil force has taken over my printer. It works when it wants to. It may print 10 sheets without a problem and then jam on every sheet after that. And when it jams it makes a horrible clunking noise. If you print a multi-page document and it jams on the last sheet - once the jam is cleared - it may decide to reprint everything again, or nothing at all.Sometimes it will start printing when you haven't Queued anything. You'll be sitting there, minding your business, and it will feed a sheet of paper and start printing. And when you check your print Queue, you'll find it's empty.My family is planning to put it in the back yard and let everyone have a chance beating it with a hammer. I'd say, save up your empties for a few weeks and buy something a little better."
5,Loved it! Humorous without being filthy,"We're tired of dark, depressing, vulgar movies. This one is the opposite and one of Kate Hudson's best. The other leading actors were excellent, too."
3,Needed more of John Krasinski,"Formula movie that I actually liked -- but couldn't understand why Jennifer Goodwin's character was best friends with Kate Hudson's character. The person Kate Hudson plays is so immensely unlikable I can't understand why these characters are drawn to her. Besides that point, Jennifer Goodwin does an excellent job with her role and John Krasinski steals the movie. I would have liked to seen more of him. No great message here but John Krasinski and Jennifer Goodwin are worth watching."
5,"loved it, almost as much as the book!","I loved this movie!! I would really recommend reading the book & others by Emily Giffin. Of course the book is better than the movie, but the movie was really cute. It's not like most chick flicks, which are predictable. If you haven't read the book, the end will surprise you. My boyfriend went w/ me & actually said it wasn't bad, but I think he secretly really liked it (he was laughing through the whole thing). Can't wait for the dvd to come out!!"
1,Are you kidding me?! Really?!,The only character with any integrity was Ethan. Deplorable characters outside of him... Very poorly written script. Teenage love story without depth. To give it one star is overrating it. Ugh...
2,"Not the best, too much swearing","This movie has LOTS of swearing, it would of been alot better and sweeter if they had elimanted that. There was alot of just dumb parts that really had nothing to do with anything. With lots of editing and a different ending, it could of been good. It has a few good parts, but they are few and far between..."
5,Love longing!,"I really enjoyed this movie. However, for a moment toward the end I thought it was going to go a different way and I really, really wanted it to go that way. BUT it didn't! Still, I liked the movie a lot. It had some really good moments. I love romance and longing."
4,Liked it alot,Watched it on a plane and enjoyed it very much. It surprised me that I liked it as much as I did.
1,Expensive SOAP Opera,"Same old story - 'A' loves 'B', 'B' loves 'C', 'C' does not know whom to love etc....Totally unimaginative story of a smart American Male and/or Female feels shy to show his/her feelings/love to the right partner.Lots of drama - drama of cheating, adultery, dishonesty and things of that nature this movie will be right up your alley.Do rent if you want to be terribly bored.I gave ""one star"" since I rented it from RedBox for $1.08, which I think is ""total"" waste - if I would get it ""free"" then probably I would go for ""two star"" - probably.... who knows!!!"
1,Terrible,"This is by far the worst romantic ""comedy"" I have ever seen. There is no depth to any character, everyone is selfish and by the end you are just happy that it is over and don't care what happens to these women."
4,"Like this, don't understand movie reviewers!!!","Very good story. Don't love the cheating, but love that the main girl wins her guy and that true-love finally wins out in the end. Don't love the attitude of Kate Hudson's character; she obviously didn't love her BFF enough to want her to be happy. Especially the way she swooped in and stole Colin Egglesfield's character's interest in the beginning. Interesting plots and twists."
2,mediocre,Movie was rarely funny and barely worth the time we invested in it. I think Kate Hudson phoned this one in.
2,It was not what I expected - didn't like the ending,"I think Ginnifer Goodwin is adorable. I love Kate Hudson. I think I was expecting something different from this film and I guess I got what I expected. It was different. 2 women, best friends forever, lots of cheating and lying going on, broken hearts, more cheating and in the end, it's all a-okay. I was disappointed. Kate Hudson gets excited in the end to have a baby with a total spaced out grown up who acts like a teenager. Really? It just didn't fit. I think I have to watch it again to look for a reason to like the film."
1,god awful,I hated everything about this film. If in the future I meet a person that tells me that they enjoyed this movie I will know to stay very far away from them. I can not believe a woman wrote this.
4,Girls' Night Movie,Great chick flick with an equally great cast! Definitely recommend this movie for an entertaining girls' nite gathering with a happy ending.
1,Car Magnet,"I bought this for my dad as a christmas present. I ordered this one, and the helmet magnet. When I got the Magnets, I had 2 helmets, even though it said it was the bears head. Go figure! Thanks to Amazon for sorting that one out!"
3,not as good as pascal version,"I bought ""Algorithms"" by the same author (the pascal version) and it was one of the most absorbing textbooks I have read; great book. I didn't even need to take the course. :-) The diagrams and the visualization of sorting methods were especially helpful.I can't recommend the C version very highly though.. I only skimmed parts of it, but managed to find quite a few errors in the examples. Be sure to check out the errata on the author's web page. I'll stick with the pascal version.. I don't necessarily need runnable code to understand the algorithm anyway."
5,Great product,A co-worker who makes delicious candy said she uses Merckens. They are the best! Melt easily and are very creamy. Quick shipment. Will buy again.
3,Poor Stereotypes,"In _Bad Boy From Rosebud_, well acclaimed book from the bookfair in Austin Texas, there are some all too typical examples of otherwise well researched, good writing, failing to get a good grade due to the use of poor stereotypes. At one point the author is describing a run down neighborhood of dilapidated trailers: ""... a Harley Davidson motorcycle and a bright shiny pickup truck...""I cried Foul! Not fair to pick on Harley Davidson and then fail to identify the brand name of the pickup.In another paragraph he is writing of the ""menial jobs [such people] have as burger flippers in fast food joints and cashiers at convenience stores.""Likewise--Foul! As long as respected authors characterise such work as ""menial"" then those who do that work will continue to think little of themselves.--ajo"
2,mediocore,"it isn't a scary movie at all. i saw it in class and i thought it was realy funny, because its kind of reflecting all the wrong things that happen today. i wouldnt really recomend watching it but seeing alot of them really gave me the creeps nate"
3,Awesome Asgardian fights then confusion!,"I don't think I've ever read anything by Michael Avon Oeming before and after doing so, I'm still not sure what to think. The first of this book was mind blowing fight after jaw dropping fight, all drawn amazingly by Andrea DiVito. However, the last half, especially the final chapter, was so metaphysically confusing that I don't know what happened except I'm sure it was all undone by later writers. Overall it was a decent read but better to look at."
3,Great photos BUT........,"This is a nice looking book filled to the brim with great-looking photos. However, starting with the pages devoted to this past years awards and working my way backwards only about a quarter of the way through the book so far, I have been disappointed to find numerous errors already. For instance, Philip Seymour Hoffman is listed as a sinful omission for failing to score a nomination in 1999 for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", which is valid, except he is listed as Seymour Philip Hoffman. In summarizing 1994, it is noted that Dianne Wiest won her second Academy award under Woody Allen's direction, the first being for 1982's ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", which of course happened in 1986. I realize this might seem like nit-picking, but there are a number of small errors like the examples I've given, so it's just a little disappointing, that's all."
1,Correction to my review,"Sorry...I was typing a bit quickly. Katharine Hepburn has won four Oscars, not three as I had written in my review."
2,Tomb of the Unconscious Soldier,"Let me say first I like Desree. Now let me be blunt: this cd sucked. Out of 10 songs and 1 remix, there is only 1 decent song ""It's Okay"" (no pun intended) and one great song: ""Fate"". The rest of this cd is just no good.The main problem with this cd is the peddling of message songs. No one wants to hear message songs, that they can't dance, make love or clean to. The worst example on the cd is the song ""Human"", which sounds like Bill Cosby wrote it for his Fat Albert Cosby kids band. If you must put a self help book, Dr Phil type message in your music use Amel Larrieux as a good template. Her music is positive and fun.Again, I like Desree, and you will to, just do yourself a favor and buy the ""Mind Adventures"" cd which is great, then go on iTunes and buy ""Gotta Be"" from her other cd, and then just buy the track ""Fate"" off this cd which is solid."
5,Great deal!,This was a great deal. I was looking for practice balls for my girls team and could not find them in my area for under $50. I got them for $40 shipped.
1,Sick?,"This book is yet another screed about how people with psychiatric diagnoses lack insight, are too pitiful to help themselves, etc. This book ignores all the research about the dangerous and painful ""side effects"" of many psychiatric drugs. It doesn't strike me as ""insane"" to refuse to take powerful mind altering drugs that leave your body twisted like a pretzel. And the book ignores the role of childhood sexual abuse in the backgrounds of the majority of people labeled ""schizophrenic"" , and tries to have us believe that ""schizophrenia"" is a ""biological brain disease"" of which there is not one iota of scientific evidence! People should avoid this book like the plague, and read Robert Whitaker's ""Mad in America: Bad Medicine, Bad Science, and the Continuing Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill"" instead!"
3,moderately helpful,Moderately helpful to those with siblings with Schizophrenia. Not so helpful to those who have a parent with the disease as the family dynamics are much different.
4,Not Bad,"As a Community Worker, I liked Dr. Amador's book because it explained in simplistic language how a family can work with their family member who is struggling with a mental illness. It is a reasonably priced, and a quick read. I have used some of the techniques myself and found the information useful."
5,This Book Keeps Disappearing,"As a community psychiatrist, this book gives invaluable insight into the thought disorder involved in schizophrenia. I always recommend it to the staff at our mental health center when they express frustration about engaging one of our patients in the recovery process.Over the years I have purchase about a dozen copies of this book. Each copy is eventually loaned to a collegue or team member at some point in time. This is the one book that never seems to be returned. Because it is such a valuable resource, I will contiue to purchase it and ""loan"" it until I do get it back."
1,BAD BUY,"This is the worst tv I have ever had. We have sat here every night trying to get it to turn on and it takes forever. Tonight it will not turn on at all, I have had it for only a year."
3,More of a model than a toy,"The thing about these lego sets is that the toy aspect of it isn't durable for the average boy. Yes it's great learning how to put things together, but if the darn thing keeps losing pieces if you are playing with it as an ""action figure"" the kid gets frustrated and annoyed. And as the mom who has a hard time even figuring out how to build the thing, when a piece pops off, you have to almost refer back to the original directions which are nowhere to be found."
4,Worth reading,"I have read perhaps a 100 books on investing.. this one needs to be read. Brad writes without the hype and provides a simple investment strategy using price-volume-pattern. No fancy formulas, fibonacci or Gann in this book..just plain good old investing advice."
5,wonderful,"i first tried this product in my coffee at starbucks and was soon hooked. it tastes amazing without all the sugar/calories. i would def recommend this product. i purchased the pump with it, which makes dispensing the syrup very easy. i felt like i had my own gourmet coffee shop at thome!"
5,Yummy!,"I absolutely LOVE this sauce mix and I use it many different ways to prepare a delicious and satisfying pasta dinner. I usually use two packets for 16 ounces of penne pasta (prepared) and that ratio seems to work really well. Just add milk (I use skim) and olive oil and whisk the sauce in a small pan on the stove! I typically add minced garlic and grated Parmesan cheese as I'm cooking the sauce to thicken it and improve the taste to my satisfaction. In addition, I add prepared frozen chopped broccoli to the dish when I serve it and often grilled chicken for protein. Serve with a salad and you have a great dinner -- and very quickly!My last remark is that I usually pay $1.67 for each packet in the grocery store. I recommend this sauce mix to everyone!"
2,Not very well organized,"I was looking for a ""how-to"" book to start uncluttering my home. This book doesn't flow well at all. It hops from one subject to the next and doesn't provide instructions. Definitely not worth the money. The 7 step book (Simplicity Series) is much better for someone looking for small steps to start de-cluttering."
4,Great Camera (for the Great Outdoors),"If you're looking for a small camera that takes great pictures OUTSIDE, this is it. The mix of reviews this has received is due, in my humble opinion, to the fact that some people have mostly used it outdoors (the high scorers), and some other people have mostly used it indoors (the low scorers). The reason for this discrepancy is that the flash is not that good. If you're shooting indoor, you really need some other source of light for the picture to be of good quality, if you just use the built-in flash, you'll get a decent snaphsot, but nothing to brag about. Everytime I see indoor pictures I get disappointed at the quality (unless I remembered to use other lights) and everytime I see outdoor pictures I'm awed at the clearness and level of detail."
4,Nice Camera,I have had this camera for over a year and for the most part I am happy with it.- The size is great- It turns on and off very quickly- Easy to useThe only things that I don't like about the camera is its flash and the lag time when you push the button to take the picture.I really wanted a camera that takes pictures right when you push the button but it takes it a second sometimes.Over all I love this camera and would recommend it.
5,Complete satisfaction!,"The product was delivered on time, in new condition with all accessories as stated. The price was within $5 of the lowest."
3,Engineer's review,I had an old version and replace it with this version. Not much updating. Still a good reference for electrical distribtion engineers but was disappointed with the lack of topics fromn the last 20 years.
5,Great Indie Music,"This CD is a great example of why major labels are dead! An indie release that has more meat than most of the stuff coming out today. I love the images JD paints in some very diverse music. This music has edge and heart. Great vocals, lyrics and instrumentation. I especially love the ballads......."
2,Not Readable,The small floating answer object in the ball does not float into view very well. The answers are great but it is hard to read.
3,George H W Bush,"If you want a quick easy read at 219 pages this might fit the bill for you. I was hoping for more insight into the mans life. If this is indicative of the Penguin Lives series then they are great at telling you something about the man in a short book. I am about to finish my quest of reading a biography on every president, and with the exception of William Howard Taft, Bush has been the hardest to find anything about. Maybe there wasn't that much to the man, but I find this hard to believe. To a man every President to this point has been a complex and intriguing character.If you are really into political biography I would recommend anything from the Signature Series from American Political Biography Press."
3,Un-frickin-believable!!!,"If not for errors I would have rated this book 5*****. However i must be fair and say that this book kept me so indulged and pleased from both beginning to end that im anticipating the sequal, which for me is rare. The author may be new and unknown, but i wounder for how long. Get this one before the price skyrockets. You will not be dissapointed."
4,Skylark Takes Off,"This well written sequel to Sarah, Plain and Tall is a page-turner. Readers can't wait to find out what happens next to their beloved family on the plains. The dreaded drought causes much hardship; no water for the livestock, wells going dry, families leaving their farms, and the barn fire. Sarah and the children flee to Maine, her birthplace, to wait out the drought in safety. Luckily, the drought ends and Jacob goes to Maine to retrieve his family, including the newly pregnant Sarah! Patricia Maclachlan's writing is beautiful; full of imagery and feeling. It's easy to identify with these well-rounded characters."
3,Meh....,"This book dissapointed me. I guess the summary just sounded so sweet and intriguing, with the soldier slowing falling in love with this family through his letters from the little girl, and I was so dispointed when all of that took place within the prologue. Also, I knew there was going to be sex, but it was just so cliched and ridiculous that I coudln't stand it...and it was just so soon! I just couldn't buy into it. The story wasn't all bad, I just couldn't really be drawn into it."
4,Run for your Wife:a new comedy,Very funny play.I saw it years ago in the UK and my friend is an amateur actor.I have lent it to her to read to try to persuade someone to put it on.The book gives detailed instructions about dialogue and actions and props etc
5,from a student of astrology,"As with all of Liz Greene's books, I cannot recommend highly enough; find her in depth knowledge of great assistance for the interpretation of charts. The fact that the dark side of our individual leanings assists in a broader picture & adds to the flavour of other corresponding aspects.It helps me to understand myself better & my reactions."
1,W O R S T book I've ever used,"This book is horrible, I am one of those guys that read and solve the examples before starting the exercises; even they were solved in class. I like to get the concept perfectly but with this book is impossible.Few and unclear examples.It should be 1/2 star, not even one!!!!"
3,A Disappointment,"This DVD was disappointing on many levels. Firstly, Shannon Tweed is showing signs of aging that detract from the video, and secondly, the video itself is boring and not very sexy. The part with Alicia Rickter however is amazing. She is a beautiful woman and the fil really shows it. It's worth it for just this part."
1,Rip Off!,"Rip off! I bought an old edition for $1.99. You can buy the sixth edition for less then $100, im not sure why asking price is $500 for this book. Don't buy! Additional note: the older editions are essentially the same with one surprising difference, less typos."
4,very convenient,"was worried about excessive pain and ingrown hairs that come with using an epilator but so far neither of the two have happened. succeeded in epilating underarms a few times but find that to be too painful (hurts way more than waxing). read tips to take a hot shower before using epilator so that pores can open up, making the process less painful and reducing risk of ingrowns. this is what i try to do and so far, so good. in other words, it hasn't given me MORE ingrowns than waxing (when used on my legs).i'm not a long time epilator and this is my first one. i'm rather happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to pay the steep prices for getting your legs waxed OR doesn't want to wait till your hair grows out long enough (i think you can get away with removing shorter hair with the epilator). depending on where you live and whether or not you pay for waxing, this product can pay for itself in one use."
5,Great!!! it does not hurt almost. I love it.,Great Tool!!! It does not hurt almost. I love it. I bought this Silk Epil3 Soft perfection and I am so impressed with the quality and price. The delivery was fast. I am a super happy customer. Thank you.
1,Not Recommended,"This model is much less effective than my old Silk Epil that I used happily for eight years. I don't know why, but it doesn't get the hairs out. You have to go over the same area forever."
3,OUCH OUCH OUCH!,"All that I can say is OUCH OUCH WTF OUTCH. Are you serious? What women go through is beyond words! I'm not a hairy person but I wanted to try it out because I too hate having stubbles of hair growing back after 2 days of shaving my arm pits. My 1st and 2nd attempt, I used it on my underarms. It hurt so bad. I did get all the hairs off but it also left me with red blood spots. Not sure how that is more attractive and very sensitive arm pits for 2 days.I'm still planning on trying it out for a couple more runs. Like the review said, it will hurt less over time. Hard to believe). Using it on my legs and arms is not a big deal. The skin is tougher there and yet it pinches a little but not a big deal. Do some really use it for their bikini area? Wow. I can't even attempt to even think about that one.My guy roommate tried to use it on his chest and face but after 2 seconds, he screamed like a girl and said no way."
2,Unreliable after several months of usage,"I purchased this item in 2009. It has suddenly stopped working. Long before this it became less effective. I am not sure what has happened, but this is very disappointing for a product that is not low in cost. I will write to the manufacturer and see if they will provide a replacement or repair this one.When I called BRAUN they refused to take back the item. Instead they want me to pay for it to be repaired. Please avoid this product."
3,its ok...,"this is my first time using an epilator and i never waxed in my life but had used the cream for painless hair removal. suprisingly, i felt no pain at all while using the epilator, maybe its because i have relatively little leg hair but i had to roll over certain spots so many times since it doesn't get everything and it doesn't get everything by the roots. some of the hair get chipped off; so i guess its an ok product but not worth the price."
3,Good Epliator,I do like this product. Yes it hurts the first time you are pulling your hair out. lolPain is not bad. I have very fine hair though so sometimes instead of ripping the hair out it just breaks it off.Takes a long time as would any other Epilator. I had to go over and over to get all the hair. Did the armpits too. It worked well for that also.I gave it three stars for the breakage of my hair instead of pulling it out. I only get maybe 4 days (same as regular shaving) before I have to do it again. Also it does cost more than others.
2,Not Good Enough,"I was disappointed with this product. The rollers that are supposed to decrease pain are useless. All that attachment seems to do is make the unit less effective. Using the regular attachment without the rollers works a little better, but still left way too much hair behind. I have waxed for years so there isn't much pain for me. On the other hand, that should also make my hair easier to remove and this still didn't do even a halfway decent job. I have returned it and will try something else."
4,Where has this been all my life!,"This product is wonderful. I had been using another company's ""Epilady"" for last 15+ years and this was definitely a fantastic change. It takes 1/2 the time to do a more thorough removal. Best value, best option!!!"
4,Best epilator I've found so far,"I started epilating instead of shaving about three years ago. This one is the best I've found so far. It is fast yet gentle. That's the main thing. The other Braun (blue) is nice because of the light, but it doesn't grab as well as this pink one so is somewhat slow."
4,Review,For as cheap as this was I believe around 60 bucks. It does the job and it gets to the point. There is no need to go and purchase the 100+ epilators they all end up doing the same thing just some are advertised fanicer than ever. If you just want a a epilator to pull your hairs out in unwanted places and for a reasonable price. go with this!
5,Great epilator,"I bought this epilator for my girlfriend on her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. She said it's way much better than her old Phillips epilator. It's a great buy, and I'd definitely recommend it."
4,almost but not quite,"this is ok but i think if this could only work as well as waxing, I would give it a 5 star"
1,BEWARE OF PERMANENT SCARS! doesnt work that well anyway,"This product has left my legs completely scarred. It is horrible! I exfoliated regularly to prevent ingrowns but had a problem anyway, then they started getting infected and left horrible scars all over even months after I stopped epilating. You may think you will save time by not having shave everyday, but its not worth it and the epilator never even worked that well anyway. It looked like my skin was smooth when i used it, but to the touch i was still very spikey! Don't waste your money, spare your skin and stick to shaving. You will be happy you did!!!"
1,Don't Bother,I purchased this model based on the reviews. It simply doesn't get the hairs. I went up and down and sideways over and over again but this shaver was still not getting all the hairs. It's very frustrating. I could have dealt with the pain had this shaver actually worked.
4,Wish it had more parts,This is really good epilator but wish it had more parts with it...still it works great and I recommend it :)
4,Close & Smooth,"This product does everything it promises & at a price much less than the more expensive epilators, which I've had."
1,False Advertising,"Do not order from The Natural Health Shoppe. They have deceptive and false advertising and beyond poor customer service. My wife ordered a new Braun Silk SoftPerfection epilator. She received a box that was already open with pieces missing. When she contacted the company, she was told that the missing pieces weren't specifically listed on the product page, therefore, she wouldn't receive them. They neglected to comment on the fact that they sent a product that wasn't new even though she ordered a new product. Had the product been new and unopened as ordered, the missing pieces would have been present. According to their return policy, the product cannot be returned since it has been opened, so they succeeded in pawning off a used and incomplete item. I hope Amazon will not associate with this vendor in the future."
3,It could be better.,"It is much more prone to cause skin irritation, than others I have used. It goes unused most of the time."
5,Love it!,"I had never tried an epilator, I decided to buy one because my cousins were telling me how they used one for their legs and their legs were hairless for weeks! After they telling me that I should expect to spend around $50 or $60 on one I saw this one for $32 and decided to buy it and I have to say I loved it, it did a great job, I used it over two weeks ago and I still dare to use shorts because the hairs that have grown are very light and not noticeable. But it did hurt the first time, and I am used to waxing everywere. Still will keep using it, I am now in the search for one for facial hairs."
5,Great product!!,"Love this product!! For anyone who remembers the torture device from the '80 called Epilady, this couldn't be more different. No pain (it like using and electric shaver)and the hair is gone for weeks. That being said, I haven't tried it on my under arms yet, where most women felt pain.I highly recommend this product!!"
3,A good thriller,"I grew an appreciation for Greg Rucka's writing from his work in Gotham Central, Checkmate, Batman and Wonder Woman. He also did a good job of writing a story for Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow. And I've heard nothing but praise for his work in Queen and Country. So I thought I should pick up this surprisingly hard to find two-pack as my next book.Keeper is fairly straight forward and unfortunately not very gripping. I'd give it 2 stars. Finder I give 4, since Rucka really gets his footing with the action, suspense and characters. Now that his character is established, I think the Atticus Kodiak books will only get better."
4,"Listenable, good for someone who knows a little Spanish already","Informally, I've attempted to study Spanish for years. Having the audio in my car is a good supplement to reading kids' books in Spanish with a dictionary. It helps with the transition between understanding the print of a language and being able to understand the spoken language better.If you know nothing about Spanish, you may want to have some written course of study to supplement the audio. The ""listen-and-repeat"" format does sometimes move at a brisk pace, and it's only interesting if you're really motivated. Then again, if you are motivated, it's quite educational and helpful.I must concur with a previous poster's complaint that the ""ding"" in between sections is jarring, but would also consider it a minor annoyance."
4,Tres bon!,"No more shouting at waiters in English for me now. I am fluent enough now in the language of Cervantes and Iglesias to sing the Macarena, order a beer, and discuss the implications of feline narcolepsy on the North Sea fishing industry. The main reason I haven't awarded it the full five stars is because I was looking for a book on Spanish omelette making, and bought this in error."
5,Good Price for a Fine Course,"I haven't gone through the whole thing yet, but since I bought it I have already added many many Spanish words to my vocabulary. I'm pleased with it so far!"
5,Great beginner to intermediate Spanish program,This program is a great beginning to intermediate Spanish program. The pace is good. There is a good variety of all Spanish language aspects.
3,Good course but can't be used stand alone,"This course is a good complementary for Pimsler's course.It is build as talking dictionary: English word - Spanish word, with very littlephrases and no conversations."
