5,SO FAR SO GOOD,"It's a very good DVD player. At first I thought that Multizone was from the beggining, but don't.I ask my dealer about it and tell me to search the code to unlock it on the web. So I find this place: [...], where my DVD model was, and gave two methods. I try de first one but didn't work, but with de second one (the easier)voila!!! The great method is 0. Method 2:1. Open tray2. Press 9, 9, 9, 9, 0Incredible, now my DVD reads everything that I want.great!!!"
2,Philips Dvp3040,The audio ouput is so low it makes it virtually useless. The Toshiba models blow it away!
1,Not Exactly Region Free!,I just purchased this DVD player based on reviews I read on this site. I tried to play a DVD from England (Region 2 + 4) and an error message appeared Wrong Region! Hardly what I would call region free. If anybody knows a way to make it work I would be very grateful.
4,Shock Waves DVD Debut,"For many years, Peter Cushing Fans Have sought a copy of this low-budget movie. Now! It's finaly here. Peter Cushing and John Cardine, two of the great Masters of Horror, along side a cast of good actors made this film a classic from begining to end. Fan of the genre, will love it. The restoration of the film isn't perfect but it's 100 time better then the US video tape version, that existed year ago.The story is original and very eerie. Peter Cushing fans will love to see it again, and again and for the first time on DVD and Wide-Screen. I'm not going to reader digest the story and tell you parts of the story lines. You probably, already know it. All I'll say is this. It's a great Peter Cushing Movie and a great film for anyone who like this genre. GREAT CLASSIC!"
3,Shock Waves B rated,"This movie was okay for what I consider a B rated movie. I bought it for my mom, who asked me what I thought of it. She likes those old scary movies.Sound: The sound thoughout the movie was well placed. No issues.Scenery: The scenery was marvelous, beautiful natural environment.Characters: The characters were not believable at all. It was a joke to see these actors in action. I actually had to stop watching because it was so bad, but I finished later on.Plot: A special forces squad of Nazi SS Zombies are coming to kill you, they were not told their side lost the war.Price: This movie is worth the low price, especially if you want a laugh.Overall: I did not like this movie, but my mom loves it. If you like old horror movies that do not deliver, this is for you."
1,"The ""joke"", never funny, is now painfully shabby",It is sad that a person who apparently had too much money and time to waste could have done so in preserving for an unsuspecting posterity such awful sounds. The so-called friends who flocked by invitation to her concert to relish an event of mockery were at least as much to blame as the poor woman herself for having encouraged such eccentric egocentricity.The whole matter stinks of making fun of a person afflicted by illness. What a cruel species we were - and still are.
5,Very Good,"My company just started using DTS and I needed to learn the technology rapidly. While many Wrox books are 1000+ pages, this book is actually 683. The rest of the pages are devoted to appendixes on the object models.Another strength of this book is the construction of the chapters. After the introductory 2 chapters, the rest can be read in any order or skipped. This book covered many diverse topics, including data warehouse loading, the DTS object model, VBScript, and even using VB to build new custom tasks.The book is primarily focused on DBAs. Therefore, there is more coverage of VBScript and COM object development than a programmer would require. However, given the strong chapter cohesiveness, it is easy to skip this material without missing important information."
2,Preliminary Review,"I have just started working through this book and I am already frustrated. This is one disorganized book. The authors like to jump around a lot. When they are explaining a concept (exporting data using a wizard), they jump to a different topic right in the middle and come back to the original thread may be a couple of pages later. This is extremely dis-orienting since you are trying to follow along with the wizard.I will post a complete review later."
2,Forget about this.,"Expect to see ""foobar"",""Hello world"", ""The time is blah blah blah"" and all that useless examples. This book is entitled ""Professional"" SQL Server 2000 DTS but you will end up getting (chicken) scratch on the surface: it tells you little about everything. Good only if you are a in the management, it will make you sound like you know what you are talking about. if you are a developer, better off find something else."
3,Not very good book,"First the book is of 670 pages long and not 800 as advertised in the title of Amazon page. Second the author explanations are not clear and detailed. For instance, he doesn't supply good examples for most difficult concepts of COM ATL like aggregation."
1,Boring...,"Gay Erotica should be entertaining, stimulating, and fun to read. Sadly, this book misses the mark on all levels.I found it boring, non-stimulating, and just plain uninteresting. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
5,Arm yourself with a great tool,"Dieting is very tough. Why not arm yourself with a great tool. Mastercook provides nutritional information in a snap.Mastercook can help those who count calories, those who count food exchanges, and is helpful for Weight Watchers Folks gather information so they can then determine their points. I have owned several versions of MasterCook. This version is a great update to a super program. This will enable you to store recipes, and catagorize them as you wish. You will be able to email recipes to other people online. MasterCook comes with great recipes, and many of them have photos. MasterCook will help you generate shopping lists, saving you time, and it will help you scale recipes.Another aspect about this program that is extremely helpful is if you enjoy mailing lists, there are tons out there. I bet you have noticed that many people send their stuff in Mastercook format. You can email straight from Mastercook, and IMPORT recipes as well."
3,Bad carriage,"The printer arrived in time, was well packed, & in it's self functions ok, but the printer cartridge carriage was cruddy & cloged with old dried ink & is utterly useless, & it will cost me as much as I paid for the printer to get another one!"
3,no subwoofer volume control is a dealbreaker,"It's a nice speaker set, except for one huge problem, no separate volume control for the subwoofer. That is a dealbreaker, because there are sometimes you want to lower the bass, and it's not possible. I'm upgrading to a similar class of speakers but with a subwoofer control."
4,Awesome speaker set!,"The Altec Lansing ACS33 Power Cube speaker system is a very nice solution to anyone's computer audio needs. I am a Flash developer and your common everyday music enthusiest so sound is very important to me in my work. These sleak sattelite speakers and sub-woofer deliver crisp, powerful, and LOUD sound. I can also say that they surprised me with the quality of sound they give while set on the lowest volume setting, while barely audible. I only have two minor gripes, however, that keep this product from 5-stars. Music highs sound a bit weak and syntehtic from the desktop speakers, while the sub-woofer is also a bit weak and has no level control of its own (which, in my eyes, is a major problem with most sub-woofers). While these short comings can be contained with a equalizer program, they really shouldn't have appeared at all. But aside from these very minor problems, this system shines as a lost cost system with a lot of power!"
1,Her voice keep waking me up!,"The lady's voice in the mp3 keep swinging upward. Each time she does it and she wake me up! By the end of the 1st song, I am so tired and stressed I just want to throw the MP3 away! Can't believe I acutally pay for such a thing... :("
1,I Really Hated This CD,"I was looking for something that would relax me so I could fall asleep. This CD had the oppisite affect on me. She talks very fast, almost like she is just rushing through the whole thing and the music in the background is horrible. The whole thing gave me a massive headache. I will not be using this CD ever again."
2,Good content but high pitched voice makes it hard to relax,"The author provides some good guidance into relaxation, but I was not able to relax due to high pitched voice and changes in volume throughout the session."
3,Labor Pains,"Having a baby is no easy task. If your baby happens to be a demon child, you can't even imagine what you're in for. ""Born"" is a D-level horror film that attempts to capture that experience.A young virgin awakes one morning and is miraculously pregnant with a demon child. The father of said devil baby is one of hell's demons, who needs the child to be born so he can regain his soul. What unfolds during the hour and forty minutes of labor (pun intended) is never truly explained.""Born"" is a mediocre horror film at best. The potential was there for this film to be much better than average. But, the poorly written dialogue, sub par acting and numerous plot holes were to overwhelming to go unnoticed."
5,Depth!,"Providence is depth. Everything within the system is incredably detailed and Clif-Spider is a book to see. History, maps, groups, organizations, politics, power structure, military, everything! All in one book, presented in an absolutely gorgeous format. The writing crew (Danny Budge, Chris Charet, Alex Leonard with Michael Scott) have written a cohesive, documented fantasy city. If you play Providence, or even are just looking for an excellent city setting, PICK THIS UP. It will amaze you!"
1,There's much better out there,"The authors are so eager to be funny and serious, they end up failing on both counts. Facts and jokes are delivered much the same way, making the book prone to misunderstandings. Particularly if you aren't already familiar with Dutch culture.If you want to learn about the Dutch and get to understand them better, read ""Dealing with the Dutch"" by Vossestein or ""The Low Sky"" by Van der Horst. For a really funny read, go with ""Xenophobe's Guide to the Dutch"" by Bolt."
4,Honest straight forward critique of The Netherlands,"Even though I'm Dutch, and the authors make a lot of fun of my countrymen and me, it is quite an informative book. You never are able to see the idiosyncrasies of your country and yourself until someone buys you a book like this. Great present for people who have AMERICAN friends living in the Netherlands, or for people who have to work with the Dutch. Not recommended as a present to a Dutch person, unless they have been living in another country for a while."
3,Not really accurate,"Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, I don't see what was so funny in this book. Instead, it reads to me more like a xenophobe's guide to the Netherlands, and not in a very good way.The chapters talking about the odd Dutch houses made me laugh - and you would too if you saw these crazy narrow stairs!!! But when they discussed the attitude of the Dutch I thought they were a bit off the mark.With a very few exceptions, I have had nothing but positive experiences here. I have yet to see a protest, or be faced with undue bureaucracy despite having obtained permanent residency. However, the book was first written in the 80's, and updated periodically since. I wonder if some of the attitudes portrayed by the writers belongs to another era, or another generation.So, at the end of the day, given the glaring inaccuracies based on my own experiences, I cannot recommend this book. Maybe I took the book too seriously, and that is entirely possible, however I did not enjoy reading it."
4,Well Done Singer/Songwriter Songs,"I discovered Ian North from the free Paste Magazine CD. This CD is great. Ian has a warm, rich voice and is influenced by Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. Anyone looking for excellent tunes done in the singer/songwriter genre - - get this CD now!"
2,Preposterous!,"I haven't finished this yarn yet, but I peeked so I know the ending. I agree with the only reviewer that stated it was unbelievable. That anyone could accomplish what one man did in the short time he did it is totally unbelivable. To think he could just waltz into the drug world and have free reign to do what he did is way beyond believe.. Even trained narcotic agents can't pull it off but this guy could and did. Well on to the next fairy tale with the boogey man."
3,White Cargo,"I didn't know the book was written in 1988,the time frame was not working out right until he said they could have lunch with Nancy Reagen. I've read most of Stuart Wood's book but I always fine little things wrong with them. In this book they flew to Santa Marta but then are driving around in the Bronco again. It's like they don't have proof readers, this was not just a typo. Not his best work but keeps you reading."
4,White Cargo by Stuart Woods,"I read this book years ago when it first came out. Exciting story...a page-turner. Stuart Woods recent books usually have Stone Barrington as the main character. The stories are aways good and are quick reading, but I like some of Stuart Woods stand-alone earlier books as well. I reread this and truly enjoyed it. My husband recently read Palindrome and enjoyed it also. I wil continue to read his new books as they come out, but recommend discovering some of his earlier works also....much more diversified."
2,No delivery for 'White Cargo',"Hmmm, I'm not really sure what to think of this book! At the beginning and all the way through the book I was glued to it--a fathers desperate attempt to locate his missing daughter, what more did it need? Hmmm, let me think. I got it! a better ENDING. I ended up being very disappointed, and have not returned to read another one of Woods books."
5,A must have for mornings,"I tried these after a friend suggested them. I found that not only was I more alert and awake, but my memory improved and I was more focused and productive for several hours afterwards."
3,Found better than this,"When I tried this there was a surge of euphoria but then nothing the next times.When I say ""nothing the next times"" I don't mean that it wasn't a euphoric experience each additional time, I mean that it literally had NO effect after the first time.It may work better for others, so gave it 3 stars so as not to bring down the rating unfairly.A better combo I found is 5htp and L-tyrosine along with intense workouts and a good multivitamin (animal pak)."
3,Not sure yet,GOt it really fast thank you. I have only taken it a couple days now so I am thinking I need to take it longer to see any real results. I was told I definetely have adult ADHD but didnt take the medication because of my job. I am trying to see if this works as well as other people say it will.
4,Amateur cake decorator,"I just took a cake decorating class and was greatly inspired to try it at home. I found that other kits claiming to have 50 plus pieces were overwhelming! This set, however, is great for a novice such as myself. It includes the basic tips used in class as well as the more intricate ones used to make flowers. Also, I love this set because it is ALL tip -- I already have bags and spatulas and so forth. Other kits are full of things other than tips which one can pick up ""a la cart"" inexpensively. I also love Wilton as they are the leaders in baking products. Great diversity in this set. I only wish there were one extra coupler."
2,Flimsy,"Maybe I'm stronger than I think, but I've had two of these and both of them broke within a month. I had the white one and also a stainless finished one. On both, the black band around the middle began coming off on my hands.Worse, though, on both of mine the chamber cracked around the edge, making it impossible to pressure the spray. Believe me, I'm no gorilla and I didn't overdo it, at least not according to the instructions.I've gone back to a regular little pump sprayer."
1,Save Your Money,"I have owned a Misto for a while and, as others have, I noticed the way the quality of the spray deteriorated over time so that you would only get a stream of oil, instead of a mist. Well, this morning, my Misto exploded while I was using it to make pancakes (periodically spraying the pan during the process). Luckily, no one was hurt, but there is a dent in my kitchen ceiling where the top hit it, upon being expelled from the base with great force. I would estimate the BANG that accompanied the explosion was 85-90 decibels. I will definitely not buy another Misto based on today's explosion, but even before this, I was rather ho-hum about the product anyway. My advice: save your money."
1,Smells like epoxy,Brand new out of package and the inside smells like epoxy. Makes me nervous to use this to spray on my food. It's getting returned.
2,Nice outside but cheap innards.....,"Broken after a year. Way too expensive for what it doesn't supply, mainly 'mist'. An overpriced 'toy'. Customer service is excellent, however, and the broken part was replaced at no charge.I agree with one of the other reviewers...If the oil is heavy, such as EVOO, the oil will come out in a stream. The best I can say is that the Misto might make an adequate plant mister."
2,Slick Trick,"I bought the sleek stainless-steel MISTO hoping to upgrade my humble cheap plastic spray bottle, a water mister which came FREE as part of an insulating window film application kit. To my disapointment, I'm sorry to say, MISTO performed much worse. The purported power pump produced only one or two fine sprays at best; but often, there was no spray at all, or only a lame spurt. I was shocked, as my plain plastic bottle, which has no pump per se--only a plain conical pump nozzle--sprays better and better the emptier the bottle gets. I think you can get one at a hair salon products store for less than a buck. I also tried an oil sprayer recycled from a nontoxic suntan oil bottle, but it worked poorly as well, only spurting, not misting. The water bottle has a THICKER tube, I notice, so maybe that's the key. None of these really WORK in the true sense of the word, though."
3,Kinda like audio oatmeal.,"The good stuff is actually mediocre stuff, with the obvious exception of Busy Child. I absolutely despise Atari Teenage Riot, and caution those who choose to purchase this cd not to listen to the last track without a handfull of prozac and a barf bag handy."
3,"Good, but limited","The only gripe I have about this CD is the same ritual with MTV; They edit and shorten some of the best songs!. It's got great mmusic though. Prodigy, The Crystal Method and Apex twin have some of the best stuff on AMP."
4,beautiful photos,"I really liked this book for the photography and ideas--IO would have liked it more with more projects and how to directions! It is beautiful, though"
1,lame,"I ordered this for an interactive instructional dvd in Spanish for my class to follow, but was very let down by a poor-quality recording and and outdoor space- not even in a studio! A waste of my money."
3,a good necessary source.,This book is a necessary source for a scientist who are studying astrophysics. But I have got some criticism.These are; 1- this book is very expencive 2- The pictures is less for visual and to imagine. I wanted to have a lot of pictures moreover these pictures may be colour.But the content and the explain kind are good in this book. These ideas belong to me. Thank you for C.G.Campbell.
1,"Nice folks, dull story.","I found the characters in this sleepy little town quite nice; human, normal, likeable, not unlike the folks in my northeastern New York home. However, to me the pace was incredibly slow, and I agree with ""A Reader from Boston"" that I ""slogged my way through this waiting for something, ANYTHING, that would catch my attention."" I was unable to finish the book. I shared it with a coworker who also gave up half way through. It now resides in our company ""lending library."""
2,"Oldie, but not so goodie","I saw this sci fi as youngster and was fascinated by fx @ the end. But the plot, acting, etc. as I matured was not so bueno."
2,Recent purchaser,Nice pan but it leaks. The sides of the pan do not conform well to the base resulting in serious leaking of the cake mix. To use this pan you must put another pan under it to catch the leak or you will have cake all over the bottom of your stove.
4,Excellent Text for reading around the topic.,"I used Lovelock's ""Services Marketing"" as a text and this book as a backup for my services marketing module in a Masters of Business Studies Course. It would be easily as useful at undergraduate level. The book is a compilation of good industry articles by well respected authors including David Maister, Berry, Zeithaml and Parasuraman, Sandra Vandermerwe and Peter Drucker to name but a few. The articles are arranged by topic into eight sections as follows: Challenge of Services, Understanding Services, Design and Delivery, Managing capacity and demand, Search for Quality, Adding value through customer service, the human dimension in services management, Strategy and Integration. Each section has three or more articles followed by a couple of relevant case studies where you can track the issues in real environments. All in all a very useful text and a valuable reference work on my office bookshelf."
4,Good beginner set,"Bought as a gift. It looks quite nice for the price. This will be an excellent kit for a beginner, and will probably be all a beginner needs for tips for a long time. I would not consider the packaging it comes in to be a storage tray, as it is flimsy and is really just a package insert in my opinion. The booklet is actually more of a brochure. However, overall it is a veryu useful and nice set."
2,"Software is useless, Card okay","The card installed and works fine. The software on the otherhand is useless. I mistakenly believed the reviews I read here and other places, including CNET and even the articles on ADS's site. I'm not sure what sort of editing these people are used to but NLE software should do far more than allow for single track sound editing and confine users to basic cutting tools with very little control of the video clips. Horrible, useless software package. I regret being cheap. Spend the money for a good Firewire card that comes with useful software, like Premiere."
3,It's a great show,"Tyne Daly is not the best singer to ever play Mama Rose, but she is a wonderful actress, although that sadly doesn't come out on the album. The production values are very high though so all of the songs are very enjoyable and the supporting cast is outstanding,"
2,Forgettable...,"Not the best revival, and certainly not the best overall. I don't remember much except that Tyne Daly, despite clear devotion to the role, has a voice that, to my ears, sounds weak, forced and occasionally off-key. Supporting cast members are so-so. This must be a very difficult role to sing, as even Roberta Peters falls flat (despite some exceptionally interesting interpretation). In my opinion, Patty Lupone's rendition is the best of the recent revivals, but Ethel Merman is still ""The Mama"" (after all these years)..."
3,all he needs is the girl!,"I own four versions of GYPSY, the original with Merman being my favorite. Though Tyne Daly has the least strong of the Mama Rose voices, this production is excellent. In particular the young man who performs ""All I Need is the Girl"" is just brilliant, this is the best version I've ever heard of that wonderful song."
4,"The Definitive ""Mama Rose""","Tyne Daly is absolutely perfect in the role created for the brash belter, Ethel Merman. I personally find Merman's songs empty and hollow. But Tyne's renditions of this powerful and popular score are phenomenal. Her ""Rose's Turn"" is simply the best ever. It beats out Bernadette Peters' and Angela Lansbury's versions. Her voice was hoarse and coarse when this CD was recorded because she was very ill at the time. So this album is not a true mirror of what her performance was. But even through her illness, you get the emotion and pain in Rose's songs. Absolutely Perfect! As long as you don't mind the sound of Tyne's ""sick"" voice, which is only bad in certain spots, I say get this recording.Gypsy Recordings to Buy:1. Tyne Daly2. Bernadette Peters3. Angela Lansbury4. Ethel Merman5. Bette Midler's TV movie"
1,Dreadful!,"The worst performance of Mama Rose ever recorded. Have seen amatuer productions of Gypsy where the leading lady was better than Daly. Though she is an accomplished and talented actress, this was a huge mistake. She CAN'T sing it. Don't beleive the story that she was ill when they made the recording, saw it on stage and she sang it even worse. Get Lansbury's recording for the definitive version."
5,Beautiful Tribute,"This album from one of the world's greatest organists, John Scott, is one of the most beautiful musical tributes to those who lost their lives in 9/11. The Nunc Dimittis is one of the most haunting versons of this traditional prayer ever written."
4,DON'T BUY IT ONLY BECAUSE OF JEFF BERLIN,"You'll probably be disappointed like I was. You can barely listen to his bass playing, the bass sound seems lost in the background of instruments, it's almost inaudible. And in the few moments when you do listen to it, all you can hear is a distorted, awful bass sound. The CD is a must for Yes fans but not for Jeff Berlin fans."
2,Pretty bland,There isn't a single hit for which he is famous. He recorded thousands of albums---this is not one worth having.
4,Bush Songs from Australia,This was a fun product to listen too. The songs are not common and it was something even my Australian friends found enjoyable.
4,tennis strategy,A book of tennis strategy. Some of it I am familiar with and others it was a good review. A good complement to Brad Gilbert's Ugly Tennis.
1,Connie Francis at the copa,Horrible! Waited extra time for this album ! Gave it to my honey for fathers day - sure wish I had not given it to him it was terrible !
5,"Quality pan, recommended","This is nice heavy weight and quality pan. My primary reason to purchase is to use it as a liner for a ""10 inch cast iron dutch oven..."
4,First rate Franco and neat DVD,"Sure, the quality of the English is not all that great but this is one of Jesus Franco's best in recent years. It's an action drama with a decent degree of intrigue and some nice comic moments. Rachel Sheppard is a cutie who could be the next darling of the Franco set. Lina Romay looks and acts vicious as the chief female baddie. Even Linnea Quigley is in this. She's looks great and does a fine job in an remarkably straight dramatic role. One Shot Productions delivers a few nice extras on the DVD too with some rough but interesting behind the scenes bits. Even if you hate Franco, and plenty of us do, you could do worse that this interesting potboiler about an ex-patriate writer (Sheppard) returning to her native country on a book tour only to be kidnapped and swept up in a plot of political assassination. Heady stuff for Franco!"
1,What a horrendous movie,"I just wasted my 5 bucks on this horrendous dvd, the worst movie I ever watched. Terrible plot, terrible acting and terrible audio."
3,Short and concise look at fountain pens,"Small hardback book contains some description of fountain pens made by some companies. I was surprised that Conway Stewart pens were left out. Personally, I believe that Conway Stewart pens were very important in fountain pen history. It is a good book for amateurs collecting fountain pens, but not so great for people with more knowledge in the field. Warmly recommend."
3,Air Bud,I was charge for two day delivery and it didn't get there on time. I was not happy with that.
1,Did not work,Unfortunely both batteries sent by this company DIDN'T work in my laptop.I'm still waiting the refund.Mauro Szwarcwald
5,Interesting and Complex with a nice ending.,"This movie is the story of a boxer who portrays one image in front of his fans and another, rather opposite one, at home. It turns out his drinking gets him framed for a murder and even leads to people thinking he is deceased. Through a sequence of events he ends up out west in a ranch for troubled youth from New York. Of course, there is a beautiful lady there and he falls in love. Rather too aggressively at first, but in the end he is redeemed as are the youngsters. It is a good story with a nice message. Very much worth the while."
4,A Good Story Well Told,"I have always enjoyed this film and think it is one of John Garfield's best during his Warners years. I am always drawn to films of the outsider who finds a family with whom he can be a part. I was very taken by Gloria Dickson and checked to see whatever became of her. I was very sad to see she had died in a house fire in 1945. Although the great Claude Rains is miscast, he is by no means bad in the part. His actor's likability still comes through. According to the IMDb, he was forced to do the role although he knew he wasn't the best choice for such a part. Max Steiner's wonderful sentimental score adds significantly to the emotion especially toward the film's end. It's a decent, honest film that tries to be nothing more than what it is."
3,Solid Sequel,"Sometimes film companies outdo themselves the second time around and sometimes they don't. The latter happened with Prince of Darkness.It is a good solid Hammer production, but I guess(hmmmm)we are missing something here that would have made this a better sequel:CUSHING! Okay plot about stranded travelers who wind up you know where and they meet you know who!"
4,"The Third Of The Hammer Dracula Films: Dracula, Prince Of Darkness","TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good:Dracula Prince of Darkness is great! There is a dramatic staking scene. There is a cool ressurection scene, with lots of blood. The final demense is awsome, and unexpected. One of my favorite Hammer films. Christopher Lee used cool blood red contact lenses. GREAT WORK HAMMER!!!The Bad:Hammer waited eight years to bring Christopher Lee back, but in those eight years they thought up a great movie!I also recomend: The Hammer Dracula Films!SEE OLDDARK HOUSE'S GUIDE!FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer!"
5,Cheap at twice the price,"Really, only $999.00 for this movie. How could one possibly resist. Why, if I could get every one of the Hammer Dracula movies for this price I could be all in for under $10,000. Awesome"
4,Great Popcorn and a Good Overall Value for the Cost,"After converting our underground basement into a home theater, one of the final touches to make this project complete was a Antique Popcorn Machine. Being on a limited budget, I did a lot of research and finally settled on the Great Northern Red Roosevelt 8 Ounce Popcorn Machine. Upon receipt, I was a bit disappointed but had to continually remind myself of the cost verses a top end machine. Assembly took less than one hour and we had a fully functional popcorn machine for our home theater. If you are looking for a budget popcorn machine for your home theater, I can recommend this as a decent quality machine for the money."
2,Shame on Disney,"I bought this set because my daughter so enjoyed her other video, ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (which seems to be out of print now). I didn't realize that this set is essentially a repackaging of the same material from that video (1 of the 4 tapes is new material). I much prefer the original tape to this set - there are a lot of ads at the beginning of every tape, so the ""ads to watchable video"" ratio is extremely high in the set version. There were ads on the original tape, too, but you simply went through them once and then had essentially 3 tapes of uninterrupted watchable video. This set is clever packaging that makes it look like you're getting a lot at a good price, when in fact you're essentially getting one movie over multiple tapes and 4 times the amount of ads that you would normally see."
4,COOL,"This stuff is SO Manring! I love it! It trancends being a ""bass album"" and is truly just ""cool music""Awesome grooves, great solos, and a couple of the solo bass pieces are REALLY awesome. A good one!"
1,Garbage,You have heard this stuff already if you listen to radio friendly garbage over the last 10 years. Don't touch this trash with a ten foot pole.....you have been warned.
4,Ezra Pound,"Eustace Mullins biography of and recollections of his friendship with the world reknowned poet Ezra Pound. Pound was also political prisoner who was arrested by the US government for making ""pro-fascist"" radio broadcasts during ww2. They knew the charges wouldn't stick in a court so they had him commited to a mental hospital where he was imprisoned for years."
1,No es yoga!,"I am a yoga instructor and I bought this to learn how to teach in Spanish. This DVD would be good for someone who wants an exercise and stretching class, but this is not yoga."
5,A+++++++,ordered for my wife and she loved it. any time a company makes it easy to keep my wife happy they are great for me.thanks
4,Great Buy,This was the best product ever. The only reason I give it a 4 is because (like some other ppl suggested) they only provided the small couplers and some of the tips are bigger. What I realize in the baking world is that you can never get all your tools or information in the same place. There are some tips that we might consider important that are not in this set. There are leaf tips that are missing and I think the nails they included are too small. THIS IS NOT A TOTAL PACKAGE. You will STILL have to go out and buy additional tips. It was worth it still.
3,Downhill,"This is pretty good, but not up to the standards of previous seasons. I think the 7th season is the first that wasn\t better than the season that was before it. It's still one of the best, but this was the begining of the downhill slide for Friends. At least in my opinion."
2,I agree with Carmarthen,"I agree with reviewer Carmarthen. People tend to mix the characters with the actors. The cast of FRIENDS are really greedy people, negotiating payment increases season after season (I don't suffer for the NBC money, but I think it's a good point)."
2,This is why season 7 is regarded as the worst:,"Be it his drug problems, or perhaps other influences, Matthew Perry's Chandler stopped being Chandler and started being a guy that was trying to do a Chandler impression. It was downright awful. I challenge any Friends fanatic to watch season 7 and not notice a drastic difference in Perry's delivery. Awful. Simply atrocious. Add to that Monica becoming a shrill, annoying joke of a character, and you have what amounts to the worst season of Friends ever. This is the year I wrote off Friends for good."
3,"Great sytle, bad fit","The boots arrived just as pictured, they are beautiful.And that's where my satisfaction ends. I am fifty years old and wear a size 11. These boots are a full inch too long. They look like cowboy boots.Comfort was a big selling point in the advertisement. Yet after walking around my carpeted bedroom for five minutes, my feet began to hurt. The boots have a raised heel with no arch support. These boots remind me of a girl I once dated. She was beautiful, but too much of a pain. I can not return these boots fast enough.Terribly disapointed."
4,Just A Little Different Hank,"Not the usual attitude-filled CD from Hank but it's still Hank. There are a few faster songs but mostly blues-type stuff. I give it 4 stars 'cause I want some more rowdy stuff from him. There is a little spoken word at the beginning of some of the songs. There is some good history/story stuff in the liner notes and a couple of older pictures. It has been said on some other website reviews that it was recorded in the Almeria Building so I was a little leary of the quality of the sound, don't worry, it sounds great. Really good quality, it doesn't have a ""live"" sound to it or anything. All in all, if you're a Hank fan you really don't need my recommendation to buy this CD, if you're not and you like his older stuff, this may not be the CD to start with."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made - But it's so FUNNY!!!,"Not to be mistaken with Madonna's Truth or Dare which is also bad but not as funny. This story centres around a man who for some reason ends up plaing Truth or Dare out in the woods with a large breasted hitch hiker and is unable to JUST SAY NO!, when it comes to the dare part of the game.He ends up in a mental institution, after his wife cheats on him..? Doesn't make sense....I know....plays Truth or Dare with some inmates, pulling weapons out of God knows where....the whole movie is like this. In the hospital he magically produces a grenade, a bowie knife, and a gun....when he breaks out of the hospital the car he steals is loaded with a shot gun, an axe, a chainsaw and nunchucks....why??? Who's car was this. And for some reason that only the movie makers can explain, for half the movie the killer is wearing a ""bronze"" mask...the plastic moves in and out when he breaths!!!So funny! If you are a fan of cheese, buy it, rent it, love it!It has no equal."
2,Color looks a darker red than on the box,"I colored my hair with Natural Instincts Cinnaberry (I usually use Spiced Tea I found later), and though my hair is shiny and healthy, it looks an unnatural red, almost burgundy in color. I did not do a strand test because I thought it was the red color I usually use. Clairol tried to help me by telling me to put NI's Hazelnut over it, but now it's just darker with the ruby red color still showing over all."
1,This stuff is awful,"My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same. I have ashy blonde-brown hair. It bleached my hair into this awful shade of orange-red. Terrible! There should be a warning on it! I'll be complaining to clairol."
1,Not worth your time,"I have medium brown, undyed, healthy hair. I bought this hoping for a little extra shine. It was a kit similar to a hair dye. I used it exactly as instructed. My hair is no shinier, and seems a little more coarse than before. It may have lightened my hair one shade but it's hard to tell. This product was a disappointment and I will never buy it again."
1,Contains peroxide and will alter your existing color,"This is NOT a treatment that will make your hair healthier! It contains peroxide, which will lift your natural color! DEFINITELY stay away from this if you want your virgin hair to remain undamaged."
1,Seller sent old hair color,"I cannot rate that actual product, but I can warn people not to purchase it from Impossible Discounts, because they sent me Clairol Natural Instincts 24 medium cool brown which was manufactured in 2003 (it has a shelf life of only 3 years and it is November of 2011 now). The only reason I found out about its age is because of a manufacturer's coupon that was inside the box that had an expiration date of 12/31/04, so I called Clairol customer service and provided them with a number on the bottom of the hair color box, they advised me that it was manufactures in 2003. After numerous emails to the seller where he first suggested I try the hair color and if it doesn't work, then he will refund me for it, I sent it back for a refund but was not refunded for return shipping, so I paid $9.49 for the hair color and and $4.04 to send it back, great deal don't you think? My advice is to get your hair color from somewhere else."
2,"Used to be red, now eggplant","Under the old name, Cinnaberry, the Medium Auburn was my perfect color. When I applied it this last time, under the new name, Medium Auburn, I noticed it looked ""ash."" Indeed, the new shade is eggplant, not red. What a shame. Now, I have to go on a merry chase to find a true red. Meanwhile, my hair is somewhat porous and sucked up this dark purple mess. Boo hiss."
1,It did not work for me,I found no way to make it work with my IBM Thinkpad Transnote running Win2K. Once properly installed computer freezes to death...
3,Something was missing.......,"Overall, the video delivers as advertised. However, I purchased this video for one reason -- to see Jen Johnson who is currently a contestant on ""BIG BROTHER 8"".Unfortunately, the amount of screen-time Jen had was next to nothing compared to other ladies in the contest. It left me wanting more."
5,I love this movie!!!,"This is such a good movie!!!!!!I love the newborn puppies-they're just soooo cute!!!!!!!!Like the other kid said, interestingly enough my golden retriever watched the movie and seemed to like the puppies!"
1,I Am Disappointed,I was hoping this would be a nice alternative for my grandkids to a real soccer ball. I was very disappointed to find I had to air it up by blowing into a straw then sticking a plug it. I would fear giving it to young children because the plug would be a choking hazard. Trying to plug it while the air is releasing is a big disappointment and I had to leave the straw inside. No instructions whatsoever as how to air up the ball or whether to leave the straw in or out. There was just a photo of a woman blowing into the straw on the back of the package. I had to try several times and still did not get enough air inside of it. Save your money it is not worth it. It comes with two plugs.
4,Not Great,"I love listening to Chopin and especially to his Nocturnes; however, I prefer the more mechanical style of Artur Rubinstein and always choose to listen to it over this. To my ear, Moravec's playing sounds messy - as though someone had taken the meter and adjusted each beat by a tiny, random amount. Since others seem in love with his recordings, I guess the conclusion is to listen before you buy (or buyer beware)"
4,Atlas,"This was a cool item... Good history on the area, nice maps. Information on different ages good. My 10 year old Lord of the Rings son liked it. He has always wanted more maps"
4,"The description is misleading, but product is good","The lights are very bright, this is good for many uses besides just reading. May be annoying while reading for some.The description of product states that on 3AAA batteries one can obtain 70 hours of light, however, on the packaging, it states ""35 hours"". This is odd. Maybe I missunderstood, but it is in black and white.light weight plastic, pretty cool and easy to bend. Can clip to pants and use to walk at night.:)"
2,Shenandoah and Ashokan Farewell,"It is extremely difficult to find a instrumental version of Shenandoah; to which this CD has. I personally hope that a Civil War Brass Band will play this as an instrumental. A Civil War folk song; it has more meaning to those who are near the Shenandoah mountains and river. In the Native American Indian's translation--it means ""Daughter of Stars.""The Ashokan Farewell instrumental, as is played; there is no better to be found. I am of the belief, that Ken Burn's ""Civil War"" will be forever linked to this music.The rest of the music, in my opinion--is better played by the Americus Brass Band and Camp Chase Fife and Drum Corps. By using the authentic type drums; it makes a huge difference on the entire 'recipe' of the music piece/selection.If you're not fussy and not hungry for period instruments only--then it would be a higher ranking."
2,Fragments,"Never buy a soundtrack out of it's context. As a qualified Civil War buff I can easily relate to material even if incomplete and fragmentary. It is all too obvious that this is a soundtrack, hence, listen to it while viewing the documentary. Get some other new renditions of old songs from somewhere else."
3,"Worth a watch, but not epic.","This was a three DVD set. The first DVD was a made for TV special hosted by Charlton Heston. This first episode was very good and held my interest, as a fan of studying OOPARTs.The second DVD looked like it was primarily made with cutting room floor material from the first one, but was a quite good expansion with just a little bit of new material.The third disk dealt with what I saw not as OOPARTs, but with hoaxes. There was a little bit of interesting material here, lots of new footage, but overall, I'm not sure the third one was worth watching.Sadly the third disk drug down what would have been a four star rating for the first disk to a three."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"This... on HDTV... is just like in an IMAX! I'm an earth science teacher, and I can tell you this mesmerized the class. In fact, it's great for life science as well."
3,The fun doesn't last,"I bought this game as a Risk fanatic expecting a whole new game with new exciting challenges. It was not. Although the game was still fun because it's Risk and it had great graphics it wasn't enough to keep my intrest too long. It's just normal Risk with the add-on ""Same Time Risk"" which isn't very fun, just confusing. If you haven't already bought a Risk CD I strongly recomend buying the origonal because of Ultamate Risk which can keep your eyes glued to the computer screen for mounths."
1,Dont buy,This one is too hard to make level as you are dragging through the cake . I wish I would have spent more for a better one
2,Go with something else,"I have been meaning to buy a clip on book light for years. Reading in bed until all hours while my husband is trying to sleep was getting old....for him! So, I bought this one and was immediately disappointed. The clip doesn't stay stable unless you clip it onto 30 or so pages, the flexible arm moves all over the place.....never ever does it stay still. The light is too bright and when it falls off the book (which it often does), it shines right into my husband's face. This is the lamest, saddest excuse for a book light imaginable. Please, don't get it!"
2,Not good,"My wife and I have gone through a few book lights, and this one, of the LED units, is the worst. The light is not bright enough to evenly illuminate the page of a paperback book. I find my eyes hurting after 20-30 minutes of reading because it is not bright enough. The clamp that holds it to the book requires about 30 pages, and even then it is not very stable and flops around. When we bought this unit, we bought two different brands to compare. The other brand/model was brilliant in design and performance compared to this unit, and cheaper to boot.Pros: LED battery lifeCons: Dim, poor coverage, frustrating clamp"
3,Need Instructions for Battery,"Once I discovered how to insert the battery the light was fine. Company really needs to include how to do that. If it weren't for a review on this page, I'd still be searching for how to make it work. Caused the product to have an average rating."
2,...Pablum,"Instrumentally, this album is killer. Martin Barr, Glenn Cornick, & Clive Bunker are among the best rock musicians around. Too bad the same can't be said for Ian Anderson's amateurish flute playing and the corny lyrics of the title track. Want to hear Tull at their best? Listen to Stand Up."
5,Not the kind you have to wind up on sunday,"I have owned this classic album on vinyl ,tape and now c.d. it is without doubt a wonderful and unique musical experience and certainly one of the top 20 albums of all time.I applaud all the American kids that saw the wonder and enjoyed the freshness of Ian Andersons compositions and revelled in Martin Barres rich guitar work, instead of jumping on the Jesus bandwagon and castigating the songs before delving into what Anderson was talking about. There was nothing similar to this before and there has been nothing like it since , it never grows old , a true sign of greatness.Funny thing was it came out at the same time as another gem , Tea for the Tillerman by Cat Stevens and these albums were a great joy to me when I was a green 20 yr old working in the wilderness. Enjoy."
2,"Great album, quality of sound re-production weak",Gotta love this album but very disappointed in the volume level it was reproduced at...granted my hearing has diminshed however you have to crank the stereo to the the highest levels ....:(Bill
3,Ennui...Ronfleur...zzzzz....,"I've never understood the facination some people have for this CD. It's good but definetly not Tull's best. I prefer ""This Was"", ""Stand Up"", and ""Benefit"" over this. The beginning of the end for Jethro Tull, it was all downhill after this. Despite the tedious lyrics, Martin Barr kicks [booty] and the rhythm section of Clive Bunker and Glenn Cornick is splendid."
4,Locomotive Breath,"The song is powerful and has static of its own. The first time I heard it I couldn't believe it was actually Jethro Tull till I heard the flute solo. Magnificent, that solo makes my teeth screech."
3,"Enough, yet not.","Fluke's fourth album leaves a little to be desired. While on a whole the songs are more consistent, (meaning they are all 3 star songs, with only a couple exceptions) there are only two great songs. The CD does have a lot of good points, Amp, and Goodnight Lover are beautiful pieces of work, tracks 2, 3, and 4 all connect, as do tracks 6-10. Only tracks 1, and 5 are completely stand-alone songs. The music is complex, and uses multiple sounds at once. Lyrics are used very sparingly, and very well.Worth getting, shows a lot of talent, but not as much enthusiasm as their previous CDs.-D"
5,Thank you VW Bug,"Thanks to the VW Bug's reverse engineering from UFO's, I heard Absurd and bought this album. This CD has very infectious beats that get the whole body moving. On its softer side, Fluke weaves sounds together that seen ethereal at times, and rock solid at others. This is a very solid showing that would fit in many a collection."
1,"Should have been named ""Flash for dummies""","If you are in the hypothetical hoolabaloo or are interested in Mr. Davis (who is very much interested in himself!), go buy this book. If you have never touched a computer and are totally new to Flash: buy this book. Otherwise: avoid like the plague. There are way better books on Flash then this!"
4,The Title says it all,"This is the third Don Casey book I've read and I like them all. Don has a easy going infomative style that doesn't come of as Mr. Know It All. His other books I've read were on maintenance related issues. This book is all about the emotions and realities of cruising. The chapter tiltes tell it all. ""What is cruising really like?"" ""Confronting fears"" ""stocking the galley"" etc. I have a hard time giving books five stars, but this is definitely a 4-1/2 star. It's only 170 some pages I'd like to see more. Would I buy again? Absolutely- If this title appeals to you the book will deliver. A two thumbs up!"
5,Beautiful introduction to geography,"This book beautifully illustrates geography in all its different forms, particularly the physical and cultural forms. What a delightful opportunity to sit down with your child and share the world of geography."
4,Well worth your time,"This is a (mostly) informative, well-researched group of essays focusing on new ideas of third genderism among pre-Conquest Americans. They are all pretty readable for the casual reader who knows something of history and queer theory. A caution to the casual reader (who may not care about the political fights in the field of Anthropology): the second essay is mean-sprited and strident, from a distinctly homophobic viewpoint. I'm not quite sure why it was included. So, skip it, and enjoy the rest."
2,Great movie horrible condition!,"I ordered this movie as a birthday present for my sister who used to love it as a kid. The case was cracked and the disc would not stay clicked in, was completely scratched before i even opened the case! i was so Embarrassed to give that to her after i opened the box to see that. At that point it was too late to replace considering they do not carry it in stores but i am very disappointed."
1,Wish I could send this back.,"I idea behind this is good, but it did not work the way I wanted. I followed the directions to the T. Unfortunately this just did not work. I sprayed the item with Pam but the hearts are so small that nothing looked good after being baked in this. It has been sitting in a box ever since. Maybe it would be good for candy making."
4,Good product,"It fits perfectly in my Ford Ranger 2.3 L 1996, for small drums, its a full kit for your rear drums brakes, be sure to install correctly, I had some issues with the adjustment, and still have problems when I release the parking brake..."
2,This should be a pamphlet,"This should be a pamphlet, not a book. You could read the whole thing in 20 minutes. There are like 3 sentences on each page. It has helpful information, but it's overly simplistic -- like it was written for a third grader. Save your money and don't buy this intro book. If you are interested in the Love and Logic parenting philosophy, just buy one of the other (longer) books in the series."
5,"Helicopters, Drill Sergants and Consultants",Great book! I received it fast and it was a quick read. Thanks for getting this to me so quickly.
5,Read the book,"Reading this book gives you the positive point of view about how you can change your lifestyle and see a dramatic new person in the mirror in less than two weeks. Despite the quick success I had, the book does not emphasize immediate satisfaction, but rather focuses on long term lifestyle changes that make you not just lose weight in the form of fat, but feel better about yourself for the rest of your life. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age who wants a sensible balanced approach to longterm weight loss and lifestyle improvement."
2,Supplements too expensive,"It's not that simple, or original. The cost of the supplements, which are the mainstay of the program, made the program prohibitive if I wanted the claimed results. I was very disappointed."
3,Love triangle murder trial,Pretty good true story about a late-thirties well-to-do english woman who is married to a not-so-perfect man and finds herself a lover (younger sister's boyfriend). It all ends in tragedy with three out of the four people involved in these couples winds up dead.
3,Great when they work,"The title says it all. We purchased two of them for our small business, planning to buy more. One of them stopped functioning after just a couple of days. We returned it for replacement which was done expeditiously. The replacement is still working fine. However, the other one has now gone south. By any standard, this is an unacceptable reliability record. I will buy one more because I like these phones so much. But if the new one craters too, I will be forced to replace them with the bulkier Panasonic phone."
4,Back to the 6th grade!,"I have enjoyed this on tape for several years. In fact, I bring it into school where my fifth graders beg to listen. At school and at home we all love Bill Harley's songs and stories! I think we need more bus drivers like Mr. Anderson!"
2,not many interesting pics for babies,I ordered this dvd thinking there would be some attraction for my 17m toddler while i do my exercises but it is not enough at all! A few same floating pictures jump across the screen every now and then. My toddler gets bored and doesn't let me do the whole dvd so in the end i have to do my gym only after he sleeps. It is ok fitness program having all the basics covered. Not worth of 19 dollars though. Will go back to Leslie Sansone's workout dvds.
3,Didn't fit well into my schedule,"As a new mom who worked from home, I was excited to get Strollertime but never found much use for it. The walking CD was mostly instructional and I personally didn't find it motivational. As for the DVD the exercises were OK, but I agree that it wasn't entertaining for my baby which made it difficult to even finish a routine. A good concept, but has room for improvement."
5,For all moms!,"I originally bought this DVD for my sister, she just had her first child, and she is an avid exerciser. She loved it and recommended I purchase a copy for myself, as I am always struggling with how to find the time to exercise between work, volunteering, and my 2 small children. I am totally in love with the program. Since my kids are out of strollers, they bike while I walk with them. They actually look forward to mommy doing her ""exercises"" on the TV. My 6 year old likes to join in, while my 3 year old is entranced by the images that bounce across the screen. We've even created a game where they have a list of all the figures, and they try to check them off when they see them (this helps with reading skills, a BONUS!)I find the exercises challenging and adaptable. I am very happy with me purchase, and I recommend Strollertime to ALL moms, not just those with babies!"
3,A campy romp through the Mythos,"If you like the unremitting horror and cosmic indifference of H P Lovecraft, bordering on that of Nietzche then this is probably not for you. If you like the work but don't take it or yourself too seriously, you will certainly enjoy this and other takes on the subject such as Raimi's Army of Darkness and other campy titles. It certainly stands well above a large portion of the poor quality and disjointed attempts at the Lovecraft interpretation put out by low-budget film-makers in the last few years. For a purer approach, I woul d recommend The Call of Cthulhu, produced as a classic silent film by the H P Lovecraft Historal Society and other such quality features as Cool Air."
4,"If Ever A Movie Could Be Called ""Unique,"" This Is It!","I wonder why this isn't a movie that people know? After all, it is definitely unique and fun to watch, and how many films do you know that are a combination 1940s film noir and horror? Man, this is a real ""curiosity piece.""It's Los Angeles and 1948 and everyone, except the hero (Fred Ward) is using magic, occult witchcraft-type stuff (which this reviewer hardly endorses). Ludicrous, yes, but fascinating and funny in parts.Too bad this isn't out on DVD because the colors and atmosphere just ooze 1940s. It's also simply great entertainment. Juliane Moore looks gorgeous and Ward is likable in the lead role. He has the authentic look of a private eye, and I like the idea that he has more morals than all the other characters in the movie combined.If any story can be called truly ""unique,"" this is one of them."
5,Organization,This kit is exactly what I needed. Now I do not need to go to several places to get what I need. It is all right at my fingertips.
1,Decorating Kit,This is the perfect gift for someone who likes to be creative and make cakes with bling! It will be put to good use!
2,Disappointing,Compared to the past releases this is the most repetitive and there is no creative 'breakout' in any of the songs. Once the song starts.......this is what you get throughout the song. No big tempo changes that Cretu was famous for in the past. Previous songs would stop on a dime in some cases and move into a completely different direction that were literally awe inspiring. None of that here.Enigma has become no different than any of your other run of the mill trance artists. It's the Enigma sound but compositionally it is boring. This may be a good 'dance' album but that's it. Not inspirational at all.
3,Nice to chill out with,"I am an Enigma-holic who owns all the albums and love them all. As a musician myself I'm always searching for the ultimate unique musical experience and ""A Posteriori"" is awesome. As a whole the ambient spacey grooves here tend to be more similar from track to track and never change much dynamically or tempo wise - they tend to put the listener into a hypnotic trance and that is a good thing when you want that type of feeling.Check outBreathe"
2,Time to move on,"One reviewer has nailed my sentiments to a ""T"". I no longer look forward to Enigma releases. What I have will do me fine. I may break this out once in awhile, but I'm guessing that it will more than likely collect dust. There's a lot of exciting music out there and it's time to move on.For example something I found refreshing along the lines of Enigma is the music coming out of Cirque du Soleil. Try the remix album of ""Tapis Rouge Solarium""."
2,Not Very Scary,"I bought this initially because anything that has ""zombie"" in the title is something I am interested in seeing, especially around Halloween! ""Plague of the Zombies"" was sleep-inducing, the only time I saw a zombie was towards the end of the movie and by then, I could care less! ""The Mummy's Shroud"" spent more time telling the viewer the background of the Egyptian king who became the Mummy then it did in being scary! Both Hammer films in one set but unless you are a Hammer horror fan, I would skip this one entirely. Thankfuly I didn't pay much for it!"
4,a good book,good book good songs i would like to get more song book just like this one and get a good sell on it
4,"Royal Sovereign Sort 'N Save Manual Coin Sorter, Clear (MS-1)","Royal Sovereign Sort 'N Save Manual Coin Sorter, Clear (MS-1)It works very well and sorts accurately. Very sturdy construction"
5,Works Great!,"My husband bought this to sort and roll coins we had been saving for a few years. It worked great! It only took him 2 or 3 days (only for maybe 45 min a day) to sort through over $300. We don't run a business or anything, but it worked great for what we needed it for."
3,COIN SORTER,"wORKS BETTER THAN HAND SORTING BUT UNABLE TO ACCURATLY KNOW HOW MANY COINS ARE IN EACH STACK , ONE TOO MANY OR ONE SHORT ."
1,does not perform,"I bought this unit based on other reviews and of course cost. Found the unit easy enough to operate but the unit jams easily and is sometimes difficult to unjam. if by chance you have a foreign coin in the mix it really becomes difficult. the wrappers i think are best if they are the stiff ones which are sold with the unit i found it very difficult to use the ones you get from the bank.there is alwasy the question as to how full is full when it comes to filling the tubes, very easy to put in one too many or one too less which creates a tendency to want to manual count the coins. I had high hopes but had to return the unit. (which was painless with amazon) thanks"
3,"Not accurate; otherwise, great.","Like some of the other reviewers, I also am finding that the MS-1 does not accurately total the coins, i.e. the number in the tubes is +/- a coin versus the correct amount. I'm not sure if this is a problem with all of the tubes or a manufacturing error with only a portion of them; however, I notice that my machine is consistent in its inaccuracy, so it will always be over or under the same amount of coins for each tube. If it doesn't bother you to manually add or remove a coin from each roll, then this won't be a problem but personally I prefer that the product work as described. Otherwise, it's easy to use and doesn't need batteries, which is nice."
4,very high quality,"This is an awesome chair. The only thing I don't like about it is the limited seat height adjustment capabilities. If your a real tall guy, you might feel this is too short. EXTREMELY comfortable."
4,An excellent primer for the Civil War novice,"As a Canadian, I have very little knowledge of American history in general and the Civil War in particular. This book walked me through the war in great detail and provides an excellent base for future studies."
4,Good but a big quantity,I love this sauce but unfortunately i did not get too much use out if it because I only used it for myself so it went bad before i could finish it.
2,THE HAUNTING OF MOLLY HARTLEY,"JUST ANOTHER MOVIE NOTHING TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED, AND TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE END.."
1,One because i cant give it zero,"This movie is misleading.on the back it says rosemarys baby is grown up but the films have nothing in common.rosemarys baby was at least interesting even in the slow parts this movie is just horrible from start to end.NO thrills or chills,no creepy elemnts what so ever,no kills,and worst of all no acual haunting,i mean what were they thinking when they made this crap?DONT make the mistake i did by watching the movie,its an hour and a half youll NEVER get abck in your life.stay way...far far away."
1,"I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M A PATRIOT!","This is the story of 2 veterans returning from the war in 2007. Adrienne deals with her stress by being a shut-in and taking pills. William is still fighting the war, killing anyone who appears to be a terrorist or anti-American. This is a low budget slasher using post traumatic stress syndrome as the motivator for killing. The movie makes statements about the government's lack of care for veterans, but the acting and dialouge in this film was so bad, I felt it made a mockery of veterans. Terrible script as the killing goes from one disconnected scene to the next. Plenty of fake blood and f-bombs. No sex, no nudity. Giving this 75 minute movie anything more than 1 star would be un-American. Written, directed, and produced by Andrew Copp"
3,its adorable,I wish this was a bit bigger it's soooo tiny but I still love it. very hard items to find.
5,This book is AMAZING!!,"This book is incredible...I recommend it to everyone who wants to get more out of any relationship. I realized that I had been living my life in a bubble before this book, and was giving love to get more love, when what men wanted was respect!! It is incredible how changing a few words in my language patterns with men fulfills their biggest need for respect that is at their innermost core. I am so glad to have this information...I wish I had access to it years ago!! THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!!"
3,Very Repetitive,"Love and Respect deals with the two areas a husband and wife need from one another: Wives need to feel loved and husbands need to feel respected.Love & Respect deals with the two areas a husband and wife need from one another: Wives need to feel loved and husbands need to feel respected.While the author seems to be very knowledgable about the content of which he's writing, I found each section of the book to be very repetitive.How many times do we need to read that a husband should love his wife unconditionally and a wife should respect her husband unconditionally?I understand the need to go through each scenario, and the first-hand testimonies were a nice addition; and I understand this is based on their Love & Respect Conferences so the book reads as if you're attending one.But once you understand his point: Love & Respect, you're good to go. Hopefully you'd be smart enough to figure the rest out on your own.Maybe not...maybe that's why this book has done so well."
4,"blessing,","my teacher recommende this book for us. i didn""t finish yet the reading , but so far i been very blessed. understand more what men needs to feel respect, and how i can do better that he can feel respected.melanie."
4,"Very helpful for self, family, counselees",I have read this book before and ordered it for someone who is considering remarrying. I agree with 85-90% of the ideas presented. Excellent for own use and to share with others. Helps someone know what marriage is about and how to develop great relationships.
5,Love and Respect,I recommend this book to any married couple or anyone planning on getting married. It is a real eye opener as to what women and men need from each other and how to communicate. It would be great for couples to read it together but it even helps if just one reads it and applies it to the marriage.
3,Eh .. okay.,"Halfway though this book, I lost interest because I got bored with hearing the same message over and over again and gave up on it. It seemed repetitive and redundant to me. Perhaps it gets better later on; I may go back and try to finish it, but I found ""How To Save Your Marriage Before It Starts"" by the Parrott's MUCH BETTER and it included the common theme of Love & Respect without beating me over the head."
3,"good if your personal ""issues"" arent too big","I guess mine are, so.... it felt like an expanded brochure. That must mean I need the entire weekend conference."
5,Great book,"The Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires, The Respect He Desperately Needs book I would recommend for all couples if there having problems or not.It was a great price & shipping time"
4,Be revolutionized,"I read a lot of books on marriage over our 34 years - a personal study of mine (as it should be anyone's who wants to enjoy the most delicious fruits of it) - but Dr. Eggerichs' LOVE and RESPECT, is by far the most helpful and revealing in my library. It is never too early in your marriage to be enlightened by this book and never too late. ANY husband and wife, any man or woman, at ANY stage or state of matrimony will be revolutionized by it. Life together will make a lot more sense."
1,Love and Selfishness,"This book is part of the ""give to get"" mentality that is so prevalent in our culture and unfortunately also now in the church. It is also incredibly sexist. Long, happy marriages require both love and respect for both partners. Over the long haul our marriages should reflect mutuality, not selfishness."
5,Death of the Vicious Circle,"A must read for long marrieds and for anyone seeking to prevent those useless, maddening repetitive arguments. This book is for both sides of the couple. The first 4 chapters lay out the logical criteria so don't take it as bashing men or women. It states what turns out to be the obvious. It is well worth the effort. After 39 years, we are in honeymoon heaven again."
5,Truely a blessing,"My couples Bible Study Group read this book and watched his videos. We were all amazed at how true and how powerful the message is. Such a simple concept, yet so life changing. I've given away several copies of this book to friends and family, who feel their marriage is over. Buy this book, better than counseling."
4,Super helpful,"This book was so helpful. There are many underlying religious tones, and I am not a religious person, but the content far outweighs any religious judgement people may feel. Some of the examples of couples issues and arguments are almost verbatim what my boyfriend and I have gone through. It really gives a good insight of the other person's thoughts and actions/reactions. Highly recommend for couples feeling like they can't talk to each other anymore."
5,Women won't like this book,"This book presents a well balanced view of the marriage relationship. There are many books on how to love your wife but this is the first I know of on how to respect your husband as well as how to love your wife. How many people that travel in Christian circles have ever heard women say ""I'll respect him as long as he loves God"" or something similar to it.This book addresses the fact that your obedience to Scripture shouldn't be based on how the other spouse is behaving. It gives you advice for dealing with a difficult spouse who's not being loving or respectful. It tells what their fears may be that are hindering them from giving love and/or respect. The ""Crazy Cycle"" section is eye opening.In this book it shows that men can easily be the victims in bad marriages. This book is revolutionary for it's time and won't be received well by many women."
3,Love and Respect for a Lifetime,"I read the book ""Love and Respect for a Lifetime"" by Dr. Emerson EggerichsThe book eloquently states that ""Women absolutely need love and Men absolutely need respect"".It also points out...""Oh that couples would discover the power of Love and Respect. Love and Respect are like oxygen to a suffocating person and this is one reason why God commands a husband to love and a wife to respect"".I totally agree with the above but I would also like to add that wives need respect and husbands need love also. Its a give/give, 2 way street. I think this would be an excellent gift book for newly married couples, for couples about to marry and for couples that are struggling in their marriage. For couples with a great marriage, I think this would be a little repetitive.James 1:19""So then my beloved brethren, let everyman be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath."""
4,a classic!,"This movie still lives on in my 31 yr old mind today, as I still reply ""chicken butt"" whenever someone asks me ""guess what?"" I was so excited to finally find this movie to purchase. It takes me back to those days of going to shows after begging for change to get in and the music is awesome. This movie, along with repo man were and I suppose still are must sees for all the punk rockers out there! OI!"
5,suburbia,its way better than slc punk... if want realism then watch this movie..it also has a kickass soundtrack. flea was REALLY young when he did this flick.. i reccomend it..now watch it and burn down hot topic..
4,WHY ISN'T THIS AVAILABLE ON DVD?!,"When will this original Hammer Fu Manchu and the equally good Brides of Fu Manchu be made available for American distribution? The ones available now are inferior sequels but these were great Hammer entries. I would even settle for a box set of all the Hammer Fu Manchu with the great early ones and the lesser latter ones. I WROTE THIS YEARS AGO AND IS IT IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD. MOST OTHER HAMMER'S INCLUDING INFERIOR ONES ARE. WHY NOT ""FACE OF FU MANCHU""--THE BEGINNING AND BEST OF THE LOT."
4,Great for entertaining,"Great for entertaining / cocktails / dinner party, but a little repetitive for just listening to music alone. Stylish and sexy."
1,"I would give it negative stars, if I could. It was awful.",It should get negative stars. Do not waste your time or money on this thing. It shouldn't even be called a movie. I have no idea how they got some famous actors in this. They must have been drugged.
5,I love this CD,"Alice Deejay is great. I was able to find a old tape of it. The songs are great. My favorite ones are Back in my Life, Better off Alone and Will I Ever. Too bad they never made anymore CDs. It does not cost much on Amazon so order a copy today."
3,whatever,"Alice deejay is good in the beats and tunes that she prodices. She shouldn't start singing in her music(sorry). Her voice is really out of tune and this really distroys the music. Whiles listening to some of her songs, i found that her singing didn't go with the beat and she was out of key. I have heard lot of better voices in dance music. This is a truly dance album thought. She really hits the dance spot , the beat is really dancy and that is pretty good. I would don't really think it is a great cd to stick with so Alice come out with a new cd without any of that out of tune singing please!"
2,why so few people like trance,"if you are looking for astoundingly predictable, offensively bubbly Dutch trance pop, you need look no further! on the other hand if you are looking for decent trance you should probably keep looking. if i was at a trendy club and i'm dancing away and the DJ decides to include ""better off alone"" or ""back in my life"" in his set (it happens quite a lot actually), i honestly think the optimistic chord progressions of those songs can round out the evening quite well. but an entire album full of songs like this, many of which actually sound like the same song, is more than i can stomach. if you're considering buying this because you want some trance and you don't know what to buy, go get Tranceport (Paul Oakenfold). it's somewhat cheezy too, but it's a really good mix of songs."
1,The Most OverRated Album Ever,This album is poorly done by this DJ. I Don't Know what she was thinking of doing this album. This is an Over Over Rated album i hated and alot of Euro people do also. Only American Dance fan's like this She is way back to compete against Artist Like Robert Miles and Paul Van Dyk or Ayla. Those are 3 great artist's so im telling you people don't buy this album!!
3,"Great music, horrible singing","Although Alice Deejay obviously has a lot of musical talent when it comes to the synthesizers, her voice is weak, nasal, and incredibly grating, and ruins what would otherwise be an album full of really great songs. Fortunately, there are 2 instrumental tracks, and one track where she uses a vocoder to mask her awful voice, but all the other tracks make me wish she'd enlisted someone else to sing. I'm sure that there's some sort of music out there for which her voice would be perfect, but it's definitely not anthem-y techno, and she comes off sounding like Fran Drescher trying to belt out Haddaway's ""What is Love"". (OK, it's not quite THAT bad, but it's too close for MY comfort.)"
2,here we go again.....,"Well, let's see.... you put vocals on newer style electronic beats, repeat, and then repeat again and you have a CD that will sell. This CD lacks soul and is nothing more than ready for radio tech songs. Although ""Better off Alone"" is a catchy song and not a bad one at that, it will soon see it's way out the door ""Blue (da ba dee)"" style. There is so much better techno-electronic out there if you just look beyond radio play......"
5,Musical Caffeine,"I always listen to this CD when I get ready for work. Just play a couple of tracks in the shower, or while getting ready and not only will you be in a good mood but you'll be pumped. If you like dance music, and want something good to listen to, but this cd. It's pretty good, and if you like ""Better off Alone"" you will definetly like the rest. Enjoy!"
2,We never used it,I bought it after reading the review. I guess it's not comfortable since I never use it.
4,"Excellent price, ok quality.","I got this phone for a great price (about 11 bucks after a gift certificate). So I'm not complaining about that, but the microphone extension is a bit too short, and the earbud part is hard to put on my ear, but other than that it's a great product."
4,Good for this Price,"Reading the ads and other persons' reveiws, I expected it to be smaller and lighter. It is actually a little bit too big for my ear (since I am a small person), it fell down sometimes (I have to avoid sudden movement). I think it would be ok for an average (size) person. However, the design is nice. I wish it will come in white color so it will match my AT&T phone.It can be used with many device with 2.5 mm. plug such as cellular phone, computer, also works on my Motorola Fr50 two-way radio.Sound is clear and loud, it's a little amplifier, I have to dial the phone before putting it on because the dial tones of the phone through this head set is so loud, it hurts my ear. It hurts even more after a long time talking because of its weight hanging on my ear. The material (plastic) is quite hard and sturdy.In conclusion, it works, it's inexpensive, multiple devices compatible. However person who look for a very comfortable head set may not like this one."
3,good but not great,Very lightweight I can hardly tell it is there. Sound quality is not as good as I had hoped for based on other reviews. Also the people that I call indicate they have a hard time hearing me when using the headset. I'm considering returning it in favor of a boom-style mic.
3,nice watch,"This was a very nice watch, but unfortunately I have a small wrist and it was too big and I had to return it. Great, easy return process! Thank you!"
2,"""Eh""","The title read Novo! Mais! Melhor! and had David Byrne's name on it. But it was anything but the title. Actually I thought this was downright dull. There are loads of compilations with much more flair-- like Nova Bossa for old, Cuca Nova/Red Hot+ Rio for new renditions. Great artists like Mercury, Monte and Veloso are wasted on this-- they're why the CD has two stars instead of one. The only song I enjoyed was ""What is This"", but I would suggest buying Sergio Mendes' Brasileiro instead of this one. Disappointing CD.. save your money"
3,"""Some"" great cuts","This is a fair album if we compare it to the first one. David leaves outside many great singers/groups like Daude, Suzano, even the great Ed Motta; and on the other hand, some cuts are not worth listing in a ""Beleza"" (Beauty)album. Anyhow, Gilberto Gil's cut is excellent among two or three more. I stick with the first one."
3,Great Music,The music is great but the sound quality seems off. It starts off so quiet you have to turn your stereo up to hear and then once it gets going you have to turn it down.
4,sounds unheard,The music and words capture an emotional timewhen abominable torture was visited on Jewsin unspeakable experiences. The soaringsounds and word make listening to thispiece both a difficult emotional experienceand spiritual climax.
5,Humanity At Its Best,"In his straightforward way, Gorecki cultivates a seed planted by an anonymous victim of horrors perpetrated by humanity at its worst. His result, the most beautiful and compassionate elegy for innocent sufferers of the 20th Century, cries out to God in a way no other music ever has. Were my soul to be put on a CD, I like to imagine it sounding something like this."
5,Great coffee every time...,"I've had it for a few months. Works great. Coffee is as good if not better as any I've bought at Starbucks or any other. You can REALLY taste the difference in coffees when using this machine. You will no longer buy ANY cheap coffee. Very fast heatup from the ""Energy Saver"" mode. No complaints. Buy it...you'll be glad you did! I bought this $1300.00 machine for $599.00 on Amazon...its a steal if you can get that deal again!"
5,*BEST* controller ever made.,"This has to be the best game controller ever made for the PC.It has plenty of buttons and everything else.Works great with every version of Windows from 95 to XP!Best Feature: Daisy ChainingI currently have 4 of these, and they are all plugged into my single joystick/midi port!I normally use these for EA sports titles, and with 4, I can have 4 people playing at once!If you buy one, you will not regret it!"
1,How do you calibrate it???,"I put this in my computers gameport I have windows 98 and I went to the control panel and it was on the list so I clicked it than it said ""not connected."" I tried going to add new hardware it just didn't work."
5,A struggle between a British lad and a young Chagga man.,"This supernatural struugle is truly gripping and thrilling. Campbell reveals the struggle between the African tribal and British white man's ways through the use of realistic, alternating dialogue and thoughts. The descriptions of Mt. Kilamanjaro make me want to climb it to see for myself its mystical wonders. The two boys, Kimanthi and Alan, move from boyhood best friends to predator-prey. The ending of the story left my heart aching for for both boys and their families. I plan to use this novel in my 11th grade English course called Communications III. This novel is a good example of world literature to teach students about Africa and part of its history. Also, it exemplifies how communication is used and misused by people of different age groups and cultures when they try to express themselves or relate to each other."
5,An appreciated gift,I bought this item (Franklin electronic dictionary) as part of an 8th grade graduation gift for my grandaucghter. She said she liked it and it would come in handy in High School next year.
1,Disappointing,"First time around, the item arrived promptly and in good condition. Worked for ~2 weeks, then the screen went blank. Changing the battery didn't do a thing. Called the seller, who responded quickly and sent a new unit rapidly to me. However, the new unit started malfunctioning within 2 days (pressing any key brought up the screen message ""this key is ineffective"". no improvement with resetting and turning on-off). While one malfunctioning unit may well be an accident, two is harder to understand. I'm getting my money back this time!"
2,difficult to read,The combination the screen and the font color makes the dictionary very difficult to use. Buy more advanced version to see the word easily.
4,Worth a try,"I found the book to be very well written and it was very moving. I have to admit, however, that the reading was quite difficult, perhaps because I come from a Western background and Rushdie wrote it from an Indoeuropean one."
2,Hmmmm...,"After all of the publicity surrounding this novel, I found the content disappointingly non-stimulating. The character descriptions were good, but strange, and the plot was difficult and frustrating to follow. I would not read this book a second time."
4,excellent...though tough to comprehend,i recently managed to get my hands on this masterpiece of the millenium.(though...this is banned in india.despite being an indian and my knowledge of islam and stuff...the book is still quite tough to comprehend (had to read parts of it 3-4 time to make sense).Rushdie demonstrates great skill and maturity in depicting various scenes in this magnum opus as it reveals....
5,Mind Blowing,"It's complex, so elaborate, yet, within the complexity lies so simple, so easy to understand, the good vs. evil battle. Our inner demons, everything. This a great book. Read it, go beyond everything you've heard about Rushdie, forget all the controversy revolving around the book, simply read it , and see what I mean."
2,satanic verses,I'm having trouble sticking with it. It's a little nebulous and I enjoy more concrete of a style. I'm still not sure what got him into so much trouble but it does speak to the attitude of Islamic people Catholics have been ridiculed and seem to take it better
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read ...,... and I've read a lot of books. I've said more in a 40 word article than anything written in one paragraph of this book. The hype about the author writing the book and his being on the receiving end of a personal jihad make a better plot and captivate my interest more than the plotline of this book. My deepest regret is that I couldn't rate this book with negative stars.
3,I don't get it!,"I bought 'The Satanic Verses' to see what all the hullabaloo was about. Rushdie had threats on his life over this? Unbelievable!Had Rushdie not insulted the Islamic faith, I can't conceive that the book would have received such notice. In fact, I didn't get far enough into it to follow the plot, and I couldn't get interested enough in the tale to locate the insults which so infuriated the Arab muslims.It reads like a fantasy, which I suppose it was intended to be. For those inclined to this sort of writing, I assume it is considered great. For those of us used to more mundane writing and more straightforward plots, I think this is a pass.I wish Salman Rushdie the best, but I'm afraid he cannot count me as one of his fans. (I appreciate the fact that he has the courage to insult the towel-heads, however.)Salaam!Joseph (Joe) Pierre,Author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
3,Either Im bad at English or this book is not written in English,I have read many other books (in English) but Salman Rushdie's English is beyond me!
1,Writing style,"I was really excited about this book after reading all the great reviews both on amazon and in the paper. However, I couldn't get past the first chapter without great annoyance. The lyrical writing style the author uses apparently resonates with some readers, but I felt it was too sing-song and that his style got in the way of the story. If I could return the book, I would."
2,Get Killed,This is a pretty interesting book on the way of fighting that was taught during world war two and up til the 80's or 90's. As far as an effective fighting system...I dont see how this system was effective in making soldiers from the OSS to the First Special Service Force effective killers. Seems to me that if you practiced this every day youd still get your ass handed to you. Good read but some of the things used here is more like girly fighting. The thumb locks and all seem pretty cheesy. I cant believe this was used to teach the military how to kill. Its a joke of a system if you ask me. Just like U.S. army combatives its a joke and it sucks compared to Eskrima...a REAL and EFFECTIVE and PROVEN fighting system.
4,"Great book, but could use an update","The only reason this does not rate 5 stars is that the technical information is 50 years old. I would love for him to undate the section on handguns, especially since we've advanced several levels since this was written. Otherwise, I think it can replace several other books on the subject on self-defence and shooting. It should be a required reading for anyone interested in armed or unarmed self-defence."
5,Excellent,"I watched this gem of a film by accident, then watched it three more times. I can't get it out of my thoughts now. I was scrolling for a film to watch and what caught my attention was the fact that the three young girls that portray the Aboriginal half-casts had no acting experience and very little coaching. I was amazed that while straining to read the lines regarding the outcome at the end of the film, I had tears in my eyes. And the second time, and the third ...I am somewhat ashamed to say that I had no idea of this chapter in Australian history. The parallels to American ""Indian Schools"" make this film a must-see for everyone."
3,Rabbit Proof Fence,"A movie about three Aborigines girls. They were tookin by a messed up government. And were put in a bording school. The three Aborigine girls scaped from the bording school. And walked 1500 miles across the desert following the longest rabbit proof fence in Australia just to go home. The Aborigine tracker tracks down the three girls.This movie is great. It is exiting. Its not really my kind of movie but it made me think a lot of what the Aborigines went through. If you come across this movie at least watch it before you judge it.I am a young viewer and I didn't think I would like it. But after I saw the movie there was lots of things I like and some things I disliked. But mostly, I liked the movie."
4,Amazing story.,"While I would like to say I loved this move, I must say it broke my heart. The story must be told, the directing fantastic, and the stars will steal your heart."
5,rabbit proof fence,"Wow... incredible movie with gut wrenching scenes. The acting is top rate... the movie is based on real life situations... it's hard to watch, at times, but this is life and one is not always exposed to the best things. A movie that you never forget."
3,Story of a Stolen Generation,"Heartbreaking and outrageously offensive, Rabbit Proof Fence is most brilliant in how it maneuvers the audience to the same eye level as Australia's ""Stolen Generation."""
5,Great remote!,"Our toddler killed our original remote and since we have all Sony items (DVD, VCR and TV), we decided to get a Sony remote too. The best part is that we didn't have to program a thing! It immediately recognized all of our Sony electronics. It's also nice that we didn't lose all of the features of our original remote. It is very easy to use. I halfway think we should get another one to have as a backup just in case."
5,Great Value,I received the replacement tv remote controls sooner than expected. Brand new in original packaging. Great value.
3,Not what I expected,"Unlikeable, neurotic unpleasant people; couldn't get into it and really didn't care what happened to any of them. First (and last) I have read from this author, Expected a good boarding school story and an interesting mystery, Oh well......"
3,OK calculator that sorely needs an update,"I was surprised at how OLD this thing is - the manual is from the early eighties, and that's the kind of technology you get. For example, it has the ACRS table (depreciation for tax purposes) in it's memory, yet that was replaced years ago by Modified ACRS (or MACRS), so that calculator's function is obsolete and therefore useless. I did just as well, even better, with a ""cheap"" yet functional TI BA-35 Solar for things like quick TVM calculations. And if you're going to spend over $100 on a calculator, why not buy a decent graphing calculator? Things like histograms with this 19BII are a total joke compared to them. I really wish that HP would make a 19BIII model. They could give this thing some REAL statistical graphing capability, make a higher resolution graphing display, update the functions, give it an algebraic entry option, replace the ACRS with MACRS, etc. Until then, I'll be using my graphing calculator."
2,"GREAT MACHINE, BUT BAD BATTERY COMPARTMENT DESIGN","I had the HP 12C for many years, and when they introduced the HP 19B ii Business Consultant, I bought it. Great machine, and speed, and comfortable to use. However the ONLY drawback is the battery compartment. I think either the battery compartment springs are too strong so that we have to really press the batteries very hard to slip on the battery compartment cover, or the cover design is so bad that it does not ever close properly. I had compalined to HP years ago, but with no result of a replacement. I still use this machine very sparingly, being more comfortable with the HP 12C. So much so that I had bought the 12C a few more times to give as gifts to friends."
2,"Good, but too big, too fragile","I do own one of these but for serious day-by-day calculation at work I prefer the 12C, it is much more easy to use and much more robust."
3,Poorly Scripted But Still Engaging,Dirty Pretty Things is a reasonably good thriller set in the rather depressing world of immigrant workers in London. The film is part horror story as a hotel clerk from Nigeria discovers that the hotel is being used for an illegal human organ scheme. Chiwetel Ehiiofor is very strong in the lead role and Audrey Tautou does well as a Turkish immigrant who is struggling to survive and escape London for New York. Where the movie bogged down a bit for me is in some of the moralizing dialogue gets to be a bit too contrived and not true to character. Other than that flaw the film is unusual in it's subject matter and interesting on a number of levels. It certainly demonstrates the cruel and mercenary nature of people who are ready to exploit the vulnerable among us.
4,Dirty Pretty Things...,"This movie was better than I thought it would be, and the acting was very good! Audrey Tautou makes the most of her role...four stars!"
2,Did I see the same movie or what????,"Okay I just saw this movie the other night and all I can say is, ""Is this the same movie you guys saw?"" This movie was mediocre at BEST. The plot 'twist' was predictable and the movie really had very little to offer other than a decent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't really approach horrible, but it certainly wasn't stellar."
4,Dirty Pretty Things makes the world smaller,"Dirty Pretty Things is a great movie, with a strong message about how small the world is and makes one think twice about their purchases. Did someone have to endure working in a sweatshop to make my clothes? It opened my eyes about the world around me and through this movie the invisible (workers, and silent ideology) become visible and audible."
3,Dirty Pretty Things,It was hard to hear and disjointed about the plot.Audrey was wasted in a dumb plot!Dirty Pretty Things should have Dumb Things!
2,A dissapointment...,"This game had potential...before I beat it after about 9 hours. Extremely short game, with very little replay value makes for a dissapointing game! Every mission seems the same...Chase a villian through New York for about 15 min., then if you kept up you'll end up fighting the villian. Playing as Venom was cool, but his missions were more or less the same as Spidey's. Chase, keep up, boss battle, thats all the game was about. Gets old real fast! This game is barely worth 10 bucks! The Limited Edition didn't really have anything extra worth mentioning. When are they going to make a Spider-Man game that is more like GTA? I need more free roaming fun!"
2,A hold up that lets down,"I bought this product because I was looking for the product I was useing and could no longer find. I was let down. When I applied it to my damp hair it made it stiff like straw. It was hard to pull a comb through it without breaking my hair. After I rolled and dried it, It did look good and it held the curls but it is not worth the hair pulling for me."
2,2 year old not impressed.,My son has not played with this toy twice. I guess he is too old to be entertained by the circulating gears. Maybe a younger child would like it better.
1,Never buy another schwinn!,"We have a C130 upright less than 3 years old. The resistence died. Called their customer service and they'll send someone out for over a hundred bucks to look at it, order the part and then charge us another $75 to come back and install it. After a lot of research -- the schwinn site is useless for support info -- found an aftermarket parts and repair site and it looks like the unit we'd need to fix this is >$400! Can you say R-I-P-O-F-F ?"
4,Girls Night in,"Grab your girlfriends and get ready to sing! If you like ABBA and can look beyond the totally contrived plot of the movie, you will have a blast singing along in this totally feel-good movie about friendship, mother/daughter relationships, dreams, and love. I promise the songs will stay in your head for DAYS! The scenery is gorgeous and the movie is fun. Enjoy!"
1,Embarrassing,"This may be one of the worst films I've ever seen -- even just for fun, it's just plain embarrassing! If you like/love ABBA's music (which I do), get their CDs. If you like/love all these truly wonderful actors (I do!), watch them in something else!!! I just hope they were paid well and had a ball on location. There is no plot, no script, and no, Pierce Brosnan, fine man and fine actor that he is, can't carry a tune in a ten-barrel bucket. I just kept waiting for this to be OVER! Glad I checked it out of the library instead of paying anything to see it. The best thing about it is the end titles. Don't waste your time -- if you're looking for fluff, for fun, there are many other movies worth the time!"
1,Terrible Movie,I love movie musicals. This is one of the worst movies (of any kind) I have ever seen. Watching and listening to Pierce Brosnan in this movie is painful. Rent before you waste your money on this one.
1,Ho-Hum,"I love ABBA. I love Meryl Streep. I love music. I love my best friend who recommended this movie to me.How will I ever tell my best friend the truth, after having ordered and watched this pitiful production.All the way through,I couldn't wait for it to be over. I have rarely ""ever"" felt this way about a film.Don't waste your money. It is a travesty. Nothing redeemable. Beyond stupid and boring. Very sad to say.ZzZzZz"
3,Musical Meryl,"After being unceremoniously passed over for the film version of ""Evita,"" the incomparable Meryl Streep finally showcases her singing and dancing talents in ""Mamma Mia!"" Her sparkling presence makes this lightweight confection more pleasurable than it has any right to be. Forget the threadbare plot - not to mention Pierce Brosnan's painful vocal stylings - and enjoy the rare sight of Meryl belting out the ABBA songbook."
2,Mamma Mia,"Very poor show! An adaptation of a stage play that had very poor scenery,plot,idiotic characters and poor choreography. A real dud."
3,Mama Mia the movie,I was thinking it would be better but i still enjoyed it. Meryl is fantastic. I love the way the ABBA songs were used. But my best ABBA movie is still MURIEL'S WEDDING.
4,Great feel good movie,The music was fun and the cast was incredible. Have watched it several times and always go away with a warm feeling.
2,Casting ruins the movie and the music,"I was a huge ABBA fan as a teenager. I have all their music and still enjoy listening to them. I even liked the stage play Mamma Mia.However...the movie stinks! First of all, why on earth did the filmmakers cast actors who cannot sing? And if they had to cast these actors, at least let them lip sync. I adore Meryl Streep but she is not that talented when it comes to singing. Pierce Brosnan is so atrocious that I had to fast-forward his numbers. Ditto for everyone else in this movie (well Christine Baranski is not too bad). I don't see how anyone could appreciate Abba's music after hearing it here.The only thing I did enjoy was the cinematography and the incredibly colorful Mediterranean setting."
5,Great Feel Good Musical,"I've been an ABBA fan since the beginning, and loved the cast. I paid to see this movie eight times, and would have gone more if it had stayed in theatres longer! I laughed so hard, I cried, and it gave me such a euphoric feeling. Almost like being in love! The scenery, including those gorgeous actors,was an amazing sight to behold. I can't wait to have my own DVD and watch it every time I want to feel good. I grew up going to Broadway musicals, and this brought back every wonderful feeling I ever had for the genre. Thank you for making my heart sing! Better than therapy! When Julie Walters jumped up on the table to sing, I laughed so hard, I almost fell out of my chair. She was incredible! Mrs Weasley, you go, girl!"
1,Digital Copy a FARCE,"When I received this I attempted to download the digital copy following the provided instructions. The download failed to process and I received a notice that the code provided was invalid. I attempted to contact Universal and received no response. I then emailed amazon and asked for their assistance. I was informed that this was not their problem that it was between me and universal. I did NOT purchase from universal, I purchased it from amazon and it is amazon that did NOT provide me with the entire item that I purchased! FAIL FAIL FAIL!"
4,Mamma Mia!,Excellent movie with good bonus features. Fun to watch!Received very quick delivery by Amazon.
2,Music was the only enjoyable thing,I watched this movie and gave it away. There is no way I could sit through it more than once. The music was the only good thing and sinceI have the ABBA album there was no reason to hang on to the movie.Talk about wrong casting. Pierce Brosnon was not the best choice forthis roll.
1,"Worse than ""Manos: The Hands of Fate""?","I like ABBA music, and I'm in the target demographic, but I cringed continually watching this. There is a scene right before the wedding where Meryl Streep is singing for several minutes about how she doesn't want to talk, while Pierce Brosnan is standing there in what for him must have been an excruciating reaction shot. But I also felt he was thinking: ""This is dreadful. Thank heavens we're filming at a great location and tonight we can get drunk at the taverna in town."" The acting seems forced and phony, and I could not identify with anyone in the movie. The idea that a young woman would somehow think it romantic (which is what the bride-to-be expresses in her opening song) that her mother had sex with three different men in succession strains credulity. The giggling didn't help. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch."
2,Absolutely Unacceptable piece of manure.,"The reason that I have such a firm dislike to this particular DVD is that I am an ABBA fan. I have every vinyl...first cut vinyl...that they have ever done. I have ticket stubs, plane ticket receipt, and hotel receipts for ever tour that they have done.I am not a purist. The contrivance of this particular use of their material is pretty good on the stage. They just did not translate the material well. Whether it was the London Stage, New York Stage or the ABBA road show, they had better voice and acting talents.I saw this dog (I apologize for insulting any dog. It is just that the appelation works in general.) via Netflix. It is a good tool to weed out movies like this. Stick with the DVD/CD's of any other stage performance. Save your money until the dog becomes so cheap as to maybe rate having it as an addition to the collection."
1,The End of Civilization as We Knew It.,"Two hours of Streep screeching across the Aegean. Atonal, flat-footed and stomach-churning debacle unworthy of the description ""musical"". Yet look at all the 4-star reviews and the world-wide box-office success. The rest of us might as well slit our wrists now - it's not just movies that have grown proudly and irreversibly shallow, but moviegoers as well."
2,totally implausible scenario,"Let's face it: The very idea that not just one, but all three of the invited men, would just simply drop their families, their jobs, and other commitments in their very busy lives, and all three of them invest substantial time and money to fly across the Atlantic to Greece (assuming they could even acquire passports in time) is ridiculous and implausible. For such a scenario to fall in place would never happen in a million years."
3,"Lighthearted, Enjoyable, and Actors Really Having Fun","First, let me preface this by saying that I enjoy Abba's music. This is basically a group of Abba songs loosely tied together with a charming storyline. Despite its relatively weak storyline, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't remember the last time I saw a movie where the actors seemed to really enjoy themselves. Kudos to the established actors for singing their songs (vs. lip synching) - particularly gorgeous Pierce Brosnan, who doesn't have the most lyrical of voices. That takes courage. By the same token, I was impressed by the musical voices of Meryl Streep and Colin Firth. The vocal talents of young Amanda Siegfried are impressive. Of course scenes of the beautiful Adriatic just add to the enjoyment, as does seeing the always handsome Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in the same film. So, if you want an uncomplicated movie that just leaves you feeling good - maybe singing a few Abba songs - rent this movie."
5,Fun fun fun!,"I can't help but love this movie. Great cast and lots of fun! very funny, too! Songs that most people already know."
3,Fair,"Its a musical, the place is beatifull but story is too soft, is not a movie you want to see many times"
1,Thank Goodnes I rented instead of bought this movie.,After renting this movie and watching for about 30 minutes I gave up any hope that it would get to be anything but silly (stupid) with poor music and story. I am amazed at what people can be entertained by.
5,The winner takes it all!!!,"This is an amazing movie. I grew up with ABBA, and I'm a huge fan. I've seen the play twice, so I knew what to expect, but this movie exceeded my expectations!!! It is so tastefully done, and the actors are all wonderful. Whether you've seen it or not, BUY IT!! You will watch it over and over."
2,"Loved the stage show, the movie was barely okay","My wife and I had seen the stage show twice. As I think about it, she may have seen it a third time with friends. We really enjoyed it every time. The movie was not half as much fun. Pierce Brosnan was a terrible casting choice. He can't sing at all. The actor playing Bill was not really all that good either. Finally Meryl Streep overpowered her role. It was supposed to be light and fun but she brought way too much depth to the role. Way to weighty. This was supposed to be light and fun folks."
5,Loved the music and locations,it was so fun and the actors in it did a great job. could not help but pat your foot
1,you can only call it a musical if the actors can sing,First off I really love musicals and ABBA music. This musical is really bad. The only one who can sing is the girl who plays the daughter. Everyone else just looks uncomfortable to be there - especially Brosnan. The acting is terrible...very campy. I was actually embarrassed for the actors/actresses while I watched it. It was like they realized part way through filming that since no one could act or sing they should make it as cheesy as possible. I would rent this instead of buying it if you feel you have to see it.....buying it is just a waste of money. It's a just ghastly train wreck!
4,This movie made me laugh out loud on a plane.,I was a little embarrassed by that. But not so embarrassed that it stopped me from doing it again...
5,Outstanding Movie,"If you enjoyed ABBA, you should enjoy this movie. While the actors are not professional singers, they are professional actors and their efforts are heart felt and ring true. Can't say enough about Meryl. She showed another deminsion and rose to a new level of acting."
5,It worked for me!,"Mama Mia is the big-screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. Sophie lives on a remote Greek island with her ex-rock star mother Donna (Meryl Streep, who, you may know, can nail a song). Sophie is about to marry Sky and she really wants her dad to give her away. Unfortunately, Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Finding her mother's diary, she invites the three men Donna was involved with at the time: Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry (Colin Firth). Mostly the film is a showcase for singing and dancing to the best of ABBA's songs. It got a lot of critical reviews, but it definitely worked for me. A lot of fun."
5,Mamma Mia Superb!,"Mamma Mia in Blu-ray is breath-taking, scenery is great, sound is second to none. ABBA music is timeless. Pierce Brosnan is a great actor, but should not consider a career in singing. All-in-All this is a wonderful musical"
3,It's not so much the bad singing but stupid plot,"Okay, let me be honest. I had heard about this film/musical for a long time. I thought I'd give it a shot because I like ABBA songs and a good musical. Sadly this film had a stupid plot meant to try and fit in the various ABBA songs they wanted to feature.I won't comment on the singing which ranges from wonderful to terrible. Bravo for trying and you will also be surprised at who can sing in this film.I found myself saying, 'Who cares?' most of the movie. I watched it on dvd and fast forwarded most of the second half.The best songs were at the end of the movie in the wrap up scenes. What were they thinking? Put them in the movie, not at the end when people are walking out.I think I was just confused at the muddled plot. Very stupid, stupid idea for a movie."
4,"An adorable, fun, and feel-good movie!","This movie WAS a bit corny, but it's also very sweet. It makes you want to get up, dance, and sing along! I love the sing-a-long part of the DVD..VERY FUN!"
2,A Song Every Five Minutes....,"There are apparently two types of musicals...ones where there is a solid story and the actors sing a song every now and then...and ones where there is like only five minutes of dialogue before the next song began. This movie is in the latter group. I hate musicals like that! I tried to forward through all the songs, but it was obviously a hopeless cause. Not that I don't like ABBA songs, I do! In fact, that's why I stopped watching this movie in the first half hour; I was afraid if I continued, I would end up deleting all of the ABBA songs from my iPod, and smashing all of my ABBA CDs.The funny thing is I was watching this DVD as a break from three other DVDs I have been watching for two weeks--the mini-series ""Holocaust"", which was one of Meryl Streep's first works. I thought it would be nice to see her in a happy movie in a happy place in a happy time. Much to my dismay, I ended up rather seeing her in a Jewish ghetto in WWII Europe!"
5,Sing-along gift,"It was a present for my wife, who PAID to see Mamma Mia! at least four times, so I knew she'd be crazy about it -- and she was (and still is)."
3,Mediocre,"Granted the video is interesting and has some good facts but this is a video, not a book. I wanted to see some action and everything seems to be a good hunt only last for about a second or 2. Twelve fascinating creatures of both India and Africa (24 in total) are to many to cover adequately in one disc. This should have been a 2 disc feature to demonstrate each animals capabilities, hunting abilities or just what makes then so deadly, rather than just narrating it. You mostly just see the animals walking in their natural habitat."
2,Had to use for finance.,I had to buy this calculator for a finance class. I did not like it. The buttons are small and stick at times. But most students are stuck in a hard place since it is required for business classes.
3,"Not bad, but not as good as the first one","It's good ""swing"" music, the the First CJ & LBB album was better, more daring and edgy than this. The worst part about this is that the First album is tragically unavailable. I have it on cassette, but I'd love a CD! Still, LBB II is a pretty good listen. Another problem for me: it's kind of hard to get used to Colin's version of ""Tin Pan Alley"", after having been weaned on Stevie Ray Vaughan's beautifully stark rendition...."
3,RAVE IS OK,The DTS mix is amazing on the disc. I was absolutely floored by the sound quality..The only downside is Prince's so so band..Larry Graham's presence is also visually unappealing..I give this 3 out of 5 stars..
2,"Two boys' review: Good message, but book needs updating","I've reviewed several of the Berenstain Bears books available at Amazon. This one is my least favorite because it is stuck in the mid-1980s. Mother Bear supposes the increased TV viewing is a result of the family switching from a black-and-white TV to a color set or, perhaps, because Papa Bear installed a new antenna atop the tree house.Seriously, in a world of satellite TV, digital video recorders and on-demand movies, do you think upgrading to color television is the issue?The rest of the book, which focuses on outdoor activities and the value of a family dinner time, is still valuable, but could use an update as well.Skip this book and pick up ""The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Commercials"" instead."
4,Good product overall.,"I'm a collage student in Finance major, our professor requires us to use financial calculator so I choose this one based on all the reviews which I thought it would be perfect. Well,it really need some time to get used to it especially when you are familiar with TX 84,it's totally different and require reading all the instruction before you use it."
1,Buttons in the wrong places,"Need I say more? Three of the buttons are in the wrong place. One of them isn't even labeled, I had to look at the website picture to figure this out.Thanks for the outsourcing."
4,HP12C Very Good,"Don't laugh, no kidding, ""reverse Polish notaton"" is the truly intuitive way to do most math in computers, in your mind and in the HP12C. The 25 year old hand held calculator is as new to day as it was 25 years ago."
5,Great Real Estate Calculator,"Once you go 12C..you won't use any other calculator. Simple and easy to use. I have used it daily since 1983 as well as my partners in my commercial real estate firm. It allows me to calculate mortage amounts based on interest rate, time and present values in seconds. Must have if your in real estate or real estate finance."
2,Slow but sure.,"As might be expected from a calculator whose design has apparently remained unchanged over the past two decades, it's easy to use. That's the good news.The bad news is that the processor evidently hasn't been updated in the past two decades either. It takes an astonishing 5 seconds to return the result of a compound interest calculation that the 17BII returns almost instantly.Don't buy this calculator unless you collect museum pieces. It's a dog."
5,Still the best,"I'm a current MBA student and wasted my first year with the BA-II Plus Professional. The buttons were hard to push and, in general, Excel could do everything easier and faster. I decided to try the 12C during my summer internship and quickly became addicted to RPN, as well as to the look and feel of the calculator itself. There's a reason this is still a top seller after 30 years, and it's not just nostalgia. I would recommend for any finance student."
3,"Excellent quality tool, but........................","I already have a few of these multi-tools, several Leatherman, Gerber and the Classic Swiss Army knives etc.But I have yet seen one with an axe and hammer function, so I ordered this.I found it to be of excellent quality and workmanship, but limited in use. Functionally speaking, its not that useful at all.Its too large and too limited in functions when compared to a decent Swiss Army Knives.But its too small and light to be of any use in any chores that requires some chopping and pounding.Its a ""better than nothing"" tool.You can do so much better with a proper camping axe/hammer combo plus a nice little Swiss Army job."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"If you're looking for a good Blink 182 dvd, don't buy this.If you're a fanatic and you buy every Blink 182 dvd or cd, still don't buy it. It's a piece of crap. It barely has any footage of Blink. Most of it is just old aquantences talking about them (not as thirlling or interesting as it sounds) They repeatedly show the people talk about the same topics, more than once. Not just each of them talking about the same thing, but they actually show them saying the same damn thing more than once, even more than twice! And it gets really irritating and boring.They also show this sucky surfing and skating footage time and time again. Also using crappy background music by some band that really sucks. Buy Urethra Chronicles 1 or 2 if you truly want a quality Blink 182 DVD."

1,This whiteboard is HORRIBLE,"It does NOT ""dry erase"" at all. It requires a ridiculous amount of rubbing or a spray of some cleaner to get the marker off. It defeats the whole purpose. Besides that, it is fine >:-/"
3,Dana's Review,"Of the eight different species, this film mainly focuses on the three species of bears in the region of North America, namely the polar bear, the grizzly, and the small omnivorous black bear. Whether captive or in the wild, the fascination we have for these animals only increases with this type of footage, some of which may be a little dangerous, because it desensitizes the danger to humans. Otherwise, it was enjoyable and left me wanting a little more."
4,Interesting....,"I'd always wondered how this interesting man achieved what he did at the Wadsworth Anthenaeum, and this book gave that information and much more. I look forward to visiting his fascinating residence in West Hartford sometime soon..."
4,Excellent Game for the Entire Family!!,I played this for the first time several weeks ago with three very bored teenagers and another adult. We ended up having so much fun I went out and ordered my own set and took it with me to a dinner part the following week. The four adults had nearly as much fun as the teenagers.I highly recomend this game for adults and teenagers. Some of the words the younger children might not know but they could certainly play on teams.This weekend will be a youth trip with 8 kids in an SUV for 5 hours each way. I'll be depending heavily upon this game to see us through!
2,Not worth the money,"The pen itself is ok, but nothing great. What's really bad is the way you select the pen, mechanical pencil or the stylus. Basically, you have to hold the pen at a horizontal position, turn the pen so the small markings idicating the type of tip extension is facing up and press the button at the end of the pen.I usually go back and forth a lot between the three tips and it is a hassle. There are pens out there that simply require a twist at the barrel to select the tips. These are great because you don't even have to look and its so much quicker. I've seen these for less than $10.The actual ballpoint pen is not much better than a $.05 plastic pens you buy in bulks. Where do they come up with these prices?"
4,Good Movie,This movie is an insperational film about the Human Spirit and the ability to perservere under any circumstance. This is a good movie that leaves you feeling uplifted. I would rate this movie slightly above average. For an entertaining evening this movie fits the bill.
1,This film really is taking the mickey,"In all honesty, this film is taking the mickey when it comes to the issue of egalitarianism in the armed forces. This is an issue that is very close to me as I have Asperger's syndrome (a condition on the autistic spectrum) and was rejected by the Army on account of this. However, I passed my Potential Officers Course yesterday, which is the first examination you have to do in order to gain entry to the Royal Marines. If an amputee were to try and become a Royal Marine Commando, I would think he was taking the mickey. This film serves to make a mockery of the issue of equal opportunities."
5,Big Oscar Actors! Therefore great ratings right? DFINITELY!,"Why do you think Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. are academy award winners? Becuase they deliver! A true story, great plot and story line, emotions skyhigh! A totally great movie! It has my bessing of ""Thumbs Up all the Way!"" A++++++"
2,Men of Honor,"Watchable and initially very interesting, but rather drawn out, long-winded and rather dated. Good performances by the leads, both Oscar winners and you can see why, though perhaps a little easy to see where the plot is leading. Worth a look if you are aware the issues are seemingly somewhat out of date although a very worthy story of its day."
2,to tight,this shorts are good but they are to tight i ware a 34w and that is what i got but they make these way deferent i would need a 36 or 38
4,Valuable,"While this one is not a page turner by any stretch, it is a valuable study of the colonial south, and anyone researching or studying that era and that locale should surely have this one on their list of reads."
3,Mediocre,"I already have a basic understanding but wanted to have a tape to listen to any changes. Granted there is a lot of repetition, but the lessons are short spurts and the second lesson repeats the first. I've only listened to half the CD set because of my busy time. However, the pronunciation is articulate and breaks it down to syllables, but if you forget where you leave off, you may misunderstand how to actually pronounce the whole word. I like how the narrator explains the sentence structure. It would be nice to hear more about cultural formality differences as I know there are levels of speech depending on status, age, and profession. Overall, the money's worth it to have it. Reasonable price and convenient to listen to."
3,Not for me.,"I've used Pimsleur products for Mandarin, Cantonese, and Spanish in the past, so when I decided to try to learn Korean, I naturally thought of Pimsleur. The Pimsleur method prides itself on not requiring (and usually not providing) any written material to go along with the lessons. For me, learning Korean this way doesn't work very well. I really need to see the hangul and or the romanization to get a good grasp of the pronunciation. Also, the Korean language seems to make a lot of social or class distinctions in the way it is spoken, more so than any other language I've studied. I assume this is why the phrases in the Pimsleur presentation, at least for the first few lessons are, for the same phrases, different from my other resources. So because of my auditory issues and my limited brain cell capacity, I've not continued on with Pimsleur Korean."
2,speak one sentence,"I have gone through 4 lessons. I have learned to say ""I can speak Korean, I can speak a little Korean and I can't speak Korean"". That covers most of what you learn in the 1st four lessons. I though I might learn to say a few different words. Knowing what I have gotten from the first 4 lessons I would never have bought this system."
4,Great Educational Toy!,"I bought this for my son's 5th Birthday and he loves it! He wants to put it together every single day and is getting better and better at recognizing the states' names and their geographical locations. Next up...the capitals! I recommend this to all parents concerned that their children aren't learning US geography as they should. And I confess that this puzzle has certainly helped refresh my memory of the states and their capitals, too."
5,Excellent puzzle,My five year old boys received this puzzle for their birthday. They have really enjoyed putting it together and have even learned several of the states. It's a great educational tool and is very well made. It is something they will use for a long time.
5,"read this, don'[t read this, it doesn't really matter",This was an excellent film that you should see with your friends and family.I would definetly rate this a 5 star!!!I enjoyed the film so much!I hope others enjoy it as well!
3,not bad,good movie to watch with your kids or family. kind of lame but if u like the genre then go ahead
5,Fantastic Fun!,"I thought the whole idea of mother and daughter switching bodies was so out-dated and so redundant that I almost skipped watching the movie with my sister and younger brother, but I was surprisngly wrong and I have not laughed this hard and enjoyed a romantic comdey this much in a LONG LONG time!!!The whole plot(which was first introduced in the '70s) was executed in such a clever, interesting, and unpredictable way, I forgot I was seeing a mother and daughter body switch movie and just enjoyed the hilarious performances by both actresses and endearing, real qualities that both evoked towards the audience.A must see for the whole family, ENJOY!"
3,cheesy yet touching,"If you a looking for a children's movie, ""Freaky Friday"" is the one you want. The kids will absolutly love it!In ""Freaky Friday,"" the relationship between daughter and mother, sister and brother, friends and friends or enemies are portrayed in the some how chaotic (and filled with detention)life of the main character. The clever banters and arguments are one of the facets that makes this movie as a acceptable entertainment.For adults and teenagers, this movie might seem stupid for the storyline had been played by other movies as well. However, a part that might grabs the attention of teenagers are the music played by the band, Pink Slip, of the main character. ""Ultimate"" and ""Take Me Away"" are two pretty good songs that make the movie a lot more lively."
3,"Not my favorite, but still pretty good.","""Freaky Friday"" stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.It's a movie about a mother and daughter switching places. They switch by opening up a fortune cookie at a Chinese Resturant.I thought it was a pretty good movie. Not one of my favorites; but still pretty good.The reason I didn't like this movie is because I guess I just didn't find it interesting enough."
4,Nice Resource,I think this is a great resource for emerging writers. Very simple and effective tool. Josh ClarkThe Bare Bones Book of Screenwriting
4,Explosive Reality,"I bought this video, because I teach Earth science in High School, and was looking for good REAL video footage of the kinds of incidents about which I teach. I remember when Mt. St. Helens exploded, and there was a VERY cool IMAX video where they flew through towns that were covered with LOTS of ash. This was not the video I expected, but it is still VERY good - a little too much slow-motion pyroclastic cloud formation. It drags a little too much for high school kids who generally do not care about these things. It is not a recreational movie, it is an educational movie that really brings home the destructive power that is held within these mountains."
2,Great Thinkers / Poor Writers,Good review but written in a style of a high school English term paper. I was expecting more insights and better writing.
5,Noble Performances of Sensitive Humanity,"This is a marvelous release. I've never heard Bach's WTC sound so light-fingered and humane. Aldwell's poetic use of tempo, rubato and touch-sensitivity succeed in freeing these often times motor-note pieces from ""metronome hell"". They really breathe.All you have to do is compare Jando's well-reviewed Naxos version of ""Prelude in C"" with Aldwell's to hear the profound difference between ""playing the notes"" and ""making music"". Even with this deceptively simple piece, Aldwell brings a lithe vulnerability to the same arpeggios with which Jando barrels up and down the keyboard in metronomic precision. Rest assured that Aldwell's playing throughout BOOK ONE remains just as intelligent and sensitive to the musical meaning of Bach's notes.(And why hasn't the otherwise fine Gramophone or Penguin Guide ever seen fit to review this CD? Shame on them!)"
3,Different image on puzzle we received,The first problem is that the picture posted for this item does not reflect the puzzle you receive. You do still receive a similar puzzle with a construction site scene.The larger problem is that the fittings on these pieces are SO TIGHT! They are hard to disassemble and reassemble. And they emit shards of loose wood constantly -- owie owie owie on little piggies!More Melissa and Doug quality control nonsene.
1,"lousy, lousy, lousy","This piece of tripe promises a lot and delivers very little. You like girl-girl scenes? You get a fake catfight and a scene where two women dressed as nuns hover mere inches away from each other's private parts, while the camera angles almost make you belive the fake-kissing and [contact] is real. The music is grade-Z porn, the sound is awful, and the whole thing looks like it was shot on someone's home video camera--you'd think that going through the effort of putting something on DVD would rate better video quality!..."
3,"Not bad, but...","This DVD is not really bad, but is should feature more of Aimee Sweet - she plays both the mysterious woman that the driver swerves to avoid and a nun at the end."
4,Wonderful adult glasses...,"I have a couple of dozen of these glasses and use them for both hot and cold beverages. I have broken 2 or 3 over the years but only when I should have known and been more careful. Care for them as you would for similarly priced wine glasses. I often use them for coffee rather than a large mug. They are great for iced tea but, again, put the ice cubes in after the beverage and don't use chipped ice as it may freeze together and expand. Let the kids use the jelly glasses though..."
5,Super comfortable,This boot is not only elegant looking but it is very comfortable to walk around with. I was afraid of buying them without trying them on first but now that I have them I consider it's been one of the best boot purchases I've made. I also got them in black.
3,Service good - product fair,This was less than I had hoped for. Very simplestic. Guess I should have expected it. Idiot's Guide.
4,the most exhilarating,"This compilation with the Crystal Method, DJ icey and more form together to form some the best exotic drum bass hits. This is one CD to get!"
2,A bit self-indulgent,"Muhlah! This wasn't a horrible book, but it reads too much like an inside joke. Muhlah! Not one of her best, not as good as the other two."
4,"Good fun, great music","This film may not be as powerful and profound as Lelouch's incredible 1995 ""Les Miserables"", but it's highly enjoyable and intelligent. It entertains with stories of jewel thefts and amnesia, while at the same gently poking fun at the romanticisation of melancholy. The restrained brooding of the main characters is a sharp contrast to the gorgeous landscapes around them and the cheerfulness of others, and somehow you can't help but chuckle at the antics of these two as they meander their way into a romance. The witty, nonlinear storytelling keeps you guessing to the end, and the wonderful music makes the journey all the more fun. A perfectly lovely way to spend two hours."
1,Dont buy this,"I have an exact clone of this cheap little thing with the ""GE"" label on it. It broke within a week, its stuck on ""8"" messages and none of the buttons work. I called them, they told me to unplug it (I already tried that) then they want me to mail it back to them, I'm not going to bother,by the time i pay the shipping and have no answering machine to use its not worth it. They could have at least put out a call tag for it."
3,"Good for pics, but not so good for video","I received the Olympus FE-140 for a birthday gift and there's some things are good and those that are disappointing.GOOD: Easy to take pictures and allows you to create settings, such as black and white, portrait, and night-time.BAD: Although it allows you to make a video, it lacks sound.I'll hold on to mine, but for video pictures, I'll borrow a camera that has video and sound."
1,"after i received product, i was wondering. coz it is a wrong product. what i got is 14, is not 10!!!!!","after i received product, i was wondering. coz it is a wrong product. what i got is 14, is not 10!!!!!Can i reture it without post fee. coz i think i do not have responsible for receiving wrong product!"
4,Quirkiness to spare,"I expected a quirky movie, but sometimes movies are too self-consciously quirky, and this is a good example. It feels like the writer, producer and director are trying too hard to be out-there. This is a hard movie to love.However, the cast is excellent, and it is always a pleasure to watch good actors practice their craft. Amy Adams has the meatiest part and is the only character who really gets developed. I gave the movie an extra star based on the performances.One word of warning: if you are in the habit of watching movies during meals (as I am), save this one for another time. There's some pretty gross stuff onscreen."
4,Entertaining,I see everyone under the sun has already said their piece about this movie. I can concur that it is cute and entertaining. Recommended.
1,Not family friendly,I was disappointed with the fowl language of this movie. They use the f word often along with others. It's not family friendly and I ended up throwing it in the trash.
2,Redundant Story Line,"First, the not so good ""how many movies have been made"" in which:(a.) Two sisters are polar opposites - somewhat functional working mom and dysfunctional street girl.(b.) One sister is raising her kid alone - somewhat poorly.(c.) Other sister is finding her way in life - also somewhat poorly.(d.) The mom to both sisters died a long time ago and the sisters haven't resolved the event yet.(e.) Dad hasn't resolved the event yet either or raised the sisters to resolve anything.Second, how this movie succeeds:(a.) Unique story that presented death with both an instructional and entertaining perspective.(b.) Story and acting had a natural flow that blended seamlessly to produce an entertaining 90 minutes with, of course, a feel good ending."
5,Perfect for our needs,"Our speech therapist requested we buy some peg puzzles, including some with animals. This farm animal peg puzzle is just perfect. And, it fits beautifully in the melissa & Doug puzzle rack."
5,Best Coldplay Non-LP,"I recently started trying to find all the Coldplay singles, most of which are hard to find. This is by far the best I've found so far. I would reccomend this highly to anyone who likes Coldplay at all, and it's a great first single with which to start a Coldplay collection."
4,good tire,"good tire, good price. since they are only 2 ply, i would recommend putting a puncture sealer, like ""slime"" in them if used for a lot of off roading."
4,"Yes, you CAN grieve for a long time","There is one plot device here that some readers question: whether someone can grieve for a loved one for a decade. I did, so I know that it is possible. Therefore, this book makes emotional and psychological sense to me in that respect. However, when the hero doesn't seem to recall the heroine after all these years...that does NOT make sense. Otherwise, this is a good read, with an alpha hero who is trying - but not succeeding - in becoming a gamma hero. Anne Stuart is currently famous for her gammas. If you prefer a somewhat more redeemable man, her earlier works are preferable (actually, I love all her books)."
3,"Good, not wonderful","I enjoy Anne Stuart, and purchased this book based on the reviews. While certainly not as dark of some of her more recent books, I was somewhat disappointed. In the forward, Anne indicates this story is an experiment for her. I was attracted to the romance of a heroine grieving for 10 years for her lost love, especially after she had only known the hero a few days (love at first sight and all), but I was put off by how dismal she was for that long period of time. And, after Danny/Mac's memory returned, I was surprised he didn't remember his passion for her. The mystery was a bit contrived as well."
3,Not for everyday use.,"The HP48G+ calculator is packed with features - but keep the owners manual within reach. You have to wade through the confusing keypad layout to find what you need. Simple operations are needlessly complex, for example, storing a number in memory involves creating a variable and assigning it the value instead of just storing in a numeric register. This calculator is trying too hard to be a computer. ..."
1,ANIMATION NEEDS WORK +BAD SPANISH,We have tried them all and this DVD was a disapointment. The animation was really bad as well as some of the articulation. Some situations did not relate to very young ones and it would not hold the attention of my child.
5,""" I Love""- Love and Basketball",This happens to be a favorite of mine. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again.
5,Great movie!,I can't believe how great of a movie this was! It wasn't a huge release of anything to make me believe it would have been that great. The plot was ineteresting and kept my attention. The charactors were wonderful. I highly recommend this movie.
5,Lovin' LOVE AND BASKETBALL,"My family likes sports movies. We all enjoyed LOVE AND BASKETBALL, so when my granddaughter requested a copy for her sixteenth birthday, I was very pleased to provide it to her. ""Love!"" ""Basketball!"" What's not to love?"
5,YES!,"One of the best movies of all time. Thank you very much and we are very happy to contribute to a college fund for a child! Great product, wonderful seller, fast shipping!"
5,Simply Spectacular,"When I first saw that Spike Lee was one of the Producers I was skeptical because I don't care for his work that much. However, this movie blew me away and is now one of my all time favorites! It is a must see for any die-hard romantic. It has something for everyone....sports, humor (Damn girl, I didn't know NIKE made dresses) to a spectacular love story that develops over several years and then withstands the test of time and many ups and downs. The last two scenes left me with goosebumps and has to be one of the most romantic endings ever to grace the silver screen. I also thought it was a nice touch that the movie was broken up into four quarters like a real game. I wish I could give it more than five stars."
5,Good mother daughter movie,"I watched this movie with my daughter, who is a sporty girl, especially basket ball. The mother daughter relationship in this movie is a bit like our relationship. It was a nice movie for us both to enjoy, especially together."
1,love and basketball,Ordered before Christmas and was told I would receive it by mid January. I still don't have the product and haven't had any updates in a few weeks. I really want the movie but would like to hear what's going on. :(
5,Super FUN!,"I can't think of a more descriptive word for this CD than FUN. This is a total fire-up, put on before you go out CD. It makes me want to dance, dance, dance and party all night long."
3,Mediocore,I thought their first record was fantastic and found myself playing it a lot. This album is kinda more of the same but certainly not as brilliant as the first. Dont find myself wanting to keep going back to it. Its a little dull asides from a couple of tracks.
4,Ta-Dah,"I have only recently become a Scissor Sister fan. I like most of their songs. Some get a bit to Bee Gee for me. But other than that I really love them. This CD is a good one, I listen to it all the time."
4,Disco Infused Fun!,"This album is simply fun! It is infused with pop, dance, disco and funk beats and rhythms that will definitely make you feel like dancing! There are 2 songs I don't really love, but overall, the album is a good listen and lots of fun!"
2,Difficult to read,The author explains his physical experience on awakening the Kundalini but fails to explain his spiritual experience.The book could take 50% more editing. His pseudo-scientific explantions are difficult to follow.
4,The Passion Lives Forever,"This CD brings back many great memories of the NFL's glory days of the late 60's and 70's. John Facenda's voice is incredible and the music gives me the chills. I gave the CD four stars instead of five because there is so much more music that was played more often on ""This Week in Pro Football"" and ""The NFL Game of the Week"" that were not included on this CD. Come on NFL Films and Tommy Boy Records, if you're listening (and we know you are) thousands of us are waiting for volume 2."
5,great for 3 y.o.,"my 3 y.o. fits her hand in here just fine, and can move the monkey's mouth correctly. My 18 month old can fit her hand/arm in but can't do the mouth yet - but she still loves to play with it. Seems well made; both kids enjoy."
2,Not so great,"If I'm honest, I really wanted to love this attachment, but it just doesn't work like it should. My advice, go to Sur la Table like I did and buy their metal 10 piece ravioli mold... it's wonderful! I wish I could return this Atlas attachment in a bad way."
1,Had higher hopes,"We LOVE to play Wise and Otherwise (the favorite), Balderdash, and Beyond Balderdash. This game seemed much like those. Unfortunately, the six of us that played it could almost always guess who had written which answer. It was not very exciting and we were all bored quickly. It was disappointing. (...)"
5,great game!,"Great game for parties with either close friends or people you don't even know! Ever since I got it for a close friend of mine for Christmas, she's been having more parties just to play that game! We were all laughing ourselves to sleep each time we played it."
5,Loaded Questions,"We have played this game with 2 different groups of people and each time have laughed until our sides hurt. It's most fun with more people. You could even play with more than the recommended number of people, you would just need to have some alternative markers (buttons, coins, monopoly pieces, etc. Don't let the short path from beginning to end fool you. It takes quite some time to get a winner. Great fun!"
5,Family Game thats is very fun,"I bought this for Christmas for a family member, hoping that it would be fun. I was right. In short, it's a fun family game/group game that does not get old. We have played it and played it and it is just so much fun. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Laughing until I cried.,My husband and I took this game to a college reunion weekend and it was a hit. We laughed 'til we cried.
5,review,The game Loaded Questions is so much fun! It is a great get to know you game. Friends and family love to play. We laugh the entire time. A great addition to any game closet!
4,Fun,We got this for our parents for Christmas last year and we've had a lot of fun as a group playing it. We got a lot of laughs
5,Best Game I've Played in a Long Time,"This really is one of the best games I have played in a long time. As game fanatics, we are always looking for a great new game. This one kept us laughing for hours. The roll on the floor type laughs! I would highly recommend it. It is a great way to learn things about your friends and family. It's more than just a game. We are hoping for a second edition or some refill cards."
5,Excellent fun!,"I read a few other reviews and noticed that some people find this game boring. I really don't know why. I played this with my husband and 4 other friends and we had a blast! We have all known each other for 5 or more years, so sometimes it was easy to pick who said what, but often times we each got stumped. For people who played this with close friends who said they got bored - they obviously are not trying hard enough! The point of the game is to guess who said what, but each player should also be trying to foil the other players. Of course there are the wrong people to play this with - if I played it with my mom, it would probably be boring and un-enjoyable. With this game you should push yourself to be creative with your answers because that is what makes it so much more interesting."
2,"Too much theory, not enough 'music'","Although an accomplished musician and with thorough knowledge of music theory, this book is too much theoretic for me. I can't get hold of the message..."
2,"Building a Jazz vocabulary, This book needs help",I really don't like this book very much and would not reccomend it to anyone. As a musician who would write a book and do it all in C Major. I'm also a student at a community college and today I attempted an assignment and when I needed to transfer information onto paper from the textbook the information in here was not helpful enough and I shall be telling my teacher and looking for a different book.
1,Caulked full of the occult....,"Even though the book is categorized as gothic genre, in reality it is a work of fiction which totally revolves around witchcraft -- imitative magic with waxen images, pentagrams, Sator formulas, covens, black mass, clairvoyants, animal sacrifices, incantations, possessed animals (attendant demons). Only because a reading group had chosen this book did I persevere and finish. This book was my first Susan Howatch; will probably be my last."
4,Classic movie Serial,"Flash Gordon: Box Set (Space Soldiers/Flash Gordon's Trip To Mars/Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe) (3DVD)This classic serialtogether with Buck Rogers, The Phantom Empire, and The Adventures of CaptainMarvel were my favorites among the Saturday afternoon cliffhangers."
4,Where it all began,"If you wish to own the Flash Gordon movie serials, this (for the time being) is your absolute best buy. It doesn't have any extras and the film quality is 'good' at best, but unless someone gives this the deluxe blu ray treatment, there's no other version worth getting but these. I got into these films because of the Star Wars Saga, and it's neat for me to see how Lucas was obviously influenced in each movie by these. There's another, UNDERSEA KINGDOM which also seemed to influence him on Phantom Menace. Hope to check out BUCK RODGERS soon as well. BTW - If you have an interest in learning more about these serials while watching, I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking out the book about FLASH GORDON SERIALS BY MCFARLAND PRESS. I bought it on here as well, and it's been my constant companion while going through all these serials. A must own for any STAR WARS fan, or anyone interested in pure escapist entertainment from a bygone era. For sci-fi geeks, this is where it all began."
3,Silly but a lot fun,"I'd call it goofy but lots of fun. The science is silly and so are the special effects, as Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov blast off to the planet Mongo to alter it's course with earth or something. The action occurs so quickly, it's hard to keep track of it, it's one terrible menace and death trap after another for Flash and Dale.I particularly like the triangle between Flash, Dale and the pretty and treacherous Princess Aura, daughter of the Emperor Ming, the main villain here.It's quite a bit of fun to watch once you get around the goof ball costumes and junk science, there's loads of action and it goes at a furious pace.Buster Crabbe is pretty good, for an actor who isn't remembered all that well."
5,Amazing...........,This movie was the most touching movie I have seen in a VERY long time. I was left in a state of shock at the end - I can't believe this was a true story. Hilary's acting was excellent and the director definitely deserves many awards for this picture. I recommend this movie to everyone.
3,BRUTAL!,"This film is totally raw and certainly does not hold back. I can see why Hilary Swank won the Oscar. She seemed totally absorbed in the role. There are some discrepancies in the storyline (particularly the ending), compared to the actual documentary footage I've seen. But overall, it was a gutsy piece of work for newcomer Kimberly Pierce. A good film, but I certainly wouldn't buy it."
2,"Great Acting, Horrible & Sick Storyline","Hilary Swank desirved evrything she won for this film but the rest of the actors and the story itself shouldn't have won anything, If Swank wasn't in this I wouldn't have given it any stars. It made so sick that this actually happened in reality. One of 99's WORST along with American Bueaty."
5,Girls Cry,"I thought Hillary Swank and Choloe Sevigny did amazing performances. There were times where you could tell Hillary was a female though but overall she meshed into her character flawlessly. The only part I didn't like in the film is the rape sequence. At that point I already hated the 2 guys so when they raped Tina Brandon, I wanted to skip past the scene. Actually I ended up hating the entire family including the mother because they were poor white trash and totally incompassionate. This was an interesting story and there wasn't a dull moment. I almost wanted to cry at the end when the cop was interviewing Tina Brandon, and she told him the reason why she was doing what she was doing was because of sexual identity crisis."
1,This movie was awful,"I don't know whow the academy voted for Hillary Skank over Annette Bening for American Beauty. There was no contest in who gave the better performance - Annette bening in American Beauty - by a landslide.This movie is a ""having-a-tooth-drilled-without-novocaine"" experience.Spare yourselves the boredom.Valerie"
1,BOYS DONT WATCH THIS STUPID MOVIE,First off this is one of the most disgusting movies i have ever seen.I think this movie was an absolute disgrace and I dont know why alot of the Americans were obsessed with this trashy movie.I'm glad Amercian Beauty won the awards and i dont know how Annete Benning lost to that lousy actress in this movie Boys Dont Cry.If you got about two hours to spare then watch this movie better yet dont watch it if you go two hours to spare and watch the discovery channel.This movie is just nasty.I dont care if it is a true life story its sick.
5,should be more widely available,"Orson Welles - Narrator [Voice]Elizabeth Taylor - Narrator [Voice]Arnold Schwartzman - Director / Producer / ScreenwriterRabbi Marvin Hier - Producer / ScreenwriterMartin Gilbert - ScreenwriterElmer Bernstein - Composer (Music Score)Robert Jenkis - EditorRoy Watts - Editor'Genocide is the story of man's inhumanity to man - the story of the millions of men, women, and children who fell victim to Hitler's Final Solution"" A unique multi-image documentary, it combines historical narrative with actual stories of ordinary pople caught up in the Nazi's reign of terror.copyright 1981 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and winner of an Academy Award for best documentary feature 1981.[text copied from the video sleeve]running time: 83 minutes in COLOR; Digitally recorded"
2,Almost Perfect! But not quite!,"We just tried to watch the 6th and final dvd of the NYPD Blue, Season 2 set we purchased. The dvd makes a loud humming sound that gets louder as it plays - though it does play, the noise is too distracting to keep playing. Other than that, the rest play fine."
5,"New York's finest, pre-911","These were the hey days for 'Blues. Everyones characters were pretty well established. The show was always a good mix of drama, humor with a little spice thrown in. This was back when TV was worth watching...kudos to Amazon for sharing the series"
3,Kindle version full of errors,"I want to give this one star because the Kindle version is pathetically error-ridden. But the book is great so I can't bring myself to do it.To be clear -- there will be a confusing error in every screen on your kindle. ""clean"" becomes ""dean"", etc. It really impacts the reading experience. I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality control. Apparently Amazon does not actually have humans read (or even a computer run a grammar check) on more obscure titles. So I'll be at my local used book store for my Lem."
3,plastic storage bags,bags are a good size and weight to store small woolen blankets. clips to seal bags fall off the end. i have these same bags from packmate manufactured in japan i obtained many years ago and they close easily and the clip stay in place. seems like overall quality has decreased and fails to meet previous standards.
3,be careful!!,"the string on the fishing pole is long enough to wrap around a child's neck and if it gets twisted around the ""hook"" end of the pole, it can get caught. My 3 year old nephew started crying and he had it stuck around his neck just barely loose enough to get undone. He was fine once we untwisted it, and we immediately tied a knot to make the string shorter, but be careful!!"
3,best value around,While there wasn't the detail I'd hoped for I believe it'll be an asset while traveling.
1,Disapointing detail,"Waste of money in my opinion. Fails to show important mountains, ridges and other terrain."
5,"James Taylor-esque, and GREAT",This was a special acoustic release - probably under pressure from the new record company (Home Sweet Home/Chris Christian).But what a great album. Sounds like James Taylor doing better material than James usually does.If you want rock - go for the good Dominoes or the great Victims of The Age album. If you want modern sophisticated pop rock get Ashes and Light or Mosaics. If you want folk rock get one of the last three albums. If you want pop ballad acoustic style this is the album - until Appalaichan Melody gets released.
1,A movie better left dead.,"Lousiest movie ever.Please watch the classics and stop at H20.I am glad that I managed to put my two cents regarding this movie before other tasteless people say that this is the best movie of the series.I get annoyed when no talent directors can only make a name for themselves by rehashing a classic to today's standards, and ruin the whole concept of what made this movie such a landmark.Lets throw in a bunch of lousy no name actors, a classic Jamie Lee Curtis (total film time 8 minutes), some out of place nudity, and usual blood. Mix, then shake twice, put in the microwave for an instant tv dinner horror flick.Truly, we have lost the concept of what makes scary movies, and obviously the person above knows nothing of good talent."
2,*sigh*,"Well, it was Halloween so I thought I'd give this flick another chance. I thought another viewing might help me to change my mind about it but alas, sorry no. I give this movie 2 stars, 1 for Jamie and 1 for ""The Shape"". Everything else is just terrible. Ok, decent but not good, reason for Michael's return. At the end of H20 you can clearly see the hate and desire in Michael's eyes to kill his sister, but come to find out, oops, Laurie killed a policeman that had his throat ripped out by Michael. My bad? Another thing I don't quite get, I know Laurie would, of course, want to be sure that it is Michael, but no way do I believe she'd let herself get that close to him. I can only hope that there's another Halloween with Jamie. And that Laurie proves to be as indestructible as her brother. Terrible waste."
4,SOOOO much better than H20!!!!!,"i was so mad with the people who made H20, H20 SUCKED!!! Halloween 8 was very well made and with the Director Rick Rosenthal (Director of Halloween II) He brought something to Halloween that H20 couldn't, a good scare!!! Still i was a little mad that they killed off Ms.Strode but at least the Halloween movies r back. i say that cause they said H20 was the last, THANK GOD IT WASN'T, CAUSE IT WAS SOOO BAD. this movie has revived the Halloween franchise!!! funny thing is that they didn't have too much hype for Halloween 8 and all the hype went to Jason X, and Halloween did so much better at the box office than Jason X. (Oh by the way, Jason X sucked) Myers is still the man and this movies still rock. so check this one out IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD!!!!"
1,WHAT IN THE [heck]!!!!!,did the writer somehow forget one vitally important fact? Michael Myers is DEAD!!!!! His head was chopped off in the previous movie!!!...
2,"A Weeping, Cinematic Boil on the Bottom of an Already Played-Out Series","Quite possibly the pinnacle of idiotic, unnecessary horror sequels (save, perhaps, JASON X), HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION is pointless in the extreme and only for franchise completists. With a cast led by the foul-mouthed Shark-Shark Binks himself, Busta Rhymes, and a career-defining performance by narcissism-royalty Tyra Banks as some chick who thinks she's Tyra Banks, how could you go wrong? Bring Michael Myers back from the dead with a flimsy insult to audience intelligence; destroy the last thread of the myth within the first 15 minutes, making the ensuing 75 minutes all-the-more inexplicable; and drag the legend into the 21st century with a plot centered around the internet, reality television, and instant messaging. That oughta do it - and they do, with excruciating abandon. The result is a weeping, cinematic boil on the bottom of an already played-out series that John Carpenter wisely washed his hands of a long time ago."
2,One of the worst movies ever made shame on them,Don't they realize that Halloween isn't fun anymore. Plesence is dead and this was his series. They killed off Jamie Lee Curtis and now the two main characters are dead. They could have brought Jamie Strode back if they hadn't killed her which may have saved the series for a nineth which will be coming out soon but it will be a turkey. Seeing new people get killed in the eight part of a series is just plain old. It's not any good. History will have three great slashers. Freddy Michael and Jason but everything comes to an end. They fail to realize that. It's over can anyone accept that. When Halloween 9 comes out i'll see it at the movies but I know it will be bad. I guess we fans still love it anyway.
1,Horrible,"I have seen the entire series now. One and two were very good. Enjoyable movies. As it progressed it spiraled downward. H20 was rather good, though the eighth, resurection was absolutely horrible. Stay away."
1,A SLAP TO THE FACE/ NO STARS!,"halloween 8: I recieved this so called film as a gift,That is the only reason I still have a copy.This thing is awful,they show promise with part 7 then kick you in the groin when busta rhymes?!? shows up.WHY IN THE NAME OF ALL THINGS HOLY DID THEY KILL LAURIE STRODE IN SUCH A STUPID WAY? I know they wanted to end her story line,but she comes off like a LAME idiot.HORRIBLE DIALOGUE,a retarded story,and busta rhymes as comic relief.PUT IT THIS WAY,I'LL WATCH PART 3 BEFORE I WATCH 8 AGAIN."
2,Interesting try,"Unfortunately after Halloween H20,the Halloween series as become a typical teen slasher series but the concpet of Halloween Resurrection interested me enough to see it.There's a show on T.V. called Sacrest Places On Earth hosted by Linda Blair,that is the bases of this film get a family or a bunch of kids together,give them video cameras and get them to see if the house is haunted or what.That was the only thing I really liked about this film,also on the speical features,there's a web cam special which lets you watch 40 mins of the film from the characters POV by their cams.Forget watching the whole film just go to the webcam special instead,it's more entertaning to watch then the movie itself."
2,Not the Best Halloween in The Series,"Halloween Resurrection is the 8th in the Halloween Series. It's about two people who are trying to make a reality show on the internet called ""Dangertainment."" They selected a group of teenagers to go in the Michael Myer's House to find out why Michael Myers became psycho.Jamie Lee Curtis died in the first 15 minutes, and that'sprobably the most entertaining part of the movie. The rest of the movie is plain boring. The teenagers in this movie are so dumb. A girl died because she couldn't get through the gate. She could've made it. But Michael Myers killed her before she made it pass the gate."
2,Fear is never completely delivered...,"Years later, after the first film made by John Carpenter, there is still evil lurking around in Haddonfield, IL. This time there is a bunch of college students that are participating in a live broadcast on the Internet where they are supposed to find out about the secret of Michael Myers. This is supposed to be done by putting the college students in the birth home of Michael Myers over night so they can seek an answer to why he began his murder spree. However, one teenager after another seems to fall under the large blade of Michael Myers, but will the secret of Michael Myers be revealed? Halloween: Resurrection is an extremely predictable horror film where the characters are mindless and incoherent with fear, which ruins the cinematic experience. Nevertheless, there are scares and frights that will cause fear and alarm within the audience."
1,Teribble movie,"This movie sucks eggs. As I have said before, stick with the real halloween trilogy: 1, 2, and 7.P.S. Do not even attemptt to see halloween nine, because from all the reports I hear Jamie Lee Curtis will not come back in it."
1,"Keeps on Going, and Going, and Going...","This is, without a doubt, THE-WORST Halloween film in the series, right next to H2O and ""The Curse of Micahel Meyers"". Not only is it NOT SCARY AT ALL, it's EXTREMELY boring! Also, LAURIE DIES! I agree. No matter how bad H2O was, it still should of ended there."
4,HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION A SMART & WORTHY SEQUAL,"After the awfull H20 most Halloween fans felt puzzled and dissapointed, I know I was. The people who made Halloween Resurrection knew what they were doing, using reality tv because that what is most popular now a days. As for the characters I am glad Jamie Lee Curtis didn't have a big role in the film because she didn't deserve it after spitting in the face of Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris by making H20. H20 was the worst sequal of the series and the people ho made it including (CURTIS) just ignored parts 4-6 which were quite good in my opinion. I believe that you could by Resurrection and ignore Halloween H20 and your series would be complete! The only thing this sequal had wrong was no man in black and no thorn plot. Show respect towards this film"
3,its ok but no way a fantastic film,THE FIRST 17 MIN ARE AWESOME BUT THE REST OF THE FILM IS OK...ITS A GOOD FILM IF U R BORED AND JUST WANT SOMETHING TO WATCH TO PASS TIME....BUT IM A HUGE HALLOWEEN FAN IVE SEEN ALL THE FILMS 10000 TIMES A PIECE AND THE WAY THEY KILLED LAURIE STRODE WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE CHARACTER AND THE HARD CARE HALLOWEEN FANS...BUT IF U R A COLLECTOR...BUY THIS FILM JUST FOR THE FIRST 17 MIN
2,how much more can we milk this!!,"this was horrible, it's such a disgrace from carpenter's original. sadly busta rhymes was the best one in this movie, it's ..., but i guess the american way of doing things is make a buck, ... a buck. anyways, the best scene is when busta is dressed like myers trying to scare the teens in the house and sees the real myers. he starts talking jive sort of, saying words like ... and such, that's why i gave it 2 stars. after that scene busta dies, and we continue on with this blair witch ..., blah blah blah, and myers gets burnt only to have some dumb woman open the bodybag and have a closeup of myer's eye open and the woman screaming ooooooo!!the only thing now is for myers to go into outerspace and fight jason, freddy, chucky, and buddy lee. i might have given this 3 stars if the director (who also did part2 which was actually good) shuffled out an extra few mil and hired hulk hogan to do the legdrop to michael myers."
4,I Stand Corrected!!!,"In my initial review of this film I immediately bashed it and did not give it a chance. Saying it was not worth the money to go and see another Michael Myers flick. Well, I stand corrected. Halloween Resurrection is different then the previous stories.The movie about 6 young adults spending the night in the old Myers house for an audience over the internet. Well as you know Michael doesn't take kindly to people lurking around in his house. The movie also wastes no time in getting right into the action and a battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.In my humble opinion no Halloween movie will ever match the original but if you are a fan of the Halloween movies, Halloween Ressurection is worth a look. When Halloween 9 comes out I'm sure I will check that one out as well."
3,Good Beguining Horrible Plot,The first part of the movie gives a great beguinning. Laurie finally gets whats comming to her. After that the movie gets pointless!! Why did they have this plot of the whole Dangertainment-Online thing? I hope that this is a stepping stone for the next movie. Like he came home from killing his sister to find a few ... kids in his house. Anyway dont buy this movie rent it.
1,"Poor, poor Michael","To take such an inspirational character like Michael Myers drag him into such miserable, no shame, waste-of-a-film should be a crime. What the heck is Busta Rhymes and Tyra doing in this film!??? You don't see Michael trying to sing or modeling a dress, do you? What's worse is that they try to jump on the whole Blair Witch reality TV garbage. At least Freddy and Jason have enough integrity to slash any flashy wanna be actor celebrities. Save your money."
5,Halloween Resurrection -ROCKS!!!!,This did a much better job than wat jason x did.this is much more scary suspense sick and sexy and launches a new start to the halloween movies.jamie lee curtis is back joined by some new brilliant stars!!!this rocks
1,Didn't Michael switch with a paramedic?,"Okay, it seems like forever ago that H20 came out, but if I remember correctly, the spoiler for that ending was that Michael switched with a paramedic that came to put him in the ambulance. Makes sense to me, ya just can't keep Michael down. He knocked the paramedic out, switched clothes and used some paramedic [stuff]to keep the mask on his face. Notice when Jamie Lee hits him with the ambulance he is tripped out and pulling at the mask? Then, he reaches out for help at the end before she slices and dices his head off? Another opinion is that this is going too far having Busta in the movie... Who is he supposed to be? Changing the characters huh? Probably cuz no one wanted to agree to the deal and they probably offered Jamie Lee a lot of money to be in it. lol =)"
1,"Even John Carpenter Passed on This idea! ""Let it Die"".","Don't be fooled. This movie has little to do with the original. It is simply Friday the 13th - part 14. Characters are unimportant in this film, plot is unimportant too...and without those two elements having some strength, nobody will care about the action...so repetitive that suspense would require a miracle. If you have never seen a ""slasher movie"" and are about 10 years old, then you may find something new in this one...otherwise, save your money and rent a good copy of Halloween I or Halloween II."
2,Dissapointing...,"Im a big Halloween movies fan....while i thought this one would good and unique, it was anything but that.First of all, its very dissapointing to see that the continuation of H2O was simply Michael Myers not actually dying, rather fleeing away through some bushes dressed as a paramedic.And then Jamie Lee Curtis being eliminated without a follow up at the beginning of the movie paves the way for what is one of the worst horror films ive seen lately.The concept of having some people in Michael's house is not terribly bad, but the fact that they made it so to today's standards of ""horror films"" just discredited the whole movie. So many characters with pointless roles, this whole rapper celebrity trying to fist fight Michael Myers, its just too many elements that don't help.I don't recommend it at all. If you are a Halloween fan, you will be highly dissapointed by this one."
1,Waste of time,"This movie stinks. Don't waste your time with this very uncool and unhip movie. Total posers. If you have seen Faster Pussycat Kill Kill, and are expecting more of the same, then your are in for a major disappointment. ...."
3,Good but not great,"Man I'm a big fan of Skull, but this album was lacking that fire that he's known for. It has a few brite spots but compared to his last albums, no comparison. P-Zeek"
3,A little over rated,"Would a game of death been the masterpiece everyone thinks it would of been?Well having seen the footage assembled here,which I'm extremely grateful for here,all I can say is it's a difficult call.The fights no doubt are still astounding,the original storyline outlined here thought provoking,but Lee's acting throughout is otherwise seems stilted,wheras with Enter the Dragon it got more natural no doubt in part to a longer shooting schedule.The documentary itself is great but could'nt someone who could lip read subtitle some of the footage where the audio went missing?And where was the ode to an artist music video,or the rest of the 90 minutes of outakkes which could of easily fit on the disc.Still all in a must see for even casual fans even if it does end with sort of a graveside f off from the caretaker."
4,A Found Treasure,I enjoyed all but one of Bruce Lee's 4 movies. That one was The Game of Death. It was poorly edited & looked like it was made in 2 weeks. A Warrior's Journey show's the true ending Bruce edited. Although not completely mastered the concept of what Bruce actually wanted to do with this film comes through. If your a fan of Bruce Lee this new footage is a must see.
4,A great buy for any Lee fan.,"This disk is a nice buy; it features a well-done biography with many footages of Bruce I haven't even seen before. Most of his casual fans'll learn alot from this, and I would highly recommend it to them. Heck, even veteran fans might learn something new. Well anyway, it tells you about how Bruce saw martial arts, lived his life, saw things, etc, etc... Basically, it's what a biography on a person should be.But the real awesome thing here is the rare, uncut scenes from ""The Game of Death."" The footage is about 40 minutes long, and quite satisfying as well. Thing is, I thought they would actually find and show some scenes that took place outside of the pagoda, but there aren't any at all. Ah well, it's still great. At least I knew how Bruce wanted it to be.Kudos to the people who found the footage that was lost for an amazing 28 YEARS.Overall, this is definatley worth getting. I liked it alot, and hopefully you will to if you decide to go on and buy it."
2,"Tedious, ill-conceived, sophomoric","The plot was shallow and poorly developed, as were the characters. I just think this was an idea that should never have gone beyond a first draft. In fact, there are points in the novel where I was quite certain I was reading a first draft! If you enjoy reading a sappy ""Hallmark"" story, you will love this book."
5,A Redbird Christmas. A novel by Fannie Flagg,One of the funniest and most charming books I have read. A friend loaned me her copy. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a copy to give to one of my friends for Christmas. A real feel-good book. I actually found myself smiling while reading it.
4,Pleasent Thoughts,"I found A Redbird Christmas to be one of the most entertaining and relaxing books I have ever read. Fannie Flagg's descriptions of people, places, and moments make it all very alive."
4,Quite a good read,This is a god story simple and short...only downfall about it in my eyes is that there isnt enough Christmas in it...I love to read books about Christmas and had hopped it would be more about it...but anywho great quick read
5,"The ""Secret"" town is Magnolia Springs, AL!","I received ""A Redbird Christmas"" from my husband last year as an early Christmas gift. He casually remarked that the book was about our town, Magnolia Springs, AL. I just laughed and proceeded to page 1....shortly thereafter I came across one of the characters, whose name is 'real' and who became one of my best friends after we recently moved to Magnolia Springs, and I almost fainted!!! Well, enough from all the folks that wanted to know where this secret town is...but I can't divulge any more about the characters and plot. You must read for yourself! Oh, the jacket drawing is also real....we relax in our boat many times just under the bridge on hwy. 49....dreams do come true...now if i can just get my 'named friend' to introduce me to the magnificent Miss Flagg!!! Happy reading. jw"
5,Cover to cover in six hours,"I found myself totally absorbed in this lovely, sweet book. I started it mid-afternoon on a Saturday and six hours later finished it. I couldn't have put it down if I'd tried. And I did NOT want it to end! (I'm told that's the highest praise one can pay an author.) The characters are believable, the story line mostly believable (who cared?) and the overall product amazingly fulfilling. It was like pushing away from the table after a banquet...just that satisfying! Thank you, Fannie, for your delightful contributions to the literary world."
4,a charming cultural exploration,"Frontera Street displays a cross-culturalism that breaks down the elitist assumptions of the upper class. I love when Dee figures out that ""Barrio"" means ""Neighborhood,"" not ""Slum."" After a slow start, I was drawn into the story and found I could identify with all three narrarators, regardless of their ethnic background."
2,VBA for Novice Modelers,This is not an advanced book. Most of the references are very generic in nature and utilize approaches that I've have used previously. I didnt get much out of this book.
3,"Not too bad, but thawing/cooking instructions were out to lunch","Instructions say to thaw in the fridge for 48 hours and cook in the bag at 400 for 3 hours. In reality, it needs 96 hours in the fridge to thaw properly, and I cooked it at 325 till the interior was 165. This took over 4 hours. The whole thing was reasonably moist, but it fell apart while trying to carve it. This is because there was no whole chicken or duck inside, it was pieces along with a ton of stuffing. It was very tasty but it looked more like just a pile of stuffing on the plate. Bottom line - it's quite overpriced. One of these days I'd like to try one that's put together the way it's supposed to be."
3,Maybe I missed something!,"The Thoenes are among my favorite authors, but this is not one of my favorites. There were lots of characters, which is fine, but it took a long time for the story to get going. The book is advertised as a stand alone novel, but there it seems to me that there is no ending. The lives of most of the characters are left dangling--including those who are in previous books. Maybe I am missing something, but I was disappointed."
3,Information regardign Twilight of Courage and the Zion Covenant Series,"Portions of the Twilight of Courage were republished in ""directors cut format"" in the last three books in Theone's Zion Covenant Series (London Refrain, Paris Encore, and Dunkirk Crescendo). I guess Twilight of Courage wasn't as popular as this series so when the Theone's republished the Zion Covenant Series they added the characters / stories featured in Twilight.For more information or for suggestions on which order to read the books visit www.thoenebooks.com"
4,Needs a sequel . . . !,"I have enjoyed many of the Thoene's works and I thoroughly enjoyed Twilight. I enjoy receiving an education on world history as well as being entertained. However, I really need a sequel to wrap up HOW (as in ""who"", ""where"" and ""what"") the allies finally put it together to restore world peace."
4,The Santa Trap,I purchased this as a gift for my mother. She was very pleased at how quickly it arrived and also the method of deliver. Two thumbs up!
3,Mini is certainly right!,"I was not expecting theseto be quite so small in overall size, as they are probably only 1/3 the size of my regular corded clippers. I purchesd them to clip a bridlepath, muzzle, and ears of my horse and they do work well for that purpose. I just can't imagine trying to do anything more than that."
2,difficult to use,"I am an appraiser and use desk calculators beside my pc keyboard. I have been using TI calculators for many years, but this one is not very good IMO. The buttons are not sensitive (no feedback), one must press firmly and look and the display to make sure the numbers entered are correct. Even when pressing firmly, frequently the numbers do not register. The memory (+, -) functions are also non responsive - there is no indication (feeback) the numbers have been recognized/entered. Other units I have used at least blink each time the M+ or M- buttons are pressed. Recently, I have had better luck with Casios and will give one a try."
5,Moonpies,"Moonpies, I like Moonpies, Moonpies are good for me!My children and I find ourselves singing this song through the grocery store, after putting a box of Moonpies in the cart, and we never really liked Moonpies before. Beware of this track, it is addicting! But oh so enjoyable!And the story about Mrs. Lunchroom lady is equally addicting. You'll wish you had a hot bread and butter sandwich for yourself.Try it! You'll love it!"
2,Our least favorite Bill Harley collection,"My boys (4 and 7 years old) and I are big fans of Bill Harley's ""There's a Pea on my Plate"" and ""You're in Trouble"" but we didn't enjoy this one nearly as much."
2,They don't last,"Have 3 of them - they work great while they last! I have had to replace two of the three - the first after one year, the second after two years. At this rate it's cheaper to replace the bulbs than to try to conserve energy by having the lights go on when it gets dark rather than setting the lights to go on earlier. Not worth the money."
1,Good while it lasts,"I like the idea that I don't have to keep fussing with the timer setting as the seasons change. On the plus side, it works flawlessly, but only for about two years, then it dies catastrophically. My second one in just over 4 years just suddenly failed. At $15 a pop it's just not worth it. I'm going to find a new solution."
1,"No instructions, no usage","This product may or maynot operate as stated, but Malibu fails to provide any instructions on how this product is to be connected. As such, this product cannot be used. Don't waste your money."
2,Another typical action movie,"Okay, this movie wasn't great, but it's exactly like all those action movies with Jean Claude or Segal, very implausible and very corny. The fire and action scenes alone are worth the rental and seeing a new face is refreshing. Howie Long has the same acting abilities as most of the action heroes, but unfortunately his name doesn't hold the same clout as Jean Claude or Segal. He is extremely plausible as a fire fighter/action hero/ax thrower as he saves lives and jumps from airplanes. Don't expect a masterpiece, just an entertaining movie for few bucks."
3,Sound makes the Movie,"Though the movie lacks a lot as far as plot, it is non-stop excitement with tremendous sound effects. For those who own DVD players and a descent home theater system, you will feel as if you are in the middle of a forest fire."
5,Excellent !,"Stella Adler makes clear why she was and would be one of the best acting teachers of all time. Her passion, philosophy and love for acting and actors remain thanks to this incredible book."
4,appreciating Adler's genius,curiosity pays off! Probing the mind/beliefs of this icon is greatly rewarding. Will surely contribute to both personal performance and the scripts I write for every day existence.
4,Never listen to the suits,"This follow-up to Reunion Wildnerness was weakened by the apparent demands of management to produce a synth-driven pop sound, ultimately diluting this band's sounds. There are a couple of gems: ""Collide"" and ""Blue Sky in the Morning"", both hook laden and driven by Gary Newby's distinct vocals."
4,Light-Weight Fun With Dame Margaret,"Dame Margaret Rutherford makes an unlikely but extremely entertaining ""Jane Marple"" in this film version of Agatha Christie's novel ""Mrs. Maginty's Dead."" In spite of considerable tampering with the character, the film is fairly faithful to the plot of one of Christie's more widely praised novels, concerning a young man wrongly suspected of murdering his landlady.Of the four Miss Marple films starring Dame Margaret, this one shows the actress' celebrated eccentricities to their best advantage, and Rutherford fans will be delighted by her broad and extremely charming performance. Christie purists and those looking for weightier fare will be disappointed, but for some truly lightweight entertainment with a 1960s British tone, Dame Margaret and company are hard to beat."
1,Awful,"Just so painful in comparison to the genius that is ""All at Once"". I had never heard of Paulson until I heard ""Window Frames"" on Pandora. After getting a hold of a number of songs across multiple albums, I found myself wondering if this album was the same Paulson! I thought maybe they were two different bands! The songwriting is like night and day. Whatever happened between this album and ""All at Once"", this was the rehearsal. All at Once is the symphony.I would recommend downloading ""Nightfall"" where you can find it. Otherwise get yourself a copy of their new album."
2,Don't like it much,"I love grape anything! But this has such a strong aftertaste, that the grape flavor kind of disappears. I've only put the drops in water to drink. I don't know what else to do with it. I love the vanilla creme in my coffee!!"
3,"Great, but edible!","My 11 week old Chihuahua immediately fell in love with the comfort of the pet bed. We really couldn't find her under the blanket. Unfortunately, she loved it so much, she ate it. She ate the zipper so now it won't zip. Then that allowed her access to claw her way into the pillow and take out the stuffing. This all happened in 7 days.I think it would have been best to have the zipper on the very bottom of the bed since she doesn't flip it over. And it probably should be velcroed/hook and loop taped."
3,Should have trusted the other reviews,"Just a little disappointed with this one. Another review said...""pillow, what pillow?"" and they were right! It was a nice sized pet bed but the pillow was flat as a fritter! I thought they left the stuffing out. Turned out that my cat took it over so it hasn't gone to waste.Petmate 25-Inch Burrow Bed, Navy Blue"
5,Our second of these,"After two years, the first finally became too threadbare to be allowed to continue. We retired it to the recycle bin and purchased another immediately. Our Fox Terrier sleeps well nowhere else."
5,Petmate Burrow Bed,"I bought the Burrow bed because my dachshund loves to be covered, he hates to be cold. He got into the bed the first day. He doesn't use it exclusively, he still has a fondness for his old bed. But he uses it half the time and when the A/C is cranked up we don't need to worry, he burrows in."
4,My doggie is queen of the castle!,This bed is great for my teacup yorkie(3 lbs). The only thing is the top doesn't stay up so I rigged it myself with a puppy proofed wire hanger to complete her cave. She loves it! So glad the top will keep her warm in the summer when we have on the ceiling fan and warm in the winter from the drafty bedroom window. :) Great for small dogs!
3,Burrow Bed in Navy,I was disappointed with my purchase of this bed. It was intended for my cat who likes to burrow to hide. But the fabric is too bulky for a cat and the base has no indentation. The cat is just lying down on a huge pillow. She will not burrow because the top cover is so heavy. On the plus side: the quality is good and it's made in America. My opinion is it would be better for a small dog rather than a cat.
2,Not Crazy About Product,"Poorly filled and not durable. The filling in this bed is almost instantly compacted. Disgraceful. After only a month with an 11 lb dog, I had to go to the fabric and buy more filler and fill it myself. I won't order another."
2,Decent movie with horrible dubbing,"A band of Taiwanese rebels fight British army occupiers in order to get the corpse of their leader back. Some decent fights, but the dubbing is so horrible that it completely ruins the film. There is almost no sound other than the dialogue, making it almost unwatchable. To make it worse, the dubbers almost take a ""Kung Faux"" approach and add idiotic and humorless lines that clearly were not from the original movie. Buy at your own risk."
4,us stove 2421,like the looks and the way it heats the house. But it does not damper down very well I had to do some things to get to damper down better.
2,Think Twice on this Stove!,"Rustic/Classic looking stove.Assembly is possible if you have some metal working ability, as some of the parts need to be filed to fit, and then re-painted.Instructions aren't very helpful at all, though you will eventually figure it out through trial and error if you are handy.It is LONG... if you are replacing an existing stove, measure the stove area and draw a diagram of how this will fit. Mine doesn't, as it is on a raised brick platform. Since there are no diagrams on the outside of the box, you should measure the floor model at TSC to decide if it will fit.I haven't fired it up yet, so I cannot comment on the performance, though the metal to metal part fit has me concerned that it will smoke at the seams."
3,Just being naked isn't art.,"'Art' requires more than just documenting naked people worldwide. Therefore, this is more of a documentary rather than a form of artistic expression. The photographer makes it clear in one scene where he doesn't think his pictures are artsy but just documenting a happening. And also that there are certainly other people who have already done a similar thing. But if you want to see how people look in other countries without their body being retouched, then this film is for you.If you're going to claim your work is 'art', be sure to put something of your heart into it first."
2,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,I found this book extremely difficult to understand. In this book the Author uses victorian style english. Victorian English is very difficult to understand due to the verb usage.
4,Love this book BUT....,"Fantastic book, so sweet my son & I both love it! The text couldn't be more charming but the music is incredibly loud -- how a child can focus on the book and the words with the VERY loud music and all the lights is beyond me, it was terribly distracting. I immediately took the battery out and now we love this book even more!"
5,"Great book, but heads up non-believers!","We love this book. The pictures are great and the rhyming is fun. The only thing I wish I could change is the last line, ""but most of all what you are is God's greatest gift of love"". Works great if you are a religious family, but of course there's a large population out there that isn't and they might not realize this book ends with that line since the book appears to be secular."
5,Fun to read and soothing to my baby's ears!,"We've been reading to my 5-month old son since he was born and ""You're My Little Love Bug"" is by far his favorite! He is mesmerized by the beautiful music and reading the words in rhythm with the tune makes it fun to read. I had to buy a second copy since it's such a hit with my mother-in-law...she ""stole"" our copy and I needed one for our house! :) I highly recommend this book, it's a beautiful keepsake that will be cherished by both child and parent."
3,A Girl Thing review,"I like A GirlThing. It has four mini storys about love and life and family. Don't worry each story is about 50 minutes, so you get real complete storys. I always feel a movie is good as long as it has a good story line and gives it enough time to tell the story. It's worth wathing."
2,uncc car mats,"ok, so it took these a while to get in, a lot longer than I wanted. They are car mats, so i figured they'll be fine no matter what. I was cleaning my car and found that these things are falling apart after only 1 month. The fiber comes off the mat just by running your hand across it."
5,"This No Longer sold CD is uplifting, full of hooks and a classic","Back in the pre I-tunes days, there were a few albums that sold well, not based on one or two songs, but the entire compilation. This CD is full of easy going melodies with meaningful lyrics and feel good hooks and harmonies. I lived in Utah in the early 90s when I was stationed at an Air Force Base, and one of the best independent radio stations in the nation would regularly play their songs. ""Everyone needs love"" was a very well written song of self discovery and upbeat outlooks. I highly recommend this if you can get a hold of a copy."
5,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT","This album is another version of Common Threads Live (also available on Amazon.com as well as gigrecords.com home of Miles Hunt) This CD has different art work but the songs are the same.My sugestion BUY IT because its great. Miles (accompanied by Malcolm Treece) take the listener through a tour of acoustic versions of some Wonder Stuff and Vent 414 AS WELL AS a great song called Manna From Heaven ( which can be found on the new Miles Hunt Album ""Hairy on the Inside"" at his live shows and at gigrecords) THis is an amazing CD and I guarantee if your a Wonder Stuff or Vent 414 fan who hasn't heard any new acoustic stuff for miles or a new fan YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
5,Comfort.,"Bella tShirts have a great color selection, they fit nice and best bargain for the price without sacrificing quality."
3,NIKON BINOCULAR,"efficient & well built though a little heavygreat price (thanks to the 1,48 $ for one euro)"
5,A remarkable novel!,"A must read if one wishes to try to grasp the historical intricacies and animosity of Christian and Palestinian relations. Told through a unique narration style, this book is a must read for anyone interested in Middle East relations without the typical watered-down bias of western corporatism. A truly wonderful novel."
1,Sitt Marie-Rose is an AWFUL book!,"I did not enjoy this book whatsoever. I was terrible. DO NOT waste your money on it!! Reading this book was a waste of time. I'm neither a Christian nor Palestinian; I'm not saying this book was awful because I was offended by it (as some might be). Very objectively, I judge that this is poor, horrible, boring literature...A waste of time and money. If I could I would not give it a star at all. One star is more than it deserves!"
5,Good. And that's better than most.,"""I Get The Papers"" is a classic. A top ten rap song of all time. Granted, it's nothing ground breaking, but this is a song that many a rappers have attempted, and failed, to make. Milk D has a whole lot of average machismo lyrics, but his MC Lyte-voice and clean delivery sell it.While there may be some tracks to skip, there are still 3 or 4 absolute bangers. Heavy bass and high pitched vocals. A very nice combo."
3,Booker Prize Winner??,"Big disappointment - I enjoyed the author latest book Parrott & Olivier in America and wanted to read more of his work and as this had won the Booker Prize I thought it would be even better - I grew up in Sydney, Australia and so my interest was probably higher than someone unfamiliar with the location of the story - I think a lot of the story would be very boring to ""non-Australians"" - Plot took forever to get to Australia where the ""core of the book"" takes place - and the ending ,for me, was just - well - wierd. Only the author's great writing kept me reading this book."
2,Oscar and Lucinda,Literary fiction is sometimes very tedious for me to read. This is one of them. It takes 300 pages for Oscar to Meet Lucinda. By that time you know what both thier parents ate for breakfast and what the dog's name was and what their neighbors wore to church. But so what?I found the book slow and over detailed.Detail is something Carey is best at.I found the book slow and not that interesting.
5,Wonderful and terrifying exploration of the nature of love.,"With sharply etched characters and a sweeping, epic scope, Oscar and Lucinda richly deserves all of the praise with which it has been blessed."
4,"A totally original classic, but not perfect","""Puta's Fever"" is the only Mano Negra release in USA, and one of the first things that I noticed upon listening was the strange production. Many songs sound like they were recorded live in a concert hall without an audience. But what is the music like? Imagine Latin polkas on methamphetamines with a little surf-guitar added on top. A whole pile of styles and languages are utilized (English, French, Spanish, and even Farsi) and the only real reason I don't give it five stars is that the newest album, ""Casa Babylon"", is near perfect and far superior. Still, with songs like ""Pas Assez de Toi"" and ""Guayaquil City"", ""Puta's Fever"" is one of the most interesting albums I have ever heard, even with its below-par production. Note: the European release contains two extra songs, but they are nothing to worry about."
1,does not play and no customer support,"I bought a Soul DMP206b audiobook player on October 9th, 2005. It worked quite well for the first month then began to intermittently stop playing in the middle of a disk. When I would try to start it again, the display would indicate there was no disk (and of course there was.) This happened mostly when I was walking with it but then it began to happen when it was stable, on a table or bed and occurred with increasing frequency. Finally, on January 30th, I sent an email to the support address provided for the player asking about the problem and to date (March 1st) have received no reply at all. I have, for all practical purposes, not been able to use it for the last month and have resorted to an old cassette player. I am extremely disappointed. It was a $149.99 purchase, plus the additional a family member paid to get the adapter and earphones. Money poorly spent in my opinion."
1,worked for a short time and stopped,"I also had problems with the machine, After a couple of months of using it when I walk, the player stopped recognizing that there was a disc in the player and if I can get the player to see a disc I get static on it. I am also very disapointed."
2,fatal mistake,"This book makes a fatal mistake. It discusses Wang Shuo's novella ANIMAL VICIOUS and Jian Wen's film adaption at the same time. Of course, it is OK. However, the writer seems to be so confused herself that she keeps turning to the film version when she is supposed to discuss the original novella. It is OK too. But in the bibliography of the book, there is only the entry for the novella, but none for the movie. In other words, the author seems to imply (and it seems that she believes so) that the film and the novella are the same text. The conflation of the film and the novella is a symptom of the scholar's absent-mindedness. It is not professional. Also, I agree with the other reader: this book is surprisingly heterosexual-centered. Ignorance of any gay presence in Chinese lit at large is shocking."
4,Haunting,"While it's true that the quality of this tape could be better, the performances are very good and the music is hauntingly romantic and absolutely unforgettable."
1,Terrible movie,Thismovie was horrible! to sad to watch. i already gave my copy away. I have no desire to watch it again. a MAJOR let down to because i am a huge Colin Firth fan.
4,Great movie. Loved Firth. He is good in any movie.,My wife is Irish. Love the videos. We like good Clean shows. Camille and Colin Firth were great.We need more actors like this.
1,disappointed,I love Colin Firth so I bought this movie but was very disappointed in this movie. Music was bad because it is an old movie so I kind of expected that but the acting was sub-par also.
1,I sent this DVD back,"I love English romance movies, so I took a chance and ordered Camille. I did'nt like this drama because all the main actress did all through the movie was sleep with different men who could give her money or take care of her financially so she could move up in the world. I thought this a vulgar movie with no respect for the other person. I didn't want this movie in my collection, so I sent it back."
4,Funniest ever...,"Undoubtedly one of the funniest Hindi films of all time, giving a nostalgic look at young and urbane 70s Bombay. Palekar is brilliant as the quintessential idiot in love with Vidya Sinha, but unable to express his love for her. Asrani is an excellent rival, sliming his way into the girl's heart. But there's a trump card - up in the hills is a learned oldie Ashok Kumar who has a devious plan of action in mind - to give Palekar the one-up on Asrani. Few have seen this film, and I'm yet to come across anyone who disputes that this rates as one of the best comedies to ever come out on the Indian silver screen."
1,Must read kanji,You need to be able to read Chinese characters to use this. Could be a bi-lingual dictionary if it also included Roman-letter translation.
2,Should have bought a different one.,"Pros: Worked for about a few years, Did make popcornCons: Rusted, thin metal, still burnt on some popcorn due to thin metal, Handle was flimsy, Sometimes the lid was difficult to remove.Overall: Not the best popcorn maker."
4,You've Got to Read This!,"I found this book very entertaining. None of the works that my professor assigned us to read were boring, infact they actually made me want to read more; which says a lot considering I am a very picky reader."
2,Not Worth the Money,"Ever since I got my TomTom I have had a problem with the mount every time I used it at some point in the trip it crashes down and gets banged up. My whole family has TomTom's and none of them have ever had this problem so I thought I may have gotten a defective mount so when my charger broke (for the second time, most likely from crashing down too many times!)I decided to spring for the charger and mount bundle, which turned out to be a totally rip because it did the same thing as my old one. I wish I would have just bought the charger I could have saved myself like $25 bucks."
4,SO GOOD!!,This is the best chocolate you will ever eat.Everyone needs to try just one box and you will buy more.It would make a great gift for a beach wedding too.
3,Interesting Early Cop Show But Dated,"I had high hopes for this series after reading the reviews and knowing that John Thaw starred. However, I found it to be too dated to be really interesting now and the macho atmosphere a bit juvenile. I can imagine it was quite a sensation when it first appeared but cop shows, whether character or action driven and whether about upper crust characters or street denizens, have come a long way since then. Also, the central character as a maverick officer/detective has also been done a lot and done better since that time. Inspectors Morse, Frost, Lynley, and others like Vincent, DaVinci, Barnaby, the Sandbaggers, etc. have all portrayed the smart cop who doesn't like to follow the rules and I found most of those to be better done and more engrossing than The Sweeney."
3,Needs velcro or something to secure,"This looks great when you put it on. But it needs velcro or something to secure it. I wore these twice, and secured them well under my bra straps. I am 63 years old, and not slender. There was not enough exertion to make these come loose. But both times I wore them, one of them fell out onto the floor at the most embarrassing time. Looked silly..."
3,Good when there is not any surrounding noise,"This unit has good sound and supports enhanced features like voice dial and redial last number. The sound quality (in and out) are good when in a quiet environment, like driving or in an office. If walking outside on a nice day you will still create too much noise for the other party to hear you, which is also the case if there is a small breeze or it is windy. The range is less than advertised unless you are in direct sight of your phone or other Bluetooth device. For example, I get noise if the phone is in my right hip pocket and the Jabra headset is on my right ear. However, I do like the way it fits and the sound I receive is good. Overall I like it and do use it often. I do wish they used a univeral power supply so that I would not have to take theirs with my on my trips."
2,Not of good quality,"The material is soft, however it lost it's original texture soon after one wash. You get what you pay."
4,foodsaver bags,they came in good time and they were excatly what I ordered...no problems here...will go thru 12 of those rolls pretty quick...thanks...c
3,Pretty Good,"I got this CD used, and as a long term fan of the Prince and the Revolution days, I thought it was worth the price.Someone compared this to Sheryl Crow. No doubt, and good call. It has that, er...swingy feeling to it? Perhaps that's not the best word, but its not a bad thing at all.It's kinda funky at times, and kinda jazzy at times and I would call it alternative because it would never get commercial airplay (which is often no indication of a CD's qualities.) I would personally have to be in the right mood to really appreciate its style, but that's not a knock on this CD by any means."
3,eerie,"Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noone, a radio personality, who is going through a ""time-out"" from his lover. He's been asked to review a book from a young man, with health problems, who happens to be Gabriel's biggest fan. The book is a memoir of a childhood filled with abuses and other strange incidents.Within a short amount of time, Gabriel becomes fond of this fan, even though they've only communicated via telephone. That is, until one day, his estranged lover suggested that the fan may not be who he claims to be. Irked by the suggestion, Gabriel decides to head out and investigate. This is where things become eerie because things are just not what they seem to be.*The Night Listener* moves somewhat slow but I do understand that it was necessary to build suspense. Yet, the result that it produced wasn't as creepy as it could have been. Overall, good but just don't expect it to be mind-blowing like *Sixth Sense* or *The Others*."
4,Good acting but could have been written a little better,"Overall this was a good psychological thriller. Toni Collette shines as the creepy, mentally ill ""Donna."" Her character ranges from eccentric to downright scary. Robin Williams also turns in a solid performance...not his best but still quite good. However, I still felt like something was missing. The movie goes by at a quick pace, almost too quick. I think they could have gone more in depth with some of the scenes, themes, and secondary characters. But the movie kept my interest throughout. I was really anxious to see how it ended."
1,Miscast,"Robin Williams is horribly miscast in this film, and there are a number of actors who could have done the role and the film a lot of good. All of his strengths are under wraps, his weaknesses as an actor (he's just grim in serious drama, which is boring) up front. The big subtext in the story is not dealt with in either his performance or the film (is his fascination with a young teenager sexual?), leaving you with the impression it is (you get the feeling the producers felt no one would associate Williams with pedophilia so they just ignored it). This has to be the last thing they intended. There will hopefully be a drama that uses Williams in a way that releases his comic energies some day. The rest of the cast - particularly Toni Collette - is wonderful but mostly underused. This is a prime example of A List miscasting, almost up there with Whoopi Goldberg in ""Fatal Beauty"". It could have been interesting."
2,Advertising for this movie is nothing more than bait and switch..,"The movies trailers make this look like a good movie, full of suspense and thrills. NOT! The only good thing about this movie are the actors, love Robin, love Sandra and the others but the bad thing is the script they gave them. And please don't even compare this to Alfred Hitchcock, that man was a genius with movies, this movie falls way short of that. It really is a shame, I think they could have done a lot more with this movie to turn it into something good."
3,Missed the Mark,"This was a fantastic book, one of those you can't stop reading until the end. The movie fell short. It seems rather miscast (especially Robin Williams) and lacked the taut suspense and uneasiness of the book. This film takes a more detached perspective that ultimately disappoints if you have read the book. It's not a bad movie, only it doesn't approach the thrill of the book."
2,Ok....kind of.,It kind of worked but it was a paint to mount on my power chair. Probably works well on a standard wheel chair tho.
5,Much more than a time travel novel!,"Gib realizes that the odd machine he was given by a strange old man may hold the key to undoing the most devastating day of his life. He quickly learns, however, that there are consequences for every single action, however insignificant it may seem, and that trifling with such power is a huge responsibility. Who WAS that old man, and why did he seem to have such an interest in Gib and his family?Etchemendy has done a brilliant job of leading the reader to consider some questions even larger than, ""What would you do if you could travel across time,"" or ""If you could change an event from the past, what would it be?"""
4,"Can get a bit dull, but well worth a listen.","I always seem to discover something new each time I put one of these discs in. Repetitive, mathematical, and frenetic. Great background music.If I had a gripe it would be that after a while, this type of minimalist music gets a little monotonous. I haven't yet been able to make it through all 12 parts without taking a break.If you like this CD set, I'd recommend ""The Continuing Story Of Counterpoint"" by David Borden. It has a bit more variety."
3,"12 parts, 12 long parts","It takes a person with stamina to be able to listen to Music in 12 Parts in one or several sittings. I am not a musician so I can only peripherally enjoy the musicianship. Not much changes in many of these long pieces, each averaging about 17 minutes. It IS minimal in that regard, which doesn't bother me. It's just that so many of the pieces here are not pleasant to the ear.Being a Glass fan, I can, however, highly recommend parts 1 and 2. Part one is what Philip Glass intended as ""Music in 12 Parts"" until he played it for someone and they said ""great...how do the other 11 sound?"" which intrigued him enough to continue with 11 more parts.Edit: After my first fairly critical review and after a couple years in which I occasionally play this music, I must admit that Music in 12 Parts has grown on me. Parts 5,6,8 now stand out. I think I finally ""get"" it, though, hands down, Part 1 is the most beautiful piece on this album."
3,It didn't really hold my 2nd generation nano very well,didn't really hold my 2nd generation nano very well
4,4 1/2 star winner,"This prequel to the Swagger saga hits a home run.Earl Swagger is a decorated veteran returning home from Iwo Jima, where he received the medal of honor. Owney Maddox is the gangster that runs the books, brothels, and casinos at Hot Springs, which in 1946, is a city of wide corruption and notoriety, attracting the rich and famous. A Mr. Becker, who is the new prosecuting attorney, hires Swagger to train a group of men to clean up the town. Earl Swagger does not let his impending fatherhood get in the way as he deals with evils and betrayals and a rising body count.I enjoyed this book as much as his previous books. The writing jumps out at you like your at a movie watching it all unfold. The history of Hot Springs (though here made more violent, because afterall, its a Swagger novel) was quite interesting. This is a highly action packed novel. Good vs evil, cops vs gangsters. Of course 'Bugsy' makes his appearances also.Highly recommended"
4,Would Make a Good Movie!,"Not as good as Point of Impact, but still a very good read and gets better as it motors along. Would make a good movie!"
2,not much plot or characters,"Although I enjoyed the ""Bob the Nailers"" books, this story of Bob's dad Earl was fairly flat and did not develope other characters well. I was disappointed and hope he does not plan to go back even farther and do Bob's grandpa -- it is getting to be a soap opera. Instead he should start a new character or maybe have Bob's daughter go to Dessert Storm if he has to keep it in the family."
2,Not So Good,"I was disappointed with the sticks, for 2 reasons.1--- the vertical angle of handle to the blade is lower than usual... placing the handle lower off the floor than normal. This made the sticks undesireable to all of my teenagers, the age group I bought this length of stick for.**If you want to use a long stick that is angled for use by tiny tots, then hey... this stick is for you.2--- I know teenagers are hard on floor hockey sticks... but these broke quicker than they should. They plastic is a bit too brittle. I also speculate that the goofy angle of the blade causes any slap of the stick to stress the blade more than it should.On the pros... the shorter-handled goal sticks were nice.I will not buy these again."
5,Buy the rolls instead of individual bags,"Just like others that posted reviews on this item, I agree that buying the rolls is much, much better than purchasing the individual bags. You are able to cut the bag to your liking and not be wasteful. I don't see myself ever buying the individual bags again."
2,Verbose,"Front Page 2002: A beginner's guide - does a decent job of teaching you Frontpage, but it is overly simplistic. It takes forever to learn core tasks. The main fault I found with the book is that it is NOT concise! In a manual of this type, you want the author to get to the key points, efficiently communicate what you need to know, and move on. This book fails in this regard. That said, to it's credit, if you have the time, it does eventually get around to explaining how to use front page."
5,"Applause Kirupa,,,","Kirupa Has done it again, Thanks for the wonderful book, its well worth it, I have used FrontPage for some time and I am always trying to fiqure out the how to's, this book has a lot of great information that will help everyone..This is a very well designed, well planned book to add to any collection.Great JobWebMasterz5"
5,Long time ZAO fan,Album has everything you need to hear to get a good gist of how ZAO has formed. The last 3 demo songs do not have Dan Weyandt on them. They were recorded when Dan had left the band and Cory Darst took over for like 6 months. Anyway great band Great CD. Thank God Jesse is no longer with them. New CD is probably one of the best ones!
5,Amazing,"Zao puts it all together and makes a truly incredable CD. I wouldn't have changed a thing if I were putting it together myself. I only found one thing to be off. The vocals in The song ""The Icarius Complex"" didn't sound like Dan's they sounded all over the place like a knock off of the real thing."
2,Disappointing,"After I discovered 1995's Skarmageddon,lost it,rebought it,I was slobbering in anticipation with my newfound ability to buy any ska I wanted without running my poor little 1993 Nissan Sentra into the ground,driving all around the midwest.(Yup,I stopped being chicken of buying online)After you pop this cd in you will be filled with a resounding, ""Oh this is just okay"" feeling that you get when you buy a full album of somebody you only like two songs of,like,say..The Exceptions. A few standouts that have that magical weirdness I crave in ska,like ""The Irish Singer of Albee Square"" come to mind,but overall this is a letdown. Skip right from Skarmageddon one and buy number Three,which is totally,magically awesome."
2,too delicate,"Bodum double wall is to delicate for espresso--- I have two broken ---- one on bottom and one on lip-----DO NOT BUY THIS!!! unless you can guard it----I have two more that I guess will break --- You just cant be that careful ---Certainly Bodum knows the problem and is probably re-casting as I write or worse yet getting rid of these and hoping the public will just say "" oh well my mistake"""
5,PERFECT,"I first received a copy of this album on cassette from a friend in Pelotas-RS, Brasil and immediately fell in love with the music. Gilberto and Caetano, two literal legends, are just worth buying this CD. Favorite track has to be Cinema Novo. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
5,"On my ""top ten"" movie list","Exceptional cast, brilliant performances, and accurate history---forgiving some accommodation of drama. I have watched this in VHS several times and am fascinated by the glimpse of humanity it gives. Characters so riveting Shakespeare would be impressed. Several of my friends have also purchased this as well. HBO is building a reputation for outstanding historical drama."
4,ICY COLD,"Brrrrrrr....wear a warm coat while watching this one. The masterful portrayal of evil this calculated, this methodical, this bureaucratic, this systematic will make your blood run cold."
5,"Overpriced, but none better","All Tilia's products are overpriced, but I have not seen a better vacuum sealer on the market. My neighbor across the street bought a Rival, and after using that for a week and then trying mine, return the Rival and traded up to a Tilia. The product has a powerful vacuum and is well-designed. Tilia's profit-business model depends on you buying accessories and bags, and charging you a premium too. Well, the accessories are very well made, I'll say that. As far as the bags go, don't buy them, you are paying for convenience. Buy the rolls. Even better, buy the rolls made by Rival as they work just as well, are thicker, and much cheaper!"
2,Recurrent Problem,"I'm amazed so many people find no problem with this product -- for me it has been nothing but trouble. When it works, it works well; unfortunately, it mostly doesn't work. The common failing is that after producing a vacuum, the heat sealer fails to activate. I have sent the product back on two occasions because of this and received back a repaired product on the first occasion and what I presume was a new replacement the second time. On each occasion the device worked for a period of time and then re-developed the same problem. I think I'll try an alternative brand this time around."
3,PLEASE BE ADVISED!!!!!!,"I recently purchased two 12"" PYLE-PRO speakers, while I clearly understand their limitations, I was very disappointed to notice that they began or will begin to ""SMOKE"" if pushed close to their limits. This caught me off guard as I would not have expected this at all from these 800 watt speakers. Knowing this, made me feel that while I was looking for a lower price speaker, it reflected in the quality of this product as well."
4,Very good,"The idea of having a selection of nothing but songs to the words of Goethe is excellent.We are not dealing with a rehash of ""classical favourites"" here.I agree with Grady Harp on just about everything except the rating.I'll recommend this record but I'd give this 4 starsprecisely because Dawn Upshaw had not yet quite blossomed.It's the feeling that while it's all very pretty there is something missing at times(although the very last song, Das Veilchen, is perfect) that's hard to pin downwhich lowered my score, when I compare this to say Irmgard Seefried."
3,Something strange here,"The version I purchased (used) is only 44 minutes long and is missing both the Screwy Squirrel and Droopy cartoons. I'm desparately seeking Screwy Squirrel, so I guess I'll have to investigate this inconsistency."
1,This is one AWFUL movie!,"Liking muscle cars and girls in bikinis, and bolstered by all the glowing reviews, I decided to take a chance on this DVD. I will regret it my entire natural life. This movie is AWFUL! There is no plot, the girls can't act, the photography will give you a headache with all it's jump cuts, and Corey Feldman can't dance. I would give it NO stars if that was possible.This stinker is going to wind up on a dealers table at our movie con next September. I cannot for the life of me understand how it rated 4 1/2 stars, unless the cast and crew are doing the ratings."
4,F@#K YOU G-MART!!!!,"JUST AS THE COVER SAYS...POINTLESSLY DEPRAVED!! IF YOU LOVED CHEEZ-BALL FLICKS WITH BAD ACTING AND PURE NONSENSE LIKE PLAN 9 OR AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON, THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. AFTER SEEING THAT THE CAST WAS MADE UP OF MEMBERS FROM BANDS LIKE DEAD KENNEDYS, TOOL, AND RAMONES, I KNEW THE MOVIE HAD TO BE INSANE, AND THAT IT WAS!!"
4,well done movie,"I'm very interested in the mafia and I love mafia moovies. I've seen many and this isn't one of my favorites, yet it is worth it. It was a good movie, very well done and mostly intriguing. I think most people would enjoy this movie and I would recommend it."
1,A Mean-spirited film,"""The Godfather"" has an ugly consciousness and a mean spirit. I see no justification for it, thoroughly disliked it, and have tried to forget it."
4,The godfather,we couldnt find it on netflix. we enjoyed watching it. the quality of the streaming was excellent so we will definitely use it again.
5,A Mafia must,The Godfather blows every other mafia film away. MarlonBrando as Don Vito Corleone was flawless. I really enjoyed his acting. Personally I thought Al Pacino as Michael seemed more of the fit in the mafia than James Caan did as Sonny. Throughout the movie it just seemed to me that Michael more was the part of a mafia player than Sonny was. I do recommend this movie to any mafia film buff.
4,Can't refuse this item,It is a classic. The quality was alright for a 50 year old movie. If I had the time I'd watch it again.
3,an acting retrospect,poor acting by al pacino and robert duvall spoil an otherwise very good 6 or so hours of film entertainment. [I and II; fogettabout III].
3,Better Get the Collection,"So many reviews rate the film itself which we already know is a classic, but few give any comments on the quality of the DVD. The Paramount Widescreen Collection of this film is indeed a very bad transfer which becomes quite evident in the first scene which is almost incomprehensible because it is so dark as to render the subtle performance of Brando unviewable. On my DVD I couldn't even access the bonus track with the commentary. Fortunately I only spent $15 for it, but it really fueled my desire to see the collection which everyone raves about, eventhough I could care less for GF III."
5,The Icon of Mafia Films,"Francis Ford Coppola's (Apocalypse Now) 1972 film on the evolution of the Corleone crime family from its roots in Sicily to its new life in America based on the novel by Mario Puzo. A film rich in various themes about family, society, immigrants, and the American dream; brought to life by the brilliant directing skills of Coppola and an all-star cast.Al Pacino is becoming a man and is approached by his father Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) with an offer he can't refuse: an offer for him to be the new Don in charge of the family business. At first hesitant, Pacino's character soon learns all the ins and outs of running an organized crime syndicate but the price is high. Family betrayals and loss of friends are but a few of the dramatic plot twists in this great film.There have been very few mob films with such a multi-layered theme as this one. This is truly a masterpiece of cinema that should be in everyone's collection."
5,Warning!,"Do not attempt to listen to De Stijl if you don't want the most upbeat, contagious boogie-woogie tune in your head to make you dance for the rest of the week. Basso ostinato, canon, fugue, formal structure, Stravinski-influence--formal musical analysis could be put to use here, but anyone who thinks they've heard ""classical"" music before and listens to this piece will have to rethink some things."
4,Portraits of Relationships,"Sarah Stonich writes with sensitivity and poise of the reflections of a dying woman on her life and relationships. She examines the theme of fidelity in marriage and the strength of friendship. As the book progresses windows of insight are opened into the world of the narrator, which keep you turning the pages till the very end. I found this book fascinating, well written and thought provoking. I hope this first novel is not the last we hear from Sarah Stonich."
3,Graveside Memories,"These Granite Islands captures poignant reflections of a ninety-nine-year-old woman, Isobel, as she recalls moments in 1936 of her friendship with a mentally ill tourist, Cathryn, caught in an adulterous relationship. The third person narrator concentrates on Isobel but, occasionally, moves to Thomas, Isobel's only survivng child, as he keeps a bedside watch over his dying mother. The theme of entrapment is strong, and the environment of death, past and imminent, produces a heavy shroud over the memories. I appreciate the descriptions of the Minnesota lake region and the originality of outlook but consider the novel too long for relaxed reading."
3,Not easy to use for baked goods and sauces,"I bought this foodsaver because I bake cookies and send them through the mail. On first try the vacuum seal did a great job of removing the air but it also removed the air from the cookies. So I ended up with some really compressed cookies! I read the troubleshooting section to learn that I had to freeze the cookies before sealing them in order to retain its shape. It also mentioned that sauces had to be frozen before sealing them in the pouches. So while I had planned to make a lot of pesto sauce to freeze for the winter months, I think I'll just use it for cookies because of the extra effort required."
3,Not the biggest hit!!,"My dog didn't eat the biscotti at first but then warmed up to it. Given a choice of three treats, the biscotti ranked last!"
2,Not a normal atlas.,"Normally, atlases give you a tiny overview of the whole area and then zoom in on the metro areas and places of interest to travellers. This one has no zoomed in areas. Every page is at a broad overview magnification, so it's tough to see even major highways and roads in the metro areas. Not good if you are new to the area!"
4,"A good map, but with less detail than other state maps","The map is pretty good, but it does not have the level of detail that I have seen in Delorme guides for other states."
4,Comprehensive but no macro-views!,"We'll be using this atlas for an RV trip. Although we haven't yet done the trip, the maps look like what we need (detailed, topographic, forest/side roads). I will say that it's missing decent regional and statewide views. TheBenchmark California Road & Recreation Atlas, Fifth Edition (Benchmark Road & Recreation Atlas)series does an excellent job of panning the state, and then drilling down. The Gazetteer series just has the drill-down. Makes it tough when you want to get a macro-view of your route."
2,Fun Game With Some Major Problems,"This game was really designed more for a console than a hand held. The controls are difficult to use. Riding the horse is tough with the hand held controls. Aiming can also be an issue, especially when you need to do it quickly against moving targets. I love everything else about this game but the controls really make it so frustrating that ultimately it ruins the game. Get this game on a console instead of a hand held."
1,Thriller Checklist,"Plot -- Formulaic and improbable, a page turner nonetheless. In fact, I felt like I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.Writing -- Copy and paste at it's best, all flights are delayed by an hour, and all characters like soda pop.Editing -- No editing in evidence. This novel reads like a rough draft re-typed overnight after drinking and before an early morning deadline -- re-typed and never re-read before going to press."
1,DO NOT buy/read this GARBAGE,"I honestly don't know how this book has some five star reviews, definitely the author writes these pathetic and untruthful reviews. This book is poorly written, I can't believe it was even published!!! What a waste of time and money!!!! I assure you, you will stop reading after twenty pages, the paper of this book would be better used for craft projects or for picking up your pet's waste.I was curious to know more about who could write something this bad and I found out more than I anticipated about the ""writer"" please copy and paste this on your web browser and then decide for yourself if it's worthy to give this guy a penny out of your pocket...[...]This man and this book are both sad and disappointing!"
4,Strong moodsetter that stays in the background.,"I picked this album up by accident at the library. At first, it sounded strange, like X-Files music before something terrible occurs...But the more I listened to it, the more I enjoyed it. It sounds sweet, ominous, and lamenting all at the same time. Perfect for those late nights."
2,The Ultimate Bottom-Feeder?,"The victims hadn't even turned cold in the Jeffco morgue when Dr. Mintle began ""mining"" the killing fields of Columbine. Most of what we ""knew"" back then is now known to be false, and that discredits the book (both in terms of shoddy research and its conclusion) in its entirety. This book took three or four weeks to get to market ... and it shows.The funniest part of the book was the end, where she stumbled around the edges of ""generational curses."" Any semblance of professional clinical analysis was at that point obliterated."
4,Great Item,"This is a great item and works well. 4 Stars only because the handle of the item was cracked in two places. Other than that, great! Thank you"
2,"It's ""JUST"" an okay item.",I thought the pieces would be heavier. They are made of really thin plastic that is going to be easy for my 6yo to break.Love the piece's allowed movement on each one though. Maybe I'll be able to play one day too! :)
2,learning chess,Simple yet great way to learn chess. Christmas gift for grandson and he loves it. Prompt shipment by seller and exactly as described.
2,"you get what you pay for, i guess","This looked like the pieces would be solid heavy quality pieces.They are not. They are hollow plastic.And I should have paid attention to the picture. The directionsfor the move each piece can make are on the side facing you for theblack, but on the side facing the black player for the white. Does thatmake sense? The directions are on the back side of the white.I am disappointed is the quality and common sense of the makingof this chess teaching game."
1,Check System Requirements Elsewhere!,"I could hardly wait for this game to arrive, only to find out that my computer doesn't meet the system requirements (which were not laid out here on Amazon). The game does NOT play with an Intel Chipset, despite having 3D graphics abilities. How frustrating.I'll wind up passing this along to a friend whose computer - although much older than mine - has the required video card."
3,Mommy Bear 1,"The bear was a great idea, but the heartbeat in this bear only lasted for about 40 seconds. The package said it would last 40 minutes. I bought another bear which did last 40 min. or longer."
1,Womb bear,I bought this for my 5 week old twin boys hoping it would help them sleep but it didn't help either one.
2,Doesn't do what the box says it does,This thing didn't soothe my crying infant or make her feel like she was still in the womb. I think all these things are gimmicks. I handed this bear down to a friend and she said her baby laughed at the bear sounds. I guess that's better than crying.
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter just is calm with this bear. She is a new born and had it from day one now she is two months and still sleeps with it ! All mom's need this !
3,Great...at first,"I love the womb sounds bear, however, after only using it for a short time the womb sound gadget is making a loud high pitched hum??? I have not checked the batts yet or what kind to replace...thought it would last a lot longer than that!!"
1,like a carnival toy,Very unhappy with the quality of this bear. Every time it is touched fur comes off in clumps. The auto off function does not work. The eyes are not safe for babies and could be pulled off. This item is not safe for to have around a baby!
3,Happy Camper,"Very soft and great for play for a 3 year old. Also, it;s great to travel with not to big."
2,No wonder they're B-sides!,"Collectables has released so many of Williams' terrific albums that this latest entry should not be on the top of your must-have list. There is a reason these selections were B-sides or rare. The song selections are poor and his covers of 70s classics, such as ""He's My Brother,"" are uninspiring and shrill; many songs find Williams singing at the top of his vocal range. The disc gets off to a bad start with the inclusion of two Kay Thompson songs from the 1940s! More than half of the 23 tracks come from Williams 1970s output."
4,clippers,"Have not gotten to use the clippers, that I purchased for a Christmas gift, yet, but have used the same model in the past and was very pleased with the performance."
3,Broken seal,"I have had my Vac 300 for about 1-1/2 years and never had a problem with it until just this past month. Now the left side of the sealing strip will not seal and I did not realize that until days later when I went back into the freezer. My brother swears by this product but has purchased a more expensive unit. I plan to also ""upgrade"" to a better level because when it works, you can't beat it, and once you get used to it, you can't be without it!"
2,works for lest than a year,bought last year worked wonderful for 10 months and then came around to seal some bags and would not seal. vacuum works but will not work sealing anything. looking for a new one but will not buy another tilia and will buy more along a professional sealer
2,"great when new, died too soon.","I really like the concept of this machine. I use it sporadically, mostly to store grain, flour, etc. However, while it worked fine initially it progressively has had more and more trouble pulling enough of a vacuum to seal (the sealing part of the machine is only activated when the vacuum reaches a certain point). Now it is totally useless. The rubber seals look to be in good condition and I don't recall any trauma that occurred, such as liquid being sucked into the machine, etc. I don't think that I even used the machine to seal more than 50 bags before it stopped working. What a disappointment!"
2,Welcome to the Failed 2004 Kerry Wins Movie,"This movie was an attempt by ""Air America"" to document the win in 2004 by John Kerry, yet something went wrong... he Lost.Air America thought how cool would it be to launch a radio network to get John Kerry elected, show it to the world and take some credit for the win and make lots of money for a group of people who should never be allowed near politics.This movie has the best ending of any movie made about politics... the Air America crowd with heads buried in hands, crying and lamenting... their guy got beat."
3,Neutral rating.,"Actually, I would give it 2 and 1/2 stars. But, this system doesn't allow 1/2-star ratings. If you do like screaming metal or speed metal, or nu-metal, then this would be an album for you to buy.If you do not like speed metal, etc., then this would not be a CD for you to buy.I'm neutral to this one. I've been around the big hair bands of the '80s and the rock bands of that time and I am a bit more familiar with that style than the sounds of this artist. It does take a bit of getting used to their sound and screams in the various songs on this album. Perhaps I will reconsider Disciple in the future. But, for now, I will give it a neutral ""**1/2""."
3,Well-done movie but history lite,"Remember the old lite beer commercials?""Tastes Great! Less filling!""Beautiful acting and all the ingredients.However: Truthfully boring, though I enjoyed it as a history buff. It's like a short story.The threat to Christian civilization posed by Hitler then is very like the one posed by the Liberal Leftists today.Sadly, the majority either ""support Hitler"" or ""don't care what he's doing"". Since the threat comes from within, it's almost impossible to defend against it. Students have been brainwashed to ""fight for the enemy"". Democrat politicians wage war on America and it's Constitution, and drain it of all the valuable resources that they can find just so THEY can have power and money. The Hussein Obama family has squandered millions of dollars on frivolous trips at taxpayer expense. What a joke! It's just not a funny one.Evil thrives when good men do nothing."
4,"""Hands across the pond, Sir!"" Smashingly delightful.","Sir Churchhill continues to be denied his fulll measure in history, but this movie helps us understand him better. After all, even the British can be human. The Free World owes very much to this Great Leader, who warned us all of the ""Iron Curtain"" that continues in a different form even today. God Love you, Winnie."
5,brittney murphey.,I loved it I understand it better now u can have life without that jerk. hes just another guy. hopefully she scored better. later wish there could of been a 2 she scores.
1,bad movie ... bad script .. bad acting....,cuando me decidi.. a ver esta pelicula..realmente tenia otras espectativas...no esperaba que sea un clasico..pero me imagine que por lo menos..me iba a entretener...es una pena que Holly Hunter..se haya prestado para esta payasada... una pelicula...con una Britanny Murphy..demasiado tibia y demasiado exagerada...en mi opinion... un guion..extremadamente..aburrido.. y malo....solo llega a ponerse interesante en unos 3 minutos..en la escena del talk show...para luego..terminar siendo mas aburrido de como estaba....no pierdan el tiempo..pagando una entrada en el cine.. ni siquiera piensen en alquilarla...mala pelicula + malas actuaciones + mal guion = the litte black book
5,See this film!,"When I first saw this film on HBO, I tuned in about halfway through it. I was completely unaware that James Miller was killed during production and, for me, his death was all the more shocking as it was sudden.For the longest time I thought this might have been fictitious, but it just goes to show you: you can't write this stuff.This is as real as it gets short of being there yourself."
3,True to their promise,"A group of cats encounter a seagull who has run into an oil slick. The gull is gravely ill and begs the cats to promise to care for the last egg she has laid and to teach the baby gull to fly. The cats promise.It is more difficult to teach a bird to fly than the cats realized, but they try to remain true to their promise.A 1001 CBYMRBYGU."
5,Damsel in Green,It's a very enjoyable book. I'm glad Harlequin is redistributing Betty Neels' books. She is one of my favorite authors.
2,A world gone berserk,"every seven years , the placid planet of dante's joy becomes a waking nightmare of death,deformity and madness.to escape,the populace has a choice of sleeping - lying drugged in their tomblike houses,or taking the chance - staying awake & going abroad while their world goes berserk... john carmody , a conscienceless exile from earth ,arrogantly chooses to take the chance... this book is a mad sci-fi , lots of crazy things going on all the time , i got tired of it in the middle ..."
3,"Decent first book, some insight into nature.","Jennifer Ackerman's ""Notes from the Shore"" is a decent collection of essays on the Lewes Delaware region, and it's incredible natural beauty. Contrary to a blurb, Ackerman does neglect the human side of things most often. It's all about the birds, the crabs, and other little-known but wonderous creatures. I found some of what she wrote compelling, but it was always a little uneven."
2,Rambling and unmemorable,"Regrettably, during the golden age of Star Trek novels of the 1980s, this was the only one I was unable to finish, having put it down after only 80 pages. The main characters seemed unfocused and poorly drawn, having been overtaken by unnecessary secondary characters. The prose was rambling, with the author taking much too long to get into the meat of the story. A shame, with several shining torches like Diane Duane's ""The Wounded Sky"" having been published around the same time, that this snoozer should slip by the editors. It's should never have made it beyond self-published fanfic."
2,Mary Sue ruins it,"I always like a good ""find the cure"" thriller, and for the most part this book is not too bad. But unfortunately it is weighted down with the very definition of a Mary Sue character, the new doctor. She overpowers the rest of the book with her obnoxiousness and renders it very difficult to read, for me at least.The ""cats are so wonderful"" stuff is also fairly grating; I think this book was written purely for self-gratification, and as such is sort of immune to criticism, but unless you find characters who are Just the Best! And Everyone Likes Them So Much! interesting, and are a cat person, I suggest finding another Star Trek book to read."
5,Good Value at a Good Price,I gave this calculator as a gift. It was exactly what the recipient wanted at an attractive price. The order arrived quickly and safely and was exactly as I hoped when placing the order.
5,Calculator Heaven!,"I admit, I get very attached to items. When my jewel tone battery powered calculator that I've had for probably 20 years (which I bought for $1 at a garage sale) bit the dust, I was not looking forward to getting a replacement. I ordered three of these based upon the reviews and am extremely satisfied! It is not too big, not too small, the buttons are large and easy to use and the read-out is large enough to read without reading glasses. Actually, the whole thing is big enough to use and read without reading glasses. It is a bit larger than a Blackberry, with a slightly curved shape and is comfortable to hold. It is battery powered (which I wanted - solar is not reliable enough in dark rooms). It's easy to use for a technically challenged person like myself. It is a wonderful calculator!! I'm so glad I came to Amazon instead of wasting time at regular stores."
4,THE BEST OF GAINSBOURG WITH JANE,"If you like GAINSBOURG, this record is worth buying because most of the best songs with JANE are there.It includes the funny RACCROCHEZ C'EST UNE ERREUR in which a sex maniac calls a woman and gives her his fantasy talk;the alternate version of the classic JE T'AIME MOI NON PLUS, and the beautifully sad QUOI in which JANE'S charm is at her best.JANE is the most celebrated of the so called GAINSBOURG muses, and she first met SERGE while making the movie LA PISCINE in 1968."
4,Great edition but the French version is better,"For those who haven't had the opportunity of comparing the Criterion edition with the 2-disc French edition, they might like to know that the extra contents are a bit different.Ultimately, I believe the French edition wins out in terms of its packaging and the design of the chapters' menu, as well as the high visual resolution.Nevertheless, the graphic designers at Criterion should be commended on their superb design of the booklet & cover. This is top notch design & typography."
4,The essence of Colombia,I very much liked this book for several reasons. It gives you the flavor of Colombia. It describes the life of the putas from their perspective. It also is very romantic and kind of a poor man's Garcia Marquez. A very enjoyable read for me.
4,"Bumps, Crashes and Beautiful music",Beautiful singing. It's unfortunate that some poor guy was made to fold chairs in the room throughout the entire recording. I only wish this was an exaggeration. Listening in the car may alleviate some of the problem . . .
3,Entertaining in a Ghost Hunters Kind of Way,"This movie was essentially a fictionalized version of an episode of Ghost Hunters, and it was ok at that (I'm a big fan of Ghost Hunters, so perhaps I'm overly lenient). The story was very basic; a team of ghost hunters decide to explore the alleged hauntings of a home, only to find that there are in fact some nasty ones there. If I could, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars, not 3, but it was an ok experience. Obviously low budget, but the acting wasn't ridiculously bad. The story was ok, and decently built to a few scary moments. Good for a rental if you're in the mood for this type of story."
1,Poor Attempt at a Blair Witch Clone,I really looked forward to this movie as a resident of Louisiana who is intrigued by the haunted history of this area. However this movie is not historically accurate nor is it entertaining. This is one horror movie which is best suited for patients in the hospital recovering from heart surgery as the terror is as weak as the acting but not as pathetic.
3,"Not great, but not terrible","Well, I'm not sure this movie deserves to be lampooned. It certainly isn't terrible. The background and intro to the house is pretty shallow. In fact, the initial time spent inside the house seems almost casual and silly at times.Things finally start to get rolling after the group visits the attic. When the group splits up, the movie is at its best; just being creepy enough to stay within the ""this isn't a movie but real"" mold.There are the usual cliches and the acting can be described as amateurish, but at least it fits in with the premise that these are supposed to be normal people. I honestly felt like this movie tried, it's a far better attempt at a film than the cookie cutter action flicks or romantic comedies that Hollywood seems to think we never get enough of."
1,Dreadful,"Obviously this is a Movie and not ""REAL"", but I can't believe anyone would find this scary or even interesting.I rented this knowing that it had some bad reviews, but curious anyway.After watching this movie I can honestly say that I was angry. Not because the movie tries to gimmick itself as real, not because the actors and dialogue are lame, not even because the movie is just bad, but because it was such a lackluster production that was probably whipped together in month to ride on the Blair Witch Project coat tails.It is a blatant rip-off that does not even try to impress the viewer. That is the most unforgivable thing about this movie.Finally, yes I agree...with a previous review...May I never hear ""surround yourself with white light"" again!"
3,This Willie is only Damp...,"This album continued the decline that began with ""Keep On Smilin"", ironically their commercial breakthrough. This is pretty much a sprawling mess, with the title song, ""Leona"" (great ersatz Stones riffin) and ""She's My Lady"" about the only things worthwhile here. The rest of this album seems to be going for some Southern back porch gospel/blues thing which Wet Willie just aren't up to. Worse yet, pretty awful female background vocals on many of the tunes. Oh, Willie how ye lost yer way! This group released two amazingly good albums; ""Wet Willie II"" and ""Drippin Wet"". Then they inexplicably lost their minds and never recovered. I would pass on this."
5,The best of the best,"This is trully a one hit wonder. This album is the cream of the crop when it comes to soul and FUNK. This album has been my favorite since the 80's and will always be. SOS, Loose Ends, and Change came close to this BUT has not reached the level of trance.I WISH THERE IS MORE OF THIS ! ! ! !"
1,They Changed the Product,We loved Zatarains pre-mixed jambalaya with sausage that you just warmed up and it was ready to eat. Absolutely delicious. This product has absolutely no resemblance in taste to that product whatsoever. It doesn't even hold a resemblance of taste to jambalaya in general. I made the mistake of buying a dozen boxes and they are all in the trash now. NEVER buy a Zatarains product again.
5,Simply great!,"This was the first of Sinéad's albums I got. That was mainly because I loved ""Nothing compares 2 U"". However, now that's no longer my favourite song. There are so many fantastic songs on this album, and Sinéad has a unique style. Everybody should listen to this."
3,Terrible Fit,The parts do not fit very well. I had to pound and re-shape in order to assemble. It is clearly obvious there is little or no quality control on the product assembly line. You would think there would be at least one sample target included with the bullet box but there was not. I will keep and use it but I am not sure it is worth the price.
4,Strong box but has low quality (weak) target bracket & clip,"Overall, it's a good bullet box that does what it's supposed to do. It can take a bit of patience to get the bolts lined up but can be put together quickly. Unless you use something like Loctite or super glue, you have to regularly tighten all of the bolts. The only real problem is with the bracket and clip that hold your targets. The target bracket is extremely low-grade and was totally destroyed after being hit by six .22 LR shots from ~40 yards. I contacted Do-All Outdoors & they sent me a replacement in a couple of days but that one was destroyed in no time as well. It's easy to set targets without that bracket so that's what I've done since."
2,Confusing & disappointing cookbook,"I received this book as a gift, but would never buy it for myself or anyone.Either no one bothered to test the recipes, or someone forgot to proofread the book before it went to press. I tried the Little Oaties cookies recipe; it lists 8 ingredients, but only tells you what to do with 5 of them in the instructions. I've ended up inventing my own recipe over time (not the author's intention, I imagine!). Other recipes are similarly confusing. We had to make three versions of the Banana Bread recipe before it actually worked.My other criticism is that different variations of recipes are listed as separate recipes (e.g., Citrus Orange Cake & Toasted Coconut Pecan Cake). When you only have to substitute one or two ingredients, I think it's a variation and can be listed as a note in the same recipe. In another cookbook, these recipes wouldn't add up to 140."
3,Pretty good book...frustrating index.,"I've made a few things from this book with mixed results. The cakes I've tried have come out well along with the apple dumplings and the few frostings I've made. The chocolate chip cookies? They were awful. I baked one tray worth of them, tried one and decided they were the type of chocolate chip cookies that gave vegan cookies a bad name. I threw out the rest of the batter. I do have higher hopes for the rest of the book, though.The index is a bit maddening, and there are some other issues with editing and misleading titles. The ""Mocha Goober"" cake has no mocha in it; Coffee Frosting is listed under Coffee in the index, but not included in the listings for ""Frostings"". There are some other editorial discrepancies throughout the book - nothing major, but enough to be irritating."
5,Truly amazing!,"As I looked through the recipes in this new cookbook, I was absolutely amazed at how delicious they all appear to be. The doughnut and candy sections are especially great. And as the title proclaims, all of the recipes are 100% vegan - animal-free and cruelty-free. The author even provides an excellent section at the beginning of the book, discussing the many reasons why we want to veganize our desserts and other food, giving quite compelling reasons based on health alone. That is exceptional for a dessert book, at least the ones I've seen so far. Overall, this is an excellent cookbook for all of us vegans who have been ""deprived"" of our sweet treats for far too long, and I highly recommend it to anybody, vegan or wannabe. I would give it ten stars if they were available. Now, we vegans can have our cake (and other desserts) - and eat it too! :)"
2,Way Better Out There,"I'll admit that I only tried 3 recipes from the book - the chocolate chip cookies, pound cake and basic brownies. They were all pretty bad; I was surprised because the cover said that the author baked for a restaurant. Try baked goods (and other recipes) from Chef Brian McCarthy's Vegan Family Cookbook, Vegan Planet, or Isa Chandra Moskowitz's books."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I wish this book had worked out, but like some of the other reviewers, I just couldn't get the recipies to turn out right. Made a few of them, but they just didn't taste the way I thought they should - undercooked even after baking for much longer than the recipe directed, too heavy, too reliant on maple syrup, too much customization and experimentation required to make them work out right (or at all).It's too bad, because all the recipes look like they should be delicious...I really, really wanted this to be a good cookbook, but I gave the book away because I knew I just wouldn't use it after my failed attempts at some of the recipies."
5,Great sheets for the price!!!,I bought these sheets for Christmas and they are very soft and nice. Would recommend!
5,A Survey of Bible Prophecy,"Almost all the confusion in the religious world today( and it will increase still more when prophecy begins to be fulfilled )is due to the fact that the churches have been looking at the Bible as history, and so, looking in the wrong direction, they have no view of the goal.Rev. Bloomfield tells us, "" There is a tower. There is a landmark. There is a 'time of the end ' thoroughly developed in the Bible.Find out what it is ; understand the meaning of the prophecies concerning it ; and you have laid out for yourself a straight path through what may, at first, seem like a forest of difficulties.""The main purpose of this book is to be a chart.....a map.....The Bible is God's book. It is a revelation of His eternal program."
5,All but perfect,"Best possible bourbon glass for your first 3 drinks, after that you'll need to put it away or you could break it. It's glass is thin, but it's well worth the risk."
3,Average,"It's a decent calculator, easy to use and understand, great for the price too. However, the only reason I bought it was for a class requirement and I don't too much like it, I prefer the TI-83."
1,Battery dead on arrival,"The calculator itsself is fine, but don't use the amazon default seller, batteries are very low and although the manual says something about a solar panel, sitting it in the sun does not improve dimness of numbers so I would assume that it does not have a solar panel."
5,TI30XA,"If you don't need all the bells and whistles, this is a great calculator for the price.I am a tutor and I really like the fact that I can put it in my bag and go. The cover keeps it protected."
5,awesome,"GOOD CHARLOTTE IS F***ING AWESOME! Who said they buy their clothes from Abercrombie and Fitch? Joel and Benji actually started their own clothing line, called MADE. That's what they wear, so shut up, reviewer!!! They are awesome! They write their own songs, play their own instruments. That shows how great they are. Also, they make songs about daily life and not about sex and drugs. They're lyrics are great. So if you don't like them, don't review them!"
1,I just wanna slaughter them,"They are only called ""punk"" because they wear clothes sponsred by Aberc**ksucker and B**ch. I hate these ""guys"" so much. I can write an encyclopedia on how much I hate them - they are nothingbut a buncha filthy, disgusting, unholy piga that serve no purpose on this earth! If you like this, you're ****d up and need to be sent to an asylum NOW!"
3,one-quarter slasher movie.,"Another one of the titles that made the `Video Nasties` list for seemingly no good reason. This is three-quarters TV movie, and one-quarter slasher movie. It has some interesting ideas, but somehow, it never quite works. It`s good to see the female lead go quite mad at the end; which, if you can maintain interest until then, is worth the wait.Still can`t see how this gets banned & the likes of Braindead is passed uncut. Inconsistency somewhere..."
2,Earth Magick? Perhaps...,"Learning how to be a mage involves a lot more than rituals. It involves psychological changes, encountering reality from different perspectives, and cutting through the subjective structures that make up our reality in order to design a new worldview that allows you to make the changes you desire. Unfortunately, like almost all books on wicca, this book ignores this integral first step, and concentrates solely on rituals which are relatively worthless without this self-initiation.I'd suggest checking out some useful works on Chaos Magick, such as those by Phil Hine and Peter Carroll, before starting any of this work... without a proper understanding of the Great Work, your efforts will be useless."
3,Totally useless...,"I hate to say this, and I really wanted this tester to work. But there are 4 possible ways to insert a 20 pin plug in a 24 pin receptable, and no identifying markers showing a starting point(left side, right side, upside down or right side up???, and no specific instructions. Combine this with such poor construction that you can't actually push the pin 20 plug all the way in, even if you've accidentally found the correct position. Also, the P4 4 pin plug can be put in two ways, and who knows which way is right?It did work with the 4 pin mole connectors, and the floppy connector...so bravo for that! But how often are those the problem...Finally, there is so much pressure required in the attempt to push the 20 pin plug in place that you worry you are going to break something. I never did succeed in inserting this plug all the way in. I never could get a 20 pin reading from the power supply that I thought was faulty."
1,Hastily assembled,"This book appears to have been assembled with haste, is riddled with typos, and contains a number of old pieces reprinted and served up again at the time of Therese's doctorate."
3,This book is misrepresented as current. It is ten years old.,"The cover of this book states that it contains up to date information. In 1989 this may have been true. Of what possible good can a ten year old ""official rule book"" be? The book contains some good, if somewhat over simplified, information for beginners, but contains many vague and ambiguous references and some contradictions. Don't keep this one in the dugout as your only reference to official rules."
1,Laughing out Loud,"Jee wizz, this is one book , if I could have given it negative stars I would have..can anyone read such blatent sexism and call it spiritual? Sorry, I don't believe the reviewer who said every woman he has shown it to has been grateful, once they got past the defensiveness. I thought men are from mars women are from venus was bad enough , but this one will ensure ya never get a date with a woman who has so much as one brain cell."
4,Good Second Album,"This is a good album by Inner City. It doesn't stand head-to-head next to their debut album ""Big Fun"" but then again, sometimes it's hard to keep pace with absolute brilliance. Still, there are some standout tracks. ""Fire"" is one such track. It picks up where ""Big Fun"" left off. ""Lovelight"" and Unity"" are two other reminders of the previous album -- they are very lively ""old school"" Detroit Techno tracks. This album also has a little downtempo R&B flavor with ""That Man (He's All Mine)"" and ""What Does It take"". We also have a bit of ""ambience"" with ""'Till We Meet Again"" and ""Vibes""."
4,Good shower radio,"We have had our Zadro shower radio for over two years and are quite pleased with it. The sound is good and the unit is quite durable. We are still working on our original batteries, which is nice. There are 2 reasons reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. First, the 3 suction cups on the back are not spaced properly to fit standard tiles, so 1 suction cup always hits a grout seam and doesn't hold a seal. The two suction cups that are used, though, are quite sturdy. I think our unit has only fallen twice without any damage what-so-ever. The other reason is that the fog-free mirror doesn't produce the best reflection. All-in-all it is a good deal for your money."
1,Listen to the 1 Star,"I too bought this Anime after watching the trailer for it and I should have stopped pay attention to it after watching the opening half of the first episode. I was hoping it would get better, though I wasted my time watching the second half. The trailer looked great; well drawn anime, awesome graphics, and cool robots. The equation of a good anime, but the story was so very weak. It wasn't thrilling or electrifying, it was actually rather boring. And don't get me started about the undergarments. In the very first fight, Éclair, jumps up and off a desk, and all you see is her underwear under her very short skirt. And you see it again and again as she kicks all over. I don't know how the story develops after the first episode, but I surely don't care to find out. Don't waiting your time think about buying it, Kiddy Grade just isn't worth it."
3,"Good Sound, Unfortunate Audible Lag","The sound quality of these headphones was impressive, I had not problem with that. However my main purpose for these headphones was for playing digital keyboard late at night without waking up the wife, and there is a noticeable lag in the playback. Obviously for just listening to music this would not matter at all, but for my purpose its a knockout blow. For listening/watching movies, I'm not sure. I suspect it might be enough of a lag to notice lack of lipsink, but I didn't try it so I can't say for sure. This was my first time trying wireless headphones, and maybe this is to be expected. There is a Sony pair I might try, those are RF rather than IR. We'll see."
3,Good alternative to waking the family up,Headset is a little tight with limited adjustments. Line of sight can be disruptive. Anything in the way cuts out the sound. Even moving around in the chair can interrupt the sound. Sound itself is pretty good.
2,Comfortable but less then stellar,"While these headphones are indeed comfortable, I have found the line of site needed to prevent interference to be a pain. I am not talking about out of the room, but pillows or blankets cause interference. Not great for lying in bed. I find the simulated 5.1 surround sound so lacking that I feel the comparison is misleading. The base does provide a place to charge the provided reusable batteries, however, I often need to replace them in the middle of whatever I am watching. I would rather have a charging base that assures a full charge every time I use them. If I had the purchase to do again, I would not buy these headphones. For the price, I expected the surround experience. What I have is nice sounding stereo, but I could have got that for significantly less money."
3,"Click, Click and battery charging","Having spent a large amount of time searching for Dolby Digital headphones online, I was a bit disappointed with this set. The most annoying is having to remove the batteries from the head set to place them in the charger in contrast to just placing the headset in a charger. Also there is a clicking sound when the transmitted signal is interrupted or the head set is turned at extreme angles.The sound quality is excellent and the headset is comfortable."
3,Smaller (and of lesser quality) than expected,"SIZE:Bed is actually more like 14"" instead of 17"". Mine isn't even 17"" across at the widest point of the base. The inside circular base is approximately 14"" wide. The opening at the front is about 10"" across at the bottom, and is sloped steeply enough that there's not a lot of room to snuggle or burrow inside the ""blanket.""My cat weighs about 9lbs and while she could probably FIT inside the bed, it's about as big as she is curled up, and there's no extra room to sprawl (as she is wont to do...).FABRIC:Inside fabric is a very nice berber polar fleece. Outside fabric feels like a fake, plasticky velour -- very cheap feeling, and doesn't seem like it would wear very well, OR hold up to a pet lounging on or around it.BOTTOM LINE:If you're at all worried about size, I might recommend either getting the larger one (PetMate Burrow BedorPetmate 25"" Burrow Bed, Colors may vary) or looking for something of higher quality."
1,"Too ""Poofy""","This purchase was a big disappointment. The bed I received was overstuffed, making it impossible for a pet to lie on it -- the stuffing rolls them off the bed. This makes it totally unusable for my 5# chihuahua much less the larger cats.The photo shows a much less stuffed model. When I get the time, I'll rip open a seam and pull half the stuffing out and re-sew."
3,not as good as I thought,It won't stay open at all. my pets all sleep on top of it but never get in side it & my pets love to get inside of the blankets
4,Kill Clause,"Well written, a good story line, and a good read for anyone looking to spend some time. I would read more of his work."
1,And???,"I could not get into this book. I tried, but every time I picked it up, I read a page or 2 and waited for something to happen. Agree with another reviewer, very short on action. I actually didn't finish it. No more Hurwitz for me."
1,aerial assault trap thrower,I put it together and it worked great for about 30 birds then it broke. Do all sent another one with very little waiting time. But the about the same thing happen about 30 or 40 targets it broke same thing just stopped throwing it would rotate alright but would not throw. I just give up took the $400 money loss and went and got a different kind of thrower.
5,This show is so well written..LOVE IT!,I just started watching glee for the Britney episode and I'm hooked. The music and acting is great with great scripts .. It's my new favorite show. One of my favorite episodes was the new Christmas one..wish it would have been on this DVD set. Just got Season 1..thanks Santa
4,I love this band,"I'm going to be short here...I purchased this album along withCrimson Skies + 1 BONUS TRACKin 2006.This is a great album, you hear every instrument and every lyric in perfect clarity, I was impressed. I am glad that I made this purchase, and I am sure that you will also.Just to warn you:The production quality of this Album is not exactly top notch. Seems to me that maybe they rushed production, or did not have the budget to make those last 'tweaks', or perhaps it was intentionally mastered this way. I am unable to explain, take a listen and decide for yourself. Either way it does not affect enjoyability.Is it Generic?Well that is an interesting question. Most bands within a Genre have a similar sound to them, otherwise there would not be fans of said Genre (and possibly why we have a million Sub-Genres in Metal). My opinion is that: If you like Good Prog/Power Metal, you will be far from disappointed here."
3,Still Not Strong Enough,"I purchased these to hang two oven mitts on the side of my refrigerator. They hold for a while, but without fail I can see them slowly sinking after a few days. They would hold something a bit lighter, but not the mitts. FYI, I use one hook for each mitt."
2,problem with hinges,"The 17"" screen looks awesome, but it is so heavy that the hinges holding it give in after some time. It starts with mild cracking sound when you close or open the laptop, but then the hinge may break suddenly. Lubricating is of limited help."
4,Unfortunately Still Relevant..,"I'm not dissing this book;it's just that it's too bad that 30+ years later we still have many of the same problems in our public school systems. This book is both funny and rather scary,especially the eye-opening statistics(sic) the author sprinkles throughout the book. One can only imagine how worse(the facts) are today,but it shows that a dedicated,committed teacher possibly can make a difference. Even if they only get through to a few of their students,it's a start."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent Book. I was a third generation NYC teacher. This book was amazing for its time, and still is relevant. The school system has over 1.1 million students, larger than some small countries. Sharp, witty, and funny."
5,DEMAND YOUR LOCAL GROCER CARRY THIS PRODUCT,"Local store's discontinued sale - 3.50 USD.I bought a jar.Upon eating some I was stunned at what was happening to my mouth. Eager to replicate the impossible, I took another spoonful.The next day I bought the rest of the jars. There are no more jars. After the last I slept for 20 hours.I'm scared. If I order more, part of me will be satiated, but at a terrible cost to my faculties. The agonizing wait makes purchasing a zero sum game.Apricots taste like ash now."
1,Bad leaks over 3 years,"After three years, we have had it with Sun Water Systems (the maker of Aquasana). The problems are the same as those of numerous reviewers: The housing has broken and leaked six times in three years. The O rings don't fit properly. The plastic seems mis-molded. The faucet leaks.For a while Sun Water Systems kept sending us free housings to replace the cracked ones. Then they said they had a new design to fix the problem; but the problem persists. Our water pressure is fine and we installed it carefully. Yet the housing keeps cracking--causing major leaks under the sink--and now Sun wants to charge us for replacing their poor engineering.We'll switch to something better, even if it costs more."
1,Cheap Materials,I had to post this because of the problems I've had with the quality of the product. I've had problems with the threads on the housing caps breaking and the housings themselves breaking. I've gone through several of each in a couple of years time even with being careful about water pressure and tightening of the threads. The people I've talked to at the company have been ok to deal with but this is just annoying. My shower filter from them just broke as well. I've ordered a system from someone else that uses stronger 10 inch filter housings and standard 10 inch filters which are cheaper in the long run as you're not locked into a proprietary system. Hope this helps someone make a better informed choice than I did.
5,Not since Jon Vickers,"I never thought I could here a more moving rendition of Samson,s desparate cry for help (third act) than Jon Vickers'. Jose Cura's eclipses even that. Cura obviously understands every word he sings and knows how to ""act"" it. Stupendous! P.S. It's not that I'm 13 but the box doesn't go above."
5,A good resource when read along with its companion book.,"When read with its companion book on liberal Catholics (""What's Left"", also edited by Mary Jo Weaver), this is an excellent reference for understanding the issues that face thinking Catholics in America today.On an earlier reviewer's objection to the use of the term ""Anglo"" to refer to non-Hispanic Catholics in America, including those of Irish descent like himself, I would like to point out that ""Anglo"" is really an abbreviated form of ""anglophone"", which refers (in New Mexico, as in Quebec) to those of us whose native tongue is English. I doubt that the objecting reviewer speaks Irish Gaelic today, any more than I speak German today. From the point of view of the linguistic minorities in North America, we are both anglophones, or ""Anglos"" for short. It's accurate. Live with it."
4,thank you!,"I got this for my dog to use in training and rehabilitating her. After a few trail sessions of wearing the muzzle to get her use to it, she doesn't mind it anymore. She now views it as part of her ensemble when going out for a walk and it gives me the piece of mind that I need to go through training with her and feel safe. Thank You!"
1,Not for timed tests or use in dim areas,"I bought this calculator for the FE exam and ended up returning it. It was often very slow to turn on, sometimes even in bright settings. The calculations were very slow. It should not take 2+ seconds to give me the sine of 45 deg! Considering they're about the same cost, buy a Casio fx115 instead."
5,A new atmosphere,I've been listening to the Gypsy Kings since i was a kid and now that im 21 i still listen to them. I have these group of friends who also have been listening to the GK's music since their childhood days. It's practically our theme song whenever we go to the beach and soak in the sun. We can't get enough of the songs 'cause they bring us to a new world where life is just so relaxing. We even put the songs on during any of our dinner parties. It makes us feel like we are all in Spain and relaxing with a glass of sanggria and having just a good time.
5,A must-have CD!,"If you ever travel to Provence or Cote D'Azure, don't forget to take this CD with you. Heaven!"
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!!,Do I really even have to give it a star? It was easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Whoever gave this four stars must be trying to impress people with their film knowledge or artsy taste. I felt as though I was watching a movie starring a bunch of adult film stars - minus the adult film. I'm seriously regretting that I wasted two hours on this horrible film. Wow - it was really that bad!!
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Oh my god, this was terrible. Literally the worst thing I have ever seen. Every single review marking this movie as terrible is dead on. The leading lady makes Denise Richards look like she has depth. She makes Carrot Top seem like he could win an Oscar. And she makes the muppets look like they're articulate. The entire movie is dubbed, and to call it poorly done would be praising it. It's done so badly, that at one point I wondered if some freak accident happened to the reels and they were forced to dub sound over at the last minute on 5 dollars, on one take. Honestly, every person in this movie is terrible, including Bradley Cooper, which hurts me strictly because of Wet, Hot American Summer. Anyone that gave this review positive marks had to have been in it, and shameless."
1,Huge waste!,for a movie made in this decade - it was like a bad 80's flick. I feel more dumb for having sat through the entire movie. What a sad excuse of a movie.
1,How do I give a .0003 star rating?,No need to go on about how bad this movie was- I would just like to mention that all the horrible reviews are dead on!
1,Wish I could give it less than 1 star...,"This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. I LOVE romantic comedies and have a growing collection. I popped this movie in around 7:00pm and by 7:20, I was dozing off... literally. List of reasons to never see this movie:1. The acting is so bad in this movie that it makes the cast of Days of Our Lives look like Academy Award winners.2. It looks and sounds like they borrowed my parent's 80's camcorder to make this movie.3. PLOT?!!! From beginning to end, I had the same question: ""huh?""The only enjoyable part of the entire movie is seeing Bradley Cooper's gorgeous face. Everything else sucks. Please rent this movie before you buy it so you don't make the same mistake I did. I paid 9 bucks for this crap."
1,disappointed,The item that was pictured was the one I thought I ordered. appearently not. I hope the seller fixes the picture as to not mislead another customer.
3,Good Trail Mix Bars,"These trail mix bars are very tasty, crunchy and chewy at the same time, and have natural ingredients. The only down side is that the fiber is a bit lower than I would have expected."
4,Great chewy/crunchy taste,"I work behind a desk 8-10 hrs/day so this is a nice snack before lunch or in the afternoon to tide me over.It packed a crunch along with a chewy bite. I could taste the nuts, raisins and even cranberries with each bite.And yes as with the other reviewers, I agree a lot of sugar.So wouldn't recommend regularly but every now and then to take the pang of hunger away before your next meal."
3,Not up to usual Barry standards,"Dave Barry is a great humorist, and I've read about 8 of his books so far, but this one was by far the worst. Not terrible, just not as funny as the others I've read, which I would rate in the 8 - 1O range. If you've never read him, don't read this one first, you'll be doing yourself a disservice."
5,The funniest book you will EVER read.,"I re-read this book at least once a year and don't even care if people on the subway look at me funny for laughing out loud. The way Dave rewrites history is brilliant and hysterically funny, absolute genius. You will actually laugh so hard you will cry. If you want to see Dave at his finest, read this book."
1,This was pretty funny... for about 10 pages.,"This book was pretty funny... for about 10 pages then it got really old. It took me about 60 pages to give up on it altogether. There's a reason that SNL skits only last five minutes, Dave.I understand Barry is a columnist of some sort so in small chunks his material is probably golden but in book format this just didn't work at all."
4,A little forced,"Dave Barry is much more than a humorist;he is a brilliant essayist on American culture. While this was a good read, I had the feeling that he had a deadline to reach and pushed too fast.Still, a bad Barry book is still much better than a good anybody else."
1,Burn it with fire....,"set it alight and let it fly. Oh scratch that reverse the car over it, I'm allergic to burning polymers. I'll keep it brief. I hate this calculator. It fails to follow order of operations. Hate this calculator. I am ordering a different one today. I will not go grovel to professor again about my work showing one thing but the calculator did what it wanted.Burn baby burn"
4,It's a calculator.,"Well, it's a scientific calculator some of my classes required. It does scientific functions and stuff, has solar power... really it's just an everyday calculator, not much to say, but it works just fine."
4,Gets the job done.,"Needed this for my pre calc class since we are not allowed to use our graphing calculators. It does what it says, no complaints except that the buttons a a little wobbly and don't register easily at times. So be careful during exams."
1,I HATE THIS CALCULATOR,I've bought this calculator 2x because its the only ones they sale around here and both times I've been so disappointed. The keys suck and sometimes you'll hit a number and it wont even registar. I HATE THIS THING!
2,Keypad sticks,I was looking for a less complete calculator than my TI-82 but find that this one really sticks. I get an outrageous answer and realize I missed a digit somewhere. Very frustrating.
3,It's aright,"Obviously nothing like my TI-84 which I was no longer allowed to use in college, but good for what I needed. Its very lightweight and feels sort of flimsy but it doesn't require batteries which is nice. My real complaint is that the cover is difficult to slide on or off and scratches up the sides of the calculator."
1,Less than 1 star,"You know, it's too bad you can't rate something a negative; cause I'd probably rate this a Negative 5. I was trying to glue a plastic handle back on to a steel knife tang, that one side of the handle came off.I did as the instructions said: I cleaned both the plastic & the steel. Then I used sandpaper to roughen up the parts a little. Then I mixed the epoxy (you have 6 minutes before it hardens). Applied it to both sides, slid it around for just a few seconds to spread the epoxy around, then clamped it in a vise for over 24 hours. Put the knife together, laid it down, and didn't pick up the knife til the next day. Put the knife in my pocket; pulled it out less than 90 minutes later to cut a cardboard box, and the plastic part practically came off in my hand - it took very little pressure to remove it all the way off. Yet they claim 3000 psi - yeah, right.This was my first time using the Gel. I am NOT impressed.I bet you won't be either."
3,"""As Long As I'm With You"" is a beautiful song!","I only bought this CD for the song ""As Long As I'm With You."" It's a ballad that I heard on the radio, years ago, and have loved ever since."
3,"I love the look, but...","First off, this wallpaper looks great and has a nice texture. It actually looks like real brick unless you get right up on it. It is very easy to trim and apply. I am very pleased with the finished product.What kept me from giving it a higher rating? While it is easy to apply, it is difficult to align to keep the pattern looking right. I actually had to move down the roll about 14 inches to get it aligned, wasting too much of it. Thankfully, I was able to use many of these ""scrap"" pieces to fill in spots. Also, as someone else mentioned, buy more than you think you'll need. I only bought one roll to do a VERY small half bathroom. There was not enough to do two complete walls. I even cheated and didn't paper behind the large bathroom mirror."
2,Worn White Edges,"My only complaint is that the factory edges of this wallpaper are white. Which means no matter what you do, seems are going to show. Not sure whether I just got a bad roll or what, but I'm a little disappointed. It's hard enough getting seems nice when the paper is good, but when the factory edges are bad, you don't stand a chance. Probably should have returned it, but i didn't know the paper was at fault until a pro looked at it. Well, it's up now so it will probably stay there."
3,Somewhat skeptical,"It was not mentioned in the book, that Mr. Onada was forgiven for 29 Filipino deaths caused by him. It is difficult for me to beleve he could have been so naive and ignorant."
2,WHERE THE HEART IS,"Disappointing- as a Boorman admirer I had expected to enjoy it, but found it flat and stagey. The dated, hammy acting style seemed intentional but the intention was obscure. The arty visuals however were marvellous"
1,Terrible,"I have been using this for years, and have several cats. This year, it DID NOT work at all, and I have wasted over 150.00 on this product. It does not work AT all. Now, I am going to have to take all of them to vet, and get fleas removed from our home! Total waste of money, and no recourse apparantly? I am not sure what they changed in this product, but it is not the same, and I wish they had informed customers like myself, who have been using this for years. Now, I am going to be spending hundreds of dollars to get rid of the fleas!Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 Doses"
1,"did nothing, the fleas scoffed at it!","I tried this product twice this summer on my three cats. I rescued a stray and ended up with fleas in the house. I dosed all three of them on two different occasions. It didn't even slow the fleas down at all and the problem got worse and worse. I tried the Advantage II for cats and all three of them stopped scratching within 24 hours. It has been three weeks and still no fleas. I am not sure what is going on with the Frontline Plus, I have used it for years and it worked great, but this year it was a total waste of money."
1,Can it give it less than one star?,I bought Frontline plus for cats at the beginning of the summer. Then spent the entire summer battling fleas. It seemed to have absolutely no effect. I was afraid to put another product on them so I bathed and bombed. We spent the summer frantic. I finally found CapStar - combined it with Advantage and we have peace.
3,Frontline,This product was fine but didn't come in the original box so I found that disconcerting and it did take a while to ship.
1,Go to pet store,I bought frontline here as an experiment for cost. This batch was ineffective. I don't fault the seller. I threw away the packaging and used all six vials for three cats in less than six weeks. My fault.
1,Don't buy online,"We have been using Frontline for our cats for years with great results. However, we started buying online the last few orders and began seeing ticks and fleas on our cats, but not our dog (we buy Frontline for our dog at the vet). We talked to our veterinarian and to my daughter (also a vet) and they both said that online Frontline is often expired and repackaged or fake. So beware of buying Frontline online and get it from your vet. The extra $20 is worth not seeing disgusting ticks and fleas on your animals."
1,Doesn't work anymore...,"I have used this for my cats for as long as I can remember. My cats are 13 years old and 6 years old...this worked fine for them all those years, but for some reason the one I purchased from amazon does not work. I don't know if the product is bad or maybe a knockoff, but this does nothing! I put it on them, and the next day they are still itchy with fleas. I think I am going to try Revolution once I finish my 6 pack or start buying Frontline Plus from my vet!"
4,Frontline for cats,"We've been keeping my daughter's cat since she moved into an apartment building not allowing cats. The cat is a long haired! She loves outside- in the screened in porch to sun. However, thanks to Frontline Plus, I am not worrying about her getting diseased from something out there biting her. Thanks for having it available on Amazon.com. It was real convenient to shop and buy it, cheaper than the vets office and came before needed."
3,Suggestion,"So many seem unhappy with this product. Please consider discussing your purchase with your veterinarian and getting the product they recommend for your unique situation. Since they often have promotions, rebates, and many are willing to price match, you may find that it is cost effective to purchase from your vet's office. Then you have confidence in the product's origin, packing, instructions, and application to your need. It never hurts to ask. I'm glad I did."
2,I'm not sure about this product,"I'm just not sure that for this price there is enough product that gets to the cat's skin. The price is low, but is the amount sufficient to work? My cats have not thrown off the fleas and with two applications 30 days apart, they should have. I'm going to try one more month, and then if the fleas aren't dead, I will have to switch products."
5,Kills fleas!,"My two cats picked up fleas and one of my cats was actually scratching off part of her fur because the flea saliva was causing an allergic reaction to her skin. I put frontline on both of them, and within a day, there was a significant decrease in their scratching and after two or three days, they completely stopped scratching! The dosage has lasted at least a month, so it is well worth the price for a month-long flea control. My only complaint is that the dosage is pretty large. (You have to put the entire in one spot on the back of their neck). As a result, the back of my cats' necks looked kinda greasy for a few days until they cleaned it off I guess. I just wish I don't have to put as much and still have the same results.And amazon had the best price out there. Some of the other pet websites were charging double the price of amazon."
1,Doesn't work,This was a waste of money. My cat is covered in fleas and now I have to wait 30 days before I can switch him over to a product that DOES work.
1,stops working,"I would caution against using this product for more than a few months because it stops working. I had been using it on my 3 cats and noticed that after about 15 days, the fleas would return in full force. I did some research online which showed many other reports of Frontline no longer working, and when I called the vet they also suggested we move on to another product."
1,Not like it used to be,"I have been using Frontline for years, however recently it has not been working so well. I can give my dog and two cats the treatment each month and it does NOT last for the whole month. In fact when I brought up this complaint to my vet, he said that Frontline is only promised to work for 21 days and yet they tell us to apply it once a month!! Once I finish this box by applying it every 21 days I plan on switching to something a little more reliable."
2,Dont Like at ALL,"Got this one because it is one of top brands, this brand burned my cats' skin at base of neck, never saw that before, so I switched to Advantage."
1,Didn't work!,"Bought this product as I have used the same thing for several years on my cat. Never had fleas since the cat has never been outside but sometime this summer, fleas got inside my home I suspect on pants or socks and my cat picked them up. Ordered new product to continue with the regime but the flea problem got out of control after 2 applications of it not working. Emailed the seller who was very gracious and immediately refunded my money. Wonderful seller who I highly recommend working with. I will have to change brands since Frontline is no longer working for this house!"
3,Efficacy is spotty,"We have used Frontline Plus for our cat every summer and sometimes it doesn't seem to work, other times it seems to work very well. This particular purchase ended up coming to us from Israel and took a while to arrive. I would have expected to pay a discount for this sort of purchase, but not the case. Anyway, this batch didn't seem to work so well. Manufacture date was recent. Is it the real deal or counterfeit? Hard to say."
2,Empty vials,"When I opened the packaging for the first time, I noticed that more than half of the vials were completely empty. Either they had been tampered with or had leaked...also my cat has gotten fleas for the first time ever when I started using this product ordered from Merial and we have always used Frontline and never had any issues. Beware!"
2,Such a bummer. now we have fleas.,"WE have three cats. In the past, we had used Advantage, but there was a sale on Frontline and the cat on the cover looks like mine so I figured that I would give it a shot.HUGE MISTAKE. After three years of no fleas, within one month of using Frontline, we are now in a HUGE flea infestation.We re-doused them with Frontline twice to no visible effect.Back to Advantage, and we have to figure out how to de-flea our house without too much toxicity (two young children to protect). Thanks anyway Frontline."
2,Questionable effectiveness of Frontline,I've been buying Frontline Plus for our three cats for years. This summer (2009) fleas have been an issue and the Frontline doesn't seem effective at all.
1,"Wasted money on this product, fleas are happy","We have two dogs and two cats. The product has done absolutely nothing to control the fleas. Plus, my older my cat had an allergic reaction on her neck. The fleas have moved into our house and will not leave! Cannot wait until I can apply Advantix, a product that actually works. Save your money everyone!"
5,Fleas no thank you please,"Great Price! Fast delivery! There is nothing like frontline to rid your pet and house of those nasty little pesky fleas. I repeat there is nothing like it, fast acting and lasts about a month."
2,reviews,This product works if you dont get a placebo vial. Every time I have ordered this product and Advantage I get vial/vials that simply dont work. I think these should be investigated by Weights and Measures. I used these on my two cats in 1 month and there are still fleas. Sometimes works sometimes not. This has been the case for several years of using and this product is way to expensive to slip in placebos. Weights and Measure please check this.
4,I like Frontline.,"I have three cats and I use Frontline for all of them. It works well for two of the cats, but not for the third. I am not sure if the problem with my third cat has anything to do with Frontline, but she still suffers with fleas even after application. The other cats are fine. I will still purchase Frontline and use it."
5,"Great Product, BETTER price!","We've never used Frontline before, because it's usually so expensive. This was WELL worth the money, and getting it as cheap as we did ensured protection against fleas and ticks for out cat. We will definitely buy this again!"
2,Not for us,"I'm sure it works fine for some cats, but ours had an allergic reaction to it. Would not purchase again."
4,Not fake,Wasnt fake like some people say it is. Maybe they are getting different products from other manufacturers. Someone described an orange syringe which is similar to a competing frontline product. Mine was fine.
1,Did not work on my 2.cats!!,I found thus product to be worthless on my 2 cats ! They had a few fleas each ...they go outside on occasion and it did not make a difference . I used 2 doses in a few weeks of each other on both and they are still scratching . I bought a shampoo at the grocery store that worked better than this expensive treatment . Was not satisfied at all ! I'm sorry to have listened to reviews on this product and recommendations from vets.
4,Flea free cats,I was almost scared off from ordering because the estimated receive date was a month from the order date. That was not the case and I had the product within 2 weeks. Good customer service when I contacted the company and a good price for this product. I was satisfied.
1,Frontline is garbage nowadays,"Frontline plus doesnt work anymore, I'm in the middle of the 2nd dose for both dog and cat and my animals are covered in fleas and house is infested with them it worked many years ago perfectly and a couple years ago it didnt work, I was desperate so I tried it again and it still doesnt work, they either changed the formula or fleas adapted to it. Will never buy again. Not worth the money. If it doesnt work why sell it? I want my money back."
1,Resistant fleas?,"Over 1 full week after the application of frontline to both of my cats and I see absolutely NO change in flea population, either on them or in the house. No dead fleas on the cats, no dead fleas on the floor.. Just live, jumping, biting, fleas.Perhaps the population of fleas here in Santa Barbara is resistant to Frontline now? Either way, it was a complete waste of almost $60 for a 6 month supply."
4,Works better,We tried to go with the less expensive stuff from Walmart but my poor kitties were miserable. We went back to this stuff and it has helped a great deal. We are still fighting fleas but not as bad.
4,Frontline Plus,Quick delivery-Product was as described-Great for keeping the ticks off my cats. I have never had any fleas as well.
2,Not very impressed.,"Frontline seems to work for the first week, but afterward the cat is just as infested as before. Even with the discount you get on Amazon, it's too much to pay for a product that doesn't work as advertised. I'm going to try Advantage instead."
5,Frontline Plus for Cats,"The price that I received this product for through Amazon.com was fantastic. I will continue to order through Amazon in order to reap the financial benefits of this particular product. I have three cats, and it becomes extremely costly to purchase this item each month. Through Amazon, I can order a larger supply, to have on hand."
5,Frontline Plus,Our veternarian has prescribed this for our cats for years. The cost was getting higher and higher so I checked online prices. Here at Amazon it is available at a much more reasonable price including shipping.
2,Didn't Work,"My veterinarian said I was wasting my money on Frontline. I had used it in the past with good results, so I bought it anyway. It came fast and in regular packaging, but it didn't work, period. We ended up with a full-blown flea infestation. Our vet used Advantage on my cat while he was getting neutered (wearing Frontline) because he had fleas. The fleas started dying off immediately and were gone in 24 hours. I used it on all 4 cats with excellent results. I didn't have to treat my house or yard. A month later, still no fleas."
1,Does not work,"FrontLine Plus for cats did not work for my cat. On the advice of the sales lady at a veterinary dispensary, I bought this product instead of Advantage, the product my vet normally prescribes for my cat (and which actually works!). I must say I am terribly disappointed. I applied the dosage exactly as directed in the instructions. It has been a week and my cat is still scratching like crazy from fleas. Fortunately, I only bought a single pack and not the whole box. My advice to anyone considering this product is to save your money and buy something else! Based on my experience, I would not recommend Frontline Plus to anyone."
5,Works very well,"I have 3 cats, one long hair, one young short hair female, and one 15 year old shorthair female. Two are indoor, the older one outdoor. And this product protects all of them. The trick is to not just use this product, but also use flea bombs to kill the eggs and larvae of the fleas in your house or else you and your pet will always be stuck with fleas.I deffinatly recomend to others. And I live where there's a lot of pine trees and a creek...and this works."
3,not as effective as expected,"I purchased both the cat and the dog Frontline Plus for my various pets. I had thought that, given the price, this would be an amazing product. Instead, my dog continued to suffer with fleas and my cats started scratching their ears, as was mentioned by other reviewers. I decided to persevere and gave all the animals their second treatment the following month and they are all doing much better, although I'm not sure whether it's because of the Frontline or because the weather's getting cooler. I think I might try another remedy instead of repurchasing this one."
3,Not bad,"Frontline has always been the go to for my kitty. However, over the years it doesn't seem to work quite as well."
2,Revolution is better.,"Just think, cats have to lick it sometimes when they wash themselves. Ingredients of this product is more harmful than in Revolution. You can research it yourself."
1,"I don't now, my cat still has fleas!",2 month later cat still has fleas!Maybe after 6 month they have vanished ?
2,NOT THE BEST!,"Unfortunately Soldiers of Ice was a quite a disappointment! The title is a bit misleading if you are expecting epic battles/wars. There are encounters with ice mephits and elementals (one of each...) and gnolls, but the book lacks that extra something needed to push it over the top. Both the plot and the writing are average. Instead, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the ""heavy artillery"" Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read the Soldiers of Ice only after you're done reading most of the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material."
4,Something Different,"This is the only Forgotten Realms novel I own or have thus far read from ""the Harpers"" series. I wasn't really sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.The story is fairly straight forward. The main character is a ranger trying to gain membership to the Harpers and is thus sent on basic reconnaissance mission as a test. As expected, the whole mission falls apart.She has to use her wits and quickly forge alliances between different races which include a Gnoll shaman, a clan of hardy Gnomes, and a Human fighter living as a hermit.I thought the story was very well written that was quite enjoyable with a straightforward plot that is easy enough to follow.I would suggest this title if you want to read a Forgotten Realms story that is straight forward and a little different."
2,Buyer beware,Please be aware that each episode of The Yogi Bear Show Season 2 only contains 8 minutes of Yogi Bear. The other two shows in the episode have nothing to do with Yogi. One is a character called Snaglepuss and the other is a character called Yakky Doodle. While the description mentions the characters names it is not clear that they have nothing to do with Yogi (which was very disappointing to the 9 year old I purchased the season for). If you are an avid Hanna Barberra fan you may know this but I am not so I wanted to make others who may not know aware of this.
1,Defective game,This game came with no dice included. No way to return for refund or replacement as it was bought as a gift more than 30 days before opening. Back to Barnes and Noble for me.
3,Great Value,We normally just buy some dice and make up our own sheets to play bunco but this is a great price to get the dice and paper and pencils. The ladies loved that the pencils said Bunco Time and I liked the bell. The box helps keep everything together.
3,Basic Images on Fabric,"I was a little disappointed with this book. I decided to keep this book for reference purposes. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book if this will be your only book for ""images on fabric"""
5,Dell latitude D610 hard disk carrier drive caddy from Amazon,It was exactly as described and met my needs.I needed it urgently and received it on time as promised by Amazon.I highly recommend Amazon to all who will read this review.Amazon prices are the best.
2,Disappointed in Product,The aquasana unit is less than a year old but the spring inside the spout to the filter broke twice. When it broke the first time they were very nice when my husband and I spoke to them and they replaced the part for free - but we haven't contacted them since it broke again.We're back to buying bottled water until we can find another counter top water filter.
3,"Until there is a better product, I will use Aquasana","We've been using the under sink Aquasana for about 4 years now. Yes, it's a pain to change filters. I had to keep notes to remind myself each year to tap one of them on the counter to get it out after opening the casing, and it does take a little work to get the seal tight to stop leaking. I keep it in a bucket under the sink instead of mounting it.The filters are expensive but the first year I measured how much cold tap water we filter and my family of 2 doesn't come close to the total capacity so we let it go a few more months than suggested. Would be nice if they had a smaller capacity unit at a smaller price.Right now I need to buy a new unit since one of the filter casings is jammed and won't open. Broke the tabs on top trying to get it open. Did some research and it seems there are no other reliable products so until a company makes a better filter, I will order another Aquasana."
1,Junk! Save your $!,"Don't buy this product! It's a piece of junk from start to finish! It's poorly designed white plastic prone to breaking. It's difficult to install this item on your faucet, and nearly impossible to change the water filters in six months. Customer service is completely unhelpful and do nothing to make the experience any better. I wasted my money in a product that was marginal on day one, and completely nonfunctional in six months. Don't waste your time and your money. Buy a better water filtration system from the start, that's NSF certified (which is one is not), and get it right the first time. Wish I did ...."
3,Works well for the first two years,"We have had the Aquasana installed for about 2 years now and all was well until February of this year when the unit started leaking. The water is very clean and pure and it tastes great. However, we have had the system start leaking twice in the last 6 months and both times the cap thread has broken away from the cap so allowing water to leak out. After the second time this happened I'm now researching a new filter system to replace Aquasana - the flooded cabinet is not worth buying another replacement part."
1,Aquasana needs to address durability issue,"Similar to other reviewers, I am on my 3rd housing unit after a year and a half of use due to cracked housing. Like with other reviewers, customer support initially suggested that our water pressure was perhaps too high. My house was built in 1914 and high water pressure is a problem I wish I could have. Luckily for us, my wife did subscribe to the lifetime filter program, so the company we purchased it from (bestfilters) has had to replace the unit free of charge each time. They do charge $10 for shipping however. I sincerely hope Aquasana addresses the durability issue. Aside from that, the water looks and tastes good."
3,Not as great as it claims to be,"I bought this novel because Svevo was often compared along with Proust, Joyce, and Musil (according to the short review inside of Musil's The Man without Qualities). Proust and Joyce are well known, but Musil is not. After reading Musil's The Man without Qualities, which extremely impressed me (for me, it is THE best 20th-century novel), I tried Svevo, because I expected to find another hidden diamond like Musil. To my disappointment, however, the novel is not very interesting at all (I almost forced my way through 2/3 of it, but that was all. I couldn't even finish it). For me, Svevo is not an underrated writer as Musil or Gombrowicz is."
1,Not Worth It,"I followed the direction to the T on this one, I even broke down and pulled out a ruler to make sure the hair length was correct. In the end, I was just sticky and still hairy as I only managed to pull out one hair."
1,this was such a nothing movie I was very surprised it had 5 stars,again this dvd was nothing but two old men talking about life and death I throught with this two very big starsit would be a great movie but was I surprised
3,Good overview,"As far as I am aware, this is the only book out there in English to look at the connections and divergences in philosophy and praxis of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayuveda, the traditional healing techniques and systems of China and India respectively. As such, it provides an important service. It is written for the general public, and so, students of either or both of the healing systems won't find much new in the respective sections on them. However, it is an excellent introductory overview to both systems. In addition, serious students and practitioners will benefit from the attempt to look at the differences and similarities in the two ancient systems. While a much more in-depth account is certainly needed, I hope Svoboda, an excellent and exteremely important writer, teacher, and practitioner of Ayurveda and Tantra, doesn't get around to it anytime soon, because I hope to eventually write it myself!"
1,"TERRIBLE picture, VHS better than this","This a great film ruined by an awful DVD. This MADACYENTERTAINMENT/""HOLLYWOOD CLASSICS"" thing is ... seriously overpriced.Great film, terrible DVD.The packaging is good. The problem is the TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY! The picture is blurry and from a bad print, and part of the picture is cropped off. For instance, the title of the film reads ""METROPOLI"".Hopefully the AFI or another company can release a great DVD of this great film, or maybe it's already happened. If/when it happens, I suspect that whoever releases it will make good money."
1,Good movie; horrible dvd,"Yes, Metropolis is a classic and is a wonderful film which I love. I only wish when they made this DVD they would have used the restored version.... I remember seeing a restored version in the theatre, and not just the GM colorized rehash. So why didn't they use that one? The resulting film is so fuzzy and out of focus it is almost unwatchable.This is a great film, I only wish it had a decent DVD to go with it."
1,Metropolis DVD does not do Lang's Masterpiece justice,"I remember this film as a breathtaking visual feast, but this transfer to DVD is dreadful! We loose the perimiter of the picture, most noticeable when heads are cut off at the top of frame. I am sure there are better quality prints out there, the one used for this transfer was dark and murky. The music chosen seemed wildly inappropriate at times, I ended up turning the sound down, it was so distracting."
1,A Major Disappointment,"When I first found out that Metropolis had been produced in DVD I was thrilled. When I played it, I was disappointed to say the least.I had expected the DVD would be of the American release of the 80's (two thumbs-up from Siskel & Ebert) with the rock music score (which it was not) but the quality of the video is the real disappointment -- it would have to improve to be poor -- unwatchable when compared to the copy of a copy of a tape I already had.I should have read the other reviews before purchasing. I now have a shiny... beer coaster."
1,Dreadful,"(I wish I could give 0 stars)Sigh. An exercise in you-get-what-you-pay-for. I found this DVD at Target for 9 or 10 dollars, and jumped for it, thinking that I'd better get it now since vids of classics don't seem to have a long shelf life.I just put it in the DVD for the first time, and I tell you it about made me sick to my stomach. I could only bear to watch two minutes, before I ran to my computer to see if other folks agreed that it was bad - maybe this is the best that was available? I guess I'm relieved that there are much better transfers out there, just not in DVD. I'll wait for one of those."
1,Inferior Video Transfer,"Madacy continues to underwhelm when it comes to video transfers to the DVD medium. Copies always look as though they were made from an inferior VHS tape. If you ever wondered why Madacy's DVD titles were so inexpensive, now you know. The movie itself is a classic, however."
1,Worst DVD transfer EVER!,This DVD is from an EP mode video which is fuzzy and has visable lines. The opening titles have the M and S cut off! It is not played at the correct speed. Get the DVD from the U.K. if you have a multi region DVD player (Sampo is a good one to get).
5,Must be a great one.,"I still haven`t seen this film because frankly,the one I purchased had keyboard music as a soundtrack and it was impossible to listen to.The drama of the music didn`t sinchronise with the moments being displayed at that time.I had to turn the film off after 8 minutes and returned it to the store.Is there a copy with the original music? I really like to know. Ron."
5,State of the Art Classic.,I believe enough good things have been said about this excellent release.What I would like to add is the way the movie in all it's silent glory draws you in.A must see for any mature filmgoer.The sets are simply stunning and the same goes for the restoration.
2,metropolis,I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND HAVE AN EARLIER VERSION. DID NOT CARE FOR THE SOUNDTRACK ON THIS. WILL STAY WITH THE OLDER VERSION.
1,Madacy ruins Sci-Fi classic,"The Madacy Entertainment version of Metropolis is just plain horrid. It's very inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for. This particular DVD looks like it was produced using THE worst print of the film that could be found and THE worst transfer equipment that could be found. It has the appearance of being the first experimental project someone tried who was just learning how to transfer film to video. We won't even begin to discuss the nasty soundtrack and silly music on this version.I'm only glad I didn't spend very much on this disc - it'll make a nice drink coaster, I guess. I'll be on the lookout for a better DVD version of this amazing Sci-Fi classic."
5,A must see! Awesome restoration!,"This is the one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Amazing to see pre-WWII German filmaking at it's finest. This is a wonderful restoration. No blinking. Amazing soundtrack. A must see for any Sci-Fi,Classic film or history buff. Really, a movie that everyone should see."
1,bait and switch,"I ordered the 2010 ""restored"" version of Metropolis after viewing a film about it on cable; as per usual, Amazon's poor resellers sold and shipped me a 1984 version complete with added music---NOT what I ordered at all!!!"
5,As Close to the Original as Possible,"I saw a preview of this restored version at a screening in Santa Fe, when the titles were still in German and the last reel was still being worked on. This really is a labor of love. Placeholders describe the scenes that are probably forever lost (nearly a quarter of the original). Everything is finally in the correct sequence, and the film's never looked better. I'm looking forward to the DVD so I can re-experience this taste of what is almost a lost film."
5,A must see,"This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. Walked into a theatre on a hot day in 1984 and was mesmerized by this film. This is the perfect example of film as art. And I believe Giorgio Moroder put the perfect musical score into this updated version. Have seen the original film, but somehow Moroder's version seems succinct and he has perfectly infused rock and roll music to the scenes and emotions of the film. I could watch this film over and over again and never get tired of it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone -- maybe especially film students. Watch and enjoy."
1,Great Movie--Painfully bad transfer.,"Metropolis is one of the greatest movies of all time. Visually, it is still ripped off almost on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this DVD version is agonizing to watch. I lasted about 20 seconds and the disc was stored away. Hopefully someone will release a copy with both ""traditional"" and Georgio Moroder soundtracks. A perfect opportunity to utilize the capabilities of DVD"
2,"Metropolis: Excellent Movie, Horrible DVD","Metropolis is one of the all-time great films, that goes without saying. It is a well crafted story of opression of the working class when cold-hearted capitalism takes hold. What really impresses me about this film though, is the wonderful sets, which are very advanced for its day.The DVD of Metropolis on the other hand, doesn't do the film justice. The print is often so scratchy it is not exactly clear what is going on. If you cannot find a copy of this film anywhere else go ahead and get this. Only if a better copy can't be found though, because a clearer print would be worth the money. By way of extra features, this DVD only has one worth mentioning. This is the trivia game. At the end of the film there is a multiple choice game that asks questions about the content of the film. It's amusing, but only the first time you play it."
2,Seen Better,Having brought Metropolis Redux i thourght the picture would be as good but it is rubbish reading the back of this DVD they know of this print but did not use it i don't know why.Now for the plus side the 5.1 is great so are the special features if they had put the two together i would of given this DVD 5 stars.
2,such poor physicality,"I regret two things: 1- prior to my purchase not reading other user reviews which stated about the poor recording quality of the DVD, 2- rating such a masterpiece 2 stars only because of its poor quality.I agree with all the other people who commented on the unacceptable quality of the image you get. It is out of focus, crops the sides of the frame (I guess that one can see not more than the 70% of the whole frame area) and sctatchy. Producing and marketing such a DVD is a sheer disrespect to a masterpiece like Metropolis."
4,The awsome book Helen keller,"The book is awesome because it was about Helen Keller. She was blind,deaf and could not talk. It was Helen Keller's birthday, and she went to go eat some cake and her mom took the cake away from her. And she went running outside and she fell and hurt her self with thorns. Then Helen Keller went with this teacher so they can show her. And at the end she could hear and she was not deaf and she could talk.I thik the author tride to tell us that it dosent mater if your blind deaf and could not talk. You still count the same And he tride to tell us that don't be embbarresed if you can't talk.I think that it was a good book. Because it tells you about alot of things. And like I said it explains very good and sugest you read the book Helen Keller.IT'S THE BEST"
2,Croatian Holocaust Revisionism,"A shocking book based on little academic historical research, but rather manufactured revisionist history. Croatia, which was likely Hitler's greatest Nazi ally and conducted a brutal Holocaust against its Jewish and Serb minorities a mere fifty years ago, is according to McAdam one of the West's greatest allies and victims. McAdam's next ""work"" will likely be on how Nazi German death camps were actually work and rehabilitation centers for Jews!A shoddy work of little historical substance.A review of the Holocaust and Croatia's horrid role can be found in any library and will provide a reader with a very different perspective."
4,Good Articles,"Playboy Magazine (June 2008) is 148 pages and comes with some great articles. I like reading The Black KKK, The End of Newspapers and The End is Near: The Future of the Internet Probably Won't Be as Bright as We Think. I though the interview with Steve Carell cool and funny at times. Another article I found useful was 46 Things You Never Knew About Call Girls. I was split over the pictorials however, Juliette Frette (June 2008 Playmate and Jayde Nicole (2008 Playmate of the Year) were good; A Night at the Crazy Horse and Carla Bruni bombed. Carla Bruni only was on one page and was not even nude and the Crazy Horse gals could have more pictorials. Playboy Magazine (June 2008) gets a B+."
3,Solid album...few memorable hits,Billy has become iconic for his stage presence and longevity from the 80s...this album gives a few of his best hits and solid representation of the rocker.
5,Where The Full Length Movie?,Where Is Flaco The Wall Graffiti? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
5,Gift,"Gave this as a gift for Christmas - really don't know what the person thought about it, but I am sure it will be OK>"
3,Fell a little short of expectation,"Not as funny as the prequels. These two make a great team on screen, though. It's another installment. Unfortunately;that's all."
2,So So...,I thought this movie had a lot of potential but it is another case of the special effects and CGI being more important than the story line. I thought it was kind of boring.
3,Men In black,"One of the better in the series of the trilogy. Worth the price of the rental. Good movie, and great ending."
3,Yes it's the third one,Same old same old but does have funny moments. If you liked the others you'll probably like this fine but it was nothing special.
4,"Starts slow, but picks up!","We rented this movie based on the reviews, and at first it seemed like it was kind of a dud. But after they set up the storyline, it really takes off! Very enjoyable!"
1,Picture quality worse than SD,Amazon picture quality horrible on this night. Considering asking for my money back. Movie had good story though. Would be good in true HD.
1,Didn't Get Past the First Ten Minutes,"Of the hundreds of movies that I've seen in my 38 years, I've rarely met one where I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. Men in Black 3 was so utterly gross and stupid that we gave up after about six minutes."
1,"Movie okay, delivery abysmal",What we could see and hear of the movie was okay but most of it was so fuzzy and pixelated as to be almost unwatchable. Kudos to Amazon customer support for refunding my rental fee. I used it to rent another Amazon movie the next night that played flawlessly.
2,bad movie,stupid movie. no action and horrible plot. horrible acting. will smith has lost it. would not waste my time. boring
3,Not as good as the first two.,"Was okay, just not as good as the first two. Did have a surprising twist at the end, which is why I gave it three stars."
4,It good!,These guys are great actors. Without them this movie would maybe suck. Who else could play the part? Who Else?
1,A huge let-down,This movie was a huge let-down. The jokes are bad and the story is hard to follow and seemed like little thought was put into creating a compelling story. I was really looking forward to this movie because I thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments. This one had real potential because of it taking place in 1969. There were real possibilities of humor that was missed due to a lack of imagination on the part of the writers.
3,Decent Flick,"Nothing ground breaking. But what would you expect for a third sequel. Had a few laughs, fairly predictable plot. Not bad while on sale."
4,I enjoyed this movie,"This movie was very enjoyable, made me laugh, and considering its a trilogy I have to say they did a great job, usually in my experience alot of times movies dont hold up by time the 3rd one comes out, I think they did a great job of continueing in the Men in Black tradition."
3,Okay,"Not as good as the first two, the second one was the best, but worth watching, love the thought that goes into the creation of the movies."
4,pleasantly surprised,I really enjoyed this! As good as the 1st movie and leaps and bounds better then the 2nd. It doesn't have as much of Tommy Lee as I would have liked but Josh Brolin did a fantastic job.
3,doesnt fit original story,"ok movie, but i didn't find it very funny.story had way to many contradictions with he other movies.story didn't fit"
3,it was ok,"Not as good as the first, but definitely better than part 2. Storied moved slow until towards the end. Will smith looked like he did in Pursuit of happiness"
3,Will Wonders,"Will Smith's character J wonders how Tommy Lee Jones's character K got so ornery, but he finds out it is because of a weight K bears for J's safety that he has carried for a long time. This is a touching storyline that shows that K and J have a longer history together than J thinks. The aliens in this one are interesting and more developed psychologically than the aliens in the first two MIB movies."
4,Best Men in Black yet!,"Josh Brolin was great as Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K). I would recommend this movie, even if you didn't love the first two in the series."
4,A fun movie...,"...if you like formula movies, you will not be disappointed in this third installment of the MIB series. Aside from a few plot points which appear to be unexplained even within the context of the movie, it is still an enjoyable, light-weight bit of entertainment."
4,Great movie but too much profanity,Watched the movie with my 7 year old and I forget it was PG-13. The aliens featured was fun to watch but the violence was high alone with a fair amount of profanityBuyer beware of child's age
3,Another Men in Black Movie,"Very cute, Josh Brolin does a great job as K, He even looks like a young K, who would they get for a young J in Men in Black 4"
4,Best of Black,This is certainly one of the best MIB movies I have seen. It certainly is better than the second movie (which I liked) and is as good or better than the first MIB. Good Fun!
3,OK,"Movie was predictable, but funny in spots. The combination of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones works, even if it is old jokes."
4,I loved the ending!!,"I must say I was a little disappointed with the movie at first. However, with that being said, I loved the ending of the movie."
4,Not for young kids,"I wished there was less foul language, but the storyline was very good. It was entertaining throughout! It would be beneficial to have seen the previous MIBs."
4,Pretty good movie,"Great to buy movies through Amazon, where I can pay less for the same product. I'm always scanning at the store into my Amazon app on my phone to find out that I can just buy from home. I add to my cart through the app, and then buy after I've added all the movies (in this case) that I want.This was a decent movie, and myself and my family all thought it was better than MIB 2. I would recommend it."
2,don't bother buying it,I didn't have time to go see it in the theater so I was excited when it came up for purchase. What a disappointment. Gathered up the kids and the popcorn then fell asleep twice watching it. Save your money for something else.
3,Better than I thought it would be,"I seen the previous two MIB movies so I thought I might as well watch the third. A lot of the time the third movie falls way short. This one was no blockbuster, but it did not fall short either. I thought the movie stayed true to the core of the rest of the MIB movies without getting to crazy or turning into a back to the future movie. It also did not go into some long winded discussion about not bumping into someone you know or the fabric of time will rip.This movie is a good time waster so rentable, and if you are into the MIB series enough buyable, not for me though."
1,"May Day, May Day","this has got to be the worst movie Will Smith has done. my wife & i were DRUNK sleep (she fell out within the first 7 min) throughout nearly the entire movie; although quite hilarious, the trailer was ... it turned out to be a grave disappointmentsorry will smith fans (especially you women); i am one also, however."
2,Just another sequel,Special effects are top notch but other than that it is just Okay. i think it lacked the fresh humor of the original.
3,glad we didn't buy it,glad we didn't buy the movie and rented it first. it's a great watch but not one to own. there is nothing outstanding about it that would make me want to see it again
5,Excellent,Very funny movie could not stop laughing. Jones and smith are a perfect pair. I will be buying this movie asap!!!
4,Fun as usual,"Very fun movie. I needed to see something light and funny. It was also a bit touching in parts, which makes it a winner in my book."
5,Good Movie,I agree with other reviewers that this was a good movie. Watch it and see for yourself. Men In Black 3
1,"Loved the movie, hate ultraviolet!","Don't get me wrong, I found this installment in the MIB franchise probably to be the best one yet. However, I hate seeing the dreaded ""Ultraviolet"" download. While I understand trying to protect their product from piracy, obviously I purchased it, I'm not the bad guy, I paid for my copy and I should not have to download and additional app or program to use something that I paid for. I figure if enough people leave bad reviews maybe it will change (it did for the Harry Potter followers)and the rant was worth the effort if it did."
4,Did Not Disappoint,"Sequels are never as good as the original, but this did not disappoint. It is always interesting how they make science and technology available today appear to be 'way out!!!'"
2,Weak!,"Didn't laugh, crack a smile...nothing! Don't waste your time with this weak remake. Don't have anything more to say about this dog!"
4,Not a bad follow-up,"I doubt there will be a 4th movie. This was about a 7 on a 10 scale. Special effects are good, humor is not as present as previous movies. The ending, I thought, is the best part."
4,pretty good movie,"this is a pretty decent movie - it goes to another level with time travel this time, but overall I thought it was cool, and continued the same theme/feel as the first two. My favorite moment is in the beginning, the funeral speech held by agent K."
2,Men In Black In HD - Terrible,"What a boring disappointment, not to mention incredibly poor resolution for a ""HD"" movie ...... they should have left MIB alone with the first 2. Don't wast your time or money."
5,less puffy eyes,Had been looking for a caffeine eye treatment---finally found it. After just a few days I can see & feel the difference. I will keep using it.
2,boring,Typical boring Hollywood shoot 'em up. One dimensional characters with big guns. Each scene is a repeat of the previous.
2,QUality,The quality of the video was not good.Perhaps need to have the regular version and not HD in the future.
3,A let dwo in some ways,So much has gone into MIB1 and 2 It seemed it lack the luster and creativity of the previous films. Boring at times even...
4,Good but not as good as the first two,"I liked Will Smith but the synergy between Smith and the younger Jones was not there like it is between the older one and him. In the past the creature characters had a good vibe to them, there was some good and bad, funny and not so but all and all rounded toward the overall feel of the story. This one was overall just a bit darker in feel and the creatures rounded toward that. Too much drama.I have seen all the previous ones (and have the DVDs) but will probably not buy this one.If you loved the first two you will like this one, if not it will not improve your feelings about them."
5,Great fun movie,My husband & I truly enjoyed this movie. Josh Brolin was an excellent young Tommy Lee Jones. Lots of fun and action and comedy. Good sequel/prequel.
2,Brolin was great,"Brolin had 1969 K. down. Other than that, I was bored. I laughed out loud...once. Maybe an ok rental. Yawn."
3,Great cast and characters seeking a bigger plot.,"I love the Men in Black concept but i believe Will Smith is too awesome to be in this half good, half bad movie. I loved the first movie it was flawless but greatness doesnt deserve this type of treatment and they could of done better in part 3. Writers need to stick with what works. Better writing less CGI. See it then buy it. You may want it just for WILL SMITH."
3,"Walk, don't run for this sequel","sequels of successful movies are often not so good. This was the case with MIB 3. As before, the special effects are fun, but the story line is getting tired, ""been there, done that""."
5,Great Movie,"Perhaps not as hilarious as the first two, but quite enjoyable! The streaming video was flawless. We really like being able to start the movies anytime and pause and resume."
4,MIB3,"Fairly entertaining, sometimes the plot is a little silly, such as climbing to the top of an ""about to launch"" Saturn 5 moon rocket, and jumping off of a skyscraper to travel in time. I hope there will be a MIB4."
5,Best MIB Movie Yet,"We just streamed this movie in HD last weekend and loved it. By far the best of the three movies in this series, with the fantastic music, action, and special effects you would expect, plus an intriguing and internally-consistent story line that makes it more than just the usual eye candy. Definitely worth the price of the rental!"
4,Leagues better than I expected.,"With the amount of sequals that are just thrown together these days I was very wary of MIB3 but there I was Saturday evening looking at Amazon Instant Videos, so I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. A fun story that didn't drag."
5,Excellent conclusion to a great series,This was an excellent film to wrap up the Men In Black franshise but I would still like to see another after this one.
1,movie kept dropping signal,no problem with my internet but this movie kept dropping and reloading made it hard to watch second movie in two days that did this
1,didnt play right,movie stopped playing 30 min before the end and was skipping throughout this was a terrible movie experience.you owe me a new movie or something
1,UV is really messed up!!!,"This review is about Ultraviolet not the movie. I just purchased the combo pack with UV, and as an added ""bonus"" for me was that the package indicated a downloadable copy (no further details). What this actually means is that you must have Flixster or VUDU in order to access this feature or the ""download"" the movie.If you loved the movie, which is the primary reason I purchased this product, then you already know what you are getting, but do not be fooled by the ""download"" label on the package thinking it is compatible with iTunes or any other app."
4,Fun movie,Fun movie! It's not trying to be an Oscar contender... My wife and I enjoyed it for a simple fun movie night at home.
2,Picture quality,Our family loves this movie and was so glad to see it again. We rented the movie in HD but the picture quality was more like analog. The picture was choppy and pixelated. We watched it twice and the picture was worse the second time viewed.We still love the movie.....
4,As Good,"This movie was almost as good as the first MIB, and definitely better than the second! It was enjoyable to watch! :)"
4,MBIII more of the same,Some of the effects in this movie seem like rehashes of the first two however it did have flashes of entertaining moments. This movie did have an insightful ending. The ending does have a sense of closure about it. Hopefully the producers leave it at that and do not turn this into a Rambo or Rocky type of scenario. Three of these is enough.
2,Not impressed,I kept falling asleep during the movie....that should tell you something. The reveal at the end was sort of poignant though and I felt that Josh Brolin was a believable young agent K. The first Men In black was definitely the best. They should have quit when they were ahead.
5,Very Funny,James Brolin did a great job as young K he was totally believable . If you liked the other two you will love this one too.
1,i HATE this clock radio!,"Perfect clock for masochists! The ""Lock/Wake 1, Wake 2,Time""button is hard to slide back and forth! What the heck is Wake 1 and Wake 2 anyway? You have to reset the alarm for weekend mornings or you're waking up at the pre-set weekday alarm time because there's no way to shut it off! Oh, and what's this whole ""nap"" button doing right next to the snooze button? Because if you want to snooze, you can hit either button, but if you hit Nap and mess with the nap minutes at all cause you're in a fog from having to wake up to go to that freakin' job you freakin' hate, you'll be snoozing for another MINUTE instead of the ten minutes you needed to defog! It's mean, just plain mean. And if the electronics engineer who designed this thing was standing here right now, this clock would be a part of his face right now! I hope everyone got a good laugh out of my diatribe/venting here...but, jeeze, this clock! I HATE it!"
4,Great little clock,"Overall this clock is just what I wanted... pretty small as most cheaper clocks are... but with good features. It's got a great buzzer that will gently wake you from a sound sleep, instead of sounding like something out of an 80s movie. The LED display is bright enough, without overpowering you. And it has 2 alarms! My only complaint is the buttons could be laid out a little better... and to set the time is a bit of a pain... no separate buttons for hour and minutes. But if you don't mind that, for the price you can't beat this clock."
4,a small but suprising film,I only watched late at night but for some reason I would only catch the last part but when finally I saw it from beginning to end I was truly suprised and fascinated because this is another part of christianity that nobody talked about What if someone was trying to destroy Christ's last actions by telling everyone it was a fraud? While it seems strange and kind of unnerving to see it from the evil side point of view you also find astounding on how he fails completely.So add it to your collection it is worht it.
4,Worth A Look!,"Very interesting story from the perspective of a Roman. (Though I already own this film on vhs, I do wish it was on dvd!)"
3,Short but sweet,"I have a California King mattress that is several years old. I was hoping to prolong purchasing a new mattress by installing this pad. While the pad is comfortable and very dense, it is several inches shorter than the mattress so either your head or your feet are not supported by the pad."
5,Very happy with purchase,"I strained my back muscles recently so picked this up from Amazon after seeing all the positive reviews. I couldn't be happier with it. The size was just right, fit over my current mattress no problems. I didn't notice any weird smells, I sleep well on it. Overall very, very happy with the purchase. I've already recommended it to my cousin with a back problem and I'll probably buy another one for my brother."
1,Smelly and Ineffective,"The first thing I noticed was how the item was packaged. No product information or instructions, just the item all wrapped up in plastic.Second thing I noticed was the smell. It has a chemical like smell that lingers.I decided to give it a go anyhow. We slept on it for a week and I think my back and neck hurt more than ever before. Definitely didn't improve my sleep experience.I'm not sure why other people are giving it such high reviews. I think you could buy yourself an egg crate for 1/4 the price and get the same results.I don't recommend this product."
1,Bad odor,This foam mattress cover has a very bad odor. I tried to contact them at info@sleepquestions.net but could not find them thru google
2,Regret buying,"Bought this with high hopes.I do not understand all the positive reviews. At least, what I received does not feel like memory foam at all. It feels like regular sponge which springs back after you press your hand on it. I waited too long to test it out. It had very strong minty odor when I received it. I left open it in a room in the basement to air out. Took more than a month to loose the smell. When I tried to use it, it did not feel like memory foam I have seen at friends homes. Then I tried basic pressing hand test. I press it and let my hand go, foam springs back to original shape immedately. Feels like regular sponge.I have a suspicion, they may not be shipping the same item to everybody. But, it is too late to return. I will swallow the loss."
5,WOW!!!,I don't normally write reviews but I had to for this product. This thing is amazing. Every evening I look forward to getting into bed. My wife and I both have found it very difficult to get out of the bed in the mornings. If you are on the fence about it....buy it. You wont regret the purchase.
1,beware : very strong smell,I am going to try to pack these up. The smell is very strong. I am worried the chemicals on it are toxic. They are in an upstairs bedroom but I can smell them downstairs and totally in the other side of the house. I can not even believe how strong the smell is. I actually felt a burning in my nose when near them. They have been unwrapped for several hours and the smell has not lessened.
4,like my new memory foam topper!,"I have a very firm mattress and to 'soften' it up I bought this topper. It arrived as stated and provides the comfort/support I was hoping for. No smell after first day, good density. I hope it has good longevity."
5,Sleeps GREAT,We bought a low end mattress and this to put on top. It now sleeps better than our mid range mattress for much less. Highly recommened.
5,Makes my hard mattress so cozy,I bought this topper to go on my guest bed. The mattress is quite firm. With this topper it is now luxurious. I sleep better in the guest bed than on my 5k mattress in my master. I would recommend especially for the price.
1,Seems like a bait and switch,Not as advertised . Do not be fooled by the reviews. Check out the recent reviews. Waste of you time.
2,Not super impressed,This mattress topper was okay for the money I guess. It doesn't look very high quality as it's kind of discolored and the edge is kind of jagged. It's relatively comfortable and for my purposes (which was a way to buy time with my current mattress until I buy a new one) it works but ideally it wasn't what I had hoped for. If it weren't so big & bulky & hard to package back up I probably would have returned it because of the lack of quality.
4,A mattress enhancer that does enhance sleep,"This mattress ""enhancer"" lives up to it's billing. I found that the odor was noticably less bothersome than other memory foam mattress toppers, and it does keep it's shape unlike the other topper I tried and returned. I should note that I did not put this topper on my bed until after airing it thoroughly--it says it can be used right away, but I am highly sensitive to chemicals/odors so played it safe. While it's not a panacea for all sleep ills, the mattress topper definitely makes sleep more comfortable--no more tossing and turning, and it does give relief from pressure points. My regular queen mattress pad fits snugly over the topper, and I have not had any problems with it being too hot. I actually think three inches would have been overkill, and find the two inches just perfect. All in all, a good investment."
4,Good buy.,"At first, the topper was stiff and had an unpleasant and strong odor. However, after letting it relax for a few days, the memory foam really softened up and the odor disappeared, so hang in there. All in all very pleased. We got it to go on top of an air mattress for guests, and so far, our guests are singing the praises of the whole set up."
5,Love this,I am so pleased with this memory foam mattress topper. We recently purchased an extra firm mattress that is too firm for us. This makes the mattress so comfortable.
4,Works Ok,"I found this foam topper to be nice at first, but didn't make a huge difference after awhile. Expensive for what you get, but still probably the best memory foam mattress topper you can find."
4,Comfortable but not really a memory foam,"Delivery with Super Saver was very quick - only 2 business days. The mattress is very comfortable and the smell is not too bad at all. My only criticism is that this is not a memory foam - it bounces back to shape immediately, so can't be regarded as memory foam. Nevertheless, I recommend it."
5,Heaven,"If you're looking for a way to make your bed amazingly soft and comfortable, this mattress pad will do the trick! It's hard to wake up in the morning these days. I've only had the pad for about a week, so I can't speak to its longevity, and the green tea smell they infuse the pad with to drown out that weird tempur pedic smell is a wee bit strong -- but really no major complaints!"
3,Weird After Effects,"Wow, received this pad super fast. I let it air out for 2 days, put it on the bed and it was so very comfy. After approx. 5 weeks I pulled off the mattress cover that I was using as protection for it and the foam pad had weird discolorations all over it, especially along the edges. Kind of an egg yolk yellow and an odd oily sheen to it. Very strange and not sure how healthy something like that can be for you. Needless to say, I am no longer using it. It was past my return window when I called Amazon and they were helpful in resolving the issue. PLEASE NOTE, there was no info regarding how to clean these types of toppers or even if you can. It seems to me that should be a concern or consideration. However you chose to look at it."
2,No memory,"Product title is misleading. This should not be called a memory foam topper. It is just foam. If you push down on it with your hand, it doesn't leave any imprint. Not even for a split second. I wish I had spent more for real memory foam."
1,Bait and Switch- Not same Mattress Pad,"I bought 2 of these ""identical"" pads.One was a Queen and one a Cali King.1st -- Both arrived in utterly beaten up boxes (both wide open upon delivery -- not very comforting when you're planning on sleeping on the contents...)2nd -- They were COMPLETELY different mattresses.The Queen was real memory foam (with a tear from shipping.The Cali King was a piece of cheap foam. NO memory quality whatsoever.Night and day difference between the exact ""same"" product in different sizes.Amazon-- busted.Refunds will hopefully be processed fast."
1,"Not Memory Foam, Do Not Buy","Please see other most recent reviews, this is a regular (overpriced) foam mattress. There is NO handprint indentation, none. Like most other people have said, it's fine if that's all you want but dishonest to call it ""memory foam""."
3,It's lighter than description,"Upon arrival, the package was felt quite light, so I weighted it. It's only 14 pounds. That's much less than the claimed 19-pound shipping weight. so be aware. Otherwise, the product is OK, does have memory foam feel, although don't know how long it would last (typically the heavier ones would last longer)."
1,Deception,"This products big selling point was that it was memory foam. I have worked in constuction for many years and know what memory foam is, there is no memory of any kind to this foam. This was a complete rip off, and I will not deal with this manufacturer ever again."
1,Vent hole potential stressers,"Vent holes in foam about [21] have 1/4"" linear horizontal depressions near holes that appears to be a stress point that can eventually tear during use. No manufacturer quality control ticket in product package. Package came with 1 insert [Use/care of the memory foam mattress topper, caution!, 2 year limited warranty information]. Returning item for credit due to defect."
4,"Good pad. Good Price, not perfect.","It's not the best foam pad in the world, and there are many that I've slept on where I just sunk into them and was ready for sleep. This is not that kind of pad, but it will take off the hardness or unevenness of an old mattress. On the old mattress I am sleeping on now it made the difference between tossing and turning and actually falling asleep, so for me it was well worth the price."
1,dont waste your money,"Bought this for a youth shoot at our club...thing just wouldnt work right. I tried to adjust per directions, and it had no impact. Targets wouldnt swing all the way from one side to the other. I ended up tearing it apart and making hanging swinging targets out of the ""arms"". Dont bother with this unit.Raleigh NC"
1,dont use a .22 with this.,"This target was definitely not designed for a low energy bullet like a .22. The springs that flip the Target from one side to the other are strong enough that it takes 2 hands (1 to flip the Target, 1 to hang onto the stand) to flip the targets. The tension is adjustable but not enough to make any difference. It's now laying on the work bench while I decide if I can build something better or just throw it in the scrap pile."
1,This Dude Was Nothing But A Wanksta,"No real rhyming skills at all. The reason why he was so popular is because he was different than what was already out there. He was rico suave for one hot minute and then he become pobre estupido the next. No one even remembers who he is. Someone told me Gerardo paved the way for Pitt Bull, but I don't know about that."
3,Ok if your baby doesn't move in his/her sleep,"My 2 month old daughter battles with congestion. I was told the only things I can do were saline solution, use a humidifier and have the baby sleep elevated. The Nap Nanny is ideal but 1. It has been recalled and 2. Even if you ignore the recall you can only use the Nap Nanny for up to four months. So I bought this product in hopes of having my daughter in her crib.I use it along with the humidifier. The first few nights it worked fine. But my baby moves around in her sleep so she manages to slide off in the night. Coincidently she has not slept thru the night for the last three days.I'm sure it works for others, and maybe there is still hope for us, but for now I'd rate it as just ok."
1,sids,i did not get this product from this website but a similar item was given to me as a present Thank goodness i didn't use it because it was recalled. Babies were rolling over and suffocating. Just wanted to pass on the warning
1,Baby Slides Off,"My daughter has reflux and we purchased this wedge in the hopes that she'd be comfortable sleeping on her back in the crib while slightly elevated. This is not helpful. We placed it under her sheets and mattress cover but all my daughter did was slide right down or off to the side. You can probably get the same effect from strategically folding towels. I wouldn't recommend this to help your baby with reflux sleep.Ultimately, we purchased the the Fisher Price Rock 'n Play for our daughter instead after reading a bunch of reviews from parents with refluxy babies and our daughter LOVES it. It sits at an angle, cuddles the child's sides, and allows you to physically rock the baby back and forth as she goes to sleep. Unhappily, our girl loves it so much that she's still sleeping in it at 8 months and we can't figure out how to get her to a crib -- but the wedge isn't the way to do it."
5,My baby's best night's sleep!,"This is a one-piece wedge that is ready to use right out of the box. There is no assembly, buttons, zippers, or anything else a couple of people have mentioned. Our baby girl would only sleep in her bouncy seat, which we had to place on the floor by my side of the bed. She absolutely would not sleep for more than five minutes laying flat on her back in her crib. After reading all the horrible reviews on the expensive incline sleep positioners, which lay completely flat because it doesn't support a baby's weight, we gave the Safe Lift Deluxe Crib Wedge a try. I bought this from Toys R Us and she slept through the night in her nursery. In fact, she's napping in it now! I'm already recommending this to all my new mommy friends."
5,Excellent!,"An anthology of Mencken's newspaper reports and analyses on politics between 1920 and 1936. Most of them, I think, do not appear in any of the other various Mencken anthologies. They are written in lucid and musical prose, full of refreshing honesty and vigor."
3,Electric Razor,"Got the product in a timely manner, but it does not perform well. No close shaves!!!!!!!!"
2,Bad Shaver,"Just doesn't shave well in or out of the shower. It didn't matter how much or how little shaving cream was used with this shaver, it just doesn't work well."
1,good for a museum only. it doesnt shave!!!,this shaver doesn't shave and you have to shave it for 8 hours to sue it a little. every two days you have to change the blade. you have to keep scratching it against your skin to shave a little.DONT BUY IT!!
3,Works Good on short stubble,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We saw it was a best buy from Consumer Reports. The price was great. My husband does not think it works well if he does not shave every day.
1,Utterly useless,"I bought this in desperation while traveling. I could not get this to shave one whisker. It's really an amazing feat. Do Not Buy This Product.The sideburn trimmer works fine, so I give it one star."
1,junk,"Needed a replacement for my cheapo Braun that lasted for more than 8ys but no longer held a charge. What a POS this is starting with the adapter to charge. Who came up with this design? No indicator for fully charged or not. The cutting power is pathetic, I didnt think that is was fully charged the 1st time using. After a few weeks, tore the foil because I need to apply so much pressure to get a ""close"" shave. The replacement costs of the foil nearly as much as the shaver itself. No thanks. I spent a few more bucks and just got the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve, far superior."
2,Not what I was expecting!,I don't know if its my hair or the machine is not strong enough but this does not work for me.
2,Easy to use but not a close shave,"It comes with everything you need; it's easy to use and gentle on the face. But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas. I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close shave.I see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave- It must depend on what you're used to. This was my first experience with an electric shaver. I normally use a 5 blade ""sensor"" hand held razor so maybe my idea of a close shave is different from what you look for in an electric model.Anyway, it is easy to use."
2,Rip Off,"Buyer beware: I purchased this for my teen son and it doesn't work like I thought it would. The trimmer works great, but the actual shaver part doesn't cut at all. He will stick with the disposable razors."
3,OK with stubble- not OK with wet or 2 day beard,I only have this 3 weeks so maybe it is premature. But not as good as other razors I have hadmainly due to poorness with 2-3 day beards. Tried in shower with shaving cream and did not work well
3,"Works well on day-old beards, not so much on anything longer","If you shave every day it provides a pretty good shave and the ability to go ""wet"" is a nice option. If you wait longer than a day to shave, it doesn't work well at all and leaves a lot of hairs behind no matter how many times you go over them."
2,Not Ok,This Panasonic shaver doesn't perform as expected. This shaves partially not removing all the hairs and results with little scratchs on the face.
1,Disappointment,Glad you asked. Am going to discard as it wouldn't pay to go through the trouble of returning. Have ordered inflatable hangers before and they have been perfect. The four packs (2 each) this time cannot be inflated. They are stuck together and must have been in stock a long time. Sorry. Will try another source. I only rated one star simply to get off of this page!
4,Not as advertised,I liked them. But unfortunately I had to return them because they advertised 4 hangers for the price and I only recieved 2! So I am still without inflatable hangers. I'll have to look for another vendor. Dissappointed LK
5,Good Quality Nut Driver,I bought the tool for a specific repair work and I used it for a few days only. I enjoyed using it. The handle provided non slip grip and is just right in size. Chrome coating is without defects and was not scratched while I worked with the tool. Magnetic head was very useful and kept nuts inside the tool even when the tool was incidentally bumped against the metal case of the device I was repairing. The hollow shaft was useful to tighten up nuts when the bolts were long. I am sure I will use it again and I am going to keep it in the top drawer of my tool box. The tool looks and feels like the tools I used to have when they were made in US.
3,Decent,"I went out and bought this CD after hearing the song ""If You're Gonna Leave"" on the radio. I was hoping the CD would have more songs like this one. Overall, the CD is good. I like half the songs and the other half I can live without. They just don't do much for me and leave me feeling a little bland."
1,Galangal Powder - lacking in flavor and aroma,I was disappointed at the flavor and smell of this product. It lacks the characteristics that the fresh root has and therefore is not a good substitute for fresh galangal.
2,A little dissapointed,"I was expecting a more challenging Cd, something with more bite or, in this case more sting, but instead it's a rather dull, easy listening CD with only snippets of true Yellowjackets' genius. If you are a fan of their more adventourus stuff, and playing in odd time signatures really isn't that impressive if you can't feel the music, you will be disappointed."
2,As big as my Chevy Truck,"While the TI 92 does just about everything. As an engineering teacher, I like the 89 much better because it is much smaller."
2,Good Premise but.......DOH!!!!!,Started reading Sleeper with high expectations. It seemed like the perfect book for my daily 2.5 hour commute home from work. The premise of a creature running amok in the Pentagon ripping people to shreds is too good to pass up. However towards the half way mark it became obvious (painfully so) what the plot twist was and how the book was going to end. I could not believe that the author was moving the story in this direction. Why? to what purpose? (I Don't want to give anything away) It started off great and it ended rather badly. Give it a try you might like dumb plot twists.
2,Is this book great? Uhhh.......NO!,"I really do not understand the hoopla that this book has gotten. It's formulaic, the characters are nothing more than cardboard copies of the same characters (beautiful single scientist, Rambo wannabe, man who has GHOSTS IN THE PAST to deal with) that you'd find in most books and movies similar to this. As a matter of fact, the plot and characters rip off a book called Hunter by James Byron Huggins a bit TOO MUCH for my liking. Anyway, if you want a predictable read with chintzy writing and an unbelievably hokey ending, pick this up. For the 95 percent of you that want to read something worth your time, give this a pass.Not recommended."
2,government propaganda packed in a horror story,"I thought the story was good, but barely kept back the bile on the unabashed propaganda about the inner workings (and what they do for us average civilians) of the pentagon."
4,A nice family movie,"This movie is nice for the family. It's a different version than the one I thought I was getting (my own fault). I was unsure which one was ""the right"" one. It's still a nice movie though, a little slow-moving at times and a bit stuffy, but still nice for kids."
4,The Lost Realms,"Another great book by Zachariah Sitchen, I have read all eight books of his Earth chronicles and they are all very mind boggling."
4,Aztecs and Aliens,"Sitchin picks up where he left off, this time adding ancient American mythology and archaeology into his thesis: that Earth was long ago visited by aliens from a tenth planet, that those aliens created Man as we know him, that they are the Gods of olden times. Drawing parallels between the mythologies of the Mayans, Aztecs, Inca, and the peoples of the ancient Middle East, he suggests that the Native Americans were of Cain's line (Tenochitlan = Enochitlan), that the earliest post-diluvial civilizations were established by the same beings that established all other original civilizations, and so on. It's a fun read."
3,An understanding of the Americas deep history.,"Sitchin's expertise is in the linguistics of Sumer and the MiddleEast. Yet in LOST REALMS he displays an unusual grasp of ancientarchaeology in the Americas. However, he fails to substanially advancehis case that extraterrestrial intervention planted the seeds ofEarth's civilizations."
5,"""The Secret Agent"" by Philip Glass","This, in my humble opinion, is one of Glass' most ingenoius works. Set to the athmospheric surreality of 19th century london, this album seamlessly juxtaposes traditional melodic harmonies with colorations that are distinctively Glass. I ould recommend this record to any audionphile or Glass aficionado"
2,Lame dialogue leading to anticlimax,"Features include annoying main character with lame stilted dialogue (eventually I just clicked through all speech, of which there's tons) and unbelievable character actions. Simple linear game play. Main menu hides in the upper right hand corner - have to hover over it a while, or you'll never get out because the escape key does nothing. I quickly looked up a walkthrough so I could just get on with seeing the semi-pretty pictures and be done with it.It's a good game if you like to go back and forth asking a guy for a bucket of water. There were a couple clever puzzles."
2,Horrible acting,Often graphics and screen shots sell games and the graphics in this are very nice. Unfortunately the voice acting is so horrendously bad that it makes the whole game truly laughable. The main character reads his lines like a DJ reading off the evening news. Some of the ridiculous forced accents are equally terrible. It's like they dug up a few folks from around the neighborhood to do the voices and some have no idea what a German or French accent is supposed to sounds like. I can't get over it...ruins the whole game.
2,Just Terrible,"After the above average yet poppy ""Soldier of Fortune"" album with Mike Vescera, things were looking good for loudness.Then they released ""On the Prowl"".This album is a self cover album (UGH) with rearranged music and rearranged lyrics of loudness masterpeices! Just listen to how butchered ""To be Demon"" is(the butcerhed version is ""find a way"").The first 3 tracks are new songs, but honestly they are not that good. I actully like how Masaki sings ""down n dirty"" live on ""Once and for All"" better than this studio rendition by Mike.This is by far one of the worst Loudness albums and a dark time for the group. Only get this for collection purposes, like I did.Sadly, I must give this 2 stars. I would give it 1 star, but I must say Wounded Bird remastered this album quite well. Why they remastered this album the best of their loudness catalogue is a major question to me though!"
2,Muddled Thriller,"This thriller had a few good moments but overall didn't satisfy. A man is captured in his own apartment and beaten and tormented by some right wing nut jobs trying to get him to confess to killing their leader several years earlier. Didn't quite veer into ""torture porn"" territory, but came close a few times.I thought I should feel more sympathy for the victim, but somehow just didn't care that much. The actors were either mediocre or over the top. It did have a slight twist at the end that I will not divulge here, but by then for me it was too little too late."
1,Mean Spirited Junk,"Yet despite its slick invocation of political concepts, As Good As Dead is never anything more than pop culture junk. What works about it comes mostly through its use of setting and its persistently slow pace, taking the time and care to adequately ramp up the tension. Frank Whaley turns in a competent performance as a sweet-talking sociopath with an SS neck tattoo. Otherwise you find performances equal to typical SyFy movie cast. Yet like so many contemporary thrillers, the film can't help itself from throwing in a dissatisfying last-minute twist that rips the spine out of the entire story. There were no innocents. The movie preaches a message of hate and a world that works for no one. This movie was a hugely flawed product that trades in ugliness and fear."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first chapter of the book which was what I expected the book to be about i.e. bread in one global country. As each chapter went by, the book became less about bread and more about the author forcing her personality on the reader. It was a limited collection of travelogues, many in the USA, with bread as the intended link between chapters. If you want to read a second rate travel book with something about bread in each chapter this is the book for you. If you want to read a well thought out book on comparitive breads around the world look elswhere."
4,Good quality metal,"If you want to make your own 2 inch square tube hitch of some type this 12 inch piece will work well. I would recomend a good coating of a Por15 or equivalent to be able to take the outside envronment if you are going to leave it in place on your vehicle, otherwisw just a coat of rustoleum primer and topcoat will be fine."
1,cruz juarez,"The horn is faulty because it works one time and then allowed to hear, let it off vuelvea time and work, but so it goes and not continuous operation."
3,pylepro1599AI,"This speaker sounds good with sufficient bass, the reason I gave 3stars because of the misleading power wattage, the 1600W mentioned is not that appears to be probably 100W, this speaker is good for a medium size basement and the price is rigth."
2,Another view,"Floyd Collins's score is certainly odd, but that's not enough to make me love it. Ambitious, interesting, yes, but repeated listenings have been tough, like something the teacher assigned me to do.The characters are basically Central Casting's idea of hillbillies, the story is pointless and morbid. (Compare the scintillating, gripping film Billy Wilder made from the same story and see how Guettel and his collaborators have drained the tale of drama and significance. What exactly were they trying to say? After repeated listenings I'm still not sure.)I know people like to be ""hip to the new"" and that may account for some of the baffling raves posted here, but I really wonder if all these people sincerely like this pinched, fussy, self-conscious, unmemorable, uninvolving music or if they think it's smart to pretend they like it? Are we all being honest here?"
2,Step into a dark and strange cave.,"This story of a man trapped in a cave, may be ingenious to some, but to this listener was very boring. The taste of the musical may appeal to some, but when buying this CD, do not buy with the expectations of hearing another Stephen Sondheim, Frank Wildhorn, or Jason Robert Brown. This so called ""future of musical theatre"" is definitely taking a step in a direction away from all other contemporary and developmental theatre. The lyrics are essentialy simple and not thought provoking, and the overall storyline is not great. I give this two stars, simply because I did not find the story line thought provoking or the music memorable."
2,Over-rated,"The issue I have with some of the new music of our time is that listeners are often drawn in by some musical program rather than by the music itself. When the program is one with which listeners feel some deep personal connection, such listeners then project their personal feelings and experiences onto the given music. This creates a sense of depth and connection to that music which may not actually be present. When confronted with programmatic music, I prefer to listen first, without direction, influence or the reading of liner notes, so that the music will either communicate something to me (or not). When listeners rely on whatever gloss a composer has imposed on his/her music, they may be lulled into a false belief that the music itself is profound. That is my problem here with Professor Golijov's work."
1,URBAN LEGEND 2,"What I didn't like about this movie is that all the murders weren't that good. It wasn't really scary and I already knew who the killer was from the very beggining. The thing I liked is the ""disguise"" of the killer. It was intresting. But what I also hated about the movie UL 2 is that they didn't continue with the characters like Natalie..."
1,Horrible...just horrible.,"I've been watching horror for the past 20 years, the only people who will like this are the gullible teens that like I Know What You Did Last Summer and the terrible sequel that followed. UL1 was trash and didn't deserve the hideous sequel anyway. If you want slasher, stick with the classics, Psycho, Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. Leave this in the gutter where it belongs."
3,Pre filter,"I have the rhino eq-300 whole house system and I've had nothing but problems with the pre filter. Aquasana states to change the pre filter approximately every 3 months or when you can see no more white surface. My filter turned dark brown in 2 hours of use. When I called customer service I was told the sediment in my water is not there fault and to change the filter more often. The fact is aquasana has not addressed the sediment issue properly. I have a friend who lives in a different part of the country with the same problem. If you buy this unit, be prepared the change the pre filter very often, which gets very expensive at $15 a four pack."
2,bird fountain,"It was smaller than I thought and I have had it about 1 month and the piece at the end that holds the bird fountain in the ground looks like it rusted and fell apart from the rest of the fountain. Now I just have the rest of the stake in the ground and hope it will hold, but it makes the fountain shorter. How can I get in touch with manufacturer to send me the bottom stake?"
4,I loved this CD!,When I was listening to MSN I came across it. I love Early Music and they had a Radio station that was playing it. I decided to listen to it. So as I was lisitening to it I came across the song Collected Songs Where Every Verse Is Filled With Grief. That is the besty song I ever heard in a long time. I like the other songs but this one really spoke to me. It was quite moving if I might say.
5,Good book,"Practical, insightful, easy to read. More philosophical than Mr. Dean's ""Step by Step to Stand up Comedy""- which is a good thing. Good advice for any aspiring comic."
4,"Well Done, Easy Read","This is my review of Anthony Burton's ""the Canal Builders"", published here at the third book in his trilogy by mistake.A succinct, entertaining writing of the transformation of England by the canallers, starting with Francis Egerton, who completed his Duke of Bridgewater's canal in 1761 at age 25. The peak of the Canal Age in England was 1793 which is when John Hancock subscribed $40 for the building of the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts. As a member of the Middlesex Canal Association, my understanding of the beginning of canals and the Industrial Age in America was greatly changed by reading this clearly written, short book. Specifically, England was bustling in the eighteenth century, and America built on the progress in England. I look forward to reading more of Anthony Burton's more than thirty books."
1,piece of junk,"CD player a piece of junk from the beginning--skips in the middle of a track to the next one, doesn't play at all other times. pass it by."
1,Eastern European Budget,"Well, if you want to save a lot of money and still call it a movie then rent a subway in Eastern Europe, toss in the customary burning tires, the customary artificially ripped clothing and black facial spray paint on the customary always present somewhat human - human eaters. So everybody hacks/chomps away on both sides until there is always only one - but which one. How imaginative! Who cares, get a life."
2,Not as great as it appears,"I got this hoping to avoid hitting my fingers and thumb while trying to hang pictures. While these are magnetic and hold the nail somewhat, for picture hanging, I'm better off using my fingers. This actually increased safety hazards rather than reduce them. The nail would be attracted to the magnet, but it wasn't at all strong enough to hold it tightly in place, so it would slip around when hit. I was extremely disappointed with it. Maybe it works better on flat surfaces rather than walls, but I think it would still have the issue of not being able to hold the nail perfectly still."
4,Modern quilt revival history,"Today's new quilters have no idea of the primitive beginnings and early struggles of the modern quilt revival that began in the '70's. They will enjoy reading this book about the development of new products, fabrics, ideas and activities connected to quilting, which many take for granted. We ""old timers"" will recall these early days of a ""new/old"" movement in which many women and men, not knowing they had so much creativity within, surprised themselves with a new interest that forced it to the surface. Quilting is a rewarding activity that does not seem to wane and will probably develop more amazing surprises in the future."
3,Clayhawk 3/4,"Unpacking the thrower and seeing it for the first time was a bit disappointing.The mechanism for holding the thrower in the 3/4 position is nothing more than a crude gear with a spring and a pawl. It was frozen in place by paint and what appeared to be rust.After a through cleaning and greasing I mounted it to a stand.It throws about 55-60 yards.We threw 3 cases of white flyers with it and the only problem encountered was the pivot bolt works its way loose after 20-30 throws. I ended up putting in a longer bolt and a lock nut.Also you will want to tie a string onto the pull lever because the vibration is very hard on the hands of the person doing the releasing.It is much easier to cock than a regular thrower, you simply pull it into the throw position."
1,This movie is terrible!!!!,"I'd rather stick a lit firecracker down my shorts than endure the agony that is this movie. As an actor you know your career is basically over when you go from macho action star to playing in family movies pretending to be action films. If you are a hardcore fan of chuck norris and are over the age of 8 this movie is not for you. I thought that Hellbound was the worst Chuck Norris film ever, but this one takes the cake."
2,Does not gets fully hard.,"Previously, I was using Abro Quick Steel Epoxy for my gluing needs. It dries fast, holds well, and becomes really steel-hard after cure. Now I decided to give a try to this glue. I was dissapointed.First of all, it was very hard to get a drop of it, since one of nozzles appeared to be clogged with dried epoxy. I had to use screw to remove the hardened epoxy cap.Second, while bonding properties of this glue are ok, it does not cures to fully hard condition, it remains a bit soft (soft enough that you can leave significant mark on it by using your finger nail), so it is very difficult to finish the surface - imagine you've glued some metal pieces together, then sanded whole area to receive the clean surface, then painted it, but you discover than under the paint you got the soft surface, and slight finger press can disturb it. Looks very unpleasant!"
4,Wad u might wanna know before picking it up....,"The sounds as well as the soundtrack is very reminiscent of the way the OST for FIGHT CLUB was done....The music is engaging to a first time listener, but would evoke memories if you have watched the movie....The track listings of this OST does not give away the plot or twisted ending of the movie!The OST is packaged in a Digipack, with a slit that encloses a booklet of pictures, track listings and credits. Don't look forward to understanding too much, unless u can read Korean!If you liked the film and loved the music, this is for you. If not, stick to the Movie....."
5,"""a little night moloko +""","I get home, get out of uniform, slip into droog-drag, check out the old isolation tank, and do a brain bathe with Wendy Carlos and this glorious creation of splendor.Yeah, well, we can dream - not so?I own the vinyl version of this too! Missing are tracks 8 and 9 - delightful surprise on this CD. For the kids, if you don't know from Wendy Carlos - get this one. It's very ""el differente"", put the Rap scene on hold, gangbangers don't have a clue! Walter/Wendy made the mark way back - [this is original art little brothers] - and still do.Choreographers - isn't it time for ""Clockwork Orange"" - the ballet? There's always room!Don't stop!"
3,Not satisfied,"Im going to send it back because i dont trust it it's not a name brand, and some keys wont play, and headjoint had nonremovable stains, going straight hope this helps bye."
5,Why is everything that I want so hard to find?,"I would like to know why everything that I want is so hard to find- Firehouse, Poison, Warrant, Slaughter, Baton Rouge, Vain, XYZ, Mitch Malloy, Del Amitri and Bulletboys- these are some of the artists that are hard to find.Lights out on the playground is a great album and worth buying- but I won't buy it used. I'd sooner buy it brand new and for the retail price of $16.99."
3,This is funny stuff if you stand it!,The whole CD is one big sexual inuendo. Actually it refers to it way more than an inuendo. Me So Horny is funny sh-t. The cover tells it all.
3,Great Sound!...If you can get around the interference.,"On display my local Target, these speakers sounded too good to be true for only fifty bucks. Beautiful high-quality sound, a not-to-deep bass from the low-powered subwoofer, and the 'SFX' button (simulates surround sound) just makes these things shine.What really takes the luster off these otherwise brilliant speakers is the lack of electronic interference shielding. Any closer than three feet from my wireless g router and they emit an annoying hiss/groan that is like nails on a chalkboard. Need to make a cell phone call? You better RUN from these mothers or you're getting a real earful with a sound akin to the shriek of a dying animal.Other than that, these things are great. Just be warned."
1,Poor Manufacturing,"This product was defective out of the box. The left speaker wasnt working.This is my second Altec Lansing speaker, I have to agree that they are good speakers with very good sound, as long as they work, my other system lost one speaker after 4 months.All in all there seem to be quality/manufacturing issues.My friend has the same issue, they stopped working 7 months into the purchase, and Altec Lansing would take replacements, but shipping has to borne out by yourself, this some times makes buying a new set more reasonable.I have burnt my hands twice and would advice caution, with Altec Lansing"
4,"Good speakers, well priced","I replaced an old set of Altec Lansing ACS295 speakers. I think the base was stronger on the ACS295, but adequate on VS2321. I was not looking for full volume music or sound effects. These deliver good reproduction on the nature sounds, jazz, gospel, and classical music CD's I listen to as well as computer or internet generated audio. These Altec Lansing speakers were very reasonably priced. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to like minded buyers."
4,"Crisp sound, good acoustic range","I listen to a lot of classical music on my computer while working. These speakers kick out a crisp, bright sound and pick up a lot of the lows that my other speakers did not. If you're looking for quality speakers but can't afford to pluck down a Benjamin Franklin, this is a great option."
2,"Started Good, Ended Bad","Like others, after a few months I noticed a bothersome hum from the right speaker. Now the subwoofer isn't working. It's under warranty but shipping it to Altec will probably cost over half what I paid for it. Don't take a chance with this unit!"
1,What doesn't interfer with these speakers,"I receive a horrible feed back hum when I place these speakers near my CPU, Monitor, router, or cordless phone. Which would not be a problem if I didn't wish to listen to audio out put of my PC in same room as my PC. As it is I my place the safety zone spacing game to be able to hear anything above the hum. They are computer speakers shield the things! Also they preform badly at lower volumes."
3,good film,this film was good. if you like to watch films about young people making it to the top then this one is excellent. also try the secret of my success starring michael j fox.
4,So this is why it won the Tony...,"I originally borrowed this CD from a friend and played it in the car on the way to work... then again and again... Reading the liner notes, I got the plot of the play down and could put the songs in context. But most of them stand on their own, as passionate pop-play songs, with interesting melodies, empassioned vocals, and that all-important factor: sing-along-bility.I've since purchased my own copy and love it. The play is coming to my town next month and I cannot wait to it and experience the songs in their true context."
5,Amazing show and CD,"I saw this show in New York just last week, and completely fell in love with it, so much so that I bought the CD right then and there. What an amazing show, so sad, so funny, so brilliant, with an extremely talented young cast that are full of energy. Whenever I listen to it, I long to go back to see it again. It is one of the most exciting musicals I've ever seen, and I hope to have the chance to see it again sometime."
1,Monotonous Garbage,"No one under the age of 25 is going to agree with me, but who cares. I think it's great they finally have a show about teens on Broadway, but to be this cliche', with so little if anything to say, uninteresting with a score poorly written is just a real pity. I suppose it's a start, but as far as speaking and expounding on youth, take me to HAIR any day over this."
4,"Just another... ""Awakening""","Spring Awakening is a great show. Its catchy/rock tunes can keep me going for hours. BUT, if your thinking about sitting along with elders listening to your new musical you've just bought and this happens to be playing.... think again! This musical which sounds to be wrapped around the lives of teens should stay just with teens themselves. When i heard the music i wasn't only appauled at the constant dops of ""f-bombs"" and other swears but the horrible or should i really say non-existant rhymes used. But, nonetheless it was good for originality in score which did cause me to set my mind aside and see what a truly great musical and what a honest and true musical it is."
2,The unsexiest book about sex I've ever read,"The phone sex premise is intriguing, but I was sorely disappointed. Despite the kinky sex fantasies, I was amazed Nicholson Baker could turn them into something so unsexy. I found it downright tedious, over-intellectualized, and pretentious. As I read, I kept thinking, ""Who talks like this?"" I gave it two stars instead of one because, to be fair, Vox is well-written. Too bad the pretty prose is wasted on a snooze-worthy non-story."
1,A pox on Vox,"Based on other reviews, I was expecting to find this book psychologically penetrating and intense. Instead, the dialogue was overintellectualized and contrived. Sadly, this book centering on phone sex wasn't even mildly erotic -- I'd have to be lobotomized to achieve fantasies as boring as this couples'. This is the kind of dreck that overcomes nature (at least in men) -- it makes you fall asleep BEFORE orgasm!"
2,One Big Phony,"Give me a break. This was written by a guy? The man on the phone has no idea what chenille is, but three pages later, he's talking about chenille and pointelle like he was in the rag business.And the dialog is just too mannerly and contains too much information dumping. Might be a great book for high schoolers, but once you been around the Cancer, Capricorn, and the City of Night, this is just toooooo precious."
3,a view of historey,this is a good book that can give you a quik review about the historey of textile.its a very freindly book that can give even to the amateur reader any idea about textile.
3,Wordy in all the Wrong Places,"My friend did a book project on this and the idea of the story fascinated me. Overall it was a good not great book. It was wordy in all the wrong places and any problem Ginny faced didnt seem real or likely. The author had a tendency to gloss over the details.Sometimes the entire thing seemed unrealistic. So many things could have gone wrong with an unsupervised minor trekking acorss Europe but none of those issues were addressed. At the end of the book I felt muddled and tired just like Ginny. Considering the kinds of book I have read in this genre it was an excellent book and i recomend it but I think there are better, more detailed books out there."
5,Cute Story!!,"A young adult book about a teenage girl who receives 13 little blue envelopes from her eccentric aunt who literally sends her on a like a scavenger hunt, wild goose chase to see Europe and live the life her aunt lived before she passed away. It was cute and I wish I would have had an aunt like that!"
2,13 little blue envelopes,I have read several books where someone received envelopes and had to open them at a certain time. I did not like any of them.But this one started out good but only for a couple of chapters. Then every time I picked it up to read it I would fall asleep.
4,Great Book... want to see letter 13,"I love this book! It's a great book and kept me hooked the whole time. Great balance of comedy, romance, and travel to keep you going. I wanted to see letter 13 though, so i wasn't too satisfied with the ending. I reccomend this for ages 13-15, but definitly a good read"
4,Fruity goodness,"I like the fruit in this rice with just about everything. It adds a little mystery to chili or a stir fry. I like to have lots of this on hand, because it's easy to alter indifferent ways."
5,I love this stuff,Hard to find in the grocery. I buy it by the case online. One box makes four lunches with some blackened chicken for protein. There is something about the sweet pineapple and curry that makes this rice mix delicious.
4,Needs to be listened to as well as read,"As with all of Sondheim's shows, with the possible exceptions of Follies and Sweeney Todd, the book is very hard to read without some sort of knowledge of the score, because that's what dominates the show. Other than a few scattered spoken passages, PASSION is completely sung-through. My recommendation would be to listen to the original cast recording as you read, so you can better understand the action."
5,heart warmer,"this cordless electric kettle is my favorite new kitchen tool, as I drink hot tea all day during the cooler weather. It is eco friendly, as it heats the water quicker than my gas range and the pot is cool on the outside, so no burned wrists when reaching nearby utensils. It is also ergonomically well designed making it easy to lift and pour."
4,Why design with plastic???,"First, let me say I love this kettle. The solid, stainless steel pot that won't leak (because it's solid), double-walled so it's cool to the touch on the outside, and even though the base is made of cheap plastic (mine came with a small crack in it that didn't affect functionality), it heats the water super-quickly and for the price is fine with me. I've had it for about 2 months now, still works great.But why do they make these kettles with tops that are half-plastic? I have yet to find a kettle that has NO plastic on any of the parts that touch the water. C'mon guys, boiling water touching plastic means eventually it will melt/break down."
1,Got cut on the metal lip!,Heats fine - but I cut my finger on the very sharp metal on the pouring spout. Not worth it. I've too many other family members who also use it. I was replacing another kettle that I'd had for 4 years which is no longer made. Guess I'll have to keep looking. What I really want is one of the variable temp ones that is also suitable for green teas as well as the higher temps for black teas.
5,"An amazing, well-researched book","In the media furor that has swirled around this book, one thing has become increasingly clear: few people have read the darn thing. Most people seem to be quoting the distorted newspaper articles that have appeared in the last few weeks. This book, based on Churchill's essay ""Some People Push Back: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens,"" is not an attempt to ""excuse"" the 9-11 attacks. Rather, it tries to figure out why they happened, and why Americans seem unable to understand why there's so much global anger directed our way. Using two detailed chronologies, Churchill recounts a long and sordid history of U.S. military assaults on other nations, millions of foreign civilians slaughted by our tax dollars, as well as countless violations of international law perpetrated by our government. Given this well-documented litany of abuse, Churchill's argument that some sort of response was--and is--inevitable makes perfect sense. Read the book!"
5,"Fun, Light-hearted, pick me up reading","This is a book that can be a coffee table book, or a back of the toilet bowl book. The reading is funny, the pictures are funnier. You are going to read this and not only be able to agree with it but I can almost guarantee that you will be thinking of other alternative uses!!! (Two Thumbs Up)"
1,Spoiled brat and overbearing mother,"I see this a book about a spoiled brat who to his determent uses his gifts to get his way with a weak willed mother. I also see a mother who delegates her prenatal responsibilities and blames her failures on those to whom she delegated her duties. The mother delegates the responsibility to some outsider. After 32 hours of instruction and a warning from the step father, she should realize that her son has a problem driving but gives him a car to drive without even driving with him once to see if he is up to the responsibility. What kind of lazy, socially irresponsible person is that. The real problem which this book does not seem to address is how to teach AS people how to understand and be more accommodating of the NT crowd. This book shows AS people in a undeserved light. The only good it serves is how not to handle the situation."
4,A beautiful collection of accoustic country/bluegrass tunes,"There seems to be some controversy about this country flavoured album by Bill Frisell. If you are focused on buying good ""jazz"" you may be disappointed. If you are focused on good music, this is a fine choice. My already high respect for Frisell rose when I heard him play this country/bluegrass music (under the title ""Nashville"" may I point out) showing nothing but respect for this genre of music that is so often dismissed. Amazingly, Frisell is able to make an album that sounds like straight country/bluegrass and still have it sound like a Bill Frisell album.I am a musician, but not a guitar player. I don't know how hard the guitar playing is here, but it sure is beautiful. If you are into jazz and want to expand your tastes, this not a bad place to start."
1,Another childhood memory bites the dust.,"I had very fond childhood memories of Saber Rider, so I was excited to find this dvd. Unfortunately, watching it again as an adult, I find that it's really bad. Really, really bad. It doesn't help that I've been watching Starblazers, another childhood favorite, since there's no comparison in terms of animation, plotting, and overall quality.I'm pretty sure this is a cartoon ONLY a child can love."
3,Good album,"If you're open-minded enough to like such diverse Bowie offerings as Never Let Me Down, Young Americans, and Tonight, you'll like Black Tie White Noise.Hear Bowie combining elevator jazz, dance beats, and pop songs structures. Listen to Bowie's dissonant saxophone (supposedly playing middle eastern tonalities) clash with funky bass lines. Listen to forboding, fractured lyrics imbue tired arrangments with new meaning.A good pastiche.Some of the extra tracks (especially Lucy Can't Dance) are fun, and the bonus DVD is worth watching. It's especially entertaining to watch Bowie defend his ""heterosexuality."""
3,A long-winded editorial,"What's included is good, and Judy has a lot of ideas about judicial reform in America. Some of the cases she reflects back on are horrifying. However, there's too much of the same thing. Judy writes much like she talks on TV...it's entertaining and so forth, but on paper it gets tiring after awhile. I got about halfway through the book and then said to myself, ""Okay, I get the picture,"" and then decided not to read further. This might be a good book to put online sometime."
4,"Very Good Reading, but mainly a summary of her cases.","The book made for good reading, but be forewarned, it contains mostly summaries of court cases with little segues."
5,She's the boss Applesauce,Judge Judy is truely inspiring lady. Her book goes over what is happening in our society and why it is happening. She gives her gut views on the issue and no nonsense kinda women. Judy gives examples on cases that she has tried and explains the the problems that faces our society on a daily basis. I Love the book myself and will cherish it forever. I recomend it to antyone intersted in the field of our justice system. Judy you are A Hero. Let us stand and salute her for being a great judge. Thank you Judy for your great insight to life.
2,There are better books out there,I was deeply deeply disappointed with this book. I had come to expect more from the Shabby Chic then I was given this time around.
1,Time to bury this one,"Isn't it time that this fusty old book and trend were given a decent burial? The rooms are dated and busy, busy, busy."
1,Worst Service Ever,They have not even shipped my book yet and it is past the day that it was said to arrive. Never use this company. They are unpredictable and you will not receive your books on time.
4,The Best Biography on Benjamin Banneker,This biopic of Bejamin Banneker (Ben Bey) is very revealing and gives the reader a look inside of Banneker's personal life (even though some of it might be merely educated guess work regarding his intimate relationships). Some conjecture and innuendo is tossed around a bit irresponsibly but overall one of the best if not the best work on Ben Bey. This has to be one of the first books about Ben Bey that mentions his hereditary extraction (Malian & Fulani). I didn't know upon Banneker's expiration his house and most of all his works were burned to ashes by his racist enemies. Depriving the world of a first hand look into his accomplishments. Cerami also explains the close friendship of Ben Bey and Benjamin Franklin in detail. I believe Charles Cerami portrays Ben Bey and his scientific genius better than all the biographies before it.
4,Not the hard stuff but works well.,"Not as good as a Clorox, etc. but seems to work well. Switched to a less toxic cleaner because we moved to house with a septic tank but also as a lesstoxic alternative. Seems to need more frequent cleanings but worth the switchfor my family and the tank."
1,Gary Moore Is not the greatest on this dvd -1,"I know Gary Moore Is not the greatest on this dvd. I bought it was not very happy.Then I seen another dvd by Gary Moore called Ballads & Blues 1982 -1994.Also on the dvd was live Blues with BB King.Since I love blues Gary Moore & BB King.It was a Import only a few sellers were selling it.I bought one when It came I put it in my dvd player.This dvd of Gary Moore with BB King blew me away.I went back on amazon to see if there were any more left.They were all gone for about 2 or 3 months.Was told the dvd Is rare & hard to find.After keeping my eyes open for a while.It was for sale on amazon again bought 2 more.I did not know if the dvd would be available again.Its a piece of history to own for Gary Moore & BB King fans"""
2,sad,did not get- out of stock- gave two stars because seller did tell me what was going on with the order
4,WOW. It's Amazing.,"Hello, This Olympus C-211 is one of the best cameras I have ever bought. It's really a good and beautiful Camera. Why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5! Well, coz its big size but it's ok when u have 2 cameras in one. I just say Wow."
5,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!,"I entered digital photography very reluctantly, and only when I found the C-211 that would also make prints. The combination of the instant gratification of Polaroid and the fine digital quality of Olympus have made me one happy camper!"
3,almost two much,"One thing for sure this camera does everything they say it willand more. The only problem I have with it. Is that is bulky and a little awkward and sometimes the polaroid feature will not ejecta photo. For a buisness camera its nice for a family camera it needs a little work one other draw back if you use the polaroid feature alot make sure you have lots of batteries because it is very hard on them. Rechargable one's are the only way to go. It also will take upto 20seconds of video, the digital pic's are very clear and print out on a good photo printer as good as any film camera. J gillespie"
1,Disappointing,"Sadly this product did not work for me at all. After eye issues I have had to switch to daily disposables. I have had a great deal of difficulty in removing them. I was hoping this would help. However, I have never been successful in removing them with this tool. Maybe others will have more luck. For the price I thought it was worth a try. It works well for inserting contacts if you have issues with that but that is not my problem, only removing them."
2,Music does not stand alone,"The movie is great and the music fits the movie very well. But without the movie to watch, the music isn't very interesting. The soundtrack has many boring stretches, but if you were watching the movie, the music would make sense.Contrast this soundtrack with that of The Hours, Notes On A Scandal, The Illusionist, Pan's Labyrinth or The Fountain to name just a few. These are great soundtracks either with or without the movie. In other words, the music is independent of the movies.So, you may find my 2-star rewview to be harsh, but as a stand-alone soundtrack, Kundun is well below average."
3,WD 80Gb Hard Drive,"I though it's sealed new item as they are description but it was open seal package, I had little disappoint for this item.Anyway it's works."
5,Great slide,"A great heavy slide. Fits over even my fat fingers. Looks good even when I'm playing at parties, my glass slides always look a mess as I eat finger foods as I play, but mud slide doesn't show finger marks too badly."
3,An album for everyone,"This is an extremely solid album and an album that anyone could love--and maybe that's why I'm left with the feeling that it falls short of what it might have been. These guys are some of the best--and each of them has released plenty of cutting edge stuff, but this album has them all solidly within their comfort zone. They've created a superlative performance, but not a particularly moving one.This is an album that almost anyone can feel good about--and if you're anything like me, for music to really shake your world, it needs to be more personal than that. This will never be my favorite album, and it probably won't become yours either, but listen to it anyways, and learn the tunes if you're so inclined.The album comes off as a tasteful jam session. Nothing wrong with that, but these guys have all created much more exciting stuff."
3,Solid if not spectacular,"3 1/2It is easy to be underwhelmed simply from expectations for such a lineup, but in between all the appeasement factors still lies a vibrant nucleus with advanced chemistry that is undeniable."
5,Interested in weird things going on?,Here's a movie to wet your whistle and get you to thinking about things in a different light. You'll next visit the rest of the Watchers series. Truly enjoyed the time spent with family members watching the Watchers.
2,Not as food as all the reviews say,"We saw lots of rave reviews of this series, so we purchased it to see what it was. It was interesting, but not actually worth buying to watch."
5,CAN'T PUT THE IDEAS INTO PRACTICE FAST ENOUGH!,"I am loving your book! I can't read it fast enough or put the ideas into practice fast enough! Thank You! Barbara Lovejoy , author, Value You, Become An Unforgettable Woman."
3,Far from the best of Miller,"It is a good work, but it doesn't keep the level of the others Sin City tales. This time, the main character - Wallace - is an ex-soldier, extremely well trained (almost a Ninja) trying to save a girl from a secret organization. But Wallace is a good Samaritan, the kind of person we'd never expect to find in Sin City. Personally I prefer the anti-heroes normally found in Frank Miller's stories.Action and violence are present as well as in other Sin City tales, what makes this story worthy to be read, but don't expect to find the best of Miller."
2,"Poor illustration and story, with one memorable sequence","This is the least of Miller's ""Sin City"" comics. The story is weak in that the relationships, the plot lines and detours, and the sex and violence are all very clumbsy and unfinished: reads like a painfully long pulp novel or a piece of art made to fulfill a contract. The illustrations are equally uninspired, very careless character designs and shoddy linework in general compared to other razor-sharp ""Sin City"" strips. The hallucination sequence near the end is for me the only memorable part of this whole thing."
4,GREAT SOUND,"THE SURROUNDBAR PRODUCES GREAT SOUND. LIKE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS I READ IT DOES NOT PRODUCE A 360 DEGREE AFFECT. BUT IT DOES GET THE SOUNDS TO THE SIDES OF THE ROOM. THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS GREAT, EVEN WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC. I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN AS THE SOUND AFFECT IS GOOD ENOUGH CONSIDERING, I DON'T HAVE TO RUN WIRES, WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE ROOM IT IS IN."
4,POLK AUDIO SOUNDBAR,"Easy to install, each cable have a color that match with the plug in the receiver.Sound good not great, but the relation price/sound is excellent. The solution is that your receiver be a 7.1 so you can install two more speakers in the back and the sound will be real soundround."
4,Moment of Romance II,"This movie is very nice to see. It is very great in action and romantic too. But it's a bit sad at the ending part when the main actor, Aaron died and Cecilia Ng didn't know about it and had to go back to her hometown. If Aaron did not die maybe he and Cecilia will be together and will be very happy instead."
3,Overpriced,"I have this on VHS and was somewhat surprised to find it on DVD for the price. The running time is just over a half hour and there are no extras listed. Most of the film was shot in South Royalton, Vermont back in the early '80's and some of the stores kept their Hadleyburg logos into the new century. I used to have a summer home six miles away, but if you didn't, the nostalgia is not worth twenty bucks. I'll keep my VHS tape (if I can find it.)"
5,Excellent CD,"This is another excellent work from Hybrid. Y4K shows a different side of Hybrid than what I've heard in Morning Sci-Fi, and Wide Angle, but they are none the less incredible. They have a true nack for intelligent, deep, electronic music. I would consider that there are about 3-4 ""filler"" tracks in this CD which are OK, but the rest is jaw-dropping and the whole work is pretty much seamless."
3,The Wall and the Wing,"I don't normally read this type of fantasy, but this is one my youngest brother got so I read it. The Wall And The Wing is about a future society (New York where people can fly). Well everyone can fly except Gurl, an orphan who rummages for food in the garbage most nights. Her life changes when she learns she can turn herself invisible, and she uses this power to do all sorts of nastiness."
4,great experience,"I was satisfied with my double feature movie pack,it came in just enough time and was sealed in original package."
2,No sparkle at all,"The earings themselves look nice but if you are buying them because of the diamonds then don't waste your time. You will be sending them back like I did.The diamonds have absolutely no sparkle, even in the direct sun. The only reason why I buy things with diamonds is because they sparkle, these don't, they look like someone forget to put in the batteries."
1,"No ""Cheer"" with this glass",One of the glasses in the set has just broken up into pieces upon slightly touching another glass after an year of careful use. Disappointed.
4,"Love them, but they're fragile","I bought 8 of these glasses. 4 broke. Be very GENTLE with these. Don't carelessly drop ice in the glass, or violently stir a spoon in the glass. I've been very careful with the last 4 glasses I still have, and they've lasted me for 4 years now. As long as you're aware of how fragile they are, you can enjoy them for years of use. They really do a fantastic job with keeping cold liquids cold (ice doesn't melt for hours), and hot liquids hot. Absolutely no condensation forms on the glass, so no coaster is ever needed! I highly recommend these glasses, but just be careful."
1,Bodum Exploders,Watch it with these things. We've gone through 10 of them. One time I set one down on a granite countertop a little hard and it exploded all over the room. That's happened several times. And we have little kids. I'm surprised that these things are still sold. Someone is going to get hurt.
3,"a good enough book, a good enough daughter","This volume details a daughter's death watch on her 90-year-old, retired farmer father. A certain emotional distance is maintained by the use of ""old man,"" ""the mother,"" ""the brother"" ... rather than proper names. This technique adds a poignancy to the use of ""Josef, Josef"" for the old man (father).Memories and dreams are used effectively to provide the relevant history of the primary characters. The choice of physical details and gestures are the author's strength. At times, however, the choice of language in translation and inconsistencies in the text send this reader's mind on distracting side trips.This is a quite satisfactory novel. However, there are so many better novels that I would recommend this only for those to whom the content - a death watch - has special meaning."
5,Excelente!!!,This CD is great. I have been looking for a CD to help bring me back to my Cuban roots and this is the one. You understand the origins of a lot of the music we listen to today after listening to this. You can put this CD and let it play without skipping any of the tracks because they are all EXCELENTE!!!
1,Fabric is NOT colorfast,"The fit is fantastic, but there is a huge problem. The slip cover fabric is not colorfast - the color will rub off or bleed on to your sofa upholstry. If you have a dark or similar color sofa, this won't be an issue... but my cream colored sofa is now PINK."
3,A musical,"I didn't read the description, so I wasn't expecting all the singing. I like musicals, but this was not my favorite Curious George that I've watched. However, my kids seemed to like it enough. I like the shows better."
5,Great family movie,"Great movie for the family for the Christmas. Love the ""Christmas Monkey"" song (very catchy). If your kids like George, then all will enjoy this movie!"
3,Has something scary in it.,"My daughter is 3 and loves Curious George, but for some reason she is scared of something on this dvd. She watched it once and started crying, said she was scared. I'm still trying to figure out what it is, but she doesn't like it and won't watch it."
3,A fun summer beach read,"This is a great book to read on a hot humid hazy day. Light, humorous and mindless. Cute."
4,ANOTHER FLORIDA WRITER,"I read a lot of books in the mystery genre that deals with Florida, and I keep being told to try James W. Hall, the Thorn series. But I found a used book, HARD AGROUND, outside the Thorn series and decided to try it before trying his series stuff. This book is very good. Nice story line, fun characters and good witty dialogue. Perhaps a little predictable but worth my time in a hammock or at the beach. The story deals with the death of Daniel Tyler and with it his secret location for lost treasure an how brother Hap and Dan's girl friend Marguerite work together (really together) to unlock the mystery and stay alive. RECOMMENDED. Will try Thorn for sure."
4,"Not Literature, But Pretty Good","Better than most 2nd rate authors (e.g., Womack, White, etc.). Not Leonard, Hiaasen, Ellroy, etc., but not bad at all compared to the rest of the 2nd tier. Recommend it if your favorite first authors don't have anything in paperback, and I don't really say that for the others (but I read in the bathroom, so I've had extensive experience).Better than the 2nd tier, but not 1st tier (but let's watch him)."
4,Ha!,"And some thought the MTV show Jack@$$ was beyond human explanation. Enter The Darwin Awards, compiler extraordinaire.My Driver's Ed teacher emphasized this for defensive driving: Identify, Predict, Decide, and Execute. Good 'ol IPDE would've been a helpful notice to those who were worthy of a Darwin Award. These honored individuals made me say ""what if"", ""he could've"", and ""i can't believe it"" several times. You'll laugh, sympathize, and feel smart all in one sitting.If you ever need to know why you still exist, the Darwin Awards answers that plain and simple: survival of the fittest (and smartest)."
2,"Distracting, but no more.","Virtually everyone has already seen these accounts on the internet and in email. Having them all together is really not worthwhile. It turns out (as might be expected) that the really entertaining Darwin Awards are fictional, and while they're included, relegating them to ""Urban Legends"" takes a little wind out of the whole concept of the Award. With few exceptions, the book is filled out with less amusing accidents and mistakes. The author tries to add value with various debunking, a few bits of scientific trivia, and some tangential comments at the start of each chapter. On the whole, it's a distracting collection - quickly read, but quite forgettable."
4,Learn and Die.,"In this of, literary stupidity, (Not the author, the stories in the book itself), I find myself laughing at things I normally woudln't find the least bit humourous. Although I do find this work, morbid and disturbing, It shows you just how stupid some people are.I also have something to say about the people who don't like the book based purely on fact it saye EVOLUTION on the front. To You I think you people are sick, and closed-minded, and I'm sorry that you have to live your life in shorwd of denile, over a theory, nobody has proven god exisits, but you believe in him. Nowhere in the book does it say ""god does not exist"". So if choose to continue to live in your sheltered little world, where big bad THERORY'S cease to exists, I hope you happy, because everyone who you you shun because of differing opinions will not be. You discriminating selfish person. I truely pity you."
3,entertaining afternoon reading material,"I checked this book out at my local library and found it to be somewhat entertaining,yet a little disappointing somehow. For your money you'll be getting a collection of stories of incredibly stupid acts people have committed, some of them are identified as true, some as urban legends, and some as unknown. The Darwin part comes in by the fact that these people either by killing themselves or by injury became incapable of reproducing thereby not passing their stupidity on to future generations. The book is a quick read, and interesting, but will be a low priority on my accquisition list."
3,"Amusing, but...","An amusing book, with fun stories and interesting commentary. The witty style of the writing is appealing. However, I found some inaccuracies disturbing, and there was little attempt to separate fact from fiction in some parts of the book. If you are an afficianado of the Darwin Awards (and, honestly, who isn't?) you'll enjoy this book. If you are a hard-core researcher of the veracity of urban legends, however, some parts of this book might irritate you."
1,warped sense of humour,"I will lead by saying that a one star rating is my own personal opinion and that there are clearly people out there that would very much enjoy a book like this. I am writing a review simply for those that might like to hear another view point on the contents. First - this is a book made up entirely of very short stories (jokes?), mostly only one page long, about real events in which someone, or several people, died, as a result in thier errors of judgement. Second - you must have a sense of humour capable of overlooking the fact that these people really did die, and at a great loss to the people that loved them. Third - a great number of these stories are about ordinary people, not criminals/terrorists etc. Fourth - you must also be capable of overlooking how you might feel if someone you know and loved died like this and a book came out that made a joke of it. That is about all I have to say on the matter."
1,Repugnant,These stories succeed only in making officious fun of sad human error. It's a book to make the self important even more arrogant. This book is depressing and its readership equally discouraging.
2,Glitches still exist!,"We ordered this game as a Christmas gift for my son. . Needless to say, it was very disappointing to find that defective copies of the game are still on the market in Nov. and Dec. when the problem was discovered before May! The recall has been going on for so long ther was no direct link on the company's home page. You must web search to find the proper site and get recall instructions. We were instructed to ship just the game (defective game cartridge only) to the company. It took at least 4 weeks to receive a working game cartridge (which ironically arrived in just a waterproof envelope!) I would have given the game a higher star rating as my son says it is enjoyable, but a flaw that affected so many games should have been corrected (and the defective cartridges recalled from the distributors) long before the holidays."
5,Awesome,"Great music! Shipping was fast with prime. Bought this as a gift and my uncle loved it. Listen and preview the music, order and you won't be disappointed."
4,Excellently written,Mr. Burroughs has done an excellent job in communicating his experiences of alcoholism and the struggle of rehab and the 12 step programs. He has been able to share the reality of his experiences and at the same time show a great deal of humor and sophisticated irony. A very good book and one that I will read again.
2,A good book...,"If you like graphic descriptions of every type of sex between gay men. The book was decent up until the first mention of homosexuality which caught me a bit by surprise as I saw no reference to this on the Amazon.com page or reviews- only 5 stars. I have no problem with homosexuality, however I don't enjoy reading about EVERY detail of the authors sexual encounters with other men. I continued reading until part two when the sexual descriptions became almost the entire story rather than with him dealing with his drinking problem. I then decided to skim through the book and see if it got any better, however the passages I read only became more graphic and came more often. If you think this book is about an advertising exec who discovers he is an alcoholic- you're in for a big surprise."
5,First Rate,"I am female, not gay, not a recovering alcoholic or recovering anything, and this is one of the best books I have ever read. Augusten Burroughs tells his story with such uncensored honesty, revealing every aspect of himself, warts and all, that I found it absolutely compelling. I thought there couldn't be a better writer than Pat Conroy, but this guy is right up there with him. Can't wait for the next book!"
3,could have been better,"Firstly, despite all the blurb on the cover, this book really isn't ""outrageously funny"" or ""hilarious"" etc etc. In my opinion it's just moderately humorous - no more, no less. Still, it is a fairly gripping read, especially for any 12-steppers. What perhaps is not quite believable is that - despite being a raging drunk - he get's instantly sober with one visit to a clinic and remains like that for what seems to be months. That's a bit unusual and makes me think that perhaps he wasn't really at rock-bottom in the first place. And, as another reviewer remarked, a lot of the bits about AA Meetings and recovery etc really do write themselves. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining read."
5,TRULY AMAZING!,"I thought Running with Scissors was as good as it gets, boy was I wrong! Dry is an incredible memoir from start to finish. Don't look for a boring moment in this book, because you just won't find it. Augusten's tales of rehab, and the subsequent lifestyle that follows are highly entertaining. He details success, friendship, love, and loss in a funny and poignant manner. His formerly wild lifestyle is on display for all the world to see. If you read Running with Scissors, this is a necessity. Dry is the kind of book that leaves the reader craving more."
5,"Dry, it is not","Author, Augusten Burroughs likes to drink. He likes to drink more - I hope - than you can imagine. This book is funny and sad. It is a sad story told in a manner that often leads the reader to laughter. Upon reflection it is frightening.This book is a good read for those who drink maybe too much or know somebody who does. It provides an inside view of the struggles of a heavy drinker who attempts to quit. Dry, A memoir, likely won't change the world, but it might change your part of it if you read it.Laugh, cry, feel the pain and pour that bottle down the drain.Five stars - (light ""R"")"
5,Awesome,"Ok, Augusten, when is your next memoir coming out? I want to know who this Dennis is? How you met him? Why French Bulldogs and how long it took you to get back into life after pigman died? I love your writing!! Keep the books coming and keep the articles in OUT coming too. You are hilarious as well as extremely talented!!!"
4,Dry humor,"After the completely crazy world that Borroughs took us to in ""Running With Scissors"" I thought this book would be somewhat of a let-down. I was pleasantly surprised. This book was not quite as off-the-wall funny and disturbing as Scissors, but it was more moving and no less interesting. Bouroughs takes us inside the world of addiction, AIDS, advertising, gay lifestyle and many more, and they are all equally captivating. Like his early life, Agusten takes things to extremes when it comes to his adult life. The story goes from funny to grave in a heartbeat. It's a great read for addicts and non-addicts alike. Also the fact that his books never seem overtly ""gay"" is good. Boroughs shows us the gay lifestyle (at least his) and focusses on the relationships, but we never feel like we're reading a ""gay"" story. It's simply a great and moving story by a fine writer. I read it in only a couple days. Definitely check this one out."
2,"A fun little movie, if ...","BEN & ARTHUR ... What an awesome movie ... all you need is a bunch of friends, enough alcohol (or whatever substance you need to make it fun!), and a great sense of humor. Think of this movie like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" ... add your own subtitles, and it's a GREAT FILM!!!(if you don't have the friends, the alcohol, or the sense of humor, this film SUCKS!!)"
4,Powerful songs of a tragic war,"I think this is a reissue of the old Folkways ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War"" with some added material. These are very powerful and moving songs, sung by artists who were themselves engaged in the struggle...quite wonderful. The sound has not been electronically cleaned up, but that's fine--it has the grit of the original performances. The only disappointment is that this quite expensive CD comes without the texts of the songs, which are mainly in Spanish and German--you'll have to search the net to find them."
5,XL!-ent album!,"Back in '91 they had two tracks off the album on the radio...then I spaced out on them until 13 years later in 2004, I bought it, love it! Excellent soulful tunes, some lively tracks and also deep, sultry, slow jams for the bedroom. I love these girls, wish they had had greater commercial success. Now I'm buying another CD, can't remember where I left the 1st one."
5,Flight of the Falcon-An Excellent Choice,This is a great book on the Falcons of the World. Great information.Very factual. An interesting review for those who have always beeninterested in Falcon species.
3,For math lovers,"I got this book because I wanted to strengthen my skills with basic probability as it relates to gaming, gambling and trading.In some areas the problems here were helpful to me, and the solutions are well explained.In a few areas the problems were way over my head and in areas I either don't understand or am not interested in.That said, I think anyone with an interest in the subject won't be disappointed with this thin book, except maybe wishing there was a greater variety of problem types, which was one complaint I had, the second was that the solutions were a bit too complicated, which may mean I'm just not smart enough, however, it would have been a bit stronger of a book if it had explained some of the items at a lower level (for us numbskulls)."
5,Great Price Great Meal,"Was a good price and was a hard to find item we are thrilled to have found it taste great. I recommend this to others, and It received a five star because the packaging and quality was excellent."
3,Hair metal still rocks,"I had this cassette tape when I was in high school, when hair bands ruled (wait, don't they still?). I love the remake of Smoke on the Water, and ""My Dad is Bigger Than Your Dad"" is one of my other favs. I had a hard time finding this tape then, and a hard time finding the cd now, but it's worth it. Give it a listen!"
3,Country Maps: Southern Italy (Hammond International,"I am a bit disappointed at the lack of detailed smaller roads on this Hammond map. The Kummerly + Frey Italia del Sud map ( Map of Southern Italy) is much better in showing smaller roads, but I was not able to find it for southern Italy at this time on Amazon. So I tried this map. Will continue to look for the K+F map."
1,A smorgasboard of eroticsim for who .......,I gave this book a one star rating since half the stories were from the USA not making this an INTERNATIONAL book to be sold in the USA by any means. Missing from the anthology were any stories from India (considering its one of the only countries with temples dedicated to the erotica) and only one story from Japan (a dumb story I might add that included scenes of girls rubbing bacon on their bodies)Most of the stories are from what I would consider unpublished writers with the exception of Anne Rice's 'Beuty's Release' ... The stories are also a real eclectic mix and altough some of the are good its hard to have to search for 100 good pages in an almost 600 page book.
3,"Enjoyable if you like ""critically acclaimed""","I enjoyed this movie because I generally like ""artsy"" movies that are critically acclaimed, which we all know generally translates to ""most people think it sucks"". I watched this movie because I'm a huge tennis fan. It's not a tennis movie per se, but the story of finding yourself in life revolves around tennis in this movie. It was entertaining and worth the rent, although I wouldn't necessarily buy it."
3,Smile for the Camera,"My son loves cameras so I thought this would be a wonderful gift for him. He plays with it quite a bit, but the shutter button has a tendency to stick after he plays with it for a while. The different faces shown on the revolving block are very entertaining. My son has also learned to say ""cheese"" from one of the phrases said on the camera."
5,A Real Saint!,"If you want to know what it means to ""Love"" as the Gospel of Christ tells us, read this book. Faith, Hope and Love are lived in Saint Kolbe's life like no other. I have a new role model in Saint Kolbe."
5,Great purchase!,"I first purchased this CD over 15 years ago after we saw Elizabeth perform in an elementary school in Dryden, NY. My children now want to create fun memories they enjoyed by singing and dancing to these silly songs with their own children. I also use this with my Kindergarten students!"
3,Not for joggers,"In most respects this CD player is just what I wanted. Unfortunately it does not offer the level of shock resistance that I hoped for. It skips frequently when used while jogging. Otherwise, a fine product."
2,Um...,"I've had this CD Player for about a year now. When I first got it, it was dream. But I found after about 3 months after I bought it, it skipped every cd I put in it. No matter if it was plugged into the wall, 40 second anti-skip was on, or whatever, it just seemed to stop working right after the warranty was up. I'm listening to it right now and it won't even play the first couple of songs on my cd. So, I threw it on the ground with force. I've been listening to it for about 5 minutes now and it hasn't skipped yet. So, there might be some hope left. Buy a Sony or Panisonic."
4,Lovin' it so far!,"I just received my gpx discman and so far it has been working great. However, I agree with all the others who say that the headphones bring down the quality of the player. Since I just received my product yesterday, I'm probably going to go out and buy some other headphones.Aside from the quality of the headphones, they look a little silly too. The CD player looks awesome, I just think the headphones look a little crappy. All these complaints don't sound like I would give it a four, but the main unit, the cd player, works great. The ESP works well. I would recommend this unit if your willing to spend a few extra bux on some new headphones."
3,Good while it lasted,"I enjoyed using my GPX while it lasted. It looks awesome, and it's so light and compact that I could just put it in my jacket pocket and listen to music where ever I went; then jump in the car and plug it in there, and I'm wired. The anti-skip function is the best I've seen. I haven't tried throwing it on the ground, like so many say they have, but it's worked well even upside-down bouncing around in my pocket. However, believe what everyone else says about the headphones. Very flimsy and the sound is subpar, but if you like the color and the price, you may overlook their shortcomings. Whether it's the car hook-up or what, it stopped working and I did't try it on headphones again before it turned into a CD player raisin in the back of my car. Oops. Well, it was nice while it lasted."
3,\Synth Style\,"""The Great Commandment"" got me into this band. Being a fan of electronic music, I accepted long ago that even though the Depeche Mode influences can be heard in a lot of synth groups, each one has its own savoir-faire so to speak. Not every tune is a hit here, but there are enough good ones to check out. ""That Smiling Face"" and ""Winner Takes Nothing"" are a couple high points, there are others... It's interesting to listen to the nuances between British synth and say, German synth, a la Camouflage. Everybody's got a different interpretation and that is cool.De/Vision is another fantastic German group I recommend..."
3,Why not $1000?,"It *is* an instructive book - for someone with econometrics background, in my case - however, I suspect that practical lessons one can take out of it are largely specific to binary forecasts. And then, of course, there is the insane price - four-five times what it should be."
5,Fever for the bayou,The music is the best I've heard in some time I hope to fine an equal album in the near future
4,A decent collection,"""Methods of Silence"" is deeply indebted to Depeche Mode's younger synth sound, but the album is well worth a listen. Several of the songs are amazingly catchy--""Anyone"" and ""Love Is a Shield"" stand out. Some are just plain fun, like ""On Islands,"" and others hint at more original ground. A personal favorite of mine is ""Your Skinhead Is the Dream,"" a dreamy synth ballad. It's not DM, but it's close enough to be worth a listen."

4,The Chase,It was a great story. I very much enjoyed the cat and mouse Chase. Very funny also. I must say Lynsay Sands you have done it again. You are a wonderful author. Keep the books coming.
4,Couldn't put it down...,This book was filled with humor and characters that were relatable. I've already ordered the first two books in this series and cannot wait to read them.
