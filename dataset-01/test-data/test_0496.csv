1,Leaks,This is one of the worse buys I've done. The bottle doesn't fit right in the tray and the the tray falls off. Don't buy. Really bad for hikers.
4,It was a hit,I took the DVD to Panama and shared it with twin girls who joined in and had a lot of fun .
5,Fun for all!,"I purchased this DVD to introduce my 5 year old granddaughter to Yoga and it worked. We both enjoyed all aspects of the DVD: music, exercises, and general mood of the presentation were upbeat and encouraging. Highly recommended."
2,Totaly dissatisfied with this book,"I have a lot of game-collections/biography chess books in my library, considering the best ones Life & Games of Mikhail Tal and I Play Against Pieces by Svetozar Gligoric but, belive it or not, this Kramnik one is the worst I have encountered with. Every game is tipically anotated as quick fix for some second rate chess magazine, without any wish for explaining itself or its background to the reader. And authors own biography is just short of unexistent, although it is known that he had a rich life chesswise, before going on top (working in famous Botvinnik chess school, playing junior games against famous oponents of today etc.) Its a shame, and I hope that updated version would be much frendlier and filled with important games played in last five years, and with extended biography."
2,Pheremones,"As with any perfume, the scent of it on your skin is what determines how the end product smells. I didn't particularly like how it smelt in the bottle and when I sprayed it on myself, it got even worse. I would recommend getting a sample of this first because it is such a strong scent that you are either going to love it or hate it and once you have it on it takes forever for it to go away."
5,unreal,If you like strong powerful jazz I think it is worth your while to pick this recording up. Although this cd cannot compare to the actual live recording in Spain it has got to be the next best thing. If anyone has any information regarding the Return Of The Brecker Brothers vhs tape please e-mail Dan @this address dowdowdan@aol.com I am trying to find a copy of it for my collection
3,Remake of the original.................again,"Johnny Cash is the Marshal taking in his prisoner Kris Kristofferson (playing the John Wayne part), Waylon Jennings as the gambler rides along with Willie Nelson as Doc Holliday (there was a physician in the original but not a gun fighting dentisit) and a couple of female roles in this redo of the John Ford classic stagecoach journey through indian territory. Mr Ford has not to worry. Fine to watch this gagle of county western stars walk through a familiar story line. Nothing new."
5,Great DVD/CD Player,"This player is one that is of high quality, and I would recommend fully to anyone. GREAT PRODUCT!!"
1,Yo!,"Yo.Listened to Grateful dead built to Last on the way to work today...Holy wow bro.Haven't heard it in years...I used to like it in highschool...not cool.Dead heads think they are cool, but they could not be...they could, but they could also not be.DBM/Jam syndrome....Some of the songs sound like Richard Marx wrote them. and sung em.Brent Mydland dude...not glad anyone died, but that was a rough 12 year period for the dead.Jerry just didn't give a hoot...all he cared about was getting high on the horse."
3,Ironic Title for this Disc,"I bought this CD because of the poignant and plaintive ""Standing on the Moon."" IMHO it's the best song on the disc. The Dead were definitely in what seems like a ""winding down"" period by the time this disc was released, so ""Built to Last"" is not their most enduring work. Kind of ironic."
2,The worst stragedy guide I have EVER seen...,"This is the worst stragedy guide I have ever seen, when I pay like 10 bucks for the damn thing I want all the hints with out having to go online to find out everything, thats the WHOLE reason I got the stupid thing in the first place. Okay now that I got that out of the way...here is the problem, it gives you enough hints so not to ruin the story (this is what I do like about the thing...thus the 2 stars) but, to get any more info you have to [go online] to get the stuff. TO me that kinda kills the reason to get the thing in the first place. Like I said before, the one good thing (the one and only good thing) is that it doesnt ruin the story by giving you to many hints...they really could have done better. And I want to know whos stupid idea it was to have all the extra hints online anyway."
1,A banner ad in a book.,"I agree with many people here that this book does more to promote you going to playonline.com than actually being a strategy guide itself. Save your money, and just take the book's message of ""go to playonline.com."""
1,All these other reviews have been my recovery therapy...,"Needless to say I was rather depressed and more than a little angry with my purchase, so I went to see what everyone else thought of it here. Thankfully, you all hated it as much as I did, which has saved some part of a day I had rued. Thanks all for your entertaining and small attempts to describe how horrible this guide is.. even though I'm pretty certain the worthlessness of this book is beyond description...."
1,DO NOT EVEN BOTHER,This has to be the worst guide I have ever bought. Everything is on there web site.The reson I buy guides is so I don't have to go on the net. I likehave a book I can refer to quickly. With I have to go on the net with my 56k modem and wait forever to get the info I want. Anyways don't even bother buying this. It SUCKS!
2,So-So,This book is ok but not the best ever made.I think it is a better idea just to buy the game and play. This game is not very hard and it is very self explanitory.
1,You must be out of your mind!,"Ok, last I checked, Strategy guides should have strategy in them...Not a bunch of codes to use online to find out what you need to know. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this complete waste of trees."
2,A Huge Disappointment...,"...and a regretted purchase. Every time I have tried to reference something in this guide, it just points me to a website (which gives poor detail anyway) where after navigating for about 3-4 minutes, I can find a clue about what I want to know, nothing more. It lacks much info on sidequests, and very little about abilities. It, however, looks very well made, which seems an attempt to trick the reader into thinking it is a quality guide. What it boils down to is this: your money for a book that you could write yourself."
1,"If I wanted the help online, I wouldn't have bought the guide","Im sure pretty much everyone on here has already made the exact same point so i'll keep it brief. This ""strategy guide"" is a travesty, I usually buy the guides to all FF games, to help unlock secrets, hidden areas, items and sub-plots, I never use the walkthrough. The guides for FF7 & 8 were superb so I had no reason to think this would be otherwise, how wrong I was.The walkthrough is probably great, however I dont use it, everything I bought the guide for though is useless, it gives me a password and tells me to go to play online. Now back in 2001 when this came out, I wasn't even online, and even if I was to pay 12.99 for this is a joke.Thankfully the FF10 guide was great again, so i'm presuming the feedback they got from this experiment was not good, avoid this guide like the plague."
2,This book is great...,"...for people who spend half there lives online trying to figure out the game they just bought instead of playing it and enjoying it. I bought this guide because I couldn't even get on the website. Imagine my dismay when every page has a link to the site so you can find information that should have been in the book in the first place. If Bradygames is going to continue with this ""new"" style of strategy guides in the future, then they've lost me as a customer."
2,Not what I was looking for,"If you are looking to pass the game this book is probably for you. But if you have played RPG games before, like to explore, and want to get the guide for the extras that is impossible to find without reading it from somewhere then this aren't it. The strategy goes on telling you what to do but when it comes to getting secret it has a side note telling you to go look online at the squaresoft page...."
3,Not Worth The Money,"Although the book has all the bestiary and items, it gives weak walkthroughs. What I mean is, it lightly goes over some events and plugs its website, playonline.com. What I mean is, it will briefly go over an event, then say: ""For more information on ------ go to playonline."" This happens about four or five times every two pages, so if you're stuck, you have to go online & print out these hints. The worst part about this is that that site is always down from all the people trying to get the rest of the info. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but if you have to print out game hints, what's the use of buying the guide? However, I gave it 3 stars because of the other information that goes along with the game (excluding the walkthrough.)"
4,Final fantasy nine strategy guide,Its a decent guide but they could have done a little better... and the hints to go online to get more info are a little distracting and make for a problem if you cannot go online.... but push come to shove its an alright guide....
1,Websites are better,"This book is annoying in that all of the information of the game isn't in it, they make you go online, login, then you hafta type in a code, and THEN they tell you what to do in the game with a *few* pictures. I hate having to leave the room when playing a game to go online, which is why i would purchase a strat guide so I wouldn't have to go look on webpages!! Frustrating!"
1,"Not a guide to FF9, but a guide to PlayOnline","This book is supposed to be a strategy guide for Final Fantasy IX. I bought it expecting to be told where all the hidden secrets are and a detailed walkthrough of the game. Instead, I get paragraphs telling me, ""There's a secret hidden item in this town that very valuable to have. For more information, go to PlayOnline."" NO! I DIDN'T PAY $12.00 TO BE TOLD TO FIND OUT ONLINE!! I say we boycott this book and show whoever is responsible that we don't appreciate being tricked. This book should at least tell its customers that if they don't have internet access or don't feel like signing-on every 2 minutes to find out the information you paid to have in print, then this book is USELESS!! A definite bomb!"
2,"Layout is decent, but the content is not helpful","When I pay extra ... for a strategy guide of a game, I want it to show everything. That means all of the items, characters, secrets, and weapons, ect. Unfortunately, that is not what this strategy guide offers. It introduces you to the basics and that's about it. Other than that, it does little more than point you in the right direction. There are tons of references to the website Play Online, which does have everything about FF9 on it...but what's the point in buying a strategy guide when all of the information is already available online? Unless you just want some extra reading material, just wait for an unofficial strategy guide to come out, or go to Play Online if you have internet access."
1,Yuck!,"This is the worst guide I have ever come across. It may help you get through the game, but when you get to things you really need information or help on, it tells you to go to PlayOnline.com. You basically need to be sitting next your computer when you play this game so you can stop every five seconds and go online. It is one of the stupidest things I have seen. I would not recommend this to anyone. Your best bet, is to go online to and print out the walkthrough there. At least it includes everything you want to know."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,This guide tells you absolutely nothing except to go online for more info. Load of crap. If I wanted an online guide I would not have bought a paper one. This is a waste of your money AND your time. BUYER BEWARE!!
1,Terrible,"This guide is TERRIBLE! Do not buy it! The PlayOnline makes part is needed to do ANYTHING! The problem is, the playonline site doesn't even work anymore!"
1,This is horrible!,"This book is a piece of garbage. Probably the only sentences in this book are ""for more info on so and so please go to Playonline.com"". Don't waste your money on this thing. Just go to gamefaqs.com and download the walkthrough. This is worth nothing."
2,What strategy is included?,"I just received the strategy guide last night, but when I looked through the beginning sections of the book, I found a disturbing problem. The writer decided to use the new PlayOnline.com site as a crutch so he didn't have to include a lot of information in the book itself. For most topics you will find little notes on the side of the page saying ""For more detailed information on ... goto PlayOnline.com."" I really don't understand what happened this time."
2,Buy only if you don't have a computer!,"The title should be a moot point, because you obviously have a computer if you are reading this. So, don't buy this! Why? The game is certainly hard and worthy of a few pointers here and there. But (and this is significant), this is the single most frustrating guide I've used. Here's a good example, let's say you want to get to the boss of Disc 1. The guide will do a good job of how to get to the boss, but then do you know what happens? It will say ""for strategy to defeat this boss, go to PlayOnline!"". This website is certainly comprehensive, and even more so than the $10 guide itself. The website is free and printable, so just spend 30 minutes printing out the walkthrough, and you will much better off than wasting your money on this guide. However, both have a major problem in that they contain major plot spoilers, so be warned. Awesome game, terrible guide."
2,"I thought I was buying a strategy guide, not a hyperlink.","I have pretty much the same gripes as everyone else. Although the Internet is faster, more widespread, and more reliable than when this guide was first released, I still don't approve of essentially half of the guide being on PlayOnline. It's a nuisance to have to stop in the course of a game, and it takes the information away from your fingertips. Aren't you entitled to have the full guide in front of you at all times, seeing as you paid for it? I think so.The bestiary is also very lacking, so much that I don't even refer to it. The descriptions of boss battles seem thrown together at the last minute, and they don't really offer much insight. There is a wealth of information about the game in here, so the guide isn't worthless, but I still would have liked a much better one."
3,S'Okay,"This strategy guide leaves a lot to be desired. If you are a clueless gamer it can be quite helpful. You really need some sort of Internet connection for this guide to be of any GOOD value. It can be very vague in areas and the fact that almost ALL OF THE GOOD INFO is online makes it loose a lot of points. But it will help you get from area to area, and allows you to pick up secret characters that you might not find otherwise. It's your decision. Do you need it? Or not?"
1,Bad even for a Bradygames guide,"And those are usually known for making Gampro articles look good by comparison. This, however, hits new lows. If I'd wanted to pay 13 dollars for an advertisement for a slow (even on my cable modem) website that still doesn't cover all the information on the game, I would be happy with this. As it is, I'm checking faqs posted on Gamefaqs.com to find secrets on my second trip through the game. The art isn't even that good in most of the book, they use the same renders of the characters on literally almost every page. A few pages use some nice preliminary art, but nothing you can't find in the art book. Save your money and go to Gamefaqs, and buy the ""Art of Final Fantasy IX"" book if you want the art. Avoid this insulting pile of tripe like the plague."
1,A complete waste of money and paper,"This guide is horrible. All of BradyGames other strategy guides are superb, but this one falls horribly short. If I could have I would have given it a zero. The PlayOnline.com website contains all the information in the guide and then some. Save yourself the $15 and just print out the website. But even the website is not of a complete help. They only have one map, the world map, that's it. It is absolutely no help with the chocobo part of the game."
2,Don't waste your money on this,"I was very disappointed by the FF IX Strategy Guide. Brady Games and SquareSoft seem to have written this book more to push the PlayOnline game website rather than helping players with the game.Everytime I'd try to find information about something the strategy guide would tell me to log onto Play Online and enter a keyword in order to learn more.When I buy a strategy guide, I expect to find the answers there, not be told to go access a website. This guide was practically useless."
1,Ripped off,"I wish I'd saved my money. The detailed info I was looking for is on their web site, not in this ""guide"". It's just an excuse to send traffic to their site ..."
1,A Complete Waste Of Money,"The fact that this strategy guide is tied so closely to Squares-Enix's PlayOnline website may have been beneficial back when it was first published. Almost every advanced strategy for the game is encapsulated in a footnote that reads, ""Want to know how to beat X? Go to PlayOnline.com and enter KEYWORD:Y""Now that the game is no longer considered relevent by the company, though, all traces of the supplimental material have been removed from the website. This renders the guide nearly useless apart from a very basic walkthrough and a beastiary.If you truly need a guide for help getting through Final Fantasy IX, you'd be much better served by searching for a game FAQ online."
5,Excellent reference,"This book takes you from the basics to very advanced activities. Anyone who is serious about creating custom report solutions should implement SQL RS and use this book. It will help you through step-by-step ""how-to"" to create an extremely professional result. Reporting Services is fairly new to the public. Only now are books of this nature becoming available. This one is the best!"
5,Enjoyable and Informative Reading,"The beautiful and unique images of tigers captured in the wild were breathtaking. I found the format of this book interesting and useful in acquiring reliable knowledge about Patera tigris and related species, though this book is not oriented for the scientific community. Mr. Thapar has revealed some aspects of tiger behavior that very much suprised me... and I hold a degree in Biology. The author tends to end the book on a dark personal note underscoring the tiger's grim future, but I don't think anyone with an interest in animal conversation would mind Mr. Thapar's effort to impart to us his tireless passion for these critically endangered big cats."
5,Great quality,Very well made both in function and cosmetics. All my pots and pans fit over the hook and rest on the loop perfectly.
1,Don't buy it!,"The company that developed this product is out of business. What you are going to receive is some leftover junk that requires a ""patch"" to operate. The product doesn't do nearly the job advertised. The ""Pro"" version is no different than the standard version and neither will record audio streams from sources such as Rhapsody.I have no problem with the seller. He didn't know."
5,Outstanding program,"I love Audio Xtract Pro! Finally I can listen to music that I haven't heard in years on the radio simply by searching the music genre that I would like to hear at that particular time, and then streaming the audio. I love that you can save the songs you wish to, all the while having the capabilites of burning it to a CD within the same program."
2,"iTunes, Launch and More","I own this app and it's awesome! I literally filled an MP3 player in one afternoon with new MP3s using Audio Xtract on my PC. I recorded 6 streams at 128kbs and it was amazing! Then I moved it all to my player, no problem there either.The exciting part is that I just got an email from their support that a new pro version is coming for the holidays that records literally anything, including iTunes and all the internet radio streams out there. They said updates are free, so no need to wait I guess to get free music."
1,Dullest anime ever made!,"I'm lucky i didn't actually buy this crap! If I had, id probably just have recycled it or used the discs as frisbees. I saw this series (at least the first 7 episodes, which is way more than i could stomach) online. It was so awful and beyond the worst anime series or movie I've ever seen. I guess they're trying to make learning history ""cute"" or wtf ever you wana say about it but I just found it to be a pathetic excuse to make a series and make money off of it. I've watched 100's of anime series and anime movies in my life, being a fan since the early 90's, I've never seen anything THIS stupid! I don't recommend this junk to anyone. It's NOT funny and it's not cute, its lame and idk who would buy this, on purpose!"
4,Jose Silva: A Blend Of Other Suggestionists,"Can you imagine the answer, recommendation, remedy or solution? If you can, you will likely turn that mental visualization into reality sooner or later. As Emile Coue says, Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better, or as Jose Silva would say, Better, better, and better. Jose Silva's association of brainwaves (beta, alpha, theta, and delta) with varying degrees of concentration (along the lines of an outer world vs an inner world) is enlightening. Apparently Silva's techniques work for some and not for others."
3,Must use gloves with these chunky grips,"These are reasonably comfortable grips, don't spin on the bar, and are durable, but you must use gloves with them. Their smooth surface gets very slippery with hand sweat if you are working hard and it is at all warm.If you always use gloves (I don't), and like thicker grips (I don't really care), then these are pretty good. Otherwise, there are better options."
1,Extremely poorly written,"This book was so annoying that after three separate attempts to read it, I threw it in the trash. I wouldn't even donate it to my library book sale because I can't subject anyone else to the horrible, awkward, childish writing of Carlene Thompson. No one in the world would ever talk like she writes. Horrible, awful, terrible book. The story line may have been good, but who could tell based on the terrible writing? I pity the reader who buys this utter garbage."
4,Works for my wide head,"My head is wide, my friends say that my forehead is more like an Eight Head.I tried two swim caps, both silicone, the TYR cap in bright red, and this cap in the Blue Green. The TYR was too tight for me. The Speedo Composite actually fit my head pretty well. I have short hair and I wet it in the shower before I go swimming. If you have longer hair or a different shaped head, you have to try it, but that's assumed.I took one star off simply because it's not long enough to cover my ears, but it partially covers the tops of my ears, so I fold the cap back a little. Doesn't affect comfort, but it doesn't look as sleek.I think the Blue Green combo is pretty cool, better than a boring solid color. I'm swimming in a sprint triathlon soon, so I like the bright colors when I swim in a lake surrounded by hundreds of other crazed swimmers."
3,No real hard info.,"If you're going through IVF, you'll appreciate the humor and candor of this tiny little paperback. But if you need hard facts and technical info, this book doesn't have it. Sort of a waste of a read, unless you just need to know someone else feels the way you do."
3,Beware in Winter,"An Excellent indoor lock. The changeable combination is nice for those like me with a poor short-term memory. I can use my favorite numeric combination.Still, I live in Alaska, and the weather is not the best. I guess there are just too many moving parts inside, but any time I tried using it outside, it kept freezing up. Makes it hard to get back in the house! Regular keyed padlocks have not yet let me down.Again, a great lock, if you can keep it from freezing."
4,Good solid locks,Well engineered and the tumblers work with ease although a little sticky to line up in wet weatherResetting codes to match is really easy
1,Worst book ever!,Don't ever read this book or take Chinese History where you will be forced to read this book. I can't tell Hsiang Tzu from Sang Wu.
5,great powder,"This is a great powder with great coverage and helps control oil. Be sure to apply a good primer before applying, as with all mineral base."
1,Fell apart,"The powder was all cracked and crumbled when it arrived. I tried to still use it, but it gets all over everything else in my makeup bag and goes on too heavily. Very disappointed."
5,Like a tape recorder for the internet,This software really rocks. I can set the program to record music all day long and just let it go. I come home and my hard drive is full. You can record 8 stations at a time which is very helpful if you want alot of music in a short period of time.
5,Not as good as the original Monopoly but a lot of fun!,My grandson recieved this game although he is only 7 years old. I love monopoly but haven't played it for quite a while and I love Las Vegas so it was a win win. There is an hour version of this game and we played it a couple of times. It's a really great game and nice if you don't want to play all night.Buy It.M. Luley
1,Use Lippincott's instead,"This is not a very good book. Although this is a medical biochemistry book, this is inadequate for medical school. Many topics are covered in great detail when they don't need to be, while others are neglected when they should be emphasized. In short, it does not teach to the NBME biochemistry shelf exam or USMLE Step 1. Although it is the second edition, it is riddled with errors, unclear grammar, and inaccurate figures. There are also some topics where this book is just plain wrong. Who thought it would be a good idea to have a bunch of biochemists write a medical text? Get something else; anything else."
3,Rensaissance,"This a nice book of good quality on a wonderful subject. It provides a quick overview of some the the most famous Renaissance buildings such as, St. Peter's and Fontainbleau. It is not an indepth book, but the text is informitive, if not exactly scholarly, I mean that in no disrespect to the author, I realize this is meant to be a quick overview and so many buildings are coverd it would be virtually impossible to give each of them comprehensive coverage. The photographs are first rate and the pictures are vivid. I recommend this to anyone who wants a book that is quality and that covers all the famous buildings of the Renaissance. If you are looking for deep text maybe this is not right for you, but for most this will all they need and be a wonderful addition to there book collection."
2,Well written but.....,"Sorry, I must disagree. Yes this book was well written, and yes the program samples were nicely layed out, but the whole scheme was not a practicle learning tool. The majority of the internet protocols were handled by the demo ocx called dssock32.ocx. I did not see any code of this ocx, well perhpas bits and chunks but nothing that could be of use. This book showed how to become reliant on someone elses hard work without giving you, the programmer, the ability to create your own internet applications. I would suggest this book to everyone if they are looking for a well written book that lacks in practicalities in the programming world."
3,"Works, but noisy","The fans work as advertised, but it's somewhat noisy if you allow the fans to run at full speed. I had to also buy a fan speed controller to slow it down to get the noise under control (since it is used in a home theater pc). I do like the fact that it has a washable filter that can be removed by sliding the faceplace up/down after it's installed."
2,doesn't stick very well.,"this item does not doesn't stick very well and i'm using it on a flat surface on the ground, so it has gravity on it's side and still sticks bad"
2,Earrings,"Way wider than the picture suggests, also the post comes down farther than the bottom of the earring giving an odd appearance to the jewelry when worn."
1,"don't publish this, its not a review","hey guys, standards are slipping here.this is not a mystery book--this is early science fiction.and, elizabeth peters is not englihs, she's american, and the mitchell book is about a comanche, on a reservation--definitely NOT english.you need a better editor here."
1,Get what you pay for,"In theory a sub-$15 reel that works is a good deal, even if the gear ratio is a bit low and the retrieve isn't perfect. I used my first one of these guys maybe 6 times before it lost the ability to cast. I picked up another one figuring, hey, it's cheap and the first time was probably a fluke. Wrong. My second one lasted only 3 trips before breaking. I really don't know why Shimano would sully their reputation with this kind of product, but that's certainly what they've done. Stay away from this guy--spend another $15 and pick up something decent."
3,Doesn't Do Well With an Learner Who Has Never Used Filemaker...,"I found this book spotty in its development.As another reviewer wrote, you'll need to buy a magnifying glass to see the computer screen images in this book-No Joke!"
5,Tutorial at it's best,"This is the best Computer tutotial book that I ever bought, and I buy quite a few. This is the kind of book you read & work with from cover to cover and come back to all the time."
2,Why latins are the worst??!!,Movies about latins always enphasize their bad behaviors. Why can't a movie be about the good ones like FRIDA!
1,What was Abel Ferrara smoking?,"This movie is horrible. The story, the acting, the directing. Just horrible."
3,The refill is sentient,"Received this ink refill today. Initial use determined that the refill was rough and unpleasant to write with and wrote like it was out of ink. As I continued to scribble and began to write my Amazon review, the ink started flowing and writing improved. Now writing experience has become much smoother. Unsure if this will continue after I submit this review."
5,Finally a great pooper-scooper.,"We have three dogs, so finding a good way to dispose of their waste was pretty important to us. This scooper and rake works beautifully. It is sturdy enough to last and clever enough to get what it needs to get. I recommend it heartily."
4,Hillarious,"I thought this book was GREAT and a huge help in zeoring in on my cluttering problem. It helped me evaluate how I accumulate STUFF, and gave me the OK to re-evaluate, trash, donate, recycle, relocate and re-gift things that would probably be HERE forever. I also learned some great decorating and storage tips. It's been a fun trip to ordiliness! Thanks, Di"
3,Not always realistic,"The author does a great job of being a cheerleader to people who are battling clutter in their lives. The quiz and explainations in the beginning make people feel like their habits are somehow normal or personality/emotionally based rather than a result of their choices or lifestyles. Some of the information is valid - ideas on organizations or resources who might be able to put your no longer needed stuff to good use, for example. Unfortunately, much of the advice is either common sense or unrealistic (rolling jewelry around paper tubes to keep it from getting tangled). I recommend getting the book from the library, reading the first couple chapters, and then moving on to another resource."
2,So-So,"Seems like this lotion is pretty average; however, it comes with a poor dispenser, so I think an unecessarily large amount of the product will go to waste. It's an okay lotion - but overpriced, and the bottle is small."
1,This software is junk,"I would not recommend tracking your finances with this software.When it works as it's supposed to, it's fine. The problem comes when you invest all of your precious time to enter your financial data, and then one of it's serious bugs causes it to become unusable.I can't edit my paychecks now (not even change the date) because it will tell me that any edit will cause one of my 401K account balances to become negative at some point in the future. This is nonsense, of course.Also, it crashes anytime I try to download a statement from anywhere.I am so angry now I can't see straight (over a decade of financial records in Money and now it's junk). I surfed Microsoft's website, and I can't even find anywhere where I can send an e-mail complaint."
1,Stay Away,"This is the first time that I've felt strongly enough about a product to write a review. I've been using this software for about 2 weeks and I've decided to go back to the 2004 version, which will be painful since the file format has changed. I've been using Money for years, and prior upgrades have been worth the price, but this version is a constant source of irritation. I've also decided that I don't want my financial information on a Microsoft Web Site is required. If it were possible I've give this one negative 5 stars."
1,"As if 2004 was bad enough, 2005 takes the lead","So, after being an idiot and upgrading to 2004, I thought 2005 would be an improvement. Yes, I am a mega-idiot to think there are any improvements other than requirement to login to .net, there is no way to select categories as previously release where you could put in category, then type..(and no way to change it). I won't parrot the other reviews. They got the nail on the head. My next upgrade will be to Quicken."
1,I should've read this before I bought Money 05,"I've been a happy user of Money 99 and later Money 04 with absolutely no issues. Well, except that my wife would never enter her receipts. The answer? Money 05 could import it all.Since installing this it has worked ok. The reason I hate is becuase A. It's slow. It appears to be collaborating with Passport too much to back up everything you do. But even worse, on three occassions I've had it go haywire. It added duplicate accounts, merged other accounts, screwed up balances, etc.The way it imports transactions is bad too. The payee names are never there but rather an address. Change it to the name and the next time you synchronize it will show that transaction as a duplicate with the re-downloaded version with no name.Bugs Bugs Bugs. I think I will clean it all up, back up to floppy, uninstall, and reinstall 04.No more money for Microsoft from me.Do not buy this and be very skeptical of Money 06. i should've read the reviews on this before."
4,Good remix tracks from early A-Ha,"I originally had this material (with the exception of the Take On Me remix) on a 12"" single. ""Driftwood"" is a decent but disposable B-side, the instrumental ""Sun Always Shines..."" is interesting, but the real treasure is the 12"" of ""Sun..."". The percussion is hopped up a little *too* much, but overall it is a solid track that will get everyone moving. Definitely worth pursuing if you are any sort of A-Ha fan. The sound quality suffers slightly over the original vinyl (fancy that), but not enough to detract from the overall effect. The ""Take On Me"" remix is fun, but nothing to write home about."
5,Great to learn,I love the book it is great because when you want to find how to sign something as long as you know what it begins with it is easy to look up and figure out how to do it.
1,Unnecessarily complicated,"""Easy Transfer"" - It sounds simply enough. Instead this product makes transferring your files from your old computer a lot more complicated than it needs to be. The process to get it set up properly was overly complicated and you are extremely restricted in how you transferred files. You have to select files and folders using check boxes, instead of being able to just drag and drop files to the new computer. Also, when your computers are transferring they are unaccessible and it is difficult to interrupt the transfer process.If you have a router (wired/wireless), it would be much easier to transfer across the network using shared folders. I found that this process (which I've done several times before) is less cumbersome and works just as quickly as the Easy Transfer Cable."
1,Didn't work for me!,"Our older XP Home PC has been the family PC for several years. When I built our new Vista PC, I thought that I had found the perfect solution to automate the job of transferring our files and settings. But no...I'm sure the cable works OK mechanically, but the Windows Easy Transfer Wizard was simply a dud. It never successfully completed a transfer of all of our files from one PC to the other, and I tried for several days using every combination of settings.Again, I don't blame Belkin, but Microsoft's wizard tool simply wasn't up to the challenge. I ended up re-installing Vista from disk at one point because my daughter couldn't even logon under her id. At that point, I decided to call it quits.I hooked up both PCs to our router and manually transferred the files over the network. Applications like MS Office, Quicken, etc, I reinstalled from disk. Slow and manual, but much more satisfying in the end."
1,Misleading Description,"The description of this product states that it will work with Windows 2000. It does not. Even after contacting the vendor, who said it would work with Service Pack 4 installed on Windows 2000. It does not, it won't even install itself. Very poor product, don't waste your money."
2,A one-way street,Only works when you want to copy files from an older PC to a Vista PC. It even asks you if you want to transfer from the newer PC but it doesn't work!
1,Cable to ransfer data,I thought this was to transfer date from XP to Win 7. But looks like it is for Vista. Guess I will get the proper item. can't rate the item as not used.
3,COMPLETE Instructions,"Belkin Easy Transfer Cable**If you are transferring between two (2) desktop PCs... you need to have two (2) monitors OR keep switching the monitor cable between the two (2) PCs as needed.The procedure is to:* Install the included software on your XP PC* Run Easy Transfer on XP PC* Connect your XP PC to your new Vista PC with the cable* Vista PC will automatically detect the connection and ask if you want to run Easy Transfer* Select Run Easy Transfer on Vista PC* On XP PC select: (a) files you want to transfer, and (b) where on Vista PC you want to save files"
5,Works Great,Not much to say except that this product does what it says it does. I transferred about 10 gigs of music from a desktop to a laptop with ease. Just follow the directions.
2,very disappointed...................,"Nothing I have tried will make this product work, calls to belkin; call to Microsoft; pc magazine....it just is not worth the time or money. sorry"
1,double trouble,"This caused me more problems than I ever thought I could have. The interface is absolutely no help at all. It transfers slowly, without telling you what , where, or how it is doing. You have no idea if it is even transferring. It stalled for over an hour, no messages, no idea of what it was doing, just a warning that ""IF YOU CLOSE THIS WINDOW OR USE YOUR COMPUTER YOU WILL HAVE TO START OVER"". With no activity displayed from either hard drive, I spent the day starting and stopping the program. It finally transfered without hangup about 2 in the morning. Now my new computer has more folders in the dangdest places than I thought you could put on it. Stay away from this cable and the software. I could have transfered all the files using dvd or cd quicker and more efficiently than this piece of junk. Stay away!"
1,Transfer Cable,Cable did not work would not load on my windows XP to transfer to Vista Your Technical support was no help. They just gave me a drive to load. which I already had. I had to transfer my file using a zip drive.do not waste your Money I did.
1,Don't buy it,"I spent most of one day trying to get this to work, calling Belkin's helpless desk in some third world country, who spoke broken English. I was trying to move my files (not programs) & settings from a windows XP to a windows Vista computer. Save your time & money, use the windows vista software that comes with the computer, and some kind of storage & transfer device (flash, CD's, portable hard drive). I returned it. Should have paid more attention to the ratings !"
1,I shouldn't have wasted the money,"I bought the Belkin Easy Transfer cable to switch from an XP computer to a Vista computer. I loaded the software and connnected the two computers and followed the directions. Within about 10 minutes the system appeared to be ""hung up."" However, I had no way of knowing if any progress was being made. The light was still flashing on the Transfer Cable and I did not receive any error messages. I left the two machines hooked up for hours before I abandoned the process and tried to call Belkin, which was not available at the time I was calling. I ended up buying an external hard drive and transferring my files using the hard drive instead of the Belkin Easy Transfer Cable. The cable was a waste of money."
2,Belkin Transfer Cable,"I could not get the cable to funtion during the easy file transfer process between my new computer running vista and my old running xp. I followed the directions, etc.. and it did not function as advertised. Very dissapointed.."
1,Easy Transfer non-transfer,"My rating for this product is not for the cable itself, but for the braindead Microsoft Easy Transfer application when using the ET Cable. On my XP system I had user data on the 'D' Partition. In Vista the 'D' partition is used for some Vista system recovery stuff. When you use the Easy Transfer application with the ET Cable it moves data from where ever you had it on the source system (XP in my case)to the corresponding location on the target (Vista) system. The 'D' partition size in Vista is 10 GB, about 7 GB of which is used, so after transferring approx 3 GB of data you get a filespace error.When you use removable media (e.g., CD, thumb drive) you evidently get a choice of where to put the data on the target system but not when the ET Cable is used,If you have data on the 'D' partition on your source system, save yourself the $30.00 for the cable and invest it in a 4GB or 8GB thumb drive."
4,Exactly as expected,"My daughter wanted a bottle for her doll, and I remembered these ""magic"" bottles from my childhood. They are just as I remembered them, magic enough for children but with some amusing side effects as the fluids flow up the narrow walls. Fine for kids, and my daughter loves them. A nice touch that they come as a milk and juice set.Absolutely fine for the price, recommended."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but I am going to buy more right now. I bought this for our 1 year old grandson, but the 5 year old grandson loves it as well. I am very impressed and we love it!"
5,5 Star Review,This book is very instrumental in providing detailed information on implementing the supported employment model. The book is comprehensive and gives plenty of real life examples. A must read if you're in the employment developing field.
2,Please make complete season's !,Ok TZ is one of my all time favorite shows but I would'nt buy this set for one thing the episodes are not in chronologcal order nor are they organized by season. I would much rather own The Twilight Zone season one than a random best of. Also I think that viacom could spend a little more time and package episodes differantly. A whole season could easily fit on three or four discs. Personally I think the ninety dollars that you pay is based on the weight of the package. I think that a good box set should cost somewhere between thirty to fifty dollars but not much more!
5,Great Read,I read this book when it first came out and it was my favorite book on OJ trial. I ordered this for a paper and enjoyed re-reading it.
1,Where's the music Steve?,"If there is one word to describe this album, it would be definitely ""crap"". I loved Steve Stevens' work with Billy Idol. I thought he had style, but this album broke the illusion big time. Song are lousy and there is no music at all! Couple of nice soundeffects and that's it. Lack of direction is main concept of this album. If you want to ruin your friend's birthday, give him this album."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I have always loved Steve Stevens' guitar playing with Billy Idol and believe that he is under-rated, but this album really bites the big one! The songwriting is downright amateurish and Stevens doesn't get a chance to shred the way he obviously can. I'd like to see what he could do in a Jeff Beck-Blow By Blow type of context. Here, it sounds like he has recycled songs that weren't good enough to make it onto a Motley Crue disc (and that ain't good!). The singer makes Vince Neil sound like Paul Rodgers. Save your money and get Rebel Yell by Billy Idol."
5,Keeps my daughter busy,"Very colorful with lots of pieces to explore. My 5 month old daughter likes to put the plastic disks in her mouth and to finger the crinkly pieces. When we put her on the floor with her toys, she'll go for this one first and it keeps her busy for some time."
4,Good for my money,"VERY inexpensive and decent quality for what I paid. I didn't really use it for the class I bought it for, but I'm glad I didn't waste a lot of money on another book. Shipped fast."
1,This costume was a rip off!,My son had wanted this costume for Halloween for two years so I ordered it for this past Halloween. It came and he was so excited that is until he discovered the rip on the side and the fact that it was supposed to be glow in the dark and it did NOT glow. I sat the costume in the sun for a full day and it still did not glow. This costume was a HUGE disappointment!
4,Good costume,"My son loved it. It fit well and was a hit. The only complain i had was that it tore really easy. But for the price it was worth it and was a quick fix,"
2,Nobel What?,I lived in Istanbul for some years and expected to find in this book something--anything--that told me what the place was about or what I missed.The answer is very little indeed. For those who like kitchen drama--i.e. what Baby Orhan liked or did not like; what his mother thought of him when she thought at all; what his father never thought when he was out philandering--this should be a satisfying book. For the rest of us--I just don't know. We tend to think that most of it belongs on FaceBook. And nowhere else.Read Pamuk's fiction. It's generally quite good. Forget this piece of gross self-indulgence.P.S. It's also high priced for an ebook.
1,So-so,"Istanbul is a truly fascinating city, and the book covers Pamuk's personal memories of it since childhood, and its transformation from the decadent seat of Ottoman power into one of Europe's most astonishingly beautiful and modern cities. What I regret is Pamuk's writing style which frequently veers off into historical minutiea that is a challenge to plod through, but if one skips those parts, he does shed an interesting light on life in Istanbul prior to the mass exodus of it's Greek inhabitants, and how their departure impoverished Turkey culturally in many ways. The Istanbul he depicts is a grey sombre place, caught in the cold-war struggle between the superpowers, living on a lost glorious past, contrary to what it is today. The inclusion of more personal memories would have added warmth and enhanced the book, which in its present state resembles a long rambling lecture by an old historian."
1,VHS quality footage with TERRIBLE SOUND,"I like this band a lot, but this DVD is a rip off. The sound is muffled and absolutely horrible. The footage is ok, but I couldn't get past the sound problems. I would definitely stick with the live cannibalism DVD."
4,TENDER BEAUTY,"Some deliciously different music even in its most blatantly nostalgic (Elvis, Roy Orbison) moments. For tender beauty, nothing here comes close to the title track where his voice soars an falters in an immaculate outpouring of emotion to create the most poignant love ballad of the time. One half hopes for more fast rockers because it's obvious that he doesn't really need to be only a crooner - with that voice and style he could have become a hot rock 'n roller."
4,The Twilight Zone,"Every New Year's Eve I watch the twilight zone with my family on Sci-Fi. I instatly fell in love with this collection. Now in school we are studying science fiction and we watched ""Time Enough At Last"" and are currently reding ""The Monsters Are On Maple Street"" and proforming it like a play. Now to have this collection in my own home to view at any time I want is just a joy."
1,BORING!!,"The prologue is amazing -- the description of the scene had me hooked and I eagerly bought the book. I anxiously started reading as soon as I got home. Good at first, but the further I read, the more boring it got. The first 25 pages of Part 2 are a complete rehashing of what we just read in Part 1. Maybe the author was aware that he was putting his readers to sleep and felt he had to remind them of what they had read before their nap. The main character is a complete moron. I was so irritated that I skimmed the final 100 pages, not caring what happened to our ""hero."" Be warned - ""Boy in the Water"" is all wet."
3,"Good - but ""Church"" left my expectations too high","If you've come to this book because you enjoyed ""Church of the Dead Girls"" so much, then you'll find this one a little lacking in spirit.I liked the dismally cloistered prep school setting, and the author's prose is inventive. However, the tone was more sour than ""Church"" and I found the dancing 15-year-old segment more than a little overwritten, with everything spelled out that might have been inferred, and nothing left unstated....If you get my drift."
2,All Over the Map,"(This is a review of the Kindle edition.)The author has unquestionably done a lot of work on researching the history and personalities involved in the anthrax killings. The problem I had with this book was how unevenly it plays out. It jumps from a fairly good narrative true crime story to a poorly written overly detailed look at topics that are barely relevant to the story. Most irritating were the numerous repetitions of facts and quotes, as if the author were being paid by the word or presumed that the reader could not retain simple facts from one chapter to the next. The narrative is choppy and jumps back and forth across time more than is really necessary.I bought it as a reader with an interest in human response in disasters, not as a professional researcher. It may be useful to keep as a reference to refresh my memory on facts, but it is not what I would consider an enjoyable and informative narrative in the genre of true crime."
2,Hits?,"This anthology is peculiar. Not exactly greatest hits or even favorites. The sequencing is odd, as well. Too bad the original greatest hits package is unavailable on CD in the United States as that was far superior."
4,Just an Intro of Great talents,"There is in fact an issue of the early ""Greatest Hits"" compilation in print on CD right now. But, it's only avaible as a pricy import.Anywho, this is just a groovy sampler of their years between 1972-1980. What keeps this from becoming a 5 star CD is the missing songs ""Dirty Work"", ""Josie"", and ""Aja"". In this, there is only ""Kid Charlemagne"" from their brillent, yet underrated recording of The Royal Scam. Indeed, what is going on with the annoying ""Babylon Sisters""? Otherwise, this is a great way for beginners to listen to one of the most innovtive and artistic musicians selection of catchier compositions. From the tight R&B;/Jazz ""FM"" to the ending with a high note on the sweet ""Bad Sneakers"". This is for those who who need a good introduction of this band and are willing to try some real talent when image didn't matter to sell good recordings. Also get the masterpiece ""Aja"" and Donald Fagan's brillant debut as a solo artist ""the Nightfly"". Rock on!"
5,"That funky, glorious 70's feel.","This album is a wonderful laid-back compilation of the incredible sounds of Steely Dan from 1972 to 1981, which graced so many parties and poolside sunbathing during the Golden Age of the 1970's and beyond.Each song runs nicely into the next, as jazzy melodies, or rythymmed disco hits.My personal favorites are F.M (1978), Bodhisattva (1980), Deacon Blues (1978), Hey Nineteen (1980), Rikki Don't Lose That Number (1974) and the classic Reelin' In The Years (1972).This is classic modern jazz at it's very best, and some of the best music of it's time.Always with that funky, glorious 70's feel."
4,Great party background music,"I played this album during a party, and my husband, who has a more heavy metal taste in music, and who never gives my music a listen, thought it was great. He thought it lent the perfect mood for conversation."
3,Too bad....,"Great blade...horrible balance- they shouldn't have skimped with the handle, the blade deserves more. Feels like a great blade with a cheap handle...hence not exactly the ergonomic feel I would expect for the price....waste of a seemingly great blade.."
2,The books deserve better movies.,I understand the authors deeply regret selling the movie rights because the movies were so poorly made. I have to agree and hope one day the books will be made into better quality movies.
2,Low-Budget Movies Undermine Brilliant Books,"Objectively, these movies lack quality; consequently, they only serve to satisfy those who are predisposed to support them, even if out of obligation to encourage more like-minded efforts. However, if the purpose was to proselytize, then the movies should have had the budget and quality necessary to attract the targeted audience. As it turned out, it appears the purpose was to make a quick buck off low-budget films that do not serve justice to the authors. Unlike the successful Christian music industry, Christian movies will not reach the ""other side"" until they are made with such quality as to rival any competing movie on a Friday night. First and foremost, people watch movies to be entertained....to entertain while sending a Christian message is still a skill to be honed."
5,Very informational,"These movies were GREAT! They give you a great idea of how the world will be when the events will actually take place. The acting was very good also for an independant film. I recommend this to everyone, especially if you are having trouble understanding what will happen when the AntiChrist takes over and the people are taken before Tribulation. I just purchased the book but have not started it yet, I heard that they are very good and more informative."
5,Outstanding,The collection is outstanding. The acting improves with each movie. The message is solid throughout. Jesus Christ is the one and only way.
4,Excellent!!!!,I read all the Left Behind books in a whirlwind. I found the movies just as exciting. I watched all three back to back. Very moving and genuine. Should bring everyone to their knees - praise God! I hope more Christian-based movies are released.
2,But I loved the books ...,"This was a nice try, but it was a very cheap attempt. I know movies can never reproduce every scene in a book, and often have to change things to convey the feel of the story. But the feel of the movies is nowhere near as intense or emotional as the books. They were ok, but the books were way better."
1,I feel cheated,"WARNING! This is NOT the version with the brand new global scenery you see on the X-Plane website! This is version 8.00, and the new scenery started with version 8.20. You can download the latest version of the flight engine itself (version 8.50 at the time of this writing), but Laminar will not upgrade the scenery for you if you buy this orphan. I bought this, didn't get what I was expecting, and thinking there was something wrong with the way I was installing it I let my 30 days to return it run out.X-Plane is a great simulator and I would recommend it wholeheartedly. However, Amazon should not be selling this version which is obsolete and not supported by the developers. If you want the nice graphics (who doesn't?), get the 7 DVD version."
1,"Victorian Double handle Kitchen Faucet...,,,disapointing","The faucet is so pretty, but when the plumber installed it, the faucet sprayer leaks, making the faucet sound like its pumping air. After talking to the plumber, he said its not a good quality faucet, and best to get a different one. He said there is a mechinism missing internally, and that is why it sucks in air and makes that horrible thumping sound. And with the gasket leaking in the sprayer, no way to fix that. I must say I am disapointed in the quality of this faucet."
4,VERY EASY,I installed this faucet myself. I have no plumbing experience it was Very easy once I took the old faucet off. It looks nice and I am very happy with this faucet.
1,Poorly Designed,"Sadly these styluses seem perfect until after you have used them for a while. After a few days worth of use, the top of the stylus will come off (the part covering the ink pen). This plastic top usually goes flying across the room and ends up lost. I went through a 3 pack in 2 days.The worst part is that a simple fix of a screw on pen cap would easily fix the problem. What a waste."
3,"Convenient, But","I thought that I would like this replacement stylus which incorporates a pen. However, in use I found a slightly annoying flaw. Occasionally, when attempting to remove the stylus from the holder, I come away with only the top, while the rest of the stylus stays in the phone and can only be removed using tweezers or pliers. Theoretically, it is great to have both a stylus and a pen, and it works fine when I can get it out, but it's annoying when the pen gets stuck in the phone. I recommend using a basic replacement stylus instead of this product."
1,a miss,"The stylus did not properly fit the space that is allocated for it. It would slide out without putting a piece of tape on it. Poor design, not worth returning- but I am unhappy...."
5,Step by Step,"One thing you can say about Eleanor Burns is that she tells you everything step by step. She always has very complete directions and this quilt is no exception. I like the idea of something more than just a log cabin quilt. I am excited to make this quilt with the added idea of the stars. Think it will look so antique. It is not a fast quilt because stars always take a lot of step to piece a star and there will be a lot of stars in this but it is a basic design that you can make. Eleanor's company is called ""Quilt in a Day"" - it does not mean the quilt can be made in a day."
4,"good book, but NOT a quick to make quilt","This book has excellent directions, and I found that the quilt went together very easily and accurately, but NOT very quickly. I did a double/queen and it took me about 30 hours just to piece the top. The quilting of course took much longer. So, do not buy this if you really think it's a fast quilt to put together. Also, the piecing methods for the stars are very easy, but they waste a LOT of fabric. Next time, I'll just piece them the old fashioned way."
4,Star Log Cabin Quilt in a Day by Eleanor Burns,Directions were very thorough as were pictures showing each step of making this quilt. Sizes given were from wallhanging to king. The quilt I made won first place in a local quilt show.
3,A Very Secure Keychain,"Definitely don't plan on using this to lock anything substantial. It's thinnest point is about 1/8 of an inch. As other people have sad, it's easy to bend and since it folds inward, there's very little you can lock up.However, if you're like me and use carabiners all the time as keychains, this is great because it locks and your keys don't fall off.What's also nice is that if you do find yourself needing to lock something (not amazingly securely), this will do the job."
2,Hard to fit most locker,"I used this lock for 3 years before it quit working. Granted, it wasn't expensive and the combination was easy. However, when the lock quit working it locked in place- with my towel and work clothes in the locker.I twisted it off with one hand in under 30seconds ??!?!!"
3,Great Until it Breaks,"Half the time at the gym I don't even lock my stuff up, I just shove it in an empty locker and hope nobody opens it. But then I started using this thing. And it worked great for awhile. It's smaller and faster to use than a regular padlock, and it served me well until one day I dropped it 4 feet onto the floor and it cracked neatly in half. Well, I liked its convenience so I'm buying another one, but I don't expect it to last forever."
2,OK when it fits (but it usually doesn't),"The fatal flaw of this lock is that it opens inward, and only about 1/4"". If you try to use it in random places, like hostel lockers, it usually doesn't fit, since a normal lock doesn't have that limit. You're much better served by a standard Master combination lock."
2,Limited Use Lock,"Have owned this lock over a year and used it (or tried to) on multiple style lockers at schools and gyms. Generally, it will not fit most lockers because of the short opening width. Solving this reveals its most serious flaw - the hook on it is very easy to bend, making it ineffective for real security. Unless you need a lock just for show, skip this one and use a padlock or spheero style lock. There are good ones for only a few dollars more that you can set the combination, and they provide much better security."
4,One of the best Avenger books,"Now here's a book worth buying! This book was interesting, witty, and insightful. The pictures are delightful. It is a wonderful read, allowing plenty of insight to the show as well as Patrick Macnee himself."
1,not that good,When i first got the book along with the other books that i ordered... I was personally hoping for a book nothing more as was expected....the book ended up being a coloring book with a few activities like mazes. I would reccomend it to any child that loves to color but not for someone purily wanting to read a book to a child going to sleep.
5,Buy this book. Trust me.,"Finally, a comprehensive book on the art of character animation that goes beyond ""push this button, now push that one"".With a background of traditional animation (like Brad ""incredibles"" Byrd and John ""Pixar Honcho"" Lassiter), Timothy Albee focuses on how to use the tools within Lightwave to create characters with personality. And it's the character's personality that makes an animation memorable. This is the best book on Character animtion using lightwave that I've seen, and a great resource for learning about the art of animation regardless of your tools of choice."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"Maybe it was me but this attachment caused more problems than simply cutting the concrete. The Groover attachement with the weight of the bull float on it caused stones push upward on the sides. The concrete was left with a messy groove that was too wide and rough. I refloated the groove to smooth it out somewhat.I ended up cutting the gooves rather than using this attachment. I can only guess that the weight of the float caused it (the groover) to dig into the concrete. Controlling the bull float was more difficult too.Maybe it was me, but I prefer cutting the grooves or doing it by hand."
2,A Sad Showing,"I've been a BOC fan since the mid-70's, and I rocked live to their ""Black and Blue"" tour with Black Sabbath. That was an awesome show!""A Long Day's Night"" is a sad, sad picture of what the band's become. Bloom's vocals are often off-key, the songs lack punch. The guitar work still rocks, but how many guitar solos can you really listen to once you're in your 40's?I bought this DVD hoping to relive a fantastic live concert experience of many years ago. What I got was a long, dull night in which this band, once among the greatest of rockers, actually put me to sleep."
5,Buck makes 'em all his beotch!!!,"Page shot his arms out, Eddie got cancer, and softie Clapton never was the man. Buck does it right! I followed BOC and was there during the Soft White Underbelly daze...they've never been better than this! You'll have a hard time putting this DVD away."
2,"GREAT BAND, LOUSY RECORDING","FIRST OF ALL, I THINK BOC IS A GREAT BAND. HAVING SEEN THEM LIVE, I KNOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN SOUND. I'M SORRY, BUT HOW DO YOU TAPE A WHOLE CONCERT, WITH MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE VOCAL MIX, SIT DOWN AFTERWARDS AND LISTEN TO IT, AND THEN RELEASE IT ANYWAYS. ERIC BLOOMS VOCAL MIKE WAS TOO HOT, MAKING HIM SOUND OUT OF TUNE IN SOME PLACES. BUCK'S VOCALS SOUNDED GOOD, IF ONLY YOU COULD HEAR HIM. WITH TODAY'S RECORDING TECHNOLOGY, WAS THERE NOTHING THEY COULD DO? THE SAD PART IS, IS THAT THE PLAYING IS DAMN GOOD. IF YOU'RE A BOC FAN, YOU'LL BE [UPSET]."
3,GREAT BAND !! SHODDY SOUND PRODUCTION !!,"If I was the manager of Blue Oyster Cult, I would fire the sound man responsible for the shoddy sound quality of this dvd. It's either BOC's sound man or the video production's soundman... Eric Bloom's microphone is way too high and Buck Dharma's microphone is completely turned off during some of his best songs, including ""Don't Fear the Reapter"" and ""Dance on Stilts"" and ""Harvest Moon."" If it wasn't for the fact I was a HUGE Blue Oyster Cult fan, I would not recommend this dvd because of the horrible sound. And whoever they have operating the video camera on the jib arm that scans the stage and audience should practice a bit more...Yes, I'm probably being a bit picky, but people (fans) who expect quality, deserve better than this. If you really want to get the best performance, see the group live."
3,Too Smelly,"Everything about the cream was great, however it was so heavily perfumed I have been unable to use it consistantly."
4,Fatty cream,Not much success and I have to admit that more expensive products are doing a better job on my skin.
4,Fishman AG-125,The product was damaged due to original packaging from Fishman. I contacted them with the problem and they gladly shipped me a replacement. Thanks Fishman the replacement works great.
1,Secular-Progressive Spin on Christianity,I could not bring myself to believe this was a serious search for the truth based on my review of a few topics with which I had considerable familiarity. The material presented in this book appears to be a secular-progressive attempt to cast doubt about Christ and Christianity under the guise of a serious work. It seems to be most selective in regard to the information presented and should not be used by any serious student in search of the truth. There are just too many good books on this subject to waste your time reading this one!
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried this product and it didn't help me sleep, but then again I'm under alot of stress at this time. My friend tried it ad well and had good success."
2,Worked for a week,"Seemed to calm for about a week at 2 caps, then needed 3 the next week, then 4. Gave up on these."
3,Whole herb over extracts,"This passionflower extract did not do much for me. I have since gotten a bottle of whole passionflower herb, which was much more effective.Sometimes an extract contains only a portion of the wanted parts of a plant. Passionflower is not the only extract I have tried that was not nearly as good as the whole herb product."
5,Ivan Vasilievich - Back to thw Future,It has been for years the favorit movie of all my family already the third generation just LOVE it!Thank you to Amazon!!!
3,Not useful unless you have all the sheet music,"The tracks are good and this set contains a wide variety of songs from a ton of shows BUT without the sheet music for every song, don't expect to be able to learn them. A few are self explanatory (like when to come in etc.) but most would require at least a count of the bars before you sing and musical interludes etc. It's all tracks and nothing else. Not for anyone unfamiliar with the songs."
3,Too big,"This pan is actually much larger than stated in product info. It is 12.5x8.5 inches, which will not fit in the toaster oven that I ordered it to use in. It looks like a well made pan, but the size makes it unusable for me."
1,size is wrong,"The product descriptions says approx 10 1/2, it's over 12 1/2 inches. It wont fit in the mini oven I have."
3,Wrong description on size,There are two different size description on product description and I wasn't careful enough to see size listed at bottom.This pan was slightly bigger than my toaster oven so I tried to return it.Amazon didn't want the product back but refunded the money.That was nice of them but I really don't need this pan so I ordered new one.
2,"""Texas"" sized?","If you call it a ""Texas Muffin"" tin, you'd expect it to make ""Texas-sized"" muffins! I thought this was a jumbo muffin tin, but it just makes regular sized muffins. If that's what you're looking for, I'm sure it's a solid buy: mine will be going back."
1,What does non-stick mean to you?,"My husband knew I was looking for a non-stick muffin pan and kindly bought this for me. I happily made a batch of muffins and put the batter directly into the pan, thinking how great it was going to be to skip the step where I butter the pan. The muffins stuck badly to the pan. They stuck to this pan worse than they would have stuck to the fine old Ekco muffin pan I've been using for years. I have just read through the other reviews of this item and was amazed to see people are highly impressed by a pan that they must first grease before putting in the muffin batter. Folks, this has been true of all muffin pans for as long as I've been alive, and that's a very long time. Other than that aspect, this pan is almost as good as my old Ekco pan."
3,Very Basic--Not Much Detail,"If you're looking for anything but the most basic information about electric flight, this isn't your book. I had hoped that, since it has an October, 2005 copyright, it would offer in-depth information regarding outrunner motors, Li-Poly options, brushless ESCs, etc. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.The section on batteries is woefully deficient, especially when he doesn't go into any depth on ""C"" charging protocols, peak sensing chargers and conditioners, etc. He covers these so lightly that, if I hadn't done reading elsewhere, I'd have been lost. Lots of excellent photos and other eye candy but not much real substance for someone wanting to make decisions.There's much better information (free) at masportaviator.com and electric-only sites like ezonemag.com"
2,Just another gimmick product,"This would be a godsend if it worked as advertised. It sucks up next to nothing, the trashcompartment is hard to get out and harder to get in and its almost impossible to find the refills."
3,Prog-Rock Brightman style; for true fans only,"My wife is a true SB fan; I enjoy her music but not in an ""SB-can-do-no-wrong"" mode. ""Fly"" is Sarah Brightman's take on Progressive Rock. Unlike her earlier pop album ""Dive,"" on which the music is merely an accompaniment to her voice, the music on ""Fly"" is complex and overproduced. Many times the music threatens to overpower her voice, and prog-rock guitar solos, overdubbed backing vocals and synthesizer blends are not why we buy Sarah Brightman albums. ""Time to Say Goodbye"" is a bizarre anomaly on this album--its style is completely different from every other track."
5,An Intense Album That Makes You Feel Like Your Flying.,"Although the first song in this album ""Time To Say Goodbye"" seems out of place, the other tracks have the feeling of soaring through air. (""Dive"" made me feel like submerging under the sea). My favorite tracks were ""Heaven Is Here"", ""Ghost In The Machine"", and ""How Can Heaven Love Me""--but all the tracks stand on their own."
1,bad shipping,purchased the item august 26 and they didnt ship it until the 31. It shouldnt take 5 days to package my item and get it out the door.
1,bad luck or service?,I've sent you an email that I did not receive the purchased items!!!!!!!!!!Please answer my email and complaint!
2,"Cheap, both quality and price","These were amazingly cheap, so my expecations were not incredibly high for these, and that's about how it turned out. the first time my son used them, 1/3 to 1/2 of them broke upon impact of the foam block target. On the following rounds of shots, a lower percentage broke. Maybe we are through the ""weak"" ones. I recommend you buy 2x or 3x as many as you want; for the price you could probably do this."
4,Great Buy,"Great product for a great price. All work fantastically, though have a tendency to break when shot at say a piece of wood? The tips and ends are only glued in, instead of having threads that can be replaced or repaired. Perfect for a cheap, disposable practice bolt! I will definitely be buying more in the near future."
4,I don't see any sex.,"First of all, what is wrong with this toy. That is a 12 year old girl in the comercial. 12 is old enough to date. And where did you get the idea that they're sneaking out? God, people. These are just inosent dolls. The only problem is they come with only one outfit each. i don't have one though. But i might get one from santa."
5,Xodite zhrat' pozhalusta!,"As a non-Russian immigrant from the USSR, I have largely lost (unfortunately) appreciation for Soviet movies - nowadays I'll be lucky to put together two words in Russian, which has been almost entirely replaced by English.One movie that I still watch, however, and still find gut-bustingly funny is Dzhentlemeny Udachi (this film). The acting, the humor and the Soviet propaganda just make it so delightfully hilarious (and to some extent camp), that I can't see myself not watching this film at least once a year.There are lots of other Soviet comedies that are funny, but most of them have lost their appeal. That's not something I can say about this film which has the best replay value of all Soviet comedies - at least for me."
4,Must get but could have been better,"This DVD is worth getting for early 67 performance of The End in Toronto (even if the Oedipal section was not performed) and the complete Copenhagen TV broadcast. The PBS interview and performances are also complete - it is great to see and hear Tell All The People live along with Back Door Man (the rest of the PBS video renditions have appeared before). BUT what source material did they use to make the PBS segment of the DVD? The picture quality is really poor; there are drop-outs, white lines, and the color is washed out. This wouldn't be so frustrating but portions of the segment appear on the Doors Soft Parade laser disc and The Doors Collection DVD set in really fine quality without all the video noise. The recent interview segments with the surviving Doors (do they look OLD!) are interesting but the video is jumpy and the sound sometimes out-of-synch. Poor DVD rendering. In the end I still recommend it for anyone who has a passion for the Doors."
4,Good Value,I purchased this for $1.99 here on Amazon.It is great for making cakes. I very good value it is. Does the job.
5,Worked GREAT,"I couldn't find an 8"" cake pan anywhere and these worked wonderfully! Nothing stuck, the cakes came out amazing and they were super easy to clean! I'd recommend these to everyone who needs a higher cake than a 9"" cake pan provides."
4,The wife wanted it and loves it,My wife wanted this cake pan. So we bought it. She has not been disappointed. There is a little *'s with the nonstick. Just be safe and spray Pam.
1,"not 8""","i was happy to find an 8"" pan, especially with handles. i used my 8"" round parchment liners, and was surprised when they did not fit because they were too large. i figured they were cut wrong, so i trimmed them. then i made up my chocolate buttermilk cake batter and put the pans in the oven.and waited for them to finish baking. and waited, and waited! i had to keep adding time, since the middle was still not done.needless to say, by the time the cake was complete, the edges were ""well done"". so, i decided to measure the bottom diameter of the pan.surprise! my pan is 7 and 1/2 inches! so gals, measure your pans."
3,Not his best work but a good read all the same.,"A good book, especialy in election year. Good plot development, good characters but somehow Bury's writing style doesn't inspire like he (using other names) did with Cryptomincon or Snow Crash. IMHO the style is a little like 'Zodiak - the Eco thriller' but I just didn't find it as riveting."
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,"What a boring book. This book has a very interesting premise, but it has too many charecters, frankly. A big letdown. The interesting idea does not drive the novel, but seems rather like an afterthought. The many, many charecters have no depth and do not develop (excluding the main charecter - I hesitate to say main charecter, because he appears in less than half of this novel). Avoid."
4,typical Stephenson,"This novel is typical Stephenson. All of the characters, although not very deep, are very well fleshed out. The technological aspect is very relavent for the current times of instant internet polls. This was a very quick read which you do not get the pleasure of experiencing in a lot of his novels. Like most of his works, Stephenson researches what he is talking about and you actually learn something should you choose to do so. It has the typical Stephenson finish of ending at the climax.You will enjoy this book if you like Stephenson, Science Fiction, Political Fiction, CSI or any of those other shoes, or if you just want a good read. This book is appropriate for all ages but a healthy dose of cynicism may be needed for enjoyment."
2,kind of terrible,I cannot beleive how well received this movie was! Sean Penn's character was rediculous. I beleive Ed Harris was poorly cast for this movie- I didn't buy his character for a minute. This movie had so much potential but fell short. The ending - again rediculous. The writers had much they could have done with this movie - espeically considering how long it was. I think they took a second look at it realized it didn't have to suck -and came up with The Departed.
2,DVD that doesnt play on DVD player,Ordered DVD. Was wrong format to play on DVD player. Who would know DVD wouldnt play on DVD player. Apparently could only watch on computer. Very Disappointed. (State of Grace) Sean Penn
3,"not the best of all time, but acting makes up for it","British actor Gary Oldman gies the performance of his career in the violent, thrilling tale of a hood-turned-cop (Penn) sent on a police mission to infiltrate the brutal and unpredictable Irish-American criminal organization run by Frankie Flannery (Ed Harris), and his younger,wild alcoholic junkie brother Jackie Flannery (the drunken Oldman), in West NYC's Hell's Kitchen. Rent this movie, drink a Guiness and eat a hot potato toppled with butter, and say ''F!ck the Sicilians''!!"
4,Great movie,"This is a great mob/gangster movie with a great cast. Surprisingly, it has been largely overlooked. In fact, I had never even heard of it until I saw it on IFC in 2008, 18 years after it was released!This movie also has a lot of similarities with The Departed. I am surprised few have noted the similarities:*The Irish Mob.*The demented Irish Mob ""Godfather,"" played by Ed Harris.*The undercover cop who was affiliated with the gang, left, became an officer, went undercover, and then returned.*The love interest with a person close to the undercover officer's friend."
3,Complete Guide to Carb Counting,I was expecting a book full of foods and their carbs. There was a lot of written stuff. I just wanted a carb counter.
5,Great help,"This is a great book, i am a newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic and found the book to be most helpful in learning about Carb Counting."
3,FUNNY FIGHTING FEMALE FATTIES,"Love'em or hate 'em, idiosyncratic films that dabble with subversive notions and stories of fringe people make some viewers uncomfortable. You either get it or not. For those who do, there are rewards.SECRET SOCIETY (First Run Features) is about Daisy (Charlotte Brittain), plump factory-worker wife adored by her unemployed husband. At work, Daisy's chubby lady boss grants favors to rotund female coworkers. One thing leads to another, soon Daisy's in a secret society of women sumo wrestlers. Suddenly, she must choose between keeping things as they are or risk becoming something exceptional. I was amazed and amused."
1,Junk with discharged batter,"Bought this two days ago. Worked fine for two days. Now the battery is discharged and APC tech support is telling me ""Tough Luck... I must not have plugged it in and left it turned off for long enough. Its my problem not theirs"" The product is defective and the tech support is ineffective. This was VERY disappointing. I have had many good APC products and our company resells their products. I guess I'm going to have to start a re-evaluation of what we are selling & recommending to our clients."
3,Not for everyone!,"While this book is easy to read, and covers many of the basics, and does recommend many easy to grow orchids, it is much too limited in application. If you are an orchid beginner and an apartment dweller in New York City, this is the perfect book for you and most everything applies to your situation. If are an orchid beginner that lives in a house in a warmer climate, some of the advice is just plain poor.A comfortable, pretty book, but not for everyone."
2,very old fashioned cinematic techniques,"An old fashioned comedy, not sure if deliberate or just primitive. Very antiquated cinematic techniques. The amusement seemed unintentional and awkward, vaudeville-like. Poor scene transitions"
1,Dead cell,I bought this not really knowing who Soft Cell was so. . . I guess it's just not for me. Sound and video are a good quality.
2,Apple Store,"The advice to only buy the book if you do not have access to an Apple store is inaccurateHave you ever tried to get tech help at a crowded Apple store.Most "" Geniuses "" send you to Apple online support which can be a nightmareAs a Mac customer that has been trying to extend his network so his Apple TV will work and can use his Ipad in other rooms in his home I recommend this book."
4,good musice but c.d. doesn't play in all players!!,"The music on the c.d. was good, however, due to the copyright feature on the c.d., it does not play in all c.d. players. After noticing a clicking, popping, scratching sound, I looked on the booklet and it warned that the c.d. might not be playable in some automobile stereos. If you're like me, I listen to the majority of my music in my vehicle. Just be warned, it doesn't play all that well. If you can tune out the annoying sounds it makes then you can kind of enjoy it in you vehicle. I have no trouble playing it in my 2002 vehicle. But it doesn't work too well in my 2005. But, I had I payed attention to this little detail before I purchased it, I wouldn't have bought it. I prefer to be able to listen to my c.d.'s when and where I want. Other than that little problem, Joss Stone is a very good artist."
1,"I love soul/RandB, but this is terrible.","There either is something wrong with my ears or her voice just stinks. It got on my nerves the first time I heard her sing. Her imitation of a black woman's voice is poorly done and my ears will bleed if I ever have to listen to her again. I do agree that she sounds manufactured (Like Ashlee Simpson, Ryan Cabrera, etc.) because she really does n ot have any talent in her singing whatsoever."
3,Looking for Soul? Don't look here.,"I fell in love with her voice the minute I heard her. The depth, the quality, the sheer magnitude of her talent just overwhelmed me. I loved her first CD and was looking forward to the second. When I pushed it into the CD player and heard that first song, I had to look at the CD itself to be sure I had Joss Stone. What I heard was not the blues as I expected which is probably my own fault. I shouldn't have expected another great blues album. Singers need to diversify. Although it was still her great voice, the music was so overproduced it just blanched each song. Too many back up singers, WAY TOO MANY BACK UP SINGERS! She doesn't NEED back up singers. The songs were pop-music, like Beyonce and JLo who are wonderful in their genre. Joss Stone was, however, the next great female blues singer of our time. Please, producers, put her voice back where it belongs... with the great singers of the blues."
3,not a bad first effort,Joss Stone has quite a soulful voice for one so young. It is obvious that the production budget was not very high for this cd. Hopefully her next one can have more varied and sophisticated orchestrations. Also this production would have profited by some editing. Some of the vamps go on to the point of annoyance.
1,my rate relates to the quality of the product,"I received DVD which is partly BLACK AND WHITE, partly IN COLORPartly has a SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION, partly have SUBTITLES.I payed $15.00 to InternationalCDS company. To return it will cost me $11.00.I feel very disappointed. I didn't purchased this DVD from some street vendor. I trusted Amazon.com.Please help me to get back the money I payed. I will be more than glad to send you the DVD.Paulina Roth"
2,Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!,"I am very disappointed because the movie parts has been cut out specially in the 1st part, you even can tell where has been cut out by the sound,discoloration and it doesn't making any since where the scene stops and new beginns. If i would of knowing that i would of never purchased it in the first place"
2,not as good as the original black out tape!!!,"The original would last for years, but the new tape that replaced it isn't as strong as an adhesive and doesn't stay on as well. Luckily I still have some of the old tape that I'll only use for the exterior of the car and only use the new version on the interior. Hopefully the makers of this tape will see this review and improve their tape once again!"
4,Good album for easy-listening fans,"Sarah Brightman is a sort of Nana Mouskouri but even more commercially targeted - and more classical. Not all people love her voice, but I was really enchanted to hear her sing tracks like ""No one like you"" and ""Tu quieres volver"". She might try adding a little more emotional depth (i.e., be less middle-of-the-road), but this album is absolutely worth listening to."
5,The BEST CD I have EVER heard!!,"This is one AWESOME music CD!! Sarah Brightman has the best, most beautiful voice I have ever heard. This CD is a rare gem. There aren't ANY songs on this CD that aren't beautiful, and some will REALLY take your breath away (just watch out of you're driving and listening to these songs...) This CD makes me wonder what the heck I was thinking when I bought all those other CDs by other artists. Buy this CD if it's the last thing you do. If you like artists like Celine Dion and Enya, then you'll be FLOORED by the musical ability of Sarah Brightman. She's the best."
2,"Sarah is losing the classical ""edge"" to her voice!","The ""Italianische"" arrangements are soothing, but very monotonous. Her high registers seem strained and less clear than previous recordings, and the album as a whole was very unispired. Sarah fans are better off sticking to the ""Requiem"", ""Dive"", ""Fly"", and broadway compilations... She is getting older, NOT better."
4,Sasha is good but has a few mistakes...,"Well, I bought the Tokyo a Go-GoSahsa because I love Sasha! I have five Sasha dolls! well, anyway...I opened it to find that the hairwas gorgeous! it was streaked and I think it was the only Tokyo doll with crimped hair.Well: it did have a few problems: the second pair of pants, (the rainbow skirt with jeans w/pink piping) wouldn't fit on her! I am twelve and tried cutting them to fit but they wouldn't pull on any higher than her thighs. I put it aside thinking, ""Oh, well, I still have another outfit!""The beautiful Pink-and-purple spotted shirt withfur....now that was something. But after about3 days of light, light, play... there was a hole in the arm! Now I am a SERIOUS doll person and was amazed, yet still in a respectible way, that the Tokyo line was this delicate. I also have Tokyo Cloe and think that one is much more durable. I would suggest that over this."
1,I'm tired of game reviews that don't say it like it is for some od reson,I had perchesed this game from Amazon like many other games but was anger at them doto they sent me two of the same game and I only wanted one to buy one so I paid for two how stupied.. but i like there deals and over looked this even though they did it one other time agian with a called the suffering... This game had excllent characters and they look very cool but the game length was like playing a demo verison maybe a little longer. I would suggest a price of three to four dollers. Only this much because it had some good game play but not much...
5,CHUCK NASH HAS WHAT IT TAKES,"THIS CD IS OVERALL FANTASTIC,THE MUSIC AND LYRICS I TRULY LOVE THEM,I THINK THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THERE ARE ONLY SIX (6) TRACKS ON THIS CD,I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING GOOD THINGS FROM CHUCK NASH IN THE FUTURE."
1,I hope nothing goes wrong with the TV,I had this TV for about 9 months when a buzzing noise started and the TV picture started blacking out. The TV was still covered under the 1 yr manufacturer's warranty. I had a Philips authorized service center look at the TV and deem that the power supply needed to be replaced. It has been a nightmare getting the TV back. My TV is basically being held hostage by Philips. The part is on back order with no end date in sight. They are the absolute worst Customer Service group that you could ever encounter. They give you nothing but canned non answers and are totally uncooperative and not helpful. I am still without my TV and it has been over 5 weeks now. Philips is one of the worst companies that I have ever dealt with and I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase this or any other TV from them.I am giving this TV 1 star because zero stars is not a selection.
3,The final season was Okay,"Okay, let's clarify this. Yes Johnny Depp is on the cover and only appears in the one episode. BUT... the box does say that the Blackout episode (a very good one) is his last appearance. Now this episode was filmed for season 4 but for some reason it was not shown until the syndicated season 5. So it does belong on this set. Johnny Depp was so unhappy on the show by this time that he mumbled his lines, wore a patch over his nose and obscured his face with his hair. The rest of the episodes are hit or miss, with characters just disappearing, but it is nice to complete the set even without much resolution."
2,Ehhh.,"Ehhh. It was okay. I gleamed one bit of insight from it. Thankfully, it was a short read so don't feel I wasted too much time."
5,What do you expect from God?,"Love is the life force we all live by, and this book too makes that clear to us - as you would expect when it is a book Neale wrote."
3,Bugs&dust,"Greetings, I have captured one bug but dust bunnies are another story.A multitasking tool. Practice will remedy my lack of ability. If it quites I will purchase another, and give it one more star."
1,bugbuster insect vac,very low on power hardly holds the bugs in if you can catch them. poor product all the way around.
2,I find it not so sucky,"The other reviewer gave it a great review, but perhaps I got a bad one, because it doesn't suck. I find I have to pretty much scoop the bugs up with it, unless they are something light with big wings (like a moth), in which case it will suck them up. I have seen ones that work well, but I don't know if the brand and/or make are different with those one. However, while some maybe great, the one I got wasn't, too bad. I hope that Dyson company makes on soon and they use the power at their disposal to make a super powerful one that can suck up a nest of killer bees, or a fly across the room, but until then I live in fear of both. Sam"
1,Takes luck and patience to capture bug,"If you have a lot of time and patience to wait for the bug to crawl into the tube then this product is for you. It has absolutely no suction. I couldn't even get a small moth to go into the tube. Basically, you could place a glass or jar over the insect, wait for it to crawl or fly in, slide a piece of cardboard over the top and carry the insect outside and release it - and this method is free! Don't waste your money on this product!!!"
3,"Hmmm, wish I could give it 5","I wish I could give it five,it does keep the bugs alive,but is doesn't suck really very strongso you have to really just push the bugs alone,into the front of the container,yes I could write this review plainer,but I want to have funand my BugBuster enthusiasm is undone,because it only works so-so,now I am going to go"
1,Not worth the time,"I bought two of these units, one did not work. The one that did work the battery keeps falling out and the top will not stay on. So once you catch the bugs the top falls and they are free again. Pay a little more and get a better device."
1,No power,I own a similar product and it works perfectly. I bought one as a Christmas gift in October. After the gift was opened and it didn't work I called the vendor and was told that it was more than 2 months since the purchase (bad idea to do early shopping). Purchased from this vendor to replace non-working gift. This gift worked the same as first gift. Could not suck up a bug or even a piece of paper.
2,Not enough suction to be very useful.,The basic idea is great. A device that sucks up bugs so that you don't have to get too close and you don't have to make a mess squashing them. This device does work for very small spiders or insects but just doesn't have the suction power for larger ones.
3,Not As Clear To Read....,"....as the Temprite disposable poultry sensors. With the disposable ones you can clearly see the color change from black to red. I have only used the poultry thermometer from this set so far, but since the back of the package is in black and white, I did not know if it was to change to red, blue, purple or what. I like the fact that you have 5 different thermometers in the set for all your cooking and baking needs. I love how easy they are to clean (no dishwasher for these!!)not like the dial thermometers that always get water inside the dial. I will be trying to get in touch with the company (Taylor) to find out exactly what color each are supposed to change to. Overall though, for the price, these thermometers are worth it."
2,okay for the price,"I bought this lightly used for $35, and even with that I have some buyer's remorse. The battery would not hold a charge, and some online reviews suggested this is a common problem. Unfortunately it didn't come with a car adapter, so I had to buy one from the company for $23. The disc cover is pretty flimsy and has already broken, although it does still play. If your DVD's are in less than pristine condition, you will likely run into playback problems. That said, the playback quality is actually pretty decent, so if you're looking for a lower=priced player, it's okay."
3,Her Royal Husband (Crown and Glory),"Story started good, with Prince being kidnapped and saved. Then there's romance that was good but it seem like too many things going on in such a short story. I liked that Prince loved people and loved by his people in return, how he was broght up to be future king and them wham.... He was just being used by Queen to save real son from unknown enemy. I will not recommend this Crown and Glory series. i mistakenly bought 4 of series just to see who real son is and what a disappointment."
4,Romance about holding on to what's really dear.,"Don't be thrown by the opening adventure writing, this is a romance suspense novel. A man escapes captivity partly by focusig on the people whose lives have touched in the most. Number one, not of his royal crowd, is Jordan an American model. They meet up where he finds out that Jordan has been raising their daughter...tense and tease in just the right places."
2,Emergenetics,"Its great on theory, its demonstrate we as individual are a complex being and our profile is seasonal. The main reason I bought the book is to find out about my profile and disappointed not finding any starter or basic self help tool kit in the book other than visiting the book website and an additional payment of $100 is needed before result can be delivered to me."
3,Not so good on Kindle,"The book is well organized and written, and the material is interesting. I would give it more stars if I had bought the paperback copy. Unfortunately, the illustrations do NOT translate well on the Kindle. The print is way too small on a Kindle Touch, even when the drawing is enlarged as large as the Kindle allows. If you are visual & like drawings, buy the paperback version until someone figures out how to make the drawings more accessible to Kindle readers."
1,A bunch of profiles of people I don't know.,"There are a few interesting chapters, but there are too many profiles of uninteresting people. This book could be condensed into an interesting article. As a book, it is a waste of time."
4,"A basic, helpful beginning.","What a great resource this book is! As a teacher for young children, this book provided a great background of the craft, easy instructions and even a glossary of terms. For someone who has never experimented with the natural dyeing process, the book was a great place to begin. The wondeful colored pictures were also a delightful reference especially for showing children when presenting a lesson."
4,cool book,cool book. I was expecting a bit more info but still did give quite a bit of insight. I would buy it again
5,Amazing grain,"This was my first time to try Salba grain and it truely lives up to the advertising. It's easy to use in the ground form by adding it to anything you are cooking. I've tried it in oatmeal, biscuits, tuna & noodles, and scones. It's a thickener so you may need to add more liquid to a recipe. I've found my energy is more consistant through out the day and I don't get hungry as quickly. It has a very mild flavor so thus can be used with other food easily."
3,Great song but remixes are mediocre,"So I have 2 versions of this CD: The single and the maxi-single. On the single, it's just the song and another one that's on the album.This review will be on the maxi-single. The original song is great. The remixes are mediocre. On the maxi-single, there are 10 tracks. The 9 remixes all sound the same and they dance version doesn't really keep the integrity of the original. They are so many other remixers out there that can mix a song really well. They did not collaborate on this single."
3,Good attempt but a bit lacking,The images are great both for the historical nature and recreation of the originals and for coloring too. However there is very little in terms of explanations of what the images are and how they represent Egyptian history. The focus is really on tomb images and there needs to be a discussion of the concerns this should create. Once again the illustrations and the text is uncredited.
1,Total rip off,Great for people that don't think there is a prophecy.A total waste of time and money...not one interestingsubject was brought up...save the earth...that's a prophecy???
5,A documentary for all,"This documentary is for anyone curious about the 2012 Mayan prophecy, from those who know it best...The Mayan elders of today! Beautifully done, this film is a 'definite' among interested and intelligent folks."
5,Real characters that develop,"Many anime series offer up stock characters who remain unchanged episode after epidsode. In addition to the many other outstanding features mentioned by other reviewers, I was struck by the way the various characters developed and grew throughout the series. We see Okabe break out of his ""mad scientist"" persona and demonstrate deep feelings for other characters in the show. We see Kurusu, almost unwillingly, move beyond fending off Okabe as a jerk into feelings of respect and affection.This was definitely my favourite anime series of the last few years for character, plot and sheer unpredictability. Very highly recommended."
1,Why English Only?,"I love Japanese Voice actor, but this item's language is English only!!!I want to watch Steins;Gate, Japanese audio English Subtitles..."
2,low budget- its done at ballys fitness gym,"this video is ridiculous in the way its been made. she teaches a class at a bally's fitness gym and you can se other people in the background on stairmaster , ect. it's really stupid!, belly dancing is a fun way to excercise but this video spends most of its time on showing a mix of performances by the teacher and then she tries to sell you outfits at the end. most of the video is not actual class, waste of time, try another video!"
1,i wouldve given it a zero,This cd is so bad!!!!!! the combination of songs is terrible dont buy this cd there is nothing good on it at all.
4,Columbia Sportswear Men's Baracus Mid Trail Shoe,Good support for hikes. Due swelling of your feet during hikes recommend to get the half size larger. Will purchase the shoe again. Will buy half size bigger for better fit and comfort.
4,Simply Entertaining,"If you are a true Richard Boone fan, as I am, you can appreciate his usual loud expressionate voice is true to his character. This being his last film, made me curious about the film. He part is fairly brief, but convincing. Frank Converse as the Marine who goes inland to retrieve the sword, keeps the story going with lots of action, along with Sonny Shiba, is a good blend of characters. The big sailor, who stumbles into some sumu wrestlers, is hilarious. Keeping an eye on his nephew also adds to the story. I first saw this film back in 1980 on Cinemax, I have the VHS tape. I have watched it several times. What's a movie without a little malarkey. It's just fun to watch."
1,Cheeseball is being kind,"This hackneyed excuse for a samurai film is an example of great actors (excluding Frank Converse) needing work. The action sequences are laughable and if you may not have noticed, this is an Arthur Rankin/Jules Bass production, famed American cartoon producers, Frosty the Snowman being one of their most well-known works. Someone should have told them to ""thumpity, thump, thump"" back to Saturday morning fare. This one reeks about as much as the scene where the sailors refuse to take baths. Shogun may have been melodramatic, but there isn't an ounce of drama used here. Buy this one at your own risk. Only thing of value is the plastic box it came in. You can use it for another DVD and the DVD as a frisbee."
2,Easily chipped.....,"I was so excited to find these dishes and when I read the reviews here I just knew I'd love them. I ordered 4 sets of dinnerware and had intentions of ordering other pieces to match, but when I received my shipment, I had one plate broken (shipping problem) and a few of the pieces were chipped here and there. I knew with my large rough-and-tumble family that these dishes would never hold up at my house so sadly, I sent them all back. Amazon was very gracious and gave me free return shipping and promised to completely refund my money. THANKS AMAZON!I thought that Churchill China was made in England, but my dishes said ""Churchill China Made in China"". Perhaps that is why the quality was not up to snuff.Jody (who thought the dishes were beautiful, but beauty is as beauty does)"
2,dissapointment,We have owned these dishes for a year now and the glaze is wearing off and they smell funny as they have now become semi pourous. Destressed look is more like rejected look. very disapointed.
1,poor video editing again...,another poor video editing job. scene changes every second or two. very hard to watch. don't waste your money...it seems as if he has used the same video editor on all of his dvd's to date.
1,Does not work in Australia,"Hi There,This DVD does not work in Australia - I would like to either return or get a replacement - it is saying it is frmo another Zone so will not play.Thanks,Annike"
4,STEREO-TYPICAL SURF STORY,"Boy wins some C-Grade local surf comp. Wins ticket to Hawaii. Gets all his stuff knocked off by locals. Meets big time shaper. Gets taken in. Learns the real meaning of surfing. Enters big comp. Wins the girl. Sounds lame, but it's quite a good movie. Lots of name surfers play various parts, including Gerry Lopez, Laird Hamilton, Occy. Doesn't do much for the interaction between islanders and main-landers."
4,"What a ""Barny""!",Dude trippy to the max! Really this movie is fun. Lot's of old surfing ledgends. A must see for any true soul surfer. :)
4,Great Product / needs better instructions,"This is a heavy duty, well designed product. My small cat loves it. I love it. Now it doesn't have to bug me for food, and I can watch her weight. I have a couple of gripes.1. The manual refered me to a needed timer programming page, which didn't exist. I guess that part of the manual was missing. They had the full manual with all instructions on an included CDROM, but I wouldn't have known if I didn't look. And nothing tells you how to look.2. The top is difficult to remove and put back on, I guess this is good so your animal can't remove it."
3,mixed feelings,"It has been great to have a pet feeder. I have a cat that loves to eat and this has made it easier to keep her on a diet because she's stopped asking me for feed and just stares at the feeder istead :) With this one, I'm able to feed her an 1/8 of a cup at each meal so she gets to eat three times a day. The problem is I've only had it for 2 months and I had a problem with the timer when I tried to change the schedule and accidently set it off for about 10 min. This burned out the motor and it doesn't work anymore. That means the motor would have burned out in about 6 months even if it hadn't over run and the waranty is only for 3 months. After that, you have to pay for labor! I can't reccomend this product because of that, although from the reviews I see that this is a problem with all of the feeders."
4,They've fixed the dispenser-flap... it is more cat-resistant (04/07),I read several reviews of this product before I purchased it. It arrived today and I was pleased to see that the flap (through which food comes out) that appears in the photos has been changed and is now a long covered chute.It seems like this modification will help prevent the self-feeding other reveiwers have commented on.
2,Not for any cat with some smarts,"I thought this was the perfect solution to my irregular hours and thus cat feeding times, and when I first got it, it seemed to be perfect. However, it only took my cat a couple of days to figure out how to manipulate the lever that lets the food out so it would drop whenever she felt like a snack, or more. I tried different types of food, to no avail, and finally gave the feeder to my Mom who's cat isn't quite as astute or agile. Her cat is doing fine with it, and my cat is doing fine with a covered dish-type auto feeder that cost 1/3 as much!"
2,Not Worth The Money,For the first 4 months this feeder worked very well. Then it jammed and overfed our cats causing the motor to heat up and after that the product never worked correctly again. We had the timer piece replaced twice due to malfunction. Our auger dispenser broke due to the jam of the overfeed and the cats learned how to get their paws up in the auger and free feed themselves at all times. The bad news is that sadly this unit is not worth the money. The good news is that Ergo Customer Service worked with us to fully replace a whole new unit and two timer units.
5,A favorite in my collection,"This album easily stands out as the best Yes member solo album to date (and there have been MANY between the time of the release of this EP and now). Funky, memorable bass riffs, the esoteric beats of Bruford, the mesmorizing vocals of Yes' ""other"" vocalist and healthy dose of cool have kept this recording close to my CD player and near the top of my most played list on my iPod.Popping this disc into your CD player will change your day in the best possible way.Fish out of Water"
3,Ace of Bass,"Chris Squire may not have the greatest vocal style in the world (pace Steve Howe) but he proves here why he is the driving rhythm force in Yes. Just try and work out the time signatures! Although Safe does drag on a bit at least it is at the end. Lyrically, it is naive, but he is up against the singing milkman in Yes and not too prone to his verbal diarrhea. The highlights here are Hold out your Hand and Lucky Seven. Shame there's only one album when you consider all the spare time he's had over 35 years."
3,Not essential.,"This is not a great recording. The majority of the disc sounds like a well produced demo with strings added. Chris Squire's bass playing is always enjoyable, and Bill Bruford nicely compliments him as the other half of the rhythm section. Patrick Moraz is a little more subdued than usual, but also compliments things nicely. The problem lies in a lack of another solid musician to round things out and generate enough interest. With the exception of Lucky Seven, which is an outstanding cut with Mel Collins sitting in (the much needed fourth instrumentalist), it really does play like an overproduced demo. Chris Squire's voice is better suited for back up, than lead vocals. Only die-hard Yes fans, or better yet die-hard Squire fans need buy this one. Even though it's better than most of the other rubbish out there it's really not an essential addition to that prog-rock collection...Simon"
1,Laughable fiction,"Another laughable piece of anti-American fiction. This would be a great book if only any of the sources of information were verifiable. They're not, and this is fiction. I'd sooner believe that Clinton raped Juanita Broadderick.The wild imaginings of a lunatic author, at best."
3,Buster Brown socks,"The socks themselves are very nice and just like I wore as a kid. The problem for me is that they are so big as to be unwearable. I even washed one pair in hot water and dried them in the dryer,but they did not shrink one bit. This is wonderful for the rest of you people with normal feet. Mine are small and thin. So I had to return them at my expense! In hindsight, I should have donated them to the homeless shelter instead of returning for refund.Jan"
2,Not What I Was Accustomed To In Buster Brown Socks,"I had worn Buster Brown socks before, but these were too large in the size I wear and had purchased before. They were large enough they wadded up under my feet inside my shoes. I had always liked Buster Brown socks because they don't have seams you can feel, but the size issue will keep me from buying any more online."
2,buster brown socks,"these socks seemed okay at first, but stretch out while wearing them. Maybe I ordered one size too large? Also, do away with that ugly beige color in the 3 pack mixed colors."
3,Calphalon 12-slot knife bamboo block,Block seems solid and most knives fit. The main problem of the blockCalphalon Katana 13-Slot Bamboo Knife Blockis that the Calphalon knife sharpener is round and the hole for it in this block is square. It was poorly wrapped for shipping.
2,Relative flimsy and doesn't fit over cube walls,"This may fit over some office patrician, but won't fit over any cubicle wall on say a an office floor. Look for something more sturdy and and measure your wall before you purchase. This is definitely not heavy duty enough to hold my backpack with out the laptop in it."
1,A poor excuse for a DVD!,"Surely a better 35mm print exists than the one used to make this DVD! This one's full of splices and scratches. To add insult to injury, the film doesn't even follow the original novel, adding characters that weren't in the novel, deleting others and introducing studio-fabricated plot devices. RKO Radio Pictures lost $214,000 on this picture, so save your hard-earned cash and don't buy this DVD!"
4,Pretty hot Japanese bondage erotica,"This is a softcore Japanese bondage erotica film; it contains some scenes that are sure to repulse some viewers, some that others will find extremely erotic. Personally, I thought that there were some scenes that rated high on the orgasm scale... and others were a turn-off. But everyone's taste differs. Essentially the movie is a tour through the Tokyo sex underground. There's no more ""there"" there, if you get my drift... it's not art, it's softcore porn. There is a ""plot"" of sorts, but that's mainly just the director's fig leaf to cover the various sex scenes."
3,"Impressive film, but bad DVD production","The film could take place anywhere. While it is Japanese, nearly all the action is inside exchangeable hotel rooms, corridors, malls that could be in any country around the globe. Is this where society is going? Watch the film in your local repertory cinema first to see whether this is for you.The DVD production is not the best. While the DVD is not region-coded (which is good since you can't get in Europe), it is not the rated version that Amazon claims it is but an unrated one that is missing four minutes. You can't switch of the subtitles, which is very annoying, especially since there is an English dubbed track on the DVD - which doesn't match the subtitles.Get this, if you liked it in the cinema and build up a collection. Leave it otherwise."
2,Good movie... shame about the DVD,"The merits of the movie aside - and I consider it to be a very good film - this DVD is horrible. I understand that the care (normally) taken by the major studios cannot be lavished on small movies such as this, but there is really no excuse for how bad this film looks. The dark scenes, in particular, look just plain horrible.It's a shame, as this really is a good movie. If you're desparate to own this film, then go ahead. But if you're looking at this as an impulse buy I'd recommend leaving well alone."
2,A big letdown if you want something hot,"This Japanese movie revolves around a Tokyo callgirl who, not surprisingly, keeps running into weirdos. If you are looking for something to turn you on late at night, this may not do the trick, as it doesn't really have any good scenes -- I guess the beginning scene was probably the best, followed by the S&M one with the lady in heavy makeup. If you want a good storyline, you shouldn't even be looking at this video! I wouldn't say this one sucks, it's just not very satisfying, if you know what I mean."
3,A lock's a lock,"No problem with the lock itself, but the carrier bracket it comes with... well, it also comes with instructions to get it on your bike, but it's the vaguest set of instructions I've ever seen. Nothing is labeled, and it expects you to be able to tell by looking at the tiny blurred pictures on the tiny instruction sheet. This is really annoying."
1,Seriously... DON'T BUY THIS.,"I'm ridiculously dissatisfied with my purchase. The key very quickly started to get hard to use in the lock, and after about 2 months, it broke off inside the lock as I was trying to lock my bike. The fact that someone as weak and unathletic as me could break the key off by twisting it in the lock says something about how poorly it is made. I might send this back to master lock, but apparently it either takes them months to send back a new one or they don't do anything at all. Plus, I don't want to have to deal with another broken lock once the new one breaks."
4,QUALITY,"These would have received a five star rating had they not been so heavy. Other than that, they are a great quality buy."
5,excellent,"I bought these slippers for my daughter for Christmas, but I find myself slipping them on when she is not home. They are so comfortable and so soft...she loves them,as do I."
2,Shearling slippers,"Although these slippers are well constructed, the shearling material is rough, and scratchy feeling. I ended up returning them because of that."
5,So comfy!,"These are exactly what I wanted, a slipper that I could wear around the house and out to get the paper, etc. They have a sturdy heel on the bottom and are really soft and warm inside. I only regret that I didn't buy two pairs - I don't want to wear this one running errands because I'll get them dirty."
5,great slippers,"These slippers are worth every penny you pay for them. They are extremely soft, warm, and comfortable. They have a nice rubber sole with a little traction so you don't slide on the floor. They seem to run a little wide, which is great for me. They are very easy to slide into, no fighting to get your foot in."
2,Okay.,"A kind of ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" for the 21st Century, but not much is new. It's okay, but I wouldn't have purchased it if I would have had a chance to read more first. Some readers will find it more valuable than others. One of my friends loved it, but she's definately a late bloomer ... It's a primer of sorts, for older women. Kinda ho-hum for me."
1,Unscientific and insulting to female intelligence,"If you are an intelligent, discerning woman, this is not the book for you. If you believe that psychic pain and repressed memories are factors that contribute to current medical problems and that anecdotal evidence is on equal footing with empirical, reproducible results, then it is a book for you. I simply can't believe that this woman is an MD. She is irresponsible is giving primacy to ""the relationship"" with your ovaries and uterus over solid medical advice. My ""inner guidance"" tells me to put this book in the trash."
2,I'm not a fan of this book.........,"I'm not a fan of this book.........Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom (Revised Edition): Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing........I bought it Many years ago.....and ten again and each time I'm unimpressed....everyone loves this book....just not ,e!~"
2,"Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom","Got it for my sister as well,and she did not give me her opinion on it. I think women should read this book: Womens Bodies, Womens Wisdom""."
5,Very informative,Excellent information! The book walks you through a whole other perspective about your health and wellness. I was able to really relate to and understand some of the symptoms I had.
5,When my mom had a stroke...,"My mother had a stroke and the search began to help me understand more about it. It wasn't enough form me to know the mechanisms of a stroke; it always goes much deeper than that. After reading this book, I returned to school to start a career in nursing and I am now focusing on Women's Health Nurse Practitioner. I have learned a new respect for women both emotionally and physically. I am deeply grateful to Dr. Northrup for helping me mature and showing me a different way that more closely resonates with my core and for helping me develop mutually-respectful relationships with women. I hope to have the pleasure of meeting her someday."
4,Good but take some of it in stride.,"Christiane's book contains helpful information, but some of it may leave you feeling like you brought on your illness yourself, and that you can control your healing. While we do play a big role in our health, there are certain things that we can't take full responsibility for (like our DNA). We are not God. However, this book is very educational and can be used in combining a holistic with a traditional medical approach to healing. Mary Singer Wick, author of ""My Heart's Desire: A Journey Toward Finding Extravagant Love""."
5,Inspiration,"A few lines its all I have to say about this book, Like the words of a poet writer who wrote this particular lines "" A good teacher show the work, other teacher, Inspired"" and this book has inspired me to see my body with care, love, and hear what it is that is trying to tell me. I have Epilepsy, and Lupus, I don't remember what it is to live without pain, but now.. I feel so much better, I even have my aromatherapy home base business, and I help others, thanks to this Wonderful book that have change my life and the Author who wrote it. To All with Love, Venus Dominic-kilgore"
1,I was taken aback!,"Parts of this book were wonderful, however, I cannot recommend it for infertile women. I am not infertile because ""deep down I know my husband is the wrong man to get pregnant with."" I am infertile because I have a diagnosed medical condition which makes all my pregnancies ectopic. I believe in the mind/body connection, but this is pushing it. If women miscarry because they are ambiguous or unsure of motherhood, how does the author explain all the emotionally distraught, pregnant teenagers who have healthy babies? I don't think this book is a positive source of information for infertile women."
5,This book was much more than I expected!,"I had no idea when I bought this book just how much and how often I would use it, Yes! USE it! Any question I have about what's going on in my body or mind, I look up and am able to read more about. I've been able to speak with my doctor on a much more direct level given the information I've preread on the topics. She's also been very impressed with how much more I know and ask about as a result of this book. I'm buying a copy for my friend because she borrows it so often. For a woman, it's a must have."
5,Northrup's books are empowering,"I read her last edition to this book, and I'm looking forward to her new edition! Since I was 15, I was plagued with many ""female"" health issues that I thought were inevitable because of ""heredity."" After reading (and rereading) her books, I realized that those problems don't have to be my destiny. After working through some emotional issues, and seeing where the women in my family have come from in the past (low self worth, abusive upbringings, keeping painful feelings inside), and practicing more self care, my health hasn't been better! I'm 38, and still have my uterus.....which is old for the women in my family! I am now trying to use the information in tihs book, and well as in the ""Mother Daughter Wisdom"" to break the cycle of poor health with my own daughters. Thanks Dr. Northrup!Mother-Daughter Wisdom: Understanding the Crucial Link Between Mothers, Daughters, and Health"
4,Great movie for kids who love sportsl!!,My son saw this movie at school-age care and loved it. I ordered a copy and was quite pleased with the storyline. I would encourage all parents who have kids in sports to rent or buy this movie. It teaches a very valuable lesson about using your god-given talent.
5,All Judy,"This originally aired on PBS in the late eighties. Thrilled to have it on DVD. If you like Judy, this is a must have!"
2,Designs are very simple,"Although the book has interesting designs, they are too simple for what I am looking for. Most of the designs don't offer the posibility of coloring them in different ways to achieve different results. If you are looking for designs that REALLY defy your creativity look for the ""Altair Design"" and the ""Roger Burrows"" books..."
4,second to one,"Only Ruth Heller's ""designs for coloring:geometrics"" book beats this one, and not by much. You will want to copy almost every one of these 5 times. the possibilities are mindblowing and the paradoxical nature of the designs equally so. I'm afriad to color any of them untill they have been copied. That is actually the only drawback I can see. Hard to believe but that is what brings it down to a 4 to me: I can't use this yet. These designs, at first glancs, appear deceptively simplistic. believe me they are trickier than you think. Take your time to study them before you do anything."
1,Video on Dvd......Why didn't they use the opportunity?,"""Kultur"" had the opportunity to present 4 ""Garland"" specialswith the same class as ""Pioneer"". All four dvds sadly arejust the old videos put on dvd....no restoration of any kindvisually or audio. I guess that ends hope for these 4 shows....very sad!!"
5,A great collection!,"Even though I ordered it late and it came from overseas and it was around the busy Christmas season, I received it shortly after Jan. 1. It was factory wrapped and brand new."
3,Not Rodi's Best - But Still Decent,"Overall, I have enjoyed Robert Rodi's novels tremendously. I've read them all except for the Birdcage novelization, and I will continue to read his works. My favorite is probably Closet Case, but they're all good. Of all of them, I enjoyed Kept Boy the least. If you've read any of Rodi's other novels, Kept Boy basically delivers the same type of thing. I think what killed Kept Boy for me is the main character. For the story to succeed, the protagonist needs to be likeable, and Rodi never manages to make this happen - at least in my opinion. As a result, I had to read about someone I didn't care for, and I even had to put up with this person receiving a very undeserved happy ending. Anyway, I don't mean to sound as if I flat-out disliked the book. Even the least of Rodi's works is still pretty good, and if you liked the others, you'll probably like this one (though perhaps not as much)."
2,lacks literary merit,"This book is a fast reading novel that is interesting, but has anything but a complex plot.... California Screaming is much better..."
5,Insightful and thought provoking look at grief,"Conquering the Mysteries and Lies of Grief opens a window to grief's confusion. The book offers awareness, fresh insights, and encouragement to all who are grieving a loss. I also found this book to be helpful for all types of loss such as divorce. I have recommended it to my patients that are dealing with life threatening diseases. I have received excellent feedback and wanted to share that fact."
2,Failed to interest me,"As a surgeon who enjoys the writings of other physicians, I was disappointed with Judith's Pavilion. His metaphors and analogies are frequently a bit far fetched. The writing lacks coherence while his stream of consciousness makes the prose difficult to read. The author rarely points to anything profound or intriguing, though he does write with conviction. There are plenty of other reflective books about medicine that would be better to sample than Judith's Pavilion. If this genre interests you, try something by one of these physicians: Paul Brand (The Gift of Pain, Fearfully and Wonderfully Made), Oliver Sacks (The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Awakenings), Lewis Thomas (The Lives of a Cell, The Youngest Science), Richard Selzer (Mortal Lessons, Letters to a Young Doctor), David Graham (Thoughts Along the Way), Harold Klawans (Toscanini's Fumble, Newton's Madness), or Sherwin Nuland (The Wisdom of the Body)."
3,A solid work with room to grow,"I tried not to let my disappointment in the book's contents be reflected in my rating of it.This book is about life and death, mistakes, regrets, transience, and a milieu of philosophical issues. The fact that the author is a specialist in neurosurgery has little to do with the book itself, except perhaps as evidence that scientists can be poetic writers as well. Admittedly I was hoping more for a book dealing with the issues and details of neurosurgical patients and their outcomes.The prose was lovely and poetic, though fraught with metaphors. It was hard to follow at times, seeming more like a recording of a stream of consciousness. The book was not particularly mesmerizing reading, but it did hold my interest at a moderate pace."
3,"Good primer for newbies, but not great","For someone who's entirely new to home theater -- from A/V receivers to speakers to display monitors to hooking everything up -- ""Home Theater for Dummies"" offers a quick primer on the subject. It covers both sound and sight and gives honest opinions on many things.However, it suffers from excessive use of parenthesis and side notes and confusing run-on sentences. Also, the explanation of key topics such DVI and a display's aspect ratio still leaves the reader highly confused. The trouble seems to stem from the fact that neither author has a deep grasp of the home theater technologies and they might have just lifted all this information from various sources and put it in book form.Since the book is cheap on Amazon, I still recommend it to all newcomers to the wonderful world of home theater. If you need more information, get the optimizer discs the books recommends and also check the web for detailed discussions."
5,Solid,"This is a pretty solid lock, it wont be yellow like in the picture but black. Don't really care what color, it works as it should."
3,the lock is fine but there are two pieces,"It might not be a problem for others, but for me it didn't work out. I lost the u-shape part of it when I put the lock into my panniers. The lock was fine otherwise."
1,Somebody was having a bad day,I ordered this and another DVD for my grandmother for Christmas as she was in declining health and I wanted something peaceful for her. what I received was some sort of soft core porn! Some person or thing at the sorting center probably thought this was funny. Nice job guys. Way to rack up that karma. Shame one you for what you did.
5,Very clear sounding,"Pros:1. Clean Sounding, does not sound tinny like some of the other sub $50 speakers I have listened to.2. Auxiliary port and Headphones port on the speaker3. Independent bass and treble control4. Was impressed by the packaging of the speaker systemCons:1. The bass was a little weak compared to a similar Cyberacoustics system, though the front speakers are clearer2. The power switch is on the sub-woofer3. Speaker wire length is very limited, enough for a desktop speaker, but just about.Conclusions:Nice sounding speakers, will not rock you, but good enough for listening to music and occasional movies. Not recommended for gaming. Don't expect 100 dollar performance in a 30 dollar speaker, if you want better look at Klipsch Promedia 2.1 for music and Logitech Z-2300 for gaming."
4,These speakers say a lot,"Good product for the price. Good sound quality. I was disappointed because I found that I have to keep the cables away from other cables behind the compter or I will get a loud ac hum through the speakers, but for the price I supppose I shouldn't expect the cables to be shielded."
5,My Fav. Chinese Movie,"Sammi is my all-time favorite Chinese actress and singer. She is captivating in any performance, but ""My Left Eye Sees Ghosts"" is just extraordinary. This was the first Chinese movie I'd ever seen, just one year ago, but I'll never forget my first. I can honestly recommend this film to anyone who wants a good laugh, and perhaps a good cry."
4,4 and plus,every english word is defined with subtle nuances having more than one example sentences written first in japanese and then in english.sentences are generally not long but giving a good sense of the word in the context.a brand-new great help.I recommend.
3,.,it was alright worked fine. don't like the band but my bf said it worked fine and it was a good buy so whatever.
4,"A quaint, fun diversion","Kate Sutton, at the order of Queen Mary, has been sent to live in a lonely, remote castle called Perilous Gard. Upon arriving, she learns of the mysterious disappearance of a small girl that occurred a few months prior, and of the strange behavior of the castle's residents. Rumor has it that the child had been abducted by Fairies. Having little else to occupy her time, Kate makes a bold decision to try to solve the mystery herself. The story was a little dry, and the romantic element felt a little too pat at the end, but the story was otherwise charming."
2,disappointment,"I really don't get how this book has so many good reviews. My friend was just raving about it, and I had high hopes because the plot looked interesting. I read it, regretted starting it after the first chapter, but didn't stop because my friend wanted me to finish it, and I was hoping that it would get better. No such luck.Although the plot is original, the characters are shallow. Kate is the perfect little mary sue whose only flaw is (my oh my!) clumsiness! The romance between Kate and Christopher was bland and unemotional.All the dramatic scenes in the book were... off. I felt like whenever something was supposed to be frightening or shocking, the simple and slow paced language threw me off, and I had to read the page over again to be sure that anything important had actually happened.The story droned on and I actually had to force myself through most of it... Hate to be a downer but it really wasn't that great."
1,waistbands twist after 2 washings,"I bought several of these because they were so comfortable. To my dismay, after about 2-3 washings, the elastic waistband (on nearly every pair!) because twisted, curled, and warped within the fabric. Now, who feels comfortable returning used underwear to a store? Not me. I felt pretty screwed. I will never buy Bali again."
5,Alanis singing a few songs live.,"In this single Alanis sings three live songs, and one album version was recorded. 1: Head Over Feet (album)2: You Learn (live on March 6, 1996) A good version of ""You Learn"" however they cut out the extended part when Alanis beats on the cymbols.3: Hand In My Pocket (live on March 6, 1996) The croud really goes wild in this awesome version. However instead of saying ""I care but I'm restless,"" it sounds like ""I'd kill but I'm restless.""4: Right Through You (live on March 6, 1996) This version is a fairly good one. However, she has done better. The croud gows absolutely with the first line of ""Wait a minute man!""A good good single"
4,Cute but Small,"I bought this for my niece's first birthday. It is a very cute little cake with fun things for little ones to play with. I should have read the product description a little better because I was expecting the cake itself to be a little larger. Other than that, it was a great gift."
2,Best of:,"This CD has all of Neil's hits. I feel his best song is ""The World Through a Tear."" I gave it low review because of the poor sound quality. You can clearly hear distortion in all the songs. I expected better sound quality from a CD."
1,Crappy Web Site...,"I was reading the high reviews of Zonealarm so I went to their web site to get more information, and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up. Makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them. Going back to Panda..."
3,"Saw It in Moviehouse, many enjoyed it.","If I remember correctly, this movie spent two weeks at #1 at the US Box offfice, which would indicate that either the moviegoing public found it amusing and/or just plain fun. The opening sequence is colorful and attention getting, as is the ending. In between it becomes, a road trip picture, with the 3 Drag queens, getting stuck in some no-name town. Watching, macho men Swayze & Snipes, & John Lequizamo (Chi Chi Rodriguez?), as drag queens is a blast. Thank goodness for actors. They do for this movie, what most movies should do, forget real-life problems and just enjoy yourself, if only for a couple hours."
5,Ya gotta love it!,"I'm usually a very conservative person, but I thought this movie about DRAG QUEENS (of all liberal things) was one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Not only was the acting excellent, the music totally grooves you (though I was hoping the soundtrack would have more of the songs they used in the movie), and the whole movie is very quotable. It's not for children or people who can't see the humor in things that they might not like, but for those who are open-minded, I recommend this movie enthusiastically."
5,Got my gift and loved it,"It shipped in the time it was supposed to, it was a great price, and there were no problems receiving it."
2,A missed opportunity,"The cast is stellar, but not in this movie. The premise is great and was done much better in the land of OZ. The opportunities were many and they missed them all with a weak script, uninspired acting and throw away lines.Why did I give it two stars ?? The final and only shot of Julie Newmar at the end of the movie"
5,One of the best movies ever,"Since everyone's written so much all I have to say is that this movie is entertaining on all levels from beginning to end, colorful, great message, funny, deep, shallow... just watch it!"
3,Disappointed with Packaging for Mail,"I wasn't as happy this time with Movie Mars as I have been in past purchases. The movie arrived later than anticipated and the DVD box was either tampered with or broken during shipping. As a collector I feel the box is important and when it is damaged it doesn't display well. Other than that I have had many positive purchasing experiences with Movie Mars, and I do plan to continue purchasing from them."
4,Like them!,"I bought these to be sturdy boots to ride a motorcycle with, while still being feminine. They definitely stood up to the challenge. I don't know if the boots I got were old, or sitting in a non-climate controlled storage, but the leather was dry and brittle when i got it. I used Mink Oil and a LOT of boot polish to make these wearable boots. But, now that they are repaired, they are comfortable, and sturdy, and exactly what I wanted them for."
1,THE EMMETT TILL/ TRUE STORY,I have not yet received my order. I have written the supplier several times looking for my order. No one have answered my request. Please find my order and ship it to me ASAP. I think that the failure to respond to my inquiries and responses is a sign of poor business performance.
4,emmit till documentary,"I have seen other documentaries on Emmet Till, but this one somehow impacted me in a way others have not. Heart -wrenching!!"
5,Excellent...Very Informative,I learned quite a bit from watching this DVD regarding the death of Emmett Till. It was very well put together with first account interviews from family and friends. I recommend all family members to watch and learn a piece of history.
3,Good rice BUT......,"I have been making rice with this cooker for 2 months now. It spews starchy boiling rice water on my counter every time I make rice. But,, I like the rice it makes. It is much better than what I made on the stove top. I was considering returning this cooker and getting another, as I checked the reviews, I found that many others had this same problem. I have decided to keep it; I worked out a little system of putting down 3 paper towels on the counter and when the cooking is done, I wrap up the mess and throw it in the garbage."
3,too small and too slow,"So far it is not a bad product. The only negative side is it takes more than 30 minutes to cook 10 cups rice. It is much longer than the one I used to use.And also be ware that its capacity is ten cups cooked rice, not ten cups uncooked rice. It makes a big different."
2,Dont buy this.,Author Cat Woods is verbally constipated and goes on for endless pages without ever coming to a point. She's long winded and excessive in words and I would just as soon use this book as a door prop than anything else. I would suggest choosing another book by a different author and never buying anything she writes.
1,Mistakes Mistakes and More Mistakes.,"That's what this book should be called.Trust me , you don't wanna own this book, you'll just bewasting your money.I'm well beyond disappointed w/ this book.But hey, what do you expect when you're writing a bookabout a version of software that you're obviously not evenusing. How else could I be getting errors about obsolete files?If the files that come w/ the book are obsolete, then the software that made them was an earlier version of max.Thus the reason for the mistakes, max 4 is slightly different.What do all these mistakes mean to the person trying to learnmax 4 ? It means you'll be misguided most of the time and you'llend up pulling out all your hair.I highly recommend not even going near this book! You'll onlybe sorry , like I am. I should've bought the max bible.Shame on me. :("
5,Good Times on the Can,"Best bathroom reading since this huge book of ""Far Side"" comics my mom got me when I was little. Using the toilet is one of the greatest times of the day. It is made that much better while reading ""Ruminations""."
2,Not so great,"As a guy in early twenties and gotten out of college recently, this book feels like it has been written by a high schooler. Ive never read anything so mundane and uninteresting. This book does not hold your interest at all and it was a pain trying to read through the first two chapters because i thought it would get better, but i gave up. I was hoping for some interesting quirky written book, but this is just pure trash, i cant believe it got published. But anyways, thats just coming from my perspective, others may feel differently."
1,A tree died to make this book???,"Looking for a light-hearted gift for my dad as he approached retirement, I thought that this book might fit the bill. Was I wrong! Amazingly, a book covering topics along the line of retirement, this was written as if a teenager were to read it. Don't get me wrong... I'm not one of those types that doesn't appreciate immature humor. This was not humorous... just stupid."
1,Road to Hong Kong,"I purchased this movie and it came from overseas. It was advertised that this movie is compatible with DVD players. This is false, I purchased this movie to add to the other 6 ""Road To"" movies, so that I could have the complete set, and I have not been able to watch it. This DVD movie from overseas will not play on my Sony HD DVD recorder/player. So now I will to try and find another seller, so that I can have the complete set."
1,An insult to Bruce,"After Bruce Lee's death, there were a motley crew of imposters trying to jump on the fame band wagon of the ""Dragon"", there was Bruce Le, Bruce Li and Dragon Le, some were good most were corny, but they were given some note of credibility; to an occidental audience due to the well known actors who worked with them in these films, (this is what made Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle a hit, by using wen Wo Ping as choreographer and veteran actors and real masters like Chiu Chi Liang and Yuen Wah.The most incredible thing about Bruce Lee is that some of his fight movements had to be slowed down in order to be visible to the audience,hence shooting scenes were the camera is obviously speeded up cheapens the integrity of the kung fu, such as in this mediocre flik and the overated Iron Monkey."
2,A frustrating device,"I had high hopes for this touch pad. I am not especially happy with it. It is rather difficult to scroll with it. It takes a very steady hand & patience to operate, & simply slows me down. Highlighting for copy & pasting is very frustrating. If you are trying to remedy a sore wrist or carpal tunnel, look into the Quillmouse. It's rather expensive ($100) but MUCH better than a touchpad."
5,wonderful commentary on American citizenship,Great for anyone who wants to emigrate to the United States and become a citizen or anyone who has relatives desiring to do so.
4,Better than most people think,"I AM an long time fan of this series, and I greatly enjoy the direction that the new writer is taking this series. This new writer DOES know the history of the characters and is incorporating their past into the growth of the characters. A lot of old fans are disappointed that their favorite characters are changing, but it is boring to read book after book of the same non-changing characters. Remo HAS changed and so has his relationships with the other characters. All the characters are growing and changing. There are many different plot threads that span many books and this new writer is using them to advance the characters. I am more interested in the series now than I was in the past.This latest book was a quick fun read. New readers will enjoy the fast pace and interesting characters and their relationships with each other. Long time fans should enjoy the continuity of the plot threads."
4,adequate textbook,a good textbook for nursing management or a similar course - descriptive and comprehensive.
3,It's easy to see why you have to purchase the whole album...,"...because if you could just download the individual songs, the second half of the album (the tracks *inspired* by the movie and not *in* the movie save for one) would be easily be left to the ages by all. Still, the first half is easily worth the entry fee for South Park fans and as such feels a lot less draining than buying a half good CD."
5,This CD is a hundred times better then Chef-Aid.,"Ive heard the songs: ""Im Super"", ""Good Love"", ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"", ""Through The Eyes of A Child"" and the remix of ""Kyle Mom"". I think this CD sounds great and alot better then Chef Aid.The Big Gay Al song is hilarious!"
3,5 stars if Joe C wasn't on it.,"Everyone buying this album obviously knows that the swear words are what give this album somewhat of an edge over any other musical in history. The songs are great to learn the words, and fun to impress your friends whom have always wanted to know the words, but just fake it. My problem in the CD is the songs covered by other than the South Park crew. Namely Joe C., that irritating shadow of Kid Rock. If it isn't enough to see that little kid all over TV forcing us to change the channel, but he tries his voice out for ""Kyle's mom is a big fat b**ch."" With so much talent on this CD, this one song ruined it. Skip this song, and you will be filled with laughter. Trey and Matt, you've done it again! Best wishes on great success!"
5,I think that the new cd rocks . It is going to be a hit,"This cd rocks it has the best movie for people who like hard rock, and for those who don't, you will really start getting used to it and maybe you will like the music more. But i give this cd a 5 stars because it really rocks. You won't be able to get it out of your mind."
3,"Great acting, marred by ""artistry""","The acting in this film is top-notch, or very close to it. The story line is great, and the plot of pretty solid. What makes it hard to watch are the director's (an Asian Tony Scott?) continual attempts to make the film "":artistic"" by blurry/stop-motion shots that really add nothing to the film at all and actually detract from its continuity. You're initially not sure if you're watching a flashback or live action. Shame; just letting the camera roll would've done the movie far more justice."
3,Not a bad little movie to curl up with at home,"""My Blueberry Nights"" features a sweet, delicate story perhaps overwhelmed by a too showy directorial style. Norah Jones is very appealing, though, and supporting turns by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and especially David Strathairn (as a troubled police officer who Norah meets on the road) lend gravity to the film.A brief making-of/behind-the-scenes special feature is mildly interesting, but it's outdone by a half hour or so onstage interview with director Wong Kar Wai, which took place at New York's Museum of the Moving Image. The interview is illuminating and interesting, as the director discusses the film and the differences between directing in China and the United States.If you're expecting a lot, you'll find ""My Blueberry Nights"" a little underwhelming. But if you're open to a simple story where emotions and feelings take precedence over innovative story points, you'll likely enjoy it well enough."
3,Boring but slightly good,"On the extras, Norah Jones said that this movie plays out like a jazz song. I think that is an accurate description. My Blueberry Nights is upbeat, harmonic, soulful, and has a strong sense of rhythm with improvised camera work (which can be a bit grating at times). The story is very basic, a girl deals with her heartbreak by visiting a pie shop and soon runs away from a potential romance by traveling across America where she meets offbeat characters while sending postcards to her potential love interest. The actors push a mediocre storyline into a kinda good movie, particularly Rachel Weisz, David Strathairn, and Natalie Portman."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought the Cuisinart for the name. Big mistake. After mashing the garlic, the little basket is consistently pulled out and PLOP! falls right into the food you merely wanted garlic in. So....if it falls into very hot olive oil, it can splash onto your hand and you have to quickly find something to pull the basket out of the oil. Bottom line, be forewarned----clever design in the boardroom, very poor design for the kitchen!"
5,I think this is an outstanding selection.,"After I have been through many consulting and strategy courses, Dan reveals a simple approach to help improve your business. I feel the book is rather dense, so don't expect to get through it in a night. Dan says a manager have 5 freedoms that a manager/ ceo can control: 1)choosing the right business, 2) right strategy 3)right systems, 4)right structure 5)right people. After knowing some successful consultants, this book goes further than most have taught me. Dan reveals his consulting strategies that apparently have put his services in high demand. Powerful knowledge."
2,Anycom Bluetooth USB adapter,It works but crashed my Windows XP several times and I stopped using it. To me it is worthless and would not recommend to anybody.
2,Doesn't work on my system without purchasing addl software,I found this worked on my Vista 32-bit system only with the BlueSoliel software that the vendor provides as a download on their site. The problem is that it is unlicensed and only runs for a very short time at which point you have to purchase the software. Sent it back.
2,always a problem,"has a lot of problem with configuration:comp does not want to find it,then even when it ""connected"", some time I can see internet, some time not,then after some time on start it does not want to connect, and I have to reinstall driverfinaly it stop working"
1,Never worked !,This dongle was something I brought long time back. Writing a review very late and my apologies. This dongle never worked for me. When I placed this to my laptop usb and after running all the installations and instructions.. it just hung my laptop. It would freeze the whole laptop and you cannot do anything else other than hit the restart button ! I tried this on Windows XP and Windows 7.
2,USB Bluetooth Wars,"It took me about three hours to get this stupid thing working, including downloading new drivers and trying to make sense of incomprehensible instructions. Out of the box, it was totally useless. The drivers did not work at all."
4,Good small and works good for the price,"This is a good product for its price, but I think it causes a little interference at more than 10 ft. I need to verify before I can conclude on that. It is just a guess at this point."
2,Worthless for Windows 7,"I had this same device I had bought from a PC running XP, and it worked fine. Not the fastest, but it worked. It installed fairly easily.Despite the fact that it SAYS on the package that it's compatible with Windows 7, IT IS NOT. This dongle will not work with Windows 7. It will not install properly, and you will be unable to connect to any device. Any attempts to get updated drivers from Sabrent resulted them in asking that I BUY a driver from them. I'm returning this piece of junk tomorrow.It gets 2 stars because it worked on XP."
1,BLAH!,"i know this is not meant to be takin seriously, but can't they make a song without being so damn annoying? and this also gives a bad message out to the younger kids whom this is targeted (around the 5 to 10 year old age) kids in that age group are easily influenced and this is a bad influence for them....so STICK YOU DAPHNE AND CELESTE!"
2,Coochy-coo,"SUMMER LOVERS provides an interesting take on the exploits of an unmarried couple vacationing where the swingers swing. Daryl Hannah shows just what happens when a woman gives it up to a man without a wedding ring (or even an engagement ring): her boyfriend (Peter Gallagher) takes even further advantage! He does nothing to hide his attraction to a single woman they meet; he beds her down and then brings Daryl in to make it a threesome. Gals, what won't you do to please a man?Daryl Hannah's character demonstrates a tickling fetish. At one point, she ties the boyfriend down, arms over head, and tickles his underarms. She should have socked him in the face while she had the chance. SUMMER LOVERS came out right before AIDS became a household world. H.I.V., R.I.P., young people who see SUMMER LOVERS as a fantasy instead of a warning."
3,IDIOTS!,"One of the most appealling features of this lightweight but charming movie is the lovely cinematography of Santorini. So why didn't they release this on DVD in widescreen??? Instead they cut off nearly half the visuals to make it full-screen. Idiots! Had it even occurred they might do this, I would have checked the aspect ratio of the DVD and I wouldn't have bothered to buy it. Rather, I would have waited and hoped for a decent version to eventually come along... which is what I doing now anyway."
2,Incredibly Overrated!,"Somebody please tell me why this predictable, boring movie gets such high reviews from so many people! Is it the plot? Can't be, since you can anticipate every part of the movie, it is so cliche-driven. Is it the nudity (none from Daryl; sorry, guys)? That doesn't really save it. Is it the scenery? Well, the Greek island it is set on is incredibly beautiful. In fact, it is the best part of the movie. Might as well watch it with the sound off, so you don't have to listen to the dreadful dialogue.But even the scenery is ruined on the DVD version of this movie, since it is in 4:3 format, and the video quality is so bad. Fans of DVDs be warned - stay away from this poorly done disk!If life is going by too fast for you, you might want to watch this - it will be the longest 90 minutes of your life!"
2,Have an afternoon to waste?,"Some assembly is required. I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things... I have an engineering degree... I've put together bikes, furniture, installed car stereos, and this thing was an absolute pain, especially for such a simple device. I found the instructions to be woefully inadequate.I found the images to be useless, and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together. Takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance.It was aggravating enough to make me go straight to Amazon upon finishing to leave feedback... I didn't even buy it from Amazon.The gate itself is fine."
4,Good gate,"We actually have 4 of these at various points around the house to keep our twin toddlers corralled. A lot of this has been said before: you need to be very handy, have a lot of patience, have a good degree of skill, have the correct tools and be very precise when installing this gate. If not, hire someone to install it for you. I did not have to deal with any angles as all of ours are installed square. Each one took me about an hour to get fully installed.Once they are installed properly, they are very strong and fairly easy to use."
2,In plain sight,"Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind. The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program. The dialogue is forced, the voiceover is annoying, the domestic squabbles are comedic at best. Marshall Mann has zero personality. Bobby D (Todd Williams) is probably the best and only good thing in this show."
5,Another incredible masterpiece by Bill Amend!,"If you like Foxtrot, you'll like this book! 256 pages of hilarious comedy. And they're not kidding when they say ""enormously."" Enormously funny!"
4,Womenspiring!,"If you're craving more Sex & The City / Waiting To Exhale type movies, with a 4 star-female ensemble cast, this film is for you! Annette Bening is her usual amazing self. Candice Bergen is always phenomenal to watch (and someone we can't seem to get enough of, these days). Eva Mendes' performance is the best I've seen of her & my favorite of her roles played, to date! And the actress who plays Meg Ryan's teenage daughter gives a precious performance, as well. This film is a remake of the 1939 version of The Women, which I'd love to see. Interesting note: There is not ONE male actor anywhere in this film, which was a goal of the project--to make a film exclusively about women. This is definitely a wonderful curl-up-alone-with-a-girl-movie film, when you are needing one!"
2,Meg Ryan - no Norma Shearer,"If you are going to watch this movie you should definitely watch the 1939 version starring Norma Shearer (in the role Meg Ryan attempts to play) and Joan Crawford (Eva Mendes's role) first - because, not only is the acting in the 1939 version better, but the plot fits the times better. And although Debra Messing came very close to having that same comedic timing that the '39 cast showed - the 2008 version just doesn't stand up next to the 1939 - nor will it stand the test of time.However if you are a huge fan of Sex and the City and the like you will probably like this film. But... If you like the classics like I Love Lucy and Singin'In The Rain - then the 1939 version is DEFINITELY the one you should watch."
3,Lightweight estrogen comedy,"The Bottom Line:It's not only the lack of any actor with a Y chromosome that makes The Women feel like it should be airing on the Lifetime network: between the ham-handed direction, weak writing, and superfluity of characters in a short film, The Women is a featherlight comedy that might be the type of film to watch on an airplane but that's about the best recommendation I can muster.2.5/4"
5,Superb in every way,"I just sat and watched this film for the first time with my wife who is enjoying her first day of her Christmas break. We were both blown away by the great story lines and the quality of the acting. The casting is right on, and each individual performance is excellent. A brief scene in which Candace Bergen, a mother tells her daughter how it felt to be betrayed by an unfaithful husband was, in my opinion, worthy of an Academy Award best supporting nomination. I've always enjoyed her comedy, but this was a fine dramatic performance. I can see that many have panned this film, and I cannot understand why. It's a keeper."
3,I wouldn't buy it,"The Women's cast is an amazing lineup featuring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Eve Mendes, Debra Messing, Jada PIckett Smith, and the list goes on. I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The movie is a story about Ryan's character Mary Haines. Mary's husband is cheating on her with the ""spritzer girl"" at Saks. Mary's friends find out and try to find a way to tell Mary, but she already knows. We watch Mary fall apart and then pull it all back together.There's a part in the film where Mary has now gained her confidence back and she realizes that she wants to accomplish some things on her own merit. She has renewed vigor about life. Her mother asks her what brought about these changes. Mary replies, ""Hitting bottom. Having nothing else to lose. I highly recommend it.""I loved that quote. Its inspiring for anyone that is feeling like she has hit bottom and for all of those who have pulled themselves out of that valley."
2,Could Be Better,"There were some cute moments in the film, but personally, I found the film really lacking in substance. The film didn't dig deep enough into Jada or Debra's role--both of which could have been cut from the film and still left the storyline in tact--and there wasn't enough of a storyline to actually hate Eva's character as the money-hungry mistress or get angry at Annette's character for selling out her best friend.I received a complimentary copy to review."
1,not a good seller,"The person did not not that the case in which the movie came in was all cracked up so,I returned the product to her and still have not received my payment yet. On the invoice it stated that the case was cracked but not on the movie review page on amazon.I have yet to see the movie, I have to purchase another one."
5,Great cast and story!,"My future daughter in-law and I watched this on a cold winter afternoon while the guys were watching football. What a pleasant surprise! The story was very realistic without sex and violence that would have made it uncomfortable to watch with my son's young fiance. So settle in with a bottle of wine, the mani-pedi tools and enjoy this movie with a girl friend!"
2,"Great cast, bad movie","I guess it'd be fine in you really love one of these actresses, but the writing is clichéd and even."
1,What a waste!,"I read the bad reviews of this film but watched the DVD anyway. The film was even worse than the reviews. I think the worst thing about the film was that it ended quite abruptly without any resolution. When the credits began to roll, I was left feeling clueless.The film started out okay--the dialogue was alright and the acting was fine, and I was amused by Annette Bening's character. However, after about the first half, the film went nowhere.It lacked the sharpness of the original and the famous line (""There's a word for women like that..."") was uttered within the first minute of the film and utterly wasted."
1,Skip it,"Well, with this terrific cast, I had my hopes up, the bad reviews notwithstanding, but boy, was I wrong. What a disaster from start to finish, with very contrived dialogue, poor direction and the actors looking like they were struggling to make the best of bad material. I was shocked that Diane English, a very talented and funny writer was behind this travesty. Definitely a waste of time - skip it!"
5,This is the MOST FANTASTIC pet product on the market today!,"I own a little white dog that sheds everywhere 3 times or so a year! I have a dark couch - so, 3 times a year, I couldn't invite people over. StickySheets ended that problem for me! They are fantastic. I could use one of these large sheets and get the whole couch in a couple of minutes, it would have taken hours with a lint roller and about 10 what it took me with a vacuum. They even get into the little crevaces. I have used them so many other places too - like on the bottom of a cardboard box to make it water proof when I'm transporting gooey stuff in the car. This product is such a god-send!"
1,DONT BUY THIS FILM,Just plain horrible. I can't belive this GHETTO piece of garbage got picked up and distributed. I plan to find the filmmaker who made this and PUNCH him real hard in the face.
4,Absolutely Magical,I was swept away by the sheer beauty of this love story. Jude Law was brilliant in his portrayal of an artist seeking out his one true love. Gretchen Mol was captivating as her family's caretaker. Their words and movements were beautiful as you watched the entire family discover what true love can be.
5,music from another room,"What a wonderful movie, from start to finish it draws you in and makes you want for more... six star if you ask me"
4,Wonderful film,What a wonderful film. I can't believe that this film is not for sale. I't is the best romance movie I have seen. Jude Law is an extraordinary actor. I have now become a big fan of his. This film is a must see.
3,"Nothing Outstanding, but Reliable","If you need a combination corded/cordless phone, then this is a good choice."
2,Joystick button stops working on handsets after several months!,"Bought this unit at costco. Everything was OK until joystick button on a cordless handset started to fail. Bought another handset. Half a year later, joystick button fails on this one too. I can access phonebook only through the joystick button, so this option is practically useless now.This problem is common for many Uniden phones, so buyers beware."
4,Excellent - not quite perfect,"I thought about giving it 5 stars, but settled on 4. Maybe 4.5 stars.Cons: I cannot figure out how to keep the answering machine from beeping when a new message is has been received. This makes it difficult to sleep in the same room when the machine is beeping. And I'm not quite sure why phone manufacturers refuse to use cords between the handset and base that can be easily extended by simply removing the cord and replacing it with a longer cord. So many phones seem to have at least one end permanently connected, and I'm not about to start deconstructing phones to replace cords.Pros: Range and batter life is pretty good, for how much we use it. Love the ability to intercom and check messages from any remote handset. I feel comfortable using the remote handsets even when giving personal info out since it's all digital. Both the base handset and the remote handsets feel good in my hands and against my ears. I'd buy another and I recommend this product."
4,Uniden PowerMax 5.8 Digital Answering System,"Much time was spent researching this phone purchase because as we all know it is one of the most often used devises in home or office. I am using it in my home office so the things most important to me were ease of use of the answering machine, phone book, speed dial, and cordless phone range,clarity and security. I found all to be outstanding! It was very important that the cordless phone be secure from eavsdropping and even though in the Uniden advertizements it is hard to find out this phone is ""Digital Spread Spectrum"" probably the most effective way of preventing eavsdropping. I am totally pleased with every aspect of this system and would highly recommend it."
2,"good sound, poor service","I bought one of these a year ago, and added several handsets. The sound quality is good. The number buttons are soft and attract dirt, and you have to keep cleaning them. However, this last week the main base phone failed for no reason. After repeated attempts to reach customer service, and no response from Uniden, I am trashing the entire setup. They have one of those endless on-hold numbers; and email with no response. Won't buy this brand again."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this book hoping that that it will give me concrete advice and examples of complete teaching portfolios. Yes, there are example documents and lists of things that you can include. However, I felt I got better ideas from just googling ""teaching portfolio"" and looking at the results. The advice contained within this (very thin) book was already available in other books I've read. All in all, a disappointment."
4,I need to buy this reader in Florida,"I'd like to know where I can find and buy this reader in florida. If somebody knew which store have it, please let me know, THANKS."
3,"One big, long workout","I guess I will be the first to deviate from giving a 5-star review. This video is really nothing more than a 45 minute workout on the drums. That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I found myself wanting more. It's not that I thought there was anything wrong with Mr. Donati's delivery, and surely his playing can't be faulted, However, I just didn't find a whole lot to take away from this one. I'm sure Mr. Donati has more than enough dedication to the instrument to spend 40-45 minutes warming up before every practice, but I know I don't. I imagine most other drummers don't either. I would have rather heard some of Mr. Donati's thoughts on the more musical aspects of drumming rather than focusing so much of this video on building speed and endurance."
2,No Groundbreaking Stuff,"I'd bought this album purely on Armand's reputation, and much to my disappointment, I found little new and interesting sounds in this album. Many tracks sounded similar, and lacked intensity and variation. If you're after fresh sounds that will completely change your musical life, buy 4 Hero's ""Two Pages""."
5,USS Poopship Destroyer,"I doubt that this album would sway anyone whom previously disliked them but for those people that scoop anything these guys put out, it's pretty damn cool. Hopefully Dean and Gene will put out a CD with all new material soon but in meantime I'll be paintin' the town brown."
2,Unimpressive and poor battery life,"I was originally planning on buying an el cheapo Bluetooth headset for my LG VX8100 but was up-sold to a more expensive, but brand name headset (this Nokia HS-26W).The only pro that I can think of was the earpiece design. The piece that goes behind your ear is flexible and pretty comfortable. Weight wise it's really light weight.No for the cons... It was marketed as having ~5 hours of talk time, and plenty of standby time to boot. This was my biggest complaint - the battery life was closer to an hour.Another problem which plagues many of the low to mid end boom-less headsets is that there's a horrible echo as in the caller hears their own voice.I used this headset for well over a week before returning it. Having to charge it a few times a day just to handle an hour or two of calls was excessive and unnecessary. Add in the echo problem and there wasn't one good reason too keep this HS."
2,Poor HPL!,"An adaptation of one of H. P. Lovecraft's lesser works, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is a MAJOR disappointment. Director Stuart Gordon squanders what had the makings of a truly chilling, atmospheric horror story by letting it degenerate into a typical blood fest. There are many good touches here (good acting, good production values), but the film is done in by Gordon's penchant for gore. Why can't modern filmmakers understand that blood and guts are not frightening, but simply revolting?Poor Lovecraft must be worn out by turning over in his grave with each new attempt at bringing his stories to the screen. It is a shame that film directors don't understand or appreciate Lovecraft well enough to create something that will satisfy his enthusiasts rather than pandering to the bloodthirsty fans of slasher movies."
2,"This dude directed ""Dagon""?","Look I'll be honest...this isn't just terrible. It's just boring as hell with no real build-up. The direction wasn't bad, you actually enjoy watching the characters---but the script wasn't that polished and the special effects were pretty crappy. But this IS Stuart Gordon we're talking about.Worth watching? Sure. But probably the worst that I've seen from the ""Masters of Horror"" line.""Dagon"" was pretty sweet though."
5,Stunning,"Wow!Ok, so when I watched a clip of Aslyn's video for ""Be The Girl"" I immediately signed it off as adult contemporary pop rock. Another act for the radios.Yeah, first impressions SUCK.This CD was put on constantly in my store, and it grew, and grew, and grew...until I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't want to just hear it at work, I needed it.This CD surpasses anything I could have expected. I compare this to any debut from any soft-rock superstar (Alanis, Natalie Imbruglia...) as she has lots of talent and a huge potential!The standout songs are ""Gotta Get Over You"", ""Golden"", and ""Wally""."
1,She hurt my ears...,"If you want to know what Fiona Apple would sound like, minus a single shred of originality, check out Aslyn for sure.To be fair, I've not listened to her CD. She opened up at a Better Than Ezra show. When she performed ""493-1023"" I tried to break my beer bottle and use shards of glass to slit my wrists.Her fast songs are identical, and barely tolerable. Her slow songs are identical, and nowhere close to tolerable. To call her generic would be overly complimentary."
4,Works perfectly for SmartMedia Cards,"The reader works greatly for smartmedia cards, only make sure to insert the card correctly. I haven't tried with other kind of cards, but the only drawback is that it could have a better eject mechanism for smartmedia cards. It has a green light that blinks when the card is been read, but it's on the top of the unit, so it isn't much visible. BTW, it is pretty fast and the installation was very easy on Win98 and WinMe. Haven't tried on WinXP or Win2000."
3,I wish this book would have been better because I like the author's restaurant,"I have eaten in the author's restaurant and I love uncommon food. However, I can't say that I am fond of this book. It is aimed to a very small group of people that are already so familiar with unusual cuts so they can just jump into recipes. What is really missing in this book is a section on butchering and some interesting background material. Unfortunately, the book almost immediately jumps into recipes. As I said, this approach is fine if you already know your meat or if you have a butcher that has all the information. Many of us would like to know a bit more so that we can talk to the butcher. I have found that not all butchers are instinctively familiar with or interested in all different kinds of cuts. I would also have liked some pictures in the book, that would have added $5 but would anyone really care? I still give the book three starts for the passion of the chef and the uniqueness (today) of his food."
1,dissapointing,"This book is a example of why I don't normally buy books that don't allow me to at least see the table of contents. This book is has very little to do with the street. It is just another martial arts book and not a very good one at that. I was expecting an autobiographic book written by soemone who could share real world exerience with violence and survival. This wasn't that. In fact I can't really descrie what this is. I feel duped. I gave it one star because if you are 15 years old and have no background in any kind of fighting, you might find it interesting."
2,dose not work for cats.,I got this for my cat to keep her out of my bedroom it was ok for the first few days but then she just jump over it my cats smarter then i am so save your money if you want to use this for a cat.
3,It Works,"I need to say that this works. I need to keep cats of of a new leather sofa. This did the trick in one day. With that said, it is very expensive for the quality of the mat. Really only worth about half the price. I would rate it higher if the cost was more inline with the product."
3,scam. 2 are needed,"its overpriced and intentionally designed so you need another one to be effective. Unless your cats are just brain-dead stupid they will figure out how to get around this narrow mat. if you really want to keep them out, get two or more.I stand by my original review. Cats don't respect this product and quickly figure it out."
2,Extremely pretentious,"I'm so sorry to say this, but Lorna can't write. It was very hard following her scattered thoughts and short sentences. I honestly took way too long reading this book because I was simply bored with it. I felt that she was a little self-centered, and did a lot of tooting of her own horn. She even put a quote of her mother's that read ""Lorna is more talented then all of us"" on the back. Is that supposed to persuade us to read her book? She's a very untalented writer so I'm not too sure what she meant by that!It's not a very good book. If you're interested, stick to the books written by actual writers."
4,The first Book you can beleive about Judy Garland?,"I really looked forward to reading Lorna Luft's book about her Mom,Judy Garland.After reading all the other fiction accounts by Ann Edwards,Mel Torme,and all the others to follow.Its a great book,and I have to beleive what I read,but I did see one big lie in the Book,when Lorna said Liza never gave her any credit for saving her life,and making her go to the Betty Ford clinic.I have a 60mins tape were Liza gives Lorna all the credit in the World for saving her life. I think the main reason Liza and Lorna don't speak is because of Sid Luft. Liza knows he's nothing but a money hungrey bum,still trying to make money off of her Mom. Also,I can't beleive Danny Thomas was such a bad person. Everyone says what a saint he was.The kids he has saved alone by The St Jude foundation.I think what we got here is another fiction."
3,MEe Me and my shawdows was more about lorna,I must say it was a good book but it had more about herself more than judy it had some pictures but i thought it would be all about judy.If you would like to talk about judy with me e mail me
1,Brag-A-Thon WATCH OUT FOR FALLING NAMES!!!,"May I ask who died and left Ms Lorna Luft queen of A-list socity? She dropped so many names in this book it almost got to heavy to hold. She a singer I've [tragically] seen her in person preform and I'll tell you she is no where near the singer like her Mother or half sister Liza ,as she said she was in the book, and the complaining about her Mother's fans I have to say really she[Judy] wouldn't have had the magnitude she had if it wasn't for the fans!"
4,Lorna Luft is candid and honest about her life & family,Lorna Luft has written an exellent book about her life with her family and is honest about the struggles she went throu to take care of her mother in the last years of judy's life
1,"After an impressive start, a major let down.","After an impressive, highly readable start, this book descended into a name-dropping, dishy bore. Lorna Luft comes off as a Judy/Liza wannabe, with only a fraction of either one of their talents. What struck me most about this book is that it was a cheap, vulgar attempt to make a buck. How sad is it that you have to dish the deepest secrets about your half-sisters highly personal problems to make some money. Pathetic. That this book ever got published, or even more unimaginable, be made into a mini-series is one of the biggest mysteries of all time. Lorna: shame on you."
5,Woot! X-men at their best,"This is a great run of X-men. Beautiful volume, great color. I hope that Marvel publishes vol. 2. For the price, it's still a good value, you couldn't buy 5 years of comics on the stands today for the same price."
1,TV Damaged - Lousy Customer Service,"I received a defective Philips TV - when I took it out of the box, I heard what sounded like a piece of metal rattling around inside the TV. I received three 33-page manuals (in 3 different languages)on how to use the remote control, but NOTHING about how to set-up the TV! I was able to attach the TV cable to this hunk of junk, but found that the SOUND wasn't working! After 3 hours on the phone talking with 3 different Philips customer service idiots (each time I called, I asked for a supervisor, and was promptly disconnected!), I was told to return the TV - at MY expense - to ARKANSAS, of all places! After this frustrating experience, my opinion of Philips (and their products) is sub-zero. I rated this item as a '1' because there is no '0'. I rate Philips, and their policy, as a 'minus 100'."
4,A fun page turner reminiscent of my college years in DC,"Although admittedly, I was a bit thrown by the title ""Hellified"" (I've always been a square peg with slang...hellified being good not bad) I was delighted by Grant's ability to recreate the 80's college scene in Washington,D.C. Characters develop in a teasingly real way. As a result, I was often forced to laugh at my own coming of age. This book takes you on a journey where you won't want to return. Thank you Mr. Grant for the memories!"
1,Don't make the mistake...,"...Of reading this book. This ""novel"" (and I use the term loosely) was straight wack. If I could give it negative stars I would. The characters lacked depth, the dialogue was trite and the plot was non-existent. I am so mad at myself that I wasted countless hours of my life reading this trash. Having gone to Georgetown, I'm appalled that the Black community there has been represented in this way as a bunch of sex-crazed-drug-trafficking-dirty-deed-doing-just-plain-old-trifling individuals. Is it too late to get a refund?!"
1,Don't Bother with This One,"It's true, what others have written... so easy to open (break into) ! Just give the secured cable a good tug and ""wa-la"" it's open... They look cool and I love the idea of the flexibility... but it's not something you want to entrust you stuff with. I was disappointed with MasterLock for this one... Maybe the one I got was defective, but I can't help but wonder why a plastic latch piece (innards) was used... too easy to manipulate. Maybe if you wanted to keep a toddler out of something, but gee, the amount of force was minimal to gain an ""unauthorized"" unlock. Really, pass on this. Too bad. I really trusted MasterLock too."
3,Did the job,"Bought this to lock up a media cabinet from my toddlers and within a couple days the plastic coating that coated the wire cable had stripped off. That said, it still works and does the job I bought it for. If you are buying this to lock up valuables it might not be the best option. It works well in an airport or train station to detere thefts but there are stronger locks available for true theft protection. This lock's cable is very thin but did the job I needed it to."
1,Very unhappy,"I bought this for a recent trip, intending to use it to secure my camera bag to something less mobile at a photo shoot. I didn't expect it to stand up to a sustained attempt, but just to stop someone from casually carrying the bag away. Before the trip, I tested it for security and it was pretty secure. In the end, I didn't need it on the trip. However, I went to use it this weekend and it was jammed. The cable won't extend/retract smoothly, and the lock won't unlatch. This from just sitting for a couple of months.I would not recommend this lock, even for show."
1,Dead Battery,"I charged the battery straight out of the envelope. The battery charged within a couple of hours and died after 1.5 hours of talk time. It went from half a battery to no battery in less than 10 seconds. I purchased a new battery from Eforcity, not a dud."
4,Does not record to DVD-R DVDRW - But a fine product!,"I purchased this unit not too long ago and find it very reliable as far as playing the multitude of discs that it features. However, upon reviewing the manual many times, I have tried to understand why the Technical Reviewer states that it can record to DVD-R and DVD-RW discs when the manual plainly states this unit can only record to DVD+R & DVD+RW discs.Aside from that, I have found this unit very attractive and reliable. The picture quality is very good and the functions are easy to handle.The greatest feature about this Coby DVDR1300 Player/Recorder is that it has a built-in 5.1 channel tuner which can be hooked up to your TV set. Audio cables are necessary for the sound and included with this unit.Overall, this unit which is reasonably priced is a sure bet for anyone looking for a notably fine product and a satisfactory performance."
3,The Ring + The Ninth Gate = Cigarette Burns,If you saw the The Ring and The Ninth Gate (Johnny Depp) then dont bother to watch this movie. Cigarette burns is a combination of both films. Its not very scary. I give 3 out 5.
5,Very similar to In the Mouth of Madness,"On first viewing, I was somewhat disappointed with ""Cigarette Burns,"" but the more I watched it, the more I liked it. The plot is about a movie that does bad things to people if they even go looking for a print of it; you don't even have to see the film for it to affect you. The commentary track by the authors was informative, but perhaps a little too enthusiastic; it's obvious they are completely thrilled to be working with an established director like John Carpenter. The interview with John Carpenter was also good."
4,Ties ASP and Components together very well.,"This is a very good book for understanding the relationship between Active Server Pages and ActiveX Components, but it is not a beginner's book. The beginning of the book gives you a good introduction into seeing how the different pieces fit together on the web server. Each chapter builds towards the case study at the end of the book. I don't know if it's because Amazon.com has one of the most visible e-commerce operations on the net, but this book uses an on-line bookstore as their case study. This book gives you some real insights into how an e-commerce web operation could work. There is no CD-ROM with this book but you can download the code for the projects from the WROX website."
2,I would not recommend this book,My thoughs are that this book is not well organized and assumes that you know everything about ASP before you even start reading the book.
3,"It's OK, but......","This is a pretty good book but you really have to work at it. It is written by several people and it shows. One chapter will be great and then another will be not so great. My reason for purchasing this book was for using ASP to connect to Access databases on my Intranet. Unfortunately this was one of the not so great chapters.On a high note, Wrox has a great web site and the best customer support I've ever seen. I contacted them with my problems and they stuck with me until I was satisfied. So the book is about 3 stars but the Wrox organization is 5 stars."
5,Nice book but...,"This is a very nice book. I build my own asp connected intranet database with it in one week. However, you need to have some ADO knowledge to understand examples fully. Only one thing I don't like much in the book--it draws too many snakes (when I started a new chapter, I felt nervous looking to the snake's eyes)."
4,the best available,"I think that's the best ASP book for whom with some ASP experience. Very clear description, but if more examples are given, that's will make it a 5 stars plus good."
3,Not Fanless,"This model is not fanless. It uses what Antec calls a ""Hybrid fan design"". Basicly, it allows you to set a temperature at which the fan will come on."
3,Good basic overview of Linux Administration,"I have not yet taken the exam and am planning on reading a couple of other study guides and the exam cram first. I have only been using linux for about 4 or 5 months and use it as my primary desktop operating system. This study guide is easy to understand and appears to cover all of the objectives of the exam except for the hardware objectives. The book does not, however, go into a lot of detail. Linux+ is supposed to be an entry level exam (with LPI and SAIR being mid-level) so this may be sufficient. If the test goes very far into detail (such as asking what ps -aux does rather than what ps does), there might be a problem. I would stronly suggest that test-takers read this book and then follow it with a more in-depth book."
1,A downgrade from the E80H,"The good things about this recorder is that it can burn a DVD in up to 8x faster than real speed and that the database can hold 54 and a half hours in the SP mode as compared to 36 and a half the E80H model did. The bad things about this recorder which makes this a terrible purchase is that the TV Guide listings have never worked even after shutting off my recorder for 36 hours, since the TV listings they had were incompatible with my cable service. Also the machine frequently freezes making this machine idle. You can not record two programs back to back since the second program will never record since the machine records the first program for a minute extra which overlaps the second program and cancels the recording. A best bet is to hunt down the E80H and buy that and buy the E85 if you want an expensive time piece."
2,"it would be pretty nice, if it worked...","I got one of these but it was defective. The arrow keys on the remote didn't work, among other things. Tech support said it was clearly defective, so send it back. I did, and got another one. The second one had bad audio on one of the commonly-used channels. Tech support was baffled; a reboot didn't fix it.The features and design are fair-to-good, but obviously Panasonic has trouble with quality control. I won't be trying a third unit. (I'd give it 3 or 4 stars if I found one that worked.)"
4,the first electronic ghost hunters,"160 pages, indexed. This little book will be interesting to anyone wondering how the current craze for using electronics to hunt ghosts got started in the mid twentieth century. Some of the individuals who conducted these early experiments must still be alive- it would be fascinating to see what they think about EVPs now!"
5,Great Book!!!!,This is the cutest and most fun book I've ever seen. And the grandma descriptions are right on! My grandson loves to look at it - which of course I love! Get this book - youll enjoy it!
3,Poor Design & Dim Light,"I purchased this night light for my toddler's bedroom. Although it looks nice, the Mickey ears do not attach very well to the base and the they are so dark that the night light does not give off as much light as most night lights."
1,Not enough light,I thought this nightlight would be a good purchase for my son's room. It hardly sheds any light. It was a waste of money.
1,poor designn,"Got this night light for our bathroom because we like a light on all night. I thought this would work like a NIGHT LIGHT, you know glow and put off a soft light, nope it does not do this. The mickey head is so dark it's not even made to glow or put off light. There are some cut outs on the BACK of the mickey head that shines the light on to the wall behind the light.Very disappointed with this product, and don't suggest it if you're looking for a true night light with a cool look."
3,Poorer condition than I expected,"There was a great deal of writing and underlining in the script. Had I known how much, I wouldn't have bought it. It isn't illegible, however, so it serves adequate purpose so it's OK enough."
2,Come on.,Only came in a .17 oz container. Got half of what I thought I was paying for. Works well though.
3,Markus Enochson - Night Games,"House full-lengths are always tricky, and if anyone can tackle it successfully, I figure it should be Markus Enochson. His tracks and remixes usually stand head-and-shoulders above others. But on his debut, NIGHT GAMES, he veers more towards R&B, soul and broken beats. Though the tribal thump and spoken word of ""How Is Your Imagination"" starts the album off on the right foot, ""Keep On Getting By"" just doesn't grab me (the delicate ""No Stoppin This"" works better). But ""Love is on the Way"" and ""Hear Me"" hit the right electro soul points with a full kick-drum, and ""Endless Dance"" starts on an abstract tip before the vocals come on full force, like a chorus. And is that a shout out to Thomas Pynchon I hear on the funky ""You Got It""? But Enochson shows his best side with the final track, ""Dub the Noize,"" which backs Rachel Wilkie's spoken word with a deep and meditative journey."
4,Nice pen but not for me,"This is a beautiful pen and very well made, but the square design and very thin nature of the pen made it uncomfortable to me and the ink didn't feel smooth in writing.I imagine the pen is made for a smaller, feminine hand, and while I have more effeminate hands, and not enormous, I could not recommend this pen.I gifted it to a friend who does not like plastic."
2,a pain to watch.....except for the birds themselves...,"Sorry to bust the bubble, but the only good thing about this movie wasthe cgi, Tohoru Masamune's acting and the scenery.Most of the lines from the script ive heard before in other movies, theinside the plane dialog sounded and looked like plan nine from outer spaceNobody gets dirty in this movie.. the girl always have full makeup andnever evidence of dirt on them ..even after rebuilding planes...Anyway....for science fiction fans...this movie has to be watched at least once....then use the dvd for a coaster."
1,"They should not advertise a ""flavor""","I didn't expect a whole lot. Just simply that these tasted like peppermint. There is an nice smell, but hardly anything worth mentioning as far as taste. Might as well have nothing on it. Waste of money in my opinion."
4,Wall-Mount Tool Rack,This is the widest universal rack I could fit into the designated space in my utility closet. I like the way it holds by pressure only and a combination of one or two of these Evriholder items plus some single holders gives me the organization I need.
1,infused with hypocrisy,"Not only is this song mediocre and repetitive, it is chock-full of hypocrisy. Staying with Bobby Brown all those years and saying ""I'd rather be alone than unhappy""? I don't buy it.When did this song come out? When were the pair last together?(I know it's incredibly difficult to leave an abusive relationship, especially when there are children. But the fact that the child's well-being is at stake should also be enough motivation to leave and ""stay gone"".) Who knows, maybe this song inspires Whitney every time she hears it while food shopping... If so, then at least it serves her properly..."
4,Be My Valentine Charlie Brown,"A cute show for valentine's day. Charlie Brown waits for a valentine from someone, ANYONE. Meanwhile, Linus tries to give his teacher a huge box of chocolates. Snoopy has a puppet show with Lucy as less than enthused audience. Snoopy also makes a killer valentine & gives Woodstock one in an odd place. Be My Valentine runs at 25 minutes long.This disc also has two bonus programs: You're in Love, Charlie Brown(25 minutes) & It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown(25 min). All programs have english subtitles. All 3 specials appeal to my children of varying ages and their parents as well :)This is a great dvd for valentines day or as Charlie Brown's teacher would say, ""Mu wa wa wa wa"""
4,Good Pulp Destroyer,"I'm a long time fan of the series; like a lot of people who read Destroyer novels, I have an almost complete run sitting in a box in my den, with a few favorites on the shelf.All in all, this was a solid Destroyer book, more on the Pulpish / Superhero side than the best of the series, but still a good read. There's a nice sense of continuity with earlier books, only one new super power that may bug some readers (I didn't like it), and all the charactes stay in character.The only real weakness was a lack of the solid satire that marks the better Destroyer books. If you're a fan, it's worth a read."
2,Too small,This is too small for a normal car cup holder. It will work but not very happy with the size.
4,It must be REALLY tasty,"I bought this today and gave it to my dog, an 11 month old boxer/greyhound mix (76#) puppy.It took her literally 5 minutes to break this apart and another minute to finish it off before my astounded eyes. I gave it to her, went to the kitchen to grab a glass of water when my husband came out of the bedroom and I said ""look, I gave Maya the new treat... wait a minute, where did it go?"" - she then dropped the final piece on her doggie bed, took a breath, and finished it off. I couldn't believe it! It must taste REALLY good, but I was hoping that would entertain her for a few hours... not a few minutes. Too expensive of a treat, back to compressed rawhides. If you can afford it, by all means go for it, I bet your dog will go nuts for it too. :-)"
3,"Not bad, but the mask is pretty flimsy","The costume is great for any aspiring Jedi, and the mask LOOKS great, but it's foam and definitely shows aging quickly. On top of that, Yoda is about 3 feet tall so older kids look kinda weird in it. Not a bad costume, but I've seen better."
2,Somwhat dissapointed,"I am a Consultant on Cross-Cultural Communication Mexico-U.S. I read this book in a few hours last night in preparation for a research project. I was expecting to find new information or information based on the latest cross-cultural research. Then I looked at the publishing date and found my answer. The first edition is from 1989, thus some of the information even on second edition is outdated. Ms. Kras does a wonderful job comparing and contrasting an exhausting list of cultural values which works as a first step. Yet, I am looking for the next level. What happen to the Mexican and U.S. managers when they actually interact and how those misinterpretations and misunderstandings get resolved effectively?A ""laundry list"" is a good start but does not answer questions nor does give light to getting pass those differences."
5,Good,The DVD was very funny and the singing was great. I would recommend this DVD to my friends and neighbors.
1,Poor Follow Up,This movie needs help. There are no familiar faces only familiar characters. The acting is poor and the plot is thin. A new twist would have been a nice addition. As it is you know exactly what is going to happen. Average characters going through the motions. Save yourself a purchase and some time. Steer clear of this second class movie.
2,glad I only paid a few dollars,cheap.....doesnt hold much cake mix at all.first time I used it it overflowed in my oven and made a huge mess.Very tiny.wont hold a box of cake mix.save your money...gave two stars because it did not stick to pan otherwise would have given it one.
2,Won't stay on,I can't get the earpiece to stay on. It isn't secure and falls off easily. I end up putting a hand over the ear piece which kinda defeats the whole hands free thing. I wish there was some way to make it more secure but I can't seem to find anything online.
4,They don't make them like this anymore,"Not great, but pretty good! It's far from a good movie, but that's why I liked it! It's so bad that it's good! It's pretty entertaining, it's unintentionally hilarious (I laughed a couple of times) and it has some nice gore (I expected more though... I'm never satisfied when it comes to gore)!If you like movies that are so bad that they're good, I can assure you that you'll love this movie!"
4,Taste,"I'd say the book is great, but as the title shows, that's a matter of taste. Some people like their books full of analysis, all filled with moves, and moves and... moves. Others like the books better when the moves are explained by letters, not by moves. That's what this book is about, it explains the moves in a nice way by telling what the thoughts are, and why some moves are so 'natural' to play. It makes you want to think that you can play just like the GM's in the book. Most of the time you're like 'I would have played all those moves as well, cos I understand the meaning of it, this must be a beginners-game', then you look at the names of the players and you see 'Karpov - Kasparov'.For me this is a book which really helped. I think it is a good book for 1700 - 2100 rated players."
4,retired literatire teacher,"Just finished going thru the book for the SECOND time with a hi-lighter and pen ---old habit. Did this the first time in 2009.. and have gotten 8-10 friends to read the series....all of it. Exceptional characterization....good ones have bad traits, bad ones have good sides. Realistically HUMAN. Plot is not predictable for me...and I have lots of experience. I would recommnend it highly for all readers. This is more than a sci-fi story....much more. Some what moralistic....a few far-fetched occurences would be my only criticism. Stirling has done his homework for the most part and depicts early ""homesteading"" activities accurately."
1,Terribly contrived book,"While the idea behind this book was sound, the storyline is laughable.People would frequently find the one person who knew how to construct British longbows, or stumble upon the only guy who knows how to fix a particular type of engine REQUIRED for survival. A few of these coincidences are acceptable, but once they begin stacking up (and they do stack up), the book goes from a good idea to a contrived mess, strung together by life-saving coincidences."
2,Had Potential,"This book had so much potential for a story line- what would happen if all technology suddenly failed? Instead, Stirling made it poorly developed, rather ridiculous, and highly predictable. Yes, I realize that science fiction isn't supposed to be like real life, but it's the good writers who have the gift to make you think that this world is real or could really happen. Stirling just doesn't have that gift. If you're considering this book, I'd say spend your money on something better."
1,Won't Be Finishing,"I can't add much to the extraordinarly humorous and spot-on one-star reviews here, except to say that I agree with them wholeheartedly. I'm only 70 pages into this book, and I am SICK of it. All the Wicca BS, the sudden descent into savagery--yes, it's a RenFaire celebration. Let's all grab the swords we know how to use and for some reason have stocked, and run for the hills.My sister recommended ""Meeting at Corvallis"" to me; I found that this novel was the first in the trilogy, so that's why I checked it out and thankfully did not buy it. I may try that last book though, and hope it's better than this one."
4,A good book to read,"This is a good book to read, because it lets you think what will happen if it is the end of the world and how some the human race band together to survive."
2,Next time a little less Wiccan,"I read a lot of apocalyptic books, and this one had a lot of promise, however whenever it shifted over to Juniper and the Wiccan characters, I was about to scream, ""ENOUGH!"" As characters, they weren't bad, but the constant references to Wiccan, Lord, Lady, making signs, blah, blah, blah. It became as irritating as The Lord of the Rings' constant references to the languages of the Elves, and their songs. Just not necessary. On the other hand, the Bearkillers were very interesting. Not a bad read, but I won't check out the rest of the trilogy."
2,Churning out anything to make a living...,"Mr Stirling is a talented sf writer. He proved it abundantly with the Draka sequence, very well written.Unfortunately, like all writers, he has to make a living even when his muse keeps silent.Dies the fire is the result: throw together a condition which is difficult to believe [for no reason at all, every machine stops working AND explosives do not explode any more], some half-baked research on Wiccan neo-witches, a dash of ""good"" survivalist theories and you'll get this book.It is excruciatingly slow, is not very original in a bleak depiction of a post-apocalypse US, it does not make you think and quite obviously is hijacked to pull you to buy the second volume.Don't even begin with this: you might be very disappointed.ThufirHawat"
2,Wiccan fiction gone out of control,"S.M. Stirling is a wonderful author, and I have treasured his other books, but he has succeeded in ruining my enjoyment of this one by his heavy-handed treatment of the religious beliefs of the Wiccan character, Lady Juniper. I could have accepted this premise without complaint, but the sheer level of detail with which he obsesses on her flakey beliefs grows more grating as I progress further in the book."
1,Good Concept but Big Disappointment,"This book by S.M. Sterling was a big dissapointment to me. It had a very good concept but the new age withcraft spouted by one of Sterling's major characters (Juniper Mckenzie) was both annoying and disgusting. Juniper is constantly praying to this or that ""goddess"" and on at least one occasion prayed to the ""horned one."" I quit reading it after only a few chapters because of that kind thing. It could have been a good book if Sterling would have just kept that kind of crap out of his writing."
3,From an Oregonian,"Unfortunately, I haven't read this book yet (although it is on the way to my house!) but I just wanted to point something out.I lived in Corvallis (yes, the same city) for 3 years - my family went to quite a few SCA (medieval reenactment) events in that area, especially those in North Albany. It is very concievable that there could be many people there who attend, since there currently ARE a lot of people from there who participate in the SCA events.I have heard really great things about this book from a coworker, who was the one who told me about the book to begin with, and I very much look forward to reading it. One thing it seems that this book might teach society (just speculation from hearing about it and reading reviews) is that it is worth it to learn how to live your own life rather than letting machines live it for you (we are trying to avoid living in a society like The Matrix, I hope)."
3,Wicca for beginers?,"Once you achieve the oft mentioned suspension of plausibility this book is a decent TEOTWAWKI senario. Stirling's strengths are in the details of the collapse and the adventures our heros have afterward. However, I found his digressions into Wicca distracting. His treatment of Christian characters as idiots, incompetents, and villians was... more than distracting. The heroism in this book is reserved for the Wiccans and the agnostics (""lapsed Lutherans""). Still, I plan to read the next book in the series. I will keep an eye out for the repetitivness and copying of other work that I have read about in these reviews."
3,good read but has complications,"I think Dies the fire and the rest of the Series is over all a good read, If you ignore the issue of explosives not working. I can see how an event like he describes could effect electrictiy. The problem I have though is how could that effect explosives. Explosives and guns have been around a long time before electricity.Other than that The book tells a good tale about how modern civilation falls apart."
1,somewhat overpriced for what it is,"All the pictures of this item around the internet (and Yakima's web site) show a closed clip (aluminum carabiner) design, but that is not what this one is. Its plastic open clip design won't stay put unless you have some largish items to keep the tension up. So it doesn't work well on something like a fishing pole. Maybe the one being sold here on Amazon is an older design? Would definitely be better if 4 of the clips on one side had adjustable tensioners. It'll work well enough for many things, and it's too much hassle to send it back to Amazon, so I'll keep it. But I feel I was deceived (notice how the picture doesn't show the clips?!! hrm), and I'm disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I read the author's last novel, Switch, and loved it. This memoir, or really a mix of memoir and fiction, doesn't measure up. We don't get anything new about anorexia, sexism, homophobia. I enjoyed the Southern family history sections, but the rest seemed too familiar. Carol Guess says she admires Carole Maso and Rebecca Brown, and I'd recommend those writers or Switch over this book."
4,Better than expected,"I bought this for my three year old who is getting into animals, and loved her plastic bag set(the little ones with green sheep you get at the pharmacey;))This is those bags' big brother! They are much, much bigger than I expected, touch big for a three year old, perfect for kids up to say ten. They are very detailed, and pretty durable. I also bought her a Schliech (sp?)horse, and they are about the same size. They are not to scale, the pig is almost as big as the horse, but if they don't care, I don't care! Great buy, five good sized animals for ten bucks. Gonna try the other bags now!"
2,Not great,"Since most Dutch speak English, I mainly wanted this book to interpret restaurant menus. It's not very helpful, even with the separate food section. For example, one thing you see all over Amsterdam is ""broodjes."" The dictionary definition is ""roll; bun."" That's true, but when you see this in a window, they're talking about sandwiches.I'm looking for another travel dictionary!"
4,flaw--one song skipped,"These are a great collection of CDs. The Peace and Tranquility CD is very good, the songs seem to stick in my heart and really speak peace over me."
5,Delightful!,"Ms. George does it again! Handsome Devil showcases a thorughly beleaguered, completely sexy, undeniable heartthrob of a hero! Her heroine, as usual, takes no guff! And her secondary characters are hilarious. Don't miss the swearing myna bird and the not-so-humble Chinese manservant. I eagerly (and I do mean eagerly) await Ms. George's next books. I was delighted to find out she has TWO more coming this year!"
2,Not good,"I love Dorothy Garlock's books but this one just didn't make it with me. The male character wasn't nice to anyone, especially Annie Lash. The story was disjointed and at times unbelievable. Maybe the 1700's just isn't the time period for me although I did like Wild Sweet Wilderness by the same author."
5,Great Microphone,"I create training videos for my work, and a major part of that is the audio overlay. I don't have a professional studio by any means, so I was looking for something with smooth, clear audio, and had a shock mount. This item is perfect for my needs. The audio sounds fantastic. Since this is a USB mic, it was just plug and play with my computer. I don't know much about the included software as I use a professional software instead, but couldn't be happier with the mic itself."
1,Kirks Original Coco Castile Soap,I ordered this soap because I read it worked well with hard water. It doesn't smell very good and it leaves your skin extremely dry. I didn't like it at all.
2,This shouldn't have been a single,"Ian Brown always seems to choose the wrong songs to release as singles and at the wrong time. On Unfinished Monkey Business instead of releasing Corpses, Can't See Me then Ice Cold Cube or What Happened To Ya he released My Star, Corpses then Can't See Me. Then on his second solo album, Golden Greats, he released Love Like a Fountain, Dolphins Were Monkeys and finally Golden Gaze, when Golden Gaze is possibly the worst choice for a single on the album. So Many Soldiers, Gettin' High, Set My Baby Free or even First World would have been far better choices.After receiving huge critical acclaim for doing an excellent cover version of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean for the single Dolphins Were Monkeys, he covers Thriller on this CD and even as a Ian Brown fan I must admit that it is poor. The single is certainly not worth spending $ on."
4,Aww! SO Cute!,"This playhouse is sooo cute! Little kids have bundles of fun too, and it's really simple to set up. Unfortunately, the doors come off pretty easily, but they snap on just as easily. And, you can carry it around without the stuff falling out the door. I would say it's worth it!"
1,Mine exploded too,"The first review notes that there oven's glass door exploded. The same thing just happened to me. I was preheating the oven to broil something and there was literally an explosion with the glass door breaking and bits of glass blown over 12 feet to the other side of the room.Black and Decker sent me a much more expensive model as a replacement but actually it is bigger than I wanted. Unfortunately they didn't have any white models available other than the exploding unit or the one they sent me.I reported the incident to the Consumer Product Safety Commision. Clearly there was a batch with problems as I got mine arount Feb. 06, apparently close to the same time the other reviewer had their problem."
1,Beware of Insignia,"This player has a 90 day warranty. It quit working on day 99. Probably used less than 50 hours. No option to fix it. No suggestions from customer service to troubleshoot it. Just ""sorry, I can't help you if you didn't buy the extended warranty."" My guess is their only option is to replace it. I wonder 'if' you had the warranty and got another one, would they replace the second one,or would you need 'another warranty'. Or more likely, would it be a one time only option. I would never buy anything else with that name. The Best Buy salesperson strongly recommended it! It was about the highest priced portable dvd they had!"
1,CHEAP!!!,I bought this product about 2 years ago and it has been nothing but trouble. A year ago the buttons on the player and remote (except for skip chapter) stoped working. After multiple requests to Insignia asking for help I was ignored. Now about 2 weeks ago the AC cord started splitting and again asked multiple times where to find a replacement and was ignored. The player is cheaply made and customer service is horrid. I'd of rather e-mail me back saying they can't help then to ignore me.
1,would not recommend,"I have yet to find a luggage lock that is any good. I thought these were going to be ok. The only good thing is they might discourage rummaging thru suitcases. One lock fell apart putting it on the suitcase. Once on, good luck getting the key to unlock. You just have to keep trying til it unlocks."
4,My Opinion,This is a great book for women to learn to get ahead in the world. These nine senators are an inspiration to any woman trying to make it in a male dominated work force.
5,highly watchable,"A wonderfull DVD, enjoyable , amazing subject matter. anyone who wondered about anything should watch this."
2,This one is hard to rate.,"This film has a lot of good solid science in it. But it also has more than its share of nutty pseudo science.Give it 2 stars.If you are interested in a film of this type, I`d recommend ""How The Earth Was Made""."
1,"The format on the box says 1080i, not 1080p","The Blue-Ray box that ""Earth: The Biography"" came in says the format is 1080i, not 1080p.Every BBC Blue-Ray and HD disk I have previously ordered has been 1080p. I also ordered ""Wild China"" in Blue-Ray at the same time and it is also labeled 1080i.It gets worse if you read the comments from ""The Blue Ray Expert""."
2,Earth: The Biography Myth,"This would have received 5 stars. The photography, animations & presentation were masterfully done. Too bad that it had to be ruined by intertwining the ""Global Warming"" hoax throughout the series. As soon as the whining rants began I had to shut it off. But, the photography was so beautifully done that I had to finish watching it and endure the lies that were being spewed out.What a pure waste of fine photography & film making."
3,So far so good,What to say about brake pads? No major problems yet will revise if they wear to quickly.
2,"Very dissappointed, for the beginner only!","I was looking for a good workout with some nice traditional belly dance moves. This video seems to be directed more for the beginner, and the routine is not very demanding or invigorating at all. The whole tape was just a warm up, stretching and cool down event. I didn't find anything demanding or anything that could be described as a ""workout."" But good if you just want very slow stretching and some meditative cool down with some basic belly dance moves in between, then this may be for you. But there are much better tapes out there, i.e. Dolphina and Neena and Veena for fitness and fun or Fat Chance Belly dance for true tribal dance."
4,Great Shoes!,"These shoes ran a half size small for me. I am normally an 8 1/2, ordered them and they were too small. I exchanged them for a 9 and they fit perfect. They are very comfortable to climb in, however the top of the shoe where the black is glued to the purple is already coming unglued after only climbing about three times in them. But other than that they are a great shoe for the price!"
2,Overpriced replacement part,The replacement worked fine and the annoying beeping stopped but it is way overpriced. Why does the battery cost almost as much as I paid for the UPS?
2,Replacement Battery for UPS,"Purchased this battery when my UPS refused to function due to battery light/alarm. Put in the new battery, let it charge for 24 hours and put the UPS back in use. It lasted about 6 weeks! Now the UPS is worthless again. Don't know if it is the battery, or the UPS itself. Just letting everyone know it is probably better to just buy a new UPS than to replace the battery. The replacement battery is about half the price of a new UPS. The original UPS battery lasted about 18 months. I guess I'll learn to live without a UPS as this 18 month cycle is ludicrous..."
3,Where are the really boney bones?,I had hoped that there would be more recipes featuring interesting and devious use of bones in cooking. What I get instead are: ribs.... The most interesting recipe was lifted from (and credited to) Fergus Henderson. Ah well.
3,A Disappointing Read,"I expected more research, more history, and better writing from a book this lovely and celebrated. It has a lot of pretty pictures, but the writing is amateurish and the recipes jump all over the place, without much context or history. You will read what the author feels about the dishes. You will not read about the evolution or background of the dishes--nor about the fascinating topic of how bone cooking shaped human history and prehistory. This book is not bad, but not satisfying. I was hoping for more than a bare-bones introduction to this meaty topic."
2,Can give children wrong impression,"I read this book at least six times between the ages of seven and eleven. It is interesting, humorous, and an unique approach to telling the life of Benjamin Franklin. The problem, however, is that Amos takes credit for most of Franklin's inventions and sayings, while portraying Franklin as a bumbling, conceited idiot. At the time when I read it, I believed the mouse part to be true, and even after I knew better, the negative portrayal of Franklin stuck in my mind. It took me several years to be able to actually like and respect him, instead of laughing at every positive portrayal of the man."
3,A Great Book,"Have you ever been friend to a mouse? In Ben and Me a mouse named Amos is forced to leave home and live with Ben Franklin.I liked this book and thought that it was very funny. It was also exciting during the mouse wars. An example of were it was funny was during the eletiscity expererment(zap). It was also funny during the mouse wars.I think that young readers everywhere should read Ben and Me if they want laughter, excitment and to know something about Ben Franklin."
5,Good Book,Ben and Me is a good book for the beginning reader. It also goes into some of the achievements of Ben Franklin. The humor in this book would delight all readers.
2,Not really history,"Ben and me is written in first person as though written by a mouse named Amos, who claims to have been the guiding influence or intelligence behind each of Benjamin Franklin's inventions. If that had been true, I'm sure old Ben would have built an awesome mousetrap and eliminated the pest.Robert Lawson is a good writer, and I have thoroughly enjoyed some of his books. This book, though, has a main character that I just found annoying. I would have tossed that mouse overboard, if I'd been Ben Franklin.Would a 3rd or 4th grader read this? They might try. I don't know if any of them would finish it. Give them The Mouse and the Motorcycle by Beverly Cleary instead."
3,Workable Problems,"Only use mine for reading-discarded all other programming. And ABSOLUTELY great to carry in purse (w/ extra batteries).--However, when changing batteries, must wait for at least a minute for the unit to recognize new batteries. Or pragramming wiped.--The largest MMC is 64MB, only get from Ectaco. Specialty item.--When the chip gets to be 50% full, might notice connection problems when the MMC is in the unit. 10 minute wait turns to 30 min., then to an hour, or never, all the time eating up battery power. Guide book says to load anything on MMC, must be in unit (found a way around that).All it needs is A/C adaptor & much bigger MMC."
2,Software is no longer supported by Mobipocket,"I was given the Ebookman 900 for Christmas, 2008. After 6 months, it quit on me. I emailed Franklin and was informed that Extacto was their distibutor. When I contacted Extacto, I was offered an upgrade to EBM 911 for an additional 85.00 which I paid. I received the new reader and everything was fine until September,2009 when I tried to download 2 titles. After contacting Mobipocket and another website where I purchase ebooks, I was told that Ebookman 911 was no longer supported by this software. Not only am I out the price of a reader that didn't last 6 months for either one, but I am out the price of the ebooks. I will not be purchasing a reader from this company again."
1,Don't drop your Ebookman,"I received my EBM-911 last week and think it's not a bad deal for the price. But this morming it fell off my desk, about 2.5 feet, and now I think the thing is toast. The screen just flashes on and off, and I can't do anything with it. Surely a hand held unit should be able to withstand more than a fall off a desk."
3,Less than advertised,"I wish that I had waited to buy this item until a review was available. The eBookman 911 is not what I expected from the pre-release hype. The backlighting is very poor and the unit depletes batteries just laying on the desk. I keep mine plugged in all the time now so I do not lose data. That said, however, the size is perfect since I have carpal-tunnel and can't support a lot of weight with my hands. The PDA functions are comparable with my Palm IIIc and easy to use.If you are looking to buy this model, find some way to try it out first."
3,just so-so,"Not the quality i would expect from a company as well known as Cuisinart, they are cheaply made molded plastic. They work just fine but i think i should have visited the dollar store of local grocery store and got the same thing cheaper."
5,Herb & Dorothy,"This is one of my favorite films on the topic of art. You get a chance to see so many sides to the art world. The creation, collecting, events, etc. Herb & Dorothy are an amazing couple! A true work of art on this DVD!"
3,Couldn't Print.... they should include templates and printing instructions,"There has to be a better way for people lime me to get things like this done.Maybe there should be an option to get the disk for the template... I really had a hard time finding the correct one and getting it to finally work.The labels are just fine, I am just commenting on the fact that if you are just like me and don't know your way around a computer, don't expect to just stick the labels in the printer and be done, it took me a few hours just to set it up."
3,Coulda been better,"Mariah Carey is a SUPERB singer.Her body of work is stellar.These days she wants to act,and there's nothing wrong with that...if you can act.Right now she can't.Maybe somewhere in the future she'll throw down on an acting job ,but for right now...Anyway,the actual movie is quite decent.Mira Sorvino and the other lady make due.Mariah tends to overact slightly,but it's more watchable than ""Glitter"" was.It's an O.K. movie but it could have been a little more believable.The plot is like that of a very mediocre Sorpranos episode and I won't give any more of that away.I still can't figure out why Cinemax showed it BEFORE it came out on DVD?!! Was it a marketing ploy? I thought a movie had to be out on video for about a year before cable got it."
1,very lame and wannabe gangster,never in a million years did I think this movie would be about mobs and things like that. But then again mariah tries to have street credibility in her music so it's no surprise she tries to do that in movies as well. Avoid at all costs and check out one of mira's better films
3,Not as Described,Ordered the Calvin Klein women's low rise flare cords and received Calvin Kline junior slim fit cords. They still fit but it is a different fit than the CK women's low rise flare cords that I also own. If I had known they would be juniors I would not have ordered them.
3,fire opals?,"i purchased this because ""white opals"" was in the description. when I got it, it was more like fire opals, yellow in color so I returned it. I have one like it already. Its okay, sturdy and has no broken or missing stones but I really wanted white opals and silver speck dos'nt carry any. The return went smoothly so all in all I'm satisfied. There were no problems with shipping. The package was not bulky. If you want fire opals this is right for you, if not I would pass"
5,Real Stereo,Product is great! Sound quality is OK for the price. I was not satisfied with the bluetooth headset i got (Nokia BH200). this is much clearer than the bluetooth. Only negative is the lines could be messy.
3,Turkey Cannon,"Great product! On my first attempt to use it I roasted a chicken. Flavor was fantastic and extremely juicey. My grill is a standard two burner, propane gas grill. I could barley close the lid. The only way I could forsee doing a turkey would be in a standard oven or by removing the cooking grate. I will try this but I fear flare ups may be a problem. You need a grill with a lot of room between the top of the lid and the cooking grate."
4,FIRST AS A LEADER,This is Jackie's first session under his name. It was recorded Oct.1955 on Ad-Lib records. The 2'nd pressing came out a few years later on the Jubilee label. The rest of the group consists of Donald Byrd on trumpet and a rhythm section led by Mal Waldron. Jack and Don were no strangers. They had just come off a gig at the Cafe Bohemia where they recorded live under pianist George Wallington's name LIVE AT THE CAFE BOHEMIA. They would record again under Jack's name within a few months LIGHTS OUT for Prestige.--As for the session at hand it is typical hard bop as we see it now but must have been a pretty bold session for it's day. Only THE ART BLAKEY QUINTET AT BIRDLAND with Clifford Brown and Lou Donaldson seemed to be in it's class at the time.-- Blue Doll is a slow blues with Donald taking a open horn solo as opposed to his muted statement on the later Lights Out. Lover Man is played by Jack and the rhythm section only.
4,Great product,"These are great. They are very durable and easy to use. The metal links are really strong and make the lock very versital. It would take someone a really long time to cut through them or the cuffs. They are kinda heavy if you have to carry them (if you don't have the mount to put them on your bike frame while you ride). It comes with a warranty for the bike for which you intend to use it. But registering with Master Lock requires a receipt or appraisal of the bike, registration number of the bike (you have to register your bike with a 3rd party like the National Bike Registry), bike serial number and description, your insurance info if any, the receipt for the lock, and the proof of purchase barcode off of the lock packaging. That part was a pain, but I did it anyway just in case someone does manage to cut these things and take off with my bike."
5,great lock,"Heavy, but does the job~It is heavy in my backpack; however, necessary.bought as a gift my boyfriend loves it."
5,A++,"Was hesitant to get the cuff-lock because it was different. Decided to give it a try, especially because of reading reviews and the price. They are extremely heavy duty, and heavy. Several ways to lock up your bicycle or multiple bikes. Very versatile. A++"
2,"This is very, very disappointing","I liked the book when I bought it, but then I read, in mid-2000, that Peterson's had been selling advertising in the book, that looked just like editorial material. In other words, many of those lovely write-ups on schools were written by the schools themselves. Peterson's said they will identified the paid ads in future editions, but their credibility is really shot with this kind of behavior, and I'm really disappointed."
5,awesome episodes,this is the third disc to season 2 part 1. this disc contains the first couple episodes from season 3. this is an awesome collection of episodes. if you have not seen season thre then i recommend you do
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book intending to dislpay it near my vintage stereo system that features a pair of Klipsch La Scala speakers. That will not be happening. This book is amateurishly written and poorly edited. Stories are told and then repeated again at length only pages later. The authors set up each chapter by describing some virtuous attribute of this man they so obviously adore and then proceed to describe someone quite the opposite (for example, they report that the ""extremely open minded"" Mr. Klipsch impulsively ripped the radio out of his car to avoid listening to music that was not to his tastes). Remove the ""filler"" - pages of patent specifications, pictures, lists of awards - and there remains precious little content, far less than one would expect in summarizing the life of such a legendary personality."
3,Comfortable but noisy,The shoes make noise when I walk. The noise is quite obvious in a quiet office environment.
1,yawn,"This had to have been Liz's last 'glamour' role. To be honest, I expected full-blown schlock and that's what I got. All I could focus on throughout the movie was how the camera was trying to camouflage this once great beauty's girth and double chin! Hellen Mirren's Karen Stone (in Willaims' ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"") is a much more authentic, and moving, portrayal of the consequences of the ravages of time - for a former stage&screen beauty and, indeed, for any of us. Best part of the movie for me was the flash of Mark Harmon's pretty butt - but my, what bushy eyebrows! ps - Fuggettabout Princess del Lago: Whatever happened to ""Sexiest Man of the Year"" Mark Harmon?! Therein, I suppose, lies Williams' not-so-surprising message..."
2,so-so,"whn Mark Harmon is the best thing in a movie, i think that says a lot, as Taylor seems to be going through the motions, zaftig in a caftan, kind of seems like her marriage to John Warner. Rip Torn, as per his name, tears up the scenery and Valerie Perrine has a most unfortunate hairdo as the town slut. there seems to be a young Annette Bening getting an impromptu massage from Harmon which was fun to watch, she even overacted that. Mostly it seems a TV movie on DVD so expect not too much. I watched it before i saw Diane Lane in the play and glad i did."
4,Great movie,"Two beautiful people on one screen... Elizabeth is definitely very classy in this film and Mark harmon has a tough time reaching her caliber. But it is a great story and well written. What do you expect, it's Tennessee Williams."
2,Artificial Life for Dummies,"If you want a non-technical, easy to read introduction to artificial life, then this book is for you. But, if you know anything about programming, then you will be disapointed. It has not a single line of code in the entire book, and is short on detail on exactly how things work. Stephen Levy did it better years ago with 'Artificial Life'. The only thing better about 'Virtual Organisms' is that it covers a few things that have happened since Levy. If Levy were to write a new edition including the new material, then this book would be totally superfluous for serious readers."
5,Excellent trading reference book,"Very few trading text have intelligent instruction on Elliott wave, fib price target projections, Indicators analysis, Tradestation programming, trading band methodology, trading plans, and trading systems all in one text. There is something there for all discipline levels and has much of what is needed in any real trading system except the customized methods each individual trader feels comfortable with. The author was very gracious with valid information, and this is a valuable reference book."
2,pele is still king you fools,pele will always continue tobe the true master&king of soccer not maradona
2,Bad DVD,I bought this DVD because i wanted Desertion of the Dinobots Part 1 and part 2. What i got was faults advertizment. When i went to play it in My dvd player. it would only play Desertion of the Dinobots Part 2 not part 1. I was very unhappy. it said that Desertion of the Dinobots Part 1 was on it. but wouldn't work or was missing. and after playing in 2 dvd players 1 in my computer and the other one stand alone. I got my money back.I Did see the others movies playied fine. but was very unhappy. i like how they made prime transform. that was really cool.if any one Of you people who sees this reviews. please Watch out.
1,"Absolute and Complete Garbage, I threw it away!!",Being a teacher of JavaScript I can say this is the most incomplete piece of garbage I've laid my eyes on.
1,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"This book does not display a easy to follow explanation of the language. It breaks it up, without any thorough explanation of each section.I would not recommend this book for beginners."
3,Skiming over complicated topics hurts book,"Having a 4-year background in C++, I was able to use this book to do some nice JavaScript programming. But, without my C++ knowledge this book would have been useless to me. The book skims over too many topics too fast. Right now I use it as a reference, when I need look something real quick. If you are looking for a step by step JavaScript tutorial this isn't it."
5,awesome book!,i read this book for a book report. the sales lady at borders recomended it. i thought it sounded good just buy the discription she gave me which was really short. i HIGHLY recomend this book to readers of various ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Starter Kit,"This is a great starter kit for people who are just starting out with the wonderful world of Yoga. I found the mat was the best part of the kit. Because of the lines on it, I found it extremely easy to make sure my body was in the correct alignment for each pose.I gave this only 4 stars because the DVD leaves something to be desired. Granted, the instructional part of the DVD was helpful - it really went into detail about how to do each move, but the workout itself was disappointing. The workout is 45 minutes but could have been done in 25. It kept repeating the same movements over and over again. Do I really need to do Downward Dog 15 times in one workout?I also found that you don't seem to need two blocks. One is sufficient.It would have been wonderful if they had included a wall chart to show each basic Yoga pose."
2,Darlene sings gospel,"Fans of Darlene and her work with Phil Spector will be very disappointed with this album.It lacks her usual fire, and the tracks seem very samey and tuneless.Her voice comes across as if she is bored with the whole thing, anfd it really needs some uptempo material.This isn't going to win her new fans I am afraid, and even fans like myself will be let down after such a long wait for her releases"
4,BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE BATTLE,"THE FILM TRIES TO PRESENT A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. WHILE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS LACKING, DON'T FORGET PEOPLE THAT THE REASON YOU'RE WATCHING THIS FILM IS FOR THE AERIAL SEQUENCES; THE FILM DELIVERS ON THIS VERY WELL. SO WHAT IF THE EFFECTS ARE NOT UP TO TODAY'S STANDARDS. CONSIDERING WHAT THEY HAD TO WORK WITH BACK THEN, THE FILM SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY AVIATION COLLECTION. THE WAY THE FINAL DOGFIGHT SEQUENCE WAS ORCHESTRATED WITH MINIMAL USE OF DIALOGUE WAS AWESOME. CLOSING THE SCENE WITH THE GERMANS' AT DINNER EMPHASIZED THE LOSSES TAKEN BY THE LUFTWAFFE AIRCREWS."
4,"Great Album, but slightly lacking","White Trash Hell starts off with a fairly lame version of Herion Girl, but from there things start to pick up. Pacific Wonderland is an extremely good instrumantal, which is followed by two good old-style Everclear tracks. 1979 follows, but lets down the abum slightly, although the next track (for pete's sake) more than makes up for it, and I wonder why it was never put on a main album. The accoustic Fire Maple Song is probably the best version I ever heard. Overall the album is another classic Everclear album (with a couple of minor faults) with Art's usual 5-star lyrics keeping the listener mixed up in their emotions all the way through."
5,Simple to read and understand,"As a patient who received a kidney transplant few years ago in India, I found a lot of useful information. I think it will help me understand the psychological issues better."
4,Interesting Story Line,"I Liked this book alot better than the other 4 books I have read by Ms. Mallory. This one made sense and connected all of the characters in the story line. In her other books she dropped the story line and was quite repetative in what she wrote thur out the books, But she got it right with the Viscounts Wicket Ways! Interesting story of inventions being made labortories and spys trying to steal new inventions being developed put that with romance and you get a very good story to read. Finally for me she has redeemed herself!"
4,Crime Scene Investigations,This is a great book with activities to teach young children about forensic science. This summer I will be teaching fourth graders about finger and lip printings to help solve a false crime scene.
5,One of the best live albums ever,the godz rip and roar through this album. all the classics perfomedas tight as possible. they breathe new life in to the great songs.i found a copy awhile back on ebay and just picked up another one for a good friend of mine. he is japanese and has never heard of the godz. i was lucky to have seen them a few times back in the day. KILLER BAND !!!!!! should have been much bigger than they were.
2,Quiet drives with loud fans,"Our studio has around 6 of these drives (various capacities). The ""Pro Audio"" designation must be a joke; you can hear their fans whining and rattling from several rooms away. I opened up a couple and found near-silent Samsung hard drives in them, wasted by poor quality fans in the enclosures.We use these drives to make backup copies of finished sessions to sit on the shelf. They are too noisy for daily use."
2,not as shown in pirectu,in real life this cable is a lot bigger than you imagine from the picture. i go to stonybrook university which seems to be a thieves headquarters and wanted to take it with my while i ride and use it to secure my tires. this is too huge to take with you. seems like something you would use if you lock your bike up outside for a week instead of daily usage. if it were thinner or lighter i would like it more. it is high quality and the ropes are able to go inside each other so you have a noose incase you want to secure it to a bar further away.
1,Doesn't work stable,"I bought this Hub and it doesn't work consistantly -- sometimes good, sometimes bad. Finally after a week it doesn't get recognized by the computer any more -- it's ""Unknown Device"". All other USB products works fine on my computer. This product is no good and don't waste your money and energy on it."
2,Good only for B2C dot com managers.,"Although the book description promises a book for 'all managers' operating in the Internet age, there really isn't much content that can be used outside of B2C web site management. Whether or not you are a technology manager, this book will be a waste of time unless you manage a B2C dot com."
2,cute.. but a tight fit,"I've got bigger feet (10.5 women's) and these socks stretch but are still a bit pulling on my toes. After a few hours of wearing them, my toes began to ache as if my shoes were too small and pushing on my nails... the socks were constantly pushing in on my toes/nails and eventually caused pain so that I couldn't stand it!Probably great for people with less sensitive feet or smaller feet.very cute socks."
3,Chayanne Grandes Exitos DVD,"Great product, however, the videos span through his whole career. Some of the videos are very poor quality from the 80s."
3,Light Historical Fiction,"There are some clever references to Elizabethan historical figures, but an otherwise forgettable novel. The first person narrative, told exclusively from Christopher Marlowe's perspective, limits the scope of the novel. While the main protagonist is somewhat likable, the plot and time constraints do little to explore his character more sufficiently."
3,Not as good as De Nova,Didn't get into this as much as the previous album. Still worth picking up if you're a fan of the band. Some of the alternate versions of the songs off De Nova are interesting but I was hoping for more fresh material.
5,Incredible,"This band is an example of talented young artists. Not only is the music spectacularly written the vocals, guitars, and drums are amazing. I don't know about the drums on the Redwalls debut album, Universal Blues, but the new drummer, Ben Greeno is one of the most spectacluar musicians I have ever heard. Not only is he a wonderful addition to an already talented band, he has added more excitement to the music. I would go to their website and check out upcoming shows to see the band at work."
5,See them live,"I saw these guys live in the Twin Cities last week. They opened for Keane and The Zutons. These guys were definitely the best part of the show. They had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun. To top it off, they sounded great and their songs were well written. Give these guys a shot, unless you hate Rock 'n' Roll!!!"
3,Don't waste you time....,"This movie was a major disappointment. Besides an awesome scene taking place in an S & M nightclub, ............ If you want to see a nice set ...., and star Meilani Paul has'em, then pick this up. Otherwise, I would recommend a nice Barney video."
1,"Degrading, Racist Movie!","Aside from the fact this movie is completelty unorigional, it's the most racist movie I've seen in a while. Just another White fantasy, save the exotic submissive Asian female from her oppressive culture and evil sexist Asian men. The White knight introduces to the obedient AF a new Western way of living and they fall in ""love""If you are a Asiaphile who can't get dates other than Asian women or if you are a self hating Asian female who feels welcomed and accepted by the White mainstream when a former takes you into his hairy arms, this movie is for you..."
1,Negative Five Stars,"If you enjoy films that stereotype an entire race of people, then go ahead and blow your $13.48 on this P.O.S. And if you enjoyed this film, may I suggest other timeless ""classics"" like: ""16-Candles"" ""Karate Kid II"" and ""Charlie's Angels 2.""Otherwise, hold onto your money and use it for something more meaningful and life-enriching. How about a film that that doesn't portray minorities in a negative light?"
1,Asiaphiles' Favorite,"I saw this movie, it blows! Like any other racist movie, this one sux as well. The Asian woman has identity issues, and the Steven Dunning is your typical Asianphile. Look it up if you don't know what ""Asianphile"" means."
1,Wow... Such an original plot....,"A poor, defenseless Chinese woman immigrates to L.A.'s Chinatown to seek a better life, but faces oppression from those around her (Asian Americans), until she is ""rescued"" by her (white) ""knight in shining armor.""If you enjoy movies which stereotype an entire group of people, then you should buy this.<sarcasm>"
1,A waste of time.,"This movie has insulted my intellgence. The drama is played out in a manner that is both sluggish, dull, and apathetic. The charcter portrayals suffer from lack of development, and the racial overtones are intensely insulting. Don' waste your time with this movie."
5,"They work, what more do you want.",I bought these to work on/adjust my new Benchmade knife. They are exactly as described and did exactly what I needed them to do. I was using the smallest wrench and it didn't warp/bend or strip so it seems like a good tool as far as I'm concerned and much cheaper than the Benchmade set (I love Benchmade but come-on!!).
5,Fantastic!,"Marty Goetz has created another collection of Messianic songs of worship for Christmas! This Cd is fantastic. My other favorite CD is ""He Is My Defense"". I really enjoy the addition of Hebrew with the English...even my Junior High schoolers loved this music, once they got used to it!!"
4,"It works, but can interact with prescription drugs","I thought people should know that, if taken the regular 3-4 times a day, it can interact with blood pressure drugs, like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers and raise blood pressure....it sure did me and some other weird effects (I prob took too much)I am just certain that many---like me--think it is a harmless herb and it can be not so"
4,Would give five stars if Lynott's own words were used.,"Well researched, and importantly it does not rely on ""A friend of a friend"" or ""Insiders said"" quotes. All quotes are attributed, but I wish the author would have infused the book with more quotes and statements by Phil from media interviews of the period. Perhaps, he did not want the subject clouded by his view of himself? A great introduction to Lynott, that would be rounded out by a reading of Philomena Lynott's 'My Boy' book. I thought the most insight on the great and moody side of Lynott was given by Jim Fitzpatrick (who did many of Lizzy's album covers), and on the whole every member of the Lizzy cast was contacted and quoted in the book. Huey Lewis in particular came of in a great light. Also a great resource for those interested in early Irish rock music, and the bands which formed and quickly faded but had a lasting impact as proving grounds for future success. A good read on a great artist."
5,"A ""Must Have"" Reference for Patients and Doctors.","The editors and authors of this HealthNotes publication have presented the most up-to-date information in an easy to read format without compromising scientific judgement. In the information world of alternative medicine, it is all to easy for conventional medical texts to react out of fear by recommending ""extreme caution"" for just about any prescription or possible nutrient/herbal interaction. ""The A-Z Guide..."" does a tremendous job of integrating insights of physicians form several different disciplines (the book is written by an MD, ND, and DC, et. al.), which provides the reader with a diverse and thorough scientific review of known and suspected interactions. I have personally found this book extremely helpful in the waiting room and on my desk as a quick refernce."
4,Straightforward and Comprehensive,"The book is large but set out in a series of straightforward sections: the first one on drugs themselves (under generic names - useful if you're British !) with each entry having a general paragraph on the drug (or group of drugs) but then goes onto talk of how it/they interact with herbs and vitamins whether helpful and unhelpful interactions.There is then a large section on the vitamin, mineral or herbal supplements simply showing which drugs they interact with. The final two sections appear to be for medical professionals only as one is listing the drugs by pharmacist classification and one is a 'book/article source listing' giving the medical sources about each of the drugs.I'd never realised it wasn't a good idea to take a codeine pain killer compound with tea before - the tannins inhibit the uptake of the drug ! Very interesting."
4,Powerful Desk Top Reference,"When working with people on medications, this serves as an excelelnt resource tool. Claudia Newcorn - author of the award-winning fantasy, CrossoverCrossover: Krisálys Chronicles of Féyree"
3,Base is low quality,"The unit itself is constructed well, but the ergonomic base (the part that fits into your palm) is of such poor quality that the rubberized coating began to flake away just a few weeks after I received it. This is not the case for my Gripmaster, which I have had for many years. Fortunately, I can take the cover off the the GM and put it on this one, but I shouldn't have to do that."
3,Good but miss some elementary exploded views,Good book but miss some elementary exploded views for newbees. Could be more oriented for everyday use. Missing some details about the cables etc.
4,Rising Water,"Rising Water was a really good book!!! I would suggest that you read it and trust me, i know it is a little boring in the beggining but it gets good afterr that!"
2,Pour Quality,"The spouts are larger, than any used previously, making it hard to control pour quantity. Being used for olive oil and vineager, they are not going to last and will have to be replaced."
1,Don't Bother!,"I wouldn't recommend this boot dryer to anyone..I bought it thinking it would be a great Christmas gift, and turns out that all it does is blow cold air so lightly that it would take hours and hours to dry anything. It won't even dry gloves never mind boots. Better off paying the extra $10 for a real one or just using a hair dryer. Total waste of money!"
1,Terrible Product,This product blows cold air. It does not dry at all. I do not recommend this product. Pay the extra money and get a good one!
4,Very Good,I bought this as a gift for my son. He needed something to dry his work boots and this item does the trick
1,No power cord ??!!!,"I dont know if the dryer works yet. How ever I can tell you that it comes with a place to plug in a power adapter ""But they dont send you one""so you must purchase one some place else or use it with ""D"" battery's.This disappointed us a great deal!"
2,ok,a bit obnoxious...tells you what every rts/t game _has_ to have and how great he and his code is.Some extremely biased opinions. Doesn't explain the tons of code in detail. Not for the inexperienced programmer at all. Puny puny cd...just the code...no game examples...nothing on how to pull it all together to create a game.
2,Examples Don't work,All of the code offered in the book will not compile with MSC++ 6.0 Further the problems with the code is with the DirectX part of the code. My advice is don't buy this book.
1,poor approach,"this book takes a poor approach, jumps around topics like crazy, and never gets into the meat of the code, especially the multiplayer aspect of the game.. which, in my opinion, is what makes a RTS playable.."
5,Love this brush......,"I had an Oral B for years, it finally died, and I replaced it with a Sonic, that I had been told was ""better"" than the Oral B. Well, I tried to get used to the Sonic, which is what I was also told I'd have to do........but I never did. When this was on a special deal I ordered it and am once again happy with my toothbrush. Having tried both I can recommend the Oral B, the Sonic is something else again.............."
5,Gift for my wife - she loves it!,"Seems well made, nice timing features and my wife says her mouth feels 'fresher' after using this product instead of a regular toothbrush. This came recommended by our dentist."
5,Great!!,"I can't believe anyone would rate this system lower than 5 stars! The round head is much better than that of Sonicares ""traditional"" head, AND it's much easier to keep clean...Basically its 0 up-keep as where the Sonicare requires attention due to a poor design. Go ahead.... buy this sytem, and enjoy!"
5,A revealing anthology of personal memoirs,"Expertly co-edited by Faith Eidse and Nina Sichel, Unrooted Childhoods: Memoirs Of Growing Up Global is a revealing anthology of personal memoirs drawn from a wide variety of authors, each of whom focus upon the experience of growing up without being able to ""put down roots"" of belonging. Many of these thoughtful and thought-provoking essays are published here for the first time. They reflect the link between language and cultural identity, as well as the framing the travails of adolescence in North America, South America, and Africa, offering the reader a impressive collection of uniquely human voices identifying the dehumanizing cultural homogenization that globalization tends to unilaterally spread. Unrooted Childhoods is a seminal and highly recommended contribution to contemporary sociology, cultural history, social issues, and autobiography reading lists."
2,Nothing new for real fans,"This is a good book for part-time Laker fans. They get to learn a lot about locker room stories.But if you're someone who regularly follow the Lakers'exploits during the season, on the internet or otherwise, you're not getting any wiser by reading this book. The author was just repeating articles form the LA Times, OCR and other sources. Reading passages in the book you get the feeling that you've already read that somewhere else.This ain't a David Halberstram book."
1,Why do they have to destroy everything beautiful?,"How do I accurately describe this album? It's like the music industry jumped up on my stereo, bent down, and squeezed a warm stinking turd for us all to smell.The soft beauty and grace that Brokeback's original score worked so hard to achieve is absolutely pummeled to death by this filth. I don't even think clubbers will enjoy this, I mean exactly how does one ""remix"" country music? The melody is twisted and bent into the timing of the beats and sounds completely wrong. Save your money for the original, or if you have to buy club music, get something (ANYTHING) else."
2,Not all that.,"This ""remix"" is alright, nothing special just the same song played over and over and over. Quality was good, like most things ordered from amazon."
1,I WAS CHEATED,"THE LIGHTED MAGNIFIER ARRIVED WITH DEAD LEAKY BATTERIES. THE LIGHT SWITCH DID NOT WORK BECAUSE OF DAMAGE FROM BATTERY ACID. BECAUSE I CONSTRUCT ELECTRONIC DEVICES AS A HOBBY, I PURCHASED A BATTERY HOLDER, MINIATURE TOGGLE SWITCH AND MINIATURE LAMP SOCKET AND CONSTRUCTED A NEW LIGHT ASSEMBLY. THIS ADDED TO MY EXPENSE."
5,Cyber Love's- Illusions MUST READ!!!!!,This is a must read for internet online dating men and women- the information in this book will make you educated and be able to know when you have come upon a scammer.
1,STAN,"I ORDERED A UNIT FOR A 300 HUMMINBIRD AND WHAT I GOT WAS FOR A 700 HUMMINBIRD FISHFINDER ALTHOUGH I DID OPEN IT SO I COULD CHECK THE UNIT FOR MY INSTALLATIO, SO WHEN IT'S OPEN YOU CAN'T RETURN WITHOUT A RESTOCKING CHARGE."
4,the same one?,"hm. riley...roberts?gray house? youth and government? comittee 2?! now i am really astounded. having written a book while still in high school? amazing....that is, if it is the same person."
2,"Horatio Hornblower, anyone?","When I first saw this book I thought, Hey neat, somebody else has come up with a cool idea for a story about ships at the turn of the 19th century. But I was wrong. This book seems to me to be just an imitation of the classic Horatio Hornblower novels with one exception. The navy in this book is American and not British. I would think this is because the writer is from the US and doesn't know that much about England. Anyway, I would recommend saving yourself the trouble of reading this ... and take a look at the real deal by C. S. Forester. I would give it one star, but I like the painting on the cover."
2,What A Major Rip Off,"pricing was a total rip off, when it originally came out from the publisher they did not even charge this outragous amount, it's not as if it is an antique!"
1,Horrible,Horrible- Even the packaging promoted that two songs on the CD were Yes songs. I should have just thrown the money away . I wish Sherwood would stop promoting himself as a member of Yes. Yes fans know who the real members are . Is Chuck Leavell now a member of Yes.
1,First simulated dog game my daughter got....it stinks.,My daughter wanted this game by all means and after finally getting one she was very disappointed. She doesn't play it at all and after getting her DS for Christmas last year she much rather prefers playing Nintendogs. I can't imagine the great reviews for this product because my daughter was only about 5 or 6 when playing it and it did not hold her interest at all. She has three different Nintendogs games and enjoys all of them. Never mind the fact that she has a real dog! She prefers playing with her simulated ones! Go figure.
2,puzzle people,"This game is pretty lame if it weren't for the puzzle games included. For kids it might be fun to buy your dog stuff but it's slow and boring. The matching dogs part is addictive as well as the picture one, those two make the game worth buying but if you are a puzzle person Tetris or Dr. Mario is a better buy."
1,ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE -- DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,"The KVM switch is absolutely defective. BLACK SCREEN. NO PICTURE AT ALL.After hooking it up per instructions, the display is completely black. No image at all. The display says it is getting no video signal at all. I tested each of the two computers with each of the three cables, hooked up direct from the computer to the monitor. All six combinations (computer X cable) work perfectly without the KVM switch. The problem is definitely the KVM switch.I returned the first unit, assuming it must just be a defective unit, and got a replacement unit. The second unit exhibits exactly the same behavior. BLACK SCREEN. NO PICTURE AT ALL. I am also returning the second unit. This time, I want my money back."
2,nicely designed but poor mac support,"i was using this switch with two macs and for a while it worked fine, but after a couple of weeks it stopped recognizing the laptop. after i spoke with the support dept at startech i realized they know very little about macs. they made suggestions that simply do not apply to the mac os and insisted that they did. since then i have seen reviews of other startech products and those user agree that startech does not know the mac os very well.so i returned it to amazon and will steer clear of startech products. a shame, since the design is great. all the ports are on the back and it keeps your desktop very tidy. since then i have"
2,Seriously?,"I bought this DVD as part of a 3 dvd set with the ""Through the Eyes of a Pro"" DVDs. I have yet to watch the other two.Let me start by saying I keep up with McNally's blog. I think he is great and jumped at the chance to see his DVD. Upon watching it, I think its great to see a world renowned pro at work, but I didnt learn a single thing from this ""educational"" DVD. I was hoping from some basic set ups from McNally and maybe some of his tricks. I got a 1 hour sales promo, with a nice commentary by McNally. Frankly I would save the 20 bucks and get ""The Moment It Clicks"" or ""The Hot Shoe Diaries."""
5,I love it.,I had a few of these as a kid at different times one i got from boys life magazine when i was around 6 years old and like so many of our prized possesions like HO cars and the real train set's we got for christmas and my matchbox car collection wich are all worth a lot of money now i wish i would have kept all of that cool stuff but for the life of me i do not have a clue where it all went since i do not remember selling or giving away any of these things but now i have one back this giant lighter and it's just like the one i had so many years ago and i'm keeping this one.Like i siad i love it. Thank's.
2,Stick with ConAir,"I bought this to try a different brand as they always burn out after about 9 months. This one didn't last that long. I just can't keep hair from getting inside and one tiny strand almost sets it on fire. Not sure how they can fix that, but I can't open it enough to get the stray hairs out so I can't use it anymore. I've had it maybe 3 months."
3,Just alright,"I like they lights they work really well, just not for the ground (they don't stay in well) and when I attached them to my gate I had to use zip ties as the clip was not large enough to attach to my gate. They do work really well just a little pricey."
1,Nintendo has gotten lazy...,"I was extremely disappointed when I played this game. Save your money and buy SSX 3 because this is same game with a small graphical update, less characters, less slopes, less gear, less boards, less options exept a new type of tournament, and a higher price. They didnt even even add online play. Nintendo basically recycled and simplified and old game for more money. Shame on you Nintendo, you should know better. Please, dont let them get away with this! Buy SSX 3 instead, you'll save a lot of money.I might get downed a lot for this but its all true. Anyone who owns or has played SSX 3 would know. I own SSX 3 and Blur, and played them both throughly, so I would know.SSX 3SSX 3SSX 3"
3,SSX Blur is a fun game but I got tired of it,"The graphics are great and you really do feel like you are snowboarding. The main problem is what everyone has been saying ... it's not easy to control. I have to say the first 10 or 15 min are really cool, but then you get bored of just skiing around downhill. So, I probably didn't figure out the point of the game. Anyways, my recommendation is that you rent this game first before you decide to buy it. It's not a must have, but it's fun to try."
3,I wish I would have started a different book.,"Frustrating. Today, I finished this book after beginning it almost nine-months ago. I remember enjoying the beginning of the novel and, as such, felt compelled to finish. I enjoyed the writing but disliked the plot line and the character interactions. I imagine the movie, based on plot lines and character interactions, is a flop. Moo and Stone Diaries (Carol Shields) are better books. I may have enjoyed this more if I had considered the King Lear connections, while reading the book."
2,"Slow first half, soap opera second half","Smiley's style of writing was not anything worthy of the Pulitzer, in my opinion. The first half of the book was just barely interesting enough to keep me from putting it down. Then the entire world started breaking down around the characters, and despite my frustration with the characters I couldn't stop reading. The characters were well constructed and as complex as real people. However, there seemed to be no redemption for any of the characters after such incredible suffering. In a way, this story of family fragmentation is probably many people's nightmare. I finished the book and felt that my emotions had been manipulated in a rather unsavory way."
1,Could it get any worse?,"I had heard so many good things about this book -- passionate, forceful, compelling. Well, I hated it. Really...could we possibly get beyond the weak woman victimized by the big mean man syndrome? The characters are flat and completely without dimension or motivation. Not once does the reader get any real insight as to why the characters behave in such a ridiculous manner. Relationships deteriorate before they are explored or even developed. And what's with the prodigal son going from one sister to another? Please! How many sterotypical examples do we need of men behaving like dogs? Not to mention the woman who can only find fulfillment through motherhood. These characters need to get lives because the author certainly failed to provide."
2,A waste of time,"I can't believe that a book that won the Pulitzer Prize had such horrible editing. There is a huge mistake towards the end when the author (not surprisingly, with all of the useless details she was always talking about) can't decide if her character is vacuuming, or doing the dishes. Weird."
3,a haunting read,"this book came highly recommended and was suggested for book club.Had I known that the subject matter would leave me feeling so haunted, I would not have read this. Having read it, I am glad I did. I was surprised at how my intrest was maintained throughout the book. Good prose, had what it takes to keep me reading to the end. Perhaps ending a book feeling haunted, frustrated, and empty is mark of a good read, and therefore should have a five star rating. My giving 3 stars is based on personal prefrence."
3,dramatic story written without drama,"I didn't know the tie in with King Lear. Truth be known, I borrowed this book becase I liked the front cover. I expected a family saga, with sorrows and joys, but only found sorrows. To me it felt like there wasn't any drama, that the farm theme took all that away. Eg: shelled peas, snapped off some broccoli, decided to kill my sister, swept the floors...... etc etc. Basically quite a saga with not too many nice people and not too many see it to the end."
4,"A good portrayal of ""unfinished business""","I think the book can be enjoyed on its own merits without reference to King Lear. Maybe King Lear inspired Jane Smiley but that does not necessarily meant that she expected readers to know this or relate it all back to her source of inspiration. I think it is a very well-written & masterly book simply because it shows what unfinished business does to people, & also how people can be affected by their relationship to a particular piece of land. I enjoyed it, not just for the pleasure in reading it, also in the thought it has provoked."
2,"Who gives out those Pulitzer Prizes, anyway?","Not bad in style at first, but it gets boring fast. I simply could not get beyond page 50. Fortunately I had borrowed it and didn't actually shell out shekels for it."
1,Ho-HUMMM,I wouldn't know where to begin. I don't want to recommend this book to anyone. The narrative is tedious. The characters uninteresting. I can't imagine why anyone would pick up this novel for casual reading. It'll be time spent that you will never get back!!!!
4,enjoyable read,As a Pulitzer winner and member of the 1001 list this book has been on my tbr list for quite some time. I found the family dynamic fascinating and disturbing but also beautifully written. I still have Moo by Smiley on my shelf at home and hope that I find it as enjoyable as this one.
4,Thought Provoking,"I recently finished A Thousand Acres which I had purchased at a church book sale. I thought the descriptions of the settings and the construction of the characters was excellent. I do think that to truly understand Ginny and her reaction to her long-hidden memories as well as her insatiable desire to bear a child, one would have to have been touched by child molestation and miscarriage. Not long after I finished the book the ""made-for-TV"" movie was on and I was anxious to see how well they had done with this book. The movie does not even come close to portraying the characters as they were in the book. And, in my estimation, many scenes crucial to the story and understanding of the characters were left out. Good read. I am recommending this book to my reading club."
4,Great TV for the price...,I've had this Westinghouse for almost a year and it's been a great little TV for the price. It is definitely not a high-def panel but for normal TV and DVD viewing you can't go wrong. If this is going to be your only TV look into something a little higher-end but if you're looking for a nice smaller panel for the bedroom go for it.
1,Bad shipping,Well I should have paid attention to the other review. Can you imagine shipping a light in a plastic bag and expecting it to make it in one piece. Light looked nice if was not in pieces on arrival. I normally have good luck with Amazon stuff but I have never bought anything breakable before.
5,Been Over A Month: Works Like A Charm!,"I've recently been in the process of remodeling my room, and I decided that I wanted stuff to start ""glowing"" in the dark. Needless to say, Amazon was the first place I turned to in my search for the right black light. Upon reading the reviews for this particular size/model, I was a bit skeptical, especially when it came to those saying that the product was damaged during shipping. Fortunately, though, after I chose to order this, mine came in undamaged. I will mention, however, that one of the reviewers said a small ""rattling"" could be heard when you shake the light. Yes, this is true, but it's no big deal so there is no need to ""freak out,"" or anything if you experience this. Anyway, it's been over a month now since I bought it, and it works perfectly; not to mention its soundless (as quiet as a mouse)! I truly recommend this, despite these other reviews. At this price, it is worth the gamble, and I'm glad I chose to purchase this! :)"
1,broken on arrival,"I was really excited about getting this light for my party room but when I got the package from the post office, I heard something rattling around in the box. Sure enough, as soon as I opened the package, broken glass fell all over my floor. The light bulb had broken completely in half. Something is rolling around inside the fixture too but I can't tell if it works or not because I don't have a bulb to put in it..."
1,Dreck!,"Poorly written, poor research, poor proof-reading - the typeset isn't even consistent. The verbiage is laboriously descriptive! Booth's vocabulary is limited - at times, she used words inaccurately! The characterizations were poorly thought out and difficult to care about from my viewpoint - I could have cared less whether they lived or died. The historical detail was inaccurate. In short, if you read this book, read it aloud with friends - you will find it hysterically funny!"
4,Kubrick's Final Masterpiece disected (well),"You really need to be a big fan of Stanley Kubrick to appreciate Eyes Wide Shut (the movie or the book). It covers the movie in extraordinary detail pointing out things I hadn't seen or thought of in the many viewings I've made of Kubrick's finale. It refers frequently to the novella it's based on, Traumnovelle, and draws a lot of comparisons to the fin-de-siecle original and the end-of-the-20th century contemporary setting of the movie. Loved this book. Buy it."
2,Not up to standards,"I have enjoyed many books by Elin Hilderbrand. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them. the writing was very sophomoric...Certainly not up to her regular standard."
3,Good and Bad...,"Having worked in a restaurant throughout college, I found the restaurant parts of the book interesting. In fact, reading about the crowded restaurant stressed me out at times! It made me recall those busy nights when you thought you would never get it all done. I am curious to know, to the readers who never worked in a restaurant, was it hard to follow? That being said, the rest of the book was good and bad. I like how the relationships formed at the bistro...it was very realistic. But, relationship between Fiona and Thatcher was a little weird. The flashbacks to their childhoods were not enough to understand the depth of their relationship. Although I admire the loyalty that Thatcher and Fiona each other, it was a little ridiculous. The ending was pretty bad. It was kind of abrupt, and it had me thinking, ""now what?"""
2,Did not care much for this book,"I did not care too much for this book. The pain to get through this book was like ripping of a bandaid r-e-a-l-l-y slowly...! I don't know any other way to describe it! I stayed with it because I became vested in the characters and just HAD to see how the whole thing ended.....well, the ending in itself was just MORE painful! It just left me as the reader feeling absolutely nothing! I kept searching for more pages like I was certain I must've missed the ""real"" conclusion! I was not impressed with this author and will not read any more of her works...."
1,A dud,I've read several of this author's books. I love being transplanted to Nantucket. This book transplanted me to a restaurant on Nantucket. Didn't get the Island vibe like her other books. I picked this book for an interesting story line not the dishes the Blue Bistro served. Worst of all was the ending. It was flat and failed to bring any resolution to the various story lines. I picked this book based on the reviews. I'm wondering if I read a different novel because this one was a dud.
3,Was Not Good To The Last Drop.,"OH Boy. I remember when Goose died in Top Gun. I was horrified. Surely, this could not be happening.That's what Blue Bistro reminded me of.I've been to Nantucket and the author really captured the feel of the Island. I was transported and loving the food I read about and the people that ran the Bistro. There were many flawed characters and sometimes their problems stressed me out. I felt at times I was splitting my time between a bistro and a Doctor's waiting room.However, I couldn't put this book down (a wonderful sign) but then I got to the end and actually made sure I wasn't missing pages. I then turned the book around, as if I'd discover a different ending.I think, had I read the reviews (I bought the book used)and been warned about the ending, maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed? So, it is worth the read, just as long as you know you might not like the end."
5,"First Read of Hilderbrand's work, LOVED IT!","I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and was getting inpatient waiting for Safe Haven to come out so I went to the local big-box book store to find something to read. I don't like those Harlequin novels and I prefer uplifting stories. I've tried Jodi Picolt(her stuff is too tragic, constantly) and I loved, LOVED Kristin Hannah's Firefly Lane and True Colors -- so I was hoping Elin also had this style of writing...and I was correct. I've never been to Nantucket, but she colored it as though I had, she drew me into the characters and made me believe I was watching the movie in my head. This is a wonderful story of redemption of faith in love, the long lengths of lifetime friendships and she intertwines importance of family in this book as well. I will surely pick up another of her books after I finish Safe Haven."
4,Great story,"Ms Hilderbrand displayed a lot of knowledge of restaurant operations and that made this story very interesting to me. The plot is slightly fanciful: unfocused woman comes to enchanted island, gets a great job, meets wonderful man and straightens out her life. All that is missing is:""and lived happily ever after"""
4,amazing CD,This is a really amazing CD. The songs are all powerful and moving. I like to listen to it while jogging or just hanging out at home. The songs are great to sing along to.
3,L'AMOUR TREAT,"If Louis L'amour is on your list of western writers, you should include this book. It is well written look at the early days of So. California. The hero grows to manhood quickly as does the American influence in the area. Good read."
5,Fun AND Useful,"This is the coolest etiquette book I've ever seen! If you already know about ETIQUETTEHELL.COM, then you've got the basic idea of what this book is about - brides who went nuts trying to boss everybody around and didn't get away with it. But the kicker is in what the authors say about the stories. They hit it right on the head each time! And the ""anti-toxins"" at the end of the chapters is all anyone needs to know about surviving wedding planning. Brides won't act like they know it all and everybody else will know how to deal with a major bridezilla without encouraging the temper tantrum from hell if they follow these guidelines. This is the best thing I've ever seen that talks about ATTITUDE as well as how to handle the etiquette of various sticky situations. Every bride and groom should read this before getting too deep into wedding planning and friends of the couple should read this so they'll know in advance how to handle the Creature From Hell.Good job!!"
4,"Handy item, great price, but a little overrated","Although the marketing for these things raises our expectations a bit too high, it's still very handy for certain applications. You never have to worry about dead batteries or changing bulbs. However, you cannot store it with a charge on it, or the rechargable battery develops a ""memory"" and will not hold much of a charge thereafter. It is fantastic for stashing (fully discharged) in a car or boat or any other of those places where a conventional flashlight always has dead batteries when you need it. The only drawback is a minute or three of winding before it's recharged (not a great inconvenience when you really need light!). Some of these have a built in compass, but don't consider this a selling point. I've gotten better compasses out of boxes of cracker-jacks."
4,Good stuff to have,"This is a handy light for emergency times which never runs out of battery, cause you can charge its internal battery just by turning it's swivel."
5,Very enjoyable and inspiring doco and performances,"As a beginner bellydancer I really enjoyed the variety of moves and props used by dancers in this DVD - everything from multiple scarves, to canes, zills, and a spectacular dance with isis wings. In the intro section one of the dancers responsible for organising the project is filmed giving lessons and providing her opinions on bellydance. Interviews with the other dancers and the owner of the venue are interspersed between the improv performances, giving a real sense of what motivates and inspires the women and their supporters.The costumes, women, moves and music are beautiful and varied. The camera angles compliment the performances and the use of close ups is appropriate."
3,Damaged discs,"I recieved 4 damaged/unplayable discs, all feature films. Two didn't play and the other two were warped. I tried to flatten them with heavy books on a table for a week and this didn't work. Im in the process of what to do next. Will update the review when I get there. For now, I'm not impressed.Update: I contacted customer service and they gave me a partial refund due to the damaged disks. They were friendly and I will do business with both amazon and the seller in the future. They did what they could to make ammends, these things happen."
4,Love the series . . hate the head!,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I found the Bender head a big pain-- difficult to open & almost impossible to close securely. In fact the 2nd time I put it down, almost all of the discs went flying out & a few got scratched, though thankfully not badly. I recommend getting alternative storage. I bought a cheap CD case for the DVDs & gave the head to the kids next door. The last time I saw Bender, he was half-buried in their sandbox."
4,malcom X,"The book molcom X was a very good book. Im telling you if you havent read this book you need to check it out.The book tells you about when he was younger malcom X was in and out of jail he studed Islam. Malcom X met all kinds of people including dr.martin luther king jr. they both stood for the same thang.He met cassius clay a.k.a. muhammad ali on february 21,1965 he was shot while speaking at a rally. I recommend this book because it was realy good and its lets you and me know more abuot him and how he lived and the thing he did to make this world a better place for you and me."
1,Region 2 - Europe - don't buy it,"Don't bother trying to buy the European R2 DVD as the quality is lousy and I had to send my copy back because it wasn't even anamorphic wide-screen, but letter-box in 4:3.Let's see whether the owners of the film or their rightholders can be bothered to offer a restored version in blu-ray. I am not holding my breath."
3,Finally on DVD,"I am glad to see this movie on DVD finally - but it seems to be MONOaural and thats too bad. Have the movies been mono in 1960s ? Sad. Also, the picture doesnt seem to good...."
5,still tops in the field,"I've been using the wordprocessor component of this suite, wordpro, since it first came out as Ami pro... it was the very first wordprocessor written from the ground up for windows 3, the first pc gui word processor. It's still the best.The whole suite beats the others in every way... I've used them all, and this one remains my favorite"
1,It looks nice but doesn't last.,I chose this mini stepper becuase I thought it looked heavy-duty. I used it for a couple of months only and it broke. One of the metal pieces broke right off-there is no way to fix this-I'll have to order parts. Before it broke I decided it isn't that great of a workout (I've owned one other brand of mini stepper) this particular one does quick small steps only. I don't reccommend this product.
2,"Very noisy, jerky stiff motion","I hate using this thing. It not only makes a ton of noise, and I have sprayed it liberally in all areas using a quality dry lubricant made specifically for exercise equipment, but the motion is stiff and jerky no matter how much you adjust the knob. It also has a tendency to tip backwards if you happen to not have your feet all the way forward on the treads. I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it. I also wish I had seen these latest negative reviews before I bought and not only that I paid way more just a few weeks ago than what it costs today. Just a totally disappointing experience no matter how I look at it. Shame on companies like Fitness Quest for putting such garbage out on the market and taking people's hard earned money away from them for nothing in return. I'll be taking this along on my next Goodwill run. If I had to say anything positive about this item it would be that it looks nice and you can use it barefoot."
1,This was the most depressing movie I've ever seen!,"I first saw this movie when I was about 40 years old. Thankfully, I was watching it alone because I cried so hard at the end. Whenever I tell someone about the movie, it was so SAD that I could start crying just explaining what the movie was about. It was really good until the end and the ending was so disturbing, I would never watch it again!"
5,AWESOME Schleich Whale Shark,It looks so real & is another great Schleich toy. The quality it AWESOME. My kids love & I would definatly recommend it to anyone who likes sea animals.
2,irritating,"I have very sensitive skin and I found this cream irritating.It didn't feel good on my hands and kind of burned. If I rubbed it on my legsor where the skin wasn't as sensitive it was alright, but I'd have to wash it off myhands right away. I wouldn't order it again."
1,Hot Flashes,This is the second time I have tried this product. It has NOT helped me at all. I will not buy it any more.
5,If you love horses . . or horse racing . . .,This is a fabulous book for anyone crazy about horses and/or horse racing. You will devour the information about all the legendary Triple Crown winners. Also included are statistics from their other races and their times. Lots of photos (all black and white--my only complaint!) It's also current since no one has won the Triple Crown since Affirmed.
4,Eerie Queerie is a delight!,"Eerie Queerie, or Ghost, is simply an adorable manga. The plot is fairly simple, but good: Mitsuo, a friendless high school student, can communicate with ghosts. Not only that, the ghosts are able to take over his body at will. With help from his ""friend"" Hasunuma (a ""friend"" who delights in embracing and some sexuality-questioning kisses), Mitsuo helps these ghosts to wrap up their regrets and move on. With cute and awkward moments off-set by serious discussions about loneliness, regret, life, and death, this is definitely a ""must have"" manga. Not to mention the art's adorable."
5,Sordid Lives,"The funniest film in 25 years and yet it is playing in limited areas. In Palm Springs, CA , it has played for one year. I have seen it four times; some people have seen it more than 10 times. This movie is funnier than the movie, My Fat Greek Wedding. This low budget film starring Beau Bridges, Delta Burke, Olivia Newton-John, and Bonnie Bedalia is a must see film for everyone."
5,Way too funny!,"You must be open minded to watch this movie, but it is one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. And Amazon made it very affordable. Thanks Amazon.S. Meyer, MN"
5,"Perfect item, perfect seller!",I am totally satisfied with this purchase and this seller. I received the movie a lot quicker than I expected. The item description was accurate; it was a new product. I was familiar with the DVDs of the series; the movie was great!
2,Watch it for Brother Boy and Olivia,"A film by Del Shores featuring Olivia Newton-John and Delta Burke.Basically Del gets it right about returning home to the comical lifestyles of your relatives. The houses are right, the decor and accents are perfect.Delta Burke seems to fall into her role naturally, being southern herself. I am not sure why Olivia is here, but it is nice to see her.I couldn't get past the fact that the film looks so cheap. I realize it is an independent film. But OY, it looks like a camcorder was used to film it.The scenes with Brother Boy were hilarious, saved the film, and even drew a chuckle out of me. His ""de-homosexualization"" therapy was hilarious. That is the only strong point here."
3,A Lot Like The TV Series,"This dvd came out years before the television series came out. Many of the actors in the dvd version played their same character roles in the television series.While I enjoyed this dvd is was quite long and really needed some kind of introduction at the beginning for those who never saw the television series; it just starts ""right in"" so to speak. I had hoped for some background in the dvd version to better help me understand it all but there wasn't any.If you like the tv series version, you will like this. It's basically more of the same!"
5,Sordid Lives Laughs,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long while. The cast is the best. It is a laugh out loud type of script. Our group who watched it could not stop laughing. I look forward to seeing it again.
5,Alsolutely the best comedy,"I was dragged to go see this gem. On leaving the theatre, I could barely drive the car I was still laughing so hard. The characters had such depth and the actors did an amazing job in bringing them to life. I hope that this goes to dvd so I can enjoy it over and over again. Thank god I live in the Palm Springs area and was able to see this on the big screen.See this film!"
1,no snow in quebec?,I could not believe that the charge at quebec in a raging blizzard was depicted as a charge across a grassy field against a wooden palisaded fort. I had serious concerns about the accuracy of the rest of the movie.If you ignore the first 10 minutes it is a good dramatization.
1,As bad as it gets,"Bad casting, bad acting etc etc. I could go on but the others giving it one star have pretty much covered it. ~G"
2,not a good purchase - did not work,the tape worked for about one minutes maybe - - it dragged and would not work - they should test their tapes fully before selling them
3,Ocean of Tears - good read,"I was surprised by how much I liked the Ocean of Tears. It is set back in the time when Weille was the ""free port"" and during the formative days of the Combine Empire. Much lore is covered concerning the dark elves, Grieg and his invention of the spires, the Orcs and the high elves and many other facets of EQ1. This is wrapped around a story that is much more engaging than Rogue's Hour. While some of the die hards will disdain any attempt to translate their world of EQ1 into fiction, this is the best of the two published novels. It doesnt create new and unheard of lands and cities as was the case in Rogue's Hour. The Ocean of Tears uses the lands, cities and even spells of the original EQ and the Kunark expansion. I found that it brought back many fond memories of the landmark game."
3,"Assembly no big deal, basic unit","1 or 2 reviewers complained about assembly. In my case, assembly was no problem whatsoever.Resistance - realistically not much adjustability and it is difficult to adjust w/ the rubber band adjustment under the seat rail.Workout - it is fine. Device is stable and heavy enough for my 190 pound[...]without moving around. Not too loud, either. I'm able to watch TV while rowing. Chain doesn't have any trouble staying in its tracks. Seat adequately comfortable. If you have size 12 feet, you have to use low-heel shoes to fit properly in stirrups."
2,Less than expected,"Wish I could return the rower. Instructions on putting this piece of equipment together were horrible to understand and the equipment doesn't feel very sturdy. I've never reviewed anything I've purchased before on Amazon, I was compelled to let people know not to purchase this item."
4,worth $200,"It's relatively easy to assemble, although I did smash my finger pretty good while attaching the elastic cord. The resistance is not great, even if you pull really hard, so it does take longer to ""feel the burn"" with this rower compared to others. BUT, it is only $200, and you CAN get a good workout if you put a little extra time in."
1,Just as pictured but one year later the silver plating wore off!,"I ordered this ring because I love the marquise shaped citrine. The ring is big enough to be substantial but doesn't overwhelm my small hand (ring size 6). The metal is nicely polished and the stone is a nice honey color. Although the sides of the band are thicker than most rings, the ring still fits very comfortably on my hand. Great value for such a large gem.The silver plating has now wore off the band sides. I was under the impression that this ring was solid silver, it obviously is not."
3,"Ok songs, poor quality","It has a lot of good songs and the music quality is ok. The video is just above a poor home video. There are black edges on the wide angle, it's blurry, and has ~80's video fades. Yes, it's a kid's video but a little better can exist."
2,"Potential, but falls flat","I don't know what I was expecting out of this story, but this wasn't it. There is lots of potential for a great story, but it just falls flat. While the people in Mary's life are interesting, her life is not. You learn just enough about her family and friends to know who they are, but that's it.There was absolutely nothing to keep me interest in this book."
2,Mary After All: A Novel,"I was assigned this book to read for my book club. I could not recommend it to discriminating readers of literature. However, I notice that it seems to be selling well, so my opinion is probably a minority report."
4,Art History's History,"This is a great little summary of the discipline of Art History. It's a concise & well-written overview of the place of Art in Western History and Academica, from Ancient Greece to 20th Century America. You'll find it to be an easy but very informative read. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in Western Art, Philosophy, and/or History."
1,Art History's Misery,A plodding piece of literature in which the reader must wade through endless self-gratifying sentences in order to reach any material of artistic substance or value
4,ROBERT MUNSCH IS THE BEST!!!!,I thought this book was one of the best ones I had ever read. My favorite part was when Aaron got his hair back because he was happy again. The funniest part was when the lady had Aaron's hair growing on her stomach. My favorite character was Aaron's hair because it ran everywhere and real hair doesn't really do that. I think that the pictures were very good. This book reminds me when my friend had long hair and he didn't want to cut it so his dad told him to cut it and he did. I would recommend this book to all ages.
3,Aaron's hair,"This book was kind of good. My favorite part was when Aaron brushes his hair because it would go in the opposite direction. The funniest part was when the hair ran away.My favorite character is Aaron because I liked when he said, ""Hair, I hate you"".The pictures from the book are fantastic. The book makes me remember when I can't brush my hair. I would recommend my friend to read this book."
3,Okay Book,"I rarely used this book for MKT 352 marketing research at GVSU, but it had everything I needed from it when I had to study."
4,"great text, lousy pictures","I am currently enrolled in a Baroque and Rococo art history class at my university. I was told to get this book, and I excitedly did. After reading it for a bit, I noticed a few aspects that bothered me. The text is informative and explores the artworks wonderfully. Unfortunately, in the description, the authors describe the colors of the piece and how critical they are in the piece, which would be wonderful, except for the fact that half of the images in the text are in black and white! I would have to wait until class or find the images online in order to see what they were talking about.So, if you are looking to buy this book, just be aware that the writing and historical knowledge are wonderful, but the images are dull and mainly colorless."
5,A Gathering Of Old Men- as a high school english student,"I read this book in my english class- I found it to be a very good book, easy read and very easy to understand. I learned life lessons from it, such as... Stand up for what you believe in, respect others prides and weaknesses, etc. This book is a great one to read especially if you like to read in one sitting. I thought that the way the author wrote it from different perspectives really captured the feelings and emotions held within the people of the story. This book will change the way you think about life- and if not maybe it will at least change how you thought about racial issues before now."
3,Fine product but I question the price...,"Fine product but you'll find it cheaper at your local department store (like Kmart), and you'll get to choose the color. Although, most likely Amazon offers it for less compared to your local hardware store or pharmacy. I hoped for red or blue but they sent the standard and boring ""black"".Oh well."
1,Book titles are chioces,"I am concerned that the title of this book implies that those people who suffer from clinical depression are somehow at personal fault for their disease and, perhaps even worse, have somehow ""failed"" if they take prescribed medications to remain healthy."
1,Wading Through This Book Is A Choice,"While I remain interested in the topic and I'm in furious agreement with the basic premise that Depression is a ""kind of choice,"" I had a very difficult time making sense of this text. I kept thinking, did the author not have editors to correct her machine gun style ""free association"" written ramblings. This book's philosophy (though not necessarily the book itself) could be a great contribution to the institutionalized drug industry market hype that pills are the answer for the poor ""victims"" who have come down with the dreaded depression disease. Nice try. Try again!Dr. S. Brett Savage"
3,"Good first half, fair ending","Halfway through this book I would have given it a higher rating; an interesting and generally original plot with intriguing characters (even if handled a little heavy-handedly). But during the final few chapters, when you'd expect things to start 'coming together' and the characters to be fully developed, the plot seems to lose cohesion and comes to a somewhat loose ending (but by then I had lost much of my interest in whatever became of the main characters). Well, I enjoyed the book - but I think it could have been a much better one."
2,Targeted for women that don't believe there is a god.,"This book was a disapointment for me. Being a man, I could not relate to some of the things that she says. Also, the author trys to convince the reader to believe in a god, but I already believe there is a god. I did not like this book, but I will recomend this book to any woman that is unsure if she should believe in a god."
2,"Two Stories, But The Same","I have never read Foster before. This book is two stories in one book. But....the stories are almost exactly alike! Story 1, is about a rich man, and a woman who owns a lingerie shop. She doesn't want to fall in love with him, but does. Story 2 is about a rich guy and a woman who owns a sex toy shop (been there done that in previous story), he doesn't want to fall in love and she does. Both women get pregnant....ho hum. Are you kidding me???? Foster couldn't have come up with two stories less alike?????Doesn't say much for the originality or talent of this author."
2,mumbo-jumbo avant-garde,"I was not pleased with this bookIt seems to be written by some pseudo-intellectual that is desperate to impress with a fload of scattered ideas, way too many, and all meaningless CRAP.I waited anxiously for this book of nonsense and am quite dissapointed.I wish the other reviewers had been more honest.Difficult to follow and uninteresting at best.Buy a real book written in style instead of this roll of .... papier.."
1,Incomplete Order,"I ordered two planters with saucer, I received two planters, but only one saucer, which renders it useless! Unless you can send me another saucer, I must return the item."
3,Pretty good!,"Jo Grant (the Doctor's assistant) is taken on a trip in the TARDIS for the first time (in a wonderful sequence that encourages the viewer feel her excitement). The planet they arrive on is seriously drab though, and once they've arrived, the story begins to ramble a little over the course of three hours. (Amazon.com has already provided a tidy plot summary, so I won't detail it here.) Even by DOCTOR WHO standards, the effects and sets are amazingly cheap. It's reccomended only to the serious enthusiast of that peculiar genre of ""British Telefantasy"". But the story is solid, the characters are easy to get attached to, and it won't insult your intelligence. It's a diverting three hours or so, even if it doesn't wind up being DOCTOR WHO at its best."
1,Dissappointed!!!!,"Beware!!! The coupler lock pictured is not the one that Amazon sends. It is an updated model which is not as good. Also, Amazon shows two sets of keys but only ships one!!!"
5,Excellent Book!,"The Eye Never Sleeps, a commentary on the Faith/Mind sutra, is an excellent book, and one of the best I've ever read. Whether familiar with Zen practice or just wanting to know more about it, this book is definitely worth reading. Dennis Merzel has a very pragamatic approach to Zen Buddhism, and I find his approach well-suited to Westerners in particular. Definitely worth reading!"
2,Basic and Long-Winded,"Bought this because of the many positive reviews here and on the UK site. The book is not a great take on Zen for me: Too long-winded, repeats the same points over and over in a very concrete manner. Genpo talks about not straying, but seems to stray himself."
1,not what you expect!,"As a person who wanted to get a long life out of some nice dry measures, I thought I'd buy the cuisinart metal set - after all, the company makes a lot of quality kitchen stuff. WRONG CHOICE!!! The first time I used these today (to gently scoop and measure flour for bread), the thin handle bent. If you had these for a long period of time, such bending would probably cause the handle to break clean off... A huge rip-off, you'd be better off buying a plastic set at a dollar store. I plan on returning them!!!"
1,Only very basic information - a disappointment,As a very inexperienced mechanic I have found this book of little use to me as the information given is far too sketchy & not detailed enough on the differences between models...Far too expensive (in Australian dollars) for the information provided.
5,Silly and spectacular earworm buster!,"Whenever I play this the question is always ""What IS this?"" Well, it's the soundtrack of a bad Italian ripoff of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. called ""WHEN WOMEN HAD TAILS"" recorded in the late 1960s when Morricone was at the height of his psychedelic Italian period. The music is colorful (that's an understatement!), bouncy, gooey, and completely irresistible. If we ever have tunes caught in our head at our house, just a few seconds of this disc erases any earworm. To Morricone fans, this is worth whatever you'd have to pay to get hold of it. For anyone else, well... there's just no way to describe this twisty, carnivalesque, wet-puppy trip disc. You might find clips of it on Youtube, though."
1,Mildly bad!!!!,"I read this book cover to cover..twice!!! The authors did a terrible job explaining the Architectural Components in depth. For any novice or beginner, how would you expect to get a grasp on storage structures(tablespaces,indexes,blocks) if you're getting a half ass instruction on what the main key components are? Their explaination of the buffer cache was no more that 10 lines of text. Nothing mentioned about the different structures within that cache. And the same goes for the other components.And as the other reviewer indicated, its terribly organized.The index in the book is a total joke.I think this is a great book for beginners who want to have a ""general"" understanding of Oracle,but if you want to conceptually understand the material and not blow $125, don't purchase this book.Get Sybex. Its does exactly opposite of what this book does. It Covers just about everthing you need to understand as a junior dba and test taker."
4,"Groovy, hi-camp fun","Well, it's not the best of the Pertwee era, but it's not the worst, and it's certainly good fun. And Roger Delgado is true to form as the best Master of all Time and Space. Pertwee and Katy Manning have great chemistry as always. Look out for Dave Prowse (aka Darth Vadar's body) - he's the one with the bull's head that charges Jon Pertwee and his cape. The TARDIS console room gets a face lift, complete with Tupperware bowls in the walls. The Chronivore (antagonist #2 - his whites are VERY white!) is laughable, as he swings through the studio on invisible wires... BUT - if you're watching Doctor Who to see great special effects, you're missing the point! Grab some friends, some snack food and some drinks, and treat yourself to some truly groovy, 1970s fantasy."
1,"dull, unclear, disorganized and vague",This book is printed in a two color scheme that fails to draw attention to relevant points. Concepts are introduced with promises to be explained later. Components of code are not clearly explained. A sensation of being lost or of trying to stay awake during a long winded boring speech is what I found.Not good for the beginner.
5,Perfect!,This is an excellent book for both beginners and advanced Java programmers alike. A must-have for anyone's collection of programming books!
3,Mustela ultimate hydration,"I like the old line of mustella with ultimate hydration lotion much better ( it is discointinued )This new body lotion has a fragrant scent which I don't really care for ,because frankly I prefer very light scented lotions. It clashes with the perfume I wear."
2,Not a Flavor I liked,"I have been using the Cytomax Cool Citrus for over 3 years and thought I would try another flavor. I was not fond of the flavor, it has a floral small and taste. I suggest making sure you like the flavor before buying this large container."
5,One Of My Favorite Childhood Stories!,"""Elsie May and the three other members of her Ten O'Clock Club have gone into the fortune telling business---10 cents a fortune. They are using an old crystal ball they found in a magic shop. (It's all pretend, of course.)But the very first time the girls look into the ball they are amazed at what they see. Can it be that the ""pretend"" crystal ball really does tell fortunes?""This is a brief synopsis of a wonderful story about a group of little girls who live in an orphanage and are forever having adventures. There are other books in this series, but unfortunately all of them are out of print. If you are able to find them, I heartily recommend them to young readers!"
1,don't purchase,I bought this item and the bangs. They both look terrible!! Also having trouble returning items. I won't buy items from amazon if this is their return policy.
4,Check your sizes!,"Bought these for my 5-string bass. Indeed, they do vastly reduce the noise from sliding--which I do a fair amount in my playing. They were fatter than the strings I was replacing, and didn't fit into the grooves in the nut on the head piece! I suspect this was MY error in size selection, not anything to do with the product per se. So, I moved the strings down one position (E fit into the low B, for example) and they fit. For the G, I just let my old string on (funny look, but I can live with it.)Sound is darker. Indeed, not great for slapping (which I knew going in).Final impressions: If you slide a fair amount, and you make sure you're getting the right sizes, these are fine. The sound will be a bit darker than the metal-wound non-flat types, but that may be fine with your style."
1,"Beware this company,very bad BBB online credit","I ordered through thier web site 2 iphone cases 3 weeks ago,charged my credit card full amount on the same day with express 2 days shipping ,so far no confirmation email no delivery of the order ,thier contact phone number with no reply for 2 weeks ,I checked their record on BBB online and they have a very bad credit ,it seems It is a fake company and I lost my money ,Amazon should do an action and check my complaint by trying to call them ,no answer ,full answer machine ,please beware this company"
5,"Unique mystery anthology, by one of the best","Leigh Brackett is best known for her contributions to the science fiction genre, but she was also an accomplished writer of mysteries, most of which are anthologized here for the first time. The dustjack that wraps this book is itself a piece of art; the book is solid, well-crafted and beautifully illustrated. Brackett hits her stride early with the first entry that provides the title to this book. Tight writing, excellent dialogue. All-around well-done product!"
3,Okay sequel,Not as good as Shark attack I and 2 were but still okay. In mexico two megladon have start acting people. Chese parts I think this was supposed to be a rip of off Jaws 3. Like in Jaws three there is a bady and adult shark. But the adult megladon is freaking huge.The baby is about 15 feet long. The adult mother is huge 80 feet long. That about 2.5 times as long as the adult Shark in Jaws three. Good film like the other to shark attacks. Ending is not a dramtic as it was in the second one.I you like this film I recomend Shark attack 1 and 2. The best movie I could recomend Is Deep Blue Sea. There is Shark hunter also but it has a crappy ending.
4,Pretty good for a shark movie.,A giant shark is terrorizing people. Decent script. Good ending. Not bad acting.
1,"shark is fake, lines are weak and there is no acting","the dialogue and characters are totally bland and there is NO good line in the movie, they CANNOT ACT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES and are even dressed in wack clothing and this looks like a bad 80s movie.However, the main problem is the plastic shark that jumps out of the water and everything seems to fall into it's mouth.Is this a made for TV movie?? must be, because it clearly has NO BUDGET and the actors didnt even devote their time to personify the characters and roles they played.just one good thing...... this movies about shark attacks and the body count is big......but seeing people get eatin lookz fake and does not compare to jaws or jurrassic park. I konw the biology of sharks and i can tell u that this is FAKE FAKE FAKE and it looks like an inflatable toy that people fall intodon't watch this or u will want ur money back"
2,Good But..........,"This is a solid text for learning the basics of functional harmony. However, it really needs to be updated. For example most all of the modern music world uses I ii iii IV V vi Viio in Major but Piston just uses I II II IV V VI VII which makes absolutely no since at all!"
2,It's a controller.,"After about a month of solid use the stick began to screw up and some of the buttons started to stick. I go it for $15 at the time, but it still wasn't worth it."
4,Secure master hitch cover lock,I recently purchased a trailer hitch cover for my Jeep & purchased this lock to protect my cover from theft... My husband really likes it and says that it's very sturdy and that my hitch cover isn't going anywhere!!! He also likes the cover for the key hole. He recommends this lock...
5,Masterpiece of Critical Scholarship,"If there was one thing that H.P. Lovecraft detested, it was the tendency of scholars to focus on just a few leading figures in a subject and ignore the rest. Certainly, if he were still alive, he would be in a state of consternation over the fact that so many academic studies have been written about him while his contemporary Clark Ashton Smith has been ignored.Lovecraft's own piece of scholarship on the supernatural, Supernatural Horror in Literature, does not commit this cardinal sin despite its short length. This book reveals the wide spectrum of the horror genre. It also set the standard for scholarship in horror literature.Lovecraft was a pioneer in the field of horror studies. This book set the standard for both thorough research and perceptive analysis. As such it is a masterpiece of critical scholarship that is must reading for all horror fans."
4,Great piece of furniture,"I bought this unit to house my ever-growing home theater equipment. The stand was very easy to put together with the instructions. It took less than an hour to get the thing put together. While I love the wire management system in the back, it somewhat difficult to get the plastic piece around all of my cords. However, once you get it attached it provides a much cleaner look. I also looked at the Salamnder Synergy line but the height of this stand was much closer to the height of my television so I went with this unit. Be aware that this stand does not have wheels, so maneuvering it around can be quite difficult when it is setup with all of your equipment. I bought some of those cheap plastic things that enable you to move large furniture (sorry I cannot remember the brand name). It is probably the only way you could move it without taking your equipment off first."
5,great book,I like the dutch oven and this book helps to use it. I like the say flat binding which makes it great for reading while using it.
5,Dutch Oven Cooking Bible,"When purchasing my Lodge cast iron Dutch ovens, they come with a pretty good cookbook. This book was also recommended to me by a colleague who has been involved in Boy Scouts, as a young man, and later as a Scout Master with his sons.It's a great reference and my Dutch oven cooking library is complete...there's more recipes here than I'll likely ever use. Nothing like camp fire cooking in the Dutch ovens !!Regards..."
5,Nice,"Feel good and true to size. I liked these. I had been buying Hanes, but these will be my go to from now on."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE !,"I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues. About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer. These t-shirts are nothing but crap now! They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads. The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality. Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts. Here is another case of American immorality at it's best. Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours!"
2,sad but true,"I've been buying these shirts for many few years because I liked the fit. Since about 2008, they changed for the worse. The other negative reviews written here are accurate - the shirts are now made from thinner material, are wide at the bottom, short, and the necks seem to be stretched out already. I'll be back to looking for new shirts from a different vendor."
2,"Good item, I guess.","I made a mistake in buying this item, I misread the discription and thought it was a TV with turntable , not a tv turntable.I am sure it is a good product but I goofed up.."
4,A Good Book,"The book I just got finished reading is called ""Trick or Treat"" was an excellent book by Caroline Crane.The good thing about this book I liked was that it was exciting.Especially the part were the little girl dips here halloween candy into the sugar bowl but what she doesn't know is that the sugar has poision in it.The way that I compare this book to others books I have read is the best.All the other books Ihave read gotboring but with Trick or Treat I read the whole thing because it was so good."
2,A huge disappointment,"After reading and thoroughly enjoying another book by the same authors (which BTW I passed along to two other people with high recommendations), I was quite disappointed with this one. Maybe I just don't like a bunch of little tangentially-related short stories strung together in a single book, or maybe I just couldn't relate to a lot of the material. I don't know... it was just NOTHING like their other book, and I just didn't like it, and in fact, I didn't even finish reading it. In my opinion: One for the recycle bin."
2,Volume Control Failed,"The Labtec LCS 2420 stopped working quite some time ago. I am trying to revive it, and find that the problem seems to be with the volume control. There is a barely audible sound from both speakers, but twisting the volume control knob through the entire range has no affect. When I turn the power on, there is a ""thump"" from the woofer and speakers, but nothing really audible.I've checked my PC settings, and everything is at maximum levels and correct settings.Searching the internet for others with this problem has turned up nothing. The Labtec website email link to technical support just dumps you back into the FAQs, so there is no help there. I'll try their phone number, but as the warranty period is only one year, I don't expect much there."
2,If you child is g-tubed for feeding then this book is for you,"If you child is not eating by mouth but by tube installed in his(her) body usually tummy then this book is just right for you. I have a 4 yr old food refuser and bought this book , first to make her eat , second to widen her food choice. Author used so difficult language mostly related to feeding tubed children.Not worth to buy , if you child has no physical problems."
2,Once again the book is better than the movie,"Wes Studi and Adam Beach are excellent Native American actors but fans of Tony Hillerman and the Chee/Leaphorn mysteries will be disappointed. The book is much more entertaining. I read recently that "" Thief of Time "" which in my opinion is one of the best of the series is next for PBS. Here's hoping that they'll do a better job than Skinwalkers and stick closer to Hillerman's novel."
3,too slow paced for me,"This DVD has two workouts - the first one, I do to warm up for J. Michael's 30-Day-Shred. I don't do it by itself because I find it too slow-paced and my heart-rate doesn't really get up there. The second one, I don't like at all - the pace is just much too slow for me. I strongly prefer Lindsay's Boot Camp 2. Nonetheless, I do the first workout (with 30-Day-Shred) once a week, just to mix things up on easy days."
1,Way too big for size listed and Amazon charges for return,"I was very disappointed in the sizing of this shoe. I ordered a Florsheim and this one and this one (Neil M) was a least one size too big and very loose in the heel. Unlike Zappos, Amazon charged me about $5 for the return. I sure won't order shoes from Amazon again!"
2,Quality problem...,"Side support panel split when we attached it to the base with the screws supplied by the manufacturer. Contacted supplier, who sent another one. It split too. We decided to keep it anyway as this was the only vhs/dvd shelf we could find. Hope it doesn't fail..."
3,Only strengthens your collection,"This may not be essential, but if you have a huge collection, you should have this. This has all their well known songs. No notes except an almost xerox looking copy of the original back of the album. The sound is fantastic. One day they should think about a serious reissue of these seminal artists."
5,Sweethearts of Country Music,"I downloaded the mp3 of this great old time country CD. If you like old time country without all the drums and stuff, this one is for you!! Enjoy"
4,Brady ID Pal,"This is a very good unit for the price. I have owned and used 2 of them for several years and have used them in some very bad environments. Battery life is excellent, the only issue I have is that after awhile, I had to insert a piece of cardboard between the cartridge and printer frame, at the top, to keep it printing right. There are several other electricians in my department that also had this same difficulty. With the cardboard spacer in, the problem went away. Very tough and shock resistant. I would highly recommend this to anyone making a lot of labels for marking wiring. It is better than the high end Brady labelers in my opinion."
1,DON'T BUY THESE!!!,"I love love love these!! I got them mostly cuz my kitty kneads on me constantly & it drives me insane having her little claws dig in2 me all the time but these solve the problem completely. She didn't like getting them on too much but she got used to them in about 10 min. The only thing about them I don't like is that she paws the top of the litter box (I have a covered one) & it makes this incredibly annoying squeeky sound but I will definitely keep using them again & again.----I hafta update my review becuz u should NOT USE THESE!!!! They were OK the 1st 2 times I used em on my kitty but the 3rd time when her nails started growing, they started to push in2 her skin & made her bleed & were very hard 2 get off. My poor baby. : ("
5,LOVE THIS,"I have had this product for a few weeks now and I love it! It doesn't stink like most self tanners, but it does have a scent. Also, it is great because it has an instant tint so you can see where you are applying it. It really gets darker after a few hours. The color lasts for a couple days before scrubbing off in shower and applying more. Perfect to put on in the afternoon on a friday because then you will be dark by its time to go out at night! Love it! P.S. Make sure to clean skin before use and shave legs!"
4,hotsauce889,"I have light skin, and after I use this it gives me a nice sun kissed tan. No gross orange tint! I really wish I had bought the whole set though ( scrub, lotion, maintainer) because my tan fades on me fairly quickly. Ive seen a lot of reviews that the maintainer is key to keeping your tan longer. I have to put this on the night before, so it can really sink in or else showering will wash it right off. So bottom line..buy the whole set, because you will save money in the end by not having to reapply and reapply the lotion."
3,Great Color but doesn't last long,This tanning product smells good and gives you a good color but as soon as you shower it fades considerably and after two showers it's gone. I suggest this as a back up to a real sun tan to give you an extra sun kissed glow. This product would be my favorite if it didn't wash off.
3,"Decent, not great","This tanning lotion is just ok for me. Pros: Smooth application, good texture, pleasant scent Cons: Orange! My natural skin tone is fair to medium, so I normally go for the darker tanning lotions. This one looked great indoors, but once I stepped outside I looked awfully orange. I would not use this lotion for being outdoors, beach, etc."
5,Self tanning,Love the sun tanning product! Used a it years ago and so happy to find again!! Very easy to apply and the color results are natural and beautiful!
1,Orange,"I had previously written a low review for this product, and it was deleted. Hmmmmm.... Anyway, I loved the smell and application of this product, but the outcome was RIDICULOUSLY orange. I was not able to go out in public the day after applying this. I exfoliate before I self-tan, and I am not a self-tanning novice. I have used much cheaper products that give results heaps and bounds better than this. If only this product had any sort of a natural color, then it would be an amazing product!"
4,Great sunless tanner!,"I have fair, freckly skin and have a hard time finding sunless tanners that give me a nice color without looking streaky. I mixed this with my moisturizer and LOVE it! Smells great, turns a really nice golden brown, and fades nicely without the awful blotchiness my skin gets with other tanners. I haven't tried it alone, but it was really smooth and easy to apply mixed with my moisturizer. Also, the pump is wonderful. I will definitely buy again!"
4,Natural Looking,"I was pleased with how fast this shipped to me. It only took 3 days and it was ""standard"" 5 day shipping.The lotion itself I'm giving a 4 just because the smell is awful after 3 or 4 hours. That is the ONLY downfall about this lotion. I am fair complected, so I was a little scared to purchase the ""Ultra Dark"" tint. I am very happy I did choose this color. The color isn't orange in any way. It looks brown and completely natural. The first time I used it, I just put it on my legs to test it out. I loved the color and it washed off my hands. The 2nd time I used it, I used the lotion all over my body. I would recommend that you purchase some gloves. It made my palms brown. lol. It came off after a couple of hours though. I now just use some standard latex gloves to apply it. I also love that you only have to wait an hour to wash it off. I always wait overnight just to make sure. :) Like I said, I hate the smell after 3 or 4 hours and that's the only thing I hated."
2,Didn't like the handle,"It's nice that these brushes are ""green"", however, I have found that they're unusable because of the curved handle. I have found them really awkward to use, and it feels like I'm not brushing as well as with a ""normal"" brush. Also, it's hard to reach around your wisdom teeth with these.So if you're like me, and still have your precious third molars, you should probably look for another toothbrush :).Don't get stuck with 6 pricey toothbrushes that you don't want to use :(."
5,Great Brush!,"I thought the curved handle was just a marketing gimmick, but it really makes it easier to hold on to the brush. The bristles are very soft. I'm surprised to find that I really like this brush! I'm going to give the ultrasoft one a try next time. Highly recommened! You can also send this back to Preserve using a pre-maid postage label that you can print from their website to recycle the Preserve the toothbrush. Highly recommended!"
2,Above average but recycling it is not easy.,"This is an above average toothbrush. Holding it takes some getting used to and be warned that the ""soft"" bristles are much softer than other brands.My biggest beef with this product (hence the two stars) is they advertise a downloadable postage-paid mailer. When I finished my first toothbrush and went to the website on the box I was dismayed to find that they *no longer provided it*. It apparently cost them too much. You now have to pay for the postage yourself or go to some participating stores that provide recycling (all of which require driving several miles). That's ridiculous!The only reason I bought this product was because they advertised how easy it was to recycle. It turned out this wasn't true and I won't be buying their products again."
1,Not even as good as the manual...,"I bought this pump because I have the Avent Isis Manual pump and love it, but going back to work part time I needed an electric of some type. Well, I have had the Isis IQ Uno Complete for two months and I no longer even bother using it. I get faster results and more milk as a whole with the manual. This pump lacks suction, due to what I would consider a design flaw. The mechanical part is incapable of imitating your own pumping because the range of movement it uses is too small. Either that or mine is defective. Either way, I am left with an unusable, unreturnable breast pump which neither Avent nor Babies R Us will do anything about, so I guess I just have to buy another pump. Please, do yourself a favor and don't bother with this pump."
4,I absolutely loved this book.,"Guilt by Association by Susan Sloan has become one of my favorite books! Sloan's main character has many endearing qualities which make her so real and vulnerable. The twists and turns of her life lead the reader through decades of living almost ala Forest Gump. This reader experienced the pain and joy and untimate need for revenge along with the spirited Karen Kern. As if ripped from the headlines, politics and reality mix with suspense and mystery. Keeps you guessing until the end."
5,excellent,"This was,truly,one of the best books,I have ever read. From beginning to end. It held you and kept you reading. Although, it wasn't suspensful it held your attention. I recommended this book to anyone I knew who enjoyed reading."
2,Good gone bad,I enjoyed getting to know the main character in the first half of the book. She became a real person to me and I felt compassion and a kinship with her. However the ending becomes unreal because there is no way ...ever...that a victim of assault would have any of the voluntary contact with her assailant that the author writes of in the last chapters. It seems the author lost the sense of who the character was and therefore led me to abandon any connection with the book and it's ending. It's too bad because I was very involved until then. I cannot recommend this book to anyone because it will feel perhaps like a waste of time and a let down as it did for me.
4,Chan the Man,"Hold on to your seats because the master of martial arts from my generation just punched another hole in one! I wouldn't recommend getting this if you're hoping for a movie with a great love story or dynamic acting. This is simply Jackie Chan doing what he does best: creative, witty, and very unique action. As always, Jackie does his own stunts in everything (as hard as that is to believe) and packs a serious punch! Two thumbs up."
2,For serious Chan collectors only,"Be aware that these five films were made in Jackie's early career, when he had low budgets and little creative control.This DVD set is recommended only for the die-hard Jackie Chan fan, to complete one's collection. He is in his top athletic ability in his youth, though. So the action scenes are interesting to watch.Here are my comments, with IMDB ratings:Half A Loaf Of Kung Fu (5.8/10) painfully bad silly comedy.To Kill With Intrigue (4.8/10) formulaic revenge plot.The Killer Meteors (4.4/10) Jackie is the villain!New Fist Of Fury (5.5/10) a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" / ""The Chinese Connection.""Spiritual Kung Fu (5.7/10) actually kind of humorous."
5,Best game ever,Really awesome role playing game. There is always something to do in the game such as quests or missions. And during the holidays they have special things going on also.
3,Free is what you pay for.,"Mind you this is my mom's account.When I first saw this game on a store shelf I had to look again. It was that big sign that says ""FREE online play"". Yes this is an mmorpg yes it has good graphics yes it has all those things that make it great but there are some things that take away from this wonderful experience.1. ABSOLUTELY no replyability. Once you beat the game with one character there is nothing to do PvE wise. Even replaying the game with another character is the same.2.The cutscenes suck. Mouths dont move, dialogue is bad same old graphics as usual.3.PvE and after a while PvP gets old. Same old monsters same old fighters same old attacks again and again the only thing that changes is your scenery.The Pros have been covered already.This game is just OK. It's a goood introduction into the world of MMORPGs Even though World of Warcraft isn't free it's worth the money. I would recommend WoW instead of this product anytime."
2,GW is not an MMorpg,"If guild wars is an mmorpg then diablo,warcraft,and starcraft are.You are totally wrong.Everything is instanced,only seven players can be in an instance at the same time.Only towns have many players,which is necesarry becasue you may want to form a party for an instance.Even towns are broken down...they are broken into districts.If I am in seaboard district 31,and my friends in district 20,we cant seee each other becasue were in separate instances-annoying.Im not saying this is a bad game,its pretty good.But compared to WoW and other mmos its not too great.7vs7 battles in gw...fun...but what about the 100vs100 batltles of a real mmo?If you dont want to pay a monthly fee get this game.If you have the money,WoW is for you.2 stars because its competeing with MMorpgs,games that are MUCH better than itself.5 in fun...because its fun!you can go on,form a party,and complete instances casually."
5,"Finally, a Photo Rash Guide for Parents!!","An easy to use visual guide to skin rashes with symptoms, treatment, and explanation of the nature of the rash. Includes newborn skin concerns, childhood illnesses, and non-contagious rashes. Thanks to this guide, I now know that my oldest daughter had Molluscum, and my oldest son had scabies... they cleared up, but it is nice to know what the break-outs were. Its great to have pictures to go with the descriptions when you are trying to name-that-rash!!"
5,A Man Called Ham,"""A Man Called Ham"" is a great book. It is a fast read because you don't want to put it down. I love to read and I enjoyed this book as much as any book I have ever read. I am also anxiously waiting the author's next book."
1,Blu-ray?,"It's only in blu-ray. The first season can be bought by me, but the second can't because I don't have a blu-ray player... I'll buy it if I find it in the other format. I'll give it a real review, then."
3,"Great book, bad glue","Book has been great for the ASL interpreting class I am taking; however, the pages are falling out after I had only opened the book a few times."
2,Exercises in Ultrasonography,"I have to say that I thought this book would have more review questions in each chapter. Once you get passed chapter 1, you may get 15 to 20 review questions. I had hope to see more questions. The author failed to give an explanation to the questions and answers. Each chapter starts off with review questions. I would have expected to have read about the subjects before seeing the review questions.In the instructions for students the author says ""Pay attention to the key words and objectives"". Well I was certainly dispointed because I did not see any key words and objectives.The book contains unlabeled images and illustrations for every chapter but it failed to identify and describe the parts of the anatomy in the image. They leave up to you to figure out the parts of the image.I am certainly disappointed. I'm returning it tommorrow.MCP"
1,5 Stars for the Hitchhiker and 1 Star for Amazon,"This is false advertising, this is not the complete seasons. This simply volume 1 and 2 shrink wrapped together. No box set whatsoever.The series are awesome though."
5,Awesome Book For The Mad Mag. Fan,One of the most consistantly great things about Mad Magazine over the last 30+ years has been Al Jaffee's fold in's which were always on the inside back cover. This book features many of them with a before (not folded) and an after (folded) picture. The book is very sleek because of the excellant job that was done with the fold ins. If you're a long time Mad Magazine fold in fan you need this book.
2,Missed oppurtunity,"What a disappointment. A few minutes of wonderful new footage of the sun diced into tiny pieces, then wedged in between an endless stream of boring shots of the sun rising or setting over some horizon or mountain range. The most irritating thing about this film is that filmmakers go out of their way to bash the Catholic Church for being unscientific in persecuting Galileo, but then in turn exult in a series of pagan sun-worshiping cults. This made no sense. I wanted scientific information on the sun, not the filmmaker's opinion on religion. And not endless footage of people worshiping the sun. I mean, who cares? This was truly a missed opportunity. Let's hope IMAX will make a new movie about the sun -- and hire someone else to write and direct it."
5,Love our chairs!,"We really liked these chairs, they're quality is really great for the price. They go perfectly with our existing dining table."
1,"Adam Kirsch, Please, If You Are Out There, Stop Writing","It is impossible to stress enough the awfulness of this book. Kirsch's book reports disguised as reviews are bad enough, but these totally unidiomatic, humorless, intellectually miniscule poems are worse. He's an absurdity: he writes like a Prime Minister or owner of a fleet of Whalers. Somone stop him!"
4,suprising,"Waking up in the hospital with no memory is the least of Sydney's worries.Only eyewitness to a murder Sydney gets protection from Noah and maybe a little more.. A couple of turns I didn't expect, but I enjoyed the book."
1,Good story but not a Destroyer,These are not the characters I have been reading about for over 30 years. I realize different authors have different viewpoints about things but this is ridiculous. Mr. Somheil has taken a well established series and has tried to make it over in his own image. He can tell a story but he can't write Remo and Chiun. Thankfully Gold Eagle is not going to be the publisher of these books much longer. We can only hope for a better publisher with better editors and a writer who understands what this series is all about.
4,silver salve,This was recoended by a friend for skin problem and has helped me a lot. I would reccomend this for purchase for dry skin.
5,Great reading. Great Seal history.,"I enjoyed the historical context and the detail of research that the author did. This book sets the stage for the rest of the series and definitely gets you hooked. If you like Navy Seals, start here."
4,Not a bad book if you like Art History,"This book, as the title suggests deals with art from the Romantic period. The good points in the book are: it gives detailed and informative commentary on artists, sculptors, and architects, paintings, sculptures and buildings of the late 18th and 19th centuries. There are 215 illustations. The book puts the artists and their works in the context of history. The bad things in the book are: only 21 illustrations are in color. This may not seem that bad but color in Romantic paintings is important. The book has many illustrations of Turner's paintings, but if the viewer never saw them in color it is very difficult to get the whole meaning of the works. If the paintings were meant to be viewed in black and white they wouldn't be painted in color. That is why I gave it 4 stars. I recomend ART IN EUROPE 1700-1830 by Matthew Craske. It is cheaper, more informative, has better illustrations, and covers more material."
2,"Horrible sound, strong performance","This is the worst sounding SACD I have ever heard (I own 120 of them) and one of worst records of all time. The sound greatly improves for the oboe quartet, but the clarinet quintet is plain painful to hear and the horn quintet is just wrong (the horn sounds like if it was in another room).The clarinet quintet sounds like a partially demagnetized tape and the clarinettist seems to think that we enjoy more is clapping and breathing than we do Mozart. Truly unpleasant the only SACD I have not heard in its entirety (I stopped after 2 movements of the clarinet quintet and after one movement of the horn quintet, while I enjoyed the whole oboe quartet; the latter is the reason why I give 2 stars instead of just 1).The release of this product is unacceptable. Too bad because I usually like Kujiken quartet. Well, my only SACD that hit the bottom of a garbage bin."
1,Terrible,I bought this so that i could have a low profile antenna to help with my TVs reception. Before i got this I used a 3 foot piece of coax cable as a temporary antenna. I got OK reception but wanted a better picture. Using this antenna produced a worse picture than the piece of cable alone. I immediatly sent it back for a refund. Terrible product.
1,"Awful Movie, Don't waste your time","I wish I could take the time it took to watch this movie back. It was horrible. It barely has a plot, the background music is enough to drive you crazy. It has points cuts to old black and white zombie movies right to the very end of the credits. Spare yourself, don't watch this."
5,Great baking pan !,"Great baking pan ! The loaves cook evenly, and they are easily removed from the pan without breaking. It also cleans easily."
5,Stories not easily forgotten,"Interesting accounts of real people who claim they walked, or ""tesseracted"", into the past. Although there are 17 varied chapters,(176 pages) my favorite is the ""Five Adventures at Versailles"". The author gives some background on Versailles and the royalty who built it and lived there. Then over a generous twenty pages, the author describes and diagrams the adventure of two Englishwoman in August of 1901, and how after some normal sightseeing on the grounds, seemed to cross-over and perhaps time-travel to the actual Trianon during October of 1789.The same two ladies had another adventure on the grounds in 1908.When they researched and wrote a book (1911)about the incidentsthey were contacted by another family, who had independent, similar experiences in 1908. Also related in this chapter on Versailles are other fascinating experiences over the years until 1955. The puzzling accounts of those stories have stayed with me since I first read the book in the 1980's."
1,Beware if buying this item (DELUXE EZ Reacher) from Direct Care,"Wanted the ArcMate DELUXE EZ Reacher to get the SAF-T-LOK locking feature. Already own the standard model which works great, but thought the locking feature would be a real upgrade.Item Direct Care sent, however, was the standard model inside the cardboard sleeve for the DELUXE model. According to the sleeve, item should have had the SAF-T-LOK plus a DangEZ carrying strap -- but obviously it had neither because it was the standard model.Emails to vendor via Amazon did nothing except that Direct Care reported to Amazon that situation had been resolved -- that it had been a technical issue. WRONG as I still have the wrong item with no word from Direct Care that anything more is to be done.I eventually filed a claim with Amazon who reimbursed me via an Amazon gift card.By the way, a similar event has been reported by another buyer for the same item (DELUXE EZ Reacher) ordered from Perfect Fit via Amazon."
4,"Great CD, nice bonus tracks, nice remastering","Although not as good and timeless as Escape, this is still a great CD, with nice bonus tracks (even though they were available previously, it's nice that they are now where they should be - on this disc with the rest of the album). I wish all the Journey CD's got remastered like this one for the Legacy reissues.FYI: Here's the mastering scoop on the Journey CD's I like and own:Infinity (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)Evolution (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)Departure (remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues)Escape (not remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues, old 1996 remastering)Frontiers (remastered for 2006 Legacy reissues)They should have all been re-remastered."
5,CD version of Frontiers album by Journey,"There has been a resurgence of Journey music and I am happy to see it as I think Journey is, in my opinion, the best group that ever existed and Steve Perry the best vocalist. Their music stands the test of time. I believe Frontiers is the best album they ever released and Journey was at their best in 1983. The first five songs have videos that can be found on youtube. There are four extra songs from other albums on the CD version. It is rare that you find an album that has all great songs on it unless its a greatest hits album. This is one of those rare albums. You might also check out on youtube ""Journey Frontiers and Beyond."" That will give a story line for Journey for the newer fans or those of us who want to stroll down memory lane."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to own a Eureka tent. Like the color...set it up in the garage to seam seal it and am so disappointed. The bottom is the same nylon as the sides..there is a seam on the rain fly that is not sewn well. It was almost impossible to wrestle it up with even two of us. It will never hold up to Minnesota camping where it rains and can be 90 degrees. I liked the window style and the roof zip back windows in the roof so lots of good ideas. The poles were great, but the bottom would never work...never. Am sending it back and am sad that I won't have a Eureka tent. My friends have a Eureka and came over to look at it and they too were disappointed. I could never recommend this tent"
4,"Helpful, inexpensive","This is a very competent Bible dictionary, I'd say within a few percentage points of a modern one, and much more affordable =)"
3,Heard it before!,"This is a decent Thrash/Stoner Metal release with a Melodic Death Metal influence. The problem is that when I listen to this album, I feel like I've heard it before. I couldn't tell if I was listening to Testament, Down, or Godsmack. The vocalist really sounds like the singer of Godsmack! The music is basic with some very catchy Thrash Metal guitar riffs and played at high level with great production, but there's nothing that really stands out. All in all, I'd rather listen to Testament (The Gathering), Grimfist (G.O.G) or any old school Overkill albums. There's just so much great Metal being put out and Susperia are just average. I would have to say that the replay value is very low for this release. Anybody know when the new Testamet album is coming out?"
5,Alaska Through the Lense of a Skillful Photographer...,"""Alaska"" is the 10th anniversary edition of acclaimed nature photographer Art Wolfe's stunning photographic survey of the 49th State. Wolfe explores the major habitats of Alaska, from Mountain to River & Lake, Tundra to Sea & Coast, and Forest to Island. Alaska writer Nick Jens provides a supporting commentary on Alaska's natural history.The space, light, wildlife, and physical dimensions of Alaska can almost defeat a good photographer's ability to capture them. Wolfe's roughtly 150 photographs are therefore all the more remarkable for their consistently excellent artistry. For the non-resident, yes, Alaska really can be that spectacular on its best days. For those who haven't been to Alaska, yet, this coffee-table type collection is a superb introduction to what the state has on offer.""Alaska"" is very highly recommended to fans of Art Wolfe's superb nature photography, and to those who have or will visit Alaska's wild spaces."
3,OK,Overall the tent is nice. The floor is thinner than I would like. The design is nice and it did a great job our first camping adventure. I just hope it will last several years.
3,Revenge is the best exercise,I started reading and lost interest in this book. I am disappointed since I am a David Brenner Fan for a long time.
4,Item IS complete,"The previous reviews state this item is not complete. All you have to do is read the discription. This is the ""ADD ON"" for the Logitech Music System for PC's. It's for 'adding on"" another reciever (if you have more than one sterio receiver)to your exsisting system, so you don't have to buy ANOTHER transmitter.As for my actual review, it works great. I use it to run radio station streams and MP3's from my computer to my Surround Sound in my living room and also to my SECOND reciever I have in my garage. If you read the reviews under the actual item (Logitech Music System for PC's) you'll see what I mean. The only reason I gave this item a 4 instead of a 5 is for the price. I just felt it was a little high, considering I'm only getting the receiver."
5,Human frailty/emotion and commitment in compelling stories,"Brian McDonald has captured with openness, in parallel to gripping police stories, the conscience of boys and men, our human frailties and our self-doubts. He is frank and not confessional. Having lived through similar and analogous experiences I could not (nor could anyone with heart) help but be captured by his forthrightness and enthralling writing style. I laughed out-loud while reading alone and cried in crowds. This book caused me to reflect deeply on fathers/fatherhood, family and what big brothers mean. A must read! I recommend it to all my friends and family."
2,Not for those with Dyslexia,"This book's information is rather useful, but if you suffer from dyslexia, it is going to be a bear to get through. I am in the EMBA course at Baylor and was assigned this book. The blue ink used for the text wrecks havoc with my reading ability. It takes me nearly 40 minutes to read one page...at which rate I should finish it sometime in 2014.I strongly urge the editor, writer, and publishing house to use black ink in future editions."
2,Pretty thin on advice,"The only reason this book doesn't get 1 star is because at least it explains 2 or 3 exercises for each major muscle group, and gives an example workout schedule. That, at least, can get some uncreative people fit.Luckily I didn't have to buy this book, I got it at the library. The sum of the advice in this book is basically equivalent the sum total of what my old personal trainer told me on the first day.Also, the author talks an amazing amount about himself, considering the book is supposed to be about your workout and your fitness program."
4,Nice but...,"This is nicely made, however, the dog can push the bowl up out of the holder with its nose very easily. So, if you have an active dog that tends to tip over its bowls you may want to consider a different product. Otherwise it is very nice."
5,oldcon35,saw this film the year it was released and fell in love with it .finney was at his best and audrey was breathtaking.the level of sophistication is rarely seen anymore and mancinis music is spot on for poignancy..add moments of hilarity and heartbreak and you are presented with a cinematic treasure
5,pda protection,Best Quality. Recommend it if you have a pda. Came with all the great features that Franklin Time management product came with
2,"Content good, presentation and organization poor.","I agree whole heartily with Jo Totland's September 29, 2002 review, and would add the following.If you can stay in the book every day, consistently, until you get through the book, it's not too bad (although, the flow is lacking). However, if you get four or five chapters into the book, put it down for a week and try to come back to it, forget it.It has also not been a very good reference for me.If you're working with PERL full time, you should probably have it. If you use PERL occasionally, you might want to borrow it first to see if it fits your style."
2,"Too much waffle, not enough content","This book is absolutely terrible. I'm giving it 2 stars because I have managed to tease some capacity to program in Perl out of it, but at great personal effort.The book's tone is largely condescending, and full of awful ""jokes"", which get in the way of the actual content. It's most significant failing, though, is the weight given to waffle over actual programming examples. For example, the chapter on Threads spends 4 pages making analogies about threads with cooks in kitchens, and saying what a great effort it was to get threading into Windows, but goes on to give bare examples of threaded code with little to no commentary at all, leaving the reader largely in the dark. You are supposed to ""just understand"" the code snippets. This is completely the reverse of what you actually need out of a comprehensive programming book.Do your best to find an alternative way of learning Perl."
5,Wish I could buy the third edition,"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said about this book. Sure it is slightly convoluted in comparison to other programming classics (K&R, and know PERL is not a simpler language), but really it is the best book for helping gain the PERL mindset. I only own the second edition but I have worked with the 3rd edition while I was a TA in a CGI programming class. Basically after you have learned enough PERL to make it through Learning PERL then this book will answer all of your language questions."
2,! Concise && ( not very good with the examples),"If you want to look through murky waters to find a pearl then look no further.Like other reviewers I don't understand the concept of dilluding the content with wordless verbiage. A great book for me contains the following: tell me the important parts about the subject matter, give me concrete examples, show me some cool stuff, and please do it as quick as possible. I somehow think that the author had his mind on something else when he put this book together, longer/thicker doesn't make a better book.Don't get me wrong there is plenty of usefull information hidden within the passages."
2,a great book - for making me feel stupid,"Im a telecom technician familiar with UNIX, ksh, bash, Nawk, & BASIC. I thought I was pretty smart until I picked up this ""amusing, well written definitive guide to the language"". Im pretty sure its in English, but I can barely make out a word of it. To be fair, this is the second Perl book that has showed me up. Maybe its not the book but the language itself, with its smug ""theres more than one way to do it"", patronizing ""context sensitive, trying to understand what im saying"", and pretentious ""religious quality to the Perl community"". I will learn Perl (Im actually already using it when it cant be avoided). And when I do maybe Ill talk all fancy and wear a smoking jacket and write Perl poetry that parses in Perl, and be able to understand something in this book. Until then its trial and error, looking at other peoples code, and trying to understand something in this book through the tears. Maybe Ill get the llama book."
1,Not for Beginers,"I found the book to all but useless, the index is terrible examples are limiting, and there is little expansion of key concepts. I found most of what I needed from searching perl websites."
4,"Mandatory for Perl programming, but maddening all the same","This book is like the Perl tax: everyone involved with Perl needs to pay out and get it, whether they want to or not. There is no other place where all the innards and tricky bits of Perl are laid bare. In that regard it's a bit like sendmail admins having to buy the bat book (the o'reilly sendmail book).But unlike the bat book, and much as I respect this book and its authors, I find using it absolutely infuriating, not least because the index is a mess. Remember that perl is full of obscure little atoms like ., ^, $* and so on. You need an index that lists every darn one and their combinations. Unfortunately, the indexers of this book did not complete the job, which means that if you quickly want to refresh your memory about something small but important (like: whats the regular expression for whitespace, or is it .= or =. for string appends), you have to go trawling through the whole book."
1,Really Bad Product,"I registered for this pump based on reviews, and it was not a good product. First it took about an hour to pump 3oz, second, the battery travel pack seems to overheat and shuts down after 10 minutes, finally the pumping mechanism broke after exactly 19 days of pumping. I was pretty dissapointed since I have been pleased with all of the other Avent products I have purchased. I ended up purchasing a more expensive pump. I recommend any new mom not to waste their money on this product. Just rent a pump at the hospital or go ahead and purchase a higher quality pump from the get go."
5,A pretty nice sheet for a good price,"Baking sheets seem to get destroyed with me. Maybe it's normal and not just me, but from baking cookies, pizza, potatoes, salmon, etc. over time they just tend to get all dirty and no amount of scrubbing will clean them. Rather than putting a bunch of money into a really nice one, I have taken the stance of getting sheets that are cheap and easy to replace as needed.This sheet was highly rated and very affordable. It has no extended edges for easier gripping like some of my previous sheets, but it does the job and does it well. It is not supposed to be cleaned in the dishwasher for fear of discoloration, but it cleans well with hot water and a sponge. It feels flimsy and light, but seems pretty durable. Food doesn't stick too much, which is definitely a plus.All in all, it's a pretty impressive quality sheet for the price."
5,Does not warp,I have used this pan for a few months now and I love it! My favorite part is that it still sits flat on the counter. The pans I've used in the past would warp and totter on the counter. My favorite thing to make on it is roasted potato wedges. It is also nice and easy to clean. Great size!
4,Good pans poorly handled,"I just received the two Nordic Ware half-sheet pans I had ordered. Each came with a dimple in the bottom (fixed with a hammer & punch), and the one with the larger dimple also had several sharp burrs on the underside (fixed with a file). Examination of the plastic wrapping suggests that the problem occurred before they were wrapped at Nordic Ware.Otherwise, they are flat and square and fit my Silpats so they should make good baking pans."
2,Difficult to clean,"Although it is not a really bad sheet to cook (we use it for pizza mainly), it is a nightmare to clean and gets scratches just from looking at it. Food sticks on it, even with oil, then it is better to use non-stick paper and avoid these two problems."
4,Nice!,I have used this to bake cookies/ french fries and it works great. For the price its sturdy and good enough.
5,Perfect,It's great. What else is there to say? I've used it to cook a Thanksgiving turkey that had been spatchcocked.
2,"Nice, intro to rock climbing, but lack any depth.","The video is first, extremely short due to it's made for television format. I have seen longer Northface advertising videos at REI, that come to think about it were more interesting. But hey they never said this was a how to or documentary, so I am cutting them some slack. Only shows Joshua Tree, climbing at the best time of the year using the easiest routes, on the best climbing surrface in the 48."
1,Seriously?,"Cuttlebone casting is a great jewelery technique. It has much history and provides an amazing texture. However, $26.00 bucks for 6 bones is neither great, nor amazing. Fun fact; cuttlefish bones are used as a mineral supplement for pet birds. Therefore, they are available at every pet store on earth, even at Walmart. I just picked up two yesterday for a holiday jewelery gift, they cost me 98cents each. I wouldn't even mind paying a premium for quality cuttlefish bones but $26.00 dollars for a half dozen is outright theft."
2,"B level acting, C script and D directing, its that bad.","I feel sorry for the actors who were forced to work with this terribly written script and poor direction but as we know, Hollywood is more interested in churning out these awful ""straight to dvd"" horror films.The movie concerns teenager Gail Bowers (who is obviously much, much older) and her sister and sisters husband who move into a new house after the Bowers parents die. Withing 2 days, Gail suddenly becomes possessed and people start dying. All of this poorly paced plot is thrown at you in the first 20 minutes.While I do give credit for the attempted effects and eerie feelings, ultimately its amature-ness makes it almost silly.I bought this at a huge bargain sale after reading reviews saying ""its not that bad"".Uhm....yes it is."
3,Haier 102,"For the money its a good Cellar. The pictures all show a digital readout but it is not availible on the newest model. They give you a green light to show that the machine is running. You have to buy a thermometer, place it on a shelf and open the door to get a reading because you can't see it through the smoked glass.As to the 102 bottle capacity...maybe if you only store Boones Farm. Odd sized bottles consume additional space.Compressor is a little louder then the smaller Hair units, buy its livable.Not much of a choice in any units between $700 and $1000, so I justify it by saying this is a good compromise."
4,Garret Ace 250 Metal Deyector.,"Works very well. Just started treasure hunting. I think the unit is very easy to use. Wish it had a smaller earphone jack or came with an adapter, so I would not need to buy one."
4,Garrett ace 250 is a good machine,"Hi, excuse me for my bad english. I bought this ace 250, is my first metal detector, i found a lot of coins, not gold or silver until now. In my garden, and in sand beach. Is a really good machine until 18 20 centimeters max (coins). It discrimines well iron from coins, is easy to use, is sensitive, battery have long life, and it tell you exactly proof of target. In sand beach is good too, no problem. It is perfect for detect coins, not the best for detect gold. The pin pointing is good too, you need to practice to improve your precision, and of course reads the manual and see the dvd, in the first week you will know this good machine, his differents sounds. For beginners and not so on, very good metal detector (until 20 centimeters for coins). Good luck!"
3,Garrett Ace 250 Metal Detector,After buying this model of metal detector I am assuming you have to spend $500.00 or more to get one that really works.
2,it sucks,"no matter what you set the detector for, it picks up all metals. i will return this asap,cause it sucks,it is cheap. in my opinion it does not preform properly."
1,"Parts missing, maybe a used metal detector?","I opened the box and the knob that attaches the search coil to the rod was missing so there was no way i could assemble it. Also there was no instructional CD in the box as well.There was a zip tie in the box so i zip tied the search coil to the rod together tight to where it stayed in place firmly just to test it to see if i just wanted to send the entire item back. Well needless to say the metal detector was picking up metal everywhere it went giving false readings. One second there was metal there and the next there wasn't.It made me think that this might have already been returned by someone else. Anyway, I will not be buying another ace 250."
2,Very short,"While I'll agree that this game looks good and adds a few new twists to the shooter, the story is very narrowly structured and the game is way too short.You should see a lot of these on the 'for sale used' list since most people will finish it quickly and it has almost no replay value."
1,DO not purchase,Because of the copy protection used avoid this product to make a statement. It is a bogus system. limited reinstalls and securom features that are making the game crash often.POS copyright protection means no sale.
2,"Graphics good, DRM baaad.","The DRM software this game installs on your hard drive actually disabled another paid-for entirely legal game on my hard drive. (silent storm - sentinels)I contacted securom about the problem, and they actually sent me an updated file (ar.exe) that was supposed to fix the problem. To make a long story short, the game is still broken.I have to say, the graphics and environment they created in Bioshock is good, so if thats what you're into go for it. But the game is waaayyy too short. And just be sure to check and see if the rest of your installed games will still run after you install it.Seriously."
3,Its OK,"If your on a PC you'll need what the game recommends as the best performance hardware to really enjoy it. So far, I haven't beaten it yet. It's a little too hard for 39 r old guys but my 15 yr old son digs it."
3,Done before,"This game ran great, very stable. (especially compared to HL2) The graphics are pretty good and I found it to be pretty entertaining for a first person shooter. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that it is a complete rip off of System Shock 2, and System shock was a much more interesting environment I thought. They simplified the inventory for bioshock, which was an improvement, but it is pretty much just an underwater version of that game. Not very original."
2,Trouble with Bioshock,"Nagatives: The Mouse Control is very poor, it feels like you are using a broken mouse -even in the setup protion, before starting the game. The controls are so poor that you feel like a retarded newbie playing for the first time, because you cannot move correctly. Just image playing Doom with a broken mouse.Positives: The Story is very interesting, you are this Andrew Ryan, and you go to this under water world to save your son Ralph Ryan. Andrew's Ex-Wife was crazy and was out there killing kids..."
3,Good Game !!!,"BioShock takes time to do, at a normal play up. I would say,it has beautiful picture, thrown in..."
3,A Shooter,"A decent shooter with nice graphics. Definetly need a current system with 2 gigs and a good video card. Gameplay is a bit linear (o.k., alot linear). Good recreation."
3,myreview,"other than the foul language it is a good game. lots of imagination when into it, knowing what i know about the game, i would probably not have purchased it. i believe you really don't need ""f"" words or contaminating the name of Jesus Christ to make a game great."
1,SecurRom is not for me,"As much as I enjoyed the Bioshock demo, (Which installed SecurRom in C:\Documents and Settings\...\Application Data and my registry) I won't be buying this game. If I buy something I won't be told how I use my property. Sorry."
5,Awesome game - HIGH SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS,"The game is fabulous - I have played it on the XBox 360 because my PC can't play it.IMPORTANT: make sure your PC system can run it. I have a pretty powerful, albeit older, video card, a Radeon X800XT, and I can't run the game.I payed $320 for my video card around 2 years ago and I can play many other high end games decently. That doesn't matter, this game will not play on my system.This game requires a feature on your video card called Shader Model 3.0.If your video card only supports SM2.0, you will not be able to run this game.**There are no drivers that can add support for SM 3.0. SM 3.0 has to be built into the design of the card. (added in response to driver updates solving this problem)"
3,This game is good not great,If you love First Person Shooter games this game is great. That being said if your not crazy about FPS titles this game is still good but don't expect to be WOWED by it.
2,Incredibly stiff keys,"I can not believe how stiff these keys are. I thought that this was not going to be a big deal, but it was a deal-killer for me. On the plus side, it is angled nicely with a comfortable hand pad. Unfortunately, the hand pad takes up a lot of real estate and can not be removed."
1,"OK initially, but falling apart after 6 months","Update: After fighting this stupid thing for 6 months, it just went in the trash. Every time someone tried to use it, the entire unit either comes off the base, or the top metal bar pops off (generally flies about 2 feet, and I'm immediately imagining it hitting one of the kids in the eye). Why oh why did I waste nearly $20 on this piece of junk?!?!Original review: Oh how I miss the old-school, basic pencil sharpener. Our family has tried a couple different models, and I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it's hard to get the body properly snapped on the base, the rotating size selector won't lock in, and there's only one blade so sometimes the sharpening is a bit uneven. IF you can get it assembled and hold everything in place, then it does a sufficient job, but I can't really offer a glowing recommendation."
4,like the good old days,"It is a good metal pencil sharpener like the one you remember from elementary school. It does the job, nice and sharp."
4,Nice book,"We bought this for a gift. The recipient loved it. It's not a large book, but we knew that when we purchased it. A nice book for the price."
2,A lot of empy pages of exercises.,"This book is primarily promoted by Avatar class graduates and instructors.I am not one of those. I do not recommend this book, unless you really like doing""exercises"" out of a book, or are really in deep psychological trouble."
3,great for dry hair but not ideal,this product smells nice and is moisturising but you can't go more than one day without washing your hair as it looks very oily. I recommend using a clarifying shampoo every other hair wash.
5,amazing,i bought this item yesterday at Mad Marks in bradenton fl it blew my mind away for 250watts peak it sounded amazing but wat im seeing that is different from online n in store is that i bought them cheaper in the store than online but i would deffinitly recommend them
1,Foot hurt worse with this,"I used this on one run. My foot hurt worse then before. I finally went to a running store and got fit for good shoes, and my feet feel much better."
2,Spend a couple more dollars and get ones that really work!,"I've tried these because the FABS that I'd been using worked SO well, I thought I could get the same results for a few less dollars. WRONG!!! These were a complete waste for me. Couldn't get the support and they were much less comfortable than the FABS. Learned my lesson and went back to the FABS...believe me, they are WELL worth the few extra $$$!"
3,just ok,"Was hoping this would 'really work'. I probably had to high of an expectation based on what I read, but didn't get any great relief. It has 'helped' but not ideally. Still looking!"
3,okay for me,I play basketball and get wicked shin splints on the second or third time playing a week. This product elevates the pain. I wish it would let you adjust how much support to give you as sometimes it is too much.
2,There are better arch supports out there,"The Arch Supports by Footsmart work better than these. These do not provide enough support and thus don't alleviate the pain associated with plantar fasciitis. These had such good reviews, I thought I'd give them a try. I was disappointed and will go back to the footsmart ones in the future."
1,pro-tec arch supports,This product is worthless. There is no flex in the fabric so it is impossible to tighten it enough to make it function or even keep it on your foot.
1,Useless,"Ordered the compression socks, at least that was what was in the photo and description, got these instead. They do not tighen proeprly, and slide off the end of your foot easily. Not what I ordered, but told the part number was what I ordered. Shame Amazon lets people like this sell on their web site!"
1,Poor Arch support,"This product caused me more pain than it relieved. Don't bother to purchase this, especially if your feet are slender, it will end up being loose and will not stay in proper position. It added no support whatsoever, and after using one day at work for my plantar fasciitis I was limping worse than I started off the day."
2,Didn't meet the requirements,Didn't work for me. I bought this for my plantar facia but it did not provide any relief/help so I returned it.
2,Good seller - Poor product,"From the other reviews I read, this was the best product out there for help with Plantar Fasciitas. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. It may be OK for wearing around the house, but when being active running/basketball/et. it quickly slides down your foot and no longer provides any support in your arch."
3,movie,Could not download it on Kindle Fire so we never saw it. My grand daughter was disappointed but played games instead and was happy with those.
3,"Wait a minute - ""The black Beck""??? Excuse me??","So... Tammy La Gorce, amazon.com editorial reviewer, believes Prince to be ""the black Beck."" What a ridiculous statement. Nothing against Beck, but his first album came out in, what - 1994? A decade-and-a-half after Prince began recording, heavily influencing so many artists (Beck included). I guess B.B. King must be the black Eric Clapton?That said, this new Prince release is actually far less interesting than the last couple Beck releases. It's okay, I guess, but really has very little memorable music. I'm often called an ""honorary woman of color"" due to my tireless efforts to promote equality among the races. Even so, I've been called an ofay many times in my life (I always turn the other cheek). I also used to work in the music industry (I managed a mid-level rock band, as usual I'm not naming names). Trust me, I could work up a much ""blacker sweat"" than TAFKAP, er... Prince."
4,Prince is PRINCE!,"To respond to Amazon's review...I too think Beck is a great artist and no disrespect, but Prince is not the black Beck - Prince is PRINCE! The only black anything Prince is...is black Prince and 3121 proves it. The influence of Prince is all over Beck. Again, no disrespect but do not compare Prince to Beck. Prince is in the Master Artist league of originals along with Bob Marley, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson."
3,Synthesized Sound,"Prince returns with a decent follow-up to 2004's Musicology, 3121. On the new album, Prince harkens back to the 80's synthesized sound of pops, crackles and squawks. This is best showcased on the song ""Lolita"" which employs a stripped down sound built around a heavy electronic sound. ""Black Sweat"" has a start and stop rhythm with a crackling synthesizer. The ballads are the weak part of the album with only the sultry ""Satisfied"" really hitting the mark. The best two tracks on the album are ""Fury"" and the album closer ""Get On The Boat"". The former is a blistering rocker that recalls his 80's glory days and the latter is a full-out funk jam that features the great Maceo Parker and burns the cd the down at the close. 3121 has its moments and it is a tight collection of only twelve tracks (mercifully he has seemed to stop over bloating his albums with filler) that helps cement Prince's comeback."
3,Rather disappointing,"I must say, after the freshness and success of Musicology, I was hoping for something as appealing from Prince's latest effort. Alas, it seems that Prince's style now sits uncomfortably between the latest commercial rnb drivel and whispery memories of his former glory. ""Lolita"" sounds embarrassingly out of date, while ""Incense and Candles"" sounds like it could have come from any commercial rnb debutant.Saving graces include ""Black Sweat"", a genuinely edgy track that reveals glimpses of inspiration and originality; ""Satisfied"" is definitely the aural sequel to Musicology's ""On the Couch""; and ""The Word"" personally does something to me, I don't know, Prince's meandering voice hits the spot with this track. And ""Beautiful, Loved and Blessed"" is your standard chart-pleaser.Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks take a little more effort to enjoy than is comfortable."
4,"THE PRINCE HAS RETURNED""FUNKY,FUNKY""","THIS CD IS PURE PRINCE THE WAY HE ""IS NOW"" NOT HOW SOME WRITERS WHO CANNOT ACCEPT ARTIST WHO ""EVOLVE AND GROW"" WANT HIM TO BE. YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET OVER YOURSELF. R U THE SAME PERSON THAT YOU WERE BACK IN THE 80'S-90'S? TO ALL YOU WHO THINK THAT THIS ALBUM OR ANY ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. SO COULD YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT, YOUR GPA IN HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE, YOU RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD ETC. BUT GUESS WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE. THEY COULD NOT BE ANY BETTER AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE!!! GET IT? SORRY FOR THE POP PSYCHOLOGY BUT I HAD TO GET THAT OUT. THIS CD IS TIGHT!!!!!"
4,Coming back to us,This album reminds me of why I am such a huuuge Prince fan. You like Prince? Then buy this.
4,"not his best, but certainly one of his better efforts","I really enjoyed the mix of sounds in 3121. As stated in the Amazon review and that of numerous individuals Prince incorporated a wide range of sounds into this CD. At its core 3121 is very funky. Looking at the reviews, I see that 9 of 223 people rated this CD 1 star. 21 of 223 rated it 2 stars. So that's 13% of the reviewers giving a 2 stars or less. If you take a quick read of those reviews, you'll find the majority are not really Prince fans or are simply looking for a specific Prince sound from an earlier era. True fans can make arguments for 3 to 5 stars, but will probably agree that this is a very worthy effort from Prince...By the way my favorite track is probably Get on the Boat with Black Sweat a close second."
5,Gerber Daisies = Perfection,My shower curtain is exactly like it looks in the photo--very classy and not pixilated like some of the reviews for other flowers say. It's a nice weight and dresses up my bathroom wonderfully!
2,not worth it really,This book is a bit light on for photos. If you are buying it for ideas for a modernist inspired garden you might be disappointed.
4,Works pretty good.,A little awkward but you figure out ways to use it effectively. Have to get used to adjusting it as it is different than the standard cord.
5,I had no initial use for them...,I imagined a day a friend would come to my house and ask to borrow a bungee cord and I would have to say I didn't own any. I bought these for the simple reason that I believe every man should have a few of these at his disposal. I'm surprised McGuiver never carried one of these.So the day came when with great purpose I rummaged through my tool closet to pull these babies out to wrap up a few stadium chairs to a collapsable cart. I think I did impress. lol
3,"Small figures, easily misplaced","I have a 2 1/2 year old who LOVES all her little miniature Fairytopia sets, however...the little fairy figures seem to go missing very easy as they are tiny. This I don't have a huge problem with, what I have a problem with is the fact that I can't seem to BUY more tiny fairy figures!!! This would appear to me to be a big flaw in thier marketing of this product, as I am not going to go buy a whole new cottage just to purchase more fairies!!"
4,does the job,simple - a lock that works and is easy to spot. I've had master locks for years but lost my old one... the color on this one is really fun
2,Not impressed.,"I covered the entire left side of my CoolerMaster 690 II Advanced with this and it did not make any discernible difference in the fan sound emitting from my case.On a positive note, the adhesive does stick well."
3,GUNS 'N BUTTER,"John Singleton wrote, produced and directed this film, which takes place in the 'other' underbelly of LA : the neat black neighbourhoods. And despite shootings in the streets, the area stays neat. No neighbours getting involved, no police investigating shootings, just business as usual.The best thing about this film is Singleton's penchant for surreal [...] scenes, similar to John Schlesinger's ""Midnight Cowboy"" fast-cut [...] interludes ...An honest film about boys and girls, with respectful performances by everyone involved ..."
4,nice film,"Not as preachy or sappy as some of John Singletons other pics. Little too much sex for my taste (When I want sex I'll rent porn, thanks). But this movie is funny and true to life. Its about a man who has two babys mammas and doesnt want to settle down, hes a mommy's boy and things get ugly when mom gets a new man. The main characters are interesting and you get some laughs out of this movie. I dont believe it is just a ""black"" movie its a really good watch. Snoop has a small part and his acting is decent."
1,Poor acting and full of stero types,"This is a poor movie on all scales. The acting, plot, and characters were all weak."
2,So and so text in Quantum Eletronics.,I have used this book for 3 courses in my faculty and i find this not a very good text for students.Mr Yariv style is a higly nonlinear one and he constantly assumes you know the things that you bought the book to understand.On the plus side his book is very comprehensive.I rate this book 2 stars.
2,Disappointing,"I am a Pitcairn Island enthusiast, so when I found this book, I couldn't wait to start reading it. The book started out okay, but soon I got bogged down by the author's constant negative descriptions of everyone she met and everything she saw. The final straw came when she whined about her ""mistreatment"" after she seduced a married man. Get a clue, woman! What did you expect? I am giving this book two stars instead of just one for the following reasons: 1) The subject matter is so fascinating that any book about Pitcairn Island is worth reading. 2) Dea Birkett could be a good writer if she would stop being so negative"
1,Don't read this book,"This book was sorely deceiving. I kept reading and waiting for the ""danger"" to appear. By the last page of the book, no danger other than gossiping old ladies had appeared. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the author was narcisstic. There is little characterization of the inhabitants of the island or follow-through on events or characters introduced. I had no prior feelings toward the Pitcairn Islanders, but I feel they were grossly misrepresented and maligned in this book."
3,What Can You Say?,"I bought this book because I am very interested in Pitcairn Island and the society that lives there, and on that note the book does deliver. However what started out as an interesting adventure to and case study of the island, ends up a pathetic story of a horrible woman that left me feeling embarassed for taking part in, if only as a reader. This woman has some serious mental problems and in the book digs herself into a hole. It's no wonder the people of Pitcairn prefer thier isolation when they have expierences with people like Debbie Birkett to give them impressions!"
1,Not puchased.,This item was sent to me in error and was returned. I cancelled the order because the shipping was too expensive for such a small item. Purchase price was fully refunded.
3,Reasonable,"The book is a little long winded and in some cases appears to have information that is there to fill the pages. However, it does have some good advice and some good information. I will follow up on a good deal of what they suggest."
3,So so.,"This book doesn't really provide anything of substance. It's written in a rather specious style interspersed with occasional bits of humor.It could've been made better by actually making reccomendations rather than providing generic advice about things. I didn't come away from the book feeling like I actually learnt anything new.This book has more than a few pages, and probably could've been used more constructively rather than endless anecdotes. Not so much 'an owner's manual' as the title suggests. More of a: we'll tell you what you've already been told before, and has been printed many times before, except we make a few jokes here and there."
1,disappointing,"We had been looking for Brady's Escape for a long time, as it used to be our favorite to watch with our kids.When we found and bought this copy, we were happy.However, the tape is in very bad shape; in a word, unwatchable.The story itself is quite good as is the acting, but the quality of the tape is such that we had to send it back."
3,Fairly unmemorable.,"I bought this primarily because it was supposed to be the book with Nehemiah Scudder, a character of potentially magnificent villainy along the lines of 2000AD's Torquemada. Unfortunately, he doesn't really get much of a mention. The story itself is pretty much standard Heinlein stuff but without some of the gems which usually make his stories shine. Worth reading if you're a fan of Heinlein's stuff but a bit weak as a stand-alone piece."
5,this is a keeper,"I've had my book for about 20 years. I started collecting recipes in it before I was married. I'm getting ready to buy it again. I want to start from scratch. I included some recipes in there that in hindsight I will never make, and don't wish to have permanently recorded in this book. i want to start a new book and record only my favorite recipes that I want my daughters to have. If you like to cook and collect recipes, you'll love this."
2,missing pages,"I ordered 3 of these recipe books and gave out at Christmas time...haven't heard anything from 2 of them BUT the one I gave my granddaughter has missing pages in it.....the TABS only go to the letter L........there are no tabs for M<N>O>P>Q>U>R>S>T>U>>V>W>X>Y>Zif I had opened this and discovered it, believe me I would have sent back!"
3,Not for prime time,"I found The Final to be a far less scary and much more violent movie than I was looking for. I'm tired of being hit over the head by senseless bloody violence in movies. Give me a good spooky movie with an interesting storyline that doesn't involve zombies, vampires, or mindless physical torture (SAW movies, ugh) and I'm a happy camper. The acts of violence committed by high school kids on their peers in this movie seemed a bit too real and definately shouldn't be viewed by a younger audience. As a rule I enjoy horror movies that reward me with suspense rather than in-your-face violence. I give the move 3 stars for being what it wants to be but there are far better scary movies out there to spend an evening with. I recommend that you skip this movie and pick one that will chill your spine and exercise your brain at the same time. Movies like Psycho II, The Sixth Sense, or even Poltergeist come to mind."
1,Crappy,Never buy from GO Hastings Again. Horrible condition. DVD looked as King Kong sat and it. Fingerprints all over it. DVD did not even work.Title all ripped up. I knew it was used but there was no reason for this contition.
3,Good book,"I am happy I bought this book for my friend. It was a good price and in good quality. However, when I received it, it was slightly dirty on the removable paper cover so I ended up removing it all together."
3,"the good, the bad, and the better","This actually started out very good, particularly the first four songs. They are just really good AOR with just the slightest hint of prog. Seriously, very good stuff. The Raging Fire was a good song, but starting with that song, the cd makes a pretty quick decline. Sin City is really bad, as is It Should Have Been You. The key is, if you are putting filler in a cd, don't put them three songs in a row; it completely kills the momentum that has been built to that point. When Run started, I thought it might break the filler pattern, but it doesn't. While Pyramid Princess is ambitious, I think the song should have been saved for Kansas, but it's a good song, nonetheless. I'm not meaning to nitpick it. Winds of War is really good, too. In summary, this cd starts out really good, dies, and then ressurects itself into a decent cd. If you want to buy about six good songs, this is your cd, but make sure you want to suffer through some low parts."
5,not the only nut,"Ladies and gentleman, i implore you to read this riveting book on your ex president George H.W. Bush. No surprises here for me, but you might be shocked.This book is very detailed on how and why the man was our president. Just a suggestion, try not to focus only on Bush, he was only serving the purpose of the few elitist illuminati."
5,Kids love simple toys that have flashing lights... this is one of them!,"You know it. Your kids love all those toys that have flashing lights and buzzing sounds and are generally obnoxious to you.They're attracted and can't help it.This Spongebob Light Chaser is a total winner in my boook - because it only has the lights, and none of the annoying sounds (ok, a little whizzing sound made by the spinning, but no Spongebob laughing or such). It is simple to operate for your child. Just hold down his arm and it goes. The antennae spin and light up. How simple is that? ANd you kids will love it. A few bucks at the dollar store and your child will be set for quite a bit of bedtime fun.I caught my husband playing with it, too. Nobody can help themselves..."
4,Great multilanguage dictionary,"Great price especially for traveling, I used it for looking up Korean and all the words I wanted to find were there. The speaking part is bad it is very robotic and even hard to understand what it was saying in English let alone another language, but if you can point to the word or say it in the other language you'll be fine. It took me about 15 min to have ease with all the buttons and what they do. **Don't count on the phrase book to help you any - that's bad! I recommend getting a small phrase book and memorizing then when you are traveling and you forget certain words look it up on this dictionary. I even called customer support for a question I had and they were very helpful. Remember to get the speaking part to press the shift button then the speaker button next ( this isn't that clear on the directions) you can press for either language you want."
5,"Not old school, right school",Love the old school look of them and they sound fantastic. I have a huge noggin and they feel fine. They are supposed to be tight by design for all those experts that write about it in the other reviews. Everything is right where it should be without being to high or to bassy. Listened to a Deadmau concert on Netflix and felt like I was there.
1,Sore Head,"I was pleased to find Koss still offered this model. However, when I received the unit, it had some type of two-tone color scheme, including some green, and definitely not all beige, as displayed. In the insert on the display ad, was a model in green, but no way to choose on the order blank. The headphones are very tightfitting and heavy and, after a while, become too uncomfortable to wear. The headband is not flexible. While the sound quality is very good, the tight fit and heavy weight of the headphones is just not worth the listen. When opening the box, the headphones could not be removed without tearing the box. In addition, the process to return the item was extremely difficult to follow. When adding up the cost for returning and restocking, along with the possibility that the damaged item might not be accepted, it was not worth the effort. So, I will try to find someone with a head size smaller than 6 7/8 and give the headphones away.Disappointed in Michigan."
1,not the same Pro4's from the 70's.,These are crap. The output plug went bad in less than a year. I'm not sure what has changed but they are nowhere near as comfortable as the pair I had back on '78. Doesn't matter anyway since the plug no longer works.
5,Just fabulous cans,"Note to potential UK buyers - very diff to get hold of this model in the UK, most shops tending to favour the more modern titanium (T) model. Buying from US works out pretty much the same as UK price even with UPS delivery and import taxes! The delivery was also blisteringly fast - i think it was sent UPS express. Great product, sounds fab plugged right into electric drumkit, phone sockets of various guitar and synth devices and from recording desk. With an adaptor its unbelievably fab for IPods too. Just a simple, chunky, retro set of fabulously good value, great sounding headphones! Warning to parents - teenage sons/daughs may steal these - 13yr old reckons they are cooler than Skullcandy products!! Cheers - S"
4,Great headphones,"Great durable headphones. The weight felt heavy for a while but my neck became accustomed to it after a few days and now I barely notice it. Has good built in sound dampening and great sound. I would give five stars if it came packaged with a quality adapter for use with a small headphone jack, generic adapters don't work great and will cause static and sound loss when barely touched."
5,It was a blessing disguised as a curse.,"Initially, I had accidently ordered the 4aa, but once it arrived I put it on and have never heard Bjork so clearly. If your on the fence about these, Get 'em!"
5,this is what the best american series is all about,"Edward Wilson guest edits the second in the Science and Nature Writing Series, and unlike many of the guest editors in the other Series (like the Best American Short Stories for this year), he does a phenomenal job, and shows us what this series is all about. The essays come from magazines who focus on the general reader rather than the scientist. The essays are informative. They teach the reader quite a bit and point out things that come to a surprise to most of us (such as the state of the earth's water supply). And they do it in an entertaining way. Above all else, the essays collected here are fun to read and not loaded with jargon the layman can't understand. A special note: Bill Joy's essay on technology and our future should be read at least twice and thought on long and hard."
3,Nice book but...,"I liked ALL Richard Kern books, and since, people liking Kern recommend me this one, I decied to take a look. To my sourprise, this book is not that bad (I put 4 * to it) but, it's not comparable (IMHO) to Richard Kern Works. It hasn't that ""je-ne-se-qui"" that all Kern books have. I don't know how to explain it better, but, perhaps, you'll like this album, but in my case, comming from Kern, I found it a little ""poor""..."
5,For Keith Jarrett fans !!!!!!!!!!!,"Bruce Stark explains in the notes inside the front cover how much he loves Keith Jarrett's music and decided to become a professional pianist after listening the Lausane/Bremen concerts at 2 A.M in his campus room in Berkeley... Stark's music sounds a lot like his idol's performances in Cologne (Koln), Bremen, Lausane or Bregenz... Good news!!!"
3,Caution: Burns the eyes,It's creamy and leaves your skin smooth and soft but DO NOT get this stuff near your eyes. It's stings horribly. I just use it as a body soap instead but it gets used up very quickly. Too pricey for what it does. Use Ivory.
2,Not working,"I bought this to help with KP, but it's not really helping. I am using it with Carmol 20 Cream and I haven't seen much improvement. Oh well."
2,Way to large,"If you have difficulty swallowing pills forget these. They are the biggest pills I have ever had. I can barely get them down, I have had to chew them up which is nasty."
4,Short but sweet,"A brief, attractive pamphlet of simple Hawaiian chants and affirmations that can be done for contemplation or relaxation. The author is of Hawaiian heritage and upbringing; on the final page, she shows a typically Hawaiian concern with genealogy, tracing her ancestry back to La'a Uli La'e La'e, primordial oneness. Examples of the techniques are personal incantation chants such as A'u La'a Kea, I am the Sacred Light; also, storing breaths for particular purposes, such as Maluhia, Peace, or Hau Oli, happiness. The affirmations are much the same as in any New Age, positive thinking book, but clothed in the Hawaiian language, they show a new beauty. This is not a theoretical work. Read it if you want to learn a few simple things to practice, practice, practice! By the way, the chant in this book called Ma Kahi Kina E can be heard as track 2 on George Naope's albumNa Mele'o Kawa Kahiko (Chants of Hawaii)."
5,Yummy!,"Order this baklava and it arrived quickly. Everything was sealed tightly and the baklava was fresh and yummy, I love them. The baklava are crispy and they stayed together well, so I barely made any mess taking them out. The baklava didn't have too much honey/syrup on them so they weren't all that sweet (which is just the way I like them), but if you like the sweeter taste you'll need to pour some honey on top."
5,real nice,"finally! every collectors dream.. love the way they made this, it's too expensive for me though, i will have to save money for this.,.,"
3,Poor finishing,"I took advantage of this armoire when the price was right. These are usually expensive. This product is heavy-duty and solid, however, the manufacturer took short-cuts when finishing. There is a gouge right on the front of it and the wood is pieced together, not a solid frame. The finish is smudged especially on the inside. If you want a classy unit this isn't it."
5,Awesome,Excellent choice so I have so much jewelry and no room at all for a floor armoire. Everything at eye level. Well made. Good looking.
2,Sample pages of book are not in this book.....,"I received the book in a timely manner, but thought you should know that the book described on Amazon (with book sample pages) was not the same book that I received. I ordered the Hot Rods & Customs of the 1970's and that is the book that I received, so I guess I cannot complain, but the Amazon site shows a book of sample pages (7 or 8 pages) and none of those pages are in the book that I received. I believe the book shown on the website is actually Andy Southard's ""Hot Rods & Customs of the 1960's.....which is the book that I actually wanted. Someday I will get the other book....the book I received does not have any of the information I was looking for. But....thank you for your prompt service. I will leave a positive feedback for you. Warmest regards, Judee Ransdell"
3,Sets good tone from the start... Bam!,Ratline is a great example of independent and low-budget film making. Deadwood Park and Ratline are the best Eric Stanze Wicked Pixel Cinema films I have seen. Eric Stanze and company get better with each film the produce. Ratline is definitely worth your time delivering an awesome opening 20 minutes and a very interesting albeit complicated plot. The ending whiffs a bit but that should not detract you from giving the film a viewing and enjoying it. Check it out. CouchZombie.com
3,"Gore, boobs and Nazis ? Yes please.","This is schlock horror , legit. Initially a perplexing story line not short on the gore and full frontal nudity.Once you get past the ""just make it up as you go"" Satanic ritual you get an interesting tale of Nazi occultism and peculiar synchronicity.There are some genuinely disturbing moments with and without gore. The acting is decent , nothing horribly awkward, the actress portraying Penny stands out above the rest of the cast, acting far more natural and believable than her fellow thespians ...that and she's ridiculously cute."
1,I didn't get it,"I ordered this kind of pastry and I paid extra 3 bucks to get it ASAP, but I didnt get it the shipment was to a destination very far from where I live not even in the north west of the stats. It's very frustrating."
2,Painless 70217,"I bought this to wire up some HID lights and a stereo system along with some other accessories. When I got this I noticed it had only 7, 10A fuses which do not allow enough current for the items I wanted to install. The gauge of the wiring is way too small also. All the circuits had only 16 gauge wire or maybe smaller. I was flying blind because the fuse size, wire size are not listed on Amazon or the Painless website so people will know what they are buying. You also cannot tell by the picture because it only shows it with the cover on over the fuses."
4,Know what you are doing... Good product,"Painless makes good stuff. The other reviewer here was very helpful giving the exact specs to this product. this fuse box is perfect for my application and I am frantically trying to wire everything up. Nice rubber protective covers come for the circuit breakers. Foc constant hot, I purchased 2x 4 blade fuse holders (clip together and into the painless block) that you can run your own wires from a fused dist block for cheap.Do your wiring correct the first time! Great product."
4,Welcome Back!,"It was great to hear the Tracy Lawrence was coming back. It was equally as nice to hear a little of his old stuff, but wished the cd had more new songs. Tracy sounds as good as ever with his rich voice, and true country style. There is no mistaking he is country. I hope he enjoys his come back and does some touring this year."
5,great overview,"This little book is an excellent review of Central American everything, from the time it emerged from the sea, to the current environmental and social problems affecting the region. The articles are written in almost a chronological order, by experts in their respective fields. The only think I would criticise is that it is too short for such a fascinating topic. Definitely worth the money."
4,Gripping stories with the always likable James Bond!,"This was my first James Bond book, and so I didn't know what to expect. This book is all in all good. ""Octopussy"" is a good story, but, since it is lacking James Bond for most of it, it doesn't have the pace of the others. ""The Living Daylights"" is by far the best, with a suspenseful climax and interesting descriptions of drab Berlin. ""The Property of a Lady"" is not very suspenseful, but it was still a very good read. I am definitely going to read another Fleming soon!"
2,lack of flow,"I am native spanish always looking for spanish novels to read, since English is all a breath in a daily basis. I was watching the ""Novela"" in tele mundo as I started reading this book and was very disapointed to learn that the author of the book did't necessarily gave a smooth flow to the story. it was almost choppy and agressive. Did'nt ejoy it and didn't finish the book. I've always preffer the book over the screen but not this time. If you saw the 'Novela"" don't waste your time reading it.speaker,La Reina del Sur - Media Tie-In / The Queen of the South (Spanish Edition) (Spanish Edition)"
5,BOOK YOU WONT WANT TO PUT DOWN,I loved this book from the minute I got it I have not set it down. Goes to show you how far a woman will go to survive. I love this book and already got two other people hooked on it from just reading the first two pages. I would recommed this book to anyone wanting to read something that will keep there interest alive.
2,Small & Expensive To Make,"After I purchased this item, I said to myself....""Why am I going through all this hassle and expense of making such a small quantity of ice cream when I can just buy a half-gallon of ice cream at the grocery store every week for around $2-$2.50 on sale????"".You will say that to yourself to if you buy this too."
2,beware the batteries !,"DID YOU NOTICE THAT THE TYPE OF BATTERIES USED IN THIS DEVICE IS NEVER GIVEN IN THE DESCRIPTION? IF YOU CAREFULLY SEARCH THE FINE PRINT BELOW ""FEATURES"" YOU WILL SEE ""BATTERIES: 2 C INCLUDED"". THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BATTERIES ARE NOT C BUT CR123A...WHICH ARE LITHIUM AND COST MUCH MORE. IF YOU BUY NAME BRAND BATTERIES OF THIS TYPE THEY COULD COST YOU OVER TEN DOLLARS FOR THE PAIR. YOUR 3 CUPS OF ICE CREAM MAY COST YOU DEARLY...THE UNIT RUNS 3 TO 5 HOURS PER BATCH AND THE BATTERIES ARE BOUND TO BE DEPLETED RUNNING A MOTOR AGAINST RESISTANCE AT ZERO DEGREES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BATTERY LIFE WILL BE...THAT WILL VARY WITH THE BATTERY, THE TEMPERATURE, AND THE INGREDIENTS. I THINK I'LL RETURN MINE."
3,"Tastes great, needs work","pro: tiny, easily fit into our freezer. Tasty results.con: tiny, doesn't make very much. Recipes call for egg yolks (hi cholesterol). You must COOK the recipe before the freezer. Tip: place directly on floor of freezer for best results."
3,"A little boring, but good read all together","The debt collector starts out with a gory crime scene which is done very well. I think the author goes a little overboard in trying to give the characters ""character"". Some of the dialog is just downright corny, but hey, some people like corny. Sonora, our heroine detective does her job well and is a bit on the independent/rebellious side. Unfortunately the killer does not get to go to the electric chair, oops, I shouldn't give that away, but his conclusion is still interesting."
5,Never Trust A Dead Man,"The Book Never Trust A Dead Man, is my favorit book, it has mistery, comedy, and fantisy, all neatly rolled into one great story. Vivian Velde wrote a great story that is why I gave it a five."
3,"quick read, OK overall","I picked this book up for 75 cents at work! I mean, seriously, how can you beat a new paperback for 75 cents? This book is some fantasy, some mystery, and some laughs. The main character, Slwyn, gets convicted of a crime he didn't commit, and loses his girl, all at the same time - sound familiar? The twist is, the dead man helps to prove his innocence. Yup, the dead man comes back to life, in the form of a bat, and later in the form of a songbird. In the end, the murder's been solved, Selwyn is free to live another day, but doesn't get the girl.Not bad for a quick read, I give it 3 stars. Worth reading, but I wouldn't bother reading again.(I am an adult reviewer, not a young adult)"
2,Not as good as promesed !!!,"Actually the device works well once you got it running on XP and only in Simple & Plain XP, but there's NO SUPPORT or Update Drivers for SP2 so actually it has become an obsolete piece of hardware, BTW Belkin SUPPORT SITE ""SUCK'S BIG TIME"" having all those white collar guys and none of them can update or rewrite drivers to work with SP2 , its simply unbeleivable.Dont buy it unless you are sticking with Win 2000 for a long time."
1,Light your incense...,"1 1/2This new age shamanist journey into the desert is, dare I say, dull, and certainly not without better articulation elsewhere- even from the same artist."
4,Unique in the musical universe,"This album answers the question, what kind of music would you get if neandertal man had synthesizers? I imagine cavemen huddling next to a cliff overlooking a vast plain, playing to appease their gods, trying to make some sense out the universe they barely comprehend."
3,A Good Effort With Some Memorable Characters,"I enjoyed this book for its characterizations and writing rhythm. I would have to give it a middle of the road review as I felt some of the plotting was unnecessarily contrived. Overall, a worthy read.I'd also like to especially recommend the absolutely best book I've read in the past few years...""Anna's Trinity"" by Howard Cobiskey."
2,Slow paced,I have been a fan of Laurens for sometime now and was very disappointed in this book infact the last 3-4 of her books. Very slow paced. Not very interesting. I think I will take a break from her books if they stay on this path.
2,PREDICTABLE,A fine read. Too predictable. Love the main characters. This is the second book that I have read by this author.
4,Pretty good Laurens,"If you've ever read any of Stephanie Laurens' books, you know what to expect. This is one of the better ones, with a fairly decent story to prop up the sex scenes."
1,Might as well make your own,"These diapers are horrible. All they do is leak, they don't fit well at all, and are the worst diapers I have ever purchased. I thought that I would try them because they were on sale and since they were Huggies I figured they couldn't be so bad but I WAS WRONG THESE DIAPERS SUCK! Dish out the extra bucks and get pampers which are great! they fit comfortably, they don't fall off like huggies (which fall off no matter how tighly you put them) and they don't leak, my son loves them and he is a wiggler(8 months and crawling strong!) and they are really soft. huggies has def. made a permanent pampers customer out of me! it's pampers for me wipes and diapers all the way! they have the best products out there hands down...hopes this helps you mommies out there and good luck with your little ones :-)"
1,Huggies is horrible comparing to Pampers or Luv,"I've always been using Pampers for my daughter, never had a single leak incident. After I switched to Huggies, half the time, I get a leak in the morning, and wet the bed sheet. The Huggies just won't hold enough comparing to Pampers or Luv. Now I use pampers at night, and Huggies in the morning, so I can use up the remaining box. Will never buy Huggies again."
1,$24.50 Shipping! You've got to be kidding me.,"$24.99 is a great price, but by the time you pay shipping, you're paying almost $50.00. Why buy economy sizes for double the stated price? There's really no sense in it.This merchant may charge $24.50 regardless of the size of the order, but you'd have to buy an awful lot from them to make it worthwhile. Maybe you could buy diapers for the year - but I can do better for my money than investing in truckloads of diapers to save on shipping costs."
1,bad package,"I got this package today...The box was damaged very much. I am disappointed with the service, what amazon/ups provided."
5,Does the job!,"Huggies diapers do the job... everything is contained with very infrequent leaking. As other posters have said, make sure to ""unfold"" the diaper before putting it on your baby by stretching the elastic band."
4,very pleased,"I have been ordering diapers through Amazon for a while and so far I'm very pleased with the product and the service. I did notice a couple of diapers with something like glue on them in the case I received recently. It's on the inside of the diapers so I wasn't able to use them :(But overall, I love to shop for diapers this way. It's less than buying them at the stores and they are delivered right to your door!"
5,Good diapers best price here,Love huggies. Especially that they are perfume free. I still use baby naturecare at night since they are chlorine free.
1,Baby waking up wet in the middle of the night!,"I have been buying these diapers for a few months now and for some reason, this last box seems to have terrible quality control. Some diapers are smaller than others and my baby has been waking up in the middle of the night completely wet! The size is right according to the package so since my baby didn't change, I guess the diapers did!"
4,We like Huggies diapers,We get a pretty good deal though Amazon Mom so these diapers are worth it. We have never had issue with the quality of Huggins diapers.
5,A Blessing,This is the third diaper brand I have purchased and I have to say that I am completely happy with them. With the pampers swaddlers he used to leak poo. With the Huggies Snugglers he used to leak pee. With these snug and drys he doesn't leak at all. Most of the time I forget he has a diaper on. Believe me this is not a waste of money. You can push these diapers to the limit and back.
2,i prefer pampers baby dry,"these diapers are more expensive than pampers with way less in the box and i haveno idea why that is, pampers are much better and these dont even have tabs on the sides where the velcro sticks so that the velcro tab doesnt rub against the babys skin and irritate it, i think that its insane to charge so much more for these diapers than pampers or luvs even because they are both far superior to these,i would not reccommend these to anyone."
4,did my baby change shape?,"I've used Huggies diapers with 3 kids because they fit better than the other big brand, being ""baby-shaped."" However, the last two boxes from amazon have been rectangular. They still claim to be baby shaped, but the shape of my son hasn't changed and the diapers have. They still cover his hiney and absorb the same."
4,Love Huggies + Subscribe & Save program!,"Using Pampers with our first son, we changed to Huggies by six months due to leakage & sizing. We started son #2 with Huggies from the start and have never had an issue. I am a diaper changing fanatic, though, not leaving a diaper one for more than a couple of hours. We use Amazon subscribe and save and it's great! We don't have Costco as another mentioned, so I can only go on comparisons to Walmart, Meijer, Sam's Club and the likes. Pricing and convenience is a winner! We save money and don't have to rush out to buy diapers because we always know a supply is on it's way and the progam is so flexible - we've bumped up delivery dates without a problem. I recommend Huggies and the Subscribe and Save program!"
4,Good Diapers... Not such a good deal,"I bought the diapers in the volume I did so hat i could recieve the ""$30"" certificate. The email never came with the Certificate Code. The diapers are good, and about the same price that I could have gotten at a warehouse club, but the cert. would have made them a good deal."
2,Faulty batch of diapers,"We have been ordering diapers for over a year. The current boxes we are using have has over a dozen diapers with missing tabs. The latest package had 4 diapers in a row missing a tab. I realize this is a better price than we can purchase the diapers in the store, but I have come to expect a high level of quality from Amazon that is missing from this purchase. We will be closely monitoring our next shipment and it is this poor again, we will be canceling our order. With 2 kids in diapers this is a HUGE deal!"
2,Not as good as Snugglers. Leaks!,"We have tried several brands of diapers and different styles within the line from Pampers Swaddlers, Swaddlers Sensitive, Huggies Little Snugglers, Luvs, Kirkland and now these, Huggies Snug and Dry. Our favorites so far have been the Swaddlers Sensitive and Little Snugglers because it had the softest, cushiony quilt but they don't make them in size 3 and up. The Huggies Little Snugglers run a bit smaller than the Pampers Swaddlers. We've had rear blow-outs with all of these at one point or another but we've had the most with these Sung and Dry ones. The inner fabric doesn't seem to be as thick or as absorbent as the Little Snugglers and it is definitely not as well fitted. For breastfed babies whose poop is more runny, these don't work. They don't absorb fast enough and ends up leaking through the back when you lay baby down to change. Now we are off to try the Pure and Natural which a friend says is much better fitted and cushioned."
2,Lots of Leaks,"I was very disappointed with Huggies. They leaked about half the time. I compared it with a Luvs and a Pampers diaper and found that the Huggies diaper is narrower. Fine for some babies I guess but not mine, and she's a very average sized kid."
2,"Not the ""New and Improved""","The diapers I received had single ""gatherers"" vs. the double gatherers on the Huggies I've been getting from Costco for over the past year. I suspect this means Amazon is shipping the old stock."
1,Not worth waiting 2 months...,"I placed an order for these diapers on the 28th of February. On the 21st of March I got an e-mail stating there was a problem fulfilling the order. The website tells me that the order should ship between April 15th and 24th. That makes it a 7-8 week delivery time. Sam's Club has the same item in stock for $29.88, so I won't be making this mistake again."
2,Huggies,"The straps are rough and cause irritation to the baby skin. Overall softness is unsatisfactory. When we have used it overnight, it smells. I understand that diapers smell when soiled but this has a very distinct odor."
1,What happened to Huggies?,I used to only use Huggies for my newborn because they were the only ones that didn't leak with newborn poop. Something has changed from my last baby to this one. They are almost guaranteed to leak every time she goes. I am very disappointed in them. I wish they would go back to their old design.
2,What happened to Huggies???,"I have been using Huggies since my first son was born 7 years ago and have loved them! Great fit and at a great price from Amazon. A friend, who also buys hers from Amazon, warned me she was having issues with the new style and I should've listened. The night we opened the new box, my son leaked out onto his PJs by the time morning rolled around...and has every night since. Some nights I have had to change my 2 y/o in the middle of the night because his jammies are so wet. The diaper won't even be completely wet, yet it leaks. We never used to have this problem and I am extremely disappointed. I haven't noticed staining from the dye...yet. I guess I'll have to examine his clothes more closely. What the heck, Huggies??? I'll be writing the company directly as well, this is just ridiculous."
4,great daytime diapers,"I choose these diapers over any other brands for daytime use. The waistband along the back keeps messiness IN the diaper! I prefer to use Huggies Little Snugglers or Little Movers for nighttime because they fit better around the legs, but these are great for daytime use when they are changed regularly."
2,Disappointed...,"I've been ordering Huggies Step 4 (Economy Pack) from Amazon since arriving in US. During a recent offer, I ordered 3 boxes. The quality of diapers is the worst I've ever used. So far, 2 diapers had been defective - the snap on came off when I put on the diaper on my child. Also, the material is different from what you would get if you buy those smaller size pack from grocery stores."
1,disappointed,"I tried these based on a sample that my neighbor rec'vd in the mail and gave me to try. I'm not sure if these are the same as that sample because it was over the summer. HOWEVER, these are called ""snug & dry""..... Prior to these I have been using Pampers cruisers(I was very happy with those), the only reason I changed is because the price went up and, like a fool I was trying to save a few dollars. These don't keep my little girl dry at all. They smell and I'm very disappointed. I wish I would've just stayed with the cruisers."
2,weird dye issue,"We have used Huggies almost exclusively for nearly 2 years now. Unfortunately, I'm about to cancel my delivery subscription and switch brands. The past two shipments have both caused color transfer from the diaper to my son's thighs. Quite literally, the blue decorative stripe of color around the legs is rubbing off and discoloring my son's legs. This and some of the general green color combines into this god aweful bruise like color. The first time I noticed it, I nearly had a heart attack thinking my daycare center had caused horrible deep bruises on my son's legs. The daycare center thought the same thing about me. We are chuckling about it now that we realize it washes off with soap and water - but I won't be buying diapers that stain my child's skin. I don't know what Huggies changed, but it is unfortunate. They have lost a customer because of it."
2,I prefer Pampers over Huggies,"I purchased these Huggies diapers to see how they compare to Pampers, and I must say, that I prefer Pampers. They are much softer and better absorbing."
3,Huggies Baby-Shaped diapers are just OK,"My little girl is tall and slim for her age. I find these diapers to be mediocre. She cannot wear them overnight, nor has she been able to wear them overnight since about 4 months of age. If I accidentally put her to bed in these diapers I am sure to have leakage come morning. My order of preference for daytime diapers:1. Pampers2. Luv's3. Huggies Baby-Shaped4. Off brand (never bought again after trying Dri Bottoms)I do like the Huggies Supreme for overnight use, but they are too expensive for all day use. If you can find Pampers on sale and have a coupon, I'd go that route."
4,never had an overnight leak,"These do the job and they're always cheaper than pampers. They aren't as soft as pampers, but the definitly get the job done!"
5,My Favorite Diapers,I have NEVER had Huggies leak on me. My son who has sensitive skin and gets rashes easily never has a problem with these. Once in a pinch I bought Pampers brand and within 2 hrs he had the worst rash. Would highly recommend these.
5,Awesome Diaper!,"No more leaks! These diapers are great for everyday use and will hold for up to 6 hours if necessary during travel. I tried the Fisher Price diapers for a while, but am not nearly as impressed. Huggies snug and dry have a good fit and with the subscribe and save with Amazon Mom, they're at a price that Walmart can't even beat.For night time, I use the Huggies Overnights. I put these on my babies just before bedtime and use the snug and dry during the day and have no complaints. This is an excellent, inexpensive way to go and I don't have extra laundry to do because of leaky diapers."
2,Diaper fits fine but ink from picture is rubbing off,"Huggies seem to fit best on my little chubby baby, but for some reason I noticed that the ink from the picture on the diaper is rubbing off onto her clothes. Not sure if this issue is specific to Snug & Dry or just to this batch. Disappointed but at least the diapers still work fine. Fortunately the ink is only leaving an impression on the inside of her clothes."
2,Not for size 2 babies!,"Why does Huggies try to market a ""size 1/2"" diaper? Especially since every diaper is stamped with a ""1""? And they all fit exactly like a 1? These are fine if your baby is a true size 1, but when I bought them (right at the tail end of my son being able to wear a 1, just getting into a 2) they were too small. I had to buy size 2's in smaller packages at the supermarket. The warehouse clubs by me all offer these ""size 1/2"" diapers.Otherwise as far as Huggies diapers in general are concerned, Huggies are fine for some babies. Babies do come in different shapes; a diaper that is perfect on one baby will cause leaks on another. It's hard to judge the general quality of a diaper based on a review. You really should buy a new brand of diaper in a smaller package to make sure it's going to work for your baby before you buy huge economy sized packages."
2,Leaks!,"We bought several brands before my daughter arrived thinking we'd try different brands to see what we liked. I had bought 3 packs of Huggies because they seemed so popular they must be good...right? We had several leaks just in the one pack. We used them up as not to waste money, but they leaked out the side of the legs. We took the other 2 packs back. I highly recommend Luvs, Target brand, or BabiesRUs Supreme."
4,Huge Improvement,"So far these diapers have been absolutely fantastic. Compared to some of the other products available, they're very low profile, and have an above average absorbency. For some reason the pampers were causing a lot of skin irritation, which was leading to a lot of night time crying that was making it impossible to sleep. Since making the switch to huggies, the crying has almost completely stopped. I wish they were a little bit bigger, but I suppose the tradeoff is that they might be obvious to strangers as I generally wear fitted jeans."
2,Not for newborns!,"These diapers were way too harsh for my 6 week old. They chafed and irritated her skin. On the plus side, they rarely leaked. I would recommend spending the extra money and buying the supreme care with cuddleweave for younger babies."
2,Stinky,While the price was right for the product. I did not like the Huggies at all. They felt rough to the touch and the baby smelt REALLY bad as soon as he peed. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the price was right
3,so so,"These diapers aren't bad but the quality is not the best either. They are made different from the ones I bought in the store. If you look at the print on the front they are badly printed (lots of little dots on the image) which is not a big deal but the inside lining is different too, it is blue instead of white. We didn't even make it through the whole box because after about 2/3 the way through my son started having major blowouts out the sides and up his back so we moved up to size 2 diapers and that fixed the problem. The diapers aren't bad but I wish they were the same quality as those in store."
1,These diapers are horrible!!,"I usually buy Huggies Little Movers for my 1 & 2 year old. They are wonderful. Well Amazon was out of stock of the Little Movers, so I bought these Snug & Dry. HORRIBLE. They have leaked out of them constantly, they don't hold much at nighttime, the ""velcro"" tabs won't stay shut, they fall off when my kids are too active...they are just bad. I will never buy them again!"
3,"Keeps dry, but isn't soft. Feels rough like paper.","Now that my son is moving more, I switched from Pampers to Huggies. Pampers are more comfortable and softer, but don't hold up as well to movement and tend to leak. Huggies snug n dry keeps everything in the diaper, but feel uncomfortable. They remind me of a paper grocery bag. Little movers are softer, but don't work as well."
3,Just Ok,"I purchsed these because they were cheaper than the little snugglers, but in the future I'm going to shell out the extra cash for the other ones. These diapers worked just fine but they don't have the pocket on the top of the back to catch the poop from going up the back. It seems like everytime our little one poops it's up her back these days and that is only since we switched to these diapers. Other than that one problem, I like the diapers. They fit well and have good absobancy. They also don't smell horrible with fragrance."
4,Good Diaper,We have switched to these from the little snugglers when we moved to size 3. Not as soft as the little snugglers but good diapers that do not leak.
3,Lots of Leaks,"These are okay, but they leaked allot more than pampers. I don't think I will buy this style of Huggies again."
5,best absorbing diapers!,I tried all the diapers that are out there BUT Huggies are the only ones i trust and love. I've used Huggies for both kids and wouldn't want it any other way. They stay dry with no leakage and they dont bulk up. Who could ask for a better diaper!
2,Disappointing,"After really loving Huggies Little Snugglers, I thought I would give these a shot once my daughter needed size 3 diapers. They're cheaper than moving on to the ""Little Movers"" and I liked the convenience of Amazon Mom. With the 30% discount they rivaled target generics in price (my favorite diapers ever).Well, these diapers suck. Unfolding them is difficult because they are so stuck on themselves that it's actually tricky to open them up before using them! Several of them have structural integrity issues such that the little gel beads are easily escaping out of the diaper (there are holes in the paper that they are getting through).Tonight as I had another issue with them I decided that I would just use up what I had and switch back to the target brand. Yeah, now I won't have them automatically show up on my doorstep, which I did love. But these diapers are crap for the price when you compare to some of the great generics out there."
4,Decent Diapers,We like Huggies generally (although at night we prefer Pampers night-time diapers; they seem to last the night a LOT better. Our son was waking up soaking wet almost every night with the Huggies diapers) and using Amazon moms 30%-off discount it's hard to find a better deal on diapers.
4,They are good...,They are good diapers in all the brands which tried for little 14 months old kid. No rashes or no complains from my kid.Good product!!!
2,Cheap elastic - leaky diaper,These diapers have cheap elastic and do not hold the poop in. We constantly had blowouts and messes to clean up.
3,Not for chubby babies,"I prefer huggies over pampers because they ""breath"" better. But my baby is a chubby one and huggies have small waistbands. I have to opt for the larger size. Also, the tabs pull off sometimes. That's why I often use the Kirkland signature diapers from Costco instead."
2,They Don't compare to swaddlers and snugglers,Not so much a fan of these diapers.At first I thought it was only because I had been using swaddlers and snugglers (a much softer diaper for such a tiny baby) and I was disappointed when I realized the snug n dry was not the same texture. But then I noticed a TON of blowouts. My husband and I went on a two week trip and we bought the pampers size 2 while we were gone and didn't have a single blow out. We came home and tried size 3 of the snug and dry (since i had heard a lot of blowouts typically means its time to change diaper sizes) and we were back to major blowouts with my daughter.
1,Hate Huggies!,"These are truly terrible. I've tried numerous brands including Pampers, Target, and Kirkland (Costco brand) and Huggies are by far the worst offenders when it comes to leaks, usually on the backside. Even when fastened tightly, they sag quickly which causes leaks. My preferred brands are Pampers (on the expensive side) and the Target brand (inexpensive and keep baby dry throughout the night)."
1,The new versions LEAKS,"Always loved Huggies ,but the ones with the bigger/brighter Mickey designs always left me leaky and wet diapers!! It's extremely frustrating. I'm switching to something else."
5,great......,Huggies Snug N Dry Mainline Value Pack Size: 1-2Diapers work great for my daughter.Amazon mom seems to have a best price ever.i loved this product...
1,Print Dye Comes Off On Clothes And Skin,"These diapers do the job just fine as any other diaper would, but the color from the print dye comes off on baby's clothes and skin. The colors are so strong that they ruin clothes permanently -- they do not come off in the wash again. And who knows what's in them that gets absorbed by the baby's skin."
1,Bad Diaper Rash - Don't buy,I recently decided to switch to Huggies for my 19 month old since the Pampers one fit her weird. But unfortunately the diapers caused a bad rash within hours of her wearing the diapers - she kept complaining of some itchiness down there and we ignored it in the beginning only to find her skin red bruise like later. I am going to stick to Pampers as they atleast are better quality!!
2,Diapers leak--they do not absorb evenly,"These diapers are quite roomy and the design (it ""cups"" the bottom and the leg area, which I guess is an attempt to keep moisture from leaking which doesn't work in my opinion) is a good concept. However, my major complaint is that the wetness is not absorbed evenly; it is mainly absorbed at the front of the diaper, which creates a big lump on her front side, and the rest of the diapers is practically dry. This causes the wetness to work its way up and leak through the front and sides of her clothes.Another issue I have is the adhesive on the diaper. Apparently, Huggies makes the adhesive to only be used once. What I mean is that when you remove the straps to check to see if the diaper needs to be changed or not, the straps will not stick back on well, which causes leakage every where else such as the back and in the leg area because the diaper eventually loosens up as she moves. I think I'll switch back to Pampers and see how that works out."
3,diapers,More expensive than the store. If you buy them at Sam's you get more diapers for the same amount of money.
5,Huggies are the best,"I bought these for my sister. Although she hasnt used them yet, Im sure they will be great. When my kids were small all I would use is Huggies. Ive never hand a leak using Huggies. Ive tried other brands and none held up. I would never use another brand."
1,Ink rubs off on my child's skin!,"We've used Huggies for ages and they were always the solid white ones with one small image in the front and (I think) a second very small image in the back. We signed up for the subscribe-and-save and every box is now this new version of the diapers -- it has blue and green circles all over it, even between the legs. I could completely care less what the diaper looked like, except that this ink rubs off all over my daughter's thighs! She looks like she has massive bruises! It doesn't come off easily either. I'm so disappointed Huggies! I'm canceling this subscribe-and-save and I guess I'll move over to Pampers."
2,Size 5 causes pimple like bumps....,"I always use Huggies because I can't stand the strong odor I get from Pampers and everything's been great, but it seems like the last two boxes I've received from Amazon has caused weird pimple like bumps on my daughter. All the way up to her belly button. Has Huggies changed again? She's never had this problem until she moved into the bigger size.. Other than the rash, I always love the fit and no leaks.Plan on trying a different brand since I can allow my baby to have those itchy uncomfortable bumps :("
4,change your toddler less!,"Been on the search for diapers that don't leak overnight and these are it! My son is now 14mos using size 4. We've struggled finding the perfect diaper. I will admit, Huggies didn't work for us when he was born so we were using Pampers Swaddlers from when he was born up to size 2 (thought these were perfect), then struggled with finding the ""perfect"" diaper in between sizes 2-3, then finally settled with Huggies at Size 4 because it held his leaks overnight the best. These work better than even the overnight diapers. Also, he doesn't have to be changed so often compared to diapers like Pampers or Kirkland brands. My son has chubby thighs and these prevent leaks as long as it's not overflowing with urine!I will not go back... i'm subscribed with these coming every month or so. Happy MOM to a clean and dry toddler boy!"
3,Newer design not as good,"I used to love these diapers. They fit our son great (he is 50th percentile height, 20th percentile weight). They actually fit him better than the little movers since he was so thin, they are a little more snug around the legs than littler movers or pampers (we get leaks with pampers, I think due to his body shape). However, the most recent shipment was a slightly different design (tabs were square edges not rounded, material felt a little different, more papery) and we had several diapers rip, and several where the tabs just came off when we were trying to put the diaper on. (It wasn't a ton, but 15 or so out of the 156 count box is more than I am okay with). I'm not sure if it is a permanent change to the diaper design or if we just received a bad batch."
4,One of the best diapers for the price,"Apart from Huggies, I have used Pampers a lot, earth's best, Kirkland diapers. While Pampers Cruisers are really good in being leak-proof, they were not fitting well for my lean but tall baby. Then I went on to try others. Kirkland's are really soft and have nice fit for size 3 very much comparable to Huggies.Earth's best was so expensive with the ""green"" thing and wasn't working on my budget even though they are so leak-proof.Huggies through Amazon came out just fine with the fit, holding for 10-hr, soft and the design. With being Amazon-mom, I get the best price for these diapers as well."
2,Huggies just don't work as well for us,"We should have known...we'll be sticking with Pampers. For some reason, Huggies run small and narrow in size and aren't as thick as pampers.We'll use these (since we got on super sale) but if you're a pampers person, don't be cheap and go for huggies when they're on sale. The two brands are SO different."
5,Diapers,"We always get our diapers from Huggies. Have will all 3 kids. They are the best! We have never had any shipping issues on here, either. Always get a good deal."
4,Diapers review,Everything was great other than the constantly increasing prices which got aggravating. But other than that it was great and came on time
3,didn't fit snugly at the bottom,"The diaper didn't fit snugly at the bottom. It caused my baby to get creases and a sore bottom from too much diaper. She fit the waist size. The absorbency was fine, but they didn't seem comfortable. I will stick with the other major brand of diapers instead."
3,Too big,"In my small apartment, this box was way too big. The picture made it seem smaller. Not the biggest issue though...The diapers themselves are great with minimal leaks."
3,Not the best leak protection,"By the time my son is wearing a size 4 diapers, leak protections isn't the biggest concern, however they just do not prevent leaks anything like Pampers. I have a child also in a size 3 and notice the leaks in the Huggies all the time, and therefore won't use them unless absolutely out of others. They appear to be a nice comfortable diaper, but they do definitely leak."
2,Buy Pampers!,"Decided to order these as they were slightly cheaper than the Pampers and we'd used the newborn Huggies at the hospital and liked them okay. These are nothing like those! They are papery feeling, really rough and scratchy and yet plasticky, they hardly breathe at all. They're somewhere between generic diapers and Pampers, although closer to generics. They work, but I hate putting her in them and refuse to put her in them overnight. I can't even imagine the damage they'd do to crawlers!"
1,Huggies Changed the Design,Huggies changed their design and these diapers leak all the time. The absorbent fill material inside the diaper bunches up and the pee leaks right through! I was so happy with the Snug & Dry before they changed them.
5,Great Diapers!,"We've used these diapers for a while when Amazon Mom made these a great deal.Prior, we used Target brand diapers. When the prices went up through Amazon we purchased a box of Target Diapers and immediately noticed the smell with them.We haven't finished the Target box and bought another box of Huggies. We will stick to these. No smell at all, and never any leaks (though we didn't have any leaks with Target ones either)."
1,Worst ever..,I despise these diapers! They give my daughter horrible rashes. I love Huggies but these don't seem to be the same quality as the Little Movers and Little Snugglers.
2,Need to Know Your Crowd,"We played this with some out of town visitors and I didn't rank it very high. I was sort of disappointed. I think I would have liked it better if you could fill in your answer like on the Newlywed game instead of being stuck with their list. Too often it was too simplistic (teenager is a sports car!, Mom likes chocolate!) or no answers were close. But after reading other reviews, I see that the people who love the game were playing with people in their households who really know each other. We were playing with children from out of town too. I'll try it again, but I think the key is to play with your close friends and family. It definitely leads to lots of discussion."
3,Sometimes good . . .,"Just played ""Apples to Apples"" last night, which, IMO, is a much better game (on a similar theme) and helps me to see what's wrong with Imaginiff. Imaginiff can be a lot of fun, especially, as others have mentioned, in a group where you know each other well. I agree with the review that suggests it can be unfun when younger players are involved. Also, the choices often seem arbitrary, unrevealing and without the nuance that might make them truly enlightening or amusing."
2,Not a great game for young adults!,"I bought this game last year for my brother and I was pretty disappointed. I read the reviews on this site, and used them to help me make my decision but after we had played this for about 30 minutes we were all really bored, and I was embarrassed I had picked out such a crummy gift! I think it might be fun for young kids or for parents to play with their young kids, but there really isn't enough excitement to keep a group of young adults entertained!"
1,Horible & Boring!,This is a horrible game that my brother got for his birthday! I've never played such a boring game!
4,iMAgiNiff...every day could be this fun!,"I found this at Toys R Us one day, then that Christmas, got it as a gift from a friend. Boy, she knows me well, eh? (^_^) It's a wild game, offering you zany choices for the person. We all anjoyed playing this greatly, and when there weren't 8 players, they tell you to just add names to the circle of choices. At times our offerings were Bill Clinton, Barney the Dinosaur and random players' family members or pets. The only recurring problem we seemed to have was that some of the choices just never fit the person in question, no matter how hard we tried to fit them. If not for that, I'd have given it a 5."
5,A great game to play with family and friends!,"This is a really fun game to play with your family or friends you are close to. It does not test your knowledge of anything except each other and how well you know what other people will think of that person too. It's a great game for people not looking for competition, but for a fun way to spark interesting conversations. If you are playing with new people or just to change the game, you can throw in celebrities or famous people and see what everyone thinks they are like."
1,Not suitable for winter climes,"I live in an area that get snow and where the roads get salted. I purchased this frame exactly 41 days ago and it got pitted in short order. I returned it and am now ordering the same frame in chromed plastic, which is what I should have done in the first place."
4,"Cruiser Accessories 20630 Nouveau, Chrome","This frame is good quality and has a nice look. I did not want a frame with the name of car on the frame and the dealer frame looked tacky. I wanted a nice simple frame that compliments my car. This frame meets those requirements. I did not give it a 5 star because I did not know the screw covers would not fit the screws I already used with the license plate. If you want to use screw covers, you need to purchase the screws with the frame."
5,"Great Quality, Great Value","I bought this mouse to replace my broken Dell Optical Mouse. I have been using this mouse for four months. The response and comfort is excellent. Make sure you download the latest Logitech software for this mouse to use all the features of the mouse. After you install the software, adjust the pointer settings. I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit."
2,No Good Under Win-7,The mouse is nicely built but Logitech's configuration software which allows features like 'tilt wheel' and zoom will not install under windows 7. Best to purchase a mouse made by Microsoft if you intend to run Win7.
1,Not for big hands or long fingers,PROS: a little stylish. shiny...CONS: 1 star if you have big hands or long fingers. it's not comfortable at all. i can't speak for people with other types of fingers though.
2,BOOK IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED,"Okay. First of all this is a reprint of a guide that was first published in Britain that does not seem to have been edited for American publication. Secondly, there are mistakes--pick your favorite series and browse and you'll find some--I did (in the SPACE:1999 section if you must know.) Also, each show is kind of reviewed but individual episodes are NOT reviewed, which was not the impression I got from the TV commercial. And there is even a British series that the channel shows (MONSTERS) that is not listed. Now, if you were the sci fi channel, wouldn't you at least make sure every show that you broadcast was in the book?? Now, I gave the book 2 stars because it does have an awful lot of info in one convenient place. Still, I would recommend that anyone interested in this LOOKS at it first. Don't buy it sight unseen. And remember that british opinions on series do not always match american opinions."
3,Way oversized,"I purchased this robe thinking that with ""lightweight"" in the description it wouldn't be so bulky and hot, but I was wrong - very bulky and very hot. I bought a large - I am 5'10 and nine months pregnant and was still swimming in this robe. It is sized way too big, the shoulder seam was midway down my upper arm and I have fairly broad shoulders. The color (mint/sage, whatever they call it) was great though and the length was good for me being so tall - it hit about mid shin. It is definitely not the right type of robe if you want to throw it on while still wet out of the shower or tub, it won't help to dry you at all like terry cloth would. It was kind of uncomfortable when put on if you're wet."
2,Stays put but is very scratchy...,"If you are looking for a sheet that stays put on your mattress then this sheet set will serve your purpose, BUT, if you also want a sheet set that is soft you need to look elsewhere.The sheets feel very soft when you first remove them from the package but after one wash (following the instructions) they come out very stiff and scratchy. These sheets don't feel like 300 count...or even a 180 thread count. I am very disappointed."
5,So comfy!!!,"These sheets have served us well for the past four years. They feel very smooth and comfortable on the skin. Despite getting sheets with ""deep pockets"", these barely stretch over the corners of our Sealy pillowtop mattress, but I suppose that's to be expected with a mattress that has such extra volume. We bought these in the ""regal"" (deep purple) color, and the color hasn't changed a bit. We'd definitely buy another set in the future."
1,Don't do it!,Sheets pill after a few washings! Top sheet is not oversized enough to tuck in; all around a big disappointment!
4,"Great Sheets, A Little Small","I ordered 3 sets of the Sealy Best Fit sheets. I found that they're great sheets, they wash and wear well. If you take them out of the dryer right away there isn't much wrinkeling. My only complaint is that they don't fit all the way around the mattress well. If a couple of inchs could be added it would be perfect."
3,Snow Rake,"I received my snow rake in a box that opened during shipment. No tape on the box at either end with metal parts inside that tore open the box. As I accepted it from UPS the opposite end opened as well.There are no directions inside on how to assemble the unit (if they were there they were lost for want a of piece of tape on the ends).It does assemble fairly easy, but instructions would ensure it is correct.There were two plastic ""Spools"" that I didn't realize where they went until seeing the photo. They are offsets to lift it from the roof's surface. They were the only left over parts, though. Time to see how to attach them.We had heavy snows a week ago. It did very well in removing the snow, has a very long reach. Use care around overhead wires AND with your shingles. You do not want to hook a shingle by accident.Would change the rating to four stars if the site would allow me."
3,"Interesting, complex read","I know the author and came to read this book as a result. I believe this book is a worthwhile read, though not an earth-shattering one. A very tight book, this work is good for a fast read over a weekend. The concept of a woman-dominated society entrenched in rural Ohio in the late 60s is a fascinating one; the narrator Scott, an eleven-year-old boy, describes that society from a place of innocence. This book provides an interesting alternate reality that helps us evaluate the place and psychology of women and men in our own society more closely. Mr. Smith has a fine, spare writing style that does an excellent job of evoking the stark, plodding pace of life in rural Ohio."
3,Williamson's First Outing with Ringo: Okay...,"Mad Mike Williamson followed a terrific first novel (Freehold) with a collaboration with John Ringo that is only so-so. It suffers from the old Hawaiian disease lakaeditin and should be about 100 pages shorter. There was a terrific opportunity to delve further into the psychology and physiology of the Darhel, hereditary enemies (maybe) of humanity, aka the Elves, and it was a little disappointing to see how superficially Williamson and Ringo treated it. Overall, the book was good, just not up to Williamson or Ringo's previous best."
4,excellent for classroom,"I teach creative nonfiction writing to college freshman and find it difficult to find books with which they identify. They like the young point of view in this book and I like that it's well-written. We always have a good discussion about life, aspirations, and optimists vs. pessimists."
4,"A meloncholy remembrance of childhood, a good read","This bittersweet tale of a boy who wanted to be a shaolin monk, after watching a TV series, is great. Truly memorable, from his stories of ink brush painting to Kung Fu, what is most striking is that Mark Saltzman captures the simplicity of vision of growing up in complicated circumstances. He is at the top of his craft, and I would find it hard not to be moved by his tale of childhood, his father, and friends who enter and leave his life.I highly recommend this book, for an enjoyable and reflective read, especially on a sunny or rainy afternoon.Well done!"
3,"Coming-of-age novel, lite.","Growing up in the suburbs can be cruel, tough, weird, and it generally takes too long. Salzman's coming of age story shortens the agony into less than 300 pages of well-told, self-deprecating vignettes. The reader can wince, smile and stay safely on the outside.Salzman's writing is not powerful enough to draw the reader in, but it is true enough to keep the reader interested. It has the same detached, keep-your-distance feel as ""Lying Awake,"" which Salzman did better to avoided in ""Iron and Silk"" and ""The Soloist.""Some of his stories have no conclusion or point, but they don't seem to need one. Witnessing the sometimes wrenching transition of boy to almost-man is a satisfaction in itself."
2,where are the bubbles??,Very strange product! Produces almost no foam/bubbles! After 5 minutes in the bath there were no bubbles left at all - just very cloudy bathwater.
1,"no bubbles, scent provokes stress",I didn't like this at all! The scent is terrible and not relaxing at all. It also didn't bubble at all. It didn't moisturize my skin either. I left the bath feeling more stressed for having had wasted my money on this product. Smell it before you buy it and expect a bubble-less bath.
3,THIS IS RIDICULOUS,"THE BUBBLES ARE INSUFFICIENTSeriously, there aren't enough bubbles. If you put about a tablespoon of this stuff in, they last about 60 seconds and then you're left with this wonderful, luxurious bath, but it's neither foamy nor bubbly. But you'll smell really good and feel great for a the duration of the bath. But no foam!Still a good product for stress relief and skin care, but not really a bubble bath. I'll buy it again, but not for bubble baths."
2,not good with house keeping,"I was reading the 2nd chapter where the math appeared the first time in the book. On Page 37, the equation #'s are completely messed up! For example, on Page 37, the author is referring to Equation (2.6): Where the hell is Equation (2.6) up to this page?! Of course, I am smart enough to figure out that it's actually referring to Equation (2.5).Another detail: on Page 28 (Section 2.2), the 2nd bullet point. Here is TWO original quotes from this page.ONE: ""The price of a commodity and its volatility are positively correlated...""Two: ""We will call the inverse leverage effect the negative relationship between commodity prices and their volatility.""So what's the relationship between commodity prices and their volatility? Acoording to ONE, they are POSITIVELY correlated; however, by TWO, they have a negative relationship.Does it take TWO PhDs to make mistakes like those above? (I am wondering how did she do her PhDs. It would be fun to read her thesis)"
2,Boring,I kept wondering why I was still reading this book. I usually read a book in 2 days. It took me a week to finish it. There really was nothing to look forward to or wonder about in this book.
2,"Can you say ""edit""?","After purchasing this book to prepare for the corresponding Oracle certification exam, I was extremely disappointed to find I had purchased a book that had seemingly bypassed the editor's desk. In addition to grammatical and syntax errors, there are a significant number of logical errors that only aid in reducing your chances of passing the exam. Forget the networking section entirely, it will only succeed in frustrating you.About the only good thing that I can say about this book, is that it does seem to cover all of the exam objectives-- although in a quite confusing and incomprehensible manner.My recommendation is to utilize the resources on the Oracle Technology Network. With exam objectives in hand, you can find all of the subject matter you will need to gain complete comprehension of the topics. Save your money and good luck!"
3,"I like it, but...","I've been using barley green powder for over a year. I decided to try ""NOW"" brand because it's organic, I can get it in the 2 lb. container, and it costs less than what I've been paying. The taste and color is good but the texture is quite grainy. You have to add more water than you expected as it get's very thick and does not desolve all the way. I will finish this product, but I'm not sure I'll buy this product again."
3,Gritty City,"I am used to taking a dehydrated barley juice and paying out the @$$ for it, so when I saw the price on this I thought it would be worth a try. This is not a dehydrated juice it is the entire plant freeze dried and ground. I can't get past the grittiness of it. It is like swallowing soil. If you can deal with that it is, what they say it is and seems to be fairly well made i.e. it has a good color and smell."
3,Not as good as Kidz Bop #1,"My eight year old daughter loves Kidz Bop (#1) so I got her Kidz Bop 2. Just wanted a little variety in the car. We are not familiar with most of the songs on this 2 CD set. Guess we listen to Kidz Bop too much, and not to the radio so we don't know what's hot."
5,This One's Even Better!,"I bought Kidz Bop and it was in ""main rotation"" is the car CD for many months....They love Kidz Bop 2 even more......its really well done . The songs sound great (I even like it!) and I really appreciate the fact that they've removed any of the ""R"" lyrics...All in all a great sing~a~long for the car....I highly recomend this. Soccer Mom"
5,No Greater Love: A Unique Portrait of the Carmelite Nuns,Beautiful! Well done & presented. Very informative and insighful into the world of cloistered religious life and in particular the Carmelites.
2,Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover,"I first found this book at my college's library, and thought that it would be very entertaining and artistic. Having received it for Christmas and looked it over thoroughly, I am sorely disappointed. The book is nothing more than artsy camera shots and people who are wannabe artists. No doubt, Canadian Experimental Video is interesting, but the people writing the text for this book were writing it in an incredibly fartsy manner. Some of the excerpts from the videos are just garbage, and some don't make any sense. Not that art has to make sense, but it was fartsy. NO ONE BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Excellent for beginners!,"This is an excellent video for beginners. Dr. Lam gives six essential lessons in Yang style Tai Chi. The moves are presented by Dr. Lam in front and back angles, by his assistant with Dr. Lam commenting on the form and in group form. The moves are repeated several times and are relatively easy to follow for a beginner.I recommend you get the DVD version if possible. It is so much easier to fast forward or rewind than with a VHS tape. I don't think this video is suitable for intermediate or advanced students and it does not show the complete Yang form, however it is a great introduction for somebody with little or no Tai Chi experience."
3,Doesn't work with iPad,"Works fine with older iPods and it is definitely better than using the headphone output. Clearer, better dynamic range, fixed line level volume. Alas it does not work with a 1st gen wifi 3G iPad.I don't think this is a problem with the iPad since a line level audio cable out via the dock connector works fine with a similar cable from mono price. Trouble is I need one with RCA ends and the competitor only makes a 1/8 inch stereo one."
1,Does not work with 1st gen iPhone or iPod Touch,"I tried this cable on my 1st gen iPhone (with current software) and my wife's new iPod Touch. I also tried both Apple devices on four different stereo systems (Sony ES, Denon, old school Pioneer, and old school Teac) - didn't work on three of them; barely could hear the sound from the Pioneer with the volume all the way up on both the iPhone and the stereo...the iPhone speakers were much louder than the stereo while using this cable.I hope I just got a bad cable, since there seems to be a lot of good reviews and successful cases with other folks. Seems like some folks have ended up soldering pins and installing resistors - which is way beyond my interest level for getting this product to work properly. I would advise caution with this product since it works for many, but also doesn't work for several of us."
1,5th Generation Nano - Not Compatible!,"I wish I had stopped and looked at the reviews more carefully. This does NOT work with my 5th Generation iPod Nano. My bad for not reading further but this shouldn't be rocket science to have this capability on these devices. I don't know who to fault here: Apple for whatever they did between versions, the manufacturer of the cable or Amazon for not having this crucial piece of information in the description. Amazon - update the description for compatibility!"
