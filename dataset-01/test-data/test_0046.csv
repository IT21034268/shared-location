4,Great character voice,"Magnificently written, perfect voice. I have to admire Salinger's talent portraying a young man on the verge of a breakdown. I don't enjoy episodic structure in novels so the story dragged for me and I wanted to skim. I persevered because the book is on the recommended reading list for year 10 studies, which I sometimes teach. One of those books you should read, but not necessarily for pleasure."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,"I've always wondered what about this book makes it a classic so I borrowed it from a friend and got ready to be entertained. But I was sorely and thoroughly dissappointed. I can't believe this guy actually suckered a publishing house into actually printing this piece of garbage. Unles they did it as an example of just how NOT to write a book. There is no plot, no real character development and the language is instantly droll. If I hadn't borrowed this book I would have been angry at having been swindled out of good money. Don't waste your time."
2,Falling short of the hype,"I'll admit that I read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" because of its reputation. I have always heard that it is one of the greatest books of all time, a coming of age story that defines a generation. Upon completing the book I was left wondering what it all really was about. Maybe it was over my head and I could not appreciate its story, but from the moment I was introduced to Holden I never like him. I found his tales boring and his encounters dull. Each one was more irrelevant then the last. I just don't see how this book is on the same level as other great novels such as ""To Kill a Mocking Bird."" The only redeeming quality of the book is that it moved along fast and was a quick read (shocking for such a drab book)."
2,All the hype,"I don't like this book, but it isn't a terrible book, and I've read a lot of terrible books. In fact it's a good book, but that's it. It's good, it's ordinary. I've re-read Catcher three times now, I get it and what it try's to convey and all I have to say is, meh. For me there was nothing new, nothing exciting, and it certainly wasn't life changing.Is it really worth all the hype?"
2,I'm not sure if this is one of the worst books I've ever read,"A friend and I often swap books we thought were superb. We've swapped John Fowles, Jim Thompson, Dornford Yates, and many others.It was with excitement that I started this book, and I enjoyed the first 100 pages. But then it seemed to me that the author got bogged down in what he wanted to write. The second half of the book - The Sea, and then The Ice, was disjointed and tedious. The end was pathetic.In conclusion, the book starts well, but ends badly. Don't waste your time."
3,smillas sense of snow,I will only say that I enjoyed the first half of this book but found the remaining to drag and present some sort of contrived finale that was just too unbelievable. For an author who could write the first half I wonder where he went.
2,disappointing-over a book I looked forward to reading,"I felt the book began well with the first few chapters,but the middle 400 plus pages dragged on, and really didnot have any ""technothriller"" or mystery elements in them.Also, Smilla's ""sense of snow"" is only scattered in somepages, not as much as I thought would be written."
2,unable to finish,"I am an avid reader of all genres who prides myself on finishing every book I start. This book, however, has broken my track record. The writing appeared forced and its ""poetic"" prose is garbled. The sequence of events in this story are difficult to follow and I found myself forgeting characters and their names by the time they were mentioned in another chapter. The decription of the indigenous people of Greenland was interesting but was unable to redeem the overall dullness of this novel"
2,This will be better after Readers Digest gets done with it.,"The book was moderately entertaining but way WAY too wordy. The author has Smilla reminisce about everything from her life with ""Mom and Dad"" to talking out every thought she has ever had or ever entertained. While the writing is good and even entertaining at times, it is impossible not to get lost in the gestalt and miss the plot entirely. Final thoughts, if you like meandering plots and have a year or so to kill, read this book"
2,ho-hum,"Preditcable dialogue structure and an irritating main character make this book nothing more than an average thriller. Smilla's angst would be more convincing to me if she was much younger. In her late thirties, she strikes me as the type that just needs to get over it and move on. Others with her strength of character have been able to rise above the tragic circumstances of their lives."
5,Science fiction and mystery goes literary!,"Hoeg manages to merge genres and create a novel that is bothprovocative and evocative. He gives us a great sense of lifein Denmark and Greenland, with amazing social details andbelievably quirky characters.The facade of ""Smillas Sense of Snow"" is a modern action novel-- a best seller if you will. At heart it is truly literature.A book that I think is seminal in style. Beneath the surface'snow' is loads of depth!"
4,"Exceptional writing, ridiculous ending.","This book is beautifully written and translated. The most compelling aspect of ""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" is clearly Smilla herself - an intelligent, fascinating, but also cynical character, who is often as emotionally cold as the snow she ""smells"". Hoeg has done a wonderful job of creating an intriguing and believable character. As a Swede, I also appreciated the sense of melancholy, which is so very Scandinavian, and I find, an often rather depressing element in the book. As a writer, however, I was not very impressed with the plot. (Worms and meteorites, indeed!) Also, many of the love scenes - if you can call them that! - appear to be more the exercise of bodily functions (one physically impossible!) than acts of affection. This may, of course, only be a reflection of Smilla's emotional paralysis. All in all, a beautifully written book that is strong on characterization and social issues, but weak on plotting."
4,GAAP specific to non-profits,"Yes, it is 2008. But don't take the 2007 in the book's title too literally. The guidelines in the book are extremely unlikely to change in this year. The book is aimed as readers in US charities and other non-profit organisations. Describing in straightforward fashion how to do your books under GAAP. There is a presumption that you, the reader, are already a bookkeeper or accountant and are already familiar with the basics of bookkeeping.The book goes into aspects of GAAP that are likely pertinent to many non-profits. Like how to deal with an endowment. Or if a person comes to you and wants to establish a trust that would give distributions to that person while she is alive. And then, after her death, the trust's assets revert to your organisation. These and many other common situations for many established non-profits are well described."
4,Spirituality and Secret Societies,"Author and filmmaker, Phillip Gardiner takes you around the world in an attempt to show the relationship between the Ark of the Covenant, the Shroud, and the importance of Mary. Gardiner is in his element linking these entities to secret societies and brotherhoods such as the Knights Templar."
2,"plain, mediocre, hum-drum, pedestrian","If this had come out, oh say, in '92, I would've given it a second listen. This is the kind of stuff people like Madonna are doing now (but with more sass, and better production), and this is the kind of stuff what infinitely better ensembles such as Goldfrapp are riling againt - trite coffee-table music for yuppies. Egghh...who still drinks coffee...?"
3,"Does not fit as advertised, but Amazon's Return Policy Works!",These do not fit the front windows of a 1996 RAV4 as advertised. Returned for credit. AMAZON gets a 5-STAR rating from me on their return policy. Fantastic customer support.
2,not their best,"I Love Pro Pain but this album falls short of the self-titled, Round 6, Fistful of Hate releases."
2,bad vocal recording,"Their first album was great. I don't know what happened on this one. The music is cool in many instances, but the recording style on the vocals is just terrible. Instead of a clean, crisp, clear gutter growl, like on the first album, this one sounds like the singer has his voice coming out of a lowered, tuned down, crunched tin can. It's hard to explain, but it really ruins this album, which would've otherwise been quite good."
5,BIOLOGY: The study of life laboratory manual,It is a great lab manual for high school students. Some activities can be done in classroom and do not require a lab setting. Students can get deeper understanding without the hassle of using complicated chemicals or lab tools. It is a must have for any high school teacher who is teaching biology.
1,WRONG!,"Hello All! it not compatible with my car. Mazda 6i 2005 2.3.now, what can i do? i pay for Oxygen Sensor, but something wrong. in the box written BOSCH, but inside in the sensor written DENSO! why? it wo different brant!"
5,Awesome basketball documentary!,"I had a chance to view this program on HBO television last year and i must say it is as about as informative of the UCLA basketball program as you can possibly get. John Wooden created something really special back in the 60's all the way through the mid 70's decade. And in doing so, he cemented his legacy for many years to come. And in the process producing some of the finest players in the history of the game in doing so. I highly recommend this dvd documentary for any true basketball fan. I know for a fact that i will be copping it for my extensive hoop collection. I've always found the UCLA basketball program to be somewhat intriguing."
3,More fat than I anticipated,"When opening the package for the first time, I thought it was great, but it turns out that the small, 2 oz. bags are considered TWO servings, so the fat content is much higher than originally thought. If I had known about this, I would not have purchased them. I am on Weight Watchers and have a certain number of points allowed per day. If I ate a whole bag (2 oz.) of this product, it would count as 5 points. When I can only have 20 points per day, this is not a good option. The taste is OK, but not spectacular. Overall, I wasn't pleased with the product and feel the hype was better than the product."
4,Like Kool-aid without the sugar,"This is sweet, refreshing and tasty whether warm or cool. I can't wait until the summer as I know my daughter and I will enjoy it over ice."
1,Did not work as anticipated,"Shovel did not work as anticipated. Debris gets clogged in between the teeth, rendering the shovel useless. I gave it to the thirft store.Better to spend the money on a heavy duty shovel and keep it sharp."
2,The box said 10 films and just has 6 movies. What happened with this product?,"The box said 10 films and just has 6 movies. What happened with this product?where are the others 4 movies, the product has 3 disc, and each one has 2 movies."
5,How Can You Not Love Haven?,"The product, was just as advertised but did take take much longer to arrive than is usual when using the free shipping option. That was not an Amazon issue, it was the shipper (UPS). The packaging was intact, nothing cracked or broken. Haven is one of those shows that is a bit campy, different and quirky without coming off as totally ridiculous. You get a bit of new information about the characters just often enough to keep you interested in the larger story arc and to move it forward, yet each episode has a complete story within itself. I will be buying Season 3 when it comes out next fall."
1,Disc 1 defective,"Ordered this as a Christmas present for my daughter. We just tried watching it and the first disc would not load. The second disc loaded just fine, but that did not do us much good. Since I do my Christmas shopping early, I had bought this back in October, so I am pass the window for getting a replacement. Guess I will not be doing early shopping from Amazon next year."
3,It is entertaining but not super deep,"Haven is an interesting series, but seems very repetitive at times. Something weird happens, they go there, talk to people, a person is always responsible and the figure it out. It has it's moments and I do enjoy it, but I think it is geared toward a female audience."
5,Funny but a little too serious at times.,"I liked the book but it is not a terrific funny fiction book. I would recommed it to people who like serious books with a little kick of funnies. I think it is good for any age. I think the name Kitty is a good name for the dog because it came when Ricky's mom called the kittys. At first I did not like the book but then near the end I liked the book. Ricky was very scared of dogs,but the starvig dog changed that. Ricky kept saying he would run Kitty away,but he never did."
5,A Dog Called Kitty,"As a fourth grade teacher I read this book to my class to help display painting pictures with words. Yes, Kitty does die a tragic death; however, this story is a perfect example of a story coming full circle. The story beautifully written, though my students had difficulty understanding the OK setting and farm life it gave me an opportunity to share my life with them, growing up on a farm in MN. After reading this book many of my students were enticed to read more of Bill Wallace's books. For sensitive children warn them that with all things comes an end, but when a door closes a window opens. Though Ricky wanted to give up on dogs he could not."
1,Not For Sensitive Chidren...,"My nine-year old daughter was thrilled to select this book to read for a school project. She happily began reading it on her own, and I with her before bed. When I picked her up from school today she was in tears, telling me she had read ahead in the book and the beloved dog, after finally being united with the boy, dies suddenly near the end of the book. She was so upset she did not want to finish the book nor use it for her project. She is an avid reader and I have never had this experience before. If your child is tenderhearted or has a special love for animals, please read this book for yourself before sharing it with them. You become so attached to the dog that it is just gut-wrenching to have him die at the end (kind of like a downer movie you wish you hadn't paid to see). Had I known the ending of this book, I would never have let her take it home."
3,what you see ain't what you get.,"I ordered this DVD (To Duck or Not To Duck) after ordering Daffy Duck: Daffy and the Dinosaur. Different cartoons are listed for the DVD's on this website. However, when I received To Duck or Not to Duck, the picture was not as shown here. The picture was the exact same picture as on the Daffy and the Dinosaur DVD except that on the front it said ""To Duck or Not to Duck"" and the cartoons were exactly the same on both DVD's.These are old school cartoons and in very good to excellent condition for their age. They are great if you like Daffy. I just didn't need two copies of the same thing."
2,Not so moist,"This heating pad is supposed to provide moisture by your back sweating. Kind of a silly premise which I wasn't aware of when I bought it, and it doesn't work anyway. The heating pad gets so hot so quickly that you can't leave it on long enough to sweat. The result is no moist heat...just heat. As a safety feature you have to hold the control on at all times. OK I guess, but it's a pain. The pad is large enough to cover your whole back which is nice."
5,Back Relief,"When my Thermophone pad died after many years of use, I had to replace it in a hurry. I was so glad to find that it was still available. It was delivered with haste and I still love the therapy it provides."
2,"Works great, but no replacement parts available","We have used for several several years, and now the switch is broken. We have been happy with product, but when I called the company to get new switch, was told that they will not send replacement parts. Switch is simple to replace. 4 screws, clip off old clip on new, 4 screws back on cover. They are happy to have you send it in for repair, for $30, plus shipping, plus all the time you do not have the thermophore. by the time I would ship and have it repaired, it would be too close to new price. Bummer! so easy, yet company will not simply sell switch. So beware, it will work well for time, but if you need repair, you might as well throw away and get new one, perhaps different brand."
2,No ON switch,"I returned this heating pad because it's not what I was looking for. It doesn't get really hot and you have to hold the switch down to keep the heat on. As soon as you let the switch go, the pad turns off."
2,Not adjustable,"Simply, this heating pad works great in every way except one: the intense heat is either off or on. There are to temp adjustments. I consider that a huge problem."
5,Best heating pad on the market,Had this pad for 20 years and it finally quit working. Bought the exact same one that I had (same product number & everything!). This time bought it from Amazon for less! I love it!
4,Excellent value,"I was a little put off by the price, but very tired of buying cheap, drugstore pads that burned out with constant use. Once I plugged this in, however, the intense heat reminded me of why I needed a good one in the first place. The pain relief is amazing. It takes a few tries to get the hang of the control (I just hold it in place with the back of my knee) but it's a small trade off for the almost instant relief. I'd have given it 5 stars, but like all the others, it's hard to use on my neck."
2,sad,"You know who did it, how and why before 18 pages are done and the murder doesn't take place until page 80. As it happens I heard the author speaking once, when the book was new. She wrote it as a rebellion against poor sentence structure, grammar, dialogue she had seen in other of the Star Trek series. Okay, success. Shame she didn't have help with the mystery thing."
3,"The Vulcan are interesting, Kirk is an idiot","This book would deserve four stars for the beautiful setting and all the insight in the life of the people on Vulcan - I loved Corrigan and Sorel. But only two for the actual plot. The culprit was obvious from the get-go and Kirk fumbled the investigation really badly. Wow, I couldn't believe that he was the captain of the Enterprise, he behaved like a love-struck rookie!"
5,Good Battery for RV's,I have three of these batteries for my RV's and they all work great. Keep them properly maintained with aNOCO GEN3 NOCO Genius Black 12-36V 3-Bank 30A On-Board Battery Chargerand these batteries will keep working like new. No complaints at all!
3,Definitely Disappointed - D31 Blue Top,"My experience was similar to others regarding receiving last years stock,so I would agree you should buy locally. Initially I wasn't too concerned with the extra age as I have had great experience out of my Optima Red Top battery in my Jeep - it's now going on 5+ years. I purchased 4 ea Blue Tops for my boat hoping for the same kind of experience, but alas it wasn't to be the case. All three expired at the end of the second season conveniently right after the expiration. While my cruiser is tough on batteries due to refrigerators, ice makers, etc. the batteries are always on a charger via shore power when it's not in use so it's not as if they're not maintained. I've gotten two seasons out of batteries that were significantly cheaper and twice that out of premium batteries like Lifeline. For the pricepoint on the Optima's I would have expected more longivity."
2,Battery,"I can remember when you could buy a Optima Battery that you could count on to give you good service, and last several years longer then the warranty.Istarted having problems one month after the warranty expired."
1,Bad service period,"I purchased my first Red top Optima battery from O'Reilly Auto 7/19/2008. Fortunately it failed 1 week before the replacement warranty ran out 7/11/2011(3 yrs). The replacement Optima battery I got lasted 5 months (2000 miles) before it too started to fail (wouldn't hold charge). Even thou it wasn't that old O'Reilly wouldn't exchange it due to Optima's 3 yr. replacement warranty with NO PRO RATED EXCHANGED! Spending another $200.00+ for a battery that doesn't last more then 3 yrs. was a bit outrageous, so I purchased a Super Start 36/78 from O'Reilly for $112.00 knowing I'll be somewhat covered for the next 6 yrs.I find it disturbing that Optima sells these batteries for $200.00-$250.00 with no pro-rated exchange knowing they won't last for more then 3 yrs!"
2,For those who really like cattle,"If you're a veterinarian or really like to read about cattle, horses and other animals, you might like this.I got this for a buck at a fund raiser where the only other choices were romance novels, a Johnny Cochran book and one by Charles Barkley. Hey, I was desperate to help the fund raiser.I only made it through about 50 pages. It's 266 pages of Dr. McCormack telling about his life as a rural veterinarian in Alabama. No engaging story line, IMO anyway, just page after page of stories about him establishing his business, helping animals and talking with locals in southern, country lingo.The story starts with him coming to the rescue of a cow nearly dead from some gas causing it to bloat excessively, which caused its uterus to protrude. He saved it by releasing the gas, giving it medicine and reinserting its uterus....all in the cold, rain and mud.Pretty amazing doctoring, but not something I care to do or read about. If that's interesting to you, buy it."
4,Nice block,"The blocks are nice, though not the same density as the ones we use in class. This certainly does not hinder my ability to use them and they are still totally functional. My one complaint is that the blocks have a strong chemical smell when they are first opened. I hope that it will go away once they are aired out. Aside from the smell, the blocks are of good quality and the price is excellent. If the smell diminishes, I will be ordering more of these blocks."
5,Product as listed,I ordered these yoga blocks for use in the Yoga workouts in my P90X program. No complaints. A good buy and a good product.
2,Shopping for a new one...,"Because I just toasted this POS impulse buy. Lasted a few uses and then when I tried to put a little more torque to it yesterday it gave out. Spins either direction, lock on back won't turn. Back to the breaker bar for today I guess."
4,brings back memories!,These songs brought back a lot of fun memories. I would recommend it to anyway who enjoyed music then and now. Just fun!
5,Great!,great collection/variation.... haven't stoped listening to it. I wasn't alive in the 60's but I love the music and this CD is a great additon to my iTunes. :)
3,Munchkin Deluxe Baby Food Organizer,This product is OK. If you turn the tray with bottles in the wrong direction it falls down. Not my fav feature but it keeps my kitchen neater so it's worth it.
5,A great product,"I actually ordered these to use for marking sections in my textbooks. They offer more space for writing on and the adhesive feature allows me to place them on the edges of the pages. They are thick enough to stand out from the book and not roll up like the flags do. I wasn't sure if they would work for doing this, but they work great. I use different color ink to write what I need on them, so its easy to find the section I want to in the books as well. So...there you have it, another use for the printable hanging file tabs. Not only are they useful for folders, you can use them to mark your textbooks as well!! A great versatile product."
4,Not what I was expecting...,I got this book because I had always heard of it in reference to it's similarities to the Titanic. It was not at all what I was expecting but it was a good book and a very quick easy read at less than 100 pages. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it!
4,"Deep messages, but not always clear at first","I found it necessary to read these poems slowly and in most cases twice. The first pass through made me pause, sometimes I thought for a moment and understood and in other cases I read it again. This poetry can be classified under the ""experimental"" genre and in most cases it is a description of a dark event or condition. Despite my confusion, I found the messages to be powerful, well worth reading. Among other things, they examine the plight of the common soldier, working class conditions, drug usage, the experiences of daily life and communing with a fish head."
2,"Ok, but","sort of a bore and nothing really especially moving. I bought this because of his connections with two of my favourites, Indigenous and SRV (the best part of the CD in fact is old stuff with Stevie on it)and I was pretty disappointed."
2,It's different: don't make this your first L & H movie.,"This French-Italian production has Stan and Ollie inheriting a South Seas island and discovering uranium. The bad news is that Laurel & Hardy were seriously ill during production (in some scenes Stan looks awful), and everyone except Laurel & Hardy is badly dubbed in English. On the bright side, there is some good visual humor; Laurel & Hardy do an excellent job considering the language barrier and production problems. Interesting as a curio and historically significant as the team's last film, but not a prime example of Laurel & Hardy comedy. This title is available on a number of video labels; the Madacy Video version suffers from the extended-play recording."
2,"Iain's worst by far, I think...","Iain went too far with this book. If you read this, it's good at first (especially with the Lt.'s introduction killing Half-Caste) but when you keep going it gets horribly one-toned.Too many scenes are ruined by its consistently bleak nature. Abel always seems to be the underdog; the loser. When he gets his moment, he ruins it again and the story gets worse and worse. Way too much angst and way too much extremities simply adds up to a bad novel.It's too bad really, because it makes an excellent first impression. However, it has too many flaws as a novel so overall I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
3,Multi-layer difficulty,"I don't know what to make of this book. In some senses it felt very flat and in others it seemed to have a depth of meaning that I couldn't completely unearth. I also had a hard time getting over the use of second person to refer to Morgan. I can see stylistically how it was used and how it developed Abel's character, but it was a bit jarring."
1,Boring rubbish,"Although the use of language is most eloquent, the story doesn't go anywhwere. What story there might be is interrupted by chapters about the main character's sex life, which couldn't possibly be more out of context. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I stuck to the end, even on the last chapter hoping there would be some redemption. But there wasn't. Not only that but it is a very dark and depressing story, to which I failed to see any point.Loved The Wasp Factory, The Bridge, Complicity. Hated this one and Whit."
2,A self-indulgent tedium from an author who knows better.,"As a great fan of this author, this was the single most disappointing piece of work of his that I've ever read.While the actual writing is near flawless as per usual, the book descends into sheer self indulgence as Banks loses his direction several times and then trys to rescue the focus with some pointlessly horrific scenes.The atmosphere is dark and brooding, and Banks' usual style has the successful effect of leaving you slighly stunned - but at the end of this book you feel as if you were invited to a great gothic horror party only to find that all the people there are desperately uninteresting."
3,Relaxation cd -average,I only listened to it once; it's a christmas present for my two teens. It was ok.
4,Poetry does not exist to make you comfortable,"I feel compelled to respond to the person who found the opening poem ""racist"" because the speaker says ""another child has killed a child / and i catch myself relieved that they are / white.""First of all, the fact that a poem depicts a certain attitude or feeling does not mean that the poet endorses that attitude or feeling. In this case, the sentiment is honest even if it is not morally admirable. Poetry does not always depict life or human nature as we would like them to be, but rather as they are.Second, the last line of the poem says ""these too are your children this too is your child."" So the poem has corrected the speaker's own withdrawal from the scene. It ends, I think, with a rejection of racism...but it could be a good poem even if it did not."
1,Quack and Hypocrite,"This quack played an important role in preventing women from being able to buy the morning after pill without a prescription.It turns out that, according to his former wife, he is also an anal rapist. That's how he cares for women.The fact that the Bush administration is willing to appoint quacks and hypocrites like this to important decision making positions demonstrate just how sick and perverted this administration is.Whenever religion and politics are mixed, the result is detrimental to both."
1,reality check,"Here're the facts: The man is a member of the FDA committee, not the chair. He was appointed in December 2002 (two years ago, folks) and he'll be out in June of this year (2004). The chair of the committee is a woman scientist from Stanford. Some of the circulating Hager rumour is exaggerated. However, at least three standing members in the FDA roster do publicly blend their christianity with their Science. I'm simply glad there are still committees of scientists involved in government. I tried three weeks ago to post this message with links to corroborate myself, but my post didn't make it up here. Since the rumour (see snopes) is up again, I thought I would try to rebut the previous reviewer anyway."
2,Why publish black and white photos of orchids?,"This book has a great deal of useful information, but about 90% of the orchid photography is in black and white. One of the joys of any orchid book is the illustrations. In this case, most of the art is not even very useful for identifying the plants, as color is so essential. Very disappointing."
1,sanitised edition,"I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"I drink alot of different energy drinks daily. Now I have stopped and use this it is much better for you and taste awesome, gives you a big boost with no crash hands up 5 star"
3,Double Dare,"Excellent video, deserves to be seen by more people. About the struggles of two stunt women to gain respect (and more administrative power) in a traditionally male profession."
4,Nice side project,"Basically, in my own words, Emigrate is sort of a side project for Richard Kruspe (guitarist and founder of Rammstein). Its all in English, so for the non-german listeners it should be a lot easier to understand. In a couple of the songs, I could hear some basic beats taken from Rammstein to be implemented here. But, it really does have a whole new sound. The songs vary in pace and strength of the beats. Overall, a very good cd and well worth it. Especially if youre a fan of Kruspe."
5,Fantastic Value,"SanDisk's 4GB memory cards are a phenomenal value and (as a photographer) they are also a safe and efficient way to have that ""hard copy"" backup!"
5,"Great card, great price.","I own five of these cards, shooting with two Nikon D-200's, and have never had a single issue. I make sure to always format in camera, rather than in the computer. I do quite a bit of fast action shots, and the write speed on these cards is phenomenal. I never have to wait for the buffer to catch up.I won't hesitate to buy more of these, as I consider SanDisk to be the top of the line."
5,Great Product,Great product I have over 22 gigs of these cards for use in my two canons (a 5D and a 300D)It's easier to carry extra memory cards than lug a lap top around for longer trips. I've never had a problem with any of these cards
4,Fair price - fair performance,"I use it with my dSLR camera (Olympus E-510) and the only difference I notice between this one and Extreme III version is when copying photos to computer using Sandisk Imagemate reader. So it's a solid performer, and so far reliable, no file system problems."
1,not compatible with my computer software or Wi photo,"After our vacation in Maui, I was excited to download photos onto my computer only to be frustrated that none of the computer software, scanner or even Wi photo would recognize the disk. My only hope now is to go to Walmart and make a CD of the 30 photos that I took. This seems counter productive as to why I bought such a large capacity disk (so I would'nt have to keep making CD's and clear my my other disks) I am back to wasting gas and time for 30 pics."
2,Sandisk Ultra 2 4GB CF Card,"I was disappointed with this product, as it is not a true SanDisk card, and rather a knockoff. The card did not even look like the image provided on the purchase. I will not trust this card with storing images, but it is currently working properly. I would not do business with this seller again."
4,Quality Card,I bought two of these cards and have had zero problems with them. Have even preformed flawlessly with video. I'd give them five stars except a friend of mine experienced card failure shooting a wedding with one of these recently.
5,Very Neat Item!,Have had it for a while now and so far it has been able to take the abuse I heap on it and the camera I use (Minolta Maxxum A2). Great for stills and videos. No problems with storing of my files for looong periods of time and hope to still be using this for at least the lifetime of the camera.
2,Ultra flash card,This card is so slow that I have to wait between shots. I am using a Cannon Rebel XTI Love the camera and until this flash card I had no complants.
3,Mostly Canon Issues with the card,"Mostly Canon with the memory access problems.Anyway for cards this large one should not continously delete as not deleating will force use of the rest of the memory space. Full delete for large shoots, raw formats, and trips.Flash memory does have a FINITE number of times the cells can be modified.Resulting in corrupted data hard errors."
4,Great Performance,I used my new Ultra II 4GB CF card this past weekend at the race track. I used it in my Canon EOS 40D at high frame rate (6.5 fps) and it was flawless. It never slowed me down or had an error. Two thumbs up!
1,Take your vitamins.......it's tiring and dreary,"I wanted to love this book and I wanted to give it to some of my friends who are adopted and have had a similar search. To be honest, they all did it better and in less than two years of vascillating! I have faced cancer, divorce, deaths of child, mother, brother and business partner with less pathos than this young woman needed just to pick up a phone and call her parents! I just don't get it! My friends who have gone through it did it better and I'm encouraging them to write about it in a more tangible manner. I felt the author was wimpy and torturous in her journey and also extremely selfish."
5,An interesting and thought-provoking book.,"As a birthmother who was recently reunited with her daughter, I found this book to be very interesting. Even though, in my situation, my daughter found me, this book gives me an insight into what some of my daughter's feelings must be.This book allows me to see a different side of the adoption reunion."
3,Not as easy to clean as I thought,"I like the fit of the floor mats but wish they would cover the dead pedal side too. The mats aren't as easy to clean, it's not really just ""hose it off"" as I thought. You will want a brush to stir up the dirt then it will come off ok."
5,Live is the Answer,"Back in the day, artists would utilize the progressive FM radio formats in major cities to really give a new album or tour a boost; and that meant airing live performances for regional or national distribution.Part of the Todd Rundgren Bootleg Series, this second volume is a Utopia concert that aired on KSAN from San Francisco in 1979. Originally produced to promote Adventures in Utopia, the 13-song set had been released in unauthorized ""bootleg"" forms over the years, with the sound quality oftentimes very muddled.Under the direction of Rundgren, the remastered material is given the proper venue to show its full artistry and the band's fantastic stage presence. Though a fan may have the concert in another form, this is the definitive release."
5,Instant Delivery,SD Card holds a gazillion pictures..was delivered in nanoseconds...Amazon is awesome did not expect to get item for another week or so...was home in no time...Memorial Day was all on camera...
1,Stopped working.,My camera and computer both cannot read nor format the card for some reason. I've had the card for about 3 months. I also have a 1gb card from sandisk that's been working for a long time. I'll never buy this one again.
1,SanDisk 2G SD memory card,"The card was defective when it arrived. The stated Amazon processing time for returns was about 4 weeks and I needed a replacement sooner. SanDisk was very thorough, but accomodating in replacing the memory. The new one was received in plenty of time and works just fine. Kudos for SanDisk Customer Service. None for Amazon's replacement reaction time."
1,It broke,"I was only able to use it for 3 days maybe, then an error message appeared on my camera ""memory card error"" I now cannot delete or add any pictures."
5,Great card for Canon S80,"I've heard people having problems with this card using older cameras and readers. I've taken 3500 pictures with my Canon Powershot S80 and have never had a problem. I download my pictures using a Lexar 7 in 1 reader. I never use the camera software since it's half-baked and designed for newbies who lack access to Photoshop, it's browser or the bridge.Before deciding not to benefit from the extra space this 2gb card offers, check your camera manufacturer's site to see if your camera is compatible. Most older camera's and readers will not work with this card and those that do, usually require you to format the card in-camera before you use it.Great storage space for vacations. I might need to get a second card."
4,SanDisk Ultra II - 2GB memory card review,"This is my second SanDisk Ultra II SD memory card, the first was lost with my camera so I had to get another one. It's a good SD card, great price and performance."
1,Never arrived,"This item never arrived to me. After repeated mails also, there was no reply from the vendor. I never had any clue about this as there was no option to track my item.."
1,Too many defects,"I have bought SanDisk products in the past, and I was happy with them. However, this time I got a defective memory card right off the package, and its replacement was defective as well! It's highly unlikely for two out of two cards to be defective. I tried them in three different devices, all of them functioning perfectly well, and I know the defect was in the memory card. I amd disappointed this particular model of SanDisk has such quality problems. :("
3,Where is the price performance?,"I can get a SanDisk Ultra II for twice the price of a regular SanDisk's SD card and 3-4x of a genetic brand. I have yet seen the speed increase that is printed squarely on the package: 10mb/s read and 9mb/s. I got a new Sony Card reader that can read this Ultra II at 5.6-6.01 mb/s and write at 4.8 mb/s. My cheaper regular Dana-elec 1GB SD can read at 5.5 mb/s and the same write speed around 4.8 mb/s. This is data shown on the Vista's screen. I am not sure if the only time I will get the performance of the spec is to purchase a SanDisk Ultra II card reader.I do have a Nikon D40 digital SLR and was thinking this uber performance card is for burst/continous speed, but other cards can do the same. I really didn't noticed any different between this model and the generic SD card except for the premium pricing of the Ultra II. So I don't see the price performance value here at all. It does work fine."
5,Nice Storage to Price ratio,This memory card offers a great price vs storage ratio. Not bad for a name brand memory card. Has a pretty fast write speed if your camera can take advantage of the added speed.
4,fairly fast processing,fairly fast processing with PANASONIC FZ8 camera.For serial shots a faster card might be recommended.But good value for the price.
5,A fantastical twist on the classic tale of sons reckoning with failed fathers,"Gullboy is a tremendously fun read...but woven through the delightful, imaginative, fanciful, outrageous and sexy fast-turning pages is an insightful tale of how fathers fail their sons, particularly as they grow into manhood. And, oh, how that failure can be passed down the generations as each son tries to find his way out from feeling abandoned! The author makes Franco an ""unreal"" boy...or is he? Ernesto and Franco's father-son relationship is so touching, so demonstrative, it feels so real. It makes sense that Ernesto, like so many fathers, just wants to see his son soar. But can Ernesto really see Franco through his cloak of feathers? Read this delightful, meaningful book....and the trip through Coney Island, and all the wonder there ain't bad, either!"
2,"Bland, razor thin scripts, epitomizes the worst of fifties tv","After enjoying the still fresh, witty, and tender-hearted Leave it to Beaver series on DVD, I was ready for another fifties family sit-com. I bought this show as it always got better ratings than LITB. What a disappointment! The scripts are razor thin, the humor is non-existent, the whole series reeks of the kind of blandness that fifties sit-coms are mocked for. Poorly written by hacks, this one is moldy and has aged very poorly. Carl Betz is handsome but wooden. Donna Reed is pretty but totally unconvincing. The kids are self-consciously annoying actors with Paul Petersen's character hinting at the aggravatingly precocious child actors to come later on in TV land. Skip this one."
2,There are bettter monitors in the market,Not good for larger houses. Ours picks up radio signals sometimes.
2,Lots of excess noise then totally quit,"This was a great monitor for the first 4-6 months, which is very soothing to a first time mom. But then we started picking up our neighbor's AM gospel channel each evening. We had dual recievers and the first one totally quit working after 9 months. Then we had to take the other one from the bedroom to the living room and eventually the plug wore out after a couple more months. Now it is not even working with the batteries. They last about 1 minute when you turn it on, then it just fades out!? I was hoping this one would last through at least 2 children, but it didn't even make it 15 months."
2,picks up local AM station,"After trying this out I'm returning it today. It picks up a lot of static including an AM station that can be heard pretty clearly. Plus, it is annoyingly bright at night...like having a nightlight on. Wish I read the reviews before I bought it."
1,Don't bother - horrible static,"We have two monitors that we use constantly - one for our baby's room and one for our toddler's room. We have a much cheaper Safety 1st monitor that works sooooo much better than the more expensive Fisher Price Sounds N Lights monitor. The FP monitor has constant static. It's obnoxious and you can barely hear noises from the child's room over the static noise. We've tried all 10 channels, with and without the other monitor on and nothing improves the static problem. I would never recommend purchasing this product. We will be purchasing a different monitor to replace this one."
5,favorite childhod memory of a book,"I used to read Jan Bret books all the time in elementary school, they were my go to book every time our class went to the library! the pictures are amazing and the story from what I remember was always good. i really just want to but the book for the memories and maybe for a kid that needs a good story."
5,Not just for children,Jan Brett is one of my favorite children's authors. She has great story lines for children but her pictures are full of surprises. Another wonderful book!
4,I like the author,"My young niece Addy likes this book because (dictated) it has a story going on below as well as up above. It is actually two stories. I don't think the trolls were that nice. They weren't scary, though. They take her mittens and then her hat. They want her dog. They also take her sweater and her boots. She must be very cold. I recommend this book. It is one of the best books I have seen but it isn't the very best book I have ever read."
2,kinda just there,let's get a few things out of the way.Paul Mccartney is a Musical Genius&is one of the Greatest Musical Talents Ever in any Era or time in Music as we know it.now having said all of that Paul seems intent on Mocking His Great genius&depth with over the top gloss Discs of Live Shows He has done a Million&1 times or so it seems.I've enjoyed better performances from the Man over the Years.I Wish Paul would stop tripping on the Past&just get back too what Made Him So Great in the first place.get back too Words&Music&stop tripping on who did what first.
2,Same ol' same ol',"The same old songs over and over again, from tour to tour. Doesn't he remember any of the other greats, i.e. ""Fixing A Hole"", ""Oh, Darling"", ""You Won't See Me"", ""Another Day"", ""Venus And Mars"", etc.? If I hear ""Jet"" or ""Live and Let Die"" from him one more time I think I'll puke! A better band would have been in order as well. He's great fun to watch in concert, but he ought to tweak his set list a little more."
2,Disappointing,"OK, so the CD has all the songs from the tour on it, whereas the DVD is missing about 7 or 8 songs.But the CD, for me, is completely absent of any of the excitement and emotion I saw and felt when I saw McCartney in Atlanta. Why? Because the CD is song...applause...song...applause...song...well, you get the point.NOT ONE BIT of Paul's onstage comments are included in the CD. The omissions that stand out for me are:1. When he introduced Getting Better, and talked about doing live Beatles songs that they never got to do live...2. His heartfelt dedications to Heather for Your Loving Flame and to Linda for My Love.3. My biggest disappointment is omitting his heartfelt words about John when he introduced Here Today, and then talking about playing ukeleles with George before he played Something.As with the DVD, Paul is listed as Executive Producer of the CD. In both cases, he's a better musician than he is a producer."
2,Too old to rock and roll,"Sir Paul should stick to studio recordings at this point. His voice no longer sounds good live, understandably so.If you want a great Paul McCartney live album, when he was at the peak of his powers, with a great band, buy Wings Over America."
2,Awful Live Recording,"The recording of this live music is one of the worst I've ever heard and rivals the quality on some bootlegs. The guitars are way up and overpower everything else, including Paul's voice. There's no transition between the songs - just wait 3 seconds and the next one starts. Amateurish is the best way to describe this effort."
2,Heads up Ringo,"To me this disc is marred by Macca's knack for opportunism. Beatles greatest hits packaged in Red white and blue. How timely. I am amazed at how petty Paul is. Reversing the song credits to Mccartney/Lennon is shameful. All you need is love Sir Paul. Oh wait, that was John's. Or was it? I'm sure if he recalls correctly, Paul can take credit for writing George's Something. The one apparent truth seems to be that The Beatles are dying in order of coolness. Heads up Ringo!"
1,"No, cupidity is INdecent.","How many times do we need to hear ""Silly Love Songs""?How about Z-E-R-O times?This guy has pandered to the LCD for 33 years, and here we have a monument to that and to unprecedented price-gouging (the tour).""Freedom"" is gutless bootlicking.No, thank you."
3,A tired voice with great songs!,I am a true blue Beatle fan and McCartney fan. That said the songs here are great but the recording in the live environment is poor. Paul sounds very tired and somewhat bored with the whole thing. The songs save it from being a complete disaster of a compilation. Anybody else and I would rate this lower. My wife even said he sounds tired and worn out. I said to her that he is 60 years old for heavens sake and I admire his even being there. I have seen him live and it was one of the best performances one can experience.
2,Everything is NOT what it appears to be,"I know and like the ""original formula"" of Curel. It seems to be the only product that really works for me - here in ultra dry Arizona. The product that I ordered this last time was the ""ultra healing"" formula of Curel and it feels totally greasy to me. The only reason I ordered this version of Curel - was because I couldn't find the other product (original formula) that I wanted. Now I am stuck with 4 bottles of this stuff."
5,Great experience!,"After looking everywhere, I found this exact jacket my son wanted to replace one he had lost a couple of years ago(and he was ""lost"" without it). He uses it as a lightweight rainproof jacket in spring and fall, and also layers it over a winter fleece or sweatshirt for winter and snow or mixed precipitation, since he walks to work and everywhere possible. The design and quality are excellent,it was a great price, the service was excellent and fast. I plan to buy more for my grandsons also."
3,Bing takes another turn at show tunes,"On this CD, Bing Crosby sings many of the songs that have come to be popular standards in this country. Some of these tunes include ""Lady of Spain,"" ""P.S. I Love You,"" and ""Mona Lisa."" Other well known recordings are ""Don't Let the Stars get in Your Eyes,"" ""Hawaiian Wedding Song,"" and ""Lady of Spain."" If you prefer these songs by the person who had the original hit with it, then you probably would not want to listen to this CD. If, on the other hand, you simply love the song stylings of the great Bing Crosby, then you might want to think about giving this CD a whack."
2,For Breeders Only with Advanced Training,This book is extremely technical. You almost need to be a vet to understand it. I would recomend The Whelping and Rearing of Puppies by Muriel Lee. It is reader friendly and gives the same information with many picture examples.
2,Missing basic infomation,"Ms. Holst's text, while deeply informative, might be better suited for first or second year veterinary students. Yes, I wanted and needed to learn more about breeding; however, I wasn't anticipating such a scholarly volume that I had to decode! The depth to which Ms. Holst examines breeding, and the mechanics of breeding, was a bit overdone; and yet, she omitted basic information such as what age is appropriate to begin using your dogs for breeding. I did enjoy the challenge of putting all her medical jargon into to laymens terms, but perhaps the publisher might want to consider offering college credit with each purchase!"
5,Purrfect for cold kitties,I didn't think this product would attract my cats. They love soft blankets. But since I got these I can't keep them off of them. They keep their fur on the pad & they love them. Product just as desecribed! Recommend highly!
2,A Smell You can Smell...all day!,"This perfume really does smell clean but it's a little over-powering. I typically do not wear perfume that I can smell on myself all day b/c it makes me sick. This perfume definitely sticks around so I won't buy it anymore. I like perfume that fades into a more natural smell. This perfume is so strong, when I eat, my food tastes like it. But for the overall smell, it does smell like a laundry detergent."
5,Very clean fresh smell,so fresh and clean this is a nice layering scent no need to layer but it works well with fruity scents
5,I had this book,"I found it very interesting. The planes just flew into Lake Michigan on a clear night. Ships just sank. The wreck of theEdmund Fitzgerald, of which Gordon Lightfoot sang in the1970s, was real. In November 1975, the Edmund Fitzgerald,a Great Lakes ore carrier with 29 crewmen, sank on LakeMichigan. She sank in the worst storm in over sixty years.The Edmund Fitzgerald was traveling in tandem with another ore carrier, the Arthur M. Anderson, when she sank.The Discovery Channel had a special about her in the '90s, and they had a salvage team raise the ship's bell. A plaquerests on the bottom of the lake."
5,My Kids Love It!,"I have a 6yr girl and 3yr boy and they both get a kick out of it, especially my 6yr who loves to read it over and over. Of course my boy loves to see the pictures of blood and it was quite informative as well. We have tons of books, but the `funny' ones like this and `The Holes in Your Nose', `The Gas we Pass' and the `Poop' books are the ones they always pick to read most often. I hope your kids enjoy it as well! God bless you!"
5,Dr Tom Is a Purchasing Guru,Great practical book for the supply chain or purchasing professional. Easy read and has good humorous axioms. A superb laconic style just for the purchasing professional.A superb effort.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I was looking for a replacement Nalgene for my husband. The picture represents exactly what I received. The narrow mouth works great for us and our small children (less spills). The only difficulty we have is adding ice to the bottle.
4,Worth it,"Though the placement of the Nyahbinghi rastas is odd and unexplained, the movie is educational and well worth purchasing. The movie summarizes (briefly) the history of the IMF. It also explores the world of global competition (between US and Jamaican goods). Extremely worth watching and well recommended to anyone, especially educators."
5,Michigan Star Watch,This is a great book .It explains the constellations and where to find them and also has detailed star maps for the different seasons of the year.It has been invaluable in looking at the summer sky with my grandson.It is also filled with information about the history of star gazing and how the constellations were named. It is very informative and good reading even if you are stuck indoors.
4,A Weird but Rewarding Trip Back in Time,"I just bought this DVD new from Amazon and love it. Hadn't seen the movie since I was in college in '70 and HAD to see it again. It was worth it. My wife walked in while Jagger is singing Memo from Turner and was transfixed. We have seen the Stones in concert multiple times, but she had never seen Jagger like that. To me, this film is a cult classic, not because of the acting or the story, but because of its total weirdness, its mesmerizing music (particularly Ry Cooder's signature guitar), the presence of Jagger, and its sexual themes (hedonism, threesomes, androgeny). A mediocre movie that is totally hypnotic."
3,solid information,"This book, although dry, is a must for anyone who desires to know more about the Moravian church and its missions. The ultimate in general knowledge."
1,Not Worth Your Time and Money,"This book has a little of everything and not enough of anything. There is a little HTML, but the information is not really helpful. A lot of pages are wasted on screen shots of an installation, but there are no guidelines for setting all the configuration options. More than 100 pages are wasted reprinting Oracles own documentation of the web server packages, but again no value is added. There is even a chapter on tuning SQL, but again not enough information to be usefulEvery time I have faced a question not solved by the documentation, this book has been unable to help.This book is a disappointment!"
3,JUST SCRAPES BY ......,"""OK"" product for the price ........... adding in the shipping makes it a pretty expensive pan cleaner........ I rough sponge gets in corners just as well"
4,This is not for the NEW ipod Shuffle!,"Just wanted to make sure if you just got a new ipod shuffle that you don't order these headphones. I got them for my dad for Christmas because he was getting the new shuffle for Christmas - but it turns out that the new shuffle is too small for these headphones. They are for the first generation ipod shuffle. So I can't say whether these are good or not, just that they don't work for the new ipod shuffle."
1,Glitter,"I am on a quest to find a good, inexpensive self tanning product. I tried this product and it is so far the worst one yet! The ""tan"" is nothing but glitter. I felt like a really bad craft project.Will submit tried and true reviews of each of the tanning products that I use until I find the right one."
1,?,"I read this book when I was at a friend's house; I was attracted by the title, but dissappointed by the content. If you have common sense, nothing in this book will be news to you, and not all of the advice is good. The book also fails to treat men as individuals, as the author seems to think that the same tactics will work on all males. Being a male myself, I can assure you that this approach is erroneous. Better communication with your partner will do far more than this silly tome ever could."
2,Very Juvenile,"This book uses a lot of cliches, that I could have wrote myself. I was looking for a book that I could use for my husband and from the summary of this book I thought it sounded interesting and could possibly be helpful, boy was I wrong!!!!! The writing was very juvenile and it was as if it was written with a teenage audience in mind!!!!!"
3,not for single women !,"This book is basically about increasing intimacy, through sex, in a relationship. as a how to guide, it sucks. there are no actual usable pysical tips or guidelines. however if you are looking to spice up a longstanding relationship, this would suit you down to the ground."
5,Just what I needed!,This book hits the mark. It provides a solid overview of VB Express and .Net. Its review of OOP was suprisingly easy to understand and the sample applications that you learn how to build provide a very practical learning experience. The only negative that I can point to are a few minor typos but nothing out of line with most books these days. The bottom line is that this is most understandable programming book I have every read. You won't find an easier read or a better presentation for beginner users.
1,"Bad, bad lesson","What a piece of trash! Advertised as a new book, I've got books I've read half a dozen times over twice as many years which are in better shape than this one. Probably my last purchase from Amazon ... an amazing lesson!"
3,Wordy thriller,A thriller that suffers from too many words and unnecessary filler. The pace for this story slows and becomes tedious in places. A third of the book could be removed and it would be an improvement.
4,Very Good / Very long,"Not an easy read but a very comprehensive book covering Hitler's youth, rise to power and downfall. The author provides an incredible level of detail. I read it over a 6 month timeframe and enjoyed it."
4,"Good account, but he lets his liberal bias show through","Quite a good and very thorough account of the time. The problem I have is that he lets his liberal slant show through in his treatment of the non-Nazi political movements of the 1920s. But I am quite impressed with his tracing of the roots of the Nazi ideology, especially in regards of the German philosophers of the 19th century who he readily acknowledges to be the progenitors of both Nazism and Communism (Hegel, Fichte, Kant, Nietzsche, etc.). Very few commentators seem to acknowlege that Fascism and Communism are two sides of the same statist coin, coming from the same philosophical roots."
2,Great Book Until I got to Pg 836,"I have wanted to read this book for what literally amounts to 50 years and finally decided to treat myself to the 50th Anniversary edition as a Christmas present. As expected, the book is a riveting account of a very dark period of world history, expertly written by William L. Shirer. Unfortunately, due to a printing error, my particular volume did not include pages 837 through 868, 30 critical pages chronicling the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. I have contacted Amazon and they are going to send a replacement but I only hope the error was caught by the publisher and the replacement does not have the same missing pages. I also hope no one else has encountered this disappointing dilemma. I am certain that if it was a complete volume, I would be rating book with 5 Stars."
4,Why did the Germans do it?,This book comes as close as anyone to answering why a supposedly civilized nation could act so barbaricly. We shall see.
4,My interest surprised me!,"I hated history in grade school. But was encouraged by a co-worker to try the book. Now, nine months later, I've just completed reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich : A History of Nazi Germany, a fascinating 1100-page collection of details. The style reminds me of James Michener's affinity for detail. Amazing how one person---apparently a close relative to Jiminy Cricket---could have witnessed so much history. The thought of accomplishing what William L. Shirer has overwhelms me.Thanks Mr. Shirier.I'd recommended this book to anyone who is fascinated by human behavior and appreciates detail."
5,Excellent read by someone who experienced this period of history.,"An excellent breakdown of the events leading up to the darkest period in modern history, and the period of expansion and finally destruction of the Reich."
1,"Poor, Biased account of History","This book serves as an unreliable source, and was obviously written by a journalist, not a historian. Reading this book, one can tell it was ""slapped"" together in order to generate a profit. Surely, most of the references and notes in the book were not fully reviewed in archival format. This book glorifies Hitler's rise to power as a ""fly by night"" phenomenon, and insists that German nature is to blame for the rise of the NSDAP (Nazis). It forces upon you, the idea that all Germans are bad natured. For a better account, and more comprehensive account of this period, I reccomend ""Nazi Germany,"" by Klaus Fischer. Fischer's book is well document, and very accurate. Fischer gives a comprehensive review of all the social and economic reasons that contributed to the rise of this politial monster. Fischer's work is also derived from some of the best writings and archival research."
1,"Dated, Boring, Unintentionally Funny.","I picked this up used after the German film ""Downfall"" reawakened a long-dormant fascination with the freakshow that was National Socialist Germany. I was disappointed. Shirer's prose is inelegant and heavy-handed. After about 300 pages, I gave up. But not before reaching this amusing nugget: ""Many of the [S.A.'s] top leaders, beginning with its chief, [Ernst] Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lietenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a covicted muderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and fueded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can."" Good luck getting something like that published in 2005."
5,A fascinating in depth look at the horrors of Nazi Germany.,"This book provides a fascinating look at the terrible war of attrition waged by Hitler and his horrific Third Reich against the very core of Western civilization and culture. It is both historically precise and masterfully written, a true historical classic. As the saying goes, ""Those who do not learn from the past are bound to repeat it."" We should all remember and learn from this tragic period of human history so that we might not have to pay the teriible price that was charged to our progenitors. Shirer's the Rise and Fall provides the perfect backdrop."
3,Tedious,"Although certainly full of detail, this epic account of the Third Reich is often tedious and uninteresting."
1,A Must Read? Try thirty years ago,"It is a very sad thing to see that this ancient, very shalow and badly researched book of Shirer is still considered by many as a source of reliable information about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany. It tells mainly about the level of knowledge about the subject at hand of the people who think that. Shirer's book has but one thing to its credit: it's very well written. A long, charming, feather-weight journalistic report. As a boy, I have read it with fascination. It's a marvelous thing to read when you're 11 years old. It's like the light classical music records you hear when you make your first steps into hearing classical music. But things change and people grow up and just like listening to Peter and the Wolf or the Toy Symphony so with the Rise and Fall. Past a certain age and level of knowledge it is pathetic to consider it a worthy reading material. The book is simply childish."
1,Long and boring.,Although this book may be a classic it is not at all high school reading. It is required reading for my Honors World History class and many honors students are failing to understand this book and are in turn failing the class. Its too long and Shirer rambles on about stupid things. I think it would be better written if he got to the point and didnt beat around the bush.
5,history never lies,"great read, very informative, and makes you feel like this happened yesterday.i highly recommend this to anyone. cant wait for the coloring book to come out....weeeeeeeeeeeeee"
5,Wonderful resource,A one stop reference to all styles and types of lace; the book is jam packed with crisp clear black and white images for artist inspiration.No patterns here - this is for the artists and the needleworker who knows what they are doing or want to do.
4,classic!,"This version of Tarzan was filmed in and around my hometown of Morgan City, LA and that is how I initially became interested in it. I have to admit that using the swamps of South Louisiana is NOT an accurate representation of a jungle, but it suits the film. Actually there are a lot of elements to this version of the film that may seem ""odd"" or ""unusual,"" but that is one of its main beauties. Instead, there is an awesome story-line that follows the book quite well (better than any other version I am told.) Indeed, the movie is crude (it was made almost 70 years before I was even born!) but the strong story-line appears more fluid and noticeable because of this. If you are a purist or an afficianado, you would do well to see this classic! For the rest of us, however, there are other versions that offer more ""Hollywood sheen."" But, of course for the purists, you cannot pass up the chance to see the book ""come to life!"""
5,braiiinnnnnnsss,"I used this to make a brain cake for my daughter's 10th birthday. If you coat it with vegetable oil, it can be used as a mold for melted chocolate/white chocolate. Also used it to mold grey panna cotta for a zombie party. This also came out beautifully."
5,Oh so useful...for EVERYone!,"I LOVE what Max has done on this DVD! It is a useful tool for any and everyone. It is a resource I implement personally and recommend regularly to friends, family and clients to calm the mind, open the heart and energize and heal the body. Max's instruction is clear, concise and is easy to follow and use by people of all ages and physical abilities. You will not be disappointed."
2,Awful,"Pros - 2 receivers, the lights are easy to see across the roomCons - Constant interference, usually bad enough to disturb an exhausted parent's precious few hours of sleep. Batteries never last long. After about a year, both monitors developed shorts and would randomly switch off so that exhausted parents are finally woken by a child's wails from down the hall - NOT the sounds and lights.I don't know why I endured this piece of crap for 20 months. Now that it's finally dead, I'm going to buy something better."
1,Awful,"Spend the extra $$$, you will anyhow after you use this for a while. It started out with a little static and got louder, and louder and even picks up local RADIO, ughhh. Stick with Graco, our Graco works like a charm with no static at all, even with both monitors on, there is never any static on that one. The Fisher-Price model is JUNK."
1,Propaganda - for what that's worth,"Even if you aren't a closet Stalinist, it's still wooden, strident propaganda, and poorly executed. Although it manages to be even more repulsive than this, Mission to Moscow (Warner's contribution at the behest of FDR) is a better example of morbidly interesting propaganda.North Star presents the Soviet land of Oz, complete with dancing, well-fed, collectivized peasants (you half expect to see Shirley Jones make an appearance). Worth seeing -- although not buying -- if you want to see the Big Lie in action. And it's a whoppin' Big Lie too."
4,Excellent,"A must have!!! It help put you scatter taughts in order.It really teaches you how to focus on the things that are really important, while disregarding the insignificant matters and situations."
1,"Trash, not treasure","The seller did not comment on the fact that the book was written in and that the paperback cover was not attached to the pages; it was falling apart....I've enjoyed reading it but traditionally I pass the books I read onto my daughters and vice versa, I will not be sharing this one, I don't think it would make it through the mail one more time."
4,Great except for soundtrack,"I have 6 different DVD's for cats. This one is good, except they should have spent more time on the soundtrack. It is obnoxious, so I mute the sound. I'm a cat sitter and find that my little clients enjoy watching cat DVD's."
2,Cinema Verite ART!,"This has to be the most bizarre avant-garde DVD my cat and I have ever watched. Diamanda Galas, eat your heart out. We're obviously too lowbrow for such artistry as neither one of us really understood this video. Shots roll forward, then back. Bugs walk backwards across the screen with colored bars above and below, then the bugs run in slo-mo and then fast motion. The bars come and go and then we're treated to fish that sing like birds! In fact, all of the animals in this video make bird sounds! What a remarkable commentary on our society. Someone must have really enjoyed that expensive film school education, and it shows!Seriously, skip this sorry DVD and shoot some video with your camera phone down at your local Petco. It'll turn out better than this and will probably be more entertaining for your cat. Even my cat's smart enough to lose interest in this one."
3,I love that I'm the first three star review.,"Because yeah this is a polarising story. I will admit that I picked this book up because it was written by the last lead singer for Boiled in Lead. I was a little apprehensive, reading the back cover. Oh hey, busker goes to Scotland and discovers fairies. Kind of like every other urban fantasy I've read. (Except usually the go-to country is Ireland.)But it's a little different, and he's got a good voice. He occasionally overgeeks on the musical terminology, but he knows what he's talking about. And he writes about addiction in a way that feels real to me. Of course, my experience with heroin is pretty minimal, outside of watching Trainspotting. This story was interesting, and stayed interesting. The characters have lives of their own when they're not on the page, they have depth.The ending... seriously jumps off the tracks, and goes somewhere dark and unexpected. I don't think I like it, but the man's got balls to take it there."
1,NUNCA RECIBÍ EL PAQUETE,"nunca recibí el paquete, lo espere desde hace mas de un mes y nunca llego a mi dirección de casillero."
3,"Good Book, But Dated","As one reviewer here said, this book hasn't weathered the decades well since it first came out. However, I still think it's a good book. The sheer imagination that's apparent here overrides most of the problems with coincidental happenings and with undeveloped characters and events. I loved this book in my youth, and I still like it today. It's worth reading."
3,"A little frustrating, but worthwhile","I don't really like Zelazny's writing style (I am apparently immune to his vaunted wit, and at times I feel like he is just trying to show off his literary education), and 1966 Hugo winner ""This Immortal,"" AKA ""Call Me Conrad,"" is a little slow to get going. The book is also a bit pretentious, ceaselessly bombarding the reader with references to Ancient Greek culture and Romantic poetry, and trying to say something about imperialism, terrorism, and religion. And the characters all seem like jerks.However, the core plot of the novel is good, a violent detective/adventure story, and about 70 pages into its 175 pages it gets pretty interesting and exciting. It is not for everybody, but it is easy to see why its fans are so fond of it. People who think SF can be serious literature, and those who like an adventure story but would like something a little more challenging than the usual thing should certainly give ""This Immortal"" a shot."
2,Lacking something,"This novel takes place in a future Earth where mankind had nearly annihilated the planet in a three day nuclear war. The remaining human population is mostly scattered across other planets under control of the Vegans. Earth's remaining human population lives mostly on islands, as the larger land masses are still too radioactive to live on. This is certainly a promising premise for a science fiction novel, but I really was not able to get into this one. I could not identify well with the characters, and the plot seemed to meander from one point to another with little apparent end in sight. This book somehow tied withDunefor the Hugo Award, but I'm frankly not sure what the voters saw in it. In my opinion the two books are not even in the same league."
4,Yummy,"I got these rice cake because I love crunchy snack that is somewhat healthy. I do put butter on it though. Very tasty. However, if you are expecting a sweet rice cake because it is made of sweet mochi rice, it is not sweet. My kid likes it too."
4,good stuff,"It came on time, but when i opened the box. It was popped open and every where. It works well though. My plants like the stuff during flowering. It can be use for tea or top dressing."
4,nicely illustrated board book,"Was looking for a Christmas book for a toddler; this board book is beautifully illustrated and the last page had a lift-up surprise, cute!"
5,Jan Brett's best book yet !,"As a mother, a home educator and a former public school teacher, I have always loved having Jan Brett's books around. They're lively, they inspire children to look for detail and they entertain in a wholesome manner. When we saw this book at the library, I immediately had to come home and order one for us. I never thought I'd have a new favorite, besides the Mitten, but this one may be it ! :-)"
1,Too Condensed!,"I purchased the board book edition of this delightful story for my littlest readers and only later had occasion to hear the whole story at a library story hour. I had noticed that my edition was unusually choppy for this author and seemed to be missing vital chunks of plot. How disappointing! Gingerbread Baby is a wonderful story, but please buy the paperback or hardcover editions instead. Otherwise, you and your child will miss out on a great thing!"
4,Short and to the point,"7 Basic steps to successful Fasting and Prayer is a practical guide that tells how to reduce eating so as not to hurt your body, and how to resume eating after your fast. Mr Bright suggests that one fast with a purpose and names things to do to find and define that purpose. Surprising in 24 tiny pages."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"One of the best CDs I ever ordered, at a great price. I play it at work. Excellent background music.Relaxing"
4,Tales of Not So Terror,"This is an interesting of tales based loosely on Poe's writings. The first tells of a family reunion-the daughter returns to her family's home to discover dear ole Dad (Price) wandering around a cob web covered filty house in s drunken stupor with Mother Dear rotting in her bed (dead for 26 years). It seems that Dad sent the daughter away after the death of the mother, blaming the child for her death. ...The 2nd is based on the Cask of Amatillado, with the TellTale Heart and the Black Cat thrown in. Peter Lorre play Montressor, a drunken wino, married to a long-suffering wife. price plays Fontunato, a wine connessior. Lorre challenges price to a wine-tasting contest becomes drunk and Price carries him home,...The Case of Mr. Valdemar is the oddest and scariest. Price plays Valdemar, a old man racked with pain who uses a hypnotist, Rathbone, to ease the pain. Price also agrees to be hypnotized at the moment of death. ...A nice way to spend an evening"
5,Window on another world,"I first read the 1965 edition years ago (I found it in an old book shop). I just got it off the shelf to re-read it for the fourth or fifth time, and thought I would check to see if it had come back to life in print. This is a truly marvelous book that provides a window on another world that no longer exists: snow-bound Inuit who have never seen a white man. The scenes, experiences, characters and insights are unforgettable--and all real. Highly recommended."
4,"A Shorter, Sweeter Svejklike Satire","Funny, good-natured look at a bumbling Soviet private sent to guard an airplane which is stuck out in the sticks just prior to the German invasion in 1941. Satirizes all manner of things Soviet, most especially bureaucracy and the pomposity of its upper echelons. Somewhat similar to The Good Soldier Svejk in this respect, but at a much more manageable size and pace. Some really funny bits about Comrade Stalin. Especially recommended for Russian literature devotees, but should be enjoyable to most. There is a sequel called Pretender to the Throne."
5,The Funniest Book I Have Ever Read by a Country Kilometer,"I am a native Russian speaker and have read this is the book in its original form. I was just having a friendly argument with someone and in the process found this. I had no idea some poor SOB translated it into English (I really don't envy him).Now I have no idea how good the translation is and to me it's practically impossible to translate Russian into English well, especially when it's something funny. However, if it's even half as funny in English as it is in Russian it'll be the funniest book you'll ever read.While reading the book I found myself dying laughing 85% of the time to the point where I'd have to stop reading for one or more of the following reasons. I'd get terrible stomach cramps, couldn't see anymore due to the fact that I was completely teary eyed, or go into unending fits of coughing. Enjoy."
4,The Last Lover,"The book was good, it held my attention to the end, but I want to know WHO in the world edited the book? I found more gramatical errors and ""runon"" words in this book than I did when my son was in fourth grade. I originally thought this was one of those ""writer"" things! Then I realized that could not be. The MOST blatant example is on page 290. If a book is good - it's good, but I'll tell you - I'd have been FIRED if I EVER produced a product with so many mistakes. Perhaps the author should think about another publishing house."
4,A Refreshing Look at Our Resources,"In our world of today, which is multi-cultural, fast-paced and global, what more makes sense than listening to the 'inner voice'? Randi convinces the reader to realise the importance of balancing preformance and emotion,which may come as an eye-opener. Many phrases and expressions in the book will strike a chord, which may have been buried in our sub-conscious. The book is full of real-life examples, making it readable and providing the feeling of sharing common experiences with individuals like ourselves."
4,Awesome Item,"I actually bought this used off a friend for 1/2 of what is listed here. At first I was just wanting a great new distortion pedal, and this one had 2 different options built in!Now, as I play often, but through traveling, I don't always have an amp to plug to. Yet, I can patch from this preamp straight to a mixing board/sound board for a great ""amped"" live sound. The preamp and tube inside this thing really makes it sound great. You can get awesome distortion and sustain.I highly recommend this- and best part is the two outputs. Ideally, i plug the ""direct to amp"" to the amp and ""direct to mixer"" to ... well you know. that way i have control as does our tech.You won't be dissatisfied!"
5,Simply essential,An easily understandable and extremely funny look at business on the web and the digital economy of today. This is a good book for anyone wishing to digitally worship Mammon.
2,Trying to hard,"Jesus Christ being crucified upside down on a flaming pentagram? No, it's not Marilyn Manson trying to fit in. It's a Polish heavy metal band known as Hate. I am by no means a Satanist, just a fan of heavy metal. And this, to be quite honest, is just a pathetic atempt at that. This band's predecessors would be quite disappointed. If you are a fan of black metal I would say listen to bands like Mayhem and Burzam (interesting story between those two). However, if you are like me, I still just recommend Metallica, Pantera, Soilwork, and to a more progressive audience Mudvayne. At least these bands have talent and are able to portray talent."
3,"Why can't I turn off the ""timer?""","The other reviews all cover most of the basics, but one thing that keeps this from being a great toothbrush is the incredibly annoying ""timer."" If you brush your teeth in four quadrants for 30 seconds each and stop at exactly 2 minutes, then you'll love this brush (when did it drop to 2 minutes anyway? Dentists recommended 3 minutes when I was in school). If you would rather brush your teeth on your own time, then it's incredibly annoying that the motor skips every 30 seconds and then stutters for a few seconds every 2 minutes."
3,Beware...,"The S-200 does not come with a ""refill storage tower""; the picture is wrong. Instead, it has a tiny charger stand. The toothbrush cleans okay, but I wanted to store the brush-head inside the tower."
1,Receivers aren't reliable!,This baby monitor worked well for about a month. Then we noticed that the receivers weren't holding a charge as long as they used to. Then it got so they had to be plugged in all the time. Now one is completely dead and the other needs to be plugged in or it goes out after a few minutes. We hardly used the things for two months before they went belly up!
1,Waste of Time and Money,"We bought this monitor 2 weeks ago, and I'm already shopping for a new one. The static is NON STOP. We can't hear our son over the static. It's ridiculous. We leave it plugged in during the night and use the batteries during naptimes. The batteries last about 2 days. It beeps constantly, even when the base is plugged in and turned on. (it says it has a far reach, but my sons room is 2 rooms away and it can never seem to find the signal) DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR. Waste of money!!!"
2,2 years and dead,"After 2 years, the speaker is dead on one receiver and both receivers are ""blipping"" due to some unknown interference (we do not have 900 MHz wireless in the house) and the first lights are ALWAYS on. These were fine for almost a year and a half and then they went downhill fast. This gets very annoying at night when you are asleep and the lights are flickering for no reason at all. We are trying to figure out what model to get next and believe that we will go digital next.I read in another review that you should not have the receivers plugged in for more that 13 hours at a time. If this is true, this is truly an absolutely horrible design. We have these plugged in at all times, one in the living room and one in the bedroom."
3,Cd-rom!!! not standard dvd's,"I purchased this because I thought it was a dvd set. It would not play in either my blu-ray player or Sony PS2. The discs read """"Mac/PC Data DVD QuickTime 7 Required."" If the box or description indicated that I never would have bought this. I bought it from a private seller and had to pay for shipping twice (to and from) and a 20% restocking fee. It looks like a good product but I have no desire to watch 9 hours of instruction on a computer."
3,"A very good product, but you need to know something up front","Works very well, but WILL move around the garage floor, either little by little with normal use, or alot if kicked/walked on by family members, pets etc. The fix is easy: $5 at Lowes will get you a special kit that will anchor the mats securly to the floor. Problem solved!"
1,Extremely bad DVD quality,"This movie is 1930's history. It's always fun to see a great cast like Boyer & Lamarr. But this print that was put on DVD is unwatchable. Grainy, jumpy, inaudible, faded - and this is being kind. At one point, there was even a double soundtrack being heard. I strongly advise - let's put a stop to this type of DVD being offered to the public. DVD's are a marvel to watch. It's a crime when you are subjected to this type of mess!!DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,CHEAP PRODUCTION,"I love the movie ""Algiers"". For those who know, there are some authentic touches through gestures and through music of old Algiers. And, any fan of the Charles Boyer/Hedy Lamarr foreign intrigue/exotique film genre will enjoy it immensely. But, this copy might as well have been bought on the streets of Shanghai. The quality of the copy is extremely poor and even more offensive, midway through the film another conversation keeps taking over, what is it? ""DARK SHADOWS"". No mistaking the ""Dark Shadows"" music or Joan Bennett. I recommend that Amazon drop this vendor."
3,Goods ( a DVD) arrived in good order but a bit late (40 days),Goods ( a DVD) arrived in good order but a bit late (40 days )
3,Cannister Set,"I received my set of 3 green cannisters in good condition. When arranging them on my cabinet counter I noticed a difference in color in the largest cannister. It has a blue hue, I would say kind of like a teal blue underneath the green, while the other two are a olive green, which is what I was expecting of all three. I sent an e-mail inquiring about this and did not receive a reply. About a month later I resent the e-mail and asked when I might expect a reply. All of this time later I have not had an answer. This WAS NOT shipped from Amazon. The set is lovely if you don't mind color differences. Because of this I would not recommend."
1,Worst...Movie...Ever!,What in the hell? There are no bugs in this movie! All it is is a bad drug-trip. What a waste of time and money!!
2,Great actors in a not-so-great movie,"Please bring back the old Friedkin!! i.e. the Exorcist, the French connection. I agree with most of the previous negative reviews that have been posted here, especially the numerous plot holes. Friedkin loves to leave the audience guessing but here he just leaves us hanging. These types of movies are actually quite common on the Sc-fi channel, and this is exaclty where ""Bug"" belongs....not on the big screen."
3,Bug DVD,"It was packaged well and played okay, but the movie itself was terrible. The previews for this movie were the only good parts. Ashley Judd was great, but it just wasn't that good of a plot. The ending was awful."
1,How did this even get released?,"This was the one of the worst films ever made. Yes, that sounds a bit overboard, but I must say that the time lost watching this garbage was truly put to waste. Psychological thrillers can envelop and intrigue, but this was just an absolute joke. Clean your keyboard, study the art of candle melting, anything but wasting your time on this thing."
1,beyond awful,this movie wouldnt even get a rating but with this review i had to at least pick one star. the movie is poorly written and the acting is definately the worst that i have ever seen. and i am a big ashley judd fan but this movie was the biggest waste of five dollars and i thank god that i did not pay full price for it or i might still be puking .
1,STOMP THIS BUG!,"I am an avid movie collector. This is by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life! What was a wonderful actress like Ashley Judd thinking when she made the decision to take on a role in this film? Even though her performance was very convincing, the whole storyline dragged out and was way too far fetched. I made sure that I returned this movie extra early to get the dollar credit!"
3,Strange Different... good!,"I heard nothing but bad things about this movie by a few friends who saw it. I decided to give it a try and judge for myself. I found the movie to be a really compelling movie about mental illness. I thought the trailer and advertising campaign was totally misleading leading people to believe it was a horror movie where you would expect some alien species or some crazed bugs attacking people ala The Swarm. It was nothing like that at all. Also, I have heard when reading a critique of the play that it was a black or dark comedy. I didn't see this at all and didn't think there was anything funny about it at all. I thought it was good. I recommend it but I do think that it is not for everybody. There is a lot of disturbing material here."
1,The worst movie I have ever watched,I wasted 2 hours of my live. If I could I would not give it any stars.
1,Time stolen,"I have never felt indebted to by someone I did not personally know, but William Friedkin owes me two hours of my life back. Bug joins ""Wicker Man"" and ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" as one of the worlds most deceptively advertised movies, and certainly one of the worst. This is the worst possible genre Hollywood has ever come up with; The Statement. There is supposed to be a message in a Statement, but I've not been able to discern it in Bug.The movie unwinds interestingly enough, but then seems to go nowhere. Plot elements clash; Why does the doctor smoke hash? Seems unusual for a medical professional, at least in public. Why does the very dangerous ex-con boyfriend not just toss the loony bugman out? What is the point of this somewhat disgusting and very disturbing movie?William, if you are reading this, feel free to contact me. We can work out the cost of the two hours, and maybe I can fill you in on what movie making is supposed to give the viewer."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,By far the worst movie/dvd I have ever seen. like the other reviewers I want my 2 hrs of life back.
4,"good, but could have been written better","This book was truly haunting, because it is so realtistic. It could happen. Because of this book, every time a kid walks outside alone, you have to wonder if some sick, pervert preacher is going to grab him or her and put them through years of hell and violence. The thing that I didn't like about it though, was that it was not that well-written. It's popular fiction, not nessscarily enlightening."
4,Great author,Really like her books...another great one that keeps you in suspense until the end...I am anxious for a new one hopefully soon
2,a ride to nowhere,"while the book is in every way a page turner, it is so unsatisfying in the process, you can see the end coming, every part of it has neon signs pointing the way, and even the twists and turns and labyrinth are predictable. it is rather like any old tv series; you get what you came for; you know the characters will get out fine in the end.what is irksome, is the good and evil. if this is truly the way our mature adults are thinking no wonder we are being led so far from any intelligent choices as a nation.i guess one could say that mhc is pointing out the foibles of our tv evangelists and warning people who would enjoy a book like this that they should hardly trust the man behind the pulpit with the expensive suit.that could be considered a public service!if you really enjoy this, i will endeavor to avoid other books that make your hit parade."
2,Disturbing,The first couple chapters about a 4 yr. old being kidnapped and sexually/physically abused made me so sick that I could not continue on with the story.
4,A readable outline,"The definition of philosophy varies according to the philosophy we adopt, says Russell. So then --- there are some general problems which people find interesting, and which do not belong to any of the special sciences, and these problems raise doubts about what we consider knowledge. The definition and exploration of this problems is philosophy. With this introduction, Russell discusses some problems: the physical world, man from without (environment), man from within (consciousness, emotions, ethics etc) and so on. An outline is clearly limited, and Russell does not include many branches of philosophical enquiry such as metaphysical inquiry and some aspects of authority and state. But within its constraints, the book is still a good read."
5,"Clever, Crafty and Funny","Only Chevy Chase could get away with this superb comedy. He is perfectly cast in this clever, witty and crafty masterpiece that went from the stage to the screen. For that matter, the entire cast is excellent including Penelope Ann Miller, Joanne Rubino, Rebecca Wisocky, Armand Assante, Robert Loggia, Christopher McDonald, Alex Meneses, Kevin Sussman and Guy Torry. What would you do with $5 million in dirty money? Find out what Chevy does with it. Great comedy...a must for Chevy fans."
5,Good book.,I must agree with the reviewers below that the title is misleading. I would suggest that you read Word Power Made Easy first. After that you will be able to rip through the book a lot faster.
3,Misleading title,"While you can certainly finish the book in 30 days, you'll most likely forget the vocabularies in at least half of the chapters by the time you are done. The quiz in each chapter is useful. The diagnostic test at the beginning of the book can crush your self-esteem - which is to be redeemed after reading the book. ""30 days"" in the title is misleading, because readers probably need to go through the chapters again and again to make sure they truly remember the words. So make it ""45-50 days to a more powerful vocabulary""!Furthermore, believe it or not: it is not a bad cram book if you have less than 3 months to study for SAT or GRE! I find vocabulary builders (such as this title) much better study tools for SAT or GRE than conventional exam preparation guides like Princeton Review or Barron's - at least for the verbal section."
4,Ole!,Beautiful spanish flamenco guitar! This is one of the best flamenco guitar cd's I have ever heard. Very Romantic!
5,Jimmy Stewart book,"I am a huge Jimmy Stewart fan...and I loved this book. Mr. Stewart read one of these poems, Beau, on the Johnny Carson show, and cried as he was reading it. It is a touching poem of his love for his dog."
2,Iaido,"Actually, this book wasn't what i expected, you'll get bored from all that reading. Also, iaido is not a straightforward art, i don't see that emphasized. Every situation has a different bunkai, it's really a mental building system. And that's why i like books like e.g. Aikido: Harmony of Nature by Saotome Sensei. Also i'm quit sure there are some mistakes in that book regarding the naming of some kata's."
4,Iaido Sword: Kamimoto-Ha Techniques of Muso Shinden Ryu,"I dont study MSR, I study Mugai Ryu, but to find GOOD books in english on Mugai Ryu is extremely difficult(only so many ways you can cut). As a reference guide, this book is really good, it's all there, history, philosophy, etiquette and technique etc. The only issue I have, is that 90% of the text from page 217 is missing, as that is a judging guide, it doesn't bother me too much. All in all, a good book for any iai practitioner"
4,Eric Burdon is still an Animal,The way Eric Burdon sings from his throat it's amazing his voice is still intact. He is as better than ever. Not his best album but anything by him is better than 90% of the stuff out there.
2,Save your money 'cuz you aint missing a thing here!!,"Im more of a classic AE fan. stigmata, Burning Bridges, etc. this album is just way to ""nu"" metal for me. It still has some classic AE moments (nice solo here, cool riff there) But if your a fan like me than dont even waste your time. It basically just picks up where Wages left off. A song will start off with a good hook and then it just looses ya. It seems like the Amott bros. dont even try anymore. In comparison to their other stuff, its a waste of money. but if your into this kinda music than by all means, knock your self out. whatever floats your boat I guess."
4,Tracklist,Where is the track list for this cd? If anyones knows it can you type it in as a review? thanx
3,ok..and better than the last,"this is an ok cd, not every song is good, but its still better than the last cd, which only the first four songs were good."
5,Best Arch Enemy,Even though it's older It remains one of my favorite. Very strong throughout. I recommend to any Hardcore Metal fan. 2 thumbs up!!!
2,Owners Manual,"We purchased our Veranda stainless steel gas grill two years ago, we like the size but have not had good luck using it. We would like to have an owner's manual giving temperature settings, recipes, etc. We have not found it to be user friendly. We have had other gas grills with permanent briquets & wish we had purchased another rather than Veranda."
2,Creates holes but not plugs.,"Clogs on very first try.Punches into the ground relatively well - no plug pushes our. The whole engineering of this thing was badly done. I can see alternatives in my mind that certainly would work better than the design of this product.The whole point of core/plug aerating is to produce a plug.. not compound the problem by smashing holes in your lawn and compacting it more - you could just use a spike aerator for this and avoid the compacting problem. Core aeration should bring the bottom soil to the surface and not clog on the first operation. Too much work to constantly unclog it.. so you end up 'aerating' the lawn by pushing a hole... not cutting a hole.Basically a waste of money if you want true core aeration. As mentioned previously, you are better off taking your money and going to a rental shop and renting a 'real' gas powered aerator for same amount."
2,Only buy used or at a discount,"There are better books and websites out there. Only buy this book if you can get it at a discount. Don't know how many times students have been scratching their heads wondering where the author came up with a word. Good as a reference book, for ideas, but we do not use book much because there are better books."
2,So many choices....,So many choices in this venue. I think it would be best to review some in a book store to determine if your choice suits your audience.
3,ehhh good book but bring your no dose,Not as captivating as most other rich dad books I read but I'd put the house up that the information is accurate and very detailed. Good book but bring your no-dose.
3,The only dry book in the Rich Dad advisors,"I love Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but this book was dry and WAY BORING.The information was useful enough for me to understand the importance of hiring a qualified professional to patent my creative work. Which I understood after about 2 pages.So read this review and understand that it is vitally important to not cheap out on protecting a big idea with a solid patent. Now that you've read that sentence, save your money for a different Rich Dad, Poor Dad book. My Favorite: Retire Young, Retire Rich."
5,Great for any code lyoko fan!,"The episodes are in great clarity! It has all season two episodes, which include the epidoes: new order, uncharted territory, exploration, a great day, mister puck, st. valentines day, final mix, missing link, the chips are down, marabounta, common interest, temptation, a bad turn, attack of the zombies, ultimatum, a fine mess, xana kiss, vertigo, cold war, deja vu, tip top shape, is anybody out there, franz hopper, contact, revelation, and the key.If you are code lyoko fan I would recomend this item; along with the other seasons."
3,This isn't all that bad,"Yes, it is an official bootleg recording and the sound suffers mostly due to the fact that this was recorded on cassettes straight from the mixing board. I disagree however with the opinion that this sounded worse on record. The original Japan import of this I had years ago on record actually sounded better. Thank you Tower records. I think that this is probably due to the fact since cds have a higher resolution rate they tend to make albums that were subpar recordings sound even more so. The remastering team of Fripp and company did the best they could. If you want a better sounding live album check out King Crimson's official web site and purchase one of the collector's club releases from this time. However, keep in mind that the performances on here are actually pretty good to great. Schizoid Man rocks real hard. Sailor's Tale has some great guitar work by Fripp.Groon show that King Crimson is the ""prog rock"" British equal to the Grateful Dead."
1,Why do they charge money for this?,Welcome to the King Crimson Endurance Test. The only live release more trying is ThrakAttack. You have been warned.
4,Great album by this longtime DC act,"I was introduced to Tone by a friend/former coworker who is one of the guitarists. While this may make some think my review would be biased, it's actually the complete opposite. I am even more critical of the music because of this.Tone is a unique band to say the least. They are a an all-instrumental group consisting of 2 drummers, a bassist, and 5 (!!!!) guitarists. The result is an impressive wall of sound. The depth that is provided by the layers and layers of guitars is amazing. Most of the songs start ""slow"", and build with a steady progression, until finally exploding. While the style of some of the tracks isn't really my thing, I thoroughly enjoy this album more so on every listen than the last."
3,Not to die for,"The cookie is tasty, but from a previous reviewer, I had expected to be in heaven over the fudge. Unfortunately it was a big let down, not enough deep chocolate taste, although rich."
1,Locked up two computers,Works fine in Sony Nex camera but when inserted into card reader crashes computers.Strange think it worked ok at first. Two weeks.
2,Pricing,Frequent price is $10 per GB with good speed. So $80 is reasonable for a fast loading chip. It is not reasonable for a slow chip.
1,"Does not work in a Palm TX, IBM Z60m, Canon S2 IS, or Dell Inspiron 6000","I read the reviews for the TS4GSD150 (the 4GB version of this card) and it seemed that that version seemed to work perfectly in Palms.. ..so I tried this 8GB version hoping for the same results. Unfortunately, after two cards and a whole lot of frustration, I now realize that these do not work in the current generation of Palms, Canon cameras (I tried it in my new Canon S2 IS), IBM laptops (new Z60m), or a Dell Inspiron 6000 series.Sooo, I'm not really sure what this card is suppose to work in. Maybe the stuff coming out later this year will be compatible. Until then, stick the with TS4GSD150 4GB version."
1,incompetent uploader,"I am currently trying to return this book for a refund. The text is very good, but the person who uploaded it is incompetent. The book was obviously scanned from a dtb. that is fine but the scanning errors were not corrected. The big problem is that when you upload a book to Amazon, you must download it, correct the HTML, and then reupload it. This was not done. The result is a book where the paragraphs are not indented. The text of this book is good enough that I would live with that if it were a free or inexpensive book but at just under $15 that is intolerable.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick"
5,Off the radar awesome funk,"This is a great way to sample a large range of funk. This is REAL funk, besides the same James Brown and George Clinton songs you've heard over and over. Not to say that those two guys aren't important to how funk came about but they are just the snowflake at the tip of the iceberg. This collection (and I highly recommend the second collection as well) will give you a feel of what exists under the tip of the iceberg. Great, great selection and hours of stellar off-the-radar funk. Do yourself a favor and discover funk once more."
5,"Readable, funny, informative, unique","This memoir probably infuriates many in the art world. I'm sure Hebborn would have infuriated me, in person. But the guy could write! I come across hardly any art books, especially by artists, that are written in an engaging everyday style. Hebborn could have been a journalist, but he just happened to be poor-born, misfitted, delinquent, driven, selfish, witty, and a bloody genius with pencil and paintbrush. I think I have read it cover to cover five times, always with pleasure. I find myself agreeing 95% with Hebborn's pronouncements; the missing 5% concerns what seem to be excuses and evasions. It is also a terrific guide through art history, and through art education. You don't have to be schooled in art to enjoy and learn from this book. Hebborn had an adventurous, hilarious, hedonistic life, which ended violently and not, in his prescient comments, unexpectedly early.Read it."
5,Highly recommended,"I am very pleased with this purchase. Although I have passed the InterDev exam, I never really understood a lot of it until I read Reselman's book. He really has a knack of explaining complex concepts. The book starts off quite basic, but by the end you have built a quite useful interactive web site. All the source code is on-line and so far it all seems to work fine. At a manageable 575 pages, it only half the size of some of the big ASP tomes, but then it is only about half the price."
5,Satisfied,Was prompted to get this history of Nashville after purchasing the Collection of Carl and otto Giers Volume II. Was just as pleased with this purchase.
1,"Cheap!, Cheap!!, Cheap!!!","I ordered the 6 piece set and it is all nice except this hamper. It is very cheaply made and does not take much for it to fall in on itself. It is honestly not useable but if you just want something for the look buy this hamper, some wood glue and some rubber bands and you are good to go."
4,Twists and Turns!,I thought I had figured it out at least 10 or 15 times and was still completely astounded by the ending of this book! What a ride! This was great fun!
1,A big letdown,"After reading ""The Devil Went Down to Austin"" I was excited to discover Rick Riordan. Good writing and well-drawn characters. Cold Springs was a huge disappointment. The characters were neither very believeable nor were they likeable. Chadwick just didn't ring true and the daughters? -- tell me again why copying Katherine's addictive behavior was so compelling to Mallory? The story was a muddle."
1,disappointing,"I have read this authors previous novels and enjoyed them very much. This book ,however, was a tedious lesson in morality. I finished it but only by gritting my teeth. The only thing that would have improved this book is editing, to the bone preferably."
1,Nasty stuff,"I can not say much more about this stuff that has not already been said. It stinks. It has bad ingredients... This company seeks to trick people by using the name ""organic"" instead of actually being organic. I will not be supporting them in their trickery. ""Off to the trash"""
1,Blech,Save your money. Dreadful nasty stuff. I used once and threw the remainder in the trash. Terrible smell and bad feel on hair after rinse.
1,It doesn't get any worse than this video,"Okay, I didn't watch the whole movie but the moment that ""Big Bird"" appeared on the screen in the theater I grabbed my stuff and left. This movie was so bad I was trying to gouge out my eyes with a box of ""Dots"". It's very slow and painful, the only worse movie publicly available would be Manos: The Hands of Fate which at least has a redeeming quality in that it ends sooner than this horrid waste of a movie."
2,new age mumbo-jumbo,"I found that there isn't much concrete in this book. One of those ""find your authentic self"" books. I prefer the ""Parachute"" books."
3,"Good brush, but pricey","I love the Oral B Sonic system. The brushes work well, but they are pricey. Amazon had the best price I could find, but at over $6 a brush, they are expensive."
5,Oral-B sonic brush heads,They're good brush heads. They are the ones that work with my toothbrush so that's why I purchased them. Amazon has the best price I've found.
5,Sonic brush replacement,very satified with both the timeliness of shipping and the quality of the product. would definately place more orders for refills with this company
1,Too Expensive,"This is a good brushing system, but only if you keep the costs to a minimum. At $5 per brush, the $14+shipping for this is a TOTAL RIPOFF. Do not overpay for these brushes, they are not worth it."
4,They hold up well.,"While the packaging had been cheaped out, the bristles hold up well to justify the price, and the price was under the competitors that I researched."
3,Oral B SR18-3 toothbrush heads,"It does the job, but very expensive; we are trying to find an alternate source."
5,Perfect,Couldn't find these brush heads anywhere. Got them at Amazon for a cheap price and fast delivery. Perfect!
4,"OK, but all the same colour","Difficult to think of anything too exciting to say about toothbrush heads, but my dentist recommends this brand. My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head so they do not get mixed up. The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 302311cm, which annoyed me a great deal. Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful. Also, the P&P charge was about $5."
5,Very Pleased!,"I had been looking for these replacement heads for a couple years, being very frugal with the few I had left. I don't know why it took me so long to think to check on Amazon, but I'm glad I did. I thought I was going to have to get a new toothbrush for a lack of replacement heads. I really don't think there is any difference between these and the ones I bought at a store. I am very happy with them. They fit my toothbrush perfectly."
2,"Nice, but doesn't sound original","I like this type of music. However, as the saying says ""the original is almost always better than the copy"". This applies also to this CD, namely Rock Voisin is better."
1,dissapointment,"I bought this movie based off a few reviews i read..., man was I really dissapointed. This mvie was a poor man's Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone has nothing to fear with this movie. I am a Rose Mcgowan fan, however seeing her naked was not enuff to save this movie. Rent it first or check for an auction bargain...!"
1,Over-The-Top is the absolute understatement,"I rented this movie basically because of the fact that it touted itself as a ""road flick,"" a genre that I'm usually a fan of. I'll admit the gratuitous violence in the beginning had me laughing just because of how corny it was presented, but this wore itself out several minutes later. The film tries to loosely have some kind of ""hell"" theme by continuously referring to $6.66 as payment for different items they buy along the way. We get it. You didn't have to do it 7 times. I wasn't sure exactly what theme the writer was trying to convey, but it doesn't matter because the story it was based on was so bad anyway. The filmmakers try to use shocking visuals and group sex to (I guess) grab the attention of the audience, which is good because it diverts that attention away from the terrible story that's going on. Don't waste your time."
4,biting social satire at it's best.,"This may very well be the most existentialist movie I have ever seen, Complete with sex, cigarettes, coffee, and more references to hell than The Bible. Araki ranks with Sartre and Voltaire as one of the most biting political comentators ever."
2,I like it for one reason...,"I think that there is only one good thing in that movie... Rose McGowan. I thought it was very disturbing, discusting, and very bothersome. My favorite part had to be the creidits! I think that Rose McGowan can do a lot better."
5,i feel bad for people who dont get this movie,"this movie's awesome but got a bad rep. from the WRONG VIEWING AUDIENCE.its says alot without saying anything specific.dare to interprit something. itll undoubtly make it a fun experience.there's so much anger in this world created by gregg araki, but there is so much empathy for these characters.the acting is campy on purpose, but some people cant get over it.unh! there. i just got over it.enjoy this movie! its a rollercoaster ride! the emotions presented by the characters are moving and brilliant! youll gasp, cry and get disgusted too. its really surreal yet familiar.has theme's that ""brokeback mountain"" had, but done more brilliantly as x and jordon revolve around each other in a haze of homosexual attraction that... is ultimatly punished for.you can never guess whatll happen next and.. theres some hot guys and girls in it too.remember: not liking ""doom generation"" is bad for smart people."
1,"Why no ""zero star"" rating Amazon???","See what Tarantino hath wrought with this uninspired, illogical, unfunny, moronic masterpiece of bad cinema. Quite possibly the worst, most incompetent film ever made, there are literally NO scenes that warrant rediscovery or further commentary. Poorly acted, boring, and utterly self-conscious, I have rarely been this bored and outraged at the same time. Tries so desperately to be hip and ""GenX-ish"" that I cringed at least once every few seconds. Like, you know, we get it already."
1,Top of the list.,"This movie easily tops the list as the worst movie I have ever seen. There has never been a more grotesque or ridiculously disgusting movie ever made. Anybody who gives this movie any positive credit should seriously have their head examined. The violent and sexual content involved in this movie deserve much worse than an ""R"" rating. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE YOU WILL REGRET IT. Movie-going will never be the same."
1,Here we go again......,"yet another homosexual ""artist"" who makes the arrogant claim that beneath the facade of all heterosexuals lies a raging homosexual waiting to burst forth. Sick, demented, ugly, pointless film will appeal only to those who believe ""angry"" is synonomous with ""brilliant"" and the inclusion of graphic violence is somehow revolutionary or ultra-hip. Get a clue Generation X, you do not have the abilities in the filmmaking departnment. Please, for all of us, go back to flipping burgers."
1,Two hours of your life you'll never get back...,"This is, without a doubt, one of THE worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot of bad movies). While at first I was disgusted with what an impotent idiot James Duval must be, I then realized that I had no one to blame but myself...no one held me down and made me watch this. I do get a little laugh out of the fact that someone actually edited this piece of ... and thought that this was good. All I can say is that I'm glad I watched it on cable...at least I didn't pay to want to open a vein."
1,Would give it less if I could,"I won't say too much about this movie. To do so would give it respect. Saw this in the theatre. Poor plot, poor movement, poor writing. You get the idea. Waste of time."
3,Decent sequel,"Night of the Demons 2 is a decent sequel is just as good as the excellent first. Angela is back at Hull House and a bunch of teens at a Catholic school are the victims. They all are killed or possessed and then the survivors must battle them all. The movie's highlights are the good makeup effects by Steve Johnson and the production design. This one is a real keeper but hard to find since it is out of stock, look hard a your nearest video store(Blockbuster mainly) and buy/rent."
1,boring with a capital B,"ok, we got the dumb original's plot, now we get the dumb sequels plot. this one has a supersoaker slinging nun, which is pretty funny if dumb and the huge snake turning thing at the end is cheesy, plus with the lipstick in the final shot is uproarous. good ideas fellas"
4,Good movie,I thought Night of the demons 2 was a pretty good movie..but the only thing i didnt like is having a Kung Fo Nun in the movie but Night of the Demons the first movie is still better than this one...but i liked both movies
4,Good value for the money.,Ample supply for the price and will last a long time. It is a must and does save the blades.
5,Lifetime Supply!!!,"How can I not give this product 5 stars? It's a reasonably priced, name-brand product; which should last me for the rest of my life!"
2,No Power,The below statement is a Joke. It could NOT remove the lug nuts on my new Silverado.Granted they were torqued above specs and my 250 # torque wrench but I ended up braking them lose with a breaker bar.I bought this to replace a cheapo Impact and at the end of the day it's not much better.I'm Very disappointed.(550 Ft-Lbs Maximum TorqueThe 2130 provides an impressive 550 ft./lbs. of maximum torque (50 - 500 ft./lbs. working torque) to tackle the tough jobs.)
4,Well built impact wrench,"This is a well built impact wrench that I have been using on my car projects. It removes lug nuts from my 3/4 ton pick up without a sweat. It is heavy, but that is what you should expect from a ""Heavy-Duty"" tool. My only complaint is that impact sockets seem to be difficult to remove when changing sockets. Instead of the ball and spring that holds on the socket, there is a kind of heavy wire wrapped around the anvil that holds the socket on. Maybe with more use it will break-in and loosen up a bit, but right now it doesn't want to let go of a socket without a struggle.So far I'm happy with the wrench and it sure makes life easier when removing nuts from old vehicles."
2,Really???,"I purchased the impact for the 550 ft lbs. The impact was not at all powerfull. I was decieved by the comments and the price. Buyers beware. If you want a powerfull impact, this is not the route!!!"
5,Excellent.,"This book has no fluff. It is packed with great information that will help you become more assertive. I highly recommend this book. It is worth every penny. As you can see, I am a verified buyer and not a friend of the author. If you look at my other reviews you will see I have no problem blasting authors that shouldn't be wasting our time with crap. Some of the situations in this book are dated but don't let that stop you. Get it."
3,Mine was too small,"I shopped by ""medium"" size and it was still small enough for a tiny dog. Since it cost $10 to ship it, I kept it rather than returning it for another $10 and waiting for a return. Its cute though. The picture makes it look deceivingly taller than it is. Only a few inches off the floor."
3,Leaves something to be desired,The dog's choker collar keeps catching on it and then she picks it up and it falls apart. Water everywhere.
3,Double Diner,"I loved how the bowls looked in my family room, however, this didn't really work for us. My dogs made a mess with their food and water. I think it was just too high off the ground for them. I have medium sized dogs. I gave it to a friend that has a large dog and it is working fine for their dog."
3,Favorite Becker Cd.,"I liked this Cd by margaret Becker it had some good lyrics and a couple of songs i really liked. I like the songs ""Friend For Life"" and ""Hope in a Hopeless World."" This is not a bad CD for fans of Margaret Becker or fans of contempory pop albums."
3,"Very amusing, but there are a number of spelling errors","This text is absolutely hilarious, and also right on point. I purchased this text not 20 minutes ago, and have already had a number of chuckles. The illustrations also look great on the Kindle; each character's description is paired with a well-drawn picture.However, in mere minutes I found a number of spelling errors. For example, go to the last page of the ""Unseasonable"" character-- ""Sbould he have a mind to dance..."" or the first page of the ""Grumbling"" character-- ""he grudged me soup and wretched beer, or be would have asked me to dinner.""If it didn't have a multitude of spelling errors, I would have given this book a good 4 or 5 stars. The table of contents functions perfectly and enables you to zip around the text, the pictures are very good, and the text itself is a pleasure to read. At the end, you can also boast that you've read some Theophrastus. ;)"
3,A fair book for her first,"By now you know that Carey writes very well and she is not exclusive to sci-fi. This was her first Trek story and the critics will always be there. What really needs critics is the books that are pumped out that are just scripts of the TV series. And for you collectors out there, the cover on this book features the BattlestaR GALACTICA upside down."
2,Characters traits are all wrong,"What makes this book difficult to read is the author's interpretation of the characters. Picard appears as a grumpy old man. Riker is insecure. Data is overly emotionally sensitive for an android who doesn't have feelings. The book also relies on Wesley, who is particularly more stupid and annoying than usual. The plot is ok, but the inaccuracies are too distracting to fully enjoy the book."
1,Horrible,"This is the first of the next generation books and also the worst. The author puts too much attention on the crews' feelings for each other. The author should have focused more time on developing a good story, which this author obviously did not do. I felt it was a waste of my time and i am surprised i actually finished this book. This book is a waste of time and the paper it was written on"
3,Fantasy and Discrimination,"I enjoyed the story, even though I think it is written more for middle school than for high school readers. It certainly begs for a sequel - which I see is now out, The Bonemender's Oath. I will be reading it to see how Ms. Bennett continues the story."
5,Operational,I make cupcakes for company holiday parties and this is a simple tow and display for consumption. The top rack does bend in the middle from weight so I make those the light cakes with little frosting.
1,Original AND replacement arrived broken,"I ordered one of these for my mother for Christmas. It arrived with the clear plastic cracked on the sides. I returned that today and received the replacement today. The replacement is ALSO cracked. There is no cushioning for this item in the box - only the clear plastic bag it comes in - so no wonder they're broken. I have asked for a refund, and suggest that anyone looking to purchase an item like this (which otherwise looks like it would do what it's supposed to) someplace that doesn't require shipping or properly packages their items for shipping."
3,"The first Spenser novel that rates a ""Fair"" revue.","I have read or listened to every Spenser novel and this is the first one I would rate less than ""Good"" or ""Very Good"".The usual banter is there between Spenser and Hawk but the ending leaves much to be desired. At the end you wonder just what, if anything, has been accomplished. There are some moments of suspense and, with all the white spaces between mini-chapters, the 291 page novel is a fast read."
4,A Reunion With Old Friends,"For those of you who are already fans of Parker's witty, aging detective, Spenser, this is another classic tale. Spenser's assignment, the murder of a woman twenty-eight years ago, lacks freshness. But, the chance to meet up again with some of the classic characters - Spenser, Susan, Hawk, Quirk, Vinnie - is well worth the read. They are as charming and multi-faceted as ever. Their faults are human and their loyalties unshakeable.For those who are new to the Spenser series, this novel may appear lacking. It requires at least some familiarity with the characters to really understand what's going on. Otherwise, things like Spenser's agreeing to take on a dangerous case and risk his own life for six Krispy Kreme donuts may seem implausible. However, Spenser and his contacts are worth getting to know. I would recommend to anyone new to the series go back and read some of the old Spenser novels. They are still fun reads today - fast paced, introspective, witty and delightful."
2,"Enough, Already","Parker came upon a unique and clever idea when he befan writing the Spenser series. The characters were of interest and the plots well tailored. Although this series would never be confused with great, or even good literature, it was always good for a fast and harmless read. It seems as if the writer is going to the well far too often. The story is more miss than mysyery and the story becomes tedious at times. The story is rather predictable and this entry lacks the snappy writing style that was so evident in the earlier books of this series. The characters are like oft-used stereotypes andthere is little development of them. It was a good run yet appears to be time to give this character a rest."
2,Not even close.,"Spenser needs to retire. For those who haven't bothered to notice: it you would compare the physical descriptions of Spenser with the pictures of Parker on the back of the dust jacket you will get the distinct impression Parker is basing Spenser to a great degree on himself. Spenser, as he has said himself, was with MacArthur at Inchon. This makes him at least 70.This latest entry is a bit of a letdown. No mention is made of Spenser's cooking abilities. And absolutely nothing is said about the details of the deal Spenser made with the aging crime boss at the end of the novel.This novel is a pleasant, but like another reviewer has said already: if you really want to read it borrow it from the local library or get it in paperback when it comes out."
3,"Comfortable Like an Old Shoe, But Not Much Bite","Another Spenser novel, much like the last few. Some good dialogue, some drama, but the same old formula with Hawk as bodyguard, and others assigned to protect Susan while Spenser rubs some bad guys the wrong way. Yada yada yada."
5,Great and Inspirational Book,"Terrific companion to ownership thinking. The truth is, we are all playing a game when it comes to business, so why not set it up so that the whole team knows if it is winning or losing and have some fun while you are at it?"
5,CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY,"CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a GREAT story! It's all about a little boy named Charlie who's poor with his family. All he wants in life is to bite into one of Willy Wonka's delicious candies. And then, eventually, he DOES! Because Wonka's having a contest. He's hiding five Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars. And whoever finds them will take a tour through the entire Wonka Factory! And Charlie's one of the winners! But the other four winners aren't like Charlie at all. They're bratty! There's greedy Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, unkind Violet Beaureguarde, and selfish Mike Teavee. But don't worry. They'll get all the punishments they deserve. Because Wonka has a few tricks up his amazing sleeves!"
4,Gruesome Fun,"Never mind the painfully literal film version: Charlie's adventures in the chocolate factory are more akin to the Brothers Grimm than popular cinematic fantasy. Both children and adults will be amused by the appropriate symbolic way in which the wicked are punished and the good rewarded. An excellent ""read aloud"" book that older children--and grown-ups too--will enjoy reading on their own as well!"
3,Never Got It,"We were looking for the 40th anniversary addition, but that was not what we received.We love this book (one of our daughters already has it and we were looking to get another copy for our other daughter).This book is awesome and I wish it was actually available (hard to find and iffy as to whether it can still be gotten. Just as we thought we had located a copy it turned out not to be the right one). There might be one out there, we did not have the time to wait as our second daughter was needing it for a school project. So for those that can track down the real copy, get it (and congratulations on finding it).Even though we had the ISBN number which was posted that was not the ISBN numbered book we received.Book Great, listing in Amazon and seller poor.That is why the rating of 3."
4,Luck is Luck,"It was luck for Charlie Bucket to get to the Chocolate Factory. Charlie is a poor kid he barely gets enough food to eat until he is lucky enough to go to the chocolate factory because it was closed for many years until the owner, Mr. Wonka, gave five ticket to come to his factory. Charlie finds alot of amazing thigs and has alot of adventures. It was a great book"
5,Chalie and the Chocolate Factory,"Harry Potter 1 book review by Bobby MillerDo you like ? Well if you do then this book will be perfect for you. This book is filled with exciting adventures between Harry and his friends Ron and Hermonie. This book is about a boy who lives with his relatives because his parents are . While he's at his relative's house he gets a letter that says he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During his time at Hogwarts he encounters a giant, a troll, and a three headed d... well, you'll find out what has three heads when you're reading the book. So if you think that you're a fantasy kind of guy then you'll love the Harry Potter series."
4,A Good Book for Children,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was number one of all books I ever read. I don't read a whole lot but as a young student who puts everything we read in school aside, I couldn't put this book down. I would highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys laughter, sadness, and exciting endings. I didn't want the the book to end although I love the ending when one of the five kids was good and the other four kids were bad. I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a very good book. I would recommend it to anybody who likes funny books. I really liked it. My favorite part is when they went into this place where everything you could eat and there was a chocolate river."
4,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Chalie and the Chocolate Factory is writt4en by Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl has written other books such as, James and the Giant Peach, The Witches, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Charlie and the Glass Elevator. All of these books have humor and splendid plots.Charlie, a poor boy who lives with his parents and grandparents, finds the last golden ticket. The ticket allows him to have a tour in the famous Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Four other lucky winners and himself get the tour. Crazy things happen to the five winners.The book has similarities to the movie, but the book is much, much better. I recommend this book to kids in the age of 8-12, and people that like humorous books. This book is so funny that you might laugh out loud without even trying to."
5,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Handi-read),Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Handi-read) by Roald Dahl is one of my favorite books of all time and tells the adventures of Charlie Bucket and the time he visited Mr. Willy Wonkas chocolate factory. This is an awesome tale that teaches children morals and values without beating them over the head. Reading the story as an adult I can not truly see the hardship that Charlie has to suffer prior to coming to the factory and this is in itself is the hallmark of inteligent social commentary. I love the story and the illustrations and I consider this one of the better childrens stories of all time that can be read from ages 6-99.
3,The book is very descriptive and creative.,"Once you progress through the beginning of the book, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is very captivating. Some people think it is a terrible book because the beginning is repetitive. However, other people believe it is one of Roald Dahl's best creations. Most readers enjoy the part in the story where Charlie Bucket discovers the golden ticket. In the end, Charlie recieves the chocolate factory for his extraordinary display of honesty."
4,Charlie and the chocolate factory,What great imagination!! A very fun adventure story told beautifully. A must read for anyone with an imagination. A classic!!
4,reading the book after seeing all the movies,"I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my 4 year old son, and we were not disappointed with Dahl's story. However, the illustrations were a bit quirky and did not appeal to him. The sparse, black and white sketches seemed inaccessible to a younger reader."
4,Wonderfully Imaginative.,This is the world that we dream of as children. The characters are wildly imaginative and keep you entertained from beginning to end. A definite on the must read list.
1,"book about children, not for children","I read this book when I was young and was disturbed by it. It is not a kid's book. It is a book by an adult ABOUT children, not FOR children.This book paints a very negative picture of children. With the exception of the main character, all of the children are bad and are punished in cruel ways for their faults. Are most children fundementally bad and deserving terrible punishment, at the moment they least expect it? This book suggests it (especially to a child who might be reading it and cannot understand what ""social commentary"" is yet). This book fits right in with the Omen and Rosemary's Baby. It is a child-exploitation story.I recommend this book to adults who do not like children."
4,Turning point,"Episodes 5-7, 2nd disc of 4As the story of Kikaider is a love story (in this version, anyway), this volume is the turning point. The previous volume left Jiro ashamed of his Kikaider form, and he runs from Mitsuko. In this volume, Jiro discovers that Mitsuko gives him a reason to live. Mitsuko decides falling in love with a robot isn't completely absurd."
1,Overcoming shyness? I think not.,This book does not teach any lessons whatsoever on overcoming shyness.
4,Planes,"As an aerospace engineer I bought this book for my 2-year old twin granddaughters, who hear every plane passing overhead. I was hoping it would be more general towards planes, but it seems mostly geared towards airline travel. Not a bad thing.... but not what I was looking for."
5,18 mo. old son loves the Byron Barton books on machines,Our 18 month old son loves these Byron Barton books about various sorts of machines - I must have read this book 100 times by now. They're just the right blend of simple and to the point for children his age.
3,"AVERAGE, PLEASANT READ","AT YOUR COMMAND isn't your normal jinni in a bottle story. Tom, our jinn, is doing his best to be released from his five thousand-year curse of servitude and torture. To do this he must trick his new master, Maggie, into setting him free. A couple of problems occur with his plan, one; she doesn't believe he's real and is being somewhat flighty with her three wishes and two; he is falling in love with her.This is a fairly short story, really a novella more so than a novel, a quick read and I found to be a rather fun one. It's a nice average story that will help you kill a little time that will give you a chuckle and a bit of a 'Ahh' at the end. I definitely RECOMMEND it, a great one for a day at the pool this summer."
2,Its no Stripes,You could tell that Delta Farce tries to be a modern day Stripes. Unfortunately it fails miserably. The story is weak and the jokes are nearly no existent. I would not recommend it.
1,Delta Farce,"Boring, boring. The best scenes were the ones that they show as a preview. Also, I could not stand the skinny guy. Just not funny."
2,A quatrain missing!!!,Where the heck is Century 2 - Quatrain 51 ?! The one that predicts the London fire of '66?!A big f.u to Nostradamus... he nailed one and they don't even include it!
3,Needs Room for Improvement,"This book is good to have for a reference. The problem is it is written in two launages - I believe Latin and then in English - It is difficult to understand. It dosent seem to say exactly what Nostradamus predicited. I guess I'm looking for something more easier. Such as - NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTED THIS.....THIS DID HAPPEN ON.....SO NOSTRADAMUS WAS ONLY 2 YEARS OFF or whatever! That would be nice. Also, the book sends you to different ""quatrains"". That is hard to do with a book thats hard to understand. I recommend Nostradamus 2003-2025: A History of the Future by Peter Lorie over this book. Except it tells from 2003-2025, not 1600-2025."
1,"Get this one, instead, if you can deal with the tedium of completeness!","Nostradamus and His Prophecies ( Edgar Leoni )ANY offering of Nostradamus' prophecies, that doesn't include the original middle-French, is bogus:you CANNOT know how accurate the translation is, then!The version I had had a slightly different cover, and had both languages,and from my minimal knowing of French ( & ability to do research ),I could see clearly that there were some incredibly ""optimistic"" or phony translations...That is the problem with having a ""believer"" do translation:instead of translation, it becomes propaganda!Get the Leoni book, instead, and enjoy the tedium of a skeptic giving you nearly everything,bad & good, contradictory or not, & then you can get some correct knowing!( no I don't consider skepticism to be something valid when it turns into a religion,and yes Leoni to some extent embodies that,but relying on ""believers"" to tell one what is what is far worse! )Cheers!"
3,A little narrow.,I take a 11 D or a normal with shoe so that is what I ordered. If you have a normal to wide foot make sure you get the 2E at least. These shoes aren't as good as the Rockports have had in the past.
4,Great Short Stories,I watched the DVD with a group of 6 people and we all enjoyed the short stories. I recommend this DVD.
3,so so...,"I picked up the book attracted by the bestseller and interesting plot, it does has a pretty good start but I was a bit disappointed on how predictable the story has evolved. Thus I think it's average read."
1,Not worth time or money,"I read Mary Jo Putney's novels during my Regency period 20 or so years ago. I'm now into fantasy and noticed this title. This was really a disappointment. I almost stopped reading halfway through it was so bad, but I wanted to know in how she wrapped it up. I didn't read the first book in the series since the reviews were not as good as this one. I certainly won't now.The problem seems to be that Ms. Putney is just doing it for the money and not from a writer's perspective of weaving story lines and characters together. The plot lines seemed contrived and just thrown in. I laughed out loud (not in a good way) at the unicorn and virgin. There were also discrepancies. Her heroine was strong and learning new skills until each time she ran into the bad guy when she seemed to regress. It wasn't very logical.The author would also throw in random bits of history as if to make the book more worthwhile. It didn't work."
3,Ok,"I ordered this school for nursing uniform. I love adidas products. This shoe however was bulky. I also was soft and comfy, but just too bulky looking for me."
2,I Hunt for Horror...,"...but found nothing of particular interest here. It was par for the MOH course. So if you've seen any of the episodes then you know what to expect. I don't know why this was""banned"". Not even the torture was significant. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I had to see it considering all of the mixed reviews it got. I didn't find it comical, not even the hand. It wasn't creepy, and I really wanted to understand the story as it was told; but like most japanese horror the third act failed to deliver only because, in typical fashion, defeating the oni isn't the point . That's all part of the experience. So what if it wasn't the greatest story ever told, it was a ride worth taking just for the girl's disturbed smile at the end. It's truly fascinating to see how other cultures handle horror. The difference, I find, is significant and always fun."
4,Miike Doing What He Does Best,"Imprint is clearly one of the highlights of season 1 of the Masters of Horror series. Extreme Japanese director Takashi Miike unleashes his penchant for brutality and surprising beauty here in a twisted tale of forbidden love and sadistic desires. Any fan of Takashi's previous work should relish this well written and shot entry into the series. The only downfall i feel is the casting of Billy Drago whom whilst good in supporting roles is simply not convincing enough to pull off the lead. This aside, Imprint is a worthy addition to the horror genre and a good introduction to Miike's work for western audiences whom are unfamiliar with the extremists previous outings. Be warned though, this is horror undiluted, sadistic and different to most cinemaplex style offerings and is precisely why his work has attracted attention from people as famous as director Eli Roth (whom gave Miike a cameo in his film Hostel). Recommended for those who like their horror shaken, not stirred."
2,Misread the title.,"This is not due to Seller, I just don't like the book. I am not a transcriptionist."
1,Product a failure,"This product looks great but failed to perform its primary function-to contain our animal. The zipper on the front flap does not stand up to the pressure applied by a determined amnimal. My dog is a 24 lb. terrier. For me, thrown out money!"
4,Fantastic Imagination,"First of all, the book does appear sexist by today's standards. However, if you're big enough to get by that you will find an absolutely fascinating science fiction story that is elegant in both its creativity and its simplicity. But be warned: this book is thought provoking and not for people that simply want to be entertained."
1,Flat -- what?,"I have to read this book for my English 4 AP class, and am so far highly disappointed and confused! What is the purpose of this book. It's another Alice in the Wonderland yet much more confusing!"
5,This book was insane.,"When I read this book in geometry class, i never knew that someone would wast so much time to write a book like this. Is this guy nuts? This man just rammbled on. He wrote about thirty pages of story, and about fifty pages of pure junk. When the author is trying to make a point he starts to trail off and starts to talk about things that have nothing to do with what the book's about. I thought I was going to go crazy, until i got to part two of the book. Part two is the actual story of the book. It was interesting about how other worlds in the book were. I like the way he described them. I also like how he took the way these people acted in the different lands and showed how close-minded some people are to new ideas. I also liked how he put in the color revolt. It was my favorite part of the book. In conclusion, I honestly wish i had never read this book. I'm glad it was only 82 pages long."
3,No Illustrations,"I think Flatland is great. I own a physical copy of it.This version lacks the illustrations. It does not claim to have them, but it should also disclose that they are lacking.If you have read and understand the book, this is fine for a reread. If not, you may find it helpful to have the illustrations. I definitely cannot argue with the price."
5,Exploration,Behind the 19th century english text is mind-boggling exploration through life on various dimensional planes from the perspective of a square that ultimately is liberated from his two- dimensional realm.
3,Free SF Reader,"Flat is an exercise in science fiction geometry, if you like. It shows a denizen of a 2 dimensional world seeing what it would be like to exist in higher dimensions. An interesting mathematical and philosophical exercise. Some will definitely find this very odd, and rather quirky. If you don't know what a dimension means in this sense, give it a miss."
1,Horrible formatting,"Don't buy this version, there are plenty of others, including free downloads. The formatting of this book is broken such that there's a forced line break every other line, making the text annoying to read. Get one of the others that is properly formatted and don't waste your money on this one."
3,No figures for Kindle Edition,"The Kindle Edition does not include figures - the comment from Amazon support on this was:""Occasionally, conversion to digital requires modification of content, layout, or format, including the omission of some images and tables."""
1,not illustrated,Word to the wise: spring for the deluxe edition for only 99 cents! Illustrations from this edition did not show up on my kindle 3.
4,A Valuable Idea for Science and Math Teachers,"Abbott, the author, has the reader imagine three-dimensional structures from a distant horizontal perspective. The third dimension becomes unimportant, and can be dispensed with completely. Taking this further, we are left with a ""society"" of circles, triangles, and other 2-D geometric figures, all living in Flatland.As a science and math teacher, I found this book an inspiration for thought-provoking questions, such as: How would you describe the sphere to someone living in Lineland or Flatland? How, for that matter, would you communicate the very concept of thickness to someone living in Flatland? Or volume?Visualize a sphere crossing Flatland. It starts as a point, then a circle of expanding diameter, then a circle of decreasing diameter, then a point, and then finally nothing. Other 3-D figures can be visualized in comparable manner. The possibilities are endless!"
5,A Classic,"This book was slow at times, but I still enjoyed it. Edwin Abbott clearly put a lot of thought into how a two dimensional society would work, and thus Flatland felt like a real place and (ironically) hardly felt flat at all. My favorite part of the book, however, had to be when Mr. Square and Mr. Sphere visit Pointland, a plane of existence consisting of zero dimensions. The self proclaimed God of Pointland talks to himself in an endless soliloquy of purple prose, and believes itself the end all and be all of everything despite not even understanding the concept of the number 2. Overall, while the book is dense and is not a light read, it was still quite enjoyable, and will leave your head buzzing with thoughts of four dimensional cubes for days."
2,When a good idea goes bad...,"Flatlandwas one of my finds on my recent short-novels hunt. I was intrigued by the premise - a comparative story of different lands, each of which features a different number of dimensions - and by the fact that its author had written the book in the 1800s, long before Einstein's theory of relativity and theories of time as the fourth dimension were common parlance. It was written by a non-mathematician and non-scientist. And it was only 75 pages long! I figured I had all the ingredients for a great, interesting, informative - and above all else, quick - read. Not so, she said. It took me forever to finish this extraordinarily short book, and it was a huge disappointment. It was rambling, overly technical (I do grudgingly have respect for this aspect, even if I did not enjoy the book overall), and (no pun intended) oddly flat."
5,Fits my 4.2 v8 Jaguar,Easy standard installation. Grooves along top make it easy to turn 3/4 turn after base contact for correct tightness. Been on there 5000 miles or so and no leaks.Almost ready for a new one.
5,Great movie series!,Great Movie series. Bought all the different ones I could find. My 5 year old loves to play them on her portable DVD player with headset. :)
3,Not bad....,"I was a little disapointed with this movie, I thought it was going to be better, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't great, a little slow, but the kids thought it was ok.They are 3 and 5 years old. Shouldn't complain really for the price."
2,SCI-FI,AN WELL MADE FILM WITH HOPES FOR THE FUTURE. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COVER...IT IS NOT A COLORIZED COPY OF THE FILM.
2,DATED!,"This film is just overall dated. Although I respect the foretelling of actual events that did take place in history, the movie itself is just not up to standards anymore and I cannot relate to it, sorry."
3,Love Liberty...blah blah blah,"I got what I expected from this cd. I really don't see how you can say that they have matured, when they have a new lead singer. Personally I love the Newsboys, but not this Cd. The stars are for ""Beautiful Sound"" and just because they're the Newsboys and they deserve them. I'm not concerned with ""profound lyrics."" I just like to listen. If have never bought a Newsboys Cd, I recommed ""Take Me to Your Leader."" ""Going Public"" is good. Thier second latest ""Step Up to the Microphone"" has some addictive songs as well."
4,Great Inspirational Music,"I believe this is by far the best Christian music that I have heard for many years. I love the group's harmony. It reminds me of the good times as a little girl when my mom would take me to church and the choir would sing so beautifully, just like The Cathredals. I love to play this CD and feel so close to Jesus when I hear these beautiful songs.t"
5,A great joyous celebration,"'The haven of rest' Glen Payne/Guy Penrod - this song makes me shiver, they have such great voices with such depth. It makes me glad that I am ""saved evermore"". Glen shows the strength of his faith as he sings 'We shall see Jesus', it slowly builds to a great finish with the rest of the groups powerful voices. 'Sinner saved by grace' George's deep deep voice start and finishe this wonderful song, and each sing a verse, the harmonising is just brilliant!. I wasn't interesed in Gospel music until recently when I saw Gaither music on Sky TV- now I am completely hooked! I have just ordered my 7th CD and first video. Roger Bennett is So amazing on the piano. There are so many great songs I could go on, but I'll just say the whole CD is well worth it's cost, it will surely encourage you to a stronger faith in Christ. They all deserve a Blessing!"
1,Disatified,"I'm a long time listener of the Cathedrals so I ordered this cd I played it no more than three times and it started skipping.I cleaned it ,tried it in two other players and it did the same thing .So buyers beware.The cd wasThe Cathedrals ""A Farewell Celebeation"". The other two cd's I purchased were ok,""Ernie Haase&Signature Sound,A Tribute to The Cathedral Quartet""and ""Cathedrals Anthology."""
2,Missing features,"I upgraded from 2.x to 4.x and I've found that although 4.x adds some additional features, it is missing a way to batch convert my images. I contacted Olympus on this and they had no clue about anything. I'm disappointed but what are you gonna do?"
1,Worst digital thermometer I ever used!,"The temperature settings for the alarm are preset and cannot be manually changed. So if you cook your food using the alarm, you can over cook it, horribly over cook it, or turn it into a cinder."
3,Needs a stronger magnet on back,"Seems to work fine. Haven't tried two probes at once. Magnet came off the back when it was stuck to the side of the microwave. Super glued it on, but it slides down the metal surface. Weight is too great for the magnet."
2,Not if you grill,"Received this item and returned it after reading the instructions. Can not be used on the grill, which is what I wanted it for."
1,Can't take the heat,"I use probe thermometers typically when cooking a roast or bird like a turkey. My method is to cook them at high heat at first then roast slowly. Unfortunately this thermometer can't take higher temps and never worked out of the gate. My old Williams Sonoma probe just went after about 8 years of faithful use. I carefully read reviews and went with this model but it was a dud for me. Maybe if you don't use high heat ever it might be okay but I can't envision that, it just is a better method that results in a better meal."
1,Sorry I bought ir,"Consumer Reports rated this model as the best, so I bought one last year to use with my Weber Smoker. After one or two times using it, it stopped working. Both probes read on LL or HH. If I would twist and hold the wire, I would sometimes get a reading, but this was rare. I previously owned a Maveric for several years, and it was great."
2,"Good in theory, Bad probes","The concept of this product is good. Nice display, and timer. Different modes for cooking, and has the temperature levels for different foods pre programmed.However, both of my probes failed after very little use. They are not well designed, and cannot take the normal wear and tear of the kitchen."
5,NEW GUITAR OF THE MILLENIUM!!!,"With so much music, and so many guitarists, one would think that it all has been done before. That's not the case with this CD. Even though I own alot of Gipsy Kings, and Ottmar Liebert CD's they seem to get tiring after a while. It's time to move on to the power of Millenium Flamenco! The entire CD is upbeat and gets you moving but also hypnotizes you with the slow song ""Spanish Village"". It's simply perfect and I don't think that there is anything else I'd rather listen to right now."
5,La musica viva!,"This cd is awesome! I have met David and he is the sweetest guy ever, not to mention extremely talented. I recommend his cd to everyone and if you get a chance, go see him live! You will not regret it - you will love it!"
5,Sucks you In,"I love HP Lovecraft, and this novella is no exception. Its thoughtful and creative and i could not put it down for anything. i loved it."
5,Excellent Case for Blackberry Pearls,"I recently bought this case for my mother, and she loves it. It saves her battery life, as well as locks her keys, preventing accidently dialing. Before, she would keep her phone in her pocket or purse, and she would have outgoing calls to a number of people from just buttons getting pushed when the phone moved. This case put a stop to that. The case is very attractive, as well, and goes with whatever you're wearing. The leather is soft, but it still keeps your phone safe. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone with a Pearl."
5,Diving Science,Be ready for that dive emergency that nobody sees coming. Belive me when I say it's coming sooner than you think.
2,disapointing...,"I LOVE Julie Garwood's books but this one was just not up to her standards at all. The beginning was cute but the more into the plot I got, the more bored I became. Ususally I hate to put her books down but this was a stuggle to get through. Jade was a contradiction in character and Caine was bossy and controlling. The only book left by her I haven't read is The Gift and now, I'm not so sure I want to read it."
1,"sorry, this thing is no good.","Ok so it doesn't copy old vhs movies because of copyright issues. I was expecting that. but after 6 tries, I finally got an old vhs of some tv shows to record onto DVD-R disks. The manual is overwhelming and does a rotten job of walking you through a sample recording. So I finally figured out that I needed to Finalize the DVD, but guess what? the DVD was only usable (fully) on the sony unit. It would play on my laptop, but no chapters, I had 360 as one big chapter, plus the time index was only up to the 24 minutes. so chapter 18, at the 24 minute mark, was for minutes 24-360. Apparently the timer thing is busted on the sony recorder as well. because I had same 24 minute marker as the last chapter on it as well.The dvd wouldn't even play at all on a regular, DVD player hooked up to my TV.I want my weekend of frustration back."
2,Locks Up,SONY - DVD RECORDER/VCR : RDR-VX525 ( Home Electronics - DVD Players )This product when playing DVD's freezes up a lot and will not let you eject the DVD. I have had to turn off the power and manually turn the white tray gear to get the DVD out. Also while trying to get the tray to eject I somehow deprogrammed the remote! It is a very temperamental machine. I have since upgraded to the Sony RDR-VX535 for my entertainment center and hope to have better results. The VX525 has been banished to my home office. Normally I have had great confidence in Sony products. This one has let me down.
1,Copy protection buit-in... hence worthless,"What's the point of having a DVD recorder when you can't even backup your own VHS copies onto DVD? The built-in copyguard is a real pain, to the point it even prevents you from backing stuff up on your own TiVo! Sony should be ashamed. First CD's, then DVD's, and now the recorder. Pay the few dollars more for a real unit such as Panasonic and call it a day."
1,"Junk, would not play back the DVD's on other recorders",This is an unrealiable product. I spent many hours copying old family VHS to DVD and I am now finding that these DVD's don't play on other recorders. They freeze up. I even put it in a sony DVD player and it locks up. What a bunch of junk. I also coppied DVD footage from my Digital 8 camera to dvd and that didn't work either. Would never recommend this. Big waste of money and time!
2,Good For Very Narrow Foot!,I received these shoes yesterday. They were packaged very well. The shoe look very nice. When I went to put it on it was very painful! I usually have no problems with a 7M. This sandal was made for a narrow foot. I am returning the product. Very cute sandal otherwise!!!
5,Life After Life,Best book for an easy-to-read factual explanation of the transition from life to death. I give a copy to anyone who loses a loved one.
4,Thought provoking,This book speaking to the topic of life after death is very thought provoking. The author cites numberous examples of near death experiences that share much in common with one another giving credibility to the incidents. Each of us must come to grits with our own death and what we are to expect. This book helps in that personal quest.
5,SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF AN AFTERLIFE,"This classic book was the first published to scientifically support the Christian belief in an afterlife. Now there is an entire genre labeled ""near death experiences."" Outstanding and a great boost to Christian Biblical faith."
1,Roxio messed up wtih this,"First of all, it does not work. I wanted to burn VCD on my CD-R, it won't. Went to find support about why it won't, there isn't any support. Went to the customer's forum and found out the product has been bad, and not supported for 2 years. Save your time, find something that functions. I'm back in the search for a ""WORKING"" VCD creator."
3,"Not that bad, not that good, quite workable program","I bought this program to run with a dedicated computer to make dvd's for my dog training business.Plus side, easy to install on my new sony computer,rarely freezes, transfererred files from canon dv camcorder.story line editor is fairly easy to use,.down side, the text editor really sucks, if you need to add text to dvd section like i do, then this program really shortchanges you. The directions that come with it are a bit limited and require imagination to apply.cannot add pics, which is a drag,This program builds basic, simple dvd with chapters, once you figure out that a ""chapter"" is a movie.Progrm files and video are drive hogs, filled the c drive in two days of shooting.People like me are really pushing this tech to the edge, it it not quite there.Good basic, fairly intuitive program,am considering pinnacle next.(ps bought a 5$ copy of the free roxio easy dvd on ebay, just to see if it would load, it did.)"
1,Not The Original Recordings,"Wow was I disappointed when I realized these were not the original recordings! Like the other reviewers, I should have read the reviews. Don't get this if you are looking for the original recordings you heard on the radio."
3,"Great Art, Same Old Story","This is the second season of the Ghost In The Shell series and like the first one, 2nd Gig is very pretty and the voices are perfect for the characters. The problem I have with it is the fact that the story makes no sense and it has a very anti-American twist. Most of the major plot points are left out and that leaves you barely enough information to understand what the story is all about. I won't give too much away in case you haven't seen it yet but in this version of the future all Goverments are evil and corrupt (with America being some sort of shadow empire), there was a war some where but they never say where and the people who left that country are now flooding Japan (as if they have enough room for that) and this causes huge problems which leads to other problems. See what I mean, it makes no sense because too much is left out. Watch the first season, it's so much better."
5,great,"Great tool bag. Plenty of room for everything and then some. Very sturdy, a ton of pockets for anything you may need."
2,so Desperate it Hurts,"I remember Grooving too Carlos Santana before He became A ""IN"" Thing.when You Hear a Album like this you are left feeling kinda Empty.while Carlos Still has a Great Tone on Guitar it's also coming with a Hefty Price.""SuperNatural"" is Easily one of the Most Overrated Albums I've Ever Heard&all those Awards were Pay Back for a Man that had for too long been ignored.but Making Him into a Quincy Jones type of Artist doesn't do Him any Justice.Clive Davis Sold this Project Before but in 3 Short Years the Formula Wore Off.I'll Take Santana Live at Fillmore with Billy Graham as the Spin Doctor before anymore of the Clive Davis,LA Reid Pimping that is making Carlos Santana seem as a Bit Player on His Own Album.what happen too the COlabs with Michael Jackson,Prince&Quincy Jones???Heck His Playing&Vibe with Michael Jackson on the Song""WhatEver Happens"" From ""Invincible"" Has More Feeling than this Whole Album Combined."
1,Santana: Se te extraña en el pasado.,"Santana fue, uno de los mas grandes guitarristas que pudo dar aqui mexico, desde Autlan, jalisco. Emigrado a Estados Unidos, creo su primer disco Homonimo y saco ms discos maravillosos como: ""Abraxas"" y ""Caranaverasai"". Despues de casi dos decadas, a finales de los 90, decide sacar otros discos.Pero, seguramente, como por falta de dinero o fama(Cosa que ya no le hacia falta el talento)Decidio triztemente irse hacia el pop. Y esto es lo que tenemos: Un disco que quiere pasar por ser cool(Lo que se salva es la compañias en el disco de Dido y Seal) con super-grandes invitados, y con el gran hit, llamado ""game of love"" Dizque muy romanticona...Si se convierte asi, pronto hara dueto con Luis Miguel O la Britney.¿Que paso Santana nuestro? ¿Ya no te acuerdas de tus hermanos del Woodstock?¿Te olvidastes de ""Smba pa, ti"" y ""Black magic woman""? Hay una razon: El mundo del pop, te ha invadido. Salvate..."
2,"""Game of Love"" is the lamest Santana solo ever!","OK. So you can downgrade my review b/c I haven't actually heard the whole CD, just the radio play of ""Game of Love."" I was trying hard to figure out who this guitar player was when I heard the song on the local Adult Contemporary station (I'm forced to listen to it on the vanpool). I was thinking, ""Who is this self-important guitarist?""There's just this vibe on the song that the guitar is really important; I mean, how many pop songs have BIG guitar solos in them anymore? Not since the Eagles. :) Anyway, the guitar is featured in a big way, and Carlos totally blows it with this cheesy, uncreative, pentatonic nightmare. I guess you could call it Sanny G. He's capable of such soul, but doesn't show it here. It's painful to listen to."
1,waste,"This is not a Santana recording. Carlos Santana plays back-up to some mediocre singers on some dreadful songs. only the few tracks that don't have any guests are worth listrning to.Particularly offensive are: Michelle Branch and her Brittany Spears impression, Musiq 's bad Michael Jackson impression on a truely horrible song (""I'm a victem of my time"" indeed, more like a victem of no talent), and Placido Domingo (?!).Carlos' playing is great but it is wasted on very poor material, ideas and ""guests""."
1,how could he do this to himself?,"I thought Supernatural was genius; let a legend show this generation how music SHOULD sound. Brilliant. not a song I couldn't listen to over and over again.Shaman is a waste. of time. of his gift. of money.Amore(Sexo) is frankly horrid, and except for America w/ P.O.D. and Game of Love(though he could have picked a better singer)i can't listen to more than 30 seconds of any song on this c.d.If you want to hear him at his best, watch Santana's perforamnce at the original Woodstock. To hear him waste his talent, buy this c.d."
2,"It's a letdown, sad to say","To tell you the the truth I'm kinda disappointed with this one. After the blatantly commercial (but strong) Supernatural we get this sequel. I heard ""Game of love"" on the radio and asked myself is this the same guy who did ""Black magic women""?. Most of The guest spots gave me a ""Been there, done that"" feeling and don't compliment Santana well, he has so much more potential. This album can't hold a candle to his earlier stuff. I'd recommend Abraxas to anyone curious for a different (and definitely better) side of Santana"
3,Nothing Healing about this!,"What happened here? Supernatural was amazing. This record is like the drivel they threw away when looking for perfection way back in 1999. There are a few gems here, but too few to mention. I love santana but this isn't what this disc was meant to be i dont think. Better luck next time"
4,judge for yourself,"Music is highly personal and you probably shouldnt be swayed by either the pros or cons. I think there is something for everyone. Personally ,I love the Michelle Branch and POD songs.Who can say why some songs reach you and others don't. If you're looking for some mozart beethoven genious compositions or some other musical snobbery you might not find it here. If you want some nice catchy music with variety and good guitar playing this could be one you should buy"
3,Why Don't You and I?,"The version of the song with Alex Band from The Calling recently came out as a single and you can buy it here on Amazon. I think it's a better version. While Chad Kroeger is great, Band's voice is more suited to the song."
1,Carlos ain't MY Shaman NO-Moe,"Oh well; it was good while it lasted. Guess this will be the LAST Santana disk I buy. Supernatural was a real stretch (some of the songs I STILL can't listen too) I haven't found ANY on Shaman I want to llisten too again. Carlos has strayed so far from the style of music that made me LOVE him in the 60's, to a style I refuse to listen to now. Don't know how other long-time fans feel, but I am Dissappointed! I guess if I was stranded with only one disk to listen too, it would still be Abraxas. If it had to be Shaman,or Supernatural, I had rather just do without.Anybody wanna' free disk or two??Your............Oldhipy"
1,AVOID BUYING CELL PHONES ON AMAZON!,"I gave this a 1 since I couldn't give a 0 rating. First of all this phone is ""ok."" But beware that Amazon can say one thing and the cell phone carrier(cingular in my case) can say something else. When I bought the phone I added the MEdia Basic with Unlimited Mobile to Mobile (400 Messages: Text, Picture & IM, 1MB MEdia Net Access)First month unlimited! Cingular's Media packages bundle some of Cingular's most popular data services into a single offering. MEdia Basic package includes: unlimited Mobile to Mobile, 400 Messages (Text, Video and Instant Messaging) overage is $0.10 per message; 1 MB MEdia Net, overage is $0.01 per KB. Amazon is saying that FIRST MONTH IS UNLIMITED but Cingular told me that they can't do that. So now I have a 700 dollar phone bill. Thanks a lot Amazon."
4,Daughter enjoys this,"I got this for my daughter when she was nearly 3 ... after she fell in love with the Christmas Eloise movie from this same cast & producer. She enjoys this--particularly watching how two children learn how to get to know each other. I like this production--love Tim Curry and Lynn Redgrave, and I think Mary Matilyn Mouser, who does Eloise's voice, does a great job."
4,THE WHITE MOST BLACK OF ITALY,"Mario Rosini isn't only an excellent singer!He is a complete musician of big talent!!Michael McDonald was defined the white most black of America.Well then, of Mario Rosini it's possible to say the same thing for Italy.In the way of music doing of Mario, there's a mix of jazz, funky, blues, gospel and high-level pop to the point that establishing the border between each of these musical kinds is really difficult.Certainly, this compact disc doesn't give back justice to his talent, but the market also wants this!Stevie Wonder, George Benson, are alone some of the inspiring models of Mario Rosini, who moreover owns an unique and unmistakable artistic identity.Goes listened!Heartily advised to all Italians residents in the States!!"
3,Head in jar,It was as represented in add and picture. Will work to display it in our haunted garage for halloween night. Was sent promptly.
4,great value,For what I paid this watch is worth the money. I am someone who dislikes watches to begin with and some watches I have looked at are some what bulky. Not this one I like how light it is and the features of the time zones is great when I travel.
4,Another brilliant book,"This book is well worth reading if you are a fan of Agatha Christies, Hercule Poirot. Poirots first taste of a traditional English Christmas ends in him solving the disappearance of a Princes ruby. After recieving a sinister note warning him not to eat the Christmas Pudding, a mysterious visitor in the night and his host nearly choking on the Christmas Pudding he sets a trap for his suspect and a joke on the children of the household. Not only in this story does Poirot retrieve a stolen ruby but he also helps his hosts to rid themselves of a problem of their own. This is a brilliant book and well worth the read."
3,Surprised By This Being a Collection of Short Stories,"This book came to my Kindle with no problems. The reason for only three stars is the mere fact that I was expecting a complete book, not short stories. I suppose it is my fault for not evaluating my purchase in-depthly enough. However, I did enjoy reading the stories. And they suit a person well who is not wanting to get involved with a book but still wants to read a good mystery."
4,A Dictionary of Homonyms,"I give this book 4 stars only because it was printed in 1979 and needs to be updated. Otherwise I found it very helpful for my research in writing my own 'Fownetik Dikshaaree'. (speech speling). The format of this book is very easy to follow, but I found somewhat lacking in that some Homonyms are not listed. An update would bring this book to 5 stars I'm sure. I have tried to contact the Author, Louise Ellyson, with no success. Maybe she could contact me. Marty Shestek bytryder@aol.com. I would like to discuss my book with you. It would be helpful to me. Thank you"
1,An unwise purchase.,"I should have listened to other reviewers, this humidifier is so loud...and I live in Manhattan, and I thought it would never disturb me. But it disturbed the cat, the entire Upper East Side and me.I didn't incur any less dry heat induced nosebleeds and wasn't always sure when the thing was working.It was returned today."
2,dont read,This book is filled with uninteresting characters. The main character is a loser who and the reader has a hard time feeling for him. The dialogue is weak and the book is very shallow. It reminds me of a made for cable movie - not even good enough to be a broadcast. The ending is utterly disappointing because you know the main character is already such a dork. The book does read fast but is disappointing the entire way leaving you unsatisfied.
2,Had alot of promise...,"I'm a big fan of the neo noir genre and after enjoying ""The Follower"", was looking forward to reading this.My issue with this novel was the ending. This book was well written and fast paced (hence the 2 stars) but it lead nowhere. I felt like the author couldn't figure out an ending himself and so just left it as it was. It seemed like it was building up and up to a big bang and then it just fizzled away to nothing. I've read novels before with ambigous endings (King, Ellis) but it did not work here at all. I felt ripped off.If you want some terrific neo noir, I suggest you check out theKiss Me, Judastrilogy by William Christopher Baer."
4,"Dark, twisted noir","A simple turn of events -- a guy gets his wallet stolen in a bar -- leads David Miller on a hellride through the darker side of Manhattan that finds him dealing with a maniacal girlfriend, a crack-addicted hooker and the hooker's dead boyfriend. Jason Starr is the modern equivalent of Jim Thompson or Charles Willeford, a master of dark, twisted noir. This one isn't as good as his last, but it's still darn good."
5,Beatiful,Same as previously: one never tires to watch it. Like all other Pepper Pig stories this is professionally and superbly produced
3,Didn't work in our DVD player,"My daughter loves peppa pig, unfortunately the DVD didn't work in our DVD player and we had to play it in our computer. Very disappointing."
3,Peppa Pig,"My daughter LOVES this cartoon. She starts laughing and clapping her hands when Peppa talks. The DVD is great, but the voices are different than the ones that air on TV, so she lost interest pretty quickly."
3,Boring,"I am obviously not a fan of Julie Garwood, since the only novel of hers I've liked so far is Castles. I didn't even manage to finish ""The Bride"" and had hard time finishing this. I really hated The Bride, but Saving Grace was not a bad book; it just failed to grab my interest. All three books of hers I've read so far have the same type of heroine: weak and naive bordering on stupidity. My main objection about Mrs Garwood stories though, is the slow development. I'm generaly looking for drama or action or at least a mystery to keep the story going. This happily living together for days or weeks, nothing changing in the premises but the couple's growing affection while all is well, is making me tired and bored. But then a lot of people probably like that stuff since Mrs Garwood is one of the most loved writers of historical romance. So no more Garwoods for me from now on, even if Castles was great."
3,simiar to another book by Julie Garwood,"I thought the book was very good but it was alot like ""The Bride"" another book by Julie Garwood. The plots are very similar. If you loved ""The Bride"" you'll enjoy this book."
5,Katherine,Julie Garwood is an unbelievable writer. I am in the process of reading ALL of her books and so far I love each and every one of them. Saving Grace was a very good book. Very lovable characters. I encourage everyone to read her books. I do enjoy reading the reviews to keep me on track when a book is in a series. I dislike reading a book out of order.
5,Still fresh after 14 reads...,"I have owned this book for the past 10 years. In that time, I've read it a total of 14 times and am soon to embark on my 15th reading of it. ""Saving Grace"" is sweet and funny. I never grow tired of the characters' interactions."
4,1 of her best,"A smooth writing stile that combines humor, action, historical fact, treachery, passionate love and the quite everyday moments of life makes this a wonderfully romantic and memorable story.At first Johanna was shy, but as Gabriel tenderly revealed the splendid pleasures they would share, she came to suspect that she was falling in love with her gruff new husband. And it was soon obvious to the entire highlands clan that their laird had surrended his heart completely. But could The King of England and the memory of Johanna's first husband tear them apart?"
3,Good Read,"Love Garwood's historicals.There are no surprises here. The English heroine is unbelievably beautiful, the Scottish hero is an unparalleled warrior, and they will successfully overcome a brutish villain en route to living happily ever after. (And because it's Garwood, none of it will be too ugly). But along the way, you will laugh and cry and generally have a good time."
2,Beware. Not true size.,"The filter we ordered was quite a bit larger than the size it is marked as and didn't fit. We did get it installed but it had to be manipulated and bent into place with a mallet. The location requires an 8ft ladder to install it in the ceiling, so we we're not happy customers. We couldn't find this size anywhere, so we were happy to find it through Amazon. But disappointed in the sizing which should be standard."
2,"Good filter, but the SIZE matters","These are decent filters for the money. Unfortunately (for me) they decided to make the 12x25x1 filter 11x24x1 which proved to be too small for my unit. I tried shifting it every way possible but the only position it seems to fully cover and not allow dust and debris into the coils is shoved way down. Problem is the filter then gets soaking wet from the condensation channel that runs below it. Shame this company didn't decide to go ahead and make the filter the TRUE size stated on the package. I have no use for these now. Yes, I am blaming the maker for something I knew when I ordered them, but when I really think about it, it is the actual size that should be listed on the package. Not a fictional size."
4,Good intro work,"This is a good introductory work with a useful organization scheme since it is done by areas of the body.The methods are simplified, but then it would probably be impossible to do a book on truly complex Chin Na techniques. For that you would probably need a video.Nevetheless, I am a big believer in using the simplest, most effective techniques. The way to use a book like this, is to learn the most applicable, versatile techniques, perhaps no more than a couple of dozen or so (unless Chin Na is a specialty of yours). Remember, in the 1400s even a great Jiu-Jitsu master might only know a few moves--but he could apply them to an amazing variety of situations with great speed and effectiveness.Although Chin Na is one of my specialties, I think the same thing applies to the other grappling arts, Chin Na and Aikido."
4,No one home ... but that's the point,"How does ""no one"" deal with sudden enlightenment in a society that has no context for it and looks at it as a pathological problem to be fixed?Ms. Segal tells her story well. From fear to joy, her story covers a lifetime.This is not a how to manual. It is a traveler's narrative. I found it both an enjoyable and deeply thoughtful book."
4,"Good mystery, fun read","Certainly not one of the more difficult JDC locked room mysteries. It's perfectly possible to solve how the crimes were committed... but putting your finger on the criminal may be more difficult than you realize at first. However, regardless of whether you're stumped from the get-go or whether you successfully navigated to the solution, The Case of the Constant Suicides is a fun, light read that does not overstay its welcome. Typically, I hate in-book romances. They always seem forced and hackneyed, but for whatever reason, I didn't mind the one in Suicides... maybe because JDC didn't take it seriously, made it obvious from the beginning how the relationship would end up, and made as much fun out of it as possible. Heck, just about everything in the book is incredibly fun, especially the interplay between the characters, who are, I have to say, flat as playing cards, but immensely amusing."
2,ho-hum Masterpiece Contemporary production,"I'm surprised by the number of highly positive reviews posted here - from the start, I thought the story fell flat from its potential and I only hung in for the love story subplot. I suppose if you weren't aware of all the ways data about our every electronic move are being used, it could be a shocking revelation. But it felt like old news to me, and all of the twists and turns seemed like they'd been rehashed from other productions. The ending (spoiler alert: the bad guys win in every possible way) certainly did not make up for how long and drawn out the plot was.For British drama that's chock full of conspiracies and cyber-stalking, moves fast with a lot of tension, and has intriguing characters, I'd recommend the MI-5 series instead."
5,Outstanding View of the Future,"This video is spellbinding from beginning to end as we look into our own futures. The day is not long off when we will all be carrying around ID cards and using them to get into all buildings/conveyances so the government will always know where we are....a frightening thought, but it IS coming. People have become like sheep in letting their governments get away with all they do. The youth of America and the UK are becoming conditioned to accept all of this as ""normal"". I feel sorry for them as they will never know the freedoms that we experienced as kids. They should make the viewing of this video mandatory in every school in the US and Europe. Benedict Cumberbatch is in his best role ever (even better than Holmes).Wake up people......the days of the Beatles walking barefoot across Abbey Road are gone forever."
3,won't play on cd players,This is cd/dvd set will not play on any of my 3 cd/dvd players .Plays just fine on my blue ray player and sounds fantastic.I do wish I had known about this glitch
4,A very useful book from a classroom perspective,"When I wanted to learn C language, the second book I picked up was this same series on C [the first one being K & R, which I read later to comprehend].This book on UML follows the same tradition of ""Teach a concept then give plenty of exercises to practice what you learnt"". It includes two case studies also. It also includes a chapter on Real time UML, another on OCL and another chapter on Design patterns. A very good buy for the money (16+ dollars).Pros: Excellent book for beginners Lots of exercises to practice what you learnt. This can be a first book to read before moving into heavy weights like UML series [from awl] or Booch series [from sigs]. Coverage of Object Constraint LanguageCons: May be taking a case tool like Rational Rose or TogetherJ for implementation, as a side-by-side treatment would have made this book more comprehensive.Overall I am very much satisfied with this book at a elementary level."
5,What children draw,"As the saying goes: a picture is worth a thousand words, & when working with children, especially those in distress, images are so much easier for them to portray than words or sentences.SIGNALS FROM THE CHILD is engaging & informative with masses of drawings to view. Jean Coles ably ties together what she teaches. I learnt a lot about the way children of all ages draw, what the symbols mean, & also when a drawing is simply a drawing!Rebeccasreads recommends Jean Coles' SIGNALS FROM THE CHILD as a valuable tool for anyone who works with children. Certainly for grandparents, parents, teachers, day care centers, medical clinics, religious schools, aunts & uncles, babysitters & nannies.Very well done!"
5,Beautiful!,I love Anne Geddes' work. She is divine. The babies are adorable. Each photo is precious in content.
3,Handle gets loose,"The pan works well. But the handle gets loose, and wobbles no matter how well you tighten the single screw that holds it in place."
5,10+ years and is finally starting to wear,"I bought a brand new set of Wearever pots and pans in the box from a yard sale 10 years ago as a poor college student and they have traveled all over the country with me. I've never put them in the dishwasher and I always use silicone or plastic spatulas. I almost always wash it out right away before anything gets stuck on them, I stack them inside of one another, and I would say for the $30 I initially paid, I got one heck of a good deal. I love them so much that I want to replace the ones wearing with the exact same pots and pans. I cook a lot, and have never had any problems with these pots and pans. The handles have never become wobbly. An amazing product. I hope my next set lasts me this long!"
5,Amazing once again!,"I orginally bought this book off of amazon.co.uk.com because its a british book and it came out sooner in england. I was sooooo amazed at how anthony horowitz once again, captures so much action in one book! I absolutlely LOVE this series because its so enjoyable to read and also because it never gets boring! I'm a girl and although this book would probably seem more apealing to guys, i would HIGHLY suggest this book and the rest of its series to any girl out there! If you want to read this book i would recomend reading the first two first (stormbreaker, point blank/blanc)"
5,A Friendly Source,"Of all the references I have seen so far, this is the most complete as far as covering all of Jane Austen's personal life, the last 200 years of how other famous people saw her, a clear discussion of each of her novels, and how the many adaptations have had an impact in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This book is must reading for oldtime fans of Jane and a great and full introduction for first time readers. Who can resist being a fan after reading this fine book? It deserves to be kept handy all the time."
1,It has been changed!,"Be aware... be very aware. All the electronic versions of Patricia St John's works are the revised edition. In 1999, Mary Mills revised the original text. The words have been changed and the story line has been rearranged. As someone who loved the originals in my childhood and continue to read them in my adulthood, I find the revisions distracting and significantly less poignant than the originals. READ THE ""LOOK INSIDE"" before buying and make sure that you know exactly what you're buying. And ask the publishers to produce the originals again - they're now out of print even in paperback."
3,glad I stayed with it,"The Rainbow Garden is a book about a young girl, Elaine, whose mother goes to Paris and sends her to the country with Mrs. Owen and Rev. Owen with their rambunctious kids.Elaine, a young shy girl from London, is at first very scared of these children. She finds a garden and cares for it until one day she sees as strange man. There are many predicaments Elaine gets into while she lived in the country.This was a very boring book until the half way mark. I was about to quit but it got much more interesting. This is not a good book for young readers with short attention spans."
5,Easy to install ... With the right tools,"I have a 97 Maxima and picked this hitch to use with a hitch mounted bike rack. The installation instructions were clear and easy to follow. Make sure you have a strong drill before you get started. Drilling the bumper with a cordless drill was a chore, but doable. This hitch came with the appropriate drawbar and pin; most other online sellers didn't provide them at this price point. The hitch feels strong and secure and it handles the 120 pounds of rack and bikes like a champ."
1,NO POWER,"I ordered this product because of it's on-the-go ability and size. It comes with 3 attachments including a brush. It will not even move dust and spider webs around. It certainly will not pick them up. If you hold it against your hand, there is not air. I definitely would not recommend it."
1,Electronics/computer vacuum,"Well this was probably the biggest waste of money I ever spent on a computer. There is LITERALLY NO SUCTION. It will not pick up a piece of dust, a paper flake, a piece of salt. It's THAT weak. And the option where you switch the small attachment to the air outtake part of the vacuum and use it as a blower...well that is equally weak, lame, and useless as well. Trust me, take your money and buy a few cans of compressed air. It cleans much better (well anything would clean better), and you can actually see, and feel it blowing the dirt away."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie is entirely pointless and a basic rehash of many films before it. How this won an Oscar is beyond me, but the Oscars have been going down for years as many of the actual best pictures are never even nominated, let alone win. It's truly tragic when such rubbish is held in high accolades. I would like the 2 hours of my life back spent watching this tripe."
3,Watch on DVD so you can rewind,"It's a good thing my husband and I watched this on DVD in our living room so that we could keep rewinding whenever we didn't follow something (which was often). There was a scene where Jack Nicholson walks over to two priests in a restaurant and hands them a piece of paper. We had to rewind about 5 times before we could pause at the right spot to see what was on the paper. The acting was great, but the plot was too disjointed and confusing. To add to the confusion, Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio even look alike! We're not prudes, but the constant use of the F-word was wearisome after awhile and the fact that literally none of the characters had any redeeming values was depressing. To sum up the plot: Everybody's crooked, lots of blood, lots of profanity, everybody (almost) ends up dead. The End."
3,Violence without sex,"Another DiCaprio movie directed by Scorsese. This guy has worked with everyone!!! Here he is, working with Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon to remake the amazing Hong Kong crime drama ""Infernal Affairs"", where the mob has a mole in the police and the police has a mole in the mob, played by Dicaprio and Damon. But which is which? Great action and guts, but somehow Dicaprio is sleepwalking through this one, with Damon more convincing as a seedy, sleazy recruit gone bad. Jack Nicholson is cocky, but not convincing as a crook somehow (?!?!?). The violence builds up and gets labyrinthine, as the two characters close in on each other. Great action, great guesswork, but somehow Dicaprio and Nicholson feel miscast."
4,good film,scorses does it again! this film has a very good plot very good acting and a hella good ending. maybe maybe scorses will get an oscar win but i dont think he will get it for this. but i think he at least should get a nom. but besides the point its a must see thrill ride full of twists and turns and an all star cast. a must see for scorsese fans!
2,here we go again--the kitchen sink,Marty---are you listening? Now that you got the damn award get rid of Di Caprio and drop Nicholson. Remember less is more. Read Hitchcock and Kubrick again. Return to your roots: do more original organized crime stuff (try Albanians) or think about a post post modern Taxi Driver. Knock it off with the blatant attacks on the Church. It's embarrassing for you. Do it more subtly if you really need to expiate your past. Ask Daniel Day Lewis to act in your next film. He saved Gangs from the waste basket.And oh by the way...is there any way we can just buy the last 5 minutes of this flick. The rest of it was just a rehash of Miller's Crossing...and sorry but that was done lots better.
4,I'm a Slow Leak,"I am the kind of viewer who, when looking at films with plot twists and turns and double crossings back and forth, gets very very confused. This movie is obviously great ... I've looked at it 3 times already and I still don't get it. But I can tell it's quality. Too bad I can't come back and rate it again after the 7th viewing. If you enjoy plot twists and the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to, this is it. It definitely has a lot of action."
5,Great Movie,"Saw this movie in the theater and knew I was going to buy it as soon as it came out. A must see and for most guys, a must-own!"
3,Follow the lines,"This movie is great if you have about two hours to pay close attention. Compared to Goodfellas among other ganster movies it is a modern version. The cast is full of familiar faces and interesting swirls of how the individual characters connect. At the end your jaw will be in your lap!! You will not believe this ending! It's worth buying just to have in your collection, but even more so just to see the ending!!"
4,Better than Goodfellas---for me...,"I won't bother to try and convince anyone that The Departed is the better film of the two, I just enjoyed The Departed and its pacing better than Goodfellas which I have always found to be too slow for my tastes...Otherwise....The Departed's cast is at least as strong as any film I have seen in recent years with all members taking their game to the next level and Jack not falling into too many ""Jack"" moments and remaining in character MOST of the time...Picking on ANY gangster related film as being derivative of other gangster films is like critiqueing a Western for showing horses and cowboy hats...sorry...but once you are IN a genre you are IN a genre and some similarities are bound to occur...Great use of music as usual in any Marty film...Best American film of '06?? Possibly...certainly better than any ""mainstream"" American film I have seen in the past year..."
4,Great movie but pay attention . . .,"The Departed is the kind of movie you have to pay attention to at all times. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though - you feel sort of like you have been through something after this movie ends. I suppose you could watch it and not pay as much attention - you'd probably still enjoy it.The movie is basically about rats and organized crime in Boston - There's a mob guy working inside the police and there's a undercover officer working inside the mob. So each side is working to find out just who the rat really is.The movie has an all star cast - Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin to name a few. They all play their parts exceptionally well. Mark Wahlberg's character is not only serious, but also funny, in that serious kind of way."
4,"Vastly entertaining , but hit PAUSE if you have to go to the john!","Expectations were high for this movie, and it doesn't disappoint...It keeps you riveted thruout, although it was a twinge anti-climatic for me after Jack Nicholsons character 'departed' lol. His appeal in this movie adds alot, as does the other stars fine performances. Martin Scorcese's cinematography and the rapid pace of the storytelling don't leave any moments for attention lapses. The information comes at you pretty non-stop and if your not paying attention, you might miss a crucial element to the complex story. Involved as it is, it still was very well conceived I felt. What a complicated balancing act Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters juggled! Every twist and turn to the story made the entire thing all the more compelling to watch. Everyone will decide for themselves how this Scorcese flick stacks up to his others, but comparisons notwithstanding, it was a highly entertaining and well done drama."
4,The Departed,EXCITING AND INTRIGING PLOT. WILL KEEP YOU GLUED AND ON THE EDGE. CASTING FOR THIS MOVIE WAS SUPERB DEFINITELY ONE FOR YOUR LIBRARY.
2,Not so dearly departed,This overlong and eventually boring film desperately did not deserve the Academy Award for best film - watch INFERNAL AFFAIRS instead and get a bigger impact in 90 minutes than Scorses provides in nearly 3 hours!!!!
4,Strap in your seatbelt and expect high impact...,"The Departed was a thrilling movie with excellent acting by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast. Guns, gangs, good cops/bad cops, moles, what more could you ask? The only part I didn't like was the ending. I found it to be an anticlimactic way to end the story (or in flip slang... it was CORNY Ka!)Aside from that, this is worth watching in theatre or getting the dvd."
2,Academy Award -- why?,"I just watched this movie on HBO and was extremely puzzled and disappointed. Disappointed because I could not follow the confusing plot at all. Flashbacks and generally choppy editing made it impossible to get drawn into this plot. Puzzled because I have no idea why Martin Scorsese got an Academy Award for this film, except (as popular belief holds) it was finally ""his time"" and they decided to give him one before he died. This movie made no sense and is full of pointless profanities and violence.To me, the movie mainly serves as a signal that Jack Nicholson needs to find a different part to play other than Jack Nicholson. In this movie, he just plays what he's been playing for 20 or 30 years now -- some sarcastic, bitter SOB who is totally evil. Then he collects his fat paycheck for another ""acting"" job.Avoid this movie! It's all hype and little payoff."
4,Better than Goodfellas? No.,"The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time."
1,Terrible - nothing to recommend this mess,"From such a good cast and director I expected much better than this. Its unbelievable, poor dialogue, bad acting, and way too long. The movie doesnt explain what motivates an intelligent, highly motivated character (Damon) to be drawn into being a mob insider. There was a good story here but its lost in the poor dialogue and unbelievable characters. (Also the overuse of the fword does not come across well in this movie as in say a Tarantino flick.)"
1,"Mostly awful bloody violence, not much plot","This film had the makings of a great flick: a fabulous cast, great acting, and a terrific initial setup: You have DiCaprio as a mole for the police infiltrating the Mafia, and Damon as a mole for the Mafia infiltrating the police. But there's no character development, and the plot is weak, overly complicated, confused, and lacking in resolution.Worst of all, this film is horribly violent. I walked out of the theatre feeling like I needed an exorcism and a valium. Hey, Scorsese, if you're going to assault your audience with all that gore, at least give us the payoff of character development and a well-crafted, interesting plot and conclusion."
2,disappointing,"Sean Penn is much better at being a back-water irish (take it from someone who is one) and both ""Mystic River"" and ""State of Grace"" are a better portrayal of the contradictions that are Irish Catholic Americans. Nicholson was the most disappointing, sloppily repeating his ""Joker"" character in ""Batman."" This film is also poorly crafted. There is much young talent in Hollywood in screen writing, production design, cinematography and all the other skills and talents that make a movie worth watching. Instead, what we get here is celebrity actors, celebrity directors and a tired sound track of the same old ""classic rock."" I apologize to Martin Sheen, who was the one shining star."
1,This movie is great but its a tad bit nutty,"this movie is one of scorcese's greatest motion pictures but it is not a picture i would like to frame. its like a peanut. its way to nutty. i highly recommend this movie if u like peanut butter. o by the way, wheres my precious plutonium?"
4,Intense,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you."
4,pretty good movie...,"This is a re-make of a Chinese multi part movie, although they forced everything into 1 move ( whereas the Asian original was several parts ) I thought this movie was still pretty good. With the HD the movie just looks that much better, the clarity in each scene is amazing."
1,infuriating,i was comparing the picture quality of this blu-ray dvd to the hbo hd broadcast and i was shocked to find that the dvd is not in true cinemascope as advertised...but a regular full screen ratio CROPPED AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN to give it the APPEARANCE of cinemascope. so not only is it lacking the width of the original in theater version...but cropping off the top and bottom of the picture. what a rip off! i intend to return this product.
1,The Departed - Deadly,"It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Scorcese finally got Best Director for what he himself said was... 'the first movie I've made with a plot.'Save your money... unless you think you might enjoy 152 minutes of racial hatred between the Italians and Irish, vulgar language, and murders that make The Godfather and The Sopranos play like children's bedtime stories. In which case, you might want to pay Amazon $15.99 for the DVD so you can watch it over again. I think, however, that you will probably decide to resell it to get your money back."
2,UGH,Well...let me first say....I am a fan of every actor in the movie. I watched this for the fist time last night (dvd screener for the Oscars) I am glad I didnt have to buy it. It is just awful. I hate to say that...I really do. I thought it would ROCK! Geee it was all I could do to sit through it. Sorry to all in the cast...but if I had paid to see it - I would have demanded my money back. I only gave it two stars (instead of 1) because I truly LOVE all the major actors in it (in their past movies) --- crazy disappointed.
4,SCORSESE COASTING,"THE DEPARTED is Scorsese at his most professional and entertaining but it feels like he could have directed it in his sleep, by which I mean all the elements of the script and charactes are clever, and the involvement of the government on a high level a new twist, but he's done it all before, and better in GOODFELLAS and the underrated CASINO."
3,A Question...,"Will somebody please tell me what all the fuss is about?Yes, Marty was due for a ton of things he should have won for in the past. Yes, DiCaprio gives a damn fine performance here. But BEST picture?Surely not.This is a film that is nicely done. It is well made. Outside of Marky-Mark, who is way over the top in his role, there's not really a weak link in the cast (though Nicholsen once again pretty much plays himself). I just don't see what sets this one apart.I'm kind of glad I don't have a vote for best picture. This year was thin on good movies, much less great ones. The Departed is a B, maybe a B+ movie at best. Great?Nope.Which brings me to what is probably my biggest critique of the film: you better have a Hamlet on your hands if your gonna be littering the stage with bodies at the end. There is no prince of Denmark here--just a bunch of blood and bagpipes."
1,not a Catholic film for children,"I was told this was about Irish Catholics in Boston and so I thought it would an ideal program to show the family on Sunday morning. WELL!!! I was very surprised to find a great deal of profanity and violence in a film billed as a Catholic film for children. Poor little Daphne was horrified by all the blood and has refused to come out of her room for the last week. She sobs and sobs and can't believe that the same man who was in ""Titanic"" would ever lower himself to this level. Neither can I. Parents -- avoid at all costs! I fear that Daphne will now get bulimia and live a shortened life."
3,Too gory for my taste,"Movie has a good story line, and good actors. But, to gory and too much foul language for my taste."
5,Gory Can Be Good,"Everyone I know warned me that this movie had too much blood and guts to be entertaining. I really must not be aware of my friends' sensibilities or I have become innured to the real world. For that is what this story is about - the real world. Yes, undercover can be dangerous. Very dangerous. But at last we have a real look at the evil world that surrounds us. Fast pace keeps the viewer interested, twists and turns keep the viewer riveted, and the ending will blow the viewer away! Highly recommended for those who can stand the sight of blood!"
1,"Come on, really!","Sounds good if you're searching for something to help you. It's seems like just a bunch of personalities put together in a somewhat vague way to match whomever the reader is. Can't see anyone getting any help from it, real help.Wonder why it's not mainstream? Perhaps because it's not proven in any way, shape, or form. Look up some of the videos associated with this. Plays the nice silly music in the background, and the people I saw look to be a bit off. Maybe I'm a bit off, don't mean to make fun of people, that's not nice.Stick with DSM-V and the mainstream. I got about half way through it and couldn't take it anymore. It just gets real silly. I would get a refund if I could. Feel a bit suckered."
5,Summer School is the best!,"To this day I still use the expression, ""Cool dude sunglasses"" whenever I'm excited about something. That was the company they write to when someone had the defective sunglasses and then later get a free box of them. I thought Mark Harmon and Kirstie Alley had great chemistry. The movie was on TV recently and I couldn't help but watch it again. It still makes me smile. This is definitely one for the collection."
5,Good Fun esp. for teens,"This very cute movie is good for any age, but esp. teens. Mark Harmon is his usual type A personality that just never gets old. Upbeat attitudes all around."
5,SUMMER SCHOOL was never this fun!!!.....Untill NOW!!,"This film is such a classic and is loads of fun. I never went to summer school but if I did I wish it be this much fun.School Gym teacher Freddy Shoop has big plans for the summer but at the last second is forced to teach summer school.This dvd is re-released for the first time with fun extras including Commentary with director Carl Reiner and actor Mark Harmon, inside the teacher's lounge, summer school year book, photo gallery, and trailer for the film.I got this film as im a fan of the sexy Shawnee Smith (THE BLOB, SAW, WHO'S HARRY CRUMB?) and had a blast with it. I RECOMEND this film for those who want a classic 80's film and want to enjoy a good time with a lot of good laughs."
4,Great work with some flaws,I loved these movies and the soundtrack that came with them. Mamoru Oshii is a genius but there were quite a few flaws that kept me unsatisfied. I wouldn't recommend these for everyone but only for those who like Oshii and anime. If you do it's a definate buy!
3,Good for the price.,"I bought this as an activity for boys age 8-12. They really enjoyed putting them together and even modified them by bending the frame of hhe front wheels. The only negative is that the boys were a bit rough with them so they only lasted about a week. Overall, very satisfied with the product, especially considering the price."
4,Awesome super first shapewear - sucks it in!,"This shaper offers a bunch of ""suck it up"" support. I knew I wasn't buying a miracle for my weight problem, but trying to fit into a bridesmaid dress that was ordered 2 sizes too small was tricky on my own (no joke, one can only loose weight so fast). This shaper really worked hard and helped move and shift parts very well. Sure, it's super tight, but has a bunch of tummy support. Also, the bust cups didn't flatten me, but actually gave me shape and stayed up well. There is a snap crotch which I didn't realize, what a blessing. I have larger thighs so I knew it would be really tight at my bikini line, but it's tollerable considering it could have been a lot worse. Overall, great item for the price! The only way it could have gotten a 5 stars was if it has more thigh room and maybe a tiny bit more tushy coverage - but neither of those items will show in my dress."
1,"Firm - yes, control - NOT.",I ordered this briefer to wear under a bridesmaids dress. It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours of my life. I could have lived with the discomfort if wearing this contraption gave me a sleek look. I don't think it made any difference at all. The bra cups felt more like a shelf than a cup. I could have worn just a strapless bra and achieved the same look with more comfort.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I bought both seasons 3 and 4 of the amazing race and NEITHER SEASON WORKED. All the discs were scratched up and they sent me the wrong invoice slip so I couldnt return them. I bought them in feb so I dont think there is nothing I can do now about it.
5,Nothing short of astounding...,"I'm 15 years old and I read this book because there was a referance to it in another book I was reading(I Know This Much is True--another 5-star book) and it sounded intriguing.Being someone who analyzes things to death, I knew right away that this is the kind of book that you will have your own opinions about and no one's opinions are wrong. For example, I think that iDeath was supposed to symoblize Heaven and the Forgotten Works was Earth(what's been ""forgotten"")Anyhoo, the book is a rare work of art and one of the most inspiring works of literature to ever be published."
3,Alright,There was not as much memory foam as I would of liked but it was alright. I still sleep on it.
2,don't buy !!!,"foam pad seemed to be very comfortable, but only after a few nights the foam lost its memory. or in other words flattened out were we sleep so now my wife and i both sleep in depression. we assumed memory foam would keep its memory?? PLUS THEY WOULDN'T WARRANTY IT!!!! DON'T BUY ITS JUNK!!!"
1,Its not soft and its not comfortable at all!,"I'm sorry to say this is the worst memory foam pad i've ever tried to sleep on. its not soft at all and as you sleep it makes a dent where your weight is and all the foam around you lifts up and pushes at your body. I hate it. I made a mistake in buying it and would return it if it wasn't such a terribly bulky thing to try and wrap up now its aired out.my plan is to make dog beds out of it and i'm out the 99.00 i thought would be an amazing birthday gift to myself.but i'm happy that I finally have used amazon, this was my first purchase on Amazon and in no way do i think this terrible product is a reflection on amazon. it arrived sooner than expected and the box was in shape. I will be back to amazon for many shopping things. but never will i buy something like this again on the internet."
1,mattress topper,"Price was good,shipping was good and it shipped fast,but the product lacked on any support was like rolling up in a peace of foam and we have a serta mattress thats to firm and a 40 dollar mattress pad on top of it,refund was fairly fast once we got done playing phone tag"
2,The Encyclopedia book came old and dirty,I knew I buy a second handed book but I thought it will look nice butit doesn't fit my expectations.The book itself is very helpful for minerals and gemstones collectors.
1,totally stupid,"Dumbest, most amateurish video EVER. My 12 year old could have produced a better children's video. After 1 viewing my older kids implored me to not make the younger kids watch this again. I told them I would give it to the Salvation Army and they said the poor have suffered enough. It went in the trash."
2,Disappointing film with recycled plot,"I watched this movie with my 3 year old son and had high expectations after seeing Antz. I was disappointed by another canned predictable Disney plot. The evil oppresive king and his followers are eventually overthrown by an unlikely hero and his band of misfits. Characters are bland and without dimension, and seem over reliant on funny voices instead of any real character development. Unlike Antz, the ants in Bug's Life have no similarities with real ants. Technically it was fine but the music was a bit monotonous. My son loved it almost as much as his Scooby Doo Cartoons."
1,A Big Letdown!,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It did not live up to the hype. You do not get emotionally attached to the characters. It is just plain boring. Antz was by no means a good movie, but it was better than this. Do not waiste your money."
1,NO SPANISH TRACKS,"If you want your kids to watch this in spanish, BUY THE VHS, because this new edition which is supposed to have an spanish track, doesn't have it. I wasted my money and lost any intention of hearing it in spanish."
5,Excellent for all family members!,I took my kids to the movie at the theatre but I think I bought the video for me! I find myself watching this movie more than they do. This is a great story of triumph. The animation is fantastic. A must see for all ages!!!!!!!
5,This movie was hilarious!,"The computer animatin was stunning, and the humor was wonderful. The outtakes a the end are one of the best parts. This a fine example of how Disney can make comedy work both the levels of adults and children."
4,"Very, very funny and remarkable","A Bug's Life was an outstanding. I don't know anyone who didn't like this movie. Denis Leary was funny as Francis and Kevin Spacey was great too [as Hopper]. I will always remember the ""Hey waiter, i'm in my soup!"" quote. I dont know, just go see this movie. I can't wait to get it on DVD. It'll be nice."
2,+Digital Copy DOES NOT = DVD COPY!!!,"While the BluRay disc is excellent, I had initially purchased this version so that I would have one for the house and a regular DVD for use in the Mini-Van. However, the +Digital copy is not a DVD you can play in your car, it's a copy you can install with a code to your Windows or Apple computer. So much for not having to buy one BluRay and one regular DVD for use in the car. Just don't get fooled. If you want a copy for your computer, this is great, but not what I was expecting."
4,Great Family Viewing,"This film is from the same school as Toy Story. It has a simple plot and a charm that make this a film that you cannot help but enjoy. Although the script is not hilarious, the jokes are certainly enough to keep you smiling through out. As a film this is a thouroughly enjoyable watch all round. As for the DVD version of this film; well its simply stunning and with all these extra features the special edition is a must have for any animated-film fan!"
4,Bug's Life GREAT,This video couldn't be better. Enjoy the helpful stories that instill good behavior actions. Thank you.
5,fANTastic!,"I took my kids to see Flik et al and they could not stop talking about the film for several days! It was Tuck n' Roll this, and then Heimleich that... now that they've heard about the upcoming video release, the buzz has started all over again! Duck for cover!"
5,IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE!!!!!,This was a great film. I would watch this movie any day! and I think everyone should have a chance to enjoy Flicks great adventures!!!!!!!
3,It was pretty funny!,The beginning was kinda boring because they were triing to set up the plot and they didn't do thatpretty well. But when it got going it was pretty good.
5,"Witty, Charming and Downright Funny","My girlfriend made me go to this movie in the theatre and I was not expecting much. Boy was I surprised! This movie had me rolling in the aisles. I especially liked the outtakes at the end. When she bought the movie, we proceeded to watch it many more times and I think I'm up to at least 10. It never fails to make me laugh and every time I watch it, I notice some new aspect that I missed before. The voices are great and so are the jokes. This is much better than ""Antz"". Disney never fails to make movies that appeal to kids and adults. I'm not ashamed to say that I can recite the (extremely funny) dialog along with the movie. Really, ""it's a rock""!"
3,Anthropomorphically Pleasing,"The storyline, acting, voice-overs, embellishments, etc in this film are frankly exquisite, and the applicability to children's entertainment goes without saying. A Bug's Life is a testament to the state of the art.On the other hand, the over-anthropromorphism and gross simplicity of feature of the characters was almost sickening. As if we needed yet another film exemplify to our children that ""four limbs, humanoid face, and walking upright is right"". Heaven forbid we encourage them to understand diversity."
2,The Animation Is The Only Good Thing About This Movie,I saw A Bug's Life at the show at a theatre a three years ago on opening weekend and came completely ripped off and disappointed.What makes this film diapppointing is that it seemed like the writers of the film didn't even try to make the film funny.I guess what I thought it was going to be another Toy Story masterpiece but I guess I was wrong.This is disney's worst animated film.
1,Just plain.....,"I was so excited to finally see the movie. It was a real let down. None of the punch and emotion of ""Toy Story"". I had seen ""Antz"" before this one and I thought ""Antz"" was ok. Compared to ""A Bug's Life, ""Antz"" was great. Don't waste yout time. I don't see how little kids would even like this one."
5,GO GET IT,I just bought this on DVD yesterday and I have watched it three times!! This definetly is one to buy. The picture and sound quality is great!!
5,Cute Movie,"Very cute movie, loved it! We had our Grandson for the night, popcorn & movie night at Nana & Pop's. He wanted t take it home to watch w/ Mom & Dad!"
3,"good movie, but too much ""yelling""","I bought this movie to add to our ""in van"" collection of VHS tapes for a long car trip. I had seen this movie before, and liked it. However, for in the car, there is too much yelling in the movie! Every moment is a crisis that warrent's screaming by the characters. Not a good soundtrack for a car trip, but ok for home (although it may be overstimulating in any environment, depending on the audience)."
2,A Bug's Life has little impact on mine,"Perhaps shadowed by the EXCELLENT film Antz, released around the same, A Bug's Life is a similar premice. It's humor seemed much more directed towards children than adults than I would have appreciated - judged against other Disney successes. It IS possible to create a youth friendly film and yet entertain the parents as well. This film, in my opinion, only achieves the the first."
5,DVD,"This is definitely the complete package of what one excellent DVD , love this movie by Disney, perfect for all ages."
4,it is very amusing,I think A Bug's Life is very funny and exsiting when the grasshoppers stat to bully the ant and forse food out of them. Then one day started to stick up for there self and Flick has a mition to get a some worries togeather he get them and then finds out that they are circus folk.
4,Nice little grow light!,I got this in a timely manner and everything is in good condition. the light bulb is pretty thin only it seems to be fine to me! I am overall pleased with the purchase. The light fixture is pretty light weight and seems to be made of cheap materials which is why I am only giving only 4 stars. I would recommend the item to others based on the price. It was a lot cheaper than anything I could find else where.
4,"Good, but not great","I only have 1 complaint about this system - the reflector lights up an area a bit too narrow to be effective for the whole propagation tray. For fluoro lights, the close to the plants, the better, but if lowering this light to a few inches above the soil, then only the middle of the propagation tray (if you're using one) will get the good light. The light received drops off 25% if you move a few inches off the center, and 50% a few inches after that, so the middle plants will grow faster. out simply, don't put a row of 6 little peat pots across, do a max of 4 and line them in the middle and you'll be fine."
4,Hydrofarm grow light meets expectations.,"The light came quickly after ordering. Only problem was it contained only one clip to attach the light to the cord which raises and lowers the light. I sent an e-mail and received two clips in about ten days. I'm very happy with the light and the shamrocks it's supplying indoors during the winter are loving it, too."
5,Grow light System,"I love this product. Very easy setup. Light weight, but it is easy to put together. Very good instructions. Light works very well. Easy to adjust up and down. I have mine above some herbs in larger pots that I brought inside. I have the frame set up on large concrete blocks I use to raise beds in my garden. This works well. I can adjust the light over these larger pots very well. I have basil, rosemary, thyme, Thai basil, and italian parsley that I brought inside. They are doing very well. 1st time to have them survive inside. My next project is to try seed starting."
3,Questionable to assemble,"Although, I was able to modify the assembly, the parts listed on the instructions did not match what was shipped. The assembly instructions are less than clear."
4,Kaczinski's Real Politics,"Uh, guys, Ted Kaczinski was an anarchist luddite. A nihilist, really. Not exactly a right-winger, but definitely not a commie either. He also opposed equal rights for women, which would seem to put him at odds with mainstream American liberalism. Trying to pin the blame for him on either side of the standard left-right spectrum is a useless exercise."
1,Tricked Me!,"I downloaded the sample ebook for this before purchasing. The first few pages contained a number of apolitical examples of hypocrisy, which gave me the impression that it would be a fair, academic analysis of how smart people end up subscribing to dumb ideas.It wasn't until I purchased the book and made it a little further in, that I realized it is not. This book is very politicized, and makes little effort to discuss the subject in an unbiased manner. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't realize where the author was going until his rant on W. E. DuBois, followed by his suggestion that atheists believe what they do because they're simply too arrogant to believe in anything more important than themselves. Of course this is absolutely absurd and intellectually lazy.This book is not what it pretends to be, and I should have done my homework on it before purchasing. That said, if you're a fan of Glenn Beck (et al), you'll probably enjoy it immensely."
1,He is his Title,"I saw him on CSPANWhen asked about dropping nukes on Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians, Flynn said he was ""conflicted"". He did not say flat out that it was completely wrong. His explanation was that it saved more people as a side effect. Yet numerous times he attacked people whose unethical means were self-justified due to some utopian end. Flynn thus attacked himself, go figure.When asked about the current Iraq war, he said ""im against it"", clarifying his position to a student. However, one reason given to invade by the U.S. was that Saddam was a dictator who killed his own people, and taking him out would naturally mean Iraqis would no longer be subject to his murderous ways, meaning lives would be saved. Therefore, to stay consistent with his own logic, why did he not say, ""im conflicted about Iraq"".I hate to be nit picking here, but Flynn is Fake."
1,JUNK,I installed this on a brand new Dell computer and when I restarted the computer it would not restart Windows. I spent 30 minutes with Dell support to get my computer back up. I did a system restore and then bought McAfee and it works fine. You get what you pay for.
1,hijacker software disguised as protection,"this is the worst ""protection"" software i've ever seen. beware of putting this junk on your computer and then NEVER being able to remove it. there customer service is non-existent. companies like this should be run out of town."
2,"No ""Ghostly"" just Japan","I think there are not even 8 stories involven japanese ghosts in this book. If you are trying to lear about the traditions of the country then you can get some kick, but mostly the book is Hearn philosophizing about traditions and believes and his thoughts on the subjects. Also, I have some knowledge on japanese traditions (which is why I did not want another book on the subject) and I had trouble following this one. Either you have to read it with a searcher at your side to look up all the names and terms you are ""suppose"" to know or you just keep on reading and let it be. The is no glossary and very few of the footnotes relate to the meaning of such words.I did not want another book about japanese traditions, and the description makes is sound as just another book on old western stories greatly interpreted, but it is not. If you care about Hearns thoughts as a japanologist then you get what you want, otherwise find another book and save yourself the tedium."
1,Fell apart the second day we had it!,"This headband fell apart the second day we had it. Definitely NOT worth the money. It's cute, but won't last."
1,"Disappointed, but feel it's not a reflection of the product","Since I live overseas, returns/exchanges are next to impossible. So when I received this headband/tiara with a strip of plastic around it that cannot be removed without ruining the headband, I was VERY disappointed! I am assuming it is a problem with just ""mine"" that I received and not a problem in general since the reviews I read before ordering this item were positive. If you, however, receive your headband with a strip of plastic in the front between the sequins and the headband, do not try to cut it off or remove it as it will loosen the sequins and ruin the ""full effect"" of it (and if like my 4 year old daughter, totally depress her!)"
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,These laptops just arrived at school and boy are they fast.At home we have a dell xps and its much worse than the apple ibook g4
5,Still going strong 2 years later,"I've got a 2004 model 12.1"" iBook, and it's still every bit as great as it was back then. The best way to spell it out is to compare it to my other two notebooks (which were a Compaq and a Dell):- The iBook consistently goes to sleep when I close the lid.- I only need to reboot the iBook an average of once per 5 weeks.- Program crashes are about 80% less than they were with the Windows notebooks.- You can install and uninstall programs on the iBook without them leaving remnants in the registry or other drags on your system.- No viruses or spyware issues.Highly recommended!"
2,everyones a critic.,"I bought Torani Original Mocha Sauce, White Chocolate after reading other reviews raving about this product saying it was just like Starbucks white mocha latte. Well let me tell you its NOT. It has a very strange after taste and I had to use almost a hole bottle to get close to a Starbucks taste. I will not ever recommended this product to any one! Now I have 5 other bottles just gathering dust in my pantry because I dont want to use it."
3,I think I bought it cuz it was the cheapest priced. But thats misleading,I believe it was bought for the low relative price.But I eventually measured the power usage at about 400 watts!!!Thats likely around the consumption of my gaming PC.100 kilowatts a month in the winter seems a tad unreasonable...wonder if all such products are quite as energy hogs.Besides witch the tank was just not large enough and would run out of water before the nights end...
5,Lush Acapella from The Transfer,"Of my two-dozen or so Christmas CD's, the first Christmas CD the Manhattan Transfer released several years ago is my favorite. The new ""An Acapella Christmas"" is a fine partner to that one now. Although I still prefer the first CD for it's big band sound and song selection, this new CD still moves near the top of my Christmas season play list. Favorite songs: ""Toyland"", with very unusual and almost haunting background vocals, and ""Christmas Time Is Here"" -- a beautiful rendition of the well-known Peanuts song. Least favorite song: ""Good King Wenceslas"", where the Transfer's kids get involved and almost hit the right notes. Might make Grandma smile, though."
5,Daughter Loves it,We found this toy at the pediatrician's office. My daughter loved it so much that we are getting her one for Christmas. She especially liked the rocket portion of this toy.
3,returned unused,"after I purchased this little accessory, I decided to return it without using it. It really was an extra that I didn't need and also I don't really have a place to park it."
3,Roomba Self charging Drive On Home Base,"It is not at all obvious, but this unit is included in the purchase of aiRobot Discovery model, so it's not necessary to order it separately.Our iRobot has not yet found it's way back to the Home Base, so I feel this feature is not worth paying extra for."
3,Needs better traction,"It charges fine, but when used on wood floors it rarely sticks in one spot. When Roomba tries to ""mount"" it, the thing slides around and Roomba gets all confused. I had to double up some duct tape and put on the bottom of it so it would stay in one spot."
2,not exactly as advertised,"Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes it doesn't, not a big deal I just pick it up and dock it by hand."
1,Fake reviews,"I'm sorry, the reviews listed as ""kid's review"" are obviously not written by actual children or teens for that matter.The review by ""Ron Burgandy"" obviously was written by a kid, because that's how real kids speak. I can only tell you that this book is a vanity piece to promote this child's career, and not worth reading."
2,Give me a break,"Nice concept, a baseball game for the Atari. Very poor game though. I spend most of my time accidentally, through no fault of my own, throwing the ball to the wrong person and trying to get it back to the pitcher so the game can continue. It's very fun if you throw the ball to the right person, but that happens so few times that I don't think they tested the game before it hit store shelves. If you want a good sports game for the Atari try Basketball.There's nothing real about this game at all."
1,I had to give it 1 star,"Due to the fact you cannot give a 0 star rating I had to give it a 1 star. While it tastes like chicken, it in no way resembles chicken. No chunks, basically it looks like they power washed the bones and that's the chicken you get.I've written to hormel about this as well and about to contact the government as ""Premium Chunk Breast of Chicken"" is NOT AT ALL what this product is.It is a waste of money and time."
1,Wasted lay time !!!,"Product did not work for me I saw no results AT ALL, ive been going for 1 week and 4days..5 times and this IS only a moisterizer, not am accelerator"
2,Don't see much of an acceleration !,It says for experienced tanners ....well 20 years of tanning is good enough for me and this didn't do a thing to my tan. I wouldn't purchase this again or reccomend it to anyone.
4,"Not as good as ""Rebecca.""","This was a great family saga! This had been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I knew the setting was Ireland so that's why I wanted to read it. I was hoping for more about the history of the times in Ireland, like the potato famine. I found it a little strange that the word ""Ireland"" was never mentioned in the book. (I think du Maurier had a reason for that.) The first half of the book is better than the second half. At least, I enjoyed those characters more. It's a great book but if I didn't know I never would have guessed du Maurier wrote it. It's nowhere near as good as ""Rebecca."" (I am a huge fan of ""Rebecca."") The descriptions just aren't as good. But, it is a great read, especially if you like family sagas."
1,DOA Battery - Good Amazon Service,First battery ordered on 4/17 went dead after a couple days. Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement battery is dead on arrival. Now I am the one that feel quilty to ask for either another set or a refund. The Roomba is now just collecting dust together with the brand new 2nd battery. iRobot should change their battery supplier.
2,Didn't Last Long Enough,The battery was great when we first got it but it wouldn't take and hold a charge long enough after about 20-30 recharges.
2,Roomba Battery,"A review of this replacement Roomba battery can't be made until it has been in use for some time. For the first few weeks thusfar, it has functioned properly.However, this is a replacement for another Roomba battery bought through [...] in May 07. That battery, which was used to depletion approximately once a day, began showing signs of deterioration by Oct 07. The original battery that came with the Roomba lasted well over a year when in full daily use. The May 07 battery did not match that performance, and is now used every other day when it runs for about 40 to 45 minutes (and is steadily decreasing) rather than the 90 minutes a good battery should run on carpet."
5,Roomba Battery.... Not IRobot Price,"It's the same battery you would get ordering directly from Irobot, but with free shipping and a lower price tag. It works exactly as advertised giving our old Roomba a new burst of energy and a longer vacuuming time."
1,Wrong battery sent,"The picture I clicked on to place my order was not the battery that was sent to me. The battery store refunded my money, but I did not try to order again as I surmised that the same thing would happen."
4,Battery for Roomba,"The first battery was bad... then we sent it back and the next one we received has been GREAT... We do appreciate you standing behind your products that you send... Thank you, Dave & Darlene Woodruff"
2,Charge Life Bad,The battery only stays charged for about an hour. Not sure if that's normal considering my old one died a quick death.
1,take long time to charge and only can use very short time,It takes long time to charge and it only can use for about 30 mins. and the lifetime of the battery are short --less than a year.
4,Work well. but the picture is not accurate,work well and could last for 50+ mins at least. Not sure if this could be kept for the up coming year or so :)the picture is showing a iRobot Roomba genuine battery. But this is not correct.... it is just an OEM battery.
2,Not as pictured,"This battery works so far, but be aware that it is NOT the Roomba Advanced Power System battery shown in the picture but the much cheaper off-brand that so many others have found defective and worthless."
1,battery does not hold charge,"Battery was very easy to find, easy to purchase and received very quickly.Looked in great shape and was what was ordered. Unfortunely it does not hold a charge and can not be used."
1,1 year and dead,"It worked great at first, but then started dieing after a few months. It is dead a year later. Cannot recommend."
1,Battery does NOT work on my iRobot,"Bought this battery because they said it would work on my series 400 Roomba. It doesn't. Period. Unfortunately, will have to buy genuine iRobot one."
5,Extra Battery,I bought another battery for my Roomba because I thought the original battery was losing it's charge. The real problem was built in charger for Roomba was not working. I still found the new battery useful because after a year of use the original battery had approx 70% capacity of the new battery.Note: I ended up buying an external Roomba APS Battery charger.
2,Yellow Battery Took over a Month to get to me!,Amazon took over a month in shipping me this roomba battery. It works ok. Also the list price is too high on this Amazon site.
3,Just OK,"The Roomba battery is fine. Not as long lasting as I would have preferred, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Slots too small,"We got this block to fit our knives, but were unhappy to find that the medium sized slots did not fit our medium sized knives. Our large chef knife fit in the large slot, though our medium knives were too large. Amazon and/or Mundial should give better descriptions. We ended going with a Henkels block that did fit all of our knives."
2,Worst DVD Transfer Of All Time,"Boy, this movie deserved a better fate. The film looks like mud. One can only hope a more dedicated DVD studio releases a better, cleaner transfer of this noir classic. Are you listening, Roan/VCI/Image/Kino?"
2,I bought for the songs,"I purchashed this cd for the songs hoping that the singer would be able to handle them.Although I am happy to have the lyrics, her renditions are weak. Every song soundslike the last one."
3,oops,The seller was prompt and the book was in great condition. However I thought the photos were in color. This was the reason I purchased the Hardcover edition. The Book did not have any color photos in it and If I'd had known I'd have spent much less on the paperback edition
5,Dear Dr. Codd,"Dear Dr. Codd, I was wondering if you would allow me to meet you in person before you leave this earth. I don't know how else to meet you in this lifetime, but I know that perhaps if I humble myself enough that you may contact me. Please give me a chance, just look at the activity here - nothing - I deserve a chance; I carry your legacy either way; I'm already exposed to it, so it really is not material that I meet you in person or not, but it sure would feel good! metz@fmhi.usf.edu"
4,A thriller from the master of Historical Fiction.,"This is a change of pace for Cornwell. He offers us a spy thriller this time, and he delivers! Set in the world of international terrorism, this was written more than 10 years ago and it is sadly relevant today due to events in recent memory for everybody.It is a short book by thriller standards, but is packed with action, deception and interesting characters. Nothing is what it looks like. The book has a few ""preachy"" passages but overall it is good read."
1,Dickens Was Right,"Wilkie Collins' close friend, Charles Dickens, was right when he wrote to W. H. Wills ""I quite agree with you about ""The Moonstone."" The construction is wearisome beyond endurance, and there is a vein of obstinate conceit in it that make enemies of its readers."" Wilkie's work is a failure both as a novel and as a mystery."
2,"Go ahead and yawn, you won't miss anything","I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; ""Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"""
3,Entertaining but not engrossing,This Victorian Era detective novel is a fun read and it definitely encapsulates the attitudes and social customs of that time. I can't say I was enthralled or felt compelled by the text to keep turning the pages to discover the identity of the thief and solve the mystery. I've read most of the Sherlock Holmes stories and this is a nice companion to them.
1,What you see is not what you will get,"They are out of the Austrian Copper and the Nearly Wild,will ship you four Grootendorsts. I found this out by callingGurneys, the roses were already on their way. Be sure to call them before making a commitment. Good value however, $29.95through the Gurney website, $22.26 through Amazon."
3,decent Spanish rock,"Dikers have been around for a while - this is in fact their fourth effort (!). They started out when they were just adolescents and have gradually matured. They seem more musically confident and their poetic lyrics are original (whereas in their first two albums they had a friend from another band write them - really!). Still, for a fourth effort, it could be better. I still think, in fact, that their best album is their second, the self-reflexively titled ""Se Escribe Sin 'C'"" (this translates as ""There's No 'C'"", in reference to their name.) Singer Iker (maybe that is where their band name comes from?) is now well into his 20s but still has a distinctly adolescent voice... if only it could be a tad deeper! Overall, though, this record is decent. Think distorted guitars and catchy melodies. Think a less polished version of American groups like Taking Back Sunday, New Found Glory and Finch."
2,Brides of Destruction,"Not nearly as good as ""Here Comes the Brides"" - the first CD. This one sound old and tired. I would only recommend this is you are a fan of the band or Nikki Sixx and have already bought the first Bride's album."
4,Good but not better than the first.....,"I think this band had some potential, but hey look at todays Music environment,,,so drowned out from real talent..original muscicianship that does not suck. Everyone is trying to make a buck by trying to push the same generic crap.... Anyways my two cents...I think this album is good overall and is fun to listen to yes has more nu---metal sound to it than the other one with N.Sixx I do think Traci was crazy leaving L.A. Guns , I heard them recently in Detroit, wow they sounded real good, awesome guitarist got their autographs heard the whole Cocked and Loaded album live, thats a must see..... Well anyways I think this album is worth listening too and grows on you but needed a little something more.... Check out Kill Switch Engage.....cool and original..I think....."
5,overlooked band,"Boy, I forgot about this band. What a treat to find them again. Great compilation of songs for those that don't want to purchase all their CD's. Great gift for that 80's lover, as well."
1,No Serial Number in Box,"Box came with no paperwork whatsoever. No serial number. The serial number is, of course, the thing you pay for. After all the reviews here that mention this problem, you might think that they'd fix it. But not yet.Best of luck with your purchase. Caveat emptor."
1,Won't insatall,"I can't review the actual software because in order to install it you must type in the serial number ""from the CD box"". However there is no such number so it cannot be installed."
1,A real bore,"Reading about this book in a Self Magazine article, I decided to read it for myself.I nearly didn't finish the book. By the second chapter I nearly put the book down as the characters were so repulsive to me. Still I forced myself to read on. Halfway through the book I finally had to just skim through the rest of it so that I could get to the end. Too long, too convoluted with rather crude characters and no where near enough romance or even sex for that matter. The sex that happens is some of the most mediocre I've ever read. The book almost redeems itself in the last couple of chapters by actually getting a little bit interesting but you shouldn't have to wait until the end of a book to finally get interested. Just overall a very trying book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
1,"What Is ""Hilarious"" About Blonds Being Beaten and Killed?","From the back cover:""Until I wrote Fancy Pants, I didn't know I could make readers laugh. But laugh they did, and I finally found my voice as a writer"".Beautiful blonde teenaged woman beaten and molested.Beautiful blond teenaged man beaten.Beautiful blond toddler dies by drowning.Blond parents badly traumatized and mated to not-blonds in what author apparently thinks is happy ending.Mother of stupid obnoxious heroine in designer clothes killed by vehicle after stupid obnoxious heroine's father killed in auto accident.What exactly is supposed to make me laugh?I wanted a good read. This was a stressful waste of time and money."
3,Not too bad,"I didn't think that I would like this book, but I can appreciate how one of the main characters(Francesca)evolved. It starts off like most romance stories (I almost gave up many times),I hate sappy romance novels with no real depths to them -and this one almost comes close, but it has some redeeming qualities.It's ok."
2,Fancy Pants - a big disappointment,"This story was very long winded and proved to be a big disappointment. After reading Ain't She Sweet (which was hilarious) and ""It had to be You,"" I expected a story line with lots of humour and unexpected turns. Fancy Pants did not deliver. It was boring and predictable with attempts at humour, but it simply fell flat on its face."
3,Fancy Pants needs tighter elastic!!!,"In Fancy Pants, Susan Elizabeth Phillips introduces us to two excellent characters - the spoiled rich witch and the down-home down on his luck golfer. Unfortunately, I found it a real slog to actually get to where these two are introduced! I realize the necessity of a well-developed back story, but I felt rather smothered by it in this book. Sparks fly when Francesca and Dallie are together, but they're not together often enough or early enough. As always, Ms. Phillips' writes a thoughtful book, with lovely secondary characters, and vibrant leads. But I find her books erratic - ""Nobody's Baby"" had a delightful wit and charm which I missed in the sequel. Here, there seems a combination of humor and desperation! Perhaps I have become used to books requiring less involvement by the reader, but I would not recommend this book to a friend who had not read any of Ms. Phillips' work - start with ""Nobody's Baby""!"
1,"After reading, this book left an AWFUL taste in my mouth!","In one word, this book was AWFUL! The characters, except for Desiree and Aletha, were not well developed, the plot seemed very unreal, and with every character there seemed to be an issue of race in one way or another, mostly negative. I think the author should have left out the other four characters because, apparently, they lacked depth. Judging from the outcome of this book it seemed that she could not sucessfully handle all six characters in one book. It was truly pathetic! Ms Tyson needs think twice before she gives up her day job!!"
3,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!,"Started out great, but bogged down toward the end---not enough characterization on some of the ""gingersnaps,"" only focusing it seems on three of them. What happened to Veronica? Only one chapter devoted to her and we never read anything else about her and the man in her life. Come on!"
3,Words to grow on...,"This book is definitely missing a few pertinent things. Aletha and Desiree, Snaps 1 & 2, were the only characters that we really got to know. The other women featured appeared to be undeveloped drop-ins. The book would have needed another 300-600 pages to give them more depth. If they had not been made main characters (per the flap), perhaps the reader would not have been so anxious for more on them. Fortunately, the Christmas dinner at the Browns made up for some of the lull. I believe that this author has potential. Please take the criticism given by your readers constructively, not negatively. Your next work will benefit from it. Please keep writing because everyone deserves another chance.. God Bless!"
1,When do we get to the good part,"When I read the preview of this book I thought it was going to be about sisters that had it together and had something to say. This book turn out to be a bunch of dsyfunctional sisters who all had self inflected issues. I read alot of books and this one was definetly a waste of time. Can someone please tell me ""What was the point""."
4,worth the money,"these are well worth the money. I use these on my job; maint. and machinery repair and i like that these have a very thick shaft, no twisting of shaft when trying to break a bolt loose. It would have been nice to have a few more sizes in the set. I would have paid for them. I like this set so much I just ordered the metric set. the platsic case is nice also."
1,This program is not even worth 1 star. Don't waste your $,"Sure, the editing tools are great and it can make even the simplest MPEG's look great. But it never works and tech support will put you through the ringer trying to get it to run again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled more time than I care to remember. I have fixed system files I didn't even know existed. Don't waste your money. I am still trying to get Roxio customer service to answer me about getting money back so I can purchase something decent. We only bought this for the DVD capabilties as we have a newborn baby and I have in three months of having this software not been able to create a single DVD, only a whole bunch of CD's for friends and family."
1,Are these reviews for real ?????,"Who is fooling who. Compare the review dated July 29, 2003 (1 star)with the short review dated Jan 14, 2003 (5 stars). Copy and paste right down to the word ""to"" sic for ""too."""
3,Dubious or poor scholarship?,"It's an interesting book, but when he gets to Islam things get very shaky and dubious to say the least. He refers to Muhammad as a ""messiah"", which is completely false. He also refers to Muhammad as a Don Quixote type figure, meaning delusional. So, the author doesn't remain objective whatsoever. Then again, the author is jewish. It's funny how in the introduction the author speaks as if he isn't jewish. He refers to the jewish people in the 3rd person. Very dubious."
5,Great updated edition,"2nd or 3rd time reading this and I love the additional content. Like the critics say, it's so well-researched, erudite, yet comprehensible and excellent narrative style. Facts are easy to follow and absorb b/c of clarity and analysis. Also learned so much. Have tried reading other works to understand today's conflict in Middle East, but just keep coming back to Max Dimont to help understand the history - both course of events and context - in an enjoyable way."
4,A Great Read for the Christian Parent,"This book has a lot of great content and a message that Christian parents and educators need to hear. It also has a lot relevance to those who many not be Christians but want the best education for their children. The author lays out universal principles that are applicable over the board, not a specific curriculum that will be outdated in five years. I would definitely recommend this book to others. I gave it four star only because I reserve five star for the best of the best."
5,The Traveling Wilburys,Great set. It was impossible to find in stores so I'm happy that it was offered. The DVD is an excellent bonus.Diane
5,This CD Rocks!,"Thanks to Olivia Harrison for re-releasing the Traveling Wilburys CD's as well as this DVD set. The music is super -- even better than I remembered. For some reason which I can't remember, I never purchased the original recordings yet have been looking for these for years. Buy this set -- you won't be sorry. The songs are fabulous. How could they not be with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and friends? What talent. Put the CD on to play, close your eyes, and it's like some familiar and talented friends are jammin' in your living room!"
2,"The book binding was seperated, and has a 2 inch rip on binding/cover","I thought the book was to be in good condition when I placed my order. I was disappointed, and have placed another order elsewhere for a replacement. The cost was cheap, fortunately my co-worker has interest in it and will keep it since it was so cheap. I just didn't expect it to be as beat up as it was."
1,Truely a Green Hell,"As I buff of the ""oldies"" of filmdom, I must admit this is perhaps the worst of them all.Stock footage of many jungle flicks, tons of talk and in about the last 15 minutes we get treated to the superimposed plastic wasps that eventually get over shot with see through sceens of an erupting volcano. Sitting through of about 70 minutes of this movie is truly hell in B&W;."
2,Big Bugs Go Boom!,"Scientists send bugs into space. One of their bug-rockets crashes, releasing radiated wasps in (Green Hell) Africa. The wasps grow into bizzy, buzzy, slow-moving behemoths of death! Many natives are devoured before the scientists (including Jim Davis as Dr. Quent Brady) arrive to set things right. They go on a 400 mile safari, and we feel every laborious step! Thankfully, our heroes bring their secret weapon along. I'll betcha didn't know that scientists were so handy with grenades, now didja?? MFGH is a true test of endurance. Even if you like dull movies, this one will cause bed sores! Not quite as boring as THE SNOW CREATURE, but close. Check it out if you are in desperate need of sleep..."
5,Great product!,I have been purchasing gold well for years and really like this conditioner. After using it there isn't any build up on my hair and the smell of it is clean. I have long thick dry hair and this product seems to add moisture to my hair.after blow drying my hair looks much less frizzy and has a good shine.
1,NOT THE REAL THING!,Ive used this conditioner for quite some time now and let me tell you this is FAKE! its thin and smells nothing like Kerasilk! Dont waste your time!
4,Leona Helmsley's Trust Fund Mutt Never Had It So Good,"Rhubarb, H. Allen Smith; Doubleday & Co. (1946)If you can survive the hilarious ""Dedication,"" you're on your way sailing through a very creatively silly & rewarding experience - despite the book's length (the author also went overboard with his even funnier ""Smith's London Journal,"" published in 1952).Incidentally, H. Allen Smith ought to be elected to the Ouija Hall of Fame for creating the then-fictitious Thaddeus Whitcomb Banner - an eccentric, bombastic owner of a New York major league baseball team.Only 27 years later, along came the real thing - George Steinbrenner."
3,Cruciflicks' Review,"""...the storyline for ""Hidden Secrets"" is fairly interesting. There's enough material here to keep pretty much anyone's attention..."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""... it was easy to relate to most of the characters and their struggles with, well, not being perfect. In the end, ""Hidden Secrets"" is a movie about forgiveness. While I don't believe most people forgive as easily as the characters in this movie, it still offers a ray of hope for all of us screw-ups who are desperately searching for forgiveness."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
3,Cups run small,"This product is very soft and nice and as mentione by another person in the below review, its got a very nice feature; that its does not have a racer back but the normal back with front closure.And also, if the straps were a little narrower, it would be excellent.People who are not looking for bulky padding, stay away from this one!"
4,Indian Heritage,I am very pleased with the book: AMERICA'S FASCINATING INDIAN HERITAGE.This was a gift for my husband. He had wanted it for some time. I had ordered it from another company and returned it because it was not in the condition advertised. Thank you for honest advertising!!
2,Premiere 6.5 -- Unstable,"While Premiere 6.5 is easy to use, it is very unstable. I have used Premiere 6 and it was not nearly as unstable as 6.5. 6.5 is not a good upgrade from Premiere 5 or 6. I would suggest going directly to Premiere Pro. Invest in Total Training for novices, it's well worth it. I wouldn't waste my money on Premiere 6.5. However, most of Adobe Premiere Products are great and have excellent features, and they interface wonderfully with Canopus."
3,Nice Birdhouse,"I got several of these birdhouses for my Dad. He is quite pleased with the birdhouses but recommends that people who are not mechanically inclined and experienced with tools attempt these things. He bought extra screws and bolts for this project. After a bit of customization, he was quite pleased with the birdhouses. Don't buy these kits to assemble with young children. You probably shouldn't get one of these if you find Ikea furniture kits challenging."
2,Can you say Erector set?,"I did not see anywhere on the box where assembly was required. The house is made up of about 72 seperate sections you put together with hundred of tiny nuts and bolts in tight corners. Can you say Erector set? Of course, they include three warnings that all the metal pieces are sharp and they are, so be careful! I sat in front of the television watching the football game while assembling. Directions were ok, but could have been much better. I did have to backtrack and fix some things before getting into a rythmn and doing it on my own. Definitely not for someone that might have a hard time with assembly."
3,Martin House,"Beautiful to look at; however, I gave it a poor grade because of the difficulty we had in putting it together. The pieces did not line up well and my husband had to redrill holes to make it fit securely."
1,It worked twice then quit,"I used this twice and the third time I plugged it in, it sparked and now does not light up or charge. What a rip."
2,Shooting Lever Guns of the Old West,Just skims over everything not much detail thought there could have been more info. Venturino is suppose to be an expert onThis stuff
5,well i love it,so i read the reviews and i happen to love all the songs that everyone seems to hate on soo much. im not a huge fan so im guessing that those are probably hardcore fans from when jaguares used to be caifanes. my fave song on here is te lo pido por favor. Love it. so I'm very happy with my purchase.
3,"Jaguares Rule, But This One...","I am a diehard fan of Caifanes/Jaguares, as they truly are the best of the major rock bands out of Mexico. This latest recording of acoustic and tropical interpretaions, however, just does not leave me with those mystical vibes I get from their other works. Not that it's bad, Primer Instinto does have it's moments, like ""por un beso"", ""Viento"" and ""arriesgate"". The thing is that most of these new versions are simply not as compelling as the originals.Also, the English translations, found in the cover are awful. They are literal translations which do not capture the true meaning and feeling.That having been said, I want to stress once again, that Jaguares are a great band, just chack out ""cuando la sangre galopa"" to find out what I mean. But, unless you are a true fan, I would avoid this one."
4,renaissance keeping it real deep,this album is very good disk 1 is incredible very well mixed disk 2 is good too but doesnt flow like the first disk its very deep has great transition and is a definite must have
5,Top of the line!!,"This is a wonderful keychain. Very well made, and durable. Anything with Washington Redskins is top quality. Would highly recommend this product to any fan!! Shipped fast!! Very pleased!!"
2,Utterly Pointless.,"Love Hina - Christmas Movie provided the closing remarks. It gave what viewers wanted by letting Keitaro and Naru join together as a couple and fellow students at the college of their dream. It was nice to see that they decided to finish the series in good note in which Episode 24 didn't. BUT...Instead of leaving the series at the top of shape, they decided to milk it as much as it can. And the result is Love Hina - Spring Movie.Unlike Christmas Movie, this provides no additional plot, nor extra material such as Episode 25 (it is useless, however). It is covered with sameless that starts to wear thin, and 45 minutes of movie starts look as if it would never end. I can't see any justification of purchasing this movie, since this is pointless part of the series. Very disappointing."
3,D'Amour,"This is a bizarre collection of short films - very Euro, bizarre scenarios. Ozon is a French filmaker of some reknown in France but not in the States. Unless you are a fan of offbeat plots, unknown actors with the exception of Garrel then this is not for you. The only viable short is the one with Garrel however that's a bit disapointing compared to any of his other works."
1,STAY AWAY....,"I have these bowls. I used my hand mixer (these are ""mixing bowls"") to make mashed potatoes. When I was finished, I noticed my mashed potatoes had tons of tiny red specks throughout. Don't buy these unless you like to eat plastic!"
5,"Flandry faces his final betrayal, and his greatest foe.","Anderson's recurring hero, Dominic Flandry, is like Horatio Hornblower, shown at different points of his career. In this, he is middle-aged, with a grown son...and in his final battle with a mind-reading foe from an elder race he has fought many times before. It is their final battle, and in it Flandry is not only betrayed, but goes through a self-betrayal of many of the principles he believes in. In this one, Flandry ceases to be a pleasure-loving, decadent Simon Templer, and instead shows true depth of character, and indeed, true tragedy, on several fronts. Easily the best of all the Flandry books, which is high praise indeed"
1,"The blu-ray does not work , the movie doesn't run","I bought this movie and when i insert it in the blu-ray player , the movie does't run, it displays a black screen and the menu doesn't appear, so please fix this problem because it its very annoying to buy a movie and then be unable to see it, check the existence of all this movies and if you find any mistake in the recordig fix it to prevent any other client from suffering this inconvenience."
4,The Heat is On.,"Ah the 80's, such style and great music. Eddie Murphy the go-to comedian of the decade. Hot off Saturday Night Live his film debut 48Hrs. and this essential classic Beverly Hills Cop which early on was a script meant as a action flick for Sylvester Stallone. Murphy made this movie an instant hit from the opening scenes until the climatic end. Cop would go on a spawn a high-octain sequel and a turd of a third entry, But Cop I remains the best of the action/comedy films of the decade in which it came. Paramount debuts BHC with a decent PQ presentation. Things open up with lots of grain and eventually goes to a smooth glossy finish. AQ fairs a little bit better as this soundtrack is as important to the story as it's characters. Bonus features are all ported over from the DVD special edition thus picking up this one is a no brainer."
5,NICE AND DIFFERENT!,"If you are looking for the standard hits packages some have come to know and love (or get really tired of), this CD is not for you. It actually contains on a couple of her charted hits--the majority are Lp cuts of songs with a love theme spanning 1959 to 1968. Her version of ""La Vie en Rose"" in French and English is a delight. Several cuts from one of her best composer-themed Lps, ""Sings Burt Bacharach"" still stands the test of time. This CD has been in print all over the world for many years (except here), and is one of Connie's seminal reissues. The quality of selection explains it's broad appeal and shows Connie's growth from a ""Teen Idol"" to a powerhouse intepretor of American standards. A great collection for all music lovers. The fans will certainly want this one for it's diversity alone. Highly recommended."
3,Typical But Good,"Very well done but tiresome as over drenched reverb/delay guitar can get. With that said it is typical every album type surf music, nothing different or new here but not bad either. One CD by these guys is all you'll ever need by them. Nothing left to play that hasn't been played already by a zillion other surf bands. Worth getting but it might only get one listen because once you have heard a couple songs, you have heard them all. Not sorry I bought this CD, just have a bunch of others very much the same by many different groups. Here are two really fantastic, excellent, great surf CD's;1) The Fathoms ""Fathom This!""2) The Blue Stingrays ""Surf N Burn""Now those two are surf CD's supreme......I'd buy Surf Sensation again if I lost it or loaned it and never got it back but only because I collect surf music, not that it is great."
4,One to ponder,"The author manages to evoke gut wrenching emotions she tellsthe tale of a young Alaskan woman,Kate, who seems to attract ill fortune wherever she goes.Filled with baited suspense, a hint of humour, some actionand a touch of romance, Dana has you ""eating out of her hand"" beforelong."
1,Jerry Rocks!,"On page 260 you mention one of the most beloved pastors I have ever known, casting him in a bad light for saying abortion is murder. I have not seen him for years, but he was always a person of real intelligence, grace, integrity, and compassion. Does the unborn have intrinsic value? Does the unborn child deserve rights of protection? Does human life have value??? Pastor Prevo would say it does. Why? Because we are created in God's image. Also the abortionist is a person of value made in God's image and Pastor Prevo would never endorse in any way killing an abortionist...and he makes that clear. This excerpt in your book which I read here online does not give enough context for me to know how you will resolve the situations in your book. I hope it is not just a rant against religion...that the character on page 260 is not speaking for your own views. Since I don't know and am not going to buy it and read it I will end my comments."
5,THE SIMPLE LIFE,"At first I thought this was going to be the worst and dumbest show ever. Its a good thing I watched it to see how hilarious it would be!! This Seven Episode series was full of hilarious scenarios and outragous humor such as When Paris thought Wall-Mart was a store for walls, or when Nicole and Paris started the kissing booth, and the two of them had no underwear on. It was also funny to see that the family had never heard of the Paris Hilton video or when Nicole and Paris saw the only bathroom. There are soo many more that if I tell you my review will exceed the limit. I am looking forward to adding this to my collection tommorow when it comes out January 20, 2004."
4,it is edited,"Great show, very funny. I am very happy to have all the eposides at my despense anytime I want them and hope they do a second season. They may not because Paris is got a cd coming out soon. To answer the question about the langauge yes unfortuntaly fox has chosen to keep the show in the same version that aired on tv, It's not just the dvds from Wal Mart. That is the only reason I deducted one star."
3,Voulez Vous en Asprin?,"As the French comedy ""Battement de Coeur,"" this must have been oh so charmant. Mais. En Anglais, and directed by the torpid Sam Wood, it's the epitome of an old movie on the late, late show. Ginger Rogers tries hard but this is her umteenth version of ""Cinderella"" and the strain is starting to show... Basil Rathbone jumps at the chance to play something besides Sherlock Holmes, but as so often, his comedy style consists of raised eyebrows and scampering around the set. Not the finest hour of either of these two great stars. Quelle drag, n'est ce pas?"
3,Sólo rock n' roll (pero le gusta),"Gilby Clarke pudo sacarse el estigma del segunda guitarrista. El ex Guns n' Roses demuestra en este disco que está al frente de una banda que pueda tocar rock del bueno. Correcta selección de los temas, aunque faltan los covers Dead flowers y Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Los que alguna vez asistieron a alguno de sus conciertos no se sorprenderan, pero tampoco se sentirán defraudados. Fanáticos de Five y Britney Spears por favor abstenerse."
5,dvd quality,"the package came in sooner than was expected, and was in very good condition. no scratches or scrapes."
4,Not a Necessity,"If you breast feed exclusively, these are awesome to use as storage containers for excess breast milk. However, if you give your baby a bottle, I would suggest getting the 3-pk of 4 oz. bottles and buying a pack of sealing disks. You can save some $$$ that way."
5,Great Versitile Item!,"I love these containers... The one thing that would be an improvement would be if they added the nipples and covers. I would gladly pay extra for the benifit! I use these for storing milk and love the fact that I don't have to pour milk from the container to the bottle, but can just add a nipple, warm and serve!"
4,My name is Bond.....James Bond,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.....I know, I know, I know.....Bond wears a Seamaster and before that a Rolex Submariner.....I just received this watch as a gift from my wife in honor of our anniversary and although I have not had a chance to delve into all of its features yet, I am already extremely thrilled about this watch. I don't travel a lot internationally but I do have many international business contacts which require careful considerations with respect to time differences. I used to go on the internet to check the world time before phoning them, now I just push a few buttons on my watch and I'll know what time it is anywhere in the world at my conveniece.Another reviewer said the watch's weight might be a concern, but frankly, I rather relish it. As my parents used to say, ""If it's heavy, it's probably expensive."""
1,NOT FOR CANON NB-2L,"Ordered this item because the description said it was for the Canon NB-2L battery. However, when I tried to use it, my battery would not fit. I checked the package, and the packaging actually said that it was for the Canon NB-1L! I have since sent it back to Amazon, and am hoping that I get a full refund even though the box was open, but it had a false description. I'm sure it would be a great charger for the batteries that it is made for, but DO NOT get this if you are looking for a charger for your Canon NB-2L battery."
1,A dull account of a dull life.,"I was lured into buying this book by the picture of Ebbets Field on the cover and the implied promise of insights into, and memories of,Brooklyn in the fifties. I am just three years younger than the author, and I hoped for some interesting reading about a time and place that defined my childhood but that I was too young to notice at the time. Memoirs must serve at least one of three purposes. They either describe an interesting life, or they offer insights into a time and place, or they are simply well written and stand on literary merit alone. This book fails all three tests. The life is not interesting, the time and place are merely touched upon and poorly understoof, and the writing has no literary merit. Save your money."
3,Okay if you like baseball,"Of course, this is a different type of writing than ""Team of Rivals"" or her other big stories; however, I got tired of the constant references to the Dodgers. I understand that she associates her relationship with her father with the Dodgers, so okay. It was interesting to read about her childhood as I really enjoy finding out how people coped with childhood."
3,BFBA'S Thoughts,"I enjoyed parts of this book. The parts I enjoyed were the parts that did not go into detail about baseball. The story of her life was well written and interesting and baseball was a part of her life. There was just too much information about individual games, pennant races etc for me. What the author included about growing up in the 50's and 60's was the reason I gave it 3 stars."
1,Useless to me...,"I bought this to ship to me in Afghanistan, since it would be easier than asking my wife to go to the grocery store and then to the post office. Good price and fast shipping, but now I have to order a can opener. The item image depicts a pull-tab can which was my main concern, but the package that arrived did not have these tabs. If this is your concern, like mine, then don't buy.As for the taste or quality of the meat, well I'll just have to wait and see."
4,very good,Hershel Bernardi is as good as Zero Mostel in the role of Tevye. And this CD has one song that was cut from the play (When the Messiah comes).
5,the best fiddler score,Herschel is the best singer for the score to this play. You will not be disapointed by this.
3,colored ink,Purchased for a project and they did the job. I never used this product before and they were easy to use.
2,These are teeny tiny!,"On the one hand, I paid $3.50 for them, and they do what they are supposed to do: Cover bowls.On the other hand, these are so small that the only bowls they're covering are cereal bowls, and I didn't really need them for that. I'm sure that, at some point, I will, so I didn't throw them out, but meh. They're really small, and incredibly flimsy. I could poke through one without much effort at all."
4,"Not A Bad Mower, But...","This is probably a pretty good mower. I bought it on sale because my 18 year old Lawn Boy began acting up. This one has started the first try every time.But, this is really just a Toro mower with green paint and a Lawn Boy sticker. Toro bought out Lawn Boy several years ago, and the transformation is now complete. Gone are the old two cycle Lawn Boy engines. Now you can have a Tecumseh or a Honda engine, same as on a Toro, and I doubt either one will last as long as my old 2 cycle Lawn Boy."
3,works well but my laptop didn't recognize,"For some reason, this brand of memory card didn't work on my laptop. It worked well in the camera, but when i went to transfer the files by putting this in the laptop slot, my computer wouldn't recognize it. I had to use the USB cables to transfer photos and videos.Not sure what the issue is, but I'm not going to blast it because it does store the items well enough. If I didn't have USB cables that would be another matter.I hope you find this review helpful!"
4,Good product - Great Price,I wanted a SD card for my Digital Photo Frame which I will be giving to my family back home. I tried this sd card in my digital photo frame and it is working fine. I do not think I will face any problem in future as I have used Transcend products before and I have had good experience. Overall good product for a great price.
5,SDHC flash memory card,"an incredible price for a card of this quality and size, bought for use in our camcorder and does a perfect job"
4,it works,I use this card in my camera to record HD video it works well. i would buy again if I needed one
1,Don't buy this,I purchased this for my Poloroid Camera but I got defective piece. When I inserted this to camera it says card error so not working at all. Brand name is also not so popular so don't buy it.
5,8GB flash memory card,"This card works great, Canon G10 formatted is correctly and it has almost 8GB of space, perfect for camera. I had plenty of room for pictures from a two week trip."
1,Card Locked error so no holiday snaps.,"When transferring my holiday pictures to my Vista PC the process hung up, then the PC re-booted (only after I removed the card and allowed some recovery routine to run). Upon re-boot the card was unreadable on the PC, it simply did not see it. I replaced it in the camera and got ""Card Locked"" even though the locked tab was not in the locked position. Not too impressed with this at all. I've only had the card 2 months, it was really nice when it worked, fast transfers were great. Not sure what caused the problem, ie PC or card, but I've lost some nice wilderness shots/footage.******************* some time later**********************************I returned the card to Transcend and they quickly sent a replacement card, along with an apology and a $5 coupon for their online store. They do seem committed to customer satisfaction which is nice. Shame about the lost data though. I'd rate the card higher now if I could."
4,"well, it works","What can you say? It was priced well, came quickly, and works. Not too much sexy about a memory card."
1,Stay away. Product defective !!!,I tried this card with my Canon S5. Only after several minutes it started to show writing errors. I also bought Kingston 8GB SDHC and it is working like a charm after several days on Tahoe in very cold weather.
5,Less Expensive Memory For Sony Camera,"I bought this 8gb card for my new Sony DSC-TX7 which takes photos and records 1920x1080i hd video in avchd format, and is one of the few Sony cameras not limited to Sony memory stick types. I contemplated buying a Sony card which is more expensive but after researching came to the conclusion this less expensive card would offer good performance. So far it works great. Writing and reading speed for video and photos has been excellent, no issues. As long as it remains reliable it's a good buy."
2,Won't keep up with HD video,"I bought this to use in a GoPro Helmet Hero HD video camera. At 720p and 60fps settings, the card won't keep up with the camera even though some Class 4 cards I've used will. I'm going to have to relegate this card to still camera use. I had good luck with the Sandisk 16gb video card which is only rated at Class 4.SanDisk SDSDHV-016G-A15 16GB Video HD SDHC Card (Black)"
3,Shipping ripoff,"Product was fine, I ordered two and they charged me the full shipping rate on each of them even though they shipped them together. Feel that was a shipping ripoff."
4,It is 6GB not 8GB,I bought this one and very happy about it. It is fast and responsive but it has only 6gb usable space. not 8GB as adverstised
1,"Works great, then dies without warning. 40 days.","Worked well until Week Six, when it died. Unilaterally changed its own status to ""read only"" -- meaning, you can't take more pictures until you buy a new one.This is when I said to myself, ""Maybe I should have read those hundreds of one-star reviews ..."""
4,"Great Price, Gets The Job Done","I cannot compare it to other items, because it is the only SDHC card that I have used. I have 2. First one was $17.49, second one which came with the card reader was $21.38."
1,Not really good sdhc compare to other brand,"I have bought 3 of these when it was so cheap around $3.25ish (shipping included) I was basically fooled by the low price. The product came on time with nicely packaged. I used fine for about 3 months. Techinically used about 4~5 times. And my camera is able to read it but it cannot read from my computer. I tried testing on different computers, but still doesn't work. So I would definately say it's defect (2 unopened). I actually read lot of reviews sandisk vs transcend before buying. But in the end it was like this. Even though return policy of the store I bought from is 30 days, they gave me full refund on all 3 since the cost of sending to transcend company to re-issue new ones will out price the cost of the card. I guess I'm going to stick with sandisks from now on. They never failed me with CF on my Canon EOS."
2,Large Capacity for a good price: very slow write times,I cannot record in high quality with my digital point and shoot camera without this card chocking after about 10 seconds from not being able to maintain the write speed necessary. I therefore have to film in standard quality or just use it for photos. My 8 GB card with the same write/read speed has no problem maintaining the high quality film setting.
1,Dissatisfied,It's a good thing this card was so inexpensive because it worked for all of 12 hours before failing. We lost all the pictures taken during that time because of this shotty memory card. I'm very disappointed.
5,It is what it is. Gets the job done,Of course would like bigger space but for the price and what I wanted for I really can't argued with that
1,Died almost right away,I only use it to transfer some files a couple of times and it refused to mount on my Mac using a Transcend USB Card reader. Tried to reformat it with no luck. Figure I will get two smaller cards next time Only good thing is it showed how good Amazon's return system works.
5,Great purchase,Received the memory card quickly and in brand new pkging...used it for a trip to Europe and it indeed held all the images/videos my heart desired!
5,huge!,I'm happy with my purchase. This memory card gives me and hour of recording time on my camera. (: Now I have to buy another battery...lol
3,Does not work in Sony camera,Product is not correct for Sony video camera but it works in my niconcool pix so now i have a second one.
1,GARBAGE,I purchased a transcend 8 GB flash card for my new leica. I hate it it totally sucks. I lost two days of pictures one of a newborn baby camel. It just took a dump the pictures where recorded but it lost everything1 I would never trust anything from this company again. This has never happened to me i have used many other brands with much success all over the world. This one is GARBAGE
1,Damaged product,"The memory card is not working. It shows an error message in the camera when I try to use it, and this is happening when I am having my vacation in Europe. What a bummer?How can I get an exchange or refund?Albert Chiang"
4,4 GB SD card,"Make sure your equipment can read High Capacity ""HC"" SD cards. The industry change the technology but not the form factor. I bought this thinking it would work in anything SD, but it doesn't. It only works in my newer equipment. Great card though! Can't beat the price!Josh"
4,what can I say... it's a flash card,"Hey it's a 8 GB class six flash card that works well. No problems thus far, easy to get out of the box and it was cheap. Wins my vote."
2,Watch out!,"I have been using the card in my Canon 450.....twice the camera issued a message, while taking pictures, that the card was unformatted....Once I get this message I am locked up until I power the camera off, unseat and reseat the card.......then it seems to work fine until I get the next message.....So, I purchased another 8GB card from a different vendor and so far have not had any problems. I got the message once while shooting continuously and I filled the cameras memory......might be that this card really isn't a class 6 as advertised..."
3,It's just an SD card,Using in a Canon SX1IS camera. The 1080p video writes fine. Cannot detect and appreciable lag. Only complaint - how can they call this an 8 gig card when in reality you can only access a little over 7 gig?
4,Summary,Got what was ordered and expected in timely fashion! word word word word word word word word word word word
5,Excellent Service!,The package was arrived much before estimated time. I already took lot's of pictures and I got very good price.Thanks
4,Transcend 16GB Memory card review,"Pretty good product. Good for usage of taking still photos. Can contain 5000 pictures.Can't comment for video shoot, but quite good for still pictures."
2,Worked for 2 months and then died right at an important event...,"Bought this SD card when I bought my Canon DSLR. Worked well and the write speeds were really good. I was able to continously shoot 3 RAW+JPEG(~13Mb) frames in a second. But, the big day comes and I am preparing to shoot an event. Formatted the SD card, kept it all ready. Took may be 10 pictures at this event and I get a card error. Tried to format again and it failed. Luckily I had a smaller 2GB Kingston with me and ended up just shooting JPEGs.Tried formatting the SD card at home on the desktop and still no luck. Looks like its corrupt."
5,SD Card,"This SD Card was a great buy. High capacity, high reliability, and affordably priced. I did think the packaging for delivery was excessive for such a small item, but it was delivered in factory condition."
3,Transcend 4GB sdhc memory card,"Good product, but suited to my digital Kodak Camera only seems to take up to 2GB sdcard. The card is ok for other applications."
5,Fast data transfer and good value!,"The capacity means I can take tons of 10mp shots and HD videos without switching cards or dumping to laptop. With multiple kids in sports and constantly needing to take a lot of video, this card has stored everything I have taken over many events and many files. The data transfer is fast and the data capture is accurate with no issues to date. Highly recommend this card."
4,Nice,"I did not want to wipe off my other memory card, so I ordered another one and stored the first one."
1,Card is dead after just a few uses,"The tiny media cards arrived in a huge box... so much for the environment. But more disappointing, one of the media cards is completely dead after just a few uses. I bought these to be used in a Canon digital SLR and a Dell PC laptop. One media card is completely dead and can't be read/formatted by either the camera or the PC. A quick internet search seems to indicate a similar problem with the Transcend cards for other users. Buyer beware."
1,Lost my pictures,"After a few days of use with my Nikon CoolPix S3000, this card suddenly stopped being readable and lost several days worth of pictures. Do not buy."
4,Provides the Needed Memory for our Canon Camera,I ordered the 16GB instead of the 32GB because I could not imagine a time when 32GBs would be needed in my camera. So far it has worked well and its capacity has not been challenged. It has been formatted by the camera per the manufacturer's instructions and has functioned perfectly.When one considers I'm replacing a 1GB disk the 16GBs are an abundant luxury; I'm still amazed at the technological progress.
1,Not reliable card...stopped working after 1 and 1/2 year,This card isn't reliable......i lost all my pictures after the card couldn't be read by my camera and my laptop. It wouldn't let me format it either.....don't buy this product...i am speaking from my experience
5,Works great. Great price.,"Works great. Great price.However, if you use a card reader (as I do), it needs to have SDHC support. My old reader couldn't read this card; I had to transfer with a cable from the camera to the computer."
1,Poor Memory,"I bought a Transcend 4 GB memory card and it is defective. You might consider buying your memory cards locally since it really doesn't pay to mail it back then have them mail you one again. UPDATE: Amazon stepped up and did the right thing. I really appreciate the service Amazon provided. From now on, if Amazon and another company have the same item, I will purchase from Amazon-even if it is little more expensive."
4,"Great deal, bad packaging","Works great in my Nikon D-80. Very fast as far as I can tell (faster than the speed I shoot photos at least). Would have been nice if it came with plastic protective case to fit into my photo bag (just comes in small clamshell that is hard to open - you need scissors to open). It would be nice if manufacturers got rid of clamshells for internet sales. No shrink issues on line, so all this packaging does is annoy customers."
4,Good,It arrives in three days. But the card is a little slow when I modify the picture on the caramera.
2,SDHC Card,This is the first time I have used these cards they worked well for a small wedding the big question is how well will they work in the long run???? I did hook them up to a card reader and low and behold one of the cards was not showing up. I tried like 4 times and it finally showed up on the computer and all of the files were on the disc but the fact it took me so many tries to get it to down load was a big deal breaker.
1,Worse than a waste of money,"I bought this card to take on my 15-day Yucatan vacation. I shot about 300 photos. When I got home and inserted the card into my card reader, Windows Explorer recognized the full range of photos. I selected all to copy, and after copying about 3 photos there was a pop-up saying the drive was empty. Go back and look at the drive in Explorer, it looks empty. The only way I could get those photos off the card and onto my PC was to copy 3 at a time, put the card back in the camera, delete those 3 from the card in the camera, upload the next 3. I eventually got all my photos, but that was NOT a fun project.The card is now in the electronic waste pile."
5,Great card at a great price,"Prior to Christmas I found this card on [...] for [...] and it had so many great reviews, I bought three of them. When my hubby presented me with a new digital camera for Christmas (Canon SD880)which came with only a 32mb card, I was thrilled to have these 8gb cards on standby. Initially I got a memory card error but after reading the manual and formatting the card in the camera, it began to work immediately. After setting the camera to the continuous shoot mode, I was really amazed at how fast the card performed. As soon as I snapped a shot, I was able to snap immediately afterwards no beeping, buzzing or waiting. The Transcend card also did well when shooting in movie mode with my camera. I came here to price the 16gb card for my Camcorder, I cannot wait to see how great this card will be for recording as well."
2,Just worked for two months... :(,"It worked as advertised... for 8 weeks.Then it just broke. I have tried formatting it from Windows, Mac Os, Linux, using fdisk, using cameras, using gadgets, and nothing.Just stopped working..."
1,I didn't realize that my PC was not compatible with SD HC,I bought this thinking I could use it with my digital photo frame but I cannot load photos on it because my neither my pc (2 years old) or my sd card reader are compatible with SD HC. I went to Frys to try to get a newer SD card reader but they advised me that none of the card readers say on the packaging that they are compatible - this may mean that they work or they might not. I therefore had to send this back and settle for a regular 2 GB SD card.However... This was shipped to me very quickly and it was ultimately my mistake for not realizing this was not an SD card that I was used to.
4,Fine product,"While I worried at first about not buying a ""name brand"" item, this is still kicking 2 years later. I've filled it up and reformatted it several times and had no problems. I've moved it from one camera to another waterproof one also, and had no trouble reformatting it each time."
2,Was good for awhile...Then it failed.,"Used for awhile, but very much. Then one day it just stopped working with no solution to recover anything. It was a good deal at the time I guess, but caution."
4,SD worth it,Great price for the storage amount. Bought for point and shoot camera and it was well worth it
1,Failed within a week,"I got this card, together with the Canon Rebel Tsi, for my son who traveled to Chile. Within a week the card was unreadable in the camera and in the SD slot of his new Mac Book Pro. Can not x-change from a long distance."
1,Lost all of my photos on the card...,"We bought this card to use for a trip so we wouldn't have to use 4 different memory cards and the capacity suited us well for the trip. The problem came about when I tried to get photos off of the memory card and successfully got 30 or so pictures off before I started getting an error message and I couldn't copy my photos to my computer. I took the card out of my computer and re-inserted to fix the problem and when I opened the file, all of our photos were gone! I ended up having to pay another $40 for a program to get the pictures back. This will be going in the trash can and I'll be going back to Sandisk cards from now on."
1,"""memory card error"" is not the message I want my camera to give","I was on a mission trip in Nicaragua. The first day I used about 3 GB of the 16 this card was supposed to have. On the second day I was out in the countryside no electronics store for an hour in any direction, and my camera flashes, ""Memory card error"" across the display. I was stuck at the launch of this great and exciting mission without the ability to record any images or movies with my new camera.At the end of the day we returned to a city where I found a shop that sold 2GB memory cards. I put it in and it worked fine.This is a clear error on the part of this Transcend SD card. I paid the extra money for a 16GB card because I didn't want to mess with several smaller cards. My loss. I will not buy another Transcend product."
5,Great SDHC card - fast speed,"This is definitely fast enough for the Canon SD camera I use with it. The pictures transfer over to the card very fast and it holds a ton of images at 8GB. I've used Sandisk, Kingston, and all the higher end ""models"", but this Class 6 ranks right up there with all the others - at a fraction of the cost."
1,Did not work correctly from day 1!!!,"I purchased this memory card to use with my Canon T1i. I formatted the card as soon as I put it in my camera and began using. The video portion I would try to playback would freeze, and only the sound would be heard. Also I would sporatically get ""Cannot display image"" on pictures that I have previously viewed. I would love to be able to trust this brand again because of the price, but cannot, and will never purchase this brand again!"
3,My older computers can't read it.,"This is a great memory card, but I can't get my desktop and laptop that were purchased in '06 and '07 to read it. Only the one purchased in '09 can read it. Maybe I just need to update my software, but I haven't had this problem with other SD cards..."
1,Low quality when compared to other SDHC cards,"Photos appeared in less quality when you store them on this Card. I could see the difference since I also use Kingston cards for taking pictures. When compare prices, this one is cheaper and may be that is the main topic; cheap price low quality"
3,Transcend 8 GB SDHC,Nice capacity. Only after a long time of using it I can say how robust is this memory card.
5,Surpassed my expectation,"I only had this card for about one month when I left it in my shirt pocket and forgot it there. It went through the wash ! I was horrified because I had quite a bit of family photos on it ! I dried it off ,prayed and tried it on my Canon Rebel ! It worked ! Five months later it still works ! No problems !"
4,It works on my camera...,I got this for my friend and for some reason it didnt work on his camera. Not sure if he knew what he was doing. I switched with him and now i use this memory card. Works fine for me.
4,Compared To My SanDisk 8GB Extreme SDHC Class 10,"The Transcend class 6 card seems to work about as well as my SanDisk Extreme SDHC Class 10 card.I don't see much, if any, difference in performance."
5,GREAT buy for GOOD memory!,"I bought a SONY NEX C3 and it has HD quality pictures and videos! So i started searching about the best brand and OF COURSE Transcend is published to be ONE OF THE BEST! Great reputation! Then with quality pictures and videos they say Class 6 and up should be used. Well, i don't know why but Class 10 seems to have reviews that it causes problems than using a Class 6 and good thing that Class 6 is much cheaper than 10 of course. So to sum it up, i got two Transcend SD memory Class 16 and i'm very happy that it does works well! GO GRAB ONE or TWO OR MOREEEEE!"
5,Memory chip,"This product arrived very quickly, and is in very good condition. The chip is working very well, and I really enjoy it. I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you."
4,Overall very satisfied,"The 8GB memory was reasonably priced and fit my needs perfectly (primary use was in a Garmin GPS), though wanted to also use as a memory storage. My only concern was that when I put it in a USB removable memory drive, it wouldn't boot up. Though not as convenient, I was able to work aroung this bump. Overall, I was very satisfied."
5,I don't have to think about it,"A flash memory card should just work, and always work. That's what this has done for me over the last year and a half. I chose this size because it could be easily backed up to one blank DVD, and two 4GB cards gives me redundancy over 1 8GB card. I use it in a Canon SLR, and sometimes in a portable card reader or a built-in reader on a computer. I have had no issues of any kind. Money well spent."
1,Seriously?,"I've ordered from this company twice, and two times in a row they've sent the wrong product to me. I have little interest waiting for another week to see if they can send the right card to me. Will never do business with them again."
1,Failed within one month of use,"Used this card with my Canon T1i and had generally pleasing performance. Unfortunately the card failed after about a month of use (about 1600 photos). I lost images taken from a 2 hour hike as a result. I tried a number of recovery programs - but simply will not work, the card is totally toast. While doing research to find how to recover my files I read on a number of sites about this card failing - wish I had researched more before I bought it."
1,Shipping was so slow!!,"I bought this product about a week and a half or two weeks ago and it still has not come! It is past the day they said would be the latest possible day for delivery, but still no show! I am very disappointed."
2,Barely qualifies as class 6,"I purchased this card because I take a number of speed shots and, while my camera can hold them in memory for a period of time until they are written to disk, I periodically fill that memory as well. As a result I wanted to get a fast card compatible with my camera. The specs for class 4 memory cards go up to 15MB per second, while the ones for 6 cards go up to 20MBps. The packaging claims 16MBps meaning that this only barely gets into the class 6 range. This would be more than adequate for most things, but when I am taking pictures of my daughter's rugby team in sport mode, I want them to be written to the card as fast as possible, I know that the card speed is just one of a number of things that go into the actual write speed, but this is the one that I can easily change. Like I said, for most things, this card would be perfectly acceptable and the price is pretty good. It just wasn't what I wanted/needed."
5,Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6,So far this memory card has been reliable used in my Zoom H4n handy recorder.
5,Memory for Dummies,"- It's big (8Gb, that's more pictures you would have taken in a lifetime of film).- It's fast (you can make HD movies with it).- It's cheap (32 bucks, how much is your camera?)- It works (duh),==> So buy it, Dummy. I bought it too."
1,This Product does work in Eee XP environment.,I was able to get a download hotfix from MS that corrected the XP problem with recognizing the Transcend 8G SDHC card and it is now working just fine in my XP based Eee. I'm a happy guy. The issue all along was not the Transcend card but XP support for any SDHC larger than 4G. Now I can't change the number of stars for this product or publish a new review. I will give it 5 stars.
5,"Great Card, Great Price!!",This card is definitely worth the purchase. I'm currently using it on my Kodak z1015is and the picture quality and HD video quality are captured and stored in high quality format. A must have for anyone that wants to display great pictures.
1,Data loss,After two months of use I noticed severe data loss.. pictures from my vacation became unreadable. I thought it was just a one-off but so I formatted the card (in my camera) and used it again. Low and behold.. same thing. Some pictures became unreadable and lost again.Wouldn't go with Transcend ever again.. I'm going with Kingston.
1,transcend 8 gb sd card,i ordered an 8gb card but recieved in the mail a 4gb card since i needed it right away i opened it and used itI really wish i had recieved this item correctly the first time and am very tired of the shippers making these stupid mistakes and I will not give them the opportunity to make it betterMaybe they can get it right the first time
3,good,"I recently bought this item together with the canon HF100. The packaging for the item is crazily humongous for an item so tiny. It was twice the size the packaging for the cam. As an overseas buyer, frieight was calculated on volumetric weight, ie space that it took up in a cargo. The freight is twice that of the cam! item is ok, packaging makes it expensive"
4,So far so good...no problems at all..working as expected,"Very satisfied with this product. I am using it with my Canon SX 200 IS. The reason I went for this product is, my camera has HD video capability and I definitely need high speeds of Read/Write. This memory card is Class 6.Satisfied with this product. Using it for last 3 months. I formatted it using my camera several times before every trip. No problems at all."
2,Failed after a few days,"It was nice while it lasted, but it failed after a few days. Neither of my two computers will read the card any longer. I'm not sure if this is an isolated case or if this points to other quality control issues, see other reviews to see if there is any pattern on defective units."
4,Just in Time,"I ordered this in preparation or a site seeing trip in the south west. Like an idiot, i ordered it only a few days before I would leave, but luckily it got here about 20 mins before I walked out the door. Anyways, it works great and allows me to take all the photos I want while I'm gone. Others have said it before and I'm going to say it again: make sure that your device can use SDHC cards before purchasing."
1,Watch for Electric Shock!,"I used this bottle warmer for 1 day, right after we brought our son home from the hospital. I read the directions, it wasn't too difficult so I know I used it right! I actually got shocked several times by this bottle warmer. I would go to grab the bottle and would get shocked everytime! I would recommend looking elsewhere, thank goodness I wasn't holding my son when this happened!"
1,Not worth it.,"I registered for this after hearing that it wasn't safe to microwave baby's formula. After using it a few times, I was really disappointed-it took forever to heat the formula and I was shocked once. It doesn't have an on/off switch and the water inside will collect and turn brown. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,I hate this product,You could only use certain kinds of bottles and it takes for ever to heat the milk. I am going to return this bottle warmer I have no use for it.
1,Blah! Worthless,This thing takes FOREVER to heat up and left hotspots in the bottle. Youd be better off nuking some water in a deep bowl and warming the bottle in it. Save your money.
1,I Can't Believe I Just Paid $5.95 for a Junior High Book Review,"I am so pissed at myself for wasting six dollars on this ridiculous ""article."" Don't buy it!!! I had to assign at least one star to move on from this screen. ZERO stars."
5,Steaming Groove,"I too bought this on a whim because it was a Perfecto. Perfecto it is!You know how they say you should cook a lobster over a low flame and gradually raise the temperature? Cattaneo sets out to cook you the same way. Deep, dark, steamy, smooth and sexy, the rhythms of this double set are delightfully hypnotic. While the second of the two discs is where the main action is, the first disc sets you up nice and slow, and you get really cooking on the second. It's a good set-up and a great buy. I believe that Deep Dish's, ""Moscow,"" is a great companion album to this one."
1,What do you expect from Perfecto,"One star is very generous in my opinion. The first couple of songs sound great. Progressive and dark. It sounded promising. Then as we progressed further into the cd, Hernan Cattaneo shifted toward flamey mainstream music. Save your money."
4,No place like Hell-for-Certain,This book has many tales in it. Some are a lot better then others. The Big reason I purchased this book is because I live on Hell-For-Certain and I wanted to see what this book had to offer.
2,just ok,"I have what they call K-9 grass and thought it would be good for picking up all the tree droppings on it. Well it doesnt work as good as I thought it would. Its like cutting the grass, hard to push and have to keep going over it and over it. Does OK on flat surfaces but again such a small pick up area it takes forever....would return it if it didnt cost so much to do so...I just hope I find another use for it...."
3,SpinSweep review,I like the idea of the SpinSweep but it's not as easy as I had expected. Maybe it's because my driveway isn't flat. It has many cracks. It works well on the more even parts. I wish it was less expensive.
2,IT OK!!!,"I clean parking lots for a living. I found out it does not do well when their is a lot of paper. The paper gets stuck between the wheel and the frame. which is trying sometimes when you have to stop an take the paper out. it does well on leafs which i encounter a lot but sometimes the leafs even comes out the sides. It comes in handy sometimes for the light work i do with it. perfect for cups,cans,and bottles. If bottles are full it will not fit but if empty it goes right in. I use it twice a day. This may be a bit much for it. once a week is idea for it."
4,Gift Item of Hoover L1405 Spin Sweep Pro Outdoor Sweeper,"I own one of this product and sent one to my son-in-law. I really like ours. It's not perfect, but it makes a dusty, messy, pollen/allergen laden job much less so. I rate it at least 4 stars for its simplicity of action, its lightness and maneuverability. Our patio is a great deal easier to maintain and our daughter tells us that her husband finds it quite a nifty thing for cleaning their walk of tree droppings and mowed grass. I think is is well worth owning if one has any large expanse of pavement to clean.It does it quickly and with little physical effort. Not too heavy for my wife to use either. Actually I rate it 4 + + + stars. Rarely is anything 5 stars with me."
5,Awesome Tool to have!!!!!,We really love this outdoor sweeper. It worked better than I had expected! I was so surprised how clean our driveway looked after using it. You don't realize all the pieces of dirt and little pebbles that are all over. I give it 5 stars. Everyone who saw it couldn't understand that it uses no power...You just push it and it works. It's nice to have no cords or gas to worry about!It's very green and keeps your property looking great!
3,It'[s Ok,"When I received this I went out to my back patio and tried it. Took a couple of passes and was working great. Then the right wheel kept jamming. I took a closer look and the retaining clip that keeps the wheel on came off. Looking around I found the clip and repaired it.I bought this thinking it would clean up the pine needles, leaves and dirt that is blown onto my back patio. It does a great job at cleaning up the pine needles and leaves. As for the dirt, it picks up most of it and leaves a line of dirt. You go back to clean up the remaining dirt and the line moves to where ever the center is.If you have big things to clean up it is great. But don't expect it to pick up all the dirt. This was a lot of money for only picking up the bigger things. I should of just stuck with my rake and broom."
2,Only lasted about 1.5 months,"It fits and works well when you first get it, but it stopped wicking after about a month and a half."
1,No Good!,Something is very wrong with these Holmes humidifier wicks. In the past Ive been able to get through the winter with three wicks. And that was using VERY hard water. Those wicks simply got full of minerals and stopped working.Not a problem at all. The last two wicks I ordered from Amazon only lasted a couple of days and then just stopped wicking. One week tops is all you get from them. And these are not cheap. I think I shall write to Holmes and complain. Did Holmes forget how to make wicks? This is intolerable!
3,"Works well, but only lasted 2.5 weeks","I didn't use the humidifier for about four years, and then finally got got around to buying a this filter so I could use it again. I was initially very happy with it. I thought that the Amazon.com review that said it needed to be replaced every 4-8 weeks depending on water quality was probably setting people up so that when it lasted a few months, they would be happy it lasted so long! Unfortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth. This filter lasted only 2.5 weeks. I received it December 15, and by January 1 I noticed the water tanks weren't emptying much anymore, and the humidity had dropped down significantly in the house. I realize that we just probably have very hard water in Phoenix, but I doubt it's much better most places, so saying it will last 4-8 weeks is definitely misleading. At $15 for this filter, that works out to almost a dollar a day."
5,Holmes Filter,"Good product, will order again.The dogs competed against each other, not only for best dressed, but also for best dancer. And after a long night on the dance floor, party trays filled with dog biscuits were set out for the hungry."
5,Life Changing!,"Apples & Pears has changed my life! I approach food, exercise and health in a new and positive light after reading this book. My eating habits have changed and I have lost weight, but more importantly, I understand for the first time, why and how I have had difficulties in the past losing and keeping weight off. With the insights and well researched wealth of information offered in Dr. Savard's book, I am eating and exercising with a better understanding of how my activities and choices affect my health and well-being. It has also changed how I counsel others -- friends and family members -- about their own eating and exercise habits. Thank you, Dr. Savard! Your book has changed my life -- I feel positive and in control with the understanding and insights I have gained!"
4,the missing link....,"i love this attachment ...have the original wavemaster...in the beginning, it slipped a bit, but with adjustment it's fine...makes the bag workout complete...."
3,My Least favorite WoW Action Figure,"In the pictures for this product, the action figure looks like she will fit nicely with the others. Really neat pose, awesomely detailed weapons, and very visually stunning.Overall, the figure received was what is in the photos. However, the weapon broke not too long into ownership, and this figure does not stand very well on it's own. I usually have to balance it by leaning it up against other figures to keep it upright.It's possible that a later run of this figure fixed some of these issues, but when I purchased this 5 years ago, I was a little disappointed in the wake of the other excellent figures."
3,I Copied My Daughter In Law in Cookbook Taste,"My daughter in law had this cookbook on her Christmas list along with some of the other Moosewood Inn cookbooks. When we went to their house to visit, I browsed through this particular one and found some really good recipes and decided to order one for myself. I wasn't disappointed in most of the ideas but some I know my husband wouldn't care for!"
4,Great Meals for Harried Families,"I'm lovin' this book! My goal has been to move my family toward 3 meatless meals every week, and this book is helping greatly. Of course, I still have to PLAN what to eat, and actually MAKE it, but that's MY problem..."
5,One of my favorites,This is one of the easier of the Moosewood series and one of my favorites. Provides some nice flavor combinations I would not have put together on my own.
3,No Noticable HP Gains,"This air filter is only good in the case that it fits the OEM intake system and is washable. There are no horsepower gains that I can feel. You're probably better off saving an extra $100 or so for an AEM or Injen intake system. More power gains and I believe the filters are still also washable. Cold air intakes however, are more expensive. You may even need to buy a bypass valve to make sure it doesn't suck in water when it rains/floods."
1,Did not work,"I bought this at Best Buy 2 weeks ago for $29. It looked like the perfect product doing everything I wanted. It did not work, never recognized my IPOD. No customer support. No instructions given. User interface not clear. I do not recommend this product. I am still looking for a good software to back up my Ipod."
2,Not what I expected,"For some reason I expected these cases to be thin cases of standard height (5"") and width (6"") with a transparent front lid. What I wanted is made by Verbatim (and I suppose others). I recently ordered and received the Verbatim cases but two out of three I tried broke at the hinges when I opened them. This is probably lot related but I sent them back and looked for a similar item. Some reviews mention the problem too.I like to affix full-face glossy inkjet printed labels to my DVDs, won't work in these Memorex cases. And I don't like the size (6"" X 7""). The cases do have a place to slide a label in both front and rear but didn't appeal to me. Looks tough to slide an inkjet glossy label into the pouch.I'd return these cases but it's hardly worth the hassle even though Amazon makes it very easy and the goof was mine."
5,Memorex Cool Color Slim DVD Storage Cases,"I love these cases. I bought the multicolor pack and the clear pack. I have a very limited space for my DVDs and was in need of space saving, so when I found these I was ecstatic. Two of these cases equals one original case. The great thing is that it has a plastic outer sleeve so you can take the cover out of the old one and insert it into the new case. I do have to trim it a little (about 1/4 of an inch) but it is worth it.Though I did not originally buy this item here the store I did buy them from no longer supply so I have a set ready in my shopping cart for when I do need them, which should be soon because I have found a few loose DVDs that have come with some of my CDs (that I have also consolidated)."
1,Poorly Written,"Much of the content in this book is covered multiple times. I found the writting style to be very difficult to follow without high concentration on the text (more difficult than other technical books). It seems as though the technical concepts are not completely understood by the author as their explainations in this book are as dry as RFC's. I chose this book because I have used Exam Preps in the past and had good luck with them, but this one is bad... very bad."
4,"Very, Very Good Disc","Great music, with only one problem. The Disc is missing one song, ""The Race"" by Yello. Otherwise, the choice of music in the movie is great, which creates for a great cd."
2,A little hard to read,"I thought that this book was geared towards the academic crowd rather than people actually going through a divorce.I am not up on my statistics, so some of the stuff was a bit over my head."
2,"The book had gorgeous photos, but I found the advice to be a bit simplistic","While there is no question that Richard I'Anson is a wonderful photographer and has gotten some great shots, I think the overall quality of the advice in the book could have been better. Granted he probably doesn't want people copying his technique, but I still felt the book was a bit lacking.What was very useful, however, was his detailed settings and material information so that the reader would have a step in the direction of where to start. If this book is revised in the future I'd like to see more tips and less technical information."
2,Only use this product if you need a 1 week fix.,"A human can't get an exhaust manifold clean enough for this product to properly bond.Before applying: Stir this stuff like your life depends on it.After 1 hour of brushing with a steel brush and properly prepping the surface near the crack, I applied the entire 3 oz contents.Let the material rest for a long while before starting the motor, otherwise, this product will rise like a bread in the oven upon starting your motor. I had to apply this stuff twice because of that. Ran great for 1 week. After 1 week, the product liberated itself from my manifold.Regardless, this is strictly a temporary fix that could get you out of the mountains/dessert to where you can fix your car properly later."
3,Primo emo,"3 1/2Despite a slightly stronger sister album, there is plenty on the short eight tracks worth checking out, with a serviceable bonus EP attached. The vocals can be hit and miss, and we do catch this frontman out of his element at times, but the majority of soothing rock recalls early R.E.M. and the cover songs actually have something to say."
3,a little disappointing,"After reading the other reviews I was very exceited to get this CD. However, I had none of the experiences others noted. In fact, I found some of the vocals very depressing - wailing sounds of someone in a lot of emotional pain. The last song is good, and that is why I gave it 3 stars. The last song has what I believe are whale sounds and good vibrational tones to which my body responded."
3,VINYL,"I HAVE THIS ON VINYL,I HAVE HAD THIS ALBUM SINCE IT CAME OUT,NOT THE M.T.B.WERE ALL USED TO,A PRETTY GOOD LISTEN,MELLOWISH TOO."
5,"Wonderful, life-changing book!","Highly recommended. Not only is Jesus our Lord and Savior, He is also a parenting partner who will help and guide us every step of the way. Whitehurst helps us attain a working understanding of this partnership to revolutionize our parenting. Wonderful book which totally changed my outlook on parenting."
4,Great product for allergy sufferers,"We bought this purifier for our 2 year-old daughter about 3 months ago. She has terrible allergies and is always congested in the morning. Since we started using the fan in her room every night, no more stuffy noses and coughing in the morning. Plus, the noise of the fan keeps her sleeping longer! It is the perfect size and we often move it into other rooms during the day to freshen them up. We will probably purchase another in the spring for our allergies. The only down side is replacing two filters, but an investment worthwhile and cheaper than cough medicine."
2,Placebo?,"I was sick of waking up every morning with red eyes and a stuffy nose, but I didn't want to dump a lot of money into an air purifier I wasn't sure would work (some of the similar looking purifiers out there cost $200-$300). So needless to say, cost was a factor in my choice of this Holmes purifier. And...I guess it's working (?). I left it on in my bedroom all day every day for about a month, and I sometimes wake up feeling less congested, but mostly I feel the same, so I can't tell if it's some sort of placebo thing. If you're looking for something that's going markedly alleviate your allergies, don't bother with this one (I can't speak for other companies/models). But it does seem to help a little."
1,2 defective products from the seller,"This was purchased and then sent back as defective at my expense. The replacement was also defective. I am now working with Motorola's warranty department and going on a month without . To their credit, Amazon assisted in the replacement."
2,Too weird for me,"I can't believe I wasted time reading 100+ pages of this book before giving in. The first page should have been warning enough! Having adored Captain Correlli's Mandolin I plodded on in the hope of enlighthenment but eventually I had had enough. I found the use of what I presume to be Spanish or Portuguese phrases, and spirits very tough. I gather this book follows on from another - maybe I should have read that first.I think the subject matter is interesting but it was too surreal for me to enjoy. I'm sure it is a great book, but it was harder work than I was willing to endure."
3,Senior Louis De Bernieres is loco,"It's shocking, it's crazy, it's full of imagination, sometimes it scared me.DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE PREVIOUS BOOK.Was he munching coca when he wrote this."
3,Not the Same Merino,"Let me start by saying that I am huge fan of Smartwool products. I've been changing my sock drawer to all-Smartwool all the time. I was initially disappointed with the glove liners, though. They don't actually itch or scratch, but they feel rough enough to suggest itching and scratching. Maybe it's the guage of the knit -- 10 stitches to the inch. I'm not going to count the stitches per inch in the socks, but I'd guess the guage is twice as fine. The gloves are, however, warm, just like you'd want a glove liner to be."
2,Not impressed,"Pills very easily, warm as long as there is no wind or water. If you have any wind or water at all, be prepared to freeze your fingers."
3,Cute but not warm,"I got the wisteria and i love them, they're cute. I live in PA, so there's winter here, though not as much as other places. I find them thin and am constantly cold... but they do FEEL great. I LOVE the socks, and these FEEL like a sock for your hands!!"
3,My First Exposure...,"I did the Dean Wareham thing backwards. I started with Luna and figured I couldn't go wrong with Galaxie because I LOVE Luna. However, the style of Galaxie is different. The lyrics weren't quite as clever, and the tunes weren't as satisfying as any of the Luna stuff I have (expect perhaps Pup Tent). However, I do have the distinct feeling that Galaxie is music that grows on you. If you're a Luna fan, give Galaxie a spin, but don't expect instant gratification."
3,Just OK,"Farewell was recorded in Europe in 1993.It is a straight-ahead jazz quartet, playing mostly originals and most of those are John's. He was working a lot with LaVerne at this time.Though I've long been a fan of John Abercrombie, this is the first I've heard him working with Andy LaVern. They clearly have a rapport, a deep understanding of the music and a desire to explore ideas. But for me it all comes off as a bit too tame and too academic. Which is not to say it is poor or unlistenable. There is some gorgeous music (George Mraz' bass may be the unsuspected highlight of the CD). It's a pleasant, intelligent dialog that lacks excitement (even when up tempo) and the feeling of being in the moment.""Farewell"" was recorded about the same time as Abercrombie's ""November"" release on ECM and I much prefer his work there for the more open feeling of the recording and the group dynamic. I suspect, though, that if you favor piano-jazz, or Andy LaVerne, you may enjoy ""Farewell"" more."
3,F-15 Eagle: A Photo Chronicle,"Although a little out of date, this is a well-researched history of the F-15 and variants. There are lots of large full-color photos and an excellent section on special, test, and NASA Eagles. Since it was published in '94 there have been a few changes and additions to the Eagle fleet, but overall a good addition to any aviation enthusiast's collection."
1,"98% rind, 2% rind of rind","Pathetic.Never trying this cheese before, I didn't write about it, but this weekend had a chance to try the real thing and it was excellent!This... pathetic.I actually threw it away."
5,a cool breeze or a heavy wind?,"I've had this album for over three years now and I've always thought that it was a pretty lackluster effort. The songs don't really flow and there really doesn't appear to be much focus, but the more I listened to it the more I came to really appreciate its beauty. The album is very melancholic, very sparse and real. When listened to in the appropriate mood it can be very powerful. Without a doubt it's one of the deepest albums I own. ""Drop"" is one of my favorite songs"
4,One Deep Album,Ocean Beach took me a number of play throughs to catch on to it. But now that I have gone rounds with this album I have realized that it has been quite a long time since I have taken it out of my car collection.
2,Not so hot,"I bought this for my wife, who absolutely hates chopping up onions. The bottom tends to fall off, sending chunks of onions all over the place. Also, the blades might not be sharp enough, because a lot of the onion pieces are not cut all the way through. I end up having to come in and slice everything up by hand, so this gadget is going to end up in our 'wasted money' pile in our basement."
1,More of the same,"Anderson's books are not very good as a textbook, but would be better as a reviewer. There's more formulas than you can shake a stick at (Chapter 3 has over 150 formulas). There's not too much explaining at all, and you're struggling to find what various symbols mean. It's not a useful tool at all."
1,mix magazine subscription,"Ordered the magazine one year at Christmas for my son came without a hitch, second year did a renewal and change of address, and the magazine never came, contacted amazon and was informed that the order was canceled and I was to get a refund which I did pretty promptly but I really would have liked the magazine for my son. I will think twice about ordering another magazine of any type from amazon. i love amazon but the magazine section needs work."
1,Don't buy magazines from Amazon,I'll never buy a magazine from Amazon again.*They* cancelled the order and did not notify me.
4,"Highest setting a bit loud, otherwise good","I have several of these and like them as much for white noise as for dust. The newest addition has a much louder sound and is a bit annoying to just leave running in a room for dust, and a bit too loud to sleep with. The middle setting obviously isn't going to suck up as much dust, and is a bit too quiet to cover up noise while sleeping. It is just all together a bit more clunky sounding then my older ones in the same model."
1,very disappointing,"I bought this purifier for the room that my cats' litter boxes are in. I was buying a replacement for a purifier I had which got lost in a move, and the model I had previously bought is no longer made. I wanted a model that was small (I live in a one bedroom apartment), quiet, and can keep the dust from the litter boxes under control. I've owned this one 6 months and while it started off quiet it no longer is. Not only is it loud but the loudness isn't constant; instead of a constant whirring it sounds more like whirwhirwhir. Also, and most importantly, everything in that room stinks like dust. I essentially threw money buying this one; I am now shopping for a new purifier."
2,Cleaning Suggestion,"I dont have this model, but I have a larger Holmes Air purifier, and agree with the other reviews - they get themselves very dirty very quickly. I have found though, that if you put the front cover (the part hardest to clean) in the dishwasher & run it on a light cycle, it comes out perfect. Wiping the rest down with a cleaning cloth does the job as well. I wouldn't recommending buying a Holmes product, btu if you already have one, hopefully this cleaning tip will help."
2,An unremarkable gamebook...,"As far as ""Choose your own adventure"" books go, this was so-so to me:---Characters---I didn't like how the characters Matt and Milma were not very well developed, thus making me not care about going on an adventure with them. I don't think it would have mattered if they were with the reader or not.Haven was decently developed.---Artwork---Horrible. Painful to look at.---Story---Not horrible, but not great either. There wasn't a single scene that was memorable.---Conclusion---This is one book I doubt I will ever read again. At least for me, a book without a single memorable scene is not worth reading (unless I am big time bored)."
5,All around good book,"Words can't explain how good this book is if you suffer from pain. I work at a computer and must keep practising the exercises routinely. I took it out of the Queensbourogh Public Library first, then decided it is a must have. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon. LOVE...Sholom Leb"
5,You better recognize!,"In the stable of particularly formidable dance music talent known as Plastic City, Lexicon stands out as the most consistently energizing. It's hard to find a flaw in this album, and anyone who's looking for one isn't paying attention to the wash of tech-house funk spilling into their aural cavities. Accept no substitutes, Lexicon is it."
4,Lara is perfection!,"The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the audience. Even though it was amazing to watch the audience sing ""Je T'aime"" and parts of other songs, I bought this DVD to watch Lara, not the audience :)When Lara sings, she is the song. There's no other way describe her performance. If you are a fan of Lara you won't be disappointed with this DVD. The singing audience will only be a minor distraction."
5,LARA FABIAN,"há muito queria este Dvd, agradeo muito a vcs pelo servio, é realmente um show para ser visto e revisto muitas vezes, Lara como sempre MARAVILHOSA.Espero um dia poder ter o privilégio de poder assistir a um show dela, se possível em uma gravao de um novo DVD, e poder dizer ""Eu participei deste espetáculo"" Lara Merci Beaucoup!!"
1,Frustrating,"Well, Amazon sent me a second copy of Laura Fabian Live, and that one didnt work on either one of my VCR's. I had no problem receiving or returning either DVD. Just too bad I couldnt see it. By the way I did pay full price. I remember being in Italy, and buying a DVD, and being told it needed to be changed, so it could play Stateside. I took it to a shop that does that (I have no idea what that did) but it took awhile. It wouldnt work on a VCR at a persons home in Italy but worked like a dream when I returned home. So I need to agree with Steven M. There are two versions for playing Europian DVD's."
4,Nice rice cooker little slow in cooking though,Its a nice cooker. I did not realize it takes so long to cook. I had a Black & Decker 8 cups cooker which used to cook very fast. Now I have to start the rice cooker before I make any other side or entree. That is why gave it a 4. It does cook rice very well - soft and fluffy. Would recommend it :)
3,"Love the cooker, hate the pot...","I just bought my second replacement pot for this (my wife's) rice cooker - the non-stick scratches if you look at it sideways, and she worries about chemicals leaching into the rice. I think the culprit is a small metal stand grandma keeps using for steaming. Don't get me wrong, the cooker itself works great for many things beyond rice, but for an original $300+ purchase price you'd think the non-stick coating would be tougher - it looks like the first generation Teflon I remember on the original 70's non-stick pans ..."
1,It was a great unit while it worked,"I purchased it in January 2011. The cooker has been used 2-4 times a week for the past 16 months. Everything worked great until this morning. The unit would not power up (the display still worked). A board needs to be replaced, and warranty is only 1 year.So, the cost came to be about 16 dollars a month. I am now waiting to hear about the cost of the new board."
2,Two times too much,"Jim Harrison, in a promo blurb, says that the introduction alone is worth the price of the book. Close but not quite right. The introduction is the best part of the book. That and the picture on the book cover. This book is a collection of previously published essays and magazine stories. Two times too much for most of them. A mundane, wordy chronicle of action sports and poetry by a dilettante who is forever quoting his poet soul brother, rainer maria rilke, another dabbler who perfected the art of guesting and frivolous flitting about under the guise of meaningful experience. This book has nothing new to say. Second hand and second rate."
5,Rising Sun,"This book kept me glued to the page. A gripping account of a teenager stuck in a concentration camp without having done anything wrong. A surprising lack of rancor, the author gives a picture of the good and bad in the people on both sides of the conflict. Also unusual are the admissions of less than perfect actions on his own part. It almost made me feel like I had been there."
4,"Dig it, Assimilate it, Love it","Skinny Puppy are without a doubt one of the most important and influential bands of the so-called industrial genre. This collection stands as a testament to the collective creative genius of Skinny Puppy. The tracks on this compilation are among the band's best and most influential. However, if you're new to SP and you have only listened to this particular collection, don't be quick to assume that these are all necessarily their greatest songs. There are plenty more great tracks besides these which you can find on their many albums. From the pulverizing beats of Stairs and Flowers, Spasmolytic and Dig It, to the dark, danceable rythms of Assimilate and Smothered Hope, this CD has it all. Sit back, press play and brace yourself for an electronic onslaught. Dance music has never sounded so brutal as Skinny Puppy."
1,Simply poor,"Mr. Album has written a story that my teen-aged daughter would be ashamed to turn into English Composition class. This book is simplistic, poorly conceived, mindless, and trite. I think maybe the wisdom in ""Morrie"" was clearly and entirely ""Morrie's"" and Mr. Albom, apparently not much of a writer based on this hackneyed attempt, was a very lucky man to have been there to record Morrie's thoughts. I strongly recommend skipping this one unless you like to be bored pretty much out of your mind. I couldn't take it, even though it's a short book. I'll say one thing though. Hype obviously sells books. That's the only thing that must be selling this awful work. We shouldn't reward Mr. Albom for this. Let him write something good, then buy it but not before."
4,Very Quick and Enjoyable Read.,"This was a very good book. Very thought provoking. It was a quick and easy read, I read it in one day."
4,Five People Review,"The book The Five People you Meet in Heaven, by Mitch Albom, has to be one the most inspirational books I have ever read. The book starts at Eddie, the main characters death. Eddie is an old man whose life has been very rough. He worked at Ruby Pier, an ameusment park, as the maintenance manager all his life and hated it. In fact, he hated most of life after his family and loved ones passed away. But when Eddie dies and meets five people in Heaven who's lives he influenced, he sees his life differently. He realizes all the terrible things he had done or caused, and all the great things he had done for others. His life was not the disaster he had thought it had been, and this insight made him realize the things he took for granted.I strongly recommend this book for anyone over the age of 10 because of the strong influence it has on how you see yourself and other people."
4,Who's in Heaven,Interesting makes you wonder who are you going to meet in Heaven?From your pass to the present? who will you run into?
5,Best book I've ever read!,Awesome book. I've read it time and time again. I bought it for family and friends when it first came out. Makes you realize what kind of impact you can have in this world.
3,Nice quick read,"This little book put an interesting perspective on our overall place in the world. For those who like the thought that everything is connected, this is a good little tale. But I guess if you're reall introspective and questioning, this book leaves you wanting more answers than you'll ever get. And maybe that's the whole point."
3,A Feel Good Holiday Quick Read.,"Although a good story and a peek into what someone else thinks heaven might be, I found The Traveler's Gift a better more compelling story. They follow the same sort of story lines."
4,Charming,"Albom's wonderful little story carries you off into the life of an elderly amusement park worker. Colourful, emotional and deeply sweet, you'll find yourself wishing the story would go on and on."
5,Best Book,"It was soo good! I loved it. Captivating. Inspiring. Perfect. At times, it can be hard to fOllow, but by the end all of the pieces fit."
2,Disappointing,"'Five People You Meet in Heaven' is a disappointing book. The title itself suggests some interesting ideas about heaven. But the idea is a simple one; that could be covered by the first person the hero meets in Heaven. Making it five people is just a way to make a short story long. As an online short story it would live up to its expectations. As a long story, hard-cover book, it does not."
2,I don't get the high ratings...,"This book was a very simple, fast read. The concept interesting and the author had a nice literary style. This book lacked depth and emotional pull. My book club unanimously agreed that this book was ""okay"" and was missing something to make it truly spectacular. Not a bad read, but I would not read it again."
1,A real yawner,"I got this book as a gift and I know it was meant to be a good one and I dug right in until I couldn't take it anymore. The only thing I can figure is that the people sending in the five star reviews are with the publisher of this horrid little book. It simply does not measure up to all the hype. If you buy it, just be aware you are being sold a poor bill of goods. There's no story here and the writing is, well, lousy."
2,Terrible book,"This book has a nice beginning,but it gets nowhere,really.The writing is so sappy,and it gets way too cliche.It is actually a dull version of The Christmas Carol.The characters are one dimensional,and I don't really feel for Eddie.Okay we know he had a hard time at war,but why keep mulling over it?And his relationship with Mag was so unrealistic and trite.I am only 14 and I don't understand how adults could love this book.Let's face it,Mitch Albom's writing is amateur."
5,Mitch surprises me again,If you are looking for a great little book with no pretense - this is it. Its a very short read but it has lingered on my mind long after. I am not a devote believer in any particular afterlife yet still loved this book. It made me ponder...it made me feel good.
5,I Love this book.,I read this book some time ago. It cause me to purchase every book written by Mitch Albom. This is the second time I purchased this title as a gift.
4,A QUICK READ,"I HAVE RECENTLY JOINED A BOOK CLUB AND THIS BOOK WAS CHOSEN. IT WAS NOT A BOOK I WOULD OF CHOSEN TO READ, BUT WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE CHOICE. I KEEP THINKING OF THE 5 PEOPLE WHO I WILL MEET IN THE ""AFTER LIFE""."
3,Book vs. Movie,"I saw the film starring Jon Voight and was inspired to buy the book, assuming that the book would probably be better. I was surprised at how short the book was considering the length & intensity of the film. The book is basically short & sweet, and written more like a creative short story. I felt it didn't ""pack-the-punch"". For me, the message it bears is best expressed visually. I was happy to find out that the story is not quite as the title implies- such as the cliche meet Saint So & So at the""Pearly Gates"". As a Buddhist, I found it more in line with eastern thought and how we are all connected. My advise... buy the film for content, buy the book as a momento."
3,cover of book smudged,"I bought this book for my friend and have ordered many things through Amazon and have never had a problem. The book came quickly enough, but there was a grease smudge on the front bottom. when I carefully tried to gently rub it off, it rubbed off part of the cover and discolored it. I expected better quality. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if it was ordered for myself, but it was a gift."
2,Mediocre at best,This book is good for the simple minded reader. If you are looking for something that you must think about don't even buy into the hype of this book. The 5 People is riddled with cliches and predictability. I myself am into books that make me think and are unexpected. However this book did not even come close to my expectations. If you are simple minded you will love this book but if you are searching for something more like a book an author had to research and actually spend more than a week on avoid this read!!
1,Too sappy for my taste,I read this book at the recommendation of a friend. It was too sappy for me. I am not a fan of reflective literature and preferred high-action novels.
1,Sentimental drivel,"The only reason I kept reading this book was to see if it could possibly get any worse. The answer: it could and it did. It was poorly written, sappy, and dripping with nostalgia and cheesy, Hallmark-card sentimentality.Now I know why this book is sold in airports and supermarket checkout aisles."
2,Isn't written for a person of strong faith,"Or at least I didn't find it so. After reading more than 50%, I am stopping. I had not read any reviews prior to downloading....this book was offered as a special, and since it is so very well known and supposedly beloved, what could go wrong? I am greatly relieved to discover a number of low ratings, one 4-page written much better than I could hope to produce. Let me just say that I found the book empty and somewhat vain but for the life of me (no pun intended) I cannot articulate why. I strongly feared that if I continued reading, I might never find the peace to go to sleep tonight, so very depressing it seemed. Please, God, don't let this be heaven. Aren't the trials on this earth quite enough?"
1,predictable drivel,This book is a sorry regurgitation of Tuesdays with Morrie. The author tries to turn the wisdom of Tuesdays with Morrie into fiction a fails miserably. In order to enjoy this book you have to be willing to accept that unrelated events in peoples lives somehow tie together when they do not. It is also the most predictable book I've ever read. Skip it.
5,the five people you meet in heaven,"The best book!!! My whole family has read this book!!! It really make you sit back and think, I love this book.."
1,Tuesdays was better...,"For the record, i NEVER recommended this crappy book nor did i place it on my wish list. I do wish that i never wasted my time reading The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I will give Mitch Albom credit for his idea to write Tuesdays. The idea was so great that Mitch Albom's non-existant writing talent did not bother me. However, the fact that he is a mediocre writer was illuminated when i read this book. Finally, i think he is cocky and untalented sports announcer (in MI)."
1,Don't believe all the hype!,"This was truly the absolute, most disappointing book I've ever read. I was looking for an interesting read, and browsed through Amazon's Top Sellers list, and this book came well recommended. IT WAS AN UTTER WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.In the first few pages, the main character dies. The remainder of the book is an incredibly boring reminiscence of the man's life as he encounters a series of 5 people affected from his life in ""heaven"". The only reason I even continued to read this nostalgic, 2nd-grade-reading-level book was because I hoped for an ending that would give the 2 hours I wasted some meaning. All I got was an ending that, at least, put me out of my misery."
4,Oh Heaven is a Place on Earth,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a refreshing novel about life. Albom does an excellent job of making the reader question his or her views on the afterlife as well as the meaning of life itself Also, Albom discusses how the afterlife explains one's life and his or her purpose in it. In addition, the five people Albom chooses for Eddie to meet in heaven provide further insight as to why relationships are important, regardless of whether or not you know that person directly. Overall, The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a quick read, yet its unique message is different and thought-provoking and Albom has the reader hanging onto every last word, holding back the persistent tears of joy and triumph."
4,Well-intentioned but with some graphic violence,"I believe the author meant well with this book, and the conclusion is very positive and uplifting. However, some of the flashbacks to the main character's experiences during WWII are very gory. I'm sure the author would never have considered including [...] scenes in his ""inspiring"" book, so why did he think it was appropriate to include explicit depictions of sadistic violence and cruelty? If you're sensitive to violence, skip the WWII scenes."
2,Don't Believe The Hype!,"I was disappointed in this book. It got such rave reviews, I thought itwas going to blow my mind. To me, it was just ""ok."" I would not recommend it to a friend, and I wouldn't read it again."
2,Not very good,This book was a big disappointment and cannot even hold a flame to Tuesday's with Morrie. The book took 2 hours to read because their was no substance and the characters were 2 dimensional. It is definately something you can wait and read when it is in the bargain bin
4,We're all part of the story,"Halfway through this book I was only going to give it 3 stars but by the end I had added another star to the rating. I had tears in my eyes at the end.Three passages I really liked:Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.""Life has to end,"" she said, ""Love doesn't.""That each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.The last one sums it up perfectly. We're all here for a reason, even if we may not be able to see it at the time and we affect other people whom we mightn't be aware we're affecting, we mightn't even know them. We are not insignificant as a whole or as a single person, we're all part of THE STORY."
2,Not My Idea of Heaven,"The old of trap of high expectations doomed this book. As a follow up to ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", this was a big let down. The idea of 5 people in heaven waiting for each of us is somewhat interesting, but disapppointing in the telling. I anticipated something more as I began each person's part but never achieved the wonderful I expected."
2,A Little Slow,"Reading this book was similar to watching a slow movie that had a decent enough ending to make it worth your money and time.There was nothing flagrantly bad about this book but not one I would recommend. Upon any mystery element to the story, the author was too quick to offer up a perfect explaination leaving you nothing to really look forward to later on. I think the problem was that the book was too short and the one mystery in the book that lingers does not have a powerful enough answer to have made the wait worthwhile."
1,Arrogance,"Growing up in the Detroit area, you would be hard pressed to not know Mitch Albom. Mitch has brought a great deal of joy to many peoples lives over the age of 70. From his radio show, columns in the Detroit Free Press, to Tuesday's with Morrie Mitch one word can sum up Mitch...Arrogance. Whether it is the controversy involving his dealings with the University of Michigan's basketball team, or a stern lecture about what is right on his horrible radio show, Mitch knows it all. Just ask him he will tell it like it is. This book is no exception. Mitch's style of writing is similar to something you would expect from a first time author. Very basic and lacking in creativity. Do yourself a favor avoid Mitch at all costs. Those that come contact with his radio show, columns or books usually become incensed with rage. That is unless you are a putz like him."
2,Just Okay.,Kept my attention. Just a little too weird for me. The whole carnival setting & characters I just couldn't relate to.
4,Loved the outcome...,"I really liked this book. The way it's written makes it a very easy read, very simple, and really lovely. Most of the reviews here recap the story so I'll just put it out there that I thought the ending was perfect. Read this book. It made me smile."
4,A wonderful little big story,"This little book is a fast and fine read. It is short, but deals with one of the modern world's biggest taboos, death.Eddie dies at the age of 83, after having lived a life he is not sure was anything at all, a life he thinks did not have any impact on anyone. After his death he is confronted with 5 different people who all have a story to tell about their own lives. These stories all include some lesson for Eddie, getting him ready to find peace and go to heaven. There is a wonderful light tone in this book, even though Eddie and the people he meets in heaven all have their sorrows and sad lifestories. In fact, the meaning of their stories is to tell Eddie and also us, the readers, that no life is ever a wasted life, and no matter how unimportant one feels, we all have an impact on someone else's life."
3,slow read,"the book traces the last couple of minutes of Eddie's life and his journey to heaven in which he met 5 ppl who he had met in his life. it is almost like reading the christmas carole 5 times. it was not a bad book, but at times i find the pace it was going is very slow."
3,An Easy Snack Sized Read,"This is the story of Eddie's death and the five people he meets in heaven.It's a bit simple but I found it enjoyable. I liked the story, the characters and the way the story is told. It's not magnificent but it was good and moving and easy to read.More like a nice little snack of a book, rather than a meal."
3,The 5 people you meet in Heaven,I just read the 5 people you meet in Heaven after you die. It was interesting but since I had just lost my Mother and baby brother I was probably looking for answers for myself about them so this book kind of disappointed me. I think others will like this book if they are not seeking an answer like I was. It is an interesting read and well written and holds your interest til the end. I recommend it for just a quick pleasure read but not really comfort for hurting people who just lost a loved one.
3,thd five people you meet in heaven,My take on the book is it is from the prespective of other people whom the protagnaist meet in life. Many times we meet poeple whom we treat with little signifance and I believe the point of the book is that all people are of importance. Sometimes it is the insignificant folk who affect our lives and make it worse or for the better
3,not as good as Tuesdays with Morrie,"It was just a disappointment after Tuesdays With Morrie. The book was ok, but a bit reminiscent of A Christmas Carol and Its a Wonderful Life."
2,ehh,"i first thought this book would be alright, but after reading it, i didn't care for it too much. a problem i found with the book was its use of vulgarity...and yes, i do realize he was using it in the context of his characters speech, but to have it in a book on heaven and christianity seemed wrong to me. also, another problem i had with the book...in heaven we're to be there to glorify God and praise him, yet there was none of that in this book. so if that is something you are looking at this book for, i would reconsider because you won't find it in here."
2,Very disappointing,"The title got me hooked but didn't deliver. Blahhh. After reading Albom's ""Tuesday's with Morrie"" and reading the reviews, I was very excited about starting this book. It was almost good enough to keep reading but when I finished, I thought ""that's it?"" Very boring book and character's not developed well at all. Sorry Mr. Albom, I hope your next book is better."
4,An Inspiring Read,This book reminds us that everything we do in life matters. It's a good read that would lend itself to book clubs and groups. Good for introspection and thought.
4,It's A Classic Book by Mitch Albom,"I read this book as a follow up to some of the other novels written by Albom, and I thought it was very good. The set up is a little different from other novels by having multiple chapters in each `lesson' and each `lesson' a different length. This book makes you think about your life and it is east to relate to the characters when you think about the deeper meaning. As I was reading, I made sure to remember the previous lessons to think about how all the lessons and characters connect. It is one of those novels that you will want to read again immediately after you finish. I would recommend this novel if you enjoy stories about life's lessons and the mysteries behind the saying ""everything happens for a reason."""
2,KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME-BUT,"FIRST OF ALL I CAN'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS THIS BOOK HAS RECEIVED..IT WAS AN EASY READ BUT CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING IN LIGHT OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED REVIEWS..I GEUSS IT GOES TO SHOW WHAT A GOOD MARKETING TEAM CAN ACCOMPLISH.. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD OR INTERESTING STORY..OTHER THAN EDDIE'S HEROIC DEATH, I FOUND THE ENTIRE PREMISE RATHER BORING..ONLY TWO STARS FROM ME"
2,Disappointing :o(,"I am stunned that this book remains on the best seller list! This book is honestly just fair at best. It was not a horrible book, it was just missing something. I kept waiting for the story to get more interesting but, in the couple hours it took to read it--it never got any better. :o( Of course this is just my opinion...obviously alot of people think highly of this book. I just keep wondering WHY????"
3,"Poor Eddie, poorly developed","I was pretty pumped to read this book. I thought it was going to be deep and insightful.It was not so deep. As a matter of fact I found that the main character, Eddie, was underdeveloped and not all that likeable.Okay, he didn't have to be likeable, but he should have been sympathetic and I felt very little for this character. I really wanted to like the guy, but I didn't get to know him well enough to feel much for him.I did like the consistancy of the story as far as giving us reference points like birthdays to work from and I liked the basic theme of the book. The theme is one of a continuous journey where you find out in heaven how you impacted others while you were on earth. Just as an aside, I found the situations in &amp;quot;heaven&amp;quot; a bit more uncomfortable than I would hope heaven would be."
5,Touching,"A different read. Once I started, I could hardly put it down. I would highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed."
2,Only partially interesting,"I cannot deny that some of this book was fascinating, but having said that, it was not fascinating enough to hold my interest from start to finish. Very creative, but in parts, very boring as well. Not a rereader in my opinion."
3,Not that Great,"Before I read this book, I was looking forward to reading a thoughtful and engaging novel. I was kind of dissapointed. The book is very basic, it isn't very in depth. I was hoping to immerse myself in the world of the character, instead, I was bored with reading words. There was no connection. Overall, it is a decent enough novel, but if you are looking for an engaging read, don't spend your money on it."
5,You Have To Read This Book,"I fell in love with Tuesdays With Morrie and knew that I was going to enjoy reading Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet In Heaven. The book is an easy read, read the entire thing in two days- I couldn't put it down. The book really makes you think about your life, and also gives you an interesting perspective on what happens to you after death. I recommended the book to my grandmother who said after reading it that it changed her life. Anyone who enjoys a feel-good book needs to read The Five People You Meet In Heaven."
4,Makes you think about all the 'little people' you meet.,"I enjoyed the book although the enjoyment came more from reflecting on those people who have had an impact on my life. It's a good discussion starter and it makes me appreciate the everyday people that come into and out of my life. I also enjoyed Silent Witnesses in the Gospels by Allan Wright, he highlights the people in the Gospels who make a difference without saying a word, that book really made me think."
2,Manipulative,The entire book felt contrived to create a certain emotional effect in the reader. Full of cliches.
2,Not bad for light reading,"I was given this book as a gift and felt obliged to read it. I believe if I am honest in my review I would have to say that the best thing about the book is the fact that it is a very quick read. If you are looking for deep reading, this is not it.I have read the author's other book, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found it to be a fairly good book, but 'Five People' does not measure up to the bar set by the author's other work."
5,Excellent !,I have never read any of Mitch Albom's book. This one was recommended by Amazon when I purchased a different book. I got it used so I wasn't losing much if I didn't like it. BUT I couldn't put it down. The story was great and I would read it again. It made you think about the people we come into contact and how they imapct our lives. I Loved it!!!! I would like to read some of his other books now. I found a new author that I love.
3,Beautiful story,"What a beautiful story. There is nothing complex here. No literary genius behind the pen. No hidden metaphors. Just a lovely tale about one lonely man's journey into the afterlife. What happens after we die? I say we slowly rot in the ground, but this novel paints a much brighter vission of life after death. The title says it all. I don't usualy get emotional unless I lose a lot of money playing poker, but this book is right up there."
2,Looks good but you can do better,"I was disappointed in this case and do not recommend it. Pros: It looks cool, its quiet, and the inside has solid fit and finish. Cons: Power supply was DOA and Antec was not helpful with getting a replacement, did not cover my shipping costs nor offer any assistance with the new PS I had to buy to diagnose it. The HDD and Power lights on the front of the case don't actually exist, unless they are hidden really well. There are better cases for less money out there."
5,Very Nice,"This is my third Antec case and by far the best. The hard drives are very easy to install and maintain in this case. The mounting system system keeps vibration from being transmitted to the frame. Another plus is the removable filter in front of the air intake. In my older cases, the hard drive became coated with lint without this feature.It is very quiet with the case fan on low speed. I had to run it at a higher speed probably because of my four hard drives. I replaced the fan with one that could be controlled by the BIOS."
4,An uneven jaunt along Mulberry Street,"First published in 1937, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street"" is, I believe, the earliest of Dr. Seuss' many children's books. While it is an entertaining book with humorous illustrations, on the whole I find ""Mulberry Street"" to be oddly unsatisfying.The story concerns young Marco, who has been asked by his father to tell him what he sees on the walk home from school. Seeing nothing but a horse and wagon, Marco lets his imagination run wild, until the horse and wagon are transformed into an elephant and brass band, accompanied by numerous other people and animals.Without giving away the ending, I will say that the book seems to deliver a curiously conflicted message regarding storytelling and imagination. Although ""Mulberry Street"" is not at the level of Seuss' greatest classics, it is still an important landmark in children's literature, and would make a good addition to any family or school library."
1,READ WARRANTY BEFORE BUYING,"Wish I had read warranty before buying this memory foam mattress. After 6 months, mattress has lost support and takes a long time to recover shape. We are constantly turning and rotating mattress to try to find an area that still maintains support. E-mailed company, through Amazon, and was told to read warranty. First disclaimer in warranty states that warranty DOES NOT COVER increase in softness or decrease in slow recovery (retaining shape) features. Very poor product."
1,Visco-elastic? How bout just a sponge?,"It is made with such a cheap material that you will not be able to find another product to waste your money on, ever."
3,The Thousand Yawns,"Although I enjoyed The Dark Elf trilogy (In my humble opinion it was the best trilogy of Drizzt), I think the story (well, what story?) it's getting more a fight, let's find another excuse for a fight.well, to tell the truth, it's an OK book, but the characters are getting stale, too predictible. If you like Drizzt, you'll like this book, but don't expect too much out of it."
3,...,ech. Im not sure what to say. The book was alright. Salvatore has written better than this. The first few pages of the dark elf trilogy were better than the whole book! Not to mention i felt as if most of the story was pointless and filler.
4,The best is yet to come...,"Salvatore is killing us! This book is a wonderful lead to so many different roads of possibilities. As with any trilogy you have to expect the author to set up the scene and this book does just that. If you have no experience with the characters or story lines do not start with this one. You have to understand the depth of each character to understand the enormity of the situation in their eyes. Drizzt- his worst fear, he's alone. Cattie Brie- her adoptive father out of action, facing the reality of mortality. Bruenor- ?? Anticipate the possibilities!"
3,I was a bit disappointed in this book.,"I'm an avid (or rabid, some say) Salvatore fan. I've read all of his work and have been waiting for another dark elf book, so I was very excited to find this at my bookstore. As far as I'm concerned, no book can rival the original Dark Elf trilogy - the 1st three are masterpieces - FAR better than Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, Salvatore seems to have lost some of his uniqueness and originality in this book. It is so much like The Two Towers that I couldn't help but think that this was a quick, make money while LotR is big again book. It is worth the money and the time spent reading it but it is far below his usual standards. Of course I'll buy the next 2, due for release this Oct and Oct 2004 respectively, and hope to see the old Salvatore reemerge."
4,The Thousand Orcs,"You will either love Salvatore's works or you will be luke warm regarding them. There doesn't seem to be any in between. I was flushed with excitement reading and could hardly put down this book. Make plans to have your phone off, your drinks handy and a comfortable chair to finish this book."
3,packaging issue,"My shipment broke open insdie the box. Yes it was an absolute mess. One bottle did not break, it was good."
1,"too wordy, too advance for an intro book","cecie starr, gets mixed up in her own poorly written (and many times, poorly organized) textbook and produces numerous grammatical errors that make her sentences have two meanings, or mean something else that's completely wrong. the textbook uses too many pronouns, like ""it"" ""them"" ""they"" and you end up wasting time finding out what ""that"" was 2 to three sentences ago. one ends up spending too much time figuring out what she tried to mean, and the logic of her grammar, rather than learning the new material. so you end up reading a chapter over and over again without much help. her pages are jam packed with new and therefore hard concepts to grasp, without much explanation. starr needs an editor big time, especially when it comes to simplifying her complicated and poor writing of the already not so simple concepts of biology to new students. i do not recommend this book (or most of cecie starr's textbooks) to novices, this book is an easy read for bio experts."
5,A riveting novel of loyalty and courage,"Ernest Hemingway was one of the most popular, influential, and charismatic of the American 20th century novelists. Books On Tape has undertaken to publishing an unabridged audiobook edition of Hemingway's body of work. Ably narrated by Alexander Adams, For Whom The Bell Tolls is Hemingway's classic story of Robert Jordan, an American fighting with anti-fascist guerillas in the mountains of Spain. This riveting novel of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, inspired idealism and battlefield disenchantment is a timeless testament...."
1,It tolls for anyone who has to read this boring book,"I just can't get with Hemingway, and I have trudged through five or six of his allegedly best works. This one as usual has a boring plot, characters that you can't possibly care about, and dull prose. A real yawner. Would very many people think he was great if they hadn't been told that every day of their lives by their high school English teachers?"
2,hemingway,this book was broing to me only because i didnt understand it well. i think it has a mature taste to it. if i was a little older i think i would have appreciated it a lot more. i read it for a 9th grade english class and it was not of my choice. it was boring went on and on for too long
1,Blah,"Hemingway was a grreat promoter of himself. A lot of bull. This book is a rambling piece of blige. Hemingwasy was a good writer, but not all (and I should say most of) his books are dull as ditch water. This is a perfect example of dull writing. His ""personal property"" was bull fighting and the Spanish Civil war...give me a break. If this thing tells you anything about the civil war you are too dumb to be counted. Hemingway is ok, but come on, hardly the ""Great Writer of the 20th century"" that he wants us to believe. Talk about great publicity, this guy had it in spades. The bells just don't toll. But what can you expect from someone who commits suicide. A coward. Skip this one."
3,Could have been better,"I learned a very important lesson here; take a good peak at the book before you get it. The Scribner publication (paperback) of this Hemingway Novel wasn't the one I believe most people read. This was spattered everywhere with ""Thee"" and ""Thou."" That really detracted from the story. Unfortunately I don't think even with out that distraction the story wouldn't have been much better. It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture. I'm not that familiar with Spanish history and wasn't sure who represented what. Also a strange personal quirk; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan, and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon. I guess it's the common name Robert."
5,A 20th century classic,"Having recently come back from Paris, I went through a Hemingway phase, starting with his memoirs of his Paris days, then I stumbled on this book.The stumbling was a fortunate accident, for this book is amazing. Hemingway's short but powerful prose is in perfect form. I actually find Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are different.Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions, and the sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully.I also agree with one of the other reviewers above, in that my appreciation is probably helped by age. A lot of the emotions of loss, doubt, disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years. It's a good adventure story nonetheless, but might lose its power for a youger audience."
3,teeeeeeeeeediously looooooooooong,"i had to read 'for whom'for school, and being a female teenager i did not like this book. i found that the description was unnessecarily long and that a large portion of the book was Robert Jordan's thoughts which i found to be totally unrealistic and boring. the highlights of this book are the chivalry of El Sordo and the story told by Pilar about the brutality of the war. i found maria to be a shallow ditz. the characters are realistic but the plot is lacking and there was no character that i felt i could really relate with. but then again i'm not the biggest fan of hemmingway."
5,Real people in a real world,"Hemingway's work never ceases to amaze me, in that he peoples a very real world with painfully real people, and all with a paucity of words that would cripple any other author. You can feel the burden, the frustration, the hope and the cynicism of each person in the first few words they speak. The Spanish Civil War is simply a pressure cooker that brings out the inner being that truly defines the person, in all their fragile and sometimes irrational glory. An unmatchable masterpiece."
2,"Really, really tedious","It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel. Hemingway's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and, at times, ludicrous. Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing, leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed. When, in fact, there really was no point at all.Overly long and arduous. Something to be foisted upon unhappy high-schoolers. Hemingway's just not the sort whose style appeals to."
3,I'd just like to say...,"I found the book to be a little tiresome to be honest. Although I did really enjoy the final section of Robert Jordan's thoughts on death, I found the rest hard to read at times. The style I thought was dry and bare, too much so for my liking, and the characters (particularly the hero) incapable of much emotion themselves or of summoning emotion in me. His style was ""sparse and halting"", as Jack Kerouac said, and this definitely had a bad effect on the book, especially the sections with Maria, which I expected to be brimming with passion and joy. Instead, we just got rather turgid descriptions of ""it moving"". Having said that, it improved as the time of the bombing drew near and the tension rose, but personally I found it too dry and arid."
5,Boring?,"This is the best book I have ever read. Hemingway is the best author I have ever come across. This book is perhaps the best example of his unique style of writing. If you, like some of the reviewers here, find this book boring, you have no interest in humanity, war, life, death or love. It also has the best ending to a book, ever. Read it."
3,dionesian at its best,"this book is a drunkolgue. of course, it's very well written. the style, is a style of a superb journalist. but the characters' alcoholism is piercing. the choices they make are hardly romantic, rather they are tragic. the emptiness of the spirit hidden behind the spirit of alcohol pierces through. how so many mice and men have fashioned their lives after this novel puzzles me."
5,A must read for law students!,"I have my nose glued to this book. I bought the book because I am a new legal studies student and was told that the Supreme Court uses the federalist papers to define the constitution. I thought, ""what else could be better than to read the same papers that the supreme court uses?"" So, I had to buy this book and was really impressed. It is well organized, has a great preface, and is loaded full of text to be engulfed in.Learning about the history of our legal system is not only essential for a legal student but should be important for every U.S. citizen as well. It explains some of the things that were going on around the constitutuional convention and why the laws are how they were written.The purchasing experience was, as always, terrific and I got the book in record time. This is a thick book and will take quite some time to finish reading but, with that said, the book should be continually used as a reference book.I recommend this one!"
1,Boycott,"I entirely support the idea that people should boycott this publisher. This is an affront to every human being who loves this country and what it represents. These people should be ashamed of themselves as should anyone who knowingly purchases one of their preposterous and slanderous products.In short, I support this boycott."
3,9 dollar book,"The cover was glued back on with out care and the corners look like they were draged across concrete. You can't really complain about a 9 dollar book that would probobly be sold for 20 at barnes and noble, but it was listed as new."
4,Great book,I found this book educational and informative. Would recommend it to anyone. A must have for anyone interested In American history.
4,"Great fit , cute , safe for baby but deflated so fast","Great fit , cute , safe for baby but deflated so fast. My husband has to re-pump it every couple days"
2,I'm Sorry........................I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay.I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!"
3,Eh..Not enough pictures,"As bad as it sounds this book didn't have enough pictures. Well before I go on like me start by saying I'm a pro-wrestler with previous grappling experience...This book makes a fairly good read. But Still when I pick up a book on martial arts I expect to see pics of real people in it.. This book had only drawings. Ofcourse this isn't really a tech nique book, it's more like a book that explains Catch wrestling. If you do pick up this book also pick up ""winning Wrestling Moves"" and ""Gene LeBell's Encyclopedia of finishing holds"". This book really explains some of the Techs that are hown in the other book..I still recommend this book, but pick up the other two in conjunction with it.. All are sold here."
4,PROUD CITADEL,THE BOOK IS IN BETTER CONDITION THAN EXPECTED..THE ONLY THING REALLY BAD ABOUT THESE BOOKS IS THE SMELL. WHEN STORING OLDER BOOKS THAT AREN'T READ VERY OFTEN INSERT A CLEAN DRYER SHEET IN BETWEEN THE PAGES..IT CUTS DOWN OR ELIMINATES THE OLD SMELL ENTIRELY..SINCE RECEIVING THESE BOOKS I MYSELF HAVE DONE THIS..THANK YOU AMAZON FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE THESE BOOKS AGAINAND I WILL BE PLACING ANOTHER ORDER FOR MORE...LORA
5,The Most Astute Celebrity Biographical Dictionary Around,"If you love good, pointed writing, writing that really goes to the heart of what we see on the big screen when we see certain film actors, this is your book. Really well-written, certainly opinionated (but justifiably, in all cases), thoughtful, insightful, amusing, witty. As you read each entry, you'll be saying to yourself, ""That's EXACTLY how I feel about SoAndSo!,"" because the author expresses each film person's essence so aptly. The author has apparently known and/or met many of the entries, so is able to add personal experience with these people to his vast historical knowledge of their work. A wonderful work."
2,Bios by a Badmouth,"I was looking forward to something more opinionated than the useful and comprehensive but rather dry film bios of Katz's Film Encylopedia. Well, I got opinion in this Biographical Dictionary.Unfortunately, that opinion is from someone who apparently thinks one must be a curmudgeon in order to be a critic. It is obvious from this massive and hard-laboured work, that David Thomson is a pedant and a misanthrope. He really doesn't like much of anyone, especially those whose output is entertainment.Woe be unto the actor or director deemed here as (a) politically incorrect or (b) an audience pleaser. As George Lucas has said, Thomson doesn't know much about the movie business. But he does know about Ceenéma Art.If you are the type who thinks himself a cinema Enthusiast, who lives at the Penultimate Picture Palace, swooning at spittle on the faces of Dreyers's close-ups, you will no doubt relish Thomson's tome."
3,Good enough for price.,This foot warmer is good enough for that price. It doesn't get warm enough for me. Butit avoid over heat and safe.
5,"FIVE ""GOLD"" STARS","This movie has it all. Most movies I think of as ""check your brain at the door"" but, this movie was thought provoking and thrilling at the same time. It has action, drama, comedy, and believe it or not animation. This movie is well worth checking out and it deserves to be available on DVD. Let this movie be a wake up call to all the ""cookie cutter"" movie directors and producers."
4,violent = fun,"People are complaining about this movie because it wasn't""thought provoking"". Like so many other people, I enjoy watching films that stimulate my mind, and actually give me some type of knowledge by the end. But everyonce in awhile, I like to watch nothing but pure, simple violence and sex...this movie provided just that. If you haven't seen it yet, and you've read the reviews, you already know the basic plot. See it anyway if you like alot of senseless violence, blood, drug use, demented humor and Julie Delphy nake. This movie is junk food for your head, and everyone likes junk food everyonce in awhile...unless you're a complete tighta$$. Good ACTION movie, it also has a unique soundtrack"
1,Do not buy this phone.,Its keypad surface started rubbing off within two weeks of the purchase. Circuit City replaced it immediately but he new phone soon had the same quality problem with the keys and then 6 months later the ringer died. Calling Vtech customer service was useless. The phone was under warranty but hey require that you send them the old phone back first before they send out a replacement. That leaves you without a phone for a minimum of two weeks plus you have to pay for shipping!
5,On Line Purchase of Mosaic by Soheir Khashoggi,"Exellent writing style and great insight into Arab culture. After reading her first two books, I knew that I had to get this one as well - only it to a while to access locally. Out of desperation I tried Amazon and did an on line purchase. Although I was a bit impatient with having to wait a few weeks for the delivery. the book arived in secure and solid packaging. Im impressed."
4,The Real Deal,"I saw Pete on a bill with The Real Live Show at the Mercury Lounge last winter and was blown away by his performance. Who *was* this guy? Couldn't wait to get my hands on his new album and after hearing ""Camouflage Is Relative"" I am not disappointed. The guy's got talent, there's no doubt. Call him the anti-Eminem if you want (""So Sensitive""), he's got word skills up the wazoo while dropping beats that are hard and smooth at the same time. Hightlights on this album include the great ex-girlfriend song ""Final"" (yeah, you know I been there), ""The Fall of Williamsburg,"" (""And the South Side be like who the f*ck are you?"") and ""It Rains in New York Too,"" which has some of the best lyrics I've heard on a rap song. Why this guy is not a bigger star I do not know. Catch him live if you can or just buy this damn record."
4,Lyrics are on par with great production,Miser's known for his stellar production work. The lyrics on this album are matching his compositions... well worth the purchase. Looking forward to the cat's next release.
4,Great to fall asleep to,I bought this to play when I need to relax and start to fall asleep. It does a good job - I know music is very personal and subjective - so my 4 stars could be some else's 1 star. So listen to the samples before you buy this!
2,I recieved a different book cover,"The story line fits the sequel with suspense, action, a plausible plot but tends to be ""exposition-heavy"" when Colonel Dmitri Priabin (KGB) catches up with Gant and Anna, by boarding the train at Chudovo just before Leningrad and ends with Anna being shot attempting to cross into Finland.Almost as good as ""Firefox"" and a much better read than my novel ""The Revelation, Year 2027, it's Coming!"""
2,Books were fine. Better be prepared to wait!,"Books were fine and in decent shape for their age. To say service was bad, however, would imply that there was any at all. Ordered my books in early August. Heard nothing for a month! Then got email notifying me of tracking numbers and items shipped. Checked the #s, for tracking to only find out that they did not exist. Emailed the company stating the problem and copies of the order and tracking #s. Got nothing for nearly three months. Then someone asked me how my order went in November. Again, I described by problem. and after three more weeks and a short ""I'll check into it"" reply. I finally got my books after 3 1/2 months. If you are REALLY looking for a certain book it might be worth it otherwise I'd pass if I were you."
1,Don't get the audio book!,This review only applies to the audio version of the book. Stockard Channing obviously wasn't getting paid by the hour - I've never heard an audio book be read so fast! I don't know if anyone could follow a book being read like this.
1,Missing and Reprinted,This book was a sad excuse. The cover was in great condition. There were chapters missing and reprinted in the wrong place in this book. It was upsetting not being able to know how the book ended.
4,Childhood favorite of mine,I purchased this as a gift for my seven year-old niece. She enjoyed it and is a fan of the series.
1,Wasn't the quality I expected.,"It was delivered at time. And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance; however, it wasn't.When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe, which is the reason why I bought it, the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance. Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons. Any way, the prodoct wasn't the same value or quality of pumma's shoes that I have bought in the past."
4,Great shoe,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
3,35 cents per napkin. Do the math.,"Good product, no question about it. No diaper rush - almost guaranteed. But 35 cents per one washcloth is a ridiculous price. Hence 3 stars. Get it at baby'srus - still expensive but not that crazy (18 cents per one).They also changed the packaging lately so it is less convenient."
2,Kinda skimpy on number of entry of words,Kinda skimpy on number of entries for 2nd grader. I would recommend when buying a Thesaurus for your kid to check for the number of word entries to see if its appropriate for your child's age group. Next time I would purchase one with more entries. Otherwise its a good resource for 1st grade or below.
4,good but hard,"I am an undergraduate, and while I find the book interesting and good, I just wanted to emphasize that it is very sophisticated and dense. I am a rising junior, and I have been reading the book on and off for about a year. The book is well-written and interesting, but it's very sophisticated and I probably should have gotten a lower-level book even though I have more than the mathematical prerequisites. It's a bit discouraging since I historically am extremely strong in math. So just to warn you, it's good but it might be over your head."
5,Great Physical Mathematics,"Great mathematical physics book. I bought it as a supplement text for a mathematical physics course as well as help in quantum physics course. Got me through a lot of Quantum homeworks. I still use this book as a reference for math and physics concepts. The ordering of the book is a little weird and skips the some of the basic concepts in linear algebra but explores a wide variety of other topics including Green Functions, Cauchy-Riemann, Fourier analysis and transforms, Dirac notation, ect. At the end of topic the book works through examples. A must have for physicist, engineers, and mathematicians."
1,heatilator gfk21 review,"I Purchased this product(heatilator gfk21 fan kit) and it shows up as a bag of parts, similar to the review that was already here. No instructions found. I found some from the heatilator website but they didn't match what I was sent. I returned this product, I didn't want to deal with the headache of ""guessing"" how to attach it. Dealing with amazon was no problem, but the 3rd party place that sent me the fan didn't have any instructions. good luck!"
5,THE GREATEST STOCK MARKET SPECULATOR OF ALL TIME,"I re-read this terrific autobiography every few years just to immerse myself once again in the common sense and wisdom of one of the most brilliant men to have ever speculated in stocks. Before there was an SEC or computerized databases, Bernard Baruch made $200 million from scratch. He was a virtual ""walking computer"" who bested the most powerful financial figures of his day. A TRULY GREAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY!!!"
5,"Works great, $25 less than other locations",The brake controller is very easy to install and use. We switch the controller between vehicles so the ability to make adjustments are necessary.
4,"The Evolution of Modern Medicine A Series of Lectures Delivered at Yale University on the Silliman Foundation in April, 1913","This now historical series of lectures, presented by the father of modern clinical medicine at the end of the 19th century is a nice summary of the evolution of modern medicine, beginning before the Greeks. Some will find the style ""stuffy"", but it is appropriate to the time of its presentation and gives a good insight into the evolution of modern medicine as well as the talents of its author, William Osler."
4,Parker refill,Refill write smoothly and are easy to read. I would like a choice of fine points which are not available in this product.
5,Perfect,"Worked as soon as I put it in my pen, writes smooth and a fair price. Not much else you can say."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I have this gel pen refill in black and they write very well. However, they are fine point and the blue are medium point which is too broad for my writing needs. The refill also skips when I write. The fine black gel refill doesn't do that. The medium point is good for some writing needs so I will continue to use them for such tasks as filling out forms."
3,Super Reader,"Supernatural team-up.When you have a psychic detective vampire slayer, what else would happen? Team-up, sure, nookie too if they happen to be of the appropriate flavour for each other.With a boyfriend around Sonja is not quite as nasty and unstable, and the search for monsters, especially the vampire that tortured her to start with, and her own parents continues."
3,weak follow-up to Sunglasses,"Nancy Collins creates an intriguing complex world full of various occult creatures co-existing with normal humans, unfortunately the writing is rarely up to the task of painting a convincing atmosphere for these beings to inhabit, so that it gradually devolves into a series of routine gore-filled encounters. The dialogue is sometimes awkward, too. A disappointment after Sunglasses After Dark."
4,It is still Sex,I really enjoyed the book and I am using it with my youth group to talk about sex. The problem of masturdabion needs to be dealt with. We all know that sex outside of marriage is another issue that the 21st Century ignore. It is alright to discuss it as long as it does not hit home. The book is one that should be read by every minister as well as lay person in the Body of Christ.By Any Other Name It's Still Sex
1,Itasca hikers,"First of all, the shoes received were not as pictured --- they were not low-top hikers, they were higher topped like boots. Then, they were too narrow. Did not come in anything but medium width."
1,B for BAD,"Never buy it! I wasted 25 bucks for this stupid thing. Didnt even fit me. Dont get fooled by the picture in the web. Here's my story.Payed $26...a $8 for shipping alone.I was eagerly waiting for this. Even the most local brands will send the shoes in a box. well, I got it in a dirty white cover! with black marks all over it. And it comes with a 5 pound load of ads(now I know why the shipping cost was high...)The lace and the spongy stuff in it is all in GREEN color. know what i mean....anyone can spot your shoe even a mile away....its so glaring GREEN!The lace allignment is all distorted. Doesn't even look decent. I am right now looking at returning this thing.My advice....DONT BUY IT!"
1,Unfortunately not suitable for serious hiking,"I have these boots and unfortunately have to agree with the majority of the reviews. I'm not a fan of coming on here and trashing a product, but I felt like this was warranted. I got them cheap and was excited for what I expected to be a serviceable pair of hiking boots. I was very disappointed. I've only worn them a few times, and each time they have left my feet aching horribly. The soles, as others have stated, are inexcusably thin. Mine haven't split or broken, but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support. The entire boot is unstable. They aren't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll. Don't purchase these expecting to do any serious hiking and not be in pain by the end of the day. Get a real pair of hiking shoes."
1,DO NOT ORDER!!!!! MIAMI VICE GEEN IS ALL THEY HAVE AVAILABLE.,"I ordered these in brown on brown - the most hideous shade of green arrived. When I called the vendor, Fogdog said they no longer have the brown on brown - yet they are still listing them for sale on Amazon. DO NOT BE FOOLED - YOU WILL GET SOME UGLIFIED MIAMI VICE GREEN BOOTS!!! YUCK! 5 days before Christmas and I have to go shopping again!"
2,Leather trim cracking/peeling after 1 week,"I agree with others the boot is suitable for only light wear. Support is average to poor. And after 1 week the leather trim has started to crack and peeI. I put oil on it and this seems to have stopped the process. Other than that, I have no issue with color or style. And it was VERY inexpensive, 21 dollars and change, free shipping. The delivery and condition of shoes was fine. If you do get them because of the price, just be aware they're only suitable for basically walking around town. And you'll probably have to replace the insole with a better one, and treat the leather trim to prevent it from peeling/cracking."
3,Like The Beatles,"I don't normally write reviews on here, but I thought that the last one was a little too harsh. There were a few typos in the book, yes, but the sentences were not necessarily run-ons. They were just more complex than I ever expected from the author.This is not a masterpiece, but if you are a Tickethead, I suggest it. It gives a good behind the scenes look at the station and what happened when Rocco was let go. The urban and suburban stuff, while often rhetoric, is substantive and will either make you mad or grin in agreement. It is incoherent, but Rocco points that out himself. He apparently is going to offer a more focused book someday. Anyhow, I recommend it. And Rocco, I am glad you are doing well. You have kept enough of your abrasiveness to stay edgy, but lost enough of it to be entertaining and more than tolerable."
4,Restores your faith in America!,"This book is exactly what I had hoped it would be...a man capturing his memories and adventures from his walk across america (partial walk). I loved hearing about the different characters he came across and the generosity of the people. For those of you that have done some traveling through our great country, I am sure you have experienced some of the same. Peter Jenkins is not a professional writer and never professed to be...he is just sharing his experiences and I am grateful that he did."
5,Timeless and relevant today,"I first read this book in high school in the early 1980's. At that time, I felt secure in the 'faith' of the religion I'd been taught and found Mr. Jenkins' lack of faith really odd and confusing.However, here I am a middle aged person and finding myself with the same ambiguity about faith in God or in America. While reading the text again didn't necessarily answer my own quandaries about faith, it does make me wish I had the ability to walk across America and find myself as he did. There are amazing stories and amazing people all over the planet, and is someone could take a truly accurate poll, I believe we'd find that there is much more good than bad on our planet.I suspect Mr. Jenkins would agree."
4,Quick Read - Good Book; Could have been GREAT!!,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and left a very favorable impression on the how each of us can rise above our preconceptions of others. Some very deep and probing subjects were only brushed upon which to some extent allows each of us to fill in the depth based on our experiences. However, I would have loved to hear more of how the hermit in the mountain became so ""magical"" for him. Also, at the end, everything races forward at a pace well beyond and out of sync with the beginning of the story. I highly recommend the book and wished that the journey lasted a lot longer so as to more fully explore some of the more magical and cathartic experiences in this person's life."
4,Slightly dated but worth reading,"This is a very good book that captures a period in American history that is rapidly fading. Not quite as good as ""Blue Highways"" by Least Heat Moon, but most definitely very well told and a recommended read. If for no other reason, read this book to reflect on ways of living that Washington careerists are set out to destroy and erase from America."
2,Disappointing,"I read a few other reviews where the writing in this book was described as amateur, lacking focus and ham-fisted (what a great word). The premise of this book is so great but the author's poor writing style and lack of meaning is incredibly disappointing. The book feels like a work log of what he did every day and misses so many opportunities to share insight and depth. One of my favorite inconsistencies is when the author shares that he has been a strict vegetarian for the prior 3 years and then only 13 pages later describes how he orders 15 ""big-man"" burgers from a fast food drive in. What?!?!I was generous and gave this book a 2 because I really like the idea of seeing the country by walking across it. Unfortunately the title was probably the best part of the book. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,Mostly accurate,"The product had good delivery time and safe packaging. The item was described as new, but had a print date of 1979. It was, however, in very good condition."
2,Good walkers don't [necessarily] make good writers,"I was disappointed in this book. The author is not a strong writer. He tries to compensate for it by being overly dramatic, which only makes some passages border on the absurd, such as worrying about the ""shark-infested waters"" while crossing a bridge over an inlet of Lake Ponchartrain!With a personal narrative it's also important for the reader to form a bond with or at least take an interest in the narrator. I found that difficult to do with what the author gave me to work with.Frankly I'm surprised this book sold so well. I agree with another reveiwer that ""Blue Highways"" is a much better written book of this genre."
3,"It is okay, not great, but okay","You know, I think I expected something more along the lines of Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways. It pales in comparison. It has its moments but most of the time I found myself getting irritated by the guy. As a ""finding yourself"" autobiographical piece it will pass but just barely. I give him kudos for being young and for this being his first book."
4,"Nice, but a little short if you are tall","These are a little short on my 6' tall wife. They come up just over her knee. The color and material are nice. They do stay up fine but I wouldn't call them thigh highs. I would imagine if you were 5'5"" to 5' 8"" they may get up to your thigh. But that is just a guess.She is a normal sized person, not skinny and not overweight."
4,Fun and Fancy Free,"A delightful movie that demonstrates what made Walt Disney movies such a pleasure to watch both as a child and as ""an older"" child.Dina Shore and Bergan/McCarthy were voices and images from a past gentler time."
3,Fun and Fancy Free Gold Collection DVD,"""Fun and Fancy Free"", is a very good movie. However, the problem with this package feature is that it's first story, ""Bongo"", seems to outstays it's welcome. The story is well written, but it just seems to last forever sometimes. ""Bongo"" was actually going to be one of Disney's full length features by it's self (and possibly a follow-up to ""Dumbo""), uh, Im glad it wasn't.""Mickey & The Beanstalk"" is really what makes this movie really great. The animation is really terrific, Donald provides his outrageous humor, as always, and the narration has some laughs in it to. Also, the fact that Walt Disney is voicing Mickey, is an added bonus.The short featurette on the DVD, ""The Story Behind Fun And Fancy Free"", is very brief, but provides great insight."
2,Good if you like Older cartoons,"I thought this was a newer Disney cartoon when I saw this cover, however it was an older style cartoon, the content was good, it just wasnt for me because my daughter is very young and didnt pay attention to it as much as the newer Mickey Animations."
2,Too much other stuff,"It has a lot of other little segments or shows that are not Mickey. My son wants only Mickey so when the other stuff came on he was uninterested. Not that those other things were bad, we were just expecting all Mickey."
2,Too Many Forced Previews,"The cartoons are okay, but I don't really care for all the previews. I have to hit the next button severl times before I can get to the main menu and if I don't do this I will end up owning the entire Disney library."
5,INGENIOUS INVENTION-WONDERFUL SHOWER GIFT,"I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO BUY THIS FOR ME FOR OUR 7 MONTH OLD, AND HE OF COURSE SAID IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY, BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW HOW SHE HELD IT AND WAS ABLE TO EAT AND SUCK AND JUST HANDLE IT, EVEN HE WAS AMAZED.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE, IT CAN BE A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON YOUR BABYS' LIFE. AND MY BABY LOVES IT, AND I AM SURE THAT YOURS WILL TOO. I AM GIVING IT OUT AS GIFTS TO ALL MY FIRENDS WITH BABIES. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. I FEEL LIKE I CAN GIVE HER THINGS TO EAT AND NOT WORRY AS MUCH. I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU ALL. IT REALLY IS GREAT."
1,Disappointing,"I was swayed by all the positive reviews of this product. I am sure that it works with *some* babies, but unfortunately my daughter is not one of them. She won't put the mesh part in her mouth at all...she keeps turning it the opposite way and chewing on the handle. While the feeder seems like an innovative idea, I think I'm better off either pureeing foods or just waiting to give her certain foods when she is older and less likely to choke."
5,Fabulous,"I bought this for my son when he was 7 months and it was great. Banana's etc.. are slippery but with this he could hold the fruit. It really cut down on mess too, no sticky fingers all over the high chair and everywhere. Fantastic idea as you can now give fruit to babies without the worry of choking and they get to enjoy fresh fruit that they can hold!"
5,Best Gift I Recieved,"When I was expecting my second son, I opened this feeder and had no idea what it was. Now it's the gift I plan to give to all of my expecting friends! Unlike some of the other reviews, I find it easy to clean and easy to use. My 11 month old sits in his high chair while I'm busy in the kitchen and can actually have a piece of that cucumber that I'm putting in the salad! Praises to the creater of this product. I only wish I had it when my other son was a baby."
1,Caused a rash after each use,"A neighbor had recommended this product and it sounded great. I bought it along with extra bags and my baby loves it. We have used it several times and have found two major problems with it. It is really a pain to clean but worse than that - my baby breaks out in a rash around his mouth after each use, despite us washing his face immediately after he is done eating. We have determined that he is allergic to the mesh and won't be using it again. What is it made of anyway?? I threw the packaging out and wish I had kept it."
1,ICK!,"This product looked GREAT online and I thought it would be the perfect way to allow my young son to feed himself independently some of the time. He wanted NOTHING to do with it. Really, would YOU want to eat your food through a piece of mesh? I didn't think so."
4,Love this product!!,"I really love this product. My son is teething and I cut bananas into chunks and freeze them, then place them in the feeder. He goes ballistic! And it feels good on his gums too!I've given him watermelon, cantelope, all kinds of fruit in it. Definitely worth the money. My only reservation is cleaning. It's a little hard to get spic and span, even with the dishwasher, but it's worth the extra effort too!"
5,Godzilla hearts Scorpio!,"Godzilla makes friends with a giant scorpion! That is one of the wackiest notions I've ever heard about Godzilla. Still, one wonders if there friendship can last? Find out in this monster romp!"
5,Good for your attitude.,"Music doesn't just have an effect on you WHILE you're listening; those words and melodies keep running around in your head. To have the best attitude, it helps to have positive, life-giving, healthy words going through your mind, and this CD does the trick. I am the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on what it takes to keep a good attitude, and this CD, without a doubt, does the trick. As long as you're going to listen to good music, the words might as well lift you up, too!"
4,A Tight Album From The Man Behind the Boards of Talib Kweli,"After thoroughly enjoying ""Train of Thought"" by Reflection Eternal aka Talib Kweli and DJ Hi-Tek, I decided it would be in my best interests to pick up Tek's solo album and see what he could do ""his own"". Of course, being mainly a producer, it was a short period of time before I realized that ""Hi-Teknology"" was really a collarborative effort by Hi-Tek and his many MC compadres. Nonetheless, this album is still a cut above the watered-down hip-hop so common today. Standouts are ""The Sun God"", a perfect combination of beats and rhymes (supplied effortlessly by Common), ""Breakin' Bread"" features great production by our man (gotta love that fuzzy flute sample), ""Round and Round"", ""Get Ta Steppin'"", as well as many others. In all, this is a solid album from one of today's top hip-hop producers and is not to be missed."
3,hi tek,"Don't get me wrong, Hi Tek is one of the greatest producers out there, but there just isn't enough material of substance on here. It's a 3.5/5. The bangers on here are tracks like get ta steppin with mos def, the sun god by common, (not as good as tekzilla, which tek couldn't get cleared for the album)and theme from hi tek with the greatest mc out there right now, Talib Kweli. Almost all of the beats on here are bangin, curtesy of Hi Tek, but there are way to many wack mc's on here. If he had made an album with all mc's like black star and common, than this would likely be a classic, or at least a near classic. If your just gettin' into Tek than I would first check out the classic album released in 2000, Reflection Eternal. He also did some great sh*t for black star, which is also a classic. Don't think of Hi teknology as a full album, but more of an appetizer, untill the next classic album with Kweli or Black Star."
4,Covers Every Aspect of Premillennial Prophecy,"This was a textbook for a class I took on eschatology. Most of the book was assigned reading, and I chose to read the remaining chapters that were unassigned. I was impressed with how thorough the book treated every single aspect of end times. Many views are given to the various issues, but the traditional dispensational views are almost always defended. The book is somewhat outdated with the new schools of thought on eschatology. I would recommend the book to any student of prophecy."
4,Things to Come--but still the same book,"The point of this review is that any version of Things to Come, at least from 1958 to 1980, the version in front of me, is the same text reprinted.Hey, you wouldn't be looking for ""Things to Come"" if you didn't like it. This is 633 detailed pages discussing Biblical prophecy by topic and in detail from those positions which J Dwight Pentecost has come to represent. Yes, this was his doctoral research when he was just starting out, turned into a book and still selling more than 50 years later (as he is also still teaching, as I write!)"
5,A Blessing,This is a very informative book. It helped my understanding of end times prophesy. This is a difficult subject to understand from just the bible but you have to be very careful where you get information from. This is an excellent source.
1,Makes a Nice Door Stop!,"If you need a new door stop OR a class Dispensational reference guide to eschatology, then Pentecost will do the job.If you are looking for eschatology that's faithful to the history of redemption, better to look elsewhere.Ironically, there's more good eschatology in Acts via the *real* Pentecost than J.D. Pentecost's understanding of Acts!!"
1,Not what we ordered,"I too received the Sassy brand, rather than what is pictured and advertised, as I was moving too fast to read the feedback. One star (ideally, less). This MUST be remedied."
5,Love the bags,"These mesh bags have been great for starting my baby on solids, introducing new fruits, and teething! She loves to chew on the bag, and the handle is perfect for tiny hands. The bags do need to be cleaned immediately, and they are a little tricky to get banana out of. I found I had to change them out frequently with banana use, but they are cheap so it works!"
4,USEFUL BUT NOT PERFECT,"This book has been written in a completely different and useful methode,therefore you can find an extremely useful charts and explanations and exercises, but the problem is that it does not have the answer key so you can not use it as an independent material. I suggest that an answer key to be included in the next edition."
4,"toefl.grammer , writing and speaking","my name Ahmed Askar abdi.Iam writing befor one massage ,so i want one book of english.so i have receaving your massage and thank. but i want tu seny me as soon as posible.next book you have tell me.excuse me my poor english"
1,"Sorry, Easier isnt better...","...I didn't have to tell you that though. They don't work at all, maybe one shade of whitening if you are lucky. I use whitestrips frequently to maintain white teeth. I decided to try this, no results. I am using whitestrips premium as I type this to make up for the no whitening. Oh well, they have a satisfaction guarentee, just keep[ the invoice!"
3,Neither interesting nor inspirational,"While I can't find too much fault with any of the information written in this book, many of the examples are rather poor. Why the Nick Jr. family of logos should be in the same book as some lame Cal Arts poster is beyond me; probably just simple nepotism.It's fun to flip through, but you aren't likely to learn much unless you have no design experience whatsoever, and there really aren't even any ""wow, that's really cool looking"" moments, either. The only use I can think of for it is educating clients who think logos are things you obtain through contests and craigslist ads."
1,Would not recommend,"Although the novel covers some interesting aspects, it fails to captivate its audience. Its barbaric and at times childish remarks fall short of what a good author should provide for his readers.AVOID THIS BOOK."
5,A Classic Tale of High Adventure!,"This is a great Scottish novel, with all of the lovely scenery and steadfast heroes desired in this type of book. Even a bit of the Gaelic! I love the tragic character of Helen McGregor, and the classic brutal honor of Robert Roy.The scottish scenary is a vital character. I read this book when I was living in Glasgow, and the descriptions of the city's early days were amazing. I also fell in love with Loch Lomand.Modern readers be warned! This book was written in 1817, when attention spans were longer. The pace is slow, and the story takes awhile to unfold.I was riveted by this book and I highly recommend it"
5,Soulful,"Not only is this CD addictive, it has something to say. It's not pointless pop marketed to make money. When India Arie sings, she has a reason and a rhyme to it. She has a point. Her music is amazing, and it touches your soul deeper than you thought possible. I had heard Video and loved the song, but not enough to go out and purchase the CD. A friend of mine bought it for me for Christmas, and I was blown away. It's soft, chill-out music that makes you think. Highly recommended, even for people (like me) who preferring harder, even poppier music."
5,"Soulful, smart and seven Grammy nominations!","I bought India Arie's cd after seeing the video for the single ""Video"". While people were going wild about Alicia Keys (who is wonderful, as well), I wondered why no one was paying attention to this talented singer. Thankfully, with the seven Grammy nominations she received, this deserving talent is getting some recognition. Her voice reminds me of a little of Whitney Houston's and her sound is a little like Sade but with a twist of originality that makes her unique. Her music is a nice simple blend of jazz and R & B and this mellow cd is great listening. If you like the sound of Sade, or Alicia Keys, or just really good music, give this cd a try."
4,Gorgeous stuff.,"I also listened to the interview with Arie on NPR - thought ""Video"" was really refreshing. Having spun through it a number of times now, the song that keeps me hittin' 'replay' is ""Ready for Love"" - strong writing, music keeps pulling at you like an undertow, builds to a crash. My favorite lines so far:""Lately I've been thinkin' maybe you're not ready for me Maybe you think I need to learn maturity They say watch what you ask for, 'cuz you might receive...""The couple of songs where she lists her musical inspirations/ancestors got annoying on multiple plays. But a gorgeous CD, reminds me of Des'ree's first offering."
4,Good debut,"from a talented young lady. This is one of the best soul albums of the last few years. Her voice is really smoothing and she's a good lyricist. It's a great feel-good record, she seems like such a positive and sweet girl. Everytime I'm feeling down this is one of the best albums to put on to make me will better. ""Video"", ""Strenght, courage and Wisdom"", and the others always put a smile on my face. Another really well-made song is ""Ready for love"". The cd has it highs and lows,but overall it's a made-well album."
3,Great tracks but the album is not complete,"This is a very good album. i am in love with VIDEo and the music behind BROWN SKIN, but it just falls short in some places. The lyrics sometimes are great but then fall off on other tracks. India shines on her more up-tempo songs. the slow stuff needs work. Great to listen to but not a heavy rotation CD."
3,Calgon- Take Me Away!,"Literally, please take me away! I bought this CD with the impression that it would uplift my soul and bring me to a higher place while filling me with inner peace. Well, it didn't.Don't get me wrong- ""Video"" is a great song, but unfortunately that was the only song worth repeating. The rest of the CD is almost a little boring. I guess it's just not what I was expecting. It reminds me of Tracy Chapman, not too many catchy lyrics, down and boring beats, and not much fun.So, if you are looking for something that you can put in your CD player and sing along to like it's nobody business, then this is probably not the CD for you. Well, it wasn't for me at least."
3,Nice CD - very mellow,"I enjoyed the album as a whole. I like some of the songs a lot more than others, but that is par for the course with most CDs."
5,Wonderful,"Greetings,What a honor to have been able to see her live. It's just her and the guitar. She brings somthing to the music industry that is undeserving. When you listen to her you feel like you are in a zone somewhere surrounded with nature, close to God."
3,"not a big shot, but...","... still better than many others. India.Arie doesn't even come near Jill Scott or Erykah Badu on her first album, but still she's somehow not mainstream. She has a nice, warm, soft voice, and at first makes you listen up, but then the songs sound pretty much the same, a bit like ""neither fish nor flesh"". So this is three stars to me. Still, she has a lot of potential, so maybe next album ...?"
2,"Interesting concept, with boring characters and no plot.","Walden Two is a book that could have been great but suffers from one flaw: it's boring!! The book reads like a lecture with occasional debate. Skinner definately intrigues me with his thoughts on behavioral engineering, and the concept of a utopian society in the midst of present day society is very intriguing. However, there is basically no plot and very little character development in this book and thus it suffers. 1984 doesn't read like a blue print discussing the society instead it's a story about Winston and Julia through which we learn about the society. I wish Walden Two was less of lecture and more of a story."
3,good overall,"the book came in an acceptable condition, the description should have been a little more detailed as to how old this book really was but overall shipping was quick and the book was only 4$, so I cant complain"
5,Impacted my life. 2nd Greatest book ever read,"If you're into Utopias, Philosophy, psychology, or any hybrid of the two, Walden II is for you. As a teenager it enlightened me on the pinpoints of teenage behavioralism. A must read for the intelligant human being. The productive member or society. But beware you may come back a changed man"
4,"A sincere, mildly rocking album","It starts out quite soft and heavy with the first song. I wish it would have been extended. The rest is heartfelt. Some of the songs bite, in a subdued way. Still contained.She sort of sounds like Alanis Morrisette at parts."
5,Love it!,"This is the first Ginny Owens CD I bought and she has a fan for life! My favorite song is ""If You Want Me To"". It touched me when I heard it on the radio. With the CD, I was able to read about her and watch the video clips on the computer and learned the background of the song. It is beautiful!!"
5,ok i'll talk abit bout it,"Carl has a great voice! i enjoy this album alot.My Fav Song is ""My First Love"". ""Rebound"" and ""The Baby Maker"" are also good. I heard ""She Is"" featurin LL to much but it was a great song.good work Mr. Thomas"
2,It's okay if you are into polyster.,"I'm sure there are advantages to polyester - but I am not a fan of it. I think it doesn't ""breathe"" well or feel good on your skin - this top falls into that category. If you like polyester, this is a nice roomy top. I do think it looks a little bit cheap - but it's not horrible - and, again, the fit is good."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on!,Quite possibly the worst book ever written. Starting with the prologue where Oliver North blames everything but natural disasters on liberals to the main body of the book that reinforces the notion that generals should really stick to military matters and leave issues of a political and diplomatic nature to the politicians. Truly poor selection...I'm glad McInerney is in no position to make the decisions he advocates in the book!
2,doesn't live up to the Corona name,"I bought this ratcheting lopper expecting it to perform well given the Corona brand name, but it's a disappointment. The problem is that the ratcheting mechanism frequently does not kick in. I have used other larger ratcheting loppers before and even the cheap ones work better than this mini one. Here is what it does: The lopper makes a bite into a very thick branch and it doesn't have enough leverage to make the cut all the way through. This is perfectly normal for a ratcheting lopper. What is not normal is that when I open the lopper handles again, the ratchet frequently does not advance to the next step. The result is the leverage does not increase as it should and the lopper just gets stuck on a branch that it can't cut through. Sometimes it works, but often it doesn't."
3,"fast read, many written songs",Not too much about his home life. Alot about what he wished he could have done to save the world. Many of his songs written out which I thought was good in case a person didn't know all the words to his song. An awful lot was written about many political issues and how he felt about them. It was a good fast read book for anyone who was interested in John Denver like I was.
4,"Saw the Movie, Read the Book","This autobiography, completed of course before his tragic air crash death, gives a good summary of John's struggles with family, spouse, fame and environmental concerns. He seems quite honest and not overly puffed up. Appears also to be an accurate portrayal of his romantic but troubled relationship with his first spouse, Annie, their two adopted children and his biological child from his brief second marriage. Book was reasonably translated into the made for television movie, ""The John Denver Story"", and it was the film which led me to the book. Overall he comes across as a humble, sincere guy with a lot of talent and strong social/environmental convictions with a difficult relationship to a demanding dad which was eventually healed. Apparently a brother took some exception to the portrayal of the dad, I believe particularly in the film."
2,It could have been better,Oddly enough I found myself owning two copies of this book. And while I read it cover to cover I wish it had more about JD:the man and his music and his feelings. It just didn't seem to cover enough of what I was looking for. Sherianna
2,"Some good hacks, not a lot of PHP","The book has a lot of hacks, to be sure! And if the author presents a hack that EXACTLY fits your need, then the book is worth a read (not a buy). WAY too often, though, the 'hack' is ""How to use some other, non-PHP product to get PHP to do what you want.""The book is like bizarre combination of ""Look what I can do!"" and ""Buy this book where I tell you, quickly and poorly, how to use someone else's product that really IS great!""The book is barely worth checking out at the library."
5,Great guide book!!,"Just returned from a 7 day visit to Prague. This book went with us everywhere!! We did 2 of the suggested ""walks."" Loved that it told you what to see if you had an hour or if you had an afternoon.Everyone of the restaurants we visited based on LP's recommedation was amazing. (We're thinking of buying the LP guide to NYC so we know where to grab a bite after work).We also took along the Eye Witness guide when we went to major spots -- Prague Castle, Charles Bridge -- because it had more pictures.Will buy a LP guide for next overseas travel!!"
2,"Lots of mistakes, not thorough","If you're looking for bars in Prague, this is the guide for you. If you want a thorough review of where to stay, and what there is to see in Prague as far as museums and monuments, try the Discovery Channel guides or Marco Polo."
5,very useful,"This was a great guide for Prague. It provided me with maps of places like St Vitus' Cathedral and Prague Castle that were hard to come by even at the ticket office for these places. I have limited experience with other guidebooks, but I have always found the Lonely Planet series to be well-written and particularly useful for finding a range of services delineated by cost. So you can find the cheap stuff as well as the expensive stuff. Historical details are interspersed throughout the books, too, which can make for a more in-depth travel experience. This particular guide was written in a personable style and was full of useful information. It greatly enhanced my trip."
2,Did as expected... for a couple days anyway.,"I used this on a dowel rod on a rocking chair to stop it from squeaking. It did wonderful for the first couple days, but quickly dried out. I feel I could have poured water or WD40 on the same area and got the same result. No lasting effects. It has no odor and seeps right into the area applied. Very easy to use, but not a long term solution."
1,"Few purses, Many Vanity Bags","I have a large collection of vintage handbags which a local museum wanted to display, so I needed to establish values. This book was of no help as it is mostly vanity bags. I ordered this book because the other books listed for sale were too old to have current prices. I am still seeking a CURRENT book with prices to value my 100+ purses! Do not buy this book unless you want to learn more about vanity bags, as there is next to nothing about vintage (beaded or mesh) purses in this book!"
1,What Happened?,"I bought 2 of these mugs. Can't tell you when this happened, but one day I heated up my coffee, reached into the microwave and OUCH!!! The handle was so hot, I couldn't pull the mug out. I've used a low-wattage, as well as a high-wattage oven, and the same thing took place. Now, my son uses them for cold drinks. They are useless to me."
4,Condensed television,"TV'S READER'S DIGEST ran for two seasons on the ABC network. A total of 64 episodes aired between January 17, 1955 and July 9, 1956. The stories presented in this half-hour drama series were adapted from Reader's Digest magazine.The two examples presented here are a well-documented murder case and a story shrouded in historical myth. ""America's First Great Lady"" addresses the legend of Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas. ""Britain's Most Baffling Murder"" is about a meek man accused of killing his overbearing wife.Included below are episode numbers, season, airdate and cast members.(#10) America's First Great Lady (S.1, 3/21/55) - Richard Ney/John Stephenson/Gloria Talbott/Hugh Reilly (host)(#57) Britain's Most Baffling Murder Case (S.2, 5/14/56) - Anthony Eustrel/Rhys Williams/Gene Raymond (host)"
2,The book is racist and Americentric,"Overall the book is useful, but the part of estereotipos is very racist. Most parts of the book reflect American perspectives on issues, which is not surprising as it was written by Americans. I would not recommend the book unless you are American and/or racist."
1,Not what I wanted,"Got the wrong item, sent it back and still haven't received my money back. Not pleased with their service. Never again"
1,Horrible Digital Conversion!,"This was a favorite movie when I was a child and was intrigued enough to buy it as a digital download...but...the conversion from film to digital is completely unacceptable. If owning is a must, rent first to see the low quality for yourself. If I could, I'd love to get my $5 back!! Disappointing to say the least."
1,Poor quality construction,"This fell apart almost from the first moment one of our cats tried to scratch it. The post separated from the bottom, exposing a couple of long staples that were all that was used to attach it to the plastic coupling. I suppose you get what you pay for... I can probably glue it or put some staples in myself; but I was not expecting any assembly for this product."
2,Cats have ignored this scratching post...,"I'm probably going to toss this scratching post. When I put it together I didn't care for the look of it. It was easy to put together, but the seems of the carpeting look pretty cheap. The final decision has been made by my two cats, neither of whom have scrached it even once. The seem to prefer the cardboard and jute scratchers but have used carpeted ones in the past. Something about this one just doesn't turn them on. I think I heard one of them tell the post, ""It's not you, it's me."" You know what that means."
2,Flexrake Deluxe Carpet Scratch Post,"Carpet on the Flexrake was okay, the top have was fine, but that was all that came with it. There was no platform on which to place the post. I wish the company that makes this item would not show a platform in the ad, when there is no platform when the item arrives. I sent the first one back because I thought this was an oversight, but surprise! surprise! The second one arrived and it was only the post. What's up with that? Is it just me, or is this false advertising?"
1,Gary Dobry Can Not Write!,It's clear from Dobry's art he uses a projector to produce what is on the canvas. When it comes to writing he can't do this. His writing is very trite and old hat. Don't waste your money. Dobry is neither Bukowski or Miller.
2,Swing and a Miss,"I bought this album thinking it would be Klaus Nomi redux. Unfortunately, while Cordeiro has a lovely voice he hasn't the imagination of Nomi. These songs are done ""straight up"" (no pun intended) with no apparent hint of irony or subversiveness. It's entirely too bad... what could have been a camp extravaganza is just lame, warmed over disco."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with the quality of this changing pad cover. It ripped after only a couple washes (and I washed it in cold water and the low heat cycle in the dryer), and was prone to snagging and got strings hanging all over it. Simmons is generally a reputable company, so I was surprised that it didn't hold up well. My son is only a few weeks old, and I am already having to buy a new cover, but I certainly won't be purchasing this one again!"
5,Divinly Inspired work of art,"I have had this book for two years now and am still discovering deep truths everytime I read it. This book is not intended for those who choose to academicaly disect it, but soley for people who have a deep desire for profound life changing spiritual truths ( anyone else who trys to understand this book will be very confused). My hats off to Thomas Cleary for his unprecedented efforts in undertaking such a complex task translating so flawlessly this subject."
3,School,Needed it for a college class. Otherwise I would not have purchased it. hardly used it but needed to purchase it.
1,Missled!!!!!!,"I was expecting a Unicel C-7656 Replacement Filter Cartridge (which replaces the Hayward CX500RE). Instead I received a no-name product which replaces the replacement filter ... I am not happy at all!!!! I already have the Unicel C-7656 filter, which works just fine .... I do not know if the no-name filter is OK or not, but I have used other filters which have NOT performed acceptably."
4,Good read,I liked it. I like Linda Howard and thought this one was good as well. Not her best but a good read.
2,It was definitely not one of Linda's best,I have read many books of Linda Howard and I must say I was rather disappointed with this one.
1,Beware!!!!!!!,"Well, well, well... once again, like someone else put in his review, Armenians are stealing Georgian heritage. Perhaps they do not have as monumental and beautiful church as this Svetitskhoveli Cathedral is (I've never seen Armenian churches and have no opinion about them), but why should they steal one from Georgia and put on their CD? I smell something fishy here. And who knows what songs are on this CD? Can church-stealers be trusted????????? BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,50 BUCKS SAYS SHE'LL LET ME IN!,"this pendulum contains the song ""50 Bucks"" by ICP its a pretty phat song I like it! You should buy this!"
1,"Way too slow, and frustrating!","I purchased this program and also got Photoshop Elements. I wanted to evaluate which is the best for my purposes--mainly adjusting and tweaking my digital camera's photos. I got up and running right away with Elements, but Paint Shop Pro took a long time to start up, and then I was frustrated trying to understand the program. The booklet that came with it was of course useless. Everything went slowly and I soon became frustrated. Others reviewers apparently liked it but it did nothing for me. I am returning it to Amazon for a refund. I'll stick with Photoshop Elements."
1,Did not pass QA. Buggy and Slow.,"I have been a fan of PSP since version 5. For a fraction of the price it does 99% of what Photoshop can do, and the user interface is easier and more intuitive. HOWEVER, this new version is a huge step backwards, and it's a real shame. Whatever enhancements may have been added to the program are irrelevant, as its bugs and _insanely_ slow performance make it essentially un-usable. Basic operations, like opening the browser view, take forever. I've tried it out on two different systems, a Pentium 4 with 1G RAM and an Athlon X2-64 with 2G of RAM, and several times I've seen it completely hang after only a few minutes of use. Stick with PSP 9 or 10 and you will be much happier."
2,"5 stars for Henry David Thoreau, 0 for Bill McKibben","This book would be a good presentation of the classic Walden if you tore out the introduction by Bill Kibben. While the annotations are helpful, the introduction is over the top, making out Thoreau as an environmentalist and climate change advocate. Totally self-serving on the part of McKibben. Thoreau was certainly a thinker outside the box, but an environmentalist he was not. To suppose that in this day he would be an advocate of climate change is laughable. Look for a true copy of Walden without the garbage added."
5,Stunning edition!,"I will not comment on Walden itself, because that is a matter whether you accept it to be a classic or not. My review is on the quality of this edition, which is superb. The book is a pleasure to hold--the paper is heavy and smooth, the print is sharp, and the award-winning illustrations are an added bonus. Unlike the other hardcover bindings out there, this is not an annotated version, so you get a pure uncluttered copy of the masterwork itself."
5,Enlightening,When reading Walden i realized that not only is his writing insightful on the aspects of life in his time. But it transcends generations. I have found only a few other pieces of writing that coincide with my thoughts besides this book. His thoughts on life's essentials and how needless they can be gives such a different view than other pieces of literature. I was especially taken by how he views the importance of education. I agree fully with the fact that experience can teach us so much more than formal schooling. Over all the book was a beautiful representation of a better way to view life than what modern culture teaches.
4,A book of true personal value.,"Walden is really an exposition of Thoreau's way of viewing life. Thoreau says there is more to life than posessions and money, that, as difficult as it is to accumulate posessions and to earn wealth, it is much much more difficult to rid one's self of them! A statement/concept that is worthy of contemplation.Walden will take you away in to your own ""walden"", if that is where you would like to be, and, if so, then you, as I, will enjoy the book very much. I rated it as a four star (out of five), only, because I could not choose 4.5 stars. On my personal scale, in order to receive a 5 star rating, a book has to move me with the intensity of a paradigm shift. It has to offer up concepts that, following a thorough consideration, change my present view of life, world. etc.... Thoreau's Walden comes close on this measure, but falls just a little short.His On civil disobedience, is another work that I reccomend with high regard, slightly more so, even. than Walden."
2,Great classic/ but too expensive here,"I brought this book because I had a class that required it. I got it within 2 weeks so that wasn't bad but I hadn't realized that I paid more for the book here then I would have had I gone to a local store! The back of the book says it's only $2.50. The lowest price I could find on Amazon was $4. I guess that's why people don't have to pay for shipping when they purchase items that exceed $25! (The free mailing gets paid for (at least in this case), with higher book prices.BTW I found out that this book is a free e-book via the web. Next time I'll make sure to check that avenue first."
5,Classic!,A classic for how to simplify one's life. Although the author didn't live there all his life. Highly recommended if not nothing else but the classic prose.
1,Very Hard to Read - Poorly organized,"This book is very hard to read as publisher has put in very small fonts and squeezed way too much text into pages. Feels like book from 19th century when they just invented printing presses.Therefore, the book is hard to read and navigate - don't buy the book from this publisher. Find another book where publisher wasn't so cheap with paper and space."
5,"Quirky, crazy and cunning","I became hooked on Stephanie Plum when a friend gave me the 10th novel in the series for my birthday. I vowed after reading that one that I'd have to start with No 1 and read my way up the list. The first novel, ONE FOR THE MONEY, is a wild, mapcap adventure with Stephanie just learning her craft, hurling herself into trouble with the cop Morelli (whom she just hates to love), and bungling her way into a really blood-curdling duel with a psycho killer. The joy of Evanovich's writing is that it all looks effortless, although we all know she put plenty of art into it.Looking forward to number two, just as soon as Amazon delivers it."
3,Slow start for the series - but enough to keep me interested,"I had been wondering about the Stephanie Plum series and finally got the recommendation needed to give it a try. She is an unlikely bounty hunter, but the desperation for money drove her into the dangereous profession. The latter part of the book brought the suspense and unexpected - just enough to get me to buy the next book. I was hoping for a little intimacy at the end - we will see what the next books bring."
3,Not the best in the series.,This is not one of Janet Evanovich's best books. I have read quite a few of them and will continue to read them. Janet does continue to keep me laughing with her Stephanie Plum novels.
5,GREAT,I have fallen in love with Janet Evanovich as an auther and Stephanie Plum as a character. Well written and funny.
5,Plum #1,"As for the book. I love it. I wanted the unabridged version of the book, and thats what I thought I was getting. But the story line is fab."
5,Hilarious,This is a great mystery series with Stephanie Plum. The characters are well drawn and compelling as is our heroine. And clearly she has a sense of humor about herself and the rest of the world in which she lives. My husband can always tell when I'm reading a Stephanie Plum because I can't help but laugh out loud!
5,Did it Backwards!,"I did this backwards - started with ""Hard Eight"" and loved it, so worked my way backwards to the first. Evanovich is great at giving the reader quirky characters. True, she does remind me of Grafton, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she can deliver a book that's entertaining and fun to read. Now onto the latest!"
3,It's a start...,"One For The Money is all about Stephanie Plum's entrance into the world of bounty hunting. The jersey girl has been unemployed for six months and has ran out of things to hawk to pay for hamster food & beer. She finds herself hitting up her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsmen, for work... and lands the file for former vice-cop Joe Morelli, wanted for murder. Morelli also managed to get Stephanie's ""cannoli"" back in high school, so this jumper chase is more than just business, it's personal.After some quick training from the king of bounty hunting in Trenton, Ranger, Stephanie is out and about trying to catch Morelli and investigate his case. Unfortunately, Morelli keeps slipping between Stephanies fingers... a reoccurring incident that got tiring and hard to believe. The whole first half of the book was tedious, which can be expected from the first in a series. Fortunately the second half got better, and made the whole book worth reading - including the rest of the series."
2,Letdown! A Scooby Doo style mstery,"I gave this book two stars because it was semi-entertaining, in a bad movie sort of way. It is not the hilarious book other posts have claimed. Maybe you have to be from Jersey to get it. It is generally predictable and unexciting. It is the equivalent of watching a movie made for the USA channel - same tired tv movie plot. My title refers to the Scooby Doo style ending. I'm sure anyone could find a better book than this. This was my first and last from Evanovich!"
3,Okay but not as good as expected,"From all of the great reviews, I expected this to be much better than it actually turned out to be. It was a quick read, but I think I'll read another book instead of continuing with this series."
2,"""One For the Money""",I tried reading this book because i was always hearing how great it was. I could not wait to stop. This book is written for a fifth grader and is horrible. The plot would never happen and the violence is unrealistic and does not go with the rest of the story.
3,For the beach in a cloudy day,"Hilarious crime fiction introducing Stephanie Plum, a very likeable character who is the star and heroine, the story is told by Stephanie in first person. Plot quick and simple with coming events one after another and fast resolution. This book will not offer you a whodunit, nor a true crime with grizzly discoveries nor impressive twist and turns. Every other word Stephanie is cracking a joke. If you want to laugh out loud for a while go ahead and get it, if you want to think, better look for other authors."
