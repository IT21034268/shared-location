2,high carbon,"This knife is very sharp, and reasonably priced, however it is unusually susceptible to rust."
1,Disappointed Christian,"I was surprised to see this book in the mail. At first, I was very interested because I am currently teaching a unit on the Holocaust and was hoping to add to my knowledge of Judaism and stories of survival. I read the first story and quickly realized that this is a book meant to convert Jews to Christianity. The first red flag was the mention of ""The 700 Club"". People should worship in whichever way they see fit, and everyone else should just butt out!"
1,Complete Trash,"Throw it in the garbage, don't even bother opening it.It pretends to be ""informative"", while really it's an attempt at converting Jews to Christianity."
5,Super,"Quick, powerful read of real people who show the 'before and after' effects of learning truth."
1,A difficult decision,"Came in the mail. For free. I cannot decide if this book should go straight to the trash or whether I should recycle it, as I ordinarily would."
3,"No size options, but they ship different sizes!","I ordered one of these for a family member who has a herniated disc. It got rave reviews, so I ordered another for myself. I placed the same order for the same product, but the second one is ENORMOUS! I'd have to be six feet tall to use it. Should be able to select a size when ordering."
2,"OK concept, but too many pieces to loose.","The concept of a zip up, fabric, almost puzzle-like alphabet book is great. But, there are so many pieces to loose. They will replace the pieces, but it is still a hassle. Definitely for age 3 and up."
1,Numbers & Your Fortune,"I don't know what the laws concerning plagarism are in India, or if Mr. Johari writes under other names, but this book 'borrows' extravagantly from Mahan vir Tulli's book 'Numbers & Your Fortune,' which was published in 1984. I was shocked when I found Mr. Tulli's work - since I had read Mr. Johari's book & studied it for a few years, thinking it quite extraordinary - and then recognized the unmistakable phrases & sentences which I had believed to be Mr. Johari's. Mr. Tulli's information is quite thought provoking and well worth seeking out; Mr. Johari's presentation - lamentable."
1,Rubbish,"Totally fake and pointless material. Its obvious reading this book, that it has absolutely nothing of substance in it. Total waste of time. Not worth buying."
5,"Quality, bulk shavings","These come delivered in a giant thick paper bag and are fairly well compressed. When you start pulling the shavings out, they will fluff up and definitely fill a lot more space than the package they are shipped in. I have no complaints about these and they cost a fraction of what you would pay at pet stores or repeatedly buying smaller quantities. My only gripe is Amazon raised the price more than 60% after the first time I bought this... I should have bought more with my first order! The newer price is still reasonably competitive, but may inspire me to double check other options before I purchase again."
2,decent but price has gone up!,"ok bedding,although very inconsistnet and the bag always arrives broken or torn inside a huge box. also why has the price gone up?? it used to be $21.99 now $27.98?? will not buy again unless price drops"
2,Haven't even received the item,I know that when I receive the product I am going to love it. It is perfect and exactly what I need for my guinea pigs. But I ordered this product wednesday and normally things ship within 24 hours with amazon. But this still says shipping soon. I would like to receive the item asap because I would like more bedding so the cage can be more full but I don't know when I will receive it. Probably not by the dates that it should come by. Is that what super saver shipping is. You order the product and it doesn't ship for a long time?
2,My opinion of Taming Our Monkey Mind by Phyllis Krystal,"The book wasn't what I expected. It really doesn't define ""monkey mind."" but is more of a memoir of a trip to India and experiences and people there. If I had known this, I wouldn't have ordered it. I was looking for a book which would help me explain ""monkey mind"" to my class on stress management. It didn't fill the bill."
3,musical drama,"Few directors have dared to shoot a drama in which every single line is sung by the actors. The result is somewhat surprising at first but is hardly noticeable after 10-20 minutes. The storyline was probably very dary in the 60's (teen pregnancy), but has aged a little bit since. It is nevertheless a charming movie with a young and beautiful catherine deneuve."
5,GORGEOUS,"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is quite simply one of the most gorgeous movies ever made -- not only are the visuals eye-popping with day-glo 60s fashion and color, and the French settings awash with sumptuous, tactile beauty -- the cast is stunningly beautiful, every one of them -- and the score, by Michel Legrand, gives the movie a swirlingly romantic narrative that is thru-sung, with no spoken dialog. It is intoxicating, to say the least. And the simple, melancholy story grabs and clutches at your throat, since it has the sting of truth. This is one of those films that makes you so glad that movies were invented."
4,Works well,"Couldn't have installed an after-market stereo without this. Works pretty well. Unfortunately I had to install it upside-down since I drive an '05 Ford Explorer. But I didn't need to use the extra braces at all, so it was nice not having to hassle with those. And having the extra space above my stereo really isn't all that bad, just different than I was expecting."
1,place settings,"While the examples of place settings are lovely, they are not for me - interested in ""busier"" patterns. country-type patterns Thanks"
4,Good deal,"Stearns makes good life jackets and these are good, especially for the price. Adjustable straps, fit snug and I totally recommend this product."
3,Too Small,"Although listed as ""Large"" the vest is really ""medium"" and requires adjustments...but even then the lower part of the vest ended way above my belly button.I am 6 foot tall 185 pound person...not a giant at allGill"
2,"Good cinematography, bad plot","The visuals in this picture were very well done, as well as the direction but there was no plot. None at all. Just two people acting very childish and stupid. If that was supposed to be the point,well it was totally lost on me. There was no real growth in the characters. They seemed just as shallow in the end as they were in the beginning. They really didn't deserve to get together in the end, I was totally bored and unmoved."
5,I've got a Jones for Love Jones,This is one of my absolute favorites and if you have never seen you must. A beautiful love story that shows you love never fails! Lorenz Tate and Nia Long were excellent and Isiah Washington delivers a memorable performance as Savon. Loved the movie so much I even named my son SaVaughn.
5,Excellent,One of my favorite movie and its my pleasure to add it to my collection of favorites. It arrive very fast and in Excellent condition. Thank you very much for your prompt service.
3,Very scratched at the end.,"The DVD played good up until the end. So, I was unable to view how the movie ended. Thats it!"
5,"my daughter loved it as a child, and now my grandson",This is a timeless wonderful book. Helps to establish early the bed time routine in a cute and fun way.
1,A Miserable Liar,"Not unlike the rest of randal's work, on iraq and lebanon, this smacks of the same obsolete 3rd worldist drivel that has become a trademark of Randal's pseudo-scholarship; always straining itself to always depict muslims and arabs in the image of helpless victims, who have no say in the misfortunes that befall them. ""Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa bil laah""!!. This is not to mention Randal's simplistic understanding of Islamic culture and Muslim teachings.I retched with every turn of the page! The level of cluelessness and immaturity of this author are just mind boggling.I put him in the same category as his partner in asinine irresponsible journalism, Robert Fisk; both credulous, hypocritical, and mendacious propagandists. Shame on you Randy for persisting in disgracing the trade!"
1,False Advertising,"I would not order from this company. They falsely advertise and their product is small and packaging is ugly. They take way too long to respond to emails and they do not give refunds. I have filed a claim against them because of my unhappiness.I have never had a problem with Amazon before, and I don't want this complaint to reflect other venders.Bubble Bath - Lavender Fields"
2,iTouchless Hands Free 18 gallon,Trash... hmmmm!I took a chance and purchased this item; it did not come in the correct box nor did it have the correct manual. The sensor did not work from the get-go. The bottom piece was almost as thin a foil and it almost looked like it inside bucket from another trash can. It did not appear at all like the picture. It may depend on who you buy it from because there were some other favorable reviews for this item. I wonder which vendor they purchased their's from?
2,High tech isn't always what you expect,Second one I bought and the sensor broke on both of them. The company is good on their warrantee but save some money for shipment.The idea is excellent but the reliability isn't that great. Especially for what you paid for. I will not buy another again.
4,Not the Original but a great alternative!!,"If you don't want to spend an arm and a leg on the original, this is a great alternative. Works like a charm, stainless body. The lid is not silent when opening or closing and you need to use largeer bags with the 18 gal. but well worth it. Also does not come with the base or optional plug, (Not sure if the ones from the original will work - I didn't think they were worth the investment.)but the batteries last as stated!! great with kids and pets."
3,You get what you pay for,If someone or something is warm enough it will set it off. My wife is starting to complain about the false alarms. I have mine mounted underneath the front porch in the corner right below the ceiling and will still get false alarms.
3,Price is right,"This ""alarm"" is a basic device that can alert you to anything that passes through it's beam. I found when set off, it sounds like my wireless doorbell. It does have 2 settings for sound - high and low and has an off switch as well. Other reviews have advised using good batteries that last longer and I agree. . .I may buy additional ones as they are priced reasonably for the quality that they are."
2,Constant False Alarms,"Great idea, but very poor quality. The constant false alarms make it useless. I installed it 3' off the ground, out of direct sunlight. Right now, I have it on my desk, pointing at a wall 1 FOOT away and it is still continuously going off.Piece of junk."
3,worth the money,"because it was so cheaply priced it was worth the money. HOwever, no matter how i set it up it still give false alarms, which are very annoying. People around here are using them to scare away deer from the garden, not sure if that is working or not. they put the alarm sensor and the alarm at the garden."
4,It works,"I purchased this unit to be used for a general purpose room-entry alarm system. The sensing unit has a round shaped bottom. It will not sit on a flat surface very well...it rocks around. I do not understand why it does not have a flat bottom, in case, someone wants to place on a flat surface. If you mount it on a wall, no problem. Otherwise, it works as advertised. Also, the battery type (C size) used in the receiving uint are not as cost-effective D size. D size batteries cost the same as C size, but, last twice as long. Yes, the D size is larger, but, still a better choice."
3,Driveway Patrol Sensor,This product works fine and it does what it is suppose to do but I would have liked to have had the ability to set the sensitivity on it because of it being to sensitive. The alarm would go off all the time for no apparent reason or because of the wind blowing something in front of it. I would end up having a lot of false alarms and so I stopped using it.
5,Hear who's comeing through the door,"This product is good for a door chime.We use it in our store, it works great."
2,Terrible range in only light brush,"This thing would not work ten feet in light tree brush. I had to take an old remote control antenna used for a toy car and wire it up to the base unit, then pull the inner antenna out of the detector through a hole I drilled before hot gluing around it to seal out moisture. Now it works as advertised. I gave it two stars because I could at least work with it. But unless you want to go through what I went through or you just like returning stuff, do not buy."
4,Does what it is supposed to,"At first I put the batteries and nothing happened. I was putting it back in the box, a friend came over, told him about it, we read the instructions and noticed they warned you about a lapse of time after you put the batteries in both devices. Warning should be more visual. Once product was working it was just a matter of finding the right place to cover the most area. Very happy with it because it does exactly what it says. Little loud,"
2,it works just not well,"good news: it works.bad news: it works too much.anything at all will trip it and make it go off. If a bug flies in front of it, it's going off. If it's windy outside, it will see the trees moving and it will go off. If it's raining, that will make it go off. Snowing, that will make it go off.Literally, one slightly breezy day it was going off every 5 seconds until I turned it off.So, I don't use them anymore.Though they might be useful indoors maybe in the garage or something where there's no movement, to let me know if there's an intruder or something."
1,poor signal,this alarm system does not preform very. in other wards very poor. its less than one hundred feet.the sigal is very poor.
1,Consumer ripoff,"Bought the Driveway Patrol and had nothing but problems with it. It constantly went off, no matter how many times I moved it around. Also, when a car drove INTO the driveway sometimes it wouldn't go off!!! Talked to the Telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back, they replaced it free. However, it worked just as bad as the first one. NOW they refuse to refund my money!! This product is an absolute ripoff and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars!! I suggest you beware of any other products you might want from Telebrands."
1,Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver kit,"It didn't work. Buying two, I used one three nights. When I set it up with new batteries, it worked when I checked it out.When I placed it in the drive, it never alerted me when someone was coming in...or going out.Under the circumstances I did not try the second unit."
4,Driveway sensor,"The product meets the needs I bought it for. I have a 300 foot long driveway and like knowing when someone has walked or driven in since trees obstruct a direct view of the gate area. Satisfied customer, Al Richards"
3,Second time it worked,First delivery unit yielded a range of only 25-30 feet. Replacement unit works fine- range of about 60 feet not 300 as advertised.
1,This is a toy,"It works for the first week, on and off for the second week, totaly dead for the third week. And it uses expnsive C batteries. Give it to you children to put it in the play house. That is where it should be."
2,Not waterproff,I had one it worked for a few months. It was very loud ended up placing the receiver outside on the porch. It was so loud we could hear it inside. It finaly went out after watter got in it. opened it up and discovered that even tho it has a seal the back where the screw mounting hole is not sealed. Worked for a few more months after drying it out and then quit. Do not place anywhere where it can rain on it. Suggest under a eve or inside some type of box. Its not rated for outdoor use.
3,"Works, but buyer beware","I bought one of these a year ago. It stopped working after 14 months.When it worked, it worked well. Few false alarms (mostly because of the sun hitting it at a certain angle).For the money, I suppose it's worth it, but not much more!"
1,drive way patrol,save your batery's this product is a rip off.i have bought two and they do not work correctly.its to costly to send back:alf-7
4,Effective but needs a muffler...,"I found the distance and sensitivity to be great for this driveway device. Its actually going to be used to monitor elderly parents with dementia.There are a couple of drawbacks but both easily overcome.First, the sensor itself runs off a 9 volt battery which is cumbersome so I converted this over to a wall adapter.Second, the receiver is too loud, as many others have pointed out but this can be corrected by disassembling the receiver and taping over the speaker. After reassembling, tape over the slots where the sound comes out.Other than those two items, I would purchase this again."
2,Category: Disposable,"Great buy if you only need it for 3 weeks. I live in temperate zone, bought this before last winter, housed it in a plastic planter with a hole cut out for sensor to shield it from the rain and snow. It worked nicely for a few weeks, then for some reason it stopped working. Checked the batteries and they were fine. Repositioned sensor, and it worked fine for another week or two. Kept repositioning, replaced batteries...long story short- This thing caused me a lot of frustration and it didn't survive the winter. Guess I got my money's worth, but still disappointed. Will be buying a real driveway alarm soon."
1,Did not work,"I ordered this product and it arrived promptly.....however, I was bummed that the thing did not work. I took it down to Radio Shack to get a DC power adapter. The employee tested one out that he thought fit and it did not work. He said, ""This thing works right? I told him I did not know, I just got it and never had a battery in it. He loaded three C batteries and it still did not work. It was a defective unit. Contacting Amazon to return this...."
1,Don't waste your time on this.,"Maybe you'll get lucky and get one that works. I didn't.The light on the sensor comes on any time it detects anything. However, the only way to get the receiver to respond is by turning it off then back on, AND, this doesn't even work most of the time. I tried a couple sets of batteries in each unit, and got the chime to sound a total of two times.The signal is not detected through any wall either.I'd send it back, but it's not worth my time. Thankfully it was cheap."
4,Just what I needed for alert me when someone gets close to my driveway or anywhere you need warning alert A+A+A+,Just what I needed for alert me when someone gets close to my driveway or anywhere you need warning alert A+A+A+
1,Driveway Patrol,"I purchased this as a replacement to an old one that lasted a little over 5 years. When I received this one the receiver is not working. Luckily I was able to pair it with the old one that I had. The old one I had wore out the sensor so when I matched up the old receiver and the new sensor it worked just fine. Otherwise it would not have been worth the money to return it and get another set. I really loved this Driveway patrol but not sure if I wanted to purchase it from the same place again. I use this outdoors to signal me when someone is coming in to my property --- people, cats, dogs...etc. --- day or night. Paired with my outdoor camera, it is the perfect security solution for people who is home a lot. I can tell whether to come to my door or not before they even ring the bell :-)"
3,Can't change frequency,"yeah, the product is fine, until I told my neighbor to buy one also. I didnt realize the driveway patrol had only one frequency. So every time my neighbor sensor is trip my reciever would go on too.. Wahhhhhh. If your buying this item dont tell your neighbor."
1,"Detects everything, sometimes even cars","This product annoyed the hell out of me. Birds, wind, clouds?, heat? rabbits, deer, insects Cars in the street even set it off It's not really meant to detect just cars, higher priced item that detects heavy objects is what is needed if you are using for driveway monitor - this device did not make it for me."
1,"Don't waste your money, buy The Reporter instead","I bought this a few years ago. At times it worked, but mostly it gave false alarms constantly. I bought the Reporter more than a year ago, and it alarms 99.9% of the time, and I have not had any false alarms. Don't waste your money on this thingCheck it out:Chamberlain Wireless Alert System #RWA-300R"
5,Great Item - Many Other Uses -,"This unit has many uses other than as a signal device for the driveway. Its uses are only limited by the imagination of the purchaser. The product is built well, & the company selling this device is a pleasure to deal with. Overall, very satisfied."
1,"Amazon ""Drivway Patrol"" review","I bought and tried two of these. Both would not activate alarm if inside house. The distance from sender was less than150 feet. Worked fine if alarm was om open front porch. Signal could not go through wall or glass. For me ,it was useless."
4,Very sensitive but WORKS WELL!,"It's very sensitive but WORKS WELL! It would be best if this product has an included bracket that can be tilt up, down, or sideways."
1,Waste of money,"Living near the bay as we do, we've had problems with people taking a stroll down our driveway in order to ""just take a look.""Looking around for a solution, I came across this product, and figured for [$], I can't go too wrong.So, does it work? Well, this is an updated review: the alarm goes off without rhyme or reason--sometimes at 2 AM--and often stays on for a minute or so. Very annoying. The unit has been disconnected."
4,Driveway motion sensor,"This product will detect people and cars walking into our driveway. The Two sound level tone is about as loud as a electronic doorbell chime. The device will also sound if Mourning doves, chipmunks, etc. go past the sensor. The cure in the instructions is using tape to cover a portion of the sensor. That cure is a little iffy. A separate sensitivity control would be better. Range for people-sized objects is about 25-30 feet."
5,Not Bad,"I enjoyed this book, as it was action packed, while still leading you through an involving plot. You see the true depths of what Bothans are capable of, when influenced by evil. Not only this, but you also see an extension of the theory proposed in ""The Last Command"": that the Bothans knew all about most of the Imperials secret storage facilities, but never felt like telling anyone else. I'd like to see this explored more deeply in a novel sometime. Anyways, another good Rouge Squadron book/comic."
5,Great DVD set!,"I have been a huge fan of Community since the first episode. I enjoy the sarcastic humor and how it is not afraid to talk about topics like religion and race, like some other people have noted. Since my friends come from all ages and backgrounds, I like that part of the show. I am really enjoying the DVD since every single episode has commentary available! I also like all of the outtakes- they are hilarious. I really hope there are many more seasons to come! Plus Joel McHale is reason alone to watch the show. :)"
5,Phenomenal,Easily one of the best shows that has come out in a long time. I'm counting down the days until the first season comes out on dvd so I can rewatch all of the hilarious episodes!
2,I'm a baby boomer . . . . .,". . . so I it's hard for me to understand the angst and humor of 20 somethings. Perhaps that's why I found this show's freshman year so disappointing. That said, the next two seasons of ""Community"" have been very entertaining.But back to Season 1: I discovered ""Community"" with Season 3's Christmas special, which was clever, entertaining, and beautifully performed. The rest of that year remained high quality. Of course, I bought Seasons 1 and 2 the moment they came down in price. Sadly, I found the first half of Season 1 to be mean spirited and a punishment to watch. The second half of the season showed a mellowing, but was pretty lackluster. The exception was ""Modern Warfare,"" a brilliant paintball-parody on war films."
5,Legen...wait for it...,"Dar...Oh sorry I got mixed, this isn't that ordinary sitcom called How I met your mother, this is actual humor.So, if you've seen Community, you'll want to buy it and if you haven't, well, you've got two days to see it before your execution."
2,Does it get funny?,"I am writing this review having only seen about eight episodes of season one and I am still waiting for it to get funny and I honestly doubt I will watch much more. I got the first season for a great price so that is why I gave it a chance.Joel McHale is fine on The Soup. Here, he seems completely wrong and there is no chemistry with any of the cast. There are some funny moments, mostly with secondary characters, but few and far between. When does it get funny?By comparison, The Middle was immediately hilarious with great characters and writing.Now, there are a ton of extras on these dvds so that is a bonus for fans but as far as the show itself? Not funny at all. So far, anyways. I will revise if/when I watch any more of this series."
4,hollywood's funny stuff,"This episode was funny. It is clearly written by hollywood about hollywood, with alot of references to movies, and tv. Particularly from the 80's. I think it has the potential for being a great series. Or falling flat by beating the same jokes and themes to death.It has a Bill Murray, John Candy, Chevy Chase Movie from the 80's feeling. It does this with deliberate self mocking by labeling various moments with Movies reference.I liked it. The cast is large so hopefully they will expand in possibilities of the various characters and situations and not let it become old in 3 episodes."
5,THIS is how you do a DVD! (tv series-wise),i just wanted to commend the community people for making a tv show dvd the way its supposed to be....with commentary on every episode! (not one or two with the actors acting like they were forced to do it at gunpoint) but every episode! making it a great buy for the buck. Nevermind its a great show (and hopefully will be back this/next season...)
5,The reviews are telling the truth.,"Over 100 reviews and almost all of them 5 stars. Yeah, Community is a great show, possibly one of the best on TV right now. Which is saying a lot considering it's only a half hour sitcom. The first season was good, but with the currently airing second season, they have really been consistently phenomenal. I recommend this to everyone with a pulse who has at least a nominal claim to this new-fangled thing called a sense of humor."
4,"A Very Nice Start, Could Be Good","The pilot episode of ""Community"" holds a lot of promise for an intelligent and witty sitcom. No spoilers from me; the show centers on Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a fast talking lawyer who has been suspended by the State Bar for not having a real degree. This first episode introduces all of the major characters and through a clever plot device gives us some of their background biographies as well.I was somewhat surprised to find Chevy Chase playing Pierce, an older student with a poor understanding of modern rules of behavior towards women. This could be an interesting character if allowed to develop.Hopefully the rest of the season will be as good as this one."
2,"Produce arrived defective, but return process was fine through Amazon.com","The colors were vivid and as shown, but unfortunately, the product arrived defective which was a bummer as we ordered this for a special occasion. However, the return process was painless. We did not buy it again subsequently."
2,"Super fun, but not at all durable","We loved this toy for the first day, and then my preschool age kids broke it in the next 24 hours. It doesn't hold up to simple dropping and handling. Also, the button didn't seem to work correctly for us. Wish it were more sturdy or we'd buy more, as it is super fun."
2,"Does fine with straightaways, but derails easily on curves.","I bought this in part because other reviews lauded the six wheels and their superior ability to stay on track. It's nonsense: the middle wheels float, so they don't help at all, and the wheels hug the outside of the tracks, so minor misalignments (which are very hard to avoid) send Salty off the tracks. I had such high hopes. Sigh."
3,Salty is a little unwieldy,"Have a couple of battery powered cars, and this one has never worked that well, it would run off the tracks, or just get stuck. Charlie works better.. they both aren't working at the moment, but they have been dropped a lot!"
4,Indoor grill,"Purchased this for my ceramic top stove and it fits my 11"" round cooking spot. Made a panini the first night and grilled some chicken breast without the press the next night. Less expensive than the French options and more practical than a dedicated electric grill. My only disappointment is that I didn't get the $3 scraper. The textured surface is hell on a sponge and a nylon brush doesn't get all the food bits off. A piece of wood or plastic does the trick easily. I am very pleased and look forward to many tasty meals.In regards to other reviewers. The textured surface is to allow the food to release better. It is easy to clean if you used it properly."
1,Gone Downhill,"We now have about eight of these phones in our office and we are looking for a new system. After buying the first four we were very pleased, everything worked great. After adding on another four phones the intercom system stopped working. Now the system randomly intercoms each phone. These phones are very sensitive and your phone lines need to be perfect for it to work right."
1,"Limited Centrex compatibility, if any","I bought the 955 with Caller ID, but this is the closest to review. I have only three lines, but bought a 4 line so that I can expand. The headset would not allow me to access the Centrex special dial tone to transfer calls out of the system. AT&T's customer service reps were TOTALLY USELESS and uninformed. After an enormous waste of time, I returned the phones. It is amazing to me that AT&T would create a phone that cannot be easily used with the Centrex system."
3,"A good phone, with some caveats","Well constructed, complete feature set for a small business or small branch office. (If you want caller ID, look elsewhere)There are a couple caveats: The features are difficult to program the first time, and the commands to set them up are counterintuitive to say the least. Once setup, however, the phones are a breeze and actually using the features is as intuitive as you could demand.The final caveat is simple enough: All four lines come in on two jacks, not four. This requires two-line adapters if, like us, your lines come in on seperate jacks. The required adapters should have been included with the phones. They're inexpensive, but inexeperienced users may have trouble locating the correct adapters."
1,Incidental book on a monumental subject,"Perhaps ""monumental"" is overstating it, but Twain was a great writer, Grant was a great general. This is not a great book and doesn't do justice to Mr. Clemens or Ulysses ""Sam"" Grant. This book reads like a Readers Digest article or Weekly Reader abridgement, there's little meat and too much padding. Actually the majority of the book is padded unmercifully. The segment on James Garfield's assassination is a bizarre and unnecessary inclusion, there are other bird walks which don't add up to a hill of beans. It's interesting that the author, Mark Perry, is quite evidently the author of the two positive reviews here, why this wasn't caught by a editor here is a trifle mystifying. My advice is to read Grant's own ""Memoirs"" and Twain's ""Autobiography"" and nother bother with this."
3,A Near Cat-Astrophe,"""Wish You Were Here"" is serviceable mystery, good for an afternoon read, but nothing to write home about. The idea of an amateur detective investigating a series of murders while unknown to her, her pet cat and dog are doing the same, is an original plot idea. Unfortunately, the mystery they are given is not very interesting. The whole thing, even when it's explained to us at the end, just doesn't add up. Add this the fact that the answers seem to just fall into her lap. Our hero goes from total bafflement to knowing who the murderer is in what seems like less than ten pages. The animal characters are well rounded and interesting. But the same does not hold true for the humans, who are consistently one-dimensional and forgettable. In the end, if you find this title in a used book bin somewhere, pick it up as good time filler."
2,Failed After 2 Years and 15K Miles,"Bought this Bosch plug wire set in October 2007 and put on my '98 Camry with 62K miles (along with new platinum spark plugs).Just turned 77K miles in December 2009 and picked up a 'Random Misfire - Cylinder #3' code. After troubleshooting, found that the misfiring cylinder changed upon swapping plug wires, confirming that one of these Bosch plug wires had failed. Totally unacceptable after only 2 years and less than 15,000 miles of use.Pay a few more dollars up front and get the NGK plug wires that Amazon also sells...wish I had the first time around...(BTW, good luck with the Bosch 'lifetime warranty'. Just try going to the Bosch site and finding any info about how to make a warranty claim. Not worth the little scrap of paper in the box it's printed on!)"
3,Too hard for young people,"This is a cute game, but aggravating. Parents are never happy and there are no instructions as to what to do. It gets better as you figure it out, but still hard."
5,Good fun and very cute,"I bought this game for my niece. It was very cute and we actually played it together on Christmas Eve. The babies are hysterical. You can take care of them, get them special outfits, and even clean the house. If you do things the babies don't like, they throw a fit! Ha, just like real life. The game is pleasant and fun, and actually teaches kids a little something about responsibility. Not a bad purchase at all :)"
2,Louis Riel,I was disappointed in the music and acting - - too stiff and poor performance. Much of the singing is in French which I cannot understand (my fault) which was somewhat of a surprise even though it was the language of the era.
4,Splendid. It really expanded the Dune Universe,The book was great. I enjoyed how Leto played mind games with the other characters. It also makes you wonder about how our own governments work. The little excerps from Leto's book made you really aware that some of the patterns he wrote about are around in the present day.
2,How could it be this bad?,"The setting for the Dune world, with all its factions, and mix of jedi-type magic and politics is probably the most exciting, interesting, and marvelous setting I've ever read about. So how could this book be so bad?There is almost NO action and an immense amount of dialogue. At times I believe Herbert was just talking to himself, amazing himself at how clever he could be.It's everybody against the 'God Emperor' but how do you defeat someone that knows the future? Obviously Herbert couldn't figure it out either because he had to make Leto II purposely dense and uncaring so that everyone would have a chance.I loved the first 3 and still plan on reading the last 2 but they HAVE to get better. If you can find an abridged version of this book read it just to keep up with the story line."
1,It's sooo sloooooow.,"This has to be the most tedious book I have ever attempted to read. Even by the new standards in glacial storytelling set by its predecessors, this stands out as a stupefyingly dull read. After a couple of hundred pages I was forced to start skimming, hoping against hope that something even remotely interesting was about to happen later on: it didn't. You'd have to have the boredom threshold of a slug on valium to make it all the way through this pretentious, verbose bit of authorial self indulgence."
2,Definitely not the best in the series,"I really didn't like this book. Not much happened and it just consisted of Leto II preaching to EVERYONE. The 3 books before this one were MUCH better and I've mostly through the 5th and it is also better. Basically, read this one just so you can move on in the series. Be prepared for lots and lots of empty dialogue."
3,Good but not for psp slim.,"I bought this for my sons Blue PSP Slim, thinking since the PSP and PSP slim differenciate in width not height it would fit, and it fits but its a little loose and it sticks to the case when opening or taking out turning it on, other than that its a good hard case."
2,Authur missed the point,"The premise was the ""Girls Guide to Global Dating"" right? All she does is go abroad and find Americans to date.... It was as disappointing as ""Around the World in 80 Dates"". I mean come on ladies... go abroad and meet the men there... don't just change locations and assume the same behavior/men as home. Mix it up a bit."
5,Wire harness,Was a perfect fit and installed with ease. Colored coded can't get much easier then this. Great product will buy again
1,I found this book book dreary!,"I have been an avid reader all of my life, but it has been years since I have had such a strong resentment of the current poorly written Lesbian Novels that have been thrown together and placed on the market as literature. There was nothing about this book that stayed with me, not the characters, the scenes, the connections-nothing. Filled with Unctuous writing style left me irritated. Sam's character Gillian is not only unbelievable but you want to strangle her just to get the book over with. I seldom say I found any book dreary, but that will have to my final comment here. Boring."
2,Better economy elsewhere,"While I don't particularly find much use for most of HP's premium paper line, their glossy papers offer a sufficiently distinct printing experience that one can easily find a use for them. They make excellent paper for final copies of work you intend to display, or even for stuff you merely intend to archive.This glossy, however, is not particularly recommendable because of its low value-for-money. Only ten sheets are available here. For virtually the same price you can get their professional brochure & flyer paper, which is double-sided and comes in a 50-pack. I therefore can't see an economic rationale to buying this otherwise excellent paper. Look for HP product number C6817A instead."
5,Say no to table salt forever!,"I had heard of Maldon Salt from various cooking websites/shows and debated paying what I thought was too much money for salt. Well, there is salt, and there is Maldon. A quick crumble of these flakes makes everything soooo much better! Dinner rolls, veggies, steak, porkchops, and desserts, too! Super good on brownies and no bitter salt taste. My new kitchen secret."
5,Best and most durable landscape light in the market,I have three at my home. High quality construction and well-built. It looks elegant and simply marvelous. It compliments your house nicely in the evening. I aiso have two Paradise 22688 spot lights and it works wonderfully too. Just love 'em.
5,Best book!!!,"This I would have to say is the best book on OOBE. Some of the ideas Mr. Robert Bruce presents, I don't agree with but still it is an excellent book. His split consciousness idea in the begining chapters is hard to understand but maybe that is the way things happen in OOBE. The exact mechanics are interesting but I am more interested in the results. He does have outstanding pictures which clarify the techniques to induce OOBE. He also talks about his OOBE involving prophecies and gives his personal example as well as how to record OOBE and dreams. For a novice I would recommend it but would tell them to focus more on the OOBE techniques presented rather than try to understand the mechanics of OOBE which I found complicated. However, this is an excellent, outstanding book! I would highly recommend it to all."
1,"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BUY IT.","After buying this ""Adventures Beyond the Body: How to Experience Out-of-Body Travel"", I thought I would find a better book about astral projection. This is another disaster of astral projection book ""Astral Dynamics"" I mean do these authors knowing astral projection at all. I am looking for a book to enhance my astral projection skill, after reading all these books, I think I could write a better book better than these authors. You might ask, what is wrong with this book, ""Astral Dynamic""? First of all, the author is not able to gather his thoughts together, rambling about the same subject over and over again. Second of all, author wrote nothing related to astral projection, but his own spiritual experiences.TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BUY IT."
4,Great...but nothing you can't easily find online!,"In conversation and on GDNet I have been condescending of this book and for that I must apologize - It is a great book for learning the Simple Direct-Media Library.I would definitely recommend this book if it makes you feel better to own a hard copy guide to SDL. However, I learned more through trial-and-error using only the online documentation."
2,"I guess the rest might be good, but...","The first few pages completely destroys this author's (and his editors') credibility. The passionate pre-game speech Tressel purportedly gave before the Fiesta Bowl was actually written by a FAN and posted to an internet message board. It certainly was stirring and passionate, but Tressel probably never even heard it (or of it) until some misinformed journalist mentioned it to him some time after the game, I'm guessing. He wasn't shouting, by all ACTUAL accounts, he didn't pause for dramatic effect. I'm sure it could have been a good book, but why start it off with a lie?"
2,Overrated,I was given this blush as a gift. It is not flattering on me at all. It makes my pores stand out and emphasizes lines. I am 35 and Ia told I have nice skin. The sparkles and shimmer are the probleI would not buy this blush again.
3,"OK, BUT CHEAPER OPTIONS",Expensive blusher probably because it is produced in limited amounts and there are far too many colors from which to choose. My advice is to find a clolor you like in this line and go to a drug store and get a similiar color in a cheaper version. Does it really make that much difference when it's on whether you paid $30 or $10.00?
2,NARS - Oragasm Blush,"Was very pleased with the expedient shipping of this order. As for the blush itself; it takes too many applications to even see a hint of color. I am of scandinavian descent (blonde, blue eyes, very fair complexion). I was hoping for some color to show on my face using this blush. Overall, am very dissatified with this product."
3,It's ok,Heard the hype about this blush on the Today Show...ordered it because I needed blush.I have had a compact of Chanel Rose Bronze (a very natural beige rose) that although I've used it daily has lasted literally for 10 years...and the color was always perfect BUT at $43.00 I figured I'd try this highly recommended NARS blush.Personally NARS is ok...not great and doesn't come with a brush...way too pinky...wish I'd just saved up for a fresh compact of Chanel after all although it's very expensive initially after10 years it works out to $4.30 a year!
4,Nars Blush,The color is very pink. It does not look as good as I would have liked on my skin tone. I tend to use my other blush more often
4,pretty shimmer,"I'm just adding to the mass of comments like mine, but here's another for the cause: i have fair-ish skin with dark freckles and dark hair and eyebrows. this looks pretty darn good on me. It's shimmery, yes, and it just might not be your thing. if you're skin isn't bumpy you probably won't hate it. With shimmer it can accentuate lines and ""problems"" (acne or pock marks), but it's still a great product for night if you want an easy One-Product-Application.My bottom line- if you're worried about the price don't buy it; if you're open for the risk or could give it to a friend if you hate it, give it a try! Odds are pretty good you'll like it."
3,"Not exactly universally flattering, but a nice blush","I purchased this blush after buying in to the TONS of positive reviews I read online -- that this was a universally flattering shade that just made skin glow.While it's a nice blush -- it lasted a long time and imparted great color on the brush and skin -- it was just a bit too brownish for me. I have very fair skin (as in hyper porcelain), but this would probably look beautiful on someone whose skin was darker.Next time I'm able to see the Nars line in person again, I'd love to try a different hue that flattered my skin a little better."
3,"Alright, but nothing great--especially not at that price.","PROS: The color is very pretty and (I believe) fairly universal for many skin types. It applies smoothly. That's about it for the pros.CONS: For this price I was expecting something way different in pay-off. I don't pack my blush on my cheeks, but I like to have some hint of color, but apparently NARS doesn't agree with me. I have to apply multiple times to see ANY evidence that any blush has been applied. I use good brushes and do tap the product out before applying, but that is only to ensure even coverage, and is NOT a problem with my other blushes. The other maaaajor problem with this blush is that it doesn't last. I don't touch my face a lot, but somehow at the end of the day my cheeks always seem to be bare when I wear this.I won't be buying this again, and I recommend any Lorac blush over this----amazing pay-off and lasting consistency, plus beautiful colors."
4,Needed for school,"I purchased this book on Amazon because I needed it for class but this book has some of the most interesting short stories in literature, it really should be a must have for those who lve literature"
5,Art and Mary Engelbreit,"This book is not only a nice size that allows for presenting whimiscal and colorful illustrations, but also contains oodles of information about her. Mary's illustrations are always fun to see and look carefully or you will miss something."
5,"Cellular Mount kit, works as golf course GPS also","Bought this mount kit for my golf cart,to house my iGolf GPS and it works great.The only modification I made was to place a rubber band around the ears(holding mechanism)because the unit is much thicker than a cell phone,and I wasn't too sure it would hold it in place, when hitting bumps."
3,"good, but its JUNK",this is NOT shuch a relisic looking prank so not to many people will realy fall for it.If you want a gooooood prank get the shocking pen expire edition!!!!
1,You can get this for free,I called Medela and asked how I could get tubing made by them for the first generation Pump in Style.They sent them to me for free (including free shipping.)
1,Translator,"I bought this for my Dad who recently moved to Canada to live with my brother. He is over 70 years old and doesn't speak English at all, and he started taking some English classes. He said he just started using it and that is good. I know it's not a very good review to read, but I have no more to say, Sorry"
2,Bought the 1450 to replace a lost 1440 - disappointed,"I owned the Franklin DBE 1440 for years and was happy with it. Although the screen wasn't very bright, in every other way the thing functioned very well. Lost it a few weeks ago and purchased the DBE 1450 model to replace it. YUK! The 1450 has an even DIMMER screen. Its almost unreadable. I find myself running over to a lamp or a window to it make out.Also, the 1450's verb conjugation function is controlled by a button on the new touch screen instead of a button on the keypad. Design mistake. I preferred the good old keypad. The touch screen buttons are tiny, dim, and difficult to use. I plan to return this model.Can anyone recommend a pocket translator with a bright, easy to read screen??"
4,very convenient,This is a very convenient aid. I no longer have to carry my dictionary and verb book when leaving the house. It has a pretty amazing dictionary with great examples of how the word is used. Definitely worth the price.
3,better than I thought,"My initial review of this was negative in regards to the verb conjugation this unit provides, but now it appears that the fault was in me, not in the unit. Now that I have been using it for awhile I have discovered that it does indeed conjugate verbs in most tenses, including the present and imperfect subjunctive. It is compact and faster to use than a book-style dictionary and has at least as many words as my paperback diccionario, although not as many as my big (huge) Oxford Spanish Dictionary. All in all, I am liking it better than I did at first. I'd like to go for five stars on it, but I can't figure out how to change my original star rating."
1,"HORRIBLE, stained my fabric!","Put the new cover on my ironing board and started ironing. It bled brown dye all over my cotton cloth! Checked that it was not an iron problem by using my portable ironing board. The iron was fine. Tried to iron on the new cover again & it transferred even more color to my cloth. Good thing I always begin an ironing session by testing on a cloth scrap. Not worth the hassle of returning, but BUYER BEWARE! BTW, the 100% cotton replacement I purchased locally is working fine.Too bad there isn't a 0 or even a -1 star rating."
5,great fro the price,great for the price decent quality fabric. nice pattern and plus the pocket on the side is great to store the cord
4,"Great Radio, but has limitations","I got this radio for Christmas. It works great, if you know what to do. Some people say that it locks up, well, it does if you have it in the car cradle when you start it up. If it does lock up, just hold down the mode button and the volume button. The unit should reset. I don't know, but the car cradle makes it lock up. That's why I lift it up just enough to disengage it from the cradle. I turn it on, and then when it boots up, I push it in the cradle. This radio has the largest screen that I have seen in a portable. I haven't purchased the headphones, but I am planning to during the Summer. If you can put up with the auto cradle messing up every now and then, this is a great car radio. What's best about it is that you can take it with you everywhere. It's very portable and smaller than an IPOD."
1,"I wanted to believe, but...","This is my third XM unit - Roady, SkyFi2, now this one. I bought it because I was impressed by the specs, namely the MicroSD slot and the ability to record songs for later playback. It felt to me like the ideal mix.Out of the box, it felt flimsy, and my hunch was right -- the unit died on me completely (won't turn on) about 18 hours after receiving it (only 2-3 hours of use). Two hours of troubleshooting with technical support has only confirmed it being busted. XM Radio has been unpleasant, to be polite, dealing with the matter (I bought it directly from them). This being the third Delphi unit to die on me, I'd avoid the brand... and at this point, I'm done with XM, after four years."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE","DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON-THEY ARE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON EVER AGAIN."
1,not as advertised,"After 3 years of enjoying Delphi's MyFi, I had to replace it. The SkyFi3 was my gamble and it did not pay off. The reviews were mixed but, I chose to try this model. Within the first hour after activation, I realized that the FM transmitter did not work then it locked up. Exactly as reported by other reviewers. It did work with the hard antenna connection but, this is impractical for home stereo units or with other vehicles. The following morning it locked up again after just a few minutes of use. Without a reset button or removable battery, you must wait for the battery to die before you can get it to work again. Don't waste your time or $$ on this unit."
5,Works Great!,"Works great and easy to install!! Had them on my truck in 10 minutes, but it is a 2 man job. Would recommend these to anyone!"
5,Beat waiting in line at autozone,Found this on my iPhone while waiting for help at autozone and after 10 minutes gave up on getting assistance and just ordered them... the arms are a perfect replacement and now the hood stays up! Just a note: these are under high pressure and were a little challenging to install
5,Great watch,"I bought this watch about two year ago. and I have received compliments from people around me. They are all impressed by the look of it. I like the eco-drive feature - no need to replace battery or rewind. It is solid and mascular, great as a gift. It even comes with an alarm that is handy sometimes. It is a $500 watch (list) but looks like a few times more expensive. I have a Rolex that is much more expensive but I still wear the citizen all the time!"
3,Gender ambiguity in Chile,"One of the 100 Best Gay & Lesbian Novels, Donoso's book centers on the transvestite la Manuela and his/her daughter who together run a whorehouse. Donoso's crisp voice lends an intense atmosphere to this intriguing story about machismo versus sexual ambiguity. I am always drawn to foreign literature, and I highly recommend Donoso, who in some ways reminds me of Manuel Puig and his ""Kiss of the Spider Woman""."
4,My kids loved it!,"I bought this hoping to introduce my kids (ages 4 and 6) to some of my favorite holiday songs and was not disappointed. They played it over and over from early December through mid-January and would walk around singing the songs. It really added to the holiday spirit in our house. I especially like the way the songs are divided into silly, classic and religious on the 3 CDs. The only songs missing are the Dreidel song and Feliz Navidad. My only complaint is that many of the songs are sung in a really high key, making it difficult for me (and sometimes even my kids) to sing along. Great purchase, though - worth the price!"
2,An Advance Book?,"I used the SolidWorks for Desingers Release 2003 book by Sham Tickoo for the last three months. This book IS NOT for the new user and is not one of his better written books.I used the technical support, and I was very disappointed in their response time and ANSWERS to my questions. NOte: I felt that they did not want to take the time to address my issues.The author has PowerPoint presentations available for teachers. I do not teach, but I was not impressed with the quality of the PowerPoint presentations. I would not use them to teach fellow colleagues.I found many typos and mistakes in the book. I have used other books written from this author, and they were much better. I will not purchase another SolidWorks book from Sham.The layout of the SolidWorks book is confusing. Sham jumps back and forth between advance and beginning topics leaving large gaps in various areas, even for the advance user. I hope Sham does not teach this way?"
2,Not as good as his other Pro/E books,"I am a professor that teaches 3D design at a leading University in CA. I had a few students that read reviews on Amazon.com on this book and recommended the book to me. I received a free review copy of this book from my book rep.I have been using and teaching SolidWorks for the past three years. It is a great 3D design tool. The Author of ""SolidWorks for Designers Release 2003"", Sham Tickoo has a good name in the industry for CAD and Pro/E.At reviewing the book, I would not adopt this book for my class even if my book representative provided the books to me for free. The book is riddled with mistakes, incomplete areas and solutions. Sham uses the term, ""Real world"" examples in each chapter. I question if he really understands the word of ""Real World"" with his examples and solutions that is provided in the book.A good part of this book is that Sham provides teaching aids, but I question the quality of these tools for faculty or for individual users."
2,A book designed by committee,"I bought this textbook along with two other SolidWorks books.This is a textbook designed and written by a committee. There is little focus on anything, and the book has you going in numerous directions. I was lost many times!!!It is not a step-by-step book and it is not for the new user. I have been using SolidWorks for 2 years, and I had a hard time with this book.I also found many technical and non-technical mistakes in the book. I will contact the author to convey my issues.."
2,was this the only volunteer actress to do this?,"A lady is performing yoga exercises during two hours, completely naked. But in my opinion she's too old and too fat for this kind of work. Perhaps she was the cheapest actress who wanted to do this? I should recommend the other DVD of this series ""Naked Yoga Teacher"", which is much better."
4,nice photos,"This book was required for a photography class, its a great book with nice recreation of the photos. I was expecting more of a technique book, but really is more about theory over practice. If you're looking for techniques this isn't the book, but for direction and theory along with some great composite images this is a great book."
3,Good product,"Product is simple to set up and use, however the range of the infrared is limited. The quality is great and uses the regular headphone jack so it can be plugged in and used with mostly any electronic device with a headphone outlet."
1,Invisible Product,Customer service non-existant. Never replied to any e-mails in reference to a product that never came. I would warn anyone from ordering anything from this company. Amazon saved the day on this one.
1,Not Happy,This product was not worth the price. My daughter was not happy with this toy. It was not at all what I would have spent that kind of money on. We could have went to the local craft store and found better
5,RG's Only Recording from the 80's.,Robert Goulet sounds very good on this recording. He had not done much studo work since his Columbia days (last in 1970). He made some independent recordings in the early to mid-70's but they are not his best stuff.By 1986 he had his life on a great path and was clearly in a groove when he made this recording that includes some new material. If you are a fan you will enjoy this album.
2,not as expected,"My new car has a CD player so can't listen my MP3's any more. So wireless tranmitter is the only choice for me. I got this item by looking at the reviews, but I am disappointed. Once you find the channel it keeps drifting in a few minutes. Then you need to tweek a little every few minutes. The tune nub is so sensitive that there is very little range that you catch the signal and few minutes later it is gone. I think I will try irock 300w see if it works. I am definitely returning this item"
3,modify it,bought this to use with my mp3 player for my car. initially had a very short range and didnt work very well seeing as i live in a fairly big city... so open it up get a longer fm antenna(just alonger wire) and connect it. after that it worked great and sounds good
5,Living History,"Thought there was nothing new to learn about Magellan's voyage? So did I until I read this book. Ms. Bender provides a completely new perspective and writes in such a vivid and descriptive way that you feel the deck roll beneath your feet as you read. She is equally adept at getting inside the heads of officers, captain and crew. I truly felt for the first time the horrors as well as the exhilirations this crew must have experienced. A vibrant account from first page to last."
5,The Bride Finder,Once I got into the book I couldn't put it down. My stomach was in knots as I read the pages. Madeline and Anatole go through many obstacles of find true love but it's soooooooo worth it.
5,Can't say enough good things about this book!!,"This novel was so poignant, so beautifully written, so wonderful, so...everything!! Deffinetly a keeper and destined for my keeper shelf. Read it, you'll keep it too!"
2,Self Praise Is No Recommendation,"This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer. Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all his first person I-Me-My references."
5,A great book by the foremost gentleman of golf,"Arnold candidly describes his life-long love affair with golf and its great traditions. Even a non-golfer will enjoy his lessons about sportsmanship and life in general. I especially savored the stories about his friendships with the U.S. presidents since Ike. His aviation adventures are surprisingly hair-raising at times. The book shows us why he was named ""Sportsman of the Decade"" in the 1960s."
2,I'M QUITE DISSAPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE,"A PRINCESS AND 8 SAMURAIS BATTLE THE HIKIMA CLAN. THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS."
4,OVERALL OKAY SPEAKERS TO HAVE!,"Yea i just got these speakers and hooked it up to my mini home theatre system and its adding in the extra boom, bass, treble, etc that i needed to rock my house until the day after forever. it's very good quality and i recommend these speakers to anyone who wants an amazing sound experience! it gives clear sound which is a must have when it comes to speakers. i give it 4 stars because i think the price could of been a little bit lower for these speakers . . . i mean cmon 25 bucks a peice is pretty high! but overall its well worth the money if you can experience the sound quality that it returns!"
4,Dog Tags,"I Loved Dog Tags - Straight or Gay should view this film.Isn't life really all about acceptance and finding yourself? Yep, it sure is and so I could very much so relate to this film and thought it was well acted and true to heart."
2,Dog Dags,Cute boys but the story goes nowhere. I was unfulfilled by this movieand my boyfriend fell asleep.
1,The Worse Film In History,This movie has got to be one of the worst movies in the history of film. That's all I have to say about this DVD. Don't waste your time. I would rather stick my head in a garbage can filled with vomit than to see this movie again!
2,JUICY,The title more or less speaks for it self. Good but not the best I've read in these type of books.
1,OK but not fully correct,this book gets the point across but its not very detailed.some of the spells are actually writin wrong on purpose!if you really want to learn i rrecomend forking out the money and getting a full or more indepth version.
2,Read Lovecraft Instead...,"H.P. Lovecraft was one of the greatest Gothic FICTION writers of the twentieth century. I love his Cthulhu stories, but that's just what they are...stories. The Old One's aren't coming. Sorry to disappoint all you Goth kids out there.And no, just because you believe in something doesn't make it true. There's a word for people who think that way. Look it up in the dictionary. Its called DELUSIONAL.If you don't believe me, then buy this book, cast the spells, and see if Cthlulhu comes. How long has this book been out? Almost twenty years? If all someone had to do was recite one of the spells, don't you think Cthulhu or Yog Sothoth would have broken through by now???KUTULU...AZAG THOTH. Wow! They're spelled diferently! That means it must be true! Losers."
4,Great for Lovecraft buffs,"This is a great book to throw on the shelf beside your Lovecraft collection, but it's bunk. I've been to a lot of bookstores, flea markets, Occult Supply shops, Magic (magik, magick, get over the spelling) circles and what not, and I have never seen a big banner reading ""The Secrets of the Multiverse Can be Yours for $6.75 Plus Shipping!"""
1,"Fake, yes but it has fragments!","Yes, of course this is not the authentic Necronomicon but it still has fragments in it. Get rid of this book if you own it. Burn it , trash it , rip it up. It will destroy your life , for sure! You can rip open a portal in the fabric of space and time and take your chances of what will come through? Jack Parsons did this and we know what happened to him eventually. Don't read this."
1,From someone who knows the story....,"This particular book was written as a joke by a couple of Pagan Elders who owned an occult shop in New York City. The prime movers behind its creation have now passed on to the Summerland, and its time the truth about this book came out. It was written to make money, for a lark, not be taken seriously. Far too many people have wasted valuable time and energy that could be better spent empowering their lives and bringing blessings to themselves rather than wasting their time by attempting the practices in this book. If you really want to read and learn about Sumerian and Babylonian Deities may I suggest any of the several books by Samuel Noah Kramer."
3,The Necronomicon,"This work is a forgery by the late Herman Slater. However, all of the grimoires in the Solomonic cycle, such as the Goetia and the Key of Solomon, are also medieval forgeries in the sense that their authorship is falsely attributes to the Biblical King Solomon. Slater was a guy who knew his stuff and many sorcerers have reported interesting results from using the spells within. It is essentially a system of planetary magic in that it contains a system of planetary initiations and evocation. I find it to be a good source for talismans and demonic sigils. Debates about this grimoires authenticity or historical and mythological accuracy are simply barking up the wrong tree from a magical viewpoint."
1,Posession,"I was at a party and some of my friends who were into necromancing.....we tried a sayance without the book.I have never tried any of this and i had a gut,bbaaddd feeling about something....I couldnt quite put my finger on it...My friend's house was haunted by an unknown spirit.It went bad when they tried to make it leave...4 of us on the couch...My friend Rebecca jumped up and shouted DAMN YOU NO! after the bell rang out...She fell back to the couch laughing hysterically...not the Rebecca i knew...i knew the book was a bad omen...."
1,This book should be avoided.,"I read this book when I was a young impressionable teenager with a fascination for the horror fiction of HP Lovecraft. This book is dangerous in my opinion, and should not even be published. Some people seem to think this book is a hoax; not really an ancient Sumerian text, but rather a work of fiction in disguise. Maybe, but I would still avoid this book like the plague. Turn your interests instead to something positive."
1,Moron believers.,For those of you who simply must believe this nonsense PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS:http://www.hplovecraft.com/creation/necron/Reality is not a bad thing. It really isn't.
1,toss,"total garbage. typical mass market stereotype hype drivel. The odd sub-intelligent gullible twit prone to daft placeboic delusions might actually believe this tripe. Still, vaguely amusing in a completely pointless kind of way. I'm off to talk to satan and hang with the spell-casters of Zagomod 7. Hooray. necronomicon? nothing but over-rated rot logic. dime bar anyone?"
3,Necronomicon,It's okay. Good fiction. How can people believe this to be true though after Lovecraft himself said that he made the Necronomicon up? It's quite simple; stupid people with good taste in books. :-)
3,"poor, deluded creatures...","If malah13 or the person now scouring Europe for ""the original manuscript""is interested, I'd like to sell them the Brooklyn Bridge. Once they own it, they can redirect traffic to Castle Rock, ME, and use the toll money to finance an education at Miskatonic university. Upon graduation, they can go to med school and study under Doctor Caligari and Moreau, unless the martians that attacked us back in the 20's return to finish us off before then. For the rest of you, the Necronomicon is a mildly diverting piece of FICTION. That's FICTION! Get it? Seriously, for a better read you ought to check out the original writings of Lovecraft, Lumley, Bloch et al, whose stories were the inspiration for this bit of fluff."
4,I found this book unusually interesting for one of this sort,"I just finished the Necronomicon, and it has been well worth my while. I liked it because, it included a lot of truth, and I recently became interested in this subjecct. In all, I found this book unique and well worth reading."
3,The Necronomicon: A neat read (even if it is fiction).,"The Necronomicon is the book of the dead. It is presumablya refurbished copy of the age-old manuscript. The spookystory in the introduction is the best ghost story I haveread in a while. The bulk of the text is dedicated torelaying chants and incantations of the elder and ancientlords; including many diagrams and pictographs that areof great use with Ouija bords. The tale of the Mad Arabis included with the book; a tale which will perk up theears of any fan of fantasy. I recomend this book to thoseof you at your wits ends - attempting to find something wayout of the ordinary, with occult overtones. Note: No thisis not ""satanic,"" satanism is a completely different animal."
5,suspenseful,Product arrived fast and in perfect shape! Loved this movie years ago and now again! Would buy again from this store!
3,Fun film indeed,The worst elements in this story are ---none. All the earthquake victims have interesting enough stories to tell. The added tv footage with DebraLee Scott as an airline passenger whose plane lands in the middle of the earthquake don't blend well in but everything else is expertly handled. I haven't seen the DVD version. I've just seen this film on cable a lot so I don't know if Ms. Scott is on this DVD or not.
3,A minor correction,"Another reviewer says this movie employed a technology called ""Surrondsound"". Actually, the term used at the time was Sensurround (spelling courtesy IMDB). The gimmick was to loosen the bolts of the theatre seats and use low frequencies to cause the seats to move - as if in an earthquake. Also used, I believe, in the films Rollercoaster and Midway. I think it was being confused with Surround Sound, the ubiquitous home theatre technology. At any rate, this is a terrific example of the heyday of the Hollywood disaster movie. 80% soap opera and 20% special effects action extravaganza. Still, it's a lot of fun and worth watching - if only for the clothes. The true disaster in this film is the leisure (whatever happened to 'i' before 'e' except after 'c') suits. Those were the days!"
4,A Good Disaster Flick - Even by Today's Standards,"Earthquake realistically shows us the devastating effects of such an event on a large modern day city. Since movie studios didn't have the resources in 1974 to add expensive computerized effects, miniatures, camera trickery and a few large-scale destructions were used to simulate the quake. However, even by today's standards, most (but not all) effects are very effective. Many of the buildings we see crumbling to the ground are actual locals in Los Angeles and anyone living is this area (myself included) would still find watching this film chilling to say the least. The sets are very impressive - they made one helluva mess of Universal Studios making this movie. The acting is so-so, and the ending is a little disappointing and leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions: what ever happened to Miles and Rosa's brother anyway? But as far as pure disaster entertainment goes, this film has it all."
3,Goodtimes deserves credit for fine DVD release!,"""Earthquake"" was a great 70's disaster movie starring Charlton Heston, Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, Genevieve Bujold, Victoria Principal, George Kennedy and many others. I was very happy to find that the Goodtimes release of Universals ""Earthquake"" was widescreen and in dolby stereo surround. The picture and sound quality exceeded my expectations which were low due to the budget price. Frankly, I didn't buy this movie on Laserdisc because the MCA-Universal release was priced a little to high for a seventies disaster flick. I hope Universal will continue to license Goodtimes to issue many of its older films. I like the prices and am amazed by the overall quality I am finding. Thanks, CAL"
4,"great for steaks, vegtables and fish","I use this pan for steaks, fish and vegtables. Steaks on this pan at medium high heat are incredible. The pan is very heavy and it holds heat well. Try grilling asparagus on this, toss in some fresh rosemary at the end.Downside: The pan is quite large, it's very heavy and it's not easy to clean.My 18yo son who is learning to cook has this on his ""must have list"", (along with my plasma tv)"
4,Accounting review,This was a good presentation of basic accounting systems geared primarily toward business people wanting to get a basic idea of how to classify their accounting transactions. The content was also a good primer for accounting students about accounting systems.
4,A Got To Read book,"The Thief Lord is about two brothers: Prosper and Bo. Their parents died, and thier aunt wants to send Prosper to a boarding scool, and adopt Bo. They run away to Venice, and join a group of kid thiefs (whatever)led by someone who calls himself ""The Thief Lord.""Soon the thief lord gets a job of stealing some thing, and he takes it. A very good book."
5,Amazing,"Such a cool book! Runaways survive on their own in the streets of Venice, stealing and hawking their wares to a local shifty store-owner. Their leader, who calls himself The Thief Lord, is given an offer to steal a wooden wing from a quiet house. As they begin to wonder what is so special about a wooden wing sculpture. With bits of magic and mystery, intrigue and secrets, The Thief Lord is a wonderful book, exciting, and full of vibrant, funny characters. Great for adults and kids alike!"
4,Holy Moly! This book was cool!,I think Cornelia Funke did a good job on this book. She made it kind of a mystery and an adventure all in one. She developed her characters well and my favourite character was Hornet.
3,Just an okay book.,"This is one of those books I call an ""Eh"" book. It not bad, but it's not great either. It's okay. I LOVE Cornelia's books. But this one failed to excite me. It has an interesting plot... but starts off slow. Most people will find it difficilt to follow. I highly reccomend to watch the movie before reading the book. That way you'll at least have an idea of what's going on."
4,family fave,"I read this book to my son when he was younger. We both really liked it. It did get a little strange with the merry-go-round, but overall the story did keep our interest."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Lately, I've only been reading adult books so The Thief Lord proved to be a welcome change. This book is fast-paced and thrilling. It is definitely a page turner. The story is engaging and I love all of the references to Venice's monuments, language, culture, and history.There are tons of fantasy and children's books, but The Thief Lord feels fresh and it doesn't seem to be full of cliches. The plot is interesting and has some nice twists, like when the reader finds out who Scipio really is. The characters are fairly developed. The writing is not the strongest I have read, but is interesting.This book is great in the middle and beginning, but towards the end it gets a little dull and the plot falls a bit flat. I wouldn't be suprised to find out that Cornelia Funke lost direction or had to finish the book quickly. Still, Funke weaves an interesting tale, and I did find The Thief Lord very enjoyable."
3,Not as Good,Definatly not as good as Dragon Rider or Inkheart. The fantasy is very low but it has a good adventure of children suviving in Venice
3,"Great beginning, story fizzles out...","It's no wonder ""The Thief Lord"" has been popular: an exciting setting (Venice), well-developed and likable characters, an intriguing story full of interesting plot twists. BUT...after creating such a delightful and fascinating story, the author resorts to a completely implausible ending that left this reader thinking ""WHY?!"" This book could have gone in so many other interesting and more satisfying directions. It was if I had started out reading ""Oliver Twist"" and ended up with ""James and the Giant Peach"". Both books are marvelous in themselves, but together they don't make sense. This is the feeling I had after finishing ""The Thief Lord."" If you don't mind the reality-altering portion of the plot, this book is a good read."
4,This book...,"Blew me away. It has to be one of my favorite books that I have ever read, and I tend to be the picky type with books. Its about these two kids that run away from home to Venice because there parents told them that it was a magical place with roads made of water, and gargoyles fly over the skys. When they get there, there starving, no food, and nowhere to sleep, but a band of runaway kids help them through there problems. The leader of the band of run away kids goes by the name of ""The Thief Lord."" Very quickly, the main characters and the run away kids are in way over there heads on a magical adventure. This book keeps you wondering on what is going to happen next and making the book hard to put down.-Dino"
4,beautifully written,"The ""Thief Lord"" is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss, beauty, adventure and a little bit of magic. Cornelia Funke's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped Harry Potter off the best sellers list in Germany and Northern Europe for a time. It never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well. The imagery of Venice is dead-on (just like I remembered) and the characters(Prosepero, Scipio) are richly portrayed. This is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics!The main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also. Geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults."
1,The Thief Lord disappoints,"The book starts out strong, with engaging characters who made me want to learn more about them, and a dramatic but well-motivated conflict. The momentum carries on almost throughout the book. Yet though the characters are strong and diverse enough to come to grip with these challenges, the author solves all of their problems -- literally by magic -- at the last moment, robbing the reader of the chance to fully enjoy the book. Some other books by the same author - including Dragonrider - are much more consistent, but I advise that you shy away from The Thief Lord."
3,Nintendo DS - Fashion Designer,"I bought this game for my 7 yr. old daughter to keep her busy on a long airplane flight. She was interested at first, but got bord with it after a while. She rather have her brother's Lego - Indiana Jones game."
3,"Good book, but not budget sensitive","This book offers comprehensive information on baby products and I recommend it. However, it's really not geared toward the budget spender and seems to assume that price is always an indicator of quality which is not always the case. If you're on a budget, I wouldn't get this book as it will make you feel bad for not getting the top quality, top dollar item on every baby purchase you make. I did get a lot of useful info from this book and I continue to refer to it. I just think it could give more options for people who aren't rich."
5,The book gives you the bottom-line on the best baby products,"This book was the best baby/pregnancy book I bought! I was so overwhelmed by baby products when it came to shopping for my first child. The Fields narrowed it down nicely and gave great advice on what to buy, what NOT to waste your money on, and how and where to get the products, including mail order and internet shopping. It's a book not to live without out, especially if it's your first child!!!!"
2,Coupons are for newspaper inserts - not books of quality,I found this book to be tempting due to its format and the the fact that I can't resist coupons. I did however find the title misleading. I assumed that it was a more up to date Consumer-guide book. I would still suggest that you use common sense and shop around....you can find good deals if you are a good shopper....and the authors should come up with a better title rather than suggesting that everyone is a dumb shopper and needs their help. It dilutes the legitimate content that is actually in here. I find the title a little insulting.
1,A Typical Computer Book! Too many critical errors!,"The Book plan is very good. Fairly well written. However it was written primarily for Excel 2002, not Excel 2000. Chapter four which was one of my main reasons for purchase did not help me much with Pivot Tables. NONE of the Exercises in Chapter 4 would work on my excel 2000, and the Microsoft on line was of no help. Any Buyer wanting to use this book with Excel 2000 should forget about it. The book advertizes on its cover that it covers Office XP and Office 2000. It does NOT work well with 2000, and I am not sure about 2002."
5,"Great quality, carefull ordering sizes","I bought a few of these along with the matching battery terminals. They're great in quality, however, I ordered 4 gauge ring terminals and received 8 gauge. The packages they arrived in are labeled as 4 gauge so they must have been packaged incorrectly. Im now in the process of trying to exchange my items for the correct sized ones"
3,Nice kicks!,These shoes hurt a little when first worn but after the first couple times they were much more comfortable.
2,If you don't mind missing left messages this one's for you,"Stupidly I bought a second one of these after the first one failed. As with the first one, after about a year, it was randomly not recording some of the messages. Prior to that, and if it were not for this problem, I was very happy with it."
4,Entertaining,"I liked it, it was funny and entertaining, it had me laughing in some parts, it had me disliking Billie in some parts. She was way to attached to him it made me angry, but I guess it was all love which was somewhat sweet, some of it was extra mushy and some of the wordplay was off the wall but it was enjoyable..."
3,Only Time Will Tell,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was a little slow and going to be a bore; however, was I wrong. I was totally surprised, it was a really good book. The writing did hold your attention once the book picked up. The characters were each able to hold there own, they didn't get lost or caught up in the story where you forgot who was who. The main character Billie Burke, is a young African-American beauty editor who hasn't had sex in five years. Then along comes Jay Lane, an up and coming artist and down and dirty street hustler; when the two meet the chemistry between them becomes electrifying. Will they be able to build a relationship and survive the baggage they are carrying around from their past? Only time will tell.(...). Avid reader rating 3.5 out of 5 stars."
3,ok,Its a pretty decent book but it just wasnt my style. I did not identify with the characters and certainly wouldnt hang around people like them either. Thats just ME. I cant speak for anyone else. But overall it was pretty ok and I think the ending was pretty good.It took me weeks to read. The characters seemed somewhat shallow to me. And the exaggerated beauty jabber and their obsession with material things started to get annoying and parts of the books had WAY to much back and forth constant dialogue. It is implied that Billie doesnt necessarily make a whole lot of money and lives in a tiny studio apartment yet she gives away a 700 dollar bag because she simply doesnt like the color and can afford to wear gucci and minolo boots.That inconsistency somewhat bothered me. Started to question what was really important to them. The change in billie's character was very dramatic. And I dont think Tammy and Jay's issues were ever truly resolved. But hey thats life I guess.
3,I found this book rather good,"I thought this book was good but what could have made it great for me would have been less use of curse words. The characters were very interesting and you wanted to know more about them.So, overall I found this book rather good."
4,good book !!!,"this book was good, i must say it does start off REALLY slow but by the time this book introduced JAY's character ( who i must say im in love with ) it was super charged with passion !! This book oozed an urgent passion between the two main characters that one would only be so lucky to have experienced. I could have done without all the fashion crap that part was losing me !! But overall it was a good read and IM DEMANDING A SEQUEL !!"
4,Solid value,"If you bought your steak knives loose, the way I did, then this block comes in very handy. Simple, but attractive and effective. It sits on the counter next to my main block (didn't have slots for them). Worth the money."
4,Not compatible with Windows 98,Be aware that this product needs Windows ME or 2000 and does not run on 98.
2,Untimely,"I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a chronomancer class or prestige class that fit within the d20 system the way the shaman class from Green Ronin did; instead, we're presented with a class that uses a system of time points and paradox points and other add-ons. I wanted some neat time-related spells and items, but those are few and far between. Finally, I looked forward to reading innovative new ideas that would spark my own imagination, but unfortunately, there were none here."
5,Never had a problem,I have never had a problem with it and it charges my controllers great. I would buy these again and again and have recommened them to my friends.
2,Should read others reviews first.,"Product works properly, just expected different charger style. Mine came with a mini cable that has to be plugged directly into the battery. ""Strange"". But it operates the way I would expect, would have just preferred that product pic shown reflected properly to what you actually receive. I can use xbox controller if plugged with original cable, just wont charge the battery."
2,Ran great for awhile,"The Atlantis carpet extractor ran great -- for awhile. We had it just over a year (just enough to get past the manufacturer's warranty) when all of the functions except the vacuum stopped working. Before it stopped working it cleaned very well, but I cannot rate it high because of the poor reliability."
2,Eureka Altlantis Opitheat,"My first model cracked around the rear wheels. The entire casing! Tried again, as was in warrenty period, no problems getting a new one, but now the handle won't stay up. At times the dirty water tank is very difficult to remove and the soap leaks after time (both models. I have had much better for the money. On the plus side this cleans my carpets better than the industrial one I rented at the grocery store. I am in the market now with the broken handle and I will not replase this one."
4,Chicken foot,"It has been hard to find this game in stores so finding it online was great. I love this game. Similar to mexican train but, a little better."
3,'Wagons Ho; but it ain't Ward Bond',"If you're like me and grew up watching Wagon Train, Bonanza, and Gunsmoke, you couldn't wait to see the next week's episode even though some were not up to par with the rest. But don't get me wrong, I love The Preacher and all he stands for so every book about him is a great adventure. He and ""Dog"" do good deeds for all, only kill'in when necessary. He understands the Indian culture and there is always a reason when they go on the warpath and there is no exception here."
2,crummy track record,"I started out pleased with the Sharp MD player. I found it easy to use and edit the discs. I used it for recording live music, interviews, MP3, old vinyl records. But, unfortunately in two years mine has broken twice. It no longer records, and it is getting kind of touchy about ejecting the discs. More work on the design of this thing needs to be done. It's not a durable piece of equipment."
3,Disappointed,I can't believe I paid 16.99 plus shipping for some photocopied pages and a 99 cent cover. This item is overpriced.
2,SeraJinn,"I have had 3 Sandisk mp3 players, 2 of them were this model. Ouch!Nothing but problems. couldn't save my place in a book, and when turned on couldn't hear the sound until turned off and on again.Don't get this, I messed up trying again on it. Big mistake.2 out of 3 bad, is too big a risk."
3,Quality Issue,This is a great toy but there is a quality flaw that is vexing. Two of the bead colors on the wire track jam on the wire turns. Very frustrating for a toddler. This was easily taken care of by breaking the beads off. This was the royal blue and orange beads. I expect better from the manufacturer.
1,Looks good but I can't find the web page,"The book is supposed to instruct you by having you learn from ""real world examples and a live web site."" The only problem is that I can not find the web site.The only site mentioned in the book is a site for the ""essential"" series. The other books in the series seem to have sites, but this one does not."
3,"Pretty good, but it's flimsy.","I bought the Olympus Stlyus Epic one month ago, because it was the smallest 35mm camera I could find, it seemed sturdy, and it was weatherproof. I give it only 3 stars because after one month of use & carrying, it started to fall apart... the shutter-release button fell off, the flash started to become loose, and chunks of the case chipped off. I was very disappointed by how flimsy it was, I've used other (cheaper) cameras in the same travelling conditions, and they held up fine. Despite the fact that it fell apart on me, I was very pleased with it. The 38-80 Zoom was perfect, almost all of my pictures came out bright & clear (even indoors), and the controls are easy to figure out. Even though it takes good pictures, I regret buying the Olympus Stylus Epic because it fell apart after only one month, and I would not recommend it to others."
3,Varied College Essays,"I purchased 3 College Essay books (100 Successful College Application Essays, 50 Successful Harvard Application Essays, and Essays That Worked), and have the following comments... I believe that the Harvard book has the best suggestions on how to write an essay, along with the best commentary/critique. However, the essays are a bit too polished. I think for 90% of prospective college students, their essays would be more like those in and patterned like those in Essays That Worked. For varied ideas on essays, the 100 Successful book gives some good ideas, but I believe many of the essays to be subpar. I did each book to have some interesting general reading, especially if one likes ""short stories""... or if one is interested in 17 & 18 year olds, and what goes thru their minds."
1,not worth the box it comes in,"I bought this unit, recorded a couple of mixes with the optical line and took it with me for a walk, and it sounded great. The next day, however, I couldn't get more than 3 seconds of solid play. ""UTOC ERROR"" kept showing up and eventually no response at all at all. Keep all your receipts, you'll need them."
5,Murdock's Last Stand by Beverly Barton (Large Print Silhouette Sensation),"Description from the book back cover:A man of honour ... and honour was the only reason well-muscled former mercenary Aloysius Murdock agreed to be Catherine Price's bodyguard. For Murdock owed Catherine's father his life. But once Murdock laid eyes on his best friend's beautiful daughter, he realised he would do anything for her ... Catherine knew better than to succumb to the passion Murdock clearly offered, for she believed in love - and Murdock had given up on love long ago. Still, something in his heated gaze made her believe that the battle-worn bachelor needed her. Maybe just as much as she needed him ..."
2,What works on webs at banks review by Rhonda,The article was written in 1999. This article was dated and very basic information.
3,Interesting but not their best,"This whole entire Cd is remakes of songs by many famous artists that have influenced each band member over the years. It includes remakes of ""When I Was Young (the animals)"", ""Turn The Page (bob seger)"", ""Sail On Sailor (beach boys)"", ""Move Over (janis joplin)"" and the famous blues number ""Who Do You Love?"" which was remade by numerous musicians. This isn't their best work but it is interesting the way that they approach some of these songs. Also check out their remake of ""This Wheel's On Fire"" which also appears here."
4,Full of variety,"This study guide incorporates a nice variety of vocabulary activities that go with the reading as well as other enrichment activities students will surely enjoy. I appreciate the easy to reproduce pages, which are only front and back of one page per section.I don't like that it treats the chapters in pairs. It only asks four questions on those two chapters, whereas if I were writing my own study guide for my students, I would ask that many questions about one chapter. The guide is for grades 5 and up, which I would say is reflected in this aspect. I feel confident it will still be useful for my 7th and 8th graders, however."
2,Clogs easily,"We've had this feeder for about a year now, and like other reviewers have mentioned, you have to do a log of jiggling to unclog it. All it takes is a little humidity/rain/snow and even small seed won't dispense."
2,"Good for a while, but...","After several months, the wire that holds the feeder and has a sliding mechanisim for refilling, started to shred. Also, during several heavier (but not downpour-type) rains, the seeds became wet and started to clump together, becoming spoiled and unable to decend into the feeder. So the seeds were kind of a tease to the birds. After about 18 months, squirrels (who would regularly jump on to raid the feeder) managed to knock it off of the shepherd's crook that was staked into the ground. That's not easy to do, but squirrels have super powers when it comes to bird feeders. The feeder cracked and broke. While it's still usable, given the other problems, I'm going for another Squirrel proof feeder that I've found to be much better and longer lasting."
1,Absymal,"If there was a rating with negative stars, this book would get it. The author and editor were obviously trying to capitalize on Seabiscuit and just regurgitated inaccurate facts into print. One glaring error is very early on, when the author states that the Santa Anita Handicap's first race was in 1940. Nooooooooo, that is just when Seabiscuit finally won. It had been in existence for five years prior to 1940.I stopped reading after that, but a friend tells me that she switches either jockeys or horses in a single race. She should never have attempted to write about a subject she knew nothing about."
1,Not even close to the wire,"After paying good money for a new copy of this book, I felt downright gypped. Page after page is filled with stodgy writing and tedious information that reads like a compilation of disconnected facts, records and quotes rather than a continuous story. The many obvious factual mistakes that litter the pages also add to the feeling that this is the product of a writer whose main concern was quantity rather than quality; the product of a writer who was counting on the subject matter rather than the writing to be the main draw. Not recommended."
2,High hopes but disappoints in the stretch,"Nothing is left out of this book, no matter how relevant or germaine. Being a lover of nonfiction, I was excited when I saw how much I was learning about horse racing, but I gave up. Way too much rambling and whole chapters that were not needed. I just got too tired.I don't blame the author. She wanted to tell us everything about racing, the origin of race tracks, gambling, mysterious signs and religious symbols, personal lives of jockies, and for some baffling reason, the overwrought story of this guy she met once who came down with cancer.I blame the editor. I can find dozens of sentences that I just wanted to take a red pen to. ""Misplaced modifier,"" or ""run-on sentence,"" or ""Does not make sense."" Didn't Toby tell the author that the best part, the hardest part of writing is knowing what to leave out?Very disappointing."
2,Slightly below mediocre,"I was excited at the potential of this book, and continued to the end with the hopes that it would eventually redeem itself and get past being a sappy, rambling, humorless and heavy-handed account. Unfortunately, it didn't."
1,Don't bother,This book is terribly outdated making it useless for todays college shopper. Last updated in 1999 with many observations and details about the schools gathered from many years before. Not helpful at all since so much changes so quickly with college rankings and evaluations.
5,DAVE ROCKS,"I was at the Atlanta show a mere four days before Dave played at Central Park. I have been to four shows and by far Atlanta was the best show yet. Better yet, the set list was very similar to the setlist in New York. All of the same solos were done. Dave's skat was amazing to say the least. After watching the show on AOL, I was very nostalgic of the concert that blew me away. Needless to say after finding out that the show was going to be on DVD, I was so happy. I ran home from work, bought it and listened to it the same day that it came out. I sat in awe for 2 + hours. Yeah, it was incredible yet again. I have all of the live DVD's and this by far is the best one yet. It would be a great Christmas present for anyone who loves jam bands."
5,Amazing!,"I never considered myself a big fan of Dave Matthews until I discovered this concert. I got this dvd from Amazon just the other day and already I have found myself replaying parts of the concert, because you just cannot get enough of this amazing performance. This dvd shows how incredibly talented the entire band is, particularly in that they are able to extend almost every song into a jam session that is so amazing no one could possibly find it boring. What strikes me is they seem to never run out material to play, after all the concert was around 3 hours long. Yet I found myself wanting more after the last song had played and the credits rolled. Someone has to be good to have that effect. I'd recommend this to anyone who has a true appreciation for real music, yes I said real music. Go, ahead settle down for the evening and enjoy this one, or split it up into several evenings!"
3,Just A Little Disappointed,"The picture resolution was not the best. I guess because it's such a large photo. The paper quality was great; very thick paper and not flimsy at all. Great poster from a distance but when you get up close it's just a little ""fuzzy""."
1,Stevie Wonder -- Songs in the Key of Life,Too much emphasis on the making of the CD. Almost no emphasis on the actual songs -- I wanted to see the group singing entire songs -- it did not happen.
5,Songs in the key of todays life,"If you are a music lover, enjoy the entertainment of a true performer, this tape will find you in good spirits. Stevie and his friends will take you back to 1976 when all you heard on the radio was real music and Stevie topping the charts with one hit after the other, and after all these years they've still got it. It's a video all can enjoy, just like the music this genius has created for so many years."
2,Songs in the Key of life,Stevie is wonderful in any format. This video should include concert footage and is just not worth the price of getting just a little bit and not enought.
5,like them soo much i want to say they're perfect...,"denon ahd2000 head phones feel comfortable and sound excellent, but are not the most durably constructed. i bring mine to work with me to listen to mp3's. during transportation of the headset inside of my small gallon size bag the swivel screw bent and broke leaving one ear piece dangling. using a zip tie looped around the swivel screw joint and tilt bracket i tied it back together. months later now i'm still enjoying the superb sound."
2,Made In China Bass Heavy Junk For $350!,"First off, if you are releasing $350 headphones, don't make them in China, its just not a good marketing decision. And on top of that they sound like junk, you all need to do yourselves a favor and look for a good deal on a pair of Sennheiser HD650s."
3,Boo not so bad,"This is one of those books for kids that won't help them grow up to discover the cure for cancer, and won't make them want to run off an help the starving masses in Africa. Having said that my four year old son enjoys yelling boo! while reading it. My daughter, age two, also started yelling boo! as well.Munsch has written some brilliant books and some not so brilliant but never a bad or immoral book. The goal of his books are to get kids into reading and even with this one -- not his best (""I got to go peeee!"") -- he succeeds.If you see dangers and evil lurking in many places perhaps you should avoid this book but if you enjoy sitting with your kids and reading together give it a try. Especially in the days before halloween."
4,Needs an update... but still a must for every RFID professional,Book provides a solid foundation for RFID physics and the fundamental concepts. It gets really boring at times because of its staright forward approach and technical jargon. There is no other book in the market that capture RFID in such a depth; however the book is requires a immediate update to incorporate EPCglobal standards and other recent developments in the RFID industry.
5,Audiophiles take notice: Outstanding recording!,"This is a truly outstanding recording and performance. Audiophiles rejoice! Channel Classics tend to be very good SACDs, but this gem is above even their usual high standards."
1,BORING!,This book obsesses too much over family life than the Titanic. They barely talk about the Titanic. It is also very boring. I rate it 0 stars but that is not an option. We have to read it for school and I am only on page 64 because it is too boring! I have been reading it for about 2 or 3 weeks too!
3,Ttanic Crossing review,"In this book, Titanic Crossing, by Barbara Williams, the author tries to tell you how many people died on the titanic. The main character Albert, 13, his sister Ginny and his mother, and grandfather live in London where it&#65533;s always dreary. The whole family boards a train and gets on the Titanic. Then they leave for Washington D.C. Along the way they are unfortunate enough to hit an iceberg and the whole family is separated. The author&#65533;s purpose in writing this book is to show why it is important to remember the Titanic and the people that died on the ship. Find out what happens to Albert and his family in Titanic Crossing."
5,Awesome quality,This is an awesome product and the shipping was fast and realiable. I recomend anyone who cannot afford an expensive tv to look into using a computer monitor with these cables.
5,WHAT AN AWESOME PERFORMANCE!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RENDITION OF THE STAGE PLAY. I LISTEN TO IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK, OFTEN DAILY. YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
1,Why Reba,"I agree wholeheartedly with Steve from DC.Everyone else on the recording is adequate, but when Reba began to sing, I cringed. She has no business singing an early Broadway show. With her twangy nasal sound, she is as appropriate as Mickey Mouse. To the young adults today, I say if you are interested in early Broadway, and can think for yourself, then buy the original cast recording or even the movie version which has some interesting orchestrations. I saw South Pacific on Broadway which dates me. But please not Reba."
2,"Close, But now cigar","This book should be title loose ends.... not worth the money.... Too bad because the premise was pretty good, however the execution of this premise is very poor.."
3,Tea Trouble,"Although the teas in the sampler were adequate, the tiny tea tins arrived damaged. Lids were askew and some tea was spilled inside the enclosing box.That said, this product is a good gift for a tea novice."
3,Good Way to Explore Green Tea,"I can't hold it against the product, which was fresh and high quality, that I found that I don't like green tea, outside of gunpowder. Gunpowder was generally a bit darker and very smokey smooth. The others I tried seemed more like I was drinking grass or broccoli stew. I admit that my tastes are very unrefined. If you like green tea, this will be a home run!There is only one way to find out what you like, and at least you can try the best, when you go with Adagio!If you end up with gunpowder, get some peppermint and make a great classic blend!"
4,Episode 3?,Great season. All the episodes are fantastic. And the quality of purchasing them through Amazon Prime online was great. But where's episode 3 of Season 6?
4,Good game,"I liked to play this game. It's a mix of God Of War and 300 (the movie), good effects. In some parts, the graphics seems like PS2 grapchics. But overall, I liked this game. It's a good game."
5,GOOD But Does anyone know exactly how to record MP3,This player was my first md player. MY Goal was to move all my MP3 onto mini disc. But I am not sure how to connect the given optical cable to my computer. I don't know if i need buy another cable or do i connect it to my PC speaker or my sound card. If anyone read this please help me out Thank You
1,horrible machine and company,I bought this machine and registerd my product with the company in June of 07. I purchase my flavor packets through myflavia web because there are no stores which carry these products. That is your first problem getting the products. Which are expensive. Second problem is if it does work it wont work for long. It makes horrible sounds and going through their technical support is like going through microsofts. The company will not stand behind their products even if you are registerd with them. Buyer be ware!
2,At Their Lowest,"An album made lousy on purpose to defy the record company, I have very few kind words to say about this. No politics, typos in the song titles... i can't go on."
1,Log cabin with a twist by Barbara Kaempfer,"This book does not explain the pattern sequence Or give you any color suggestions to achieve the desired results as shown in the pictures in this book,I considered it a waste of money to have purchased it. I have wasted a lot of Hours and fabric trying to get the results as shown ..The quilt patterns should have a numbered sequence to follow to obtain these results. I have quilted a lot and done a lot of paper piecing ;but this book has me stalled. I am very dissatified with it.. I wonder if you have had any other complaints cocerning this book I would appreciate others in put on this book..Thanks, Oletta"
4,death watch,"This was a good and a surprising book. I would recommend this book to people who like surprise endings. If you don't like books with surprising ending i wouldn't read this. Ben is a starved and helpless man threw out the book with no cloths, food, water. Ben was also hunted by a madman with a gun. This all takes place in the middle of the hot destert . Overall i would rate this book 4 stars."
2,The desert heat should burn this book to ashes.,"The conflict of this story is between to characters, Ben and Madec. Ben is a risk-taking college student who works in the desert as a guide. Madec is a mean hunter who lives in the city. When Madec accidentally shoots someone, Ben is forced to run away from Madec. Ben is in the desert with no supplies or help.The middle of the books drags on. The ending makes Ben seem really dumb. This gives the book two stars. In favor of the book, it had a strong beginning and some good details."
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!!!,"If I could give this book zero, I would. This book is insulting, cruel, and boring. This book is about a guy, named Madec who is going around the desert hunting for bighorn sheep and is paying Ben to show him where they are. All Madec wants to have one for, is to put up on his office wall. I won't tell you the rest, but, I'll just say this, ""You know how they say that the books teachers choose for NOVEL STUDIES are supposed to be boring?, Well, my teacher is 49 years old, and he won't even choose it!"" I'm warning you now, !!!!DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
3,Deathwatch,"This novel was a little dark for me. I don't mind a story with some suspense or dark moments, but this story goes over the edge. Ben and Madec are connected together based on the chain of events. The events become more obscure with each page turn. An interesting story with a dark and twisted plot."
5,Good read,I first read this novel over 25 years ago and it still holds it's thrill. I just wish that Amazon would carry more of Robb White's books in a Kindle version.
4,death watch,"This was a good and a surprising book. I would recommend this book to people who like surprise endings. If you don't like books with surprising ending I wouldn't read this. Ben is a starved and helpless man threw out the book with no clothes, food, water. Ben was also hunted by a madman with a gun. This all takes place in the middle of the hot destert . Overall I would rate this book 4 stars."
4,Great for getting back to exercise!,Bought this set several years ago and it is my go -to set when I fall off the exercise wagon. Just brought them out after an extended illness and they are still perfect to get my body moving at 55.
2,"Slept good, but many leaks after one month of use.",Sure not happy with this item. Might be just some bad luck as it has leaks in5 places now and instructions of weight was followed.I have had an air bed for over 10 years and not one patch on it.I will not buy one of these again.
1,Disgusting Noise,"This group hired someone to pose as a community member on ALOT of websites and pasted this terrible album all over the internet. There is no place for this kind of advertising, and they fooled no one. I will visit everywhere this snake went and make sure no one purchases this garbage."
4,This is a useful book...,"but it oversimplifies the test in my opinion. I like to feel like I know what I'm doing rather than just be armed with strategies. I will say that the PR's strategies are great and really help out on the test. The writing style is easier to understand than barron's. However, I don't recommend this book for a full review of the concepts you need to know. It is a helpful supplement to help you review for the AP exam in addition to what you review from your text and notes."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hope for a satisfying read; they were dashed less than halfway through the book. Learner's book is packed with fascinating bits of Jewish mysticism and historical events however she does both the reader and the storyline a great disservice by failing to allow what she has started to reach its full potential. It's lazy writing and leaves the reader frustrated for having wasted their time. Gratuitous sex, unnecessarily graphic and violent torture scenes, and deaths that dishonored a cast of characters deserving much, much better. She lets the villan off easily while villifying a goddess; the research of which might have led this story to a much better and more accurate place. Too bad. This could have been so much more."
3,THREE to THREE and a HALF STARS,"This was a good book and I liked the story but I did get lost in some places and it was a little long that's why I would rate it three and a half stars. It's worth it but I would pay full price for it. For a bargain book, it's okay."
3,Present Tension,"What an interesting book.Not your run-of-the-mill romance with a happy, pat ending...more like Wuthering Heights/Tess of the D'Urbervilles (though not as literate) in structure and storyline.It also has elements of magical realism.It reads like a bit of a literary experiment, as it's done in present tense...an unusual choice. But deliberate and effective. Present tense creates an immediacy, and in this work, an anxiety for the characters, which given their time/place/setting and personal circumstances is apt.The novel is perhaps a little on the longish side for comfort, but I enjoyed reading it nonetheless.I'd say you'll like it if you like history, have patience, and are not expecting your basic Avon romance or easy-to-read (oh, how I hate this term) ""chick-lit"" sort of book."
4,The Witch of Cologne,"This is one of the best books I've read; excellent character depiction, strong yet loving main character, incorrigible antagonist that you truly want rid of. Ms. Learner's style of writing is very interesting and full of historical fact (complete with glossary of terms)! I enjoyed the ""meaty"" aspect of this book, in that you could not just sit down and read a few pages and absorb everything. This book is worth reading with your full mind and intellect to capture everything the author puts forth. This isn't a book for people who enjoy a bit of light reading, but if you every want to delve into a subject, this is the book for you. I absolutely loved it!"
2,Disappointment,"This book was so disappointing, I felt cheated. The book is supposed to be about a young Jewess at the time of the Inquisition. A woman who is a midwife and who practices the kabbala. A beautiful concept! A young woman living in dangerous times, who can get herself in trouble in so many ways! But, the book is not really about Ruth. It is about the men who swirled around her, controlling her life: The Archbishop, the canon for the Archbishop,and the Spanish Inquisitor, whose eye has been on this Jewish woman for a while. It is THEIR politics we get involved with,not Ruth's challenges.When the book focused on Ruth it was interesting, but that was far too infrequently."
4,"Scary, helpful, but not the only resource you'll need.","As other reviews mention, plenty of scary scenarios are recounted -- but with advice on how *you* can avoid them. If you are weighing your options, i.e. considering whether to buy an existing house or build new, this book will be a helpful eye-opener. But I don't think it is a complete, step by step guide for the home builder; you will probably want to use other resources as well."
3,Great Retro debut from really talented singer,"Ryan Shaw has a great voice, a really great voice, similar to Terence Trent D'Arby without all his dramatic attitude and he sounds like he's actually having fun. He clearly loves the genre of old school R&B;, Motown, and Soul and could hold his own among all but Otis, Stevie, Marvin, and James Brown. The majority of the songs however are too retro for my taste. They have that late fifties, early sixties simplicity that's full of energy but offer nothing you haven't heard before on a Time Life commercial for oldies compilations and the arrangements offer nothing new like Joss Stone's latest does.That said, the songs ""Nobody"" and ""We Got Love"" are unbelievably good and worth the price of the disc alone. I've been playing them constantly. In another era they'd garner him instant stardom. They may even do that now."
1,****VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED SAVE YOUR MONEY ******,"I heard a lot of hype about this guy being the new savior of a dead R&B; music scene. In my opinion it's still dead as far as Mr.Shaw is conerned.In some ways this album reminds me of Terrence Trent D'arby(were is he now)? A Wilson Pickett cover of ""I found a love"" a Bobby Womack cover of ""Looking for a love"" Mr.Shaw adds NOTHING new That would be noteworthy."
5,Love these bowls,"I love the quality, style and colours available with the soup bowls. Combined with the other pieces of Emile Henry I have purchased this is the best set of casual dinnerware I've owned."
3,First Story Saves this Anthology,"The first story in this anthology is the best and the only reason I'm keeping this book. ""My Love Life is Killing Me"" is the story of Alex, a divorcee set up on a blind date by a friend. She winds up with the private investigator following this man. Did I mention the blind date dies in the men's room at the bar where he's supposed to meet Alex? That's how she mistakenly sees John Tanner, a taciturn loner who doesn't believe he's long-term relationship material, and sits down and begins to talk to him.Alex is a dance instructor and there is a sexy scene in her dance studio where she's showing Tanner how to tango. And what do ya know, it DOES take two to tango and Tanner proves he's more than just a lonely P.I. This couple's chemistry is to die for and I've already read their story twice.The other two stories are okay, but nothing out of the ordinary."
2,Weak sequel,"Although I was definitely intrigued by the first book, the followup was a rather weak attempt. Could have had a stronger plot."
2,Twister,"Delivery of this product and the overall transaction was fine. Not a big fan though. It seems as though the rubber is thicker than other condoms, so sensation is way down. Also, not much of a twist. I do not recommend these condoms. Try fire & ice."
2,its not its portrayed to be.,All I got out of this was just the feel of an ordinary magnum. Nothing really special. The hype isn't true.
4,Secondary book,This was purchased as a second book so Icould help my granddaughter at home. The book was in very good condition.
2,Math book has a lot of errors in the answer sheets,I think that a book designed to teach math should have the right answers for the lessons. This book has a reputation among my son's classmates for having a lot of errors. For example a problem I just did with him wasm/-6 = 8. The text book says the answer is 48. The answer is -48. My sons comment was that he and his friends have found a lot of errors like this throughout this book.I recommend you do not buy this book. It also calls into question the editorial skills of Houghton Mifflin's division called McDougal Littell.It also says to me that the five star reviews for this book are either very generous or perhaps they have not really used this textbook.The reason I am marking the score so low (2 star) is because it is a textbook for math and the errors are math answers. That's terrible in my opinion-especially since it is not just one or two but a pattern showing a lack of care by the publisher.
2,Replacement School Textbook,The details and description for this used book did not mention that the quality was extremely used with pen and pencil marks on the outer edges of the pages. Make sure to ask specific questions about quality.
4,Peter Sellers,"I learned a lot about both Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan (bonus). I realize I have seen barely any of Sellers's films. I know him best for his role as Inspect Clouseau. My father was a huge fan of Sellers and took me to see all of his Clouseau films. Having now read his biography I can see a certain kinship between Sellers and my father. Both were rather depressed, insular people with well meaning but overly ambitious (and nagging) mothers and both never quite recovered from the divorce from their first wife."
2,Spotty quality control,I've purchased a number of these cables over the past couple years and they work well when they work. But the last two have had problems. Buzzy static which is some kind of connection issue. I think AT's quality control could use some improvement. Always check your cable when you get it to avoid having a recording ruined or going past the Amazon return period. The company does offer a lifetime warranty on their premium cables like these but Audio Technica doesn't pay return shipping so it can cost seven or eight bucks to mail it in for replacement. The company should offer free return for at least the first year. Buy Canare which now costs about the same and you'll have no regrets.
4,"...NO CD, NO EMAIL, NO ONLINE SUPPORT... NO HAY PROBLEMA","I AM A SECOND SEMESTER ARCHITECTURAL STUDENT AT PIMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND I FIND THE TUTORIALS TO BE VERY HELPFUL. EVEN THOUGH THE BOOK IS WRITTEN FOR ADT 2004, I AM USING IT WITH ADT 2005 WITHOUT ANY REAL MAJOR PROBLEMS... THERE WERE A FEW INSTANCES WHERE STEPS WERE OMITTED, BUT, LIKE ANY OTHER TUTORIAL, THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY WANTS THE STUDENT TO PUT THE THINKING CAP ON AND WORK OUT THE DETAILS. I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK, AND I OWN PAUL AUBIN'S BOOK TOO."
2,Meh.,"Not that great - only a couple in here that would be deemed difficult enough to actually need a step by step guide. A section on sponge painting? Really? Designers, stay away - this book is purely holly-hobby projects and you won't get much out of it."
3,Great Information for an Amateur Painter,"This book has many finishes and the instructions to complete each. For an experienced painter of faux finishes, this is too simple, but for a person just getting started ion doing this kind of work, this is a good instruction book."
5,Good to have..,This is a goog book to have.For amateurs like me this book breaks methods down to a step by step illustrated and recipes for paint effects and faux finishes. Worth it.
1,I had to send it back,The write up said it would fit on my SUV. It didn't. It seemed to be the right part with the wrong fastener to connect it with.
5,ejgc79,"excellent product, I recommend it seems very good quality was what I needed excellent excellent excellentexcellent product, I recommend it seems very good quality was what I needed excellent excellent excellent"
2,What Happened???,"It's amazing that the Chicago Symphony, once the toast of the orchestral world, never recorded Strauss' Alpine Symphony before this. Most of their other Strauss recordings are considered definitive. So, like many, I was looking forward to this issue, which turned out to be a disappointing train wreck. Like all of Erato's recordings with Barenboim and the CSO, the recording levels are frustratingly low and the sound has a thin, shrill quality. It sounds as though most of this recording was made when the orchestra (especially the brass) was very tired. Gone is the power and breadth of the Chicago sound, replaced by poor intonation, feeble tone quality, and sloppy ensemble. It's amazing that anyone--Barenboim, the CSO, or Erato's producers--allowed this horror show onto the market. I recommend the Cleveland Orchestra's powerful Alpine Symphony performance on the Decca label with Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting."
4,This dog has legs (my son uses it still after a few months)!,"Most plastic electronic toys have a lifespan of several days. Some break, most just really aren't as interesting as they appear to be. iDog is different: my son really loves his and he uses it regularly.It's not a great speaker, but it is an amusing little device with some clever ""behaviors"". It gets happy, sad, dances and its ears wiggle to the beat. It doesn't eat batteries. It's not as ""smart"" as the manual would have you believe, but it's smart enough. Hey, he's just a dog :-).The iDog will accept music from any audio source that has a mini plug for headphones (not just iPods). It has a little speaker, but also comes with a cord that you can plug headphones into, as well. It also can ""listen"" to music (and respond) without being plugged in at all. Simple, and pretty neat. And the price is right.Nice job, Hasbro!"
4,iDog,If you are looking for a high quality speaker for your MP3 player this is not for you. It is however adorable and a lot of fun. Another plus is that it does work with different MP3 players. I use it with my Creative Zen.
1,arrived broken,"I bought this item as a holiday present for our child. It was opened with great excitement - followed by great disappointment when we realized that it was broken. The lights work but it will not play music through the speakers.After a dozen attempts to call the manufacturer on their 800-line, I finally got past the busy signal, to some time on hold, followed by a human who took down the information. She said she'd send a mailing label for us to return it, and we could expect the label in a week. Once they received the product, they would send a replacement (after a week or so for processing) - though they could not promise it would be the same color. Shipping might take a little while, too. So, in a little under a month, I would get a replacement. So much for happy holidays.After some complaining at my end, she agreed to send out the replacement sooner ... but that was two weeks ago and we haven't received it yet.Happy holidays, Hasbro!"
3,Nice Picture...but lacks features.,"We recently got one of these TV's. It has a nice picture, but it has about two features, (closed captioning, sleep timer) That's about it. The price is great for a 25"" TV, but after using it, you can tell why it's cheap. My opinion is that I wish I would have spend the extra money and got a TV with more features."
3,Don't pay too much for this.,"The main material is weak. (not worth it)BUT, the EXTRA material is good.Not bad for the money."
3,Cultism for Cultists,"What do you expect from a book written by an extreme cultist? Martin Starr is a very active member of a Crowley-organisation (A.'.A.'.) and a close collaborator of a widely-known Crowley-body, called O.T.O.Although guised as a scholarly work, Mr Starr's book is of little scholarly value. It is like a book written by a member of Scientology about Scientology.Nevertheless, it is worth reading as an interesting tidbit about people who consider the consumption of sexual fluids as their ultimate religious goal. No wonder, Mr Starr does not tell us about it."
4,Nankering with the Rolling Stones,"Excellent! No true Stones fan should be without this book. It is the definitive work on the historic beginings of the ""Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World"" -- we see the boys in a much different light than any book has portrayed them previously. Emphasis is more on personalities than music. The only book coming close is Bill Wyman's ""Stone Alone,"" actually, this book covers the period prior to Bill's entrance on the scene. If you are interested in the early beginings of the Stones there are 3 books I strongly recommend: ""Nankering With the Rolling Stones,"" ""Our Own Story"" by the Stones themselves, published in 1965--I believe this is the FIRST book ever written about the group and by the group (out of print for years but well worth the effort in attempting to find it)and ""Stone Alone."" If you have these books you have a wealth of knowledge as to the inner workings of the Rolling Stones from the very begining (when Brian was deffinitely THE leader)."
5,My favorite jeans,"NYDJ's are my favorite jeans and I think this style might be their best. Even after a long day, they hold their shape. They fit correctly (no too-low rise muffin top issues here), have a touch of stretch and look good wash after wash. The only problem is that they are always far too long. I have a 31 inch inseam, and even with 3 inch heels, they are still too long."
1,Over Hyped,These jeans are cut very oddly. I have a pretty good figure and they look awful. The jean waist size that me fits is way too narrow across the hips and creates a huge tummy bulge with thunder thighs look. I don't look like this in my other clothing. It is unclear why NYDJ are so popular and I won't waste my time trying them again.
2,Wayyy too big,"I normally wear a 14 petite in everything, except shoes. These jeans were not a true 14P. They are proabably a full size larger than marked. I hate them. I tried washing them in hot water, hoping they'd shrink a little. But no dice. Now, I can't return them. Waited too long. Wish I'd bought them at Dillard's where I first saw them. Dillard's would take them back--NP."
1,NYDJ Waistbands Curl,I just bought two pairs boot cut.The waistband on both pairs curls very badly and got worse after I washed them. Not at all comfortable.CA# 38553 R/N # 132016CA# 38554 R/N # 132016
4,great fit but too long,"The jeans were perfect except that they were about 3"" too long and will have to be altered.I am 5'5''. When ordering, order one size down."
1,dve rack,We returned the item because the parts were not there to assemble it. It was too bad because it fit our needs perfectly.
4,"It's good, but...","Visually, this uniquely wavy stand is lovely, giving your DVD display a little more life, making it less plain. My mom actually got this stand shortly after me for the family collection. My only gripe with it is that it is a tad wobbly (at least mine was). But really, as long as you don't have anything (or anyone) that might go crashing into it, it shouldn't be too much of a problem (mine's now against a wall, in a corner)."
2,Unstable,"Very cute on the box. Thought it would look ""modern"" in my living room. I didn't think assembly was hard (as others have rated), however, the tower is very unstable when filled with DVD's. Because it's wavy, the center of gravity is not directly over the base. I ended up having to put a pad of paper under the front so it would lean back against the wall. Right now, it's back in the box in my basement."
4,A Good Buy,"Overall, I think this is a very good product for the price. It was fairly easy to put together, seems to be durable, and looks exactly like the picture on this website. The only problem we had was that the little balls on the top wouldn't go onto the rails easily because the holes in them were too small. We were able to fix this by using an allen wrench to make the holes larger."
1,Product Description Misleading,"At the image of the item on this webpage, Amazon describes this item as a ""1316 110 CD"" rack. CD? The image shows DVDs in the rack, and its description later in the webpage says it holds 74 ""DVDs"" -- which is also consistent with its reviews being for a ""DVD"" rack. But . . .Shouldn't have to take a chance that Amazon might take my order for an item called a ""CD"" rack at face value and sends a ""CD"" rack when I want a ""DVD"" rack. Not unlikely since Amazon also lists elsewhere a rack with the identical name (""Atlantic 1316 110 CD"") which does have an image showing the rack containing CDs -- and its reviews are for a ""CD"" rack.So I'm just giving it one star for now. Sounds like a real nice DVD rack based on all the good reviews -- and a nice ""DVD"" rack is what I want.JR"
2,Disappointing,"The writing is amateur and unfocused, like a fluffy magazine. The photographs are mostly of decor, not so much of architecture, and the captions are sparse. A good portion of the ""style"" aspect is devoted to making ranches look not like ranches. What is a pseudo French cottage doing in here?"
5,Great Book,Let him live by Laurlene McDaniel is one of the best books I've ever read. When Megan meets Donovan and learns of his disease she really wants to help him anyway she can. This book brings warmth and love I recommend everyone reads it.
4,This is an OK book,"This book I read about 2 months ago, and I still remember it!!This story is about Meg getting a summer job at the hospital where her father works.She meets a person named Donovan. Donovan needs a liver transplant, but the problem is that he cannot afford it.But then JWC comes into his life.Read the story to find out what happens!! Email me if you want to talk more about other Lurlene McDaniel books at jlsuther@yahoo.com"
1,Description Contradicts and it's the lesser of the two...,"The product is good quality, however the description and product are not the same. When I searched for a 50' cable and this popped up in the search results with the following description...""Product Description2-conductor, shielded, vinyl-jacketed, broadcast-type cable with XLRF-type connector at microphone end, XLRM-type connector at equipment end.FEATURES:50'Professional connectorsXLRF to XLRM balancedUltra-flexible cableHigh conductivity""...I figured I was getting a 50' cable, not so. It's only a 10' cable. Returning and ordering the correct item. 1 star simply for failure to offer an accurate description of the item. I will update the review when this is corrected and when I get the 50' in this series to actually be able to offer a true review of the product."
4,Ignore the Critics,"I have no idea why eveyone has such a problem with this compilation... I bought it the other day and have enjoyed most of the songs on it. People are complaining that this disc is full of songs from ""Mainstream Artists""? Hmm, maybe I'm just completly off, but with the exception of Weezer and Dashboard Confessional, all the other artists on here are pretty new. New Year's Day and Tia Tequila are as of yet unsigned by a record label,and Hollywood Undead is a new band that Myspace just signed.So stop bitching about this cd and give it a try. You may just enjoy it...P.S. Why are people comaplaining that Myspace was sold for millions of dollars? Are we just supposed to resent it when something many people enjoy becomes succesful?"
2,"Five stars for AFI, negative 500 stars for everyone else.","I'm not sure what to say, but if you don't know the bands on this cd then you are in for the emo a thon of your lifetime.The only real reason to own this CD would be for the unreleased (and I might add f'n excellent) new AFI song.The other bands that are actually worth listening to on this cd (e.g. weezer, dashboard) offer their hits from their latest albums. You're better off just buying those albums and downloading this new AFI song. The last thing the myspace guys need is more money (yes the site just sold for 580 million dollars). No, that's not a typo."
4,token entry rocks !!!,"With 'the weight of the world', token entry has made a very diversified rock album. Although not as hardcore as their previous releases, it is still powerfull enough to catch the attention of open-minded punk-rockers, metal fans, etc... Songs are not repetitive and are displaying lots of fun. So, give this album a chance..."
2,Not user friendly,I would say I hate this device but I don't know if I do or not. I can't figure out how to work it. It has the WORST directions of anything I've ever used. The device is cute and small and that's what I was looking for when I had to reluctantly replace the one I've used for several years. If I ever figure out what I'm doing with it I will change to a kinder review but I don't have a lot of hope for that. Reading the (deplorable) directions I see that one can only make playlists using the buttons on the device and do it individually for every song through a process- there seems to be no ability to do so on the computer. I will lose patience with that very quickly. Presuming I ever get that far.I think it's probably not a well thought out/user friendly device to begin with but the directions make a bad situation terrible. I'm off to beg my son to figure it out...and probably to look at other mp3 players.
5,Great,Roger is a great luthier and this book will show you what you need to build a nice banjo. I highly recommend this.
2,Book is almost all about Mason Decoys,I had hoped & expected more material on Dodge & Peterson decoys considering both makers are named in the book title. This book is mostly devoted to Mason decoys.
1,SURPRISE!!! No Warranty,"I purchased this product new and within 6 months it developed a dark vertical line along the right side of the screen. I contacted tech support and was told the case would be elevated and someone would contact me. 6 weeks later I had heard from no one so I called again and was told someone would contact me. Within three days I received a call to tell me that they would not honor the warranty because there were no known casses of this failure with this unit. The bottom line is... Trashy product, trashy service and there really isn't a warranty. Each phone call requires about 1 hour to sit on hold to eventually speak to someone."
5,Fascinating!,"This book is like having 8 years of German lecture notes all in one book. This book amazes me every time I open it up. Notes and rules, pitfalls and mistakes, tips and charts and tables, plus more! I would recommend this book to anyone studying German!-Dr. Kenneth"
3,"Just okay, could have been better...","I was bored with the writing but intrigued by the plot. The author's basic idea is what caught my interest; who doesn't want to read about a mistress who finally gets caught? The plot was interesting and had a good twist; I wish it had been executed better. The author touched on some good topics, and included a lot of information but it just didn't flow well."
2,Confusing and Boring Story,There was nothing I liked about this book. The writing was like elementary school age and the story was sooooooooo boring! Sorry but it didn't work for me.
5,Genius!,I do not believe there exists a better recording of the mass in b minor than this. Simply amazing. Another great job by Karl Richter.
5,Sodom's finest,"This is a great album. It's very speed metally, and the songs are memorable. I recommend this for fans of, let's say, Slayer's Reign in Blood."
2,"Okay, but passive mixer wasn't good enough!","For the price, the Azden passive mixer is really too expensive! Behringer audio mixers offers two different mixers that are amplified, that I needed for the same price or less. Behringer mixers have so many options for the same price, that it makes the Azden mixer over rated! I returned the Azden mixer. If you don't need any preamps for your mics and want a subcompact package for your camcorder, then the Azden mixer works okay."
1,This child has NO idea what he is talking about.,"I don't need to read his book. He just appeared on Larry King Live and told so many blatant lies, I lost count. He was continually proven wrong by the opposing speakers and he had absolutely no knowledge of facts or current events.The poor kid was absolutely lost. He couldn't even answer the most remedial of questions.After he fanatically praised the Iraq war, one of the panelists asked why he, a 22 year old was not serving.He stuttered. Lost all color in his face. His eyes went blank.""I'm 24"" was his answer.It was the most humiliating thing I have ever seen on live television. This kid is in way over his head. He is not intelligent or informed enough to speak on any issue whatsoever. (Except perhaps on being a coward.)I can assure you that his book, if he even really wrote it, is no different.What a pathetic, cowardly, liar of a little boy."
4,Solid - does not feel cheap.,"Not sure how much you can tell from the feel of a speaker but this one is solid & heavy. Probably means a good magnet & the sound so far seems more than adequate. Of course it is surrounded by front left/right speakers & sub-woofer but if I put my head next to it the music sounds crisp & clear.So the real test now will be time. The two front speakers my sister gave me are also BIC & she never had a problem with them. Looks like her cats got a hold of them a few times but Oh Well, we live in a dog house & as long as stuff works the aesthetics aren't too important. This Center speaker does have an appealing look if that matters.Not going to give it 5 stars yet. Will try to post back in a year if it still functions well. Before if we incur any problems."
2,Truly not as spectacular as I had hoped,"I love to cook for gatherings and thought this book would be interesting. It does give helpful suggestions, as previously mentioned by other reviewers, for types of gatherings, side dishes, etc. There just seemed to be something lacking for me. It's not the fact that every recipe does NOT include a picture. I own more cookbooks than my local library and not all of them have pictures. I just didn't seem to be overly impressed with the recipes in this book. For instance, the lasagna recipe, there's nothing impressive about the contents and I make a far better five cheese lasagna. Most of these recipes one could find on a free internet recipe site. Perhaps this book is better suited for a complete novice in terms of cooking and entertaining."
4,Cooking,"This is a wonderful book that shows you how to expand receipes. I will try out the stews as soon as it get cold around here, right now I'm grilling so the salads and meats are most important. Like the book a lot. I like the book because she has done all the work for you. Gives you list of everything you need to put a meal together, wines, cheeses, desserts....etc...simple to use."
4,Great for youngsters,"I found this book very helpful and informative for my kindergarten class. It is both simplistic enough for them to grasp the information and stay ""engaged"" as well as, complex enough for children to learn several attributes of a starfish...and remember it! There is also a great activity supplied at the end of the book. It's been a winner for me at home and at school. Great for beginners to science."
3,borderline junk,pops open very easily so we're afraid when we hit a bump on the boat it will keep popping open. that's what you get for 10 bucks though.
4,50/50 Sweatpants,"Recently purchased 2 pair of these sweatpants. the fit is great, comfortable, and perfect length. they wash well, no shrinkage."
4,exactly as advertised,"just like the product description says: sweatpants, no pockets. nothing more, nothing less. a medium to lightweight fabric."
2,Well made but...,"I like my sweats to fit very roomy to hang around the house so I ordered them quite large. I find that for the size ordered, these sweats run very small. I gave them away."
1,Less than expected,I am not very happy with the sweat pants. They pilled up after the first wash and the threading in the waist area started to come apart as well.
1,Impossible to order without size info,"I need to order some sweat pants. When I checked for size info, they were listed by chest size only. Who buys sweat pants by chest size?Even on the items that list waist size, there is no info for length. I have very short legs, and without length info, I can't buy.Before everyone jumps on me for not reviewing the PRODUCT.... How can I do that if I can't find the info I need for an order? There is no place here to to mention this EXCEPT in a review."
3,"Not ""real"" sweats","I didn't have any problems with sizing as other's did, but these are not ""real"" sweatpants. The insides are not fleece, but some other material, and I miss having the pockets. I will not buy these again."
4,Sweat pants,"These are sweat pants. I would have liked them better if they had pockets in them, but they were not advertised to have pockets so I can't fault them for that."
4,Still my favorite but....,"I still like these sweats more than any other. However, this is probably the second or third time I've bought these and the quality gets a little flimsier each time. I still own a couple pairs that I bought years ago and they are much thicker. Until I can find another brand that is as comfortable, however, I will stick with Jerzees."
2,cuts vary,"unfortunately, the cuts on these sweats vary, so one siz small might fit, while the next might not. other than that, i like them"
2,Bloomin Sweats,"These pants are of a very baggy design, no pockets, extra long as well. Not designed for the shorter, thin person."
4,"HEXED Puts Comic Spoof on INSTINCT, ATTRACTION","Claudia Christian steps into the role of world famous model, Hexina, in a fresh take on erotic suspense thrillers. Only HEXED is neither erotic nor suspenseful. It's a hilarious send-up on FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT where a lowly desk clerk learns that the woman of his dreams is a homicidal maniac. Most of the fun comes from Arye Gross who tries to live his day to day life as someone who actually has a life. When he intercepts a call to meet the beautiful, Hexina, he gets more than he bargained for.If you enjoy campy comedies with little storylines, but fun characters, you'll get your money's worth with HEXED."
5,One of the FUNNIEST movies EVER!,"I will do away with all the descriptions of the plot, it has been done in other reviews to my satisfaction. Take my advice, this is one of the best comedies I have ever had the satisfaction of watching...over and over and over again! I have been a fan of Claudia Christian's (Hexina in the film) since she was on Babylon 5 as Susan Ivanova. Do yourself a big favor and watch this gem if you can find it. I treasure my VHS edition and I had to get it used. Want the DVD edition to hurry up and be released!"
3,Unusual,Seems some of the obvious steps the main character Smoke would have taken much more time to even the odds with more vigilance under the threats that existed. Now wondering about Pearlie
5,"Wonderful, fresh look at Argentina's Dirty War","Taylor has created beautiful book out of a horrendous period in Argentina. She is a wonderful writer, and the book left me with a prfound sense of sadness and a desire to save the world. I am currently studying the Dirty War and I found this book has been the meat of my studies. She looks at the Dirty War at many different angles and ties them together masterfully. From its theatricality, its war against women, and what we, as Americans, must do as spectators to this Dirty War, Taylor urges that the spectators have the greatest role of all. Even twenty years after the war has ended, Taylor has created a book that forces Americans to evaluate our situation as spectators and contributors to the darkest period of Argentina's recent history. A must read...the book is easy to understand even if you know next to nothing about Argentina."
5,Cats love it,"The box was mangled, I don't know if it was the shippers fault or the packers fault, but man o man I can't believe the cans did not get squished. However, I have learned that you should not feed a steady diet of tuna to cats, so be sparring when you use this."
3,Book review,I liked this book. As a development manager I used it to look at various agile techniques and also ensured that my software dev and QA team read it. I think it gives a good managerial view and gives you solid insight.I am even referencing it in my blog [...]I would recommend this read.
3,good graphics but too much on waterfall,"What caught my eye on seeing this on the bookshelf were the color of typography, the small notes near the edges of the page that summarized a paragraph, the good graphics and diagrams. It looked like a quality book. After seeing how long was the discussion on ""proving"" that waterfall methodology was too long, ""heavy"", slow, and projects that used it more prone to less-than-satisfying end results, I understood why this book is titled for managers. In fact, one of the sentences it mentions that the step-follow-step process of the waterfall was popularized in the 70's and 80's, age during which today's managers got their education. On the CMM of SEI, a brief mention on it was that it resembles the heavyness of waterfall. Wished I had a bit more on it, but did learn from it anyway. The very last paragraph of the book had information I wanted: it was about Fitnesse, but it was just too little."
4,Great Managers Guide,"A great management overview of the agile processes. I found this to be an excellent intro to the core methodologies. Easy read with well defined sections if you are only looking for specific guidance. It is bit light on best practice implementation details. That being said, this is a good start for transitioning into an agile shop."
3,Tough Sell to Experienced Managers,"The book is well written and helpful in understanding differences between various models. As a PM of 15 years on large to small projects involving SW / HW / System solutions, and involving small to large development organizations, I felt the points stated as driving these methodologies are based on assumptions not entirely true. In the book, many principles / practices are presented as agile / iterative, but these factors also apply to traditional methods, and in most cases involve good management practices regardless of methodology. I felt the material is theoretical avoiding practical issues involving the organizational constraints managers face. While the book makes a strong case for Agile, it failed to convince me that Agile is better than other traditional approaches, simply different, and therefore perhaps appropriate for some projects."
5,Mouth watering !!,"I am a Husband of a Wife who loves this book. I am the recipient of some awesome meals my wife has prepared with the help of this book. Unfortunatly the copy she has, she borrowed. I have just placed an order. My wife does not cook often but, it seems that the book is the reason. So shes getting one with my Love. In my humble opinion there is no better cook book. The meals created from this are as good or better than any you would find in a 4 star restaurant ."
4,"Not Super Sturdy, But a Good Value For the Price.","We have had a difficult time finding curtain rods in this size at a reasonable price. This isn't super-strong, but looks nice and works fine."
2,"The review of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.:","Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro American Studies Department at Harvard, called the book ""the bible of the new anti-Semitism."" Gates said the book ""massively misrepresents the historical record, largely through a process of cunningly selective quotation of often reputable sources..."" and charges that the book suggests reported misdeeds by Jews are ""the signs of an essential nature that is evil."""
2,A Book For Ideas,This book is helpful to have on the bookshelf for anyone looking for new ideas. I did not find that it really treated its subject in any depth.
1,Same old stuff,"I purchased this book and I want my money back. The book is clearly written, yet it repeats and repeats things which we all know and things the author keeps repeating in all his well-worn works. Instead of 200-plus pages, it could have been done in 20."
5,An excellent disc.,"This is one of my favorite cds that i currently have in my collection. In this cd the dandy warhols put out a variety of songs. Some that are faster and more rock and others that are more slow and soulful. This is truly a musical journey. There is one consitency through out the album and that is that every song is good. Some of the better tunes are Bohemian Like You, Godless, and Mohammed. On the whole this is a disc that is slower and perfect to listen to if your looking to chillout. I would say that there is a good chance that you would like this cd if your into bands like the beatles, oasis , or radiohead."
4,Catchin' Up,"This was the second Dandy Warhols album that I purchased, the first being Welcome To The Monkey House. I didn't listen to Welcome much post my purchase however after getting into Thirteen I have spent many hours listening to it. Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia should go down in history as one of the best ""new"" music albums of our times. This album has everything from swirling guitar progressions to hard driving rock to knees up country numbers. I love it and think that I will always go back for more. This is a must have album for your collection and I can recommend it without hesitation."
4,Dandys Still Rule OK,"I'm only on my third spin on 13tfub... that means the listening ratio to the first two albums is about 1/1000... so the differences between those albums 13 Tales are what stand out immediately. The first impression is that the Dandys haven't made a departure from their old style, though some may argue with that. It's undeniably Dandy music, but with a new complexity and texture. And a lot of the songs (probably all of them, actually,) still concern themselves mainly with sex and drugs"" the ventricles of rock n roll"" but they keep the ironic, intelligent, perspective that separates them from the smelly yellow water of the mainstream."
2,not a great cd,its good but u cant listen too much....after a time you want to stop it.tracks 1-2-8 are good. save your money.....
4,Good music.,"If all cuts were as good as ""Bohemian Like You"", then it would deserve even a 6 star rating... but not all songs are like it, which doesn't mean you'll find a really bad one in here; it's just you won't find any better.However it's still a well crafted and carefully produced album, worth listening and recommended for any Dandy Warhols' newcomer and fan.Good music."
4,Good Not Great,"I was hoping to find out more information on why THE COMPLETE EPIC has never been released on DVD. If its never going to be released then please release ALL THE DELETED FOTAGE on DVD. This is still scenes that are in the EPIC that have never been released on DVD.I also wanted to see more information aboout ""The Godfather: Part III"". I know its not very good however I would to of known more about the film and how the cast feels about it."
4,Solid Player,"I've had this DVD player for 2 years and have watched hundreds of movies so far. Its behind in the technology curve now, but its reliability and quality are good indicators of the whole Toshiba line. I'm particularly impressed with the picture quality when matched to my Toshiba television set using the compositve video outputs - significantly better than the standard coax output and S-video output. The one down side is that it doesn't play any VCD format disks. My goal was to convert all my 8mm video to VCD format so that I could play them in my DVD, but I was unsuccessful. After scouring web sites I found that the Pioneer DVD players seem to provide the best support for playing all the diffent DVD formats, so that's what I'll probably buy in the future. However, if you're looking for a solid entry-level player - this one is it."
3,toshiba 2109,I have a dvd that I burned from my church service I can play it on any player any computer but it won't work on the toshiba 2109.
1,Disappointing,I planted mine in a separate area next to my yellow and mixed color sunflowers and they never sprouted. (shrugs) I wonder if I got an old batch of seeds.
4,Great product!,I am a long time musician and I love the full balanced sound of these speakers! I paired these with a 1976 Kenwood receiver that I purchased on ebay and I couldn't be happier. I prefer these over more expensive speakers that I have owned in the past. It's difficult to understand how these could be produced at the price they sell for. My vote...... buy em!
1,Speaker arrived with a broken tweeter,"Nice enough looking units and better than average sound,however I can't overlook the fact that one speaker arrived with the tweeter separated from the faceplate. It attaches with four clips and glued on with epoxy,obviously not a solid solution. I contacted customer service and was basically got no satisfaction. Most companies I assume would have shipped another tweeter without a second thought. I would not deal with this company again"
2,What Bass?,"I thought these speakers were going to awesome from the great reviews but I was really disappointed.They lack so much bass, it was weird. Oh well, they are going back. Nothing works like a sub, so that's the next order."
3,bic speakers,"I own the same model, except it has different letter model prefix. Product appearance in regards to exterior visual finish is mediocre. The inherrent value is found not in manufacturing achievement, or audio excellence compared to high priced esoteric speakers of which I also own, but in the value that these have in sound quality for such a low price.These have been used daily in my bedroom theatre for over 7 years and have been decent sounding and reliable at high listening levels. These speakers will not disapoint at price point compared to other chaff produced by large manufacturers at this price point such as bestbuy/circuit city etc. If you are looking for inexpensive speakers with high quality manufacturing and sound accuracy, purchase energy speakers for another $20. Energy is not discounted via mail order/internet, so you will have to go to authorized dealer."
4,Good Bang for the $$$,I just purchased a pair of these on 7/13/07 to replace the smaller BIC DV-52SIB's. When I opened the box one of the speaker grills was damaged. But not enough for some good ole super glue. The frame of the grill was broken on one side and a few small pieces also. I just glued the frame and other pieces back in place and let the grill dry overnight. The next morning they were good as new. But the speakers themselves were is excellent shape. I'm using these as rear surround speakers in an eleven speaker 7.1 system. I put the DV52SIB's in the master bedroom system and use the DV62si's in their place upstairs in the bonus room.The sound is great for a small speaker at this price. They have good bass response for a small rear fill speaker. I'll give it some more time before judging them. But good so far.
5,Excellent Speakers for the Money,"I needed some very small speakers for my home theater for the left/right front channels. (Small size needed due to 2:35 to 1 projection screen lower edge about 18"" from the floor.) These were perfect. They replace two KLH-33's from the '60's. They prove once and for all that name brands are generally way over-priced- you are paying for a name.The other speakers in contention were Sony's, also excellent for the money, but they were a little too big.In sum, great speakers at a bargain price!"
3,How strong is this carafe?,"I really like the Cuisinart coffee make which I purchased early in 2010. I broke the carafe, when I was washing it,with my washing ""mop"". So be careful."
2,Cuisinart replacement Coffee Carafe,"This carafe appears to be identical to the original carafe, and it fits the coffee maker as it should. The problem is that this carafe has a plastic rim/lid that does not seal to the glass bottom properly. Every time I pour coffee, it dribbles out of the carafe onto my counter, not from the spout, but from below the plastic rim. The original carafe did not have this problem, and I wish I could afford the ten day turnaround time it would likely take to return this one. But I don't, so I just keep a towel handy every time I pour coffee. If only there was a way to get an advance replacement, and some assurance that the new unit would perform as it should, but there is not. So I'm stuck with a dribbling carafe. Maybe it's time for an all new coffee maker, but perhaps not the Cuisinart brand?"
4,Good Replacement,"It fits, and seems to be exactly like the old one in the coffee maker. We use it mostly for tea so we like keeping it very clear to see the tea's color to adjust the concentration of the tea. Unfortunately because it's glass, and we keep it near the stove, it could break again."
1,Don't by the coffe maker in the first place,"Bought this Cuisinart coffee maker on sale at Kohl's for under $80.00 It was stylish and fit our kitchen decor. The coffee maker itself brews well, but the warming plate is poor at the highest settings. This is the 3rd carafe we have replaced in less than 4 years. The handle is wobbely and the glass is really thin. If you are buying it for looks, its OK, if you are buying it for quality, Mr. Coffee probably makes a better product for 1/2 the price. Mark & Mern,Yuba City, CA"
3,A necessary replacement carafe,"I accidentally broke the carafe that came with my Cusinart 12-cup Coffee Maker when it bumped into a coffee mug. The glass seems quite thin, but once it needed replacing I figured I should go with the model that was made for the coffee maker.It was only after I received the carafe that I read the reviews and realized that many other people were having the same problem of the carafe being too delicate. It really does feel quite fragile, which is unfortunate considering the cost. I wouldn't be too surprised if this replacement broke as easily as the first. If that does happen I might consider replacing the coffee maker and finding another model with a stronger carafe."
2,"Great coffee maker, but carafe breaks easily","Sadly, this is the 3rd carafe I have purchased after breaking two just in the process of cleaning them. Very thin glass. This time I am handling it like fine china. Cuisinart needs to increase the quality of the carafes. Next breakage will be the last time I bother to buy a new one. But, on the good side, Amazon got the new carafe to me quickly and safely!"
5,Replacement Carafe,"First off, ordered this item on Wednesday afternoon..standard delivery (5-7 days)and received it less then 48 hours later.After hitting my carafe against the sink 1 two many times (over several years) it did finally crack. the original took a beating and lasted. A new low end Coffee Maker could be bought for the same price as this replacement carafe, but I like my Cusinart brewer, it stays on for 4 hours if needed...New Models ALL turn off at 2 HOURS.If you like your Brewer, get the replacement carafe. If you don't care, go to Target, Wal-mart or Sears"
4,nice pot..but...,the ONLY thing I don't like about this pot is the way you open the lid (from the handle)...afraid I'll break a nail..:-( ...otherwise handle is comfortable.
2,Breaks too easily!,"This is my second time in 1 year having to buy this. The glass breaks way too easy. The machine is fine but you are stuck having to buy replacement carafes that are just as expensive as some other makers! Due to time limitations I will purchase my second replacement. However, I will be looking for another coffee maker in the not too distant future."
5,Just like the original!,"Ordered this, then read reviews after. Was worried because so many said the glass was lesser quality than the original. Not sure what they are seeing, it's just like the original! I still had my original Carafe since only the black handle had broken on it. Compared it to this replacement and it's exactly the same. Same thickness of the glass, same handle and design. Very pleased!"
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200PRC 12 Cup Replacement Carafe,Took a while to receive but it was packed well. This replacement carafe is overpriced.
3,Bought as a replacement,"OK. I break coffee carafes. I bought this one to have as a back up since I know I'll need it presently.I agree that it's a bit expensive, but the coffee maker it goes with make great tasting coffee so I'll suffer. What I really don't like about it (and why it get's 3-stars instead of four) is the plastic/glass interface at the top. It retains water/coffee/SOAPY WATER!!!"
4,Cuisinart Coffee Pot,I think Cuisinart coffee pots make the best coffee by far. The only drawback is that you HAVE to buy the exact carafe replacement and they are not carried in any stores. You must get it from Cuisinart carriers.
4,Minor annoyance,Generally I have been satisfied with this carafe. However I think the glass is very thin making cleaning the carafe a too careful job. Another minor annoyance is the little edge inside the top of the carafe. When I leave the cleaned but wet carafe upside down in my drying rack and eventually turn it right side up to put it away there is still water in this edge that drips down into the dry bottom.
5,Good carafe,My old carafe decided to come apart at the handle. Ordered this one and we are back in business enjoying our morning java!
1,Carafe will crack - not well tempered glass - 3rd replacement in months,OK - really like the coffee maker but the carafe cracks.I am on carafe number 3.Either very cheap glass or it is not tempered correctly.Bummer to pay $80 for the coffee maker and I am now over $40 into replacement carafes.Recommend you try a different brand machine due to carafe.Frustrated.......
4,Calc Review,"Works great, bought it for my 10 year old required it for school work - works as expected, no issues."
3,"Good Summary of Texts, Interpretations Questionable","This compilation affords readers without access to major Celtic Studies collections at universities the opportunity to examine translations of many Celtic stories of mythic importance.That said, there is one section that I must discuss.The materials relating to the Cauldron of Poesy found in this book are very close to those that my wife, Erynn Laurie and I published in 1992, including the diagrams. While I am not asserting plagarism, let me note that John Matthews did meet us in 1993, and we discussed this material for some time, and presented him with a copy of our book ""The Cauldron of Poesy Lectures"" and a copy of an earlier version of Circle of Stones. I know that Caitlin Matthews read the Cauldron of Poesy lectures, because she sent us a thank you note. Despite this, we are not listed in the source bibliography at the end of the book."
5,Absolutely the best!!!,"I have tried many facewashes that weren't a scrub but decided I needed to try one since, though I have oily skin, I get dry patches with flaky, dull skin. I tried this product and absolutely loved it. It is a thick and grainy scrub that feels so good as it warms up. I had tried another scrub previously that dried out my skin. This does leave a moisturizer on your face that takes a bit to get used to, since you feel it as soon as you rinse. But it makes your skin feel SO smooth and moisturized after your skin is dry, and this feeling lasts. It took care of my dry patches while slightly moisturizing. Highly recommended!!"
4,Loved it,Love this series! Just found this author and Like what I've read from her. You should read all the books in this series.
5,"Little Known ABC album, but maybe their best!","Wow! I read one of the other reviews and thought I'd give it a try. What a wonderful surprise! Next to Lexicon of Love, this album is probably their best. Incredible uplifting songwriting and arrangements, Martin's voice sounds amazing. Grab it while you can."
5,ME TOO,"I, also, was in the Mall of America many years ago with my mom (she died 11 years ago so it was at least 12 years) and I, too, heard this beautiful piano playing. I LOVE it. I have dozens of Christmas CDs and this is my very favorite."
2,Go for Audio-Technica,"In the price range, these are reasonable wireless mics, but don't expect to get any reception if you're are running more than 2 wireless mics at a time. If you're set on this price range, check out the Audio Technica counterpartsAudio-Technica PRO88W-R35 VHF Wireless Microphone System for Camcorder UseThese are better mic quality and have better reception - they are a little more expensive, but are worth the upgrade. These mics are great for use with camcorders - I have used both Azdens and Audio-Technica mics with my sony XDCAM and the Azdens work OK, but the Audio Technica's just work and sound better and pickup almost no background noise."
3,One VERY BIG downside,"If you use this mic in ""short"" mode, you'll be fine. The quality is pretty impressive.Forget about the ""long"" mode. It's worse than your internal mic on your DSLR or Camcorder.Now... the big downside.This mic does not have a light indicator that tells you whether the mic is on or off. Bad, bad, absolutely bad.If your battery is out, you won't know if it is out when you turn on the mic because there's no indicator.You'll be filming with the mic switch turned to 'on', when in contrast, the mic will be off because the battery would be out.After a great shoot, when you playback what you shot, you'll only get 'silence'.VERY BAD DESIGN.However, taking only one AA battery to run this mic is a big plus. Makes the mic very light in weight."
3,Works Fine,Fun little additional to my cameras. Collects focused sound or ambient sound. Keep a pack of batteries with you at all times.
5,I highly recommend this book,"Well, TPR has maintained its flawless superior reputation. This book is excellent! Forget about education; this book has it all. Thanks to it, I will score a 5. The other books can not compare. The easy to read format and the humor inside are excellent. Thank you TPR"
3,Worth $20,"This is a great buy for tweny dollars, but not more than that. The game is a bit ridiculous, like most movie games and makes little sense at various moments throughout the story. There is a lot of button mashing; however, the graphics make up for it."
5,Works great with Channel Plus 3025,"I purchased a Channel Plus 3025 to power 4 other TVs off a single Direct TV (DTV) SD Box. I found some 2133 remote IR senders cheap on ebay. I purchased this Channel Plus 2172 to complete the setup and it works great. The 2172 on ebay cost more than from this seller on amazon. The one thing I could not find stated anywhere is once the IR head was placed over the DTV Box, could it accept a local IR signals from a remote control. It works, I guessed it would, but never having used a setup like this I had no way to know for sure. Now, I can control the DTV channel in the garage, back porch, workshop, or basement. Plus, I can see output of DTV HD DVR or my Blu-Ray player on any connected TV. Its not HDTV, but I only have to pay one $5 box fee. There are only two people in the house and I am the only one who use the TV in the extra rooms. I already send enough to DTV, thou its way less than I send to TimeWarner."
4,The right bit for the weird job,"First, there's no screw driver, only bits. However, it's got every single security bit ever. AND not just security bits either, but regular bits, or bits that you can used for rusted, jammed, or treated screws. Do yourself a favor, when you buy it, keep a piece of cardboard between the sections when you close it. That way, you can keep the bits in place. It has an extender that you can use for a screwdriver or a drill. Magnetic too. Fours stars for no driver and the need for a cardboard slat. It doesn't say on there anywhere, but I'm pretty sure it's made in the USA."
4,Another Decent Tool,Wuest's Translation of the new testament is not the best out there but it is a solid companion to the Rotherham's for laymen and clergy alike.I have had cause to refer to this tool in order to expand my understanding of knotty passages of the new testament. I recommend it as a solid addition to one's library of study aids and tools.
4,Good for Study,This version of the New Testament is good if you want to get more detail for certain verses. But it is not good to read as you would the King James or NKJ or NIV or NRSV because the wording (order) is too difficult to follow.So read it as an aid...but that's all.
5,"Lazzi, excellent book","This is a great book if you are interested in Commedia dell'Arte, particularly if you really want to know what the performances were like. It's an easy quick read and very enjoyable. Great for theater majors."
3,Not what I thought but still cute,"I thought that this puppy was the larger puppy, which now I know is named Yodeler. I wanted it as a replacement-double for my daughter so she can have one at daycare and one at home. This one is still cute, but is a little larger than palm size, so I don't know if she will like it as much. It is still the same material as the other one, so maybe since it is really soft she will. The product itself arrived in a plastic sealed bag and was definitely new, so the product itself isn't bad, just not what I thought it was going to be."
1,"looks good, but doesn't work","This meat grinder looked like the kind my mother had that worked very well. However,after it was assembled it did not grind beef or lamb chunks evenly, but turned them to mush that jammed the grinder mechanism."
1,disappointed,"I was looking for a meat grinder for a long time and trusted the trade name; the tool is rusted, does not work properly, I will return it"
2,Not as helpful as I thought,"I bought this book thinking it would help me to understand what the schools know, only to find out that the Department of Education has not yet released the regulations. My district now tells me these federal regulations are what our state uses to make determinations on their own regulations. So while this book does give information about the law (and as another reviewer stated, it can be found on the Internet for free), it does not directly address federal or state regulations, since they have not yet been created. So, I found the book only marginally helpful, thus two stars for a good effort."
4,Donut Maker,"This one you have to make sure your batter is just right, not too thick and not too thin. You have to play with it. The recipes that come with it are ok, nothing to brag about though. Want to try a different recipe than those given. I have yet to master it, but I'm not giving up ...... yet."
2,"Not just cheap to buy, cheap looking too..","I bought three of these. Opening the box, I realized that these shirts have a weaved striped pattern running vertically on the cloth, which is not visible on amazon's images of the product.It just looks cheap IMHO. I wish they either offer better pictures or do a better job of item description. Based on other extreme like/dislike reviews, my guess is either you are going to like them or hate them."
3,pretrty good,pretty good but the handheld mic is cheesy plastic and has no switch on off still the clip on works well as does the handheld when on a stand
3,Azden WMS[-Pro Wireless Mic,"This product isn't as good as I had hoped. I read a lot of reviews and listened to sample audio taken from this mic before I purchased it, but the quality I get when I use it isn't nearly as nice as the samples I listened to. I've used it several times in several different environments, and there is a pretty strong static sound in the background no matter the range or the channel I use. So any audio I take from it has to be taken into an audio editing program and cleaned up quite a bit (much more than just standard audio editing) to make it sound more natural. It does pick up voices pretty well, and the range is good, but I can't get a clean audio track which is what I was hoping for when I purchased the mic."
4,Decent for the price,"At under the $500 level there are few choices in lapel wireless microphones. I have two Azden WMS-PRO sets and have used them with very good success. I wish you could put two transmitters on the same frequency but the signal interference is a little too random. So in those cases I put each one on it's own frequency and then use a Y-cable to bring them back together.The most important thing missing is a power meter to let you know, at least relatively, where you are in the overall battery life."
2,not as good as I thought it would be!,"I had great hopes for this organizer but although it saves to Microsoft Outlook, it changes the order of the words. Search therefore is difficult in the organizer's address book. It also doesn't allow the user to scroll except by individual name. There used to be better ones!"
3,"For the money, it does what I need","I didn't expect much from this PDA, considering the cost. I just wanted to record some memos. I haven't tried syncing it up to Outlook or anything that complicated. If you think of it merely as just a handy tool to quickly jot down notes, you won't be disappointed. I suspect, from the complaints I've seen about it, when people paid the full price and expected to download emails from Outlook, that's where the product faltered fro them. In all honesty, it would make a great gift for a 10-12 year old. It's impressive looking, but the price ($12.99) can't be beat...just don't expect too much from it."
2,"Good price, but frustrating","I've had an OZ-590A for a couple of years- a gift from my lovely wife.At first, after a bit of a learning curve, I got it to work.But winthin the last year and a half, no matter what I do, it will import addresses from Outlook, but in triplicate! So they're all there, but when I need to find someone, I spend 20 minutes wading through the multiple entries. I put up with it but would never buy this again. The time is sync'ed, Outlook is running, and almost everything is shut down (at work we cannot shut off McAffee fully- and really shouldn't have to. On the other hand, I've sucessfully imported before! So something changed but I don't have a clue what it is). Using XP Pr 2002 SP2."
1,Never received the product,"I never received the product. I emailed the company twice to ask what happened and never received a reply so I would rate that company as very, very poor. Amazon's service however was terrific as they refunded my purchase price quickly."
3,My 2 cents,"The organizer is about what I expected. I would have preferred a qwerty keyboard for finger use, but this one is OK."
1,Synchro problems,The software will not load correctly on my networked printer. There is no synchronization
1,Sharp Wizard Organizer,"Lousy! The screen has multiple vertical and horizontal ""grid lines"" that preclude seeing data that is entered where these lines appear!"
4,Not so bad.,"I gave up a couple of times on trying to sync this with my PC, but in one review here (thank you so much) a person mentioned that the clock has to be set to the same time as the PC. After that it's simple:*Set the time.*Load the software on the PC.*Plug in USB, then organizer; power on organizer.*Auto detect serial port.*Download database, sync with Outlook, etc.I believe that was all I had to do and it works flawlessly. Hopefully this will help others, don't give up on this handy, inexpensive organizer until trying this.My four star rating instead of five is only because I don't use Outlook Express and a couple of the organizer's features..."
4,Nice But.....,"Item was received in good time and works great but, they forgot to include the ""stylus"" that goes with it. I sent an email but never received a response or the stylus. Nevertheless it was worth it and works fine with the tip of a pen and I have plenty of those. Still, stylus would have been nice too."
1,Sharp Wizard OZ-590 Organizer,I did not receive this item. I paid for a new organizer and received a refurbished one. I contacted the company and then sent the refurbished item back. They could not locate a new one so my money has been refunded.
4,Excellent product for the asking price.,This item is exactly what I wanted. I'm hoping the asking price will effect the electronic organizer industry. I only had an issue with Microsoft Outlook. Make sure you syncronize (MO) with a personal file. I bought two of them!
4,So far so good,"I bought this a month back, and it has been good so far.1. As mentioned the display is not good when compared to other PDAs. It is simple LCD display, when it becomes almost impossible to view in bright light.2. It syncs fine with my outlook.3. The interface for the schedules list is not quite user-friendly. It just mentions the time of the appointments but not the date in the list.4. Not user-friendly to enter data using the device. I always enter the data in my computer and then sync it to the device.Overall it is very much worth for its cost."
1,Not Satisfied,"I was very dissatisfied with this product. Mostly, the screen was very difficult to view and there were not enough options for data entry such as changing the keyboard. Also, trying to sync with Outlook was easy, but it does not sync everything correctly. I returned the product...thank goodness for amazon!"
3,Average PDA,"This PDA is good for people with a lot of phone numbers to store.It has good memory for the money and has a good scheduler, phonebook, and expense function.Overall, I loved it when I got it, and to tell you the truth, it gets boring after a few weeks.Compare this to the Sharp OZ290H, which costs near $30, that's pretty good compared to this.(This pda costs near $50)Although that pda has less memory, it has dieatary functions like carb and fat counters, it also has a bulit in pedometer. I think that's pretty cool.This is an average pda, good for a first-time pda buyer.The pc sync is very compicated, but can be done."
1,Disappointed/description lies,Very cute idea but the description lies. They r under 6 inches long and under 1 inch deep. Not at all what I expected given the description says 7x1.8 inches. Would return but out if time. Will make a nice decoration later. Do not buy.
5,Wedding,"EXACTLY what I was looking for, great size! Package came a little squished on the one corner and I was worried, but it was perfectly fine"
4,All That Drama,"Boy oh boy, just when you think things couldnt get any worse. I really enjoyed this book, I just didnt like the ending. Sammie had a bunch of drama in her life, and Marie was right there trying to hold her together. To bad the book didnt get into more detail of why Sammie's mother didnt like her or why the kids didnt like the grandmother. I just couldnt believe the ending of this book... Im about to read Lawd more drama, and I hope that will shed some light on the first book,"
5,All That Drama,I enjoyed this book. Sammie and Marie are good friends. Sammie is a risk taker while Marie is the voice of reason. This book will have you not want to put it down until the end. As Sammie goes throgh her drama filled life Marie is there to offer sound advice. The ending will throw you for a loop. A GREAT read. Savvy Book Club
2,Nice weight ski sweater,"Got a great deal on this sweater a couple years ago. Its lighter weight than my other sweaters, more fitted, not as long nor loose."
1,What the ....?,I have been a Toto fan for 20 years way back to the original Toto album and even as backup musicians for the likes of Boz Skaggs. This album is terrible. Why would some of the best songwriters in the business feel the need to do cover songs?Glad to have Bobby Kimball back and look forward to some grass roots rock from them soon. My advice....don't buy this album unless you listen to it first. This is not the Toto we love.
3,Not the recent theatrical release,"This is a decent documentary, but it is NOT the recent feature length film.It is by the same director, which is misleading.I would wait until march to get the actual theatrical release, as it tells the same story, but with more recent and dramatic events folded in."
2,Knowledge can't be inherited.,"The little old man may well know most of the stuff in this book. Besides being the boss' son Yip Chun really tries to pass his knowledge and philosophy to the readers, unfortunately with poor results. I'm a beginner in Wing Chun and it really was a bit disappointing try to figure out some techniques, specially when the text is not in harmony with the pictures. The author may know the art very well, but this book makes the reader wonder how the Grand Master Yip Man - the author's father - would handle such matter. Try it if you spare some bucks."
4,Good but not near enough,"This reads more like an introduction to the art of Wing Chun ratehr than a book covering the ""principles"". So much is left out. It would be better presented as Vol I, and then have the authors do a more comprehensive series. Just a suggestion."
2,"unimpressed, I am returning it!","With such excellent reviews of this VCR I did not expect any problems...unfortunatly I was wrong. The VCR boasts a cable box controller that is supposed to ""bounce"" off your walls to control the box. This feature did not work with my standard cable box unless the box teetered off the side so its sensor was directly over the VCRs sensor (whickh is placed on the left top corner of the VCR instead of the middle). The setup and program features are archaic and the remote buttons are awkwardly placed."
3,Almost fit,Had to bend edge of back corner with sledge hammer and neck is off about inch and half from center of hole.
2,What a Disappointment!,"I had looked forward to this book very much. I am fascinated with books and their history, and the background and subject matter give this book an entirely different level for enjoyment.But I have had it with the hero: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who ""have been sworn to secrecy"" or who ""just want to protect him"" boggle the imagination. It's time he stood up to his ""friends"" and said, ""Enough already."" Unless of course he enjoys being the fool."
2,lorikeets,i was disappointed in this book. I just got a new lorikeet and was hoping this book would have lot of information for me. It wasn't as informative for a new pet owner. Maybe if the title was different. Like how to breed them.Not for a new pet owner.
5,A book to save your life,"I absolutely adore this series of books. I have bought them all, because they give me hope. If you're a person who is struggling to believe there is a Divine Force at work, these books will help you believe. I keep them handy and read the stories every day. I find it keeps my faith strong, and my life is going so much better now than it was a year ago. All kinds of good news comes to me every day. I believe I owe a lot of that to these wonderful authors and their wonderful series. And these books make fabulous and affordable gifts, too, for just about everyone. Buy them!"
4,"Romantic, heartwarming and soul searching",My husband and I share this book together. Each night before we go to sleep we lie in bed and read each other a story. One night he reads and I listen. The next night I read and he listens. Amidsts a hectic day it gives us something to come back to and discuss as the day is done.
3,"Quite Good, but some stories are not really relevant.",The book is quite good but not as touching as Chicken Soup for the Soul. Also some of the stories doesn't bare any special thoughts or relevance.
5,Phenomenal and Inspirational!,"I am not a big reader, never liked to, but I couldn't put this one down! I got it as a gift for Valentine's Day and what a gift! I mean, this book has completetely touched me deeply! I have never been so inspired in all of my life! Every comment rings true to everyday life! BRAVO to those two ladies for making this and I can't wait to read the sequels!What a great gift to give! I especially liked the comments..."
3,well made,"This camera bag is very well made and has a lot of padding. Your camera would be safe in here. Unfortunately, my lense (the regular lense) is almost too big to fit in here. I really have to pack the camera in. I had to go out and get a bag that would hold everything including my bigger lenses."
4,The next best thing to a new S&G-album,"The G returns to what he always been best at: collaborating with other musicians and lending his gorgeous voice to harmony vocals on well-written tunes. Only now he is in the front, although generously sharing the spotlight with his collaborators who do a great job. It is amazing and almost scary how often the record reminds me of the magic of the sixties-sound of S&G. Where his former partner seems to be looking for his form, Garfunkel has found his. A truly amazing feat for an artist who could have been resting on his laurels and singing Bridge (you know) on every thinkable occasion."
5,Art's best solo work,"I love Art Garfunkel and always get his albums. In recent years, however, those records just seem like collections of covers Art has lent his gorgeous voice to. What a surprise this one is! First of all, Art cowrote a number of these songs. Second, he seems to be thriving amid the collaboration with Sharp, Mondlock, and producer Buddy Mann. This is certainly his best solo album since WATERMARK (his collaboration with Jimmy Webb) and maybe his best ever. I love ""Bounce"" and ""The Thread"" especially. Way to go, Artie!"
3,It's OK,"You know and love those books that you just can't put down? This wasn't one of those for me. While I admit I walked away with a lesson learned (which is always a good thing)... I could not get interested in this book until about 3/4 the way through it. It was an OK read, but not high on my list of recommendations."
5,Extremely helpful,"I really enjoyed this book and found it very useful. Margaret Shepherd addresses just about any situation one can think of. If everyone owned this book and followed these conversational guidelines, the world would be a much better place."
1,"Poor Quality, Rusted, Not Interchangable - China Made!","Titan 16048 Quick-Disconnect 48 Piece Drilling and Driving Set in Plastic Case -We have 2 General Carpentry/Home Improvement shops, with every major brand of construction equipment possible, left over from our 'construction days', Now for our Vacation Properties in Hawaii, so we go thru a tons of Drills & Driving Sets, per year. We mostly purchase them from our local low's and home depo(sits) stores. This set was priced well, so I gave it a spin.In short, they were of Poor Quality, performed Poorly on Wood & Metal, and just like everything that is not of high-quality Steel or Stainless Steel, when exposed to the Ocean air, they Rusted after 3 months, plus the (Metric-size?) Coupler was Not Interchangeable, as someone else noted, with other Brand name drills, and it's China Made.At least with a Craftsman piece or tool, you can take any Tool back to Sears, and get a free replacement, with these you are SOL."
4,A dapper hat for a dapper chap,"If you consider yourself a replica buff, prepared to be mildly disappointed. This is not a precise replica of the hat in the film, and doesn't even fully match the photo provided; it does however resemble the hat well enough to work as a cheap costume hat and compliments the mask very well.The kicker is that this is in fact the actual licensed product, so the makers of the film signed off on a inaccurate knock off. It doesn't feel cheap, but it doesn't look quite right. It will, however, work for it's price and at a reasonable distance."
2,my fingers must be too small,seemed like a great idea but I guess my fingers are too small...would have to wear it on 3 of my fingers together (akward) and even then Im not confident it would stay on...and nothing puts a damper on a fast paced roller derby bout like a ref having to stop the action cause her whistle fell onto the track.
5,"A flourishing, joyous celebration","Jasmine In Her Hair: Culture And Cuisine From Pakistan blends enjoyable stories of culture and passion, mouth-watering Pakistani recipes, and beautiful color photographs to delight avid chefs seeking to create their own taste of Pakistan and cookbook collectors alike. Written by cooking school instructor Huma Siddiqui in order to share and perpetuate Pakistani traditions, Jasmine In Her Hair is a flourishing, joyous celebration, featuring such delectible dishes as Kofta (Beef Meatballs), Cholay (Spicy Chickpeas), Rasgullah (Cheese Balls In Sugar Syrup), and more, all heightened by the intriguing anecdotes of everyday life in Pakistan, from insights into the philosophy of Ramadan fasting to traditional wedding dress and much more. Highly recommended."
2,What where they thinking,"When I first saw the Dual Action Stylus, I thought ""ofcource, how brilliant"". So I when out a spend my hard earned money on this 30+ dollars assorie, for my loved Palm IIIx. But was I dissapointed. It's a bad (very bad), ordinary pen, and just a standard stylus for the Palm. A complete waste of money. Keep your stylus, and spend your money on a normal pen instead. (The only plus side is that it looks stunning)."
1,Very expensive drinking straw,"...I was looking forward to a heavy duty, well constructed useful item. This wasn't it. As in the earlier review, it looks kind of cool, but feels like a drinking straw in your hand. It is so light as to feel hollow, doesn't feel like it would stand up to a stiff wind, let alone daily use. Shame on Palm for producing such outstanding products, and then putting their name on a piece of garbage like this. This only receives one star, because Amazon won't allow less."
5,Full of Great Ideas!,Ingrid Newkirk has written a fine and interesting book. It is full of sound ideas and suggestions for our feline companions. I'm actually having trouble figuring out if I'm enjoying the book more or my cat.
4,Superior Practical Advice For Cat Caretakers,"Ingrid Newkirk gives excellent practical advice on the physical & emotional care of cats.The average person may find some of the advice over the top but true cat lovers will be relieved to know that they are not alone in their devotion. My only disagreement would be her recommendation of a vegetarian diet.While I do have concerns about the content of commercial cat food, I feel that while humans can thrive without meat...cats probably cannot. It's also a bit of a leap of faith to expect that the average person can be counted on to ensure the cat consistently receives all the proper vitamins & minerals it needs. All in all an excellent book."
1,PETA,"Ingrid Newkirk (the author) is the President of PETA and a militant-type activist. No wonder she thinks cats can be vegetarian!! Love and respect animals and pets, and be informed- but please, don't be a freak.There are many other books available by people who are still sane and care about animal welfare."
1,Worthless propaganda from a cat murderer...,"Anyone who takes this book's advice will lose thier cat to death in 6 months...Garenteed.What else can you expect from a woman who wants to ban all pet ownership and Servuce animals for the disabled?Yes, I am one of those ""loathsome creatures"" that enslaves a dog to be my eyes. If dear Ingrid had her way, my best friend in life would be taken away from me, and every other visually impaired person on earth who dared to have one.And this woman claims to love animals... Meh."
2,Not up to Par.,"Unforturnately, like others before me have noted, there is not much on the market to do bi-directional signals with this many outputs. So far 3 out of the 4 I have tried do not send a signal from the target thru the amplifier/splitter to the device. I'll keep sending one back until I get a second one working as I have 16 TV's and need many outputs."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book looking for some stories about players, about the game of baseball, about the human side of it. I bought it for my son for his 11th birthday. I bought the wrong book. This book is NOT appropriate for anyone under 16, and not for many over 16. I'm sure many players use profanity, but almost every story had more than enough. One story led up to a player and his girl going through the trauma of a backroom abortion (where is the baseball in that?), another ended with the picture of a player sliding headfirst into home to be greeted by the batter, a malevolent teammate with a grudge who slugged his face with the bat. Looking for junk story writers trying to be cute or brutally realistic? Fine, this book is for you. Looking for good baseball stories? Look somewhere else."
3,nice,A good read romantic like the fact the women isn't week she's just as strong and love at first sight
1,Disappointed,"I don't like to leave a book unfinished, but sometimes they are just too painful to plod through.The description and plot line of ""Jacob"" sounded great. This book had potential. Unfortunately, the writing is awful. It's trite with string after string of corny metaphors. I stopped reading when just after the book explains that demons are night creatures who can't be in the sun without falling asleep, the author refers to Jacob's (the demon) tan. The dialogue is affected and just not believable. When I start to feel like I'm reading with half my mind on how I would edit a scene (and I'm not an editor), I know it's time to move on. If you haven't checked them out, try Katie MacAlister, J.R. Ward, Kreseley Cole, Sabrina Jeffries, or Gena Showalter for good paranormal romance."
4,Really cool paranormal romance!,"Ms. Frank has started this Nightwalker series with Jacob. I already can't wait for the rest. This book is engrossing, interesting, heart-wrenching, and charming. Her alternate ""species"" The Nightwalkers, are not necessarily anything new but she writes their story with cleverness and appeal. She allows you to understand their world without getting bogged down in metaphysical detail that saps the fun out of a story. You want to like these people, you want to know them....and after some of the scenes, you want to love them! It's pure fantasy with (to quote from the book) ""disgustingly good-looking"" characters, schmaltzy but infinitely likeable (and hot) romance, suspense, and humor. Read this book for fun and escape. You will not be disappointed."
5,An excellent choice!,"This book was an excellent choice for me with my limited German reading skills. I can read the familiar fairy tale in English to help me piece together the meaning of the words I do not know in German. I love that it is full of classic fairly tales. It is not for beginers, but it's still like having ""training wheels"". I am am very pleased with the purchase."
5,Complete Piano Player Omnibus Edition,A first class product delivered very quickly considering the item came from the USA to the UK. I would recommend this product to anyone learning to play the piano and it represents very good value over purchasing each edition seperately.
3,The Master Jesus,"This book was ok but it does not take things like the Dead Sea Scrolls and other recently found secret documents into account. Nor does it take into account the Catholic Churches admitted policy of ""ecclesiastical necessity"" [acceptance of doctrines that will increase the churches size and power, rejection of those that would not]. What Jesus thought was so profoundly simple: ""love thy neighbor; become as a child; do unto others as you would have them do unto you; abandon the vainglorious things of the world; seek the Kingdom of Heaven WITHIN; lift your consciousness to God in prayer and communion."" All of the official decrees added century after century, council after council have eroded the true teachings of Christ. To get back to the basics read 'The Secret Doctrines of Jesus,' by H. Spencer Lewis, find out what the Roman Catholic Church has been hiding all these years. Walking in the footsteps of Jesus will bring us salvation."
4,A tour de force,"This book is a tour de force of early Christian beliefs. J.N.D. Kelly touches every major Father of the Church from the Apostolic Age to the 6th century as well as many relatively minor figures from the early Church. If you want to know what the early Christians believed, I highly recommend this book to you. I caution, though, that in order to get the most out of this book you must have a thorough knowledge of the history of Christianity for the first six centuries at least. This book is already 500 pages long, so there's little time for Kelly to stop along the way to explain historical developments. The book is not even done in chronological order other than perhaps separating the Apostolic Fathers and Apologists from the later Fathers into two different sections of the book; the primary division of the book, though, is thematic. Nonetheless -- read this book if you're interested in knowing what the earliest Christians believed!"
1,chuckleheaded special pleading,"In Schweikart's strange view of American military history, this country never waged a war of aggression---so the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the current debacle in Iraq have to be ignored or, in the last instance, made into a war of self-defense, despite the lack of connections between Saddam and 9/11 and Al Qaida. This book will go down well with those who love OReilly and other purveyors of jingoism."
1,"No good, very disappointing","I got this product based on the 5 star rating (I didn't look far enough to see that it was just 1 person who had rated it!), but this is not a good thermometer at all! My husband and I both tried it over and over on ourselves, and every reading was different, and way, way off. The readings ranged from way under, to slightly under, normal temperature. Very disappointing! Not accurate at all."
2,overrated -- titles are better than the books,"I tried for years to stick up for Acker, but her concepts are always infinitely more interesting than her execution. The truth is she had no natural feel for language -- there's no music to her prose, none at all, and all of the novels sound better when just the titles are read. But the idea of her as the female punk ""underground"" ""subversive"" and ""transgressive"" priestess is very tempting. I say this kind of in sorrow. ""Kathy Goes to Haiti"" is funny once in a while though. This one is a dreary bore."
3,NORMA,"THE ""STAR"" (EDYTA G.) IS GETTING TOO OLD TO PLAY THE YOUNG ROLES. NORMA WOULD BE IDEAL FOR ANNA NETREBKO, WHO COULD BE THE NEXT CALLAS.OVERALL THE MUSIC WAS GREAT."
2,Attractive looking but not very functional,"The product looks really cool, but when it comes down to using it, the suction is not all that great. It wasn't awful, but I had to keep vaccuming the same spot about 10 times before it picked up the hair or other small items. I ended up returning the product."
1,Kone Cordless Hand Vac,"This product is not worth buying I am returning it after using it for the 1st time today. The reason is that the way it is shaped the air blows out of the center of the ""Kone"" shape. Which blow most of what you want to vacuum up away. I bought it for quick cleam up. The first area I tried to use the Kone Vac was around my bird cage. The feathers and seeds blew away when I attempted to vacuum them up. The machine is also very loud. You would think that there was a lot of suction but there is just a lot of noise not a lot of suction. I was so disappointed because it was so compact and looked great. But does not work well at all...That I will return it to get my money back."
2,kone vacuum,"Not sure what to say about this vacuum. It seems to work well enough, but I have a difficult time holding onto it, as there is no handle of any kind. I hadn't thought it would be quite that difficult to hold while vacuuming. I ordered this after reading quite a few good reviews. It seems others did as well, and now there are more negative reviews to read. I wouldn't really recommend this vacuum. There has to be an easier to use vacuum. I actually have an old Royal handheld electric vacuum that works very well. I guess it's not as ""cool"", but it is more effective and much more useful."
5,Does Everything You Buy It For!,"It looks nice -- in a 22nd Century Flash Gordon way-- and it works just fine, picking up the detritus of one's quotidian existence."
2,Two Strikes and you're out,Unit vacuums small dry spills well..this is the second one we purchased to replace a unit whose off/on switch went...now the same problem is happening with this one....never again
2,Football,"This might make it as TV movie but I would not pay for it. I thought is was true life story but it turns out to be a ""what if"" from the life of one of the actors if she had made some different life decisions. Young girls might like this movie for inspiration but in general not a movie I would pay for."
2,Doesn't work that well,I am disappointed to say that this detergent didn't work very well to get my clothes clean. It's also not compatible with high efficiency washers.
1,Pornology: Noun--1: A Good Girl's Guide to Porn; 2: The misadventures of the world's first anthroPORNologist; 3: A Hilarious Exp,"Not real! Supposed to be Non-fiction but included truly impossible situations, basically a book of sex urban legends. Snootie, down talking advice, that in the end didn't seem like advice at all. The smattering of facts in the book were not discussed or explored to determine their meaning or impact. It seemed like the author couldn't go a chapter with out reminding you she went to Harvard and how smart she is, but I am sorry to say it didn't shine through in this book."
5,Daughters and Moms,"My review on the companion book, ""Why a Daughter Needs a Mom"" applies to this one as well.....A book to read over and over, by daughters, Moms, Grandmas, Aunts, etc....and I recommend both of these books be purchased as a set; they make a heart-warming gift for all girls and their parents. My girls gave this one to me for Mother's Day and the other to my Husband for Father's Day......we read a few pages from each book at the end of the day; makes you look forward to the next day....whatever your plans may be! Enjoy!"
5,I love this book!,"This is really an awesome book for any Star Trek fan, going into the uncertain creation and shaky week to week production of the original series. When this was written, no one knew there would be more Star Trek to follow. I remember reading it the first time, wishing the show was still on TV. God Bless Gene Roddenberry!"
2,problems with this antenna and how to fix,i bought this antenna even after reading the bad reviews given to it the same thing happened too me the antenna is crimped on the lower portion of the antenna and not very well at that the thing had a 2 inch wobble at the crimp and stopped all transmitions and reception as it wobbled however i fixed this wobble with a drop of crazy glue at the crimp point my cobra ha ta is now solid as a rock on my midland 75-822 40 channel cb radio i attribute this problem too poor manufacturing wich can be fixed with glue but the manufacturers should take greater pride and ensure owner satisfaction by fixing this problem otherwise this antenna is awsome for a handheld cb works great and after fixing the problem think that this antenna works good and for all you guys out there who dont know what to do about this wobble i hope ive helpped you and for the manufacturer where is the quality control please step it up
2,good seller pore item,it did not work on my hand radio unless it was leaning up on a wall so i contacted the seller and he sent me a new one same problem.
2,cobra ha-ta review,"signal strength was poor. ordered a long range antenna and it improved but not satified. even with the vehicle antenna, reception is poor."
2,Bad crimp...,"I tend to ignore bad reviews - I've found in most cases that the bad experience is because of user error or not reading the description of the item thoroughly before buying. I ignored the bad reviews for this item - How difficult could it be to make an antenna? This item arrived in 2 parts - the BNC base and the telescoping section... this is not how they are supposed to arrive. I tried shoving the two back together but only ended up causing more damage to the telesoping section. I eventually managed to mate the two and wrapped it generously in electrical tape --- sexy. I will say that I noticed an increase in reception right away - but I have a sad, crooked antenna that I doubt will stay together very long. The issue seems to be the terrible crimp job between the two sections - this is something the manufacture needs to resolve... maybe go for a threaded option or something... I dunno. Even if this arrived whole I imagine I would need to treat it carefully to keep from breaking it."
2,Eh...,"I had ordered this product for my handheld CB, it arrived in the time specified in my initial order. The product overall wasn't what I expected. When connected to the handheld, it has a wiggle to it that makes it not-so sturdy. Also, when I had it connected, I had to touch the base of the whip to something that was metal or touch my hand on it to get it to work with anything. Once you pull your hand away, no frequency what so ever. Very disappointed with the result of the product. I'm not sure if I got a dud, or if this is how the actual product works."
2,Stay Away...,"REALM is a band that never got anywhere (in my opinion) because of their vocalist... Wailing never sounds good! These guys sound great on their instruments and the time-changes are amazing. But Mark Antoni's voice simply ruins all efforts... REALM sounds like early FATES WARNING (garbage), TOXIK (also garbage) and KING DIAMOND (sometimes garbage). Wailing means YOU CAN'T SING, short and sweet...Both of REALM's albums have the terrible, high-pitched wailing on all songs, ruining the guitar and drumwork of the other four members. If you like 'Progressive-metal, then give these guys a try. If you like real thrash, stay away..."
1,Short and old,"I was personally hoping to see much more in this book considering the $38+ price for a paperback. It's only 123 pages and the pictures are old and difficult to follow. I've ordered other books for Uechi Ryu and hope to find more helpful content, including detailed information on Kumites."
3,Where's the fact checker when you need him?,"While I understand that the message of Laurie Fox's bittersweet semi-autobiographical novel is more important than the minor details, it is nonetheless maddening that Ms Fox seems to have had no one to set her straight on her story's continuity. Her hapless, and if you would believe her version, hauntingly talented, heroine, wanted to stay home from school on the day the astronauts landed on the moon (an event that took place during the summer vacation for the rest of us). She has Hayley Mills singing ""Let's get together"" (a song from 1960) at the same time the Beatles are popular. Her characters quote the ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" before the film ""Love Story"" could have come out in theaters.While this is a charming, if somewhat self-congratulatory novel, I hope that Ms. Fox decides to employ someone to help her remember dates and times next time she decides to write about something that is supposed to be true."
3,plates,Very fast shipping and got it in excellent condition. The plate looked just like an everyday plate that you can buy anywhere for under five dollars so I was very disappointed. I guess I expected more because it's made by lenox.
4,Needs diffuser for scrunching or styling short hair,"Very powerful- too powerful if you want to scrunch hair for curls or have shorter hair. Needs a diffuser. Otherwise, ok."
5,VERY GOOD,el articulo es muy bueno y ilumina todo el tablero del vehículo. lo recomiendo amplia mente
2,Simple,I am 25 and I use this dvd as a simple easy just relaxing/stretching workout. I have done Insanity and other exercise dvds and this is very simple and easy not challenging at all for someone who is in shape. I think it is good for stretching your back and stuff like that....
2,Not for me...,"I love pilates, but my only real experience with it was the original Winsor Pilates Accelerated Body Sculpt. So when I heard about (and finally tried) the Bender ball I was amazed. The Bender ball can work your abs as well as, or better than (depending on how you use it), the Ab Lounge. However, the look and feel of this Bender Method Pilates DVD left me wishing I would have never wasted my money. The music is awful, the direction is awful, and the workout is pointless. If you're looking for something that will actually challenge you, then this is not the DVD for you."
5,Great item,This works with my Cobra handheld no problem. Makes it easy to take my CB out of my truck. I would recommend this item.
4,Un exemple fantastique!,"This is what opera on DVD should be: A beautifully sung and lovingly directed production, splendidly packaged (with a bonus DVD yet)...and at a very affordable price.I too have reservations about Emilio Sagi's updating, only in that it makes no sense whatsoever in regards to the actual libretto. (Admittedly not an insignificant problem.) If Marie has been raised by the American army, why on Earth is she saluting the French when the regiment comes to her rescue in Act 2? And at what time during WWII were the Americans and French ""enemies?"" Pure nonsense. But when one can revel in the sublime voices of Juan Diego Florez and Patrizia Ciofi (who I found to be surprisingly comfortable with the comedy), why quibble? Everyone on stage, in the audience and in the pit is having a marvelous time, and I defy anyone watching at home not to have one as well."
2,Not impressed,"I was dissappointed in the book, I already know some basic Yoga and was looking for something geared specifically towards the golfer. Instead the book took regular yoga poses, which you learn in any basic yoga class, and applied them to golf.Now there is nothing inherently wrong with that - its just that I expected something really focused on golfers - maybe my expectations were too high?I would recommend this book to people who have no concept of Yoga and need some flexibility and general physical conditioning improvement.However if you are an active person and have the possibility of attending Yoga classes then do that instead. You will learn everything this book has in the first class ..."
5,Worth Owning,"I just adore Sukisho. After I watched it, I watched it for the second time in my life, and enjoyed it even more than when I watched it the first time. It's sad that it ended, but at least it concluded the anime. The only thing that disappoints me is that I didn't get so see as much YoruXRan yaoi as I would have liked. I'm so glad I bought this. I have no regrets whatsoever."
4,Adorably cute,"This DVD had it all---romance, drama, slapstick moments that had me holding me stomach from the laughter, and a good dose of mystery.Sunao and Sora were adorable, as was their relationship, and I found myself cheering them on despite the obstacles in their path (namely Sora's obliviousness and Sunao's many secrets), and celebrating when in the end love triumphed and saved the day.I recommend it to all who like a good laugh with their anime (but who can also appreciate the appropriate dark moments as well)."
2,kinda stupid.........,"Don't get me wrong. I like anime. Some of it is very good, some of it is very funny. This had the potential to go either way but did neither. By the end of it I was just thankful it was over and didn't care. I'm not sure why everyone else likes it so much. Maybe I'm missing something that everyone else sees, but I hate that I wasted time and money on it when there were others I would have rather watched."
1,DOES NOT FIT 2005 Dodge Magnum,2nd blade I bought from Amazon that was suppose to fit my 2005 Dodge Magnum. Well it DOES NOT FIT. I put in the make and model of my car on Amazon and it comes up as fitting. I cut it apart and made it work. I think the only blade that will fit the rear wiper on the Magnum is the one from Dodge.
2,The Best of the Best Tae Kwon Do- Kukkiwon & TIgers Demo Tms,"... Not the best quality filming... Nicely packaged in an attractively made VHS wrapper, but that is the only thing of real quality with this tape.The ""Best of the Best"" tape needs to work on quality of tape transfer and the video, itself, is a reproduction of (what appears to be) amateur videography spliced together with annoying music and viewing. Poor transfer quality or crummy camera used to shoot this?Though, I must admit, to see the Korean Tigers in action is truly amazing, and SO rare to find! So, I guess if you really cannot find a tape and you REALLY want a Tiger tape, like we did, then this might be your only available option.Let's face it, the Tigers rock the Tae Kwon Do World!!"
4,I'm Purrrfect!,"This is probably the most durable DBZ figure I have. He's sturdy, heavy, and virtually unbreakable. His wings and stinger are removable and don't really like to stay attached to Cell's body. He isn't really articulate either. His arms and legs move, but very minimally. He's great to give to a kid, but the small stinger might be a problem for a small child. I wouldn't give this to any younger kid unless you kept the stinger out of harm's way. That all being said, Cell is a fun, neat little addition to the DBZ collection, but for the true collector, there are definitely better figures out there."
5,The best book ever!,"It was super book that i just could NOT put down. Great for all Lucy fans young and old. Recounts her life correctly just as she saw it. Be prepared to stay up all night reading it, though."
5,"Warm, clear and evocative this book is a must for Lucy Fans!","This book is every thing any Lucy Fan could want!!! Never before has a book been written in her own words. It was enjoyable as well as sad and brought forth the emotion in a clear way that was really Lucy. I Love Lucy is the Best show ever created for television and Lucille Ball is the Best Actress. I learned things about her show I never knew and things about her. From the Whirlwind Romance to the Hardest Times, this book is top notch reading for anyone who ""Love's Lucy""!!!!"
3,"It was just like the book,the talking eggs","It was just like the book the talking eggs. But I liked it. I liked the part when Myrtle plays the trick on the Prince Harold. I didn't like the way the people took advantage of rosella. she should have taken all her jewels back from prince Harold and given all the jewels to the poor people like she wanted instead of having the palace built. She should have taken charge of the situation! Inspite of how similar the story was to the talking eggs, I found it a fun, enjoyable read. Also, like in the book Ella Enchanted I felt empathy for the main character Rosella or Ella. With Ella you felt sorry for her how she always had to tell the truth, and with Rosella how people were using her for her jewels that came out of her mouth."
4,The Fairy's Mistake,"Fairys, elves, dragons, magical castles. If you like any of these you will love this great book. The Fairy's Mistake is a great adventure book for children. The story is full of twists and excitement. The Fairy's Mistake takes place in an imaginary place called Snettering-on-Snakes where a young girl named Rossela is given a gift by a fairy for her kindness. The fairy's gift does not seem so great after awhile. To find out how Rossela deals with her problem, read this wonderful book."
5,Everything a documentary should be!,"An excellent documentary! Well organized, compelling story, interesting research and facts, and great characters! Really makes you think about not only the issues facing the electric cars owners but takes you all the way to the big picture, politics and the environment. Really really well done! I loved it so much I bought it."
5,Excellent Documentary,"This is a very interesting and informative documentary, and it also made me VERY angry that these wonderful little cars are no longer available. We need to get them back!"
4,Does for cars what Blue Gold does for water!,"I really loved the murder-mystery foundation of this film. It reminded me fondly of The Corporation and it's sociopath analysis of corporations as a person. But what I really loved about this film is the natural pacing and visual build of its message. It reminds me of one of my other favorite political films, Blue Gold World Water Wars, which also builds with a visual language of its own to a horrifying emotional end. See this film!"
4,I'll have an electric car one day,"OK, what GM has done to the elctric car is soooooo stupid it hurts....If i'll have the money i'll buy an electric car tomorrow....Help save the earth, and watch this documentary, it's really well done."
4,Eye-opening video!,"This eye-opening video shows that electric cars ARE practical and DID happen about a decade ago. So why not now? I know, it's because of those darned BATTERIES! Even now, this video shows that the current news stories we were fed earlier this month (July, 2007) by even some of the environmental press that Toyota and GM hope to have electric cars with a range of 40 miles available by 2010 are stalling tactics. In 1999, GM released the last EV1 vehicles (basically electric Saturns) with batteries to allow a range of A HUNDRED AND 40 miles before needing to recharge, and then later scrapped or disabled every one of the cars! Why are we going backward from what has already been done? (Incidentally, a great follow-up to this video is the book Plug-in Hybrids, by Sherry Boschert (New Society Publishers, 2006).)"
4,GM couldn't have picked a worse time,"If you are sincerely interested in our planet's wellbeing and that of our country, this movie gives you pause for thought. In a time when global warming is seemingly overtaking us, and middle eastern oil producing countries are attempting to exploit us while they hate, this movie reminds us of how far from common sense we have come. Big business' like GM have lost their way and fail to appreciate the needs of the society within which they exist. Watch the movie and think about that!"
4,Green Food for Thought...,"Impressive documentary, although my own personal prejudices and thick-skinned cynicism lead me to worry a little about all that is presented here as fact. No matter what, however, the film stimulates a vital and timely debate."
5,Should be required in school,"If you always thought capitalism was the answer for the world's problems, watch this movie. It's devastating, and proves that big business controls what Americans will buy whether or not it's what they want. And big business wants to sell you things they can continue to make more money from in perpetuity. I wish I could show this movie to everyone I know and all their friends.If you like this one: try The Future of Food. Another unbelievable true story."
2,"The book plus cassette seems a good idea, but is too hard.","I'm trying to learn Vietnamese and have made several attempts to use this book plus the cassette. I usually learn languages rapidly, and I'm also an ESOL teacher. I would expect a Vietnamese speaker to be able to have a simple conversation after an 18-week course. Unfortunately, this book expects an English speaker to do this in Vietnamese after two lessons!Vietnamese is very different from English, so a slow approach is needed with plenty of repetition and simple exercises.The book and cassette are well produced, but they do not show an understanding of how languages are learnt."
2,too difficult to hear pronunciations,"I have bought this book with 2 CDs and I found that this book is good if you have good ears. The people on the CDs speak too fast and it is very difficult to be able to repeat the correct pronunciations. Although it is a good book if you have more than enough time and more than enough patience to learn Vietnamese when using this book, it's not a very practical book if you want to learn just the basics when having a conversation when speaking witha Vietnamese speaker. I don't suggest buying this unless you are absolutely stranded and do not have a choice of selection."
1,Not worth the money,Pictures taken in average light and inside are very poor. May be ok for outside pictures. Software and ease of use are good. You have to remove the screen cover to properly use it.
1,"Love Olivia, hate the opening commercials","We bought this to keep our toddler occupied on a long plane trip, and we love the TV show. However, I am disappointed at the amount of commercials at the beginning of the disk. Toddlers are not known for their patience, and a fussy toddler waiting for her show defeats the entire purpose of having this as a distraction."
5,A really good quality show!,"I received this as a gift for my 3 year old, and she adores it. We have been fans of the book for about 6 months, and also of the audio books (featuring Dame Edna) and so this is a fun addition to the character that she has grown to love, with new story lines and good lessons (about sharing, teamwork, taking others' feelings into account) and it's just plain clever. I highly recommend it as the episodes are short but have a really good beginning, middle and end - well written and with interesting animation (so expressive).I bet Ian Falconer approved these, and he's the brainchild of it all."
4,"Great for ""networking beginners""","This material is very valuable for someone who is just learning about how to network-- especially for young adults, new college graduates, etc. We use this material as a standard part of a curriculum on networking we do for college women. It's true that we don't use or recommend his exact tools but a large part of learning about how to network is adopting the mentality of recognizing the opportunities, and of recognizing reciprocity. I think his material is inspiring and fun to listen to, and I highly recommend it for ""beginners"". His examples of networking success and networking blunders are eye opening. I like this material, and I recommend it!"
5,Ethics,"My purchase of Enforcings Ethics couldn't have been better. It was brand NEW!!! I didn't know what to expect, I was surprised."
1,EA-BLO6 NOT for Minolta Dimage Xi,"Since this rechargable battery was clearly listed under ""accessories"" on the Minolta Dimage Xi Amazon WEB page, I purchased one to serve as a backup. It was delivered well before I received the camera. Imagine my surprise when I finally received the Dimage Xi and opened up the Sharp battery package to find that the battery was too wide to fit in the camera or the battery charger which came with the camera! This battery is NOT an accessory that fits with the Dimage Xi. I have sent it back."
2,Good only for one year,"Apple MacBook Pro MA896LL/A 15"" Notebook PC (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive)So I got my Macbook Pro on May 16, 2006 - I remember it so well because I got it as a birthday present from my parents. Its great, nice GUI (VERY user friendly, take it from someone who's used Windows all 17 years of her life and only just switched to Mac). However, I'd always notice that the macbook was REALLY hot - and so was the power adapter. Although it was extremely powerful and never really crashed on me, turns out, this came at the cost of the adapter. After one year of continuous use, the cord of the adapter (not the removable part, the part that connects the macbook to the actual item) melts on you. It would be fine if it was an isolated case, but it seems as if a lot of users have been having the same problem (check out the macbook forums). So keep in mind that after a year, your laptop will stop being useful until you get a new adapter."
5,Compact Great Radio,"I got this to replace an older, larger radio. So far, so good. I'll give it a good test this June during our annual trek to Abaco, Bahamas. Over there, marine radios are used as telephones since there are so many islands you hop to and from in your rental boat. I use it for hailing cabs, making dinner reservations, checking on marinas and anything else where you would normally use a telephone."
5,A Nice Surprise,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book but it was recommended to me by a friend so I ordered it. When I got it, my first thought was""Wow. Short book is right."" But don't let its length fool you. It is for people new to options and it's a very condensed volume of information that focuses on covered calls and touches on a few variations of them. It starts out with an overview of options and gives good easy to understand examples. It then moves into buying and selling options and finally focuses on covered call writing. It gives very good examples of various trades and the affects of yields and volatility.You can use this book to get started on covered call writing with good confidence. I really liked this book a lot because it was very focused on teaching one very effective and conservative options strategy instead of trying to teach several confusing strategies all at once."
5,One of the best series I've read!,"The writing in this series is phenomenal! It is obvious that extensive research was done to make these books so real and vivid ... to the point that one forgets who is a creation of the author and who isn't! Definitely on my ""must read"" recommendation list!"
1,Disappointed,"I would probably like the game if I could get my 'family' set up properly. I have given up for the time being, but will try another time."
1,Did not work in my car very well,"I tried in in the best of conditions, with me pulled over and in a good reception area and it cut off half of the incoming conversation. If you want hands-free, plug in a handset or buy a bluetooth phone and get either a bluetooth headset of a blueant speakerphone."
3,What does this do?,I bought something similar to this NOT THIS ITEM with a cable modem in 2007. I have no idea what's it is suppossed to do.
5,57 Channels Joning LEAF to RCA - Fairfield CA,"Just got this today, connected both antennas to combiner, connected combiner to amp, rescanned and now I'm getting 57 channels which is 9 more then I was getting with the LEAF alone. Channels 2 - 10 were the ones I didn't get with the LEAF and my guess was a dipole would be the best supplement for the LEAF and in my case IT IS! The RCA pulls 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 but only with the amp in place. Here is my amp2-Port Bi-Directional Cable TV HDTV Amplifier Splitter Signal Booster with Passive Return Path. My TV is this LG which is a newer modelLG Infinia 42LV5400 42-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV. I'm in a valley with hills all around and my house is over 30 miles away from all of the stations, so this setup is amazing and blows away the idea that you need a big rooftop antenna to receive a lot of channels."
5,Great explanation of political ecology,"As a professional in the environmental area in Central America, I applaud Vandermeer and Perfecto's explanations of the workings of man in the humid tropical forests of our region. These are not easy issues, yet they manage to leave the reader with a sense of the urgency without oversimplifying or becoming preachy. This book is best for someone who is really interested in the political ramifications of US policy in the tropics, or for someone interested in working in the environment overseas."
3,Some good parts but dated,"William Greider is a good writer and this was an excellent read- in 1992. Many of the complaints he has- such as a regressive tax code- are less applicable after the Clinton years. I just couldn't get into the S&L; scandals anymore. Old news.This is not to say there is nothing of value in the book. Greider does talk eloquently of the corruption of the political process by big money. I think the best part of the book is ""Rancid Populism,"" a chapter on the Republicans' constant betrayal of the middle class and poor at the hands of the wealthy.Perhaps this book needed an updated edition for the 21st century. Much of it seemed irrelevant today. Who cares whether Henry Gonzales (former Congressman) does on his Saturday nights?"
5,Brilliant!,"A must-read for students of government. This information is needed in classrooms from the third grade on up, even though translated into simpler terms for the younger. Greider reveals the Achilles heel of democracy that also must be taught if we are to preserve the system - if money hasn't already overwhelmed it."
5,Great buy!,Love this. Sound is true. I had to buy rechargeable batteries because I use this so much. I do not regret this purchase. I also purchased the Citizen's tape player which is just as good. Citizen has come a long way!!
4,Mind You Not Easy To Find,was very pleased to see amazon had this it is not easy to find and i was very pleased w/iteam when i got it.....
3,There's nothing like the original.,"I am entertained much like anyone else who remembers growing up with these tunes drumming around in their head, but I miss all of the nuances absent such as in my personal favorite, ""The Motorcycle Song."" Great material as it was, including the keyboards . Please re-master the old reels to CD."
5,Forever Arlo,"How can you get through a Thanksgiving without turkey and ""Alice's Restaurant""?You can get all those great memories at Alice's."
4,Cobra CB Mic.,"We thought the mic. was the problem with the CB we had and ordered this. It came promptly, and seems fine, but the CB still doesn't work, so it's probably no faulut of this product, but our CB (hopefully)! Anyway, the shipment was quick and the product seems great. Thanks!"
3,"OK mic, But mic-Hanger button broke off.","My Brother bought one for me and it was a okay performer, but the hanger Button broke off and this is not an easy fix. Its molded into the back of the mic, no fasteners. A replacement button is available but almost imposable to replace. Be for warned."
4,unexpected,We didn't watch this until 2007. I guess the title threw us off. So much about Roswell and it didn't get our interest. It is a series that deserves to be known. We found new stars and some good acting. It had a fresh appeal with the story line for SciFi fans. You should give it a try.
4,"Cheap, Easy, Effective & Eat your Eggs","I use this product. It helps, but not as much as spinach, kale, or Swiss chard. Eggs contain highly bio-available Lutein and Zeaxanthin, and DO NOT raise serum cholesterol. This in addition to being the best RX for distressed hair, and the very highest quality of naturally occurring protein. Noting wrong with pills, but in most cases they're making up for poor diet.[...]...or GoogleConsumption of One Egg Per Day Increases Serum Lutein and Zeaxanthin Concentrations in Older Adults without Altering Serum Lipid and Lipoprotein Cholesterol Concentrations.From Journal of Nutrition.Information the hyperglycemic-pushing cereal companies don't want you to know."
1,ONLY 2 MG OF LUTEIN!!!,"There's only 2 mg of lutein/Zeaxanthin in each tablet! The rest is typical stuff found in your everyday vitamin pills like Vitamin A,C,E, calcium, etc. I'm upset that the seller did not disclose the supplement facts. I wonder why there are so many good reviews! I can get 20mg of lutein for the same price on Amazon. I'm returning these."
2,A Definitely Minor Writer,"In this edition, the novel itself takes up only 143 pages. The rest is apparatus, excerpts of discarded text, and a lot of other editorial mumbo-jumbo. However, there is one big thing missing from this edition, and that is T. S. Eliot's preface. I have read only the first chapter, but I don't think I'm going to appreciate the remaining chapters either.I managed to plow my way through this truly awful book, but I couldn't make myself read more than a chapter a day. It was just pointless. There was no story, none of the characters were even remotely interesting, nor did they have anything memorable to say.There are certain books I have just not been able to appreciate: IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT, A TRAVELER (Calvino), THE MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES (Musil), all of Rabelais. It's probably a missing gene, one I'm glad I haven't got."
5,Vachss rocks!!,"This is dark stuff bigtime, but so well done and entertaining. Plus, you learn a lot about some unfortunate things that happen throughout our society."
3,Travis McGee as Blowhard,"In this outing, McGee holds forth on everything from relationships to politics to society at large ad nauseum. Nothing is too small to escape MacDonald's pressing urge to tell us ""how it is."" There are small asides of this type in the other books which are easily forgiven, but A Deadly Shade of Gold is a bit like being stuck, repeatedly, on a char lift with a blowhard between brief runs down the mountain."
4,"Good, not great.","This book is a fine action-adventure novel, and if that's all you're looking for, it will fit the bill nicely. But as a Travis McGee novel, it's a bit weak; McGee's motivations are a little murkier in this novel than in most of the other 20 Travis McGee novels, and a reader who'd read this one without reading the others wouldn't have nearly as solid a feel for the fact that McGee is one of the GOOD guys, rather than just a bloody mercenary willing to to almost anything for the money as they should. Granted, there are evidences in this book to moderate that judgement, but not nearly as many as can be found in most of the McGee novels, and the impression isn't moderated nearly as well as I'd like; the character isn't nearly as likeable in this book as in most others. And considering that what sets this series apart from any other action-adventure novel is the character of McGee, that's a serious drawback."
3,Just ok,"This is my first Cathe workout and it was fun, with moves Ive never done before but it didnt get my heart rate up that high. Im excited to try more of Cathe's workouts, it sounds like they are much better then this one was. Turbo Jam was a lot more intense then this one and is a good alternative for those who are looking for high heart rates"
3,"Works great, until you get LCD TV","Had these up and running in multiple rooms in our house - easy to setup and works great.HOWEVER we have been banging our heads against the walls recently because our remotes to our Tivo have been working only intermittently - long pauses and not working smoothly.After some troubleshooting i have discovered that if you have these near (our) LCD Tv, they work sporadically.I know this is a known issue, but we bought ours several years ago before we had any LCD widescreen TVs. At this point we're having to replace them all with LCD ""resistant"" units.Otherwise they have been great, but at this point they are worthless to us."
3,"Good jacket, but ""noisy""!","I was looking for a suitable replacement for my Duluth Grab Jacket (Version 1.0) that was stolen. This jacket was close for fit and looks, but the Teklon nylon is just too ""noisy""; every move you make involving the jacket touching itself reminds me of rustling paper. If you can look past this (I couldn't, so it's going back), I think you'll be happy with this outerwear as a ""3-season"" jacket: comfortable over a dress shirt for fall/spring or layered with a sweater for winter.(My next try is a Taslan nylon jacket, which is supposed to have a softer, more supple feel.)"
3,Pretty Good Gun,"This gun is pretty cool, it's bigger than you think it is, and it really does have nice weight to it thanks to the metal clip, it seems pretty reliable and will work, just dont drop it. It's also very cool looking, this would make a great stocking stuffer. I just opened it for Christmas and have been playng with it all day. The only problem is that the accuracy is pretty bad, when you shoot it goes to the left and or right, and it's not that powerful but hey for 6 bucks its great fun. Set up some beer cans and shoot em."
2,Nice but did not fit :(,Nice case BUT too small for my Lumix camera :( Not worth to return it so I'll just keep it or give it away.
4,Too big for Canon SD1000,For a Canon SD1000 it is big. I would thing of something smaller that would fit anywhere. CaseLogic has some interesting options or the rezo models from Lowepro.
2,The fit's too snug,"We bought this camera case to hold our new Panasonic DMC-25FH. We realize it's a compact case for a compact camera. However, it's difficult to zip up after inserting the camera because it's a little too snug."
3,Does not fit Canon PowerShot!,"Even though the description specifically says it will fit the Canon PowerShot cameras, it doesn't. I purchased for my Canon PowerShot A570 IS and this bag is too small. If I spend five minutes jamming it in I can barely close the zipper. One plus, this camera bag comes with a shoulder strap. Most do not."
4,Clarification of Ms. Kishline's story at time of accident,"Audrey Kishline did indeed follow her own advice. She realized some time before the accident that after successfully moderating her own drinking, she was NO LONGER able to moderate. Possibly, that was due to some very real and significant life changes she was experiencing at the time, but that's just my speculation. She advised the MM group of her decision. Then she joined AA. Let me repeat that: Audrey Kishline was in AA at the time of her drunk driving accident. Audrey Kishline had decided that MM did not work for her at the time of her accident.Just wanted to make that clear.MM is hard work, but it does work for some people."
1,Moderation is trouble for alcoholics,"Readers should know that this author wasn't herself successful at moderation. She killed a parent and child while driving drunk and is now in prison. If someone has a problem with alcohol, but isn't alcoholic, they will have no problem changing their drinking habits on their own. People who can't do this on their own are alcoholic, and they can't drink moderately. The greatest success for the greatest number of people is still AA. AA is something the author wanted to avoid but, unfortunately, her ""better idea"" led her to tragedy and prison."
4,CB used in a rock quarry,"Good CB mic for the price. Purchased to use in a loader in a rock quarry, so the noise cancelling is a good feature. I can hear and understand the loader operator when he calls."
4,Unsure,"I bought this after looking at the options and prices. I just wanted a new Mic for my CB. This one seemed to fit the bill, and seems to work well. I do have an issue though. If I touch the mic cable I get a bunch of static even if my squelch is maxed out. This is very annoying, but may not be related to the mic at all. Still looking into the issue.Otherwise the mic has been great. It is a little on the cheap side, but looks and performs nice."
4,Good Collection of Portrait Paintings,I bought this book for inspiration and ideas. It has a wide variety of portraits in various mediums. I felt it was a good art investment.
1,Totally Confusing,"By the time I finished this book I couldn't figure out whether Graysmith believed Reverend Gibson or William Randolf Hearst was Jack the Ripper. He simultaneously showed the newspaper accounts of the day to be, at best, heavily predjudiced accounts of the crimes, and then depended on them for his research. His reconstructed diary of Theo Durrant was the last straw--it was written by a character he had invented! I'm going to avoid Graysmith from now on."
4,Very Entertaining,My nine month old loves this toy. He likes to roll the balls and also watch the objects inside move around. This definately occupies his time and would recommend the Roll a Rounds Dinosaur as well.
1,Whatch out for the power supply,"I was trying to share a satellite box between two rooms with this unit and a 2010, and by trying to save some money I did not buy the power adapter required, planning to use one that I had. Well, did not work, my adapter did not work with the 2010. The 2010 was faulty also, and I could not get a warranty exchange since Amazon is not an authorized dsitributors for this product. I had to purchase another unit plus the power supply, now the savings that I was expecting by not paying my satellite provider for an extra box are going to take double the time (almost 2 years) to recup."
2,Brilliant Authors -,"The text is either a great text with horrible supporting documentation, including the practice quizzes, or wonderfully written practice quizzes and a horribly written text. And I am very sad to add, the quizzes the Authors (or is it the Publisher's handiwork?) market to the Instructors are equally ill-conceived. If it is the intention of the Authors to write material and provide learning materials such that the quizzes are a reasonable measure of that learning they pitifully miss the mark. If the quizzes are merely to identify how poor the Authors did with the textbook, then they are excellent quizzes. The concepts are difficult enough, but when the Authors go out of their way to convolute the verbiage in either their text or online additional materials this is academic elitism. This is not a text I would select."
4,Good book.,"The book was really great in describing and explaining what tools you will need to conduct research. The only downside to this book is that it is pretty dry, but I needed it for a course so I couldn't complain."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"The sofware that accompanies this textbook is bad. If you have a Mac, IBM want's you to purchase further software for $40 for SPSS to work on Mac's. If you have a PC, you have to jump through the hoops of deleting a windows update and one of the file's on the disk being corrupt. Amazon customer service was of no help either. DO NOT BUY THIS TEXTBOOK IF YOU NEED SPSS!"
3,The Black Marble by Joseph Wambach,I found this book [ the 1st that I have read by this author] very confusing - such that I did not finish reading it.
3,Only 3 stars because I haven't started the training yet,I only gave this 3 stars because I actually haven't started training yet. I have only read through the book. There is a lot of good info in the book and I am interested to see if I can indeed run a 4 hour marathon. The book definitely makes you feel like you can do it. One thing that is really eye opening is the pace you need to maintain to run a 4 hour marathon. I am definitely going to have to work on speed before I start this program.
3,4 hours? Not quite...,"While I found the book to have lots of helpful tips and my time improved (though not under four hours), I do not recommend this book to this first time marathoner. I felt the suggestions on speed work and endurance overall to be helpful. However, I felt this program can lead to overtraining, especially with several runs of 20+ miles. I would like to see a program which combines Dave Kuehls and Bob Glover's programs."
4,Great Reference,"If you are a novice runner and need to know the basics, this book is for you. Great advice on what to wear for certain weather conditions, where to train, a great schedule. Gives you encouragement to reach your goal: a marathon."
4,Old Hippy Still Sounds Good,"Recently I attended an Arlo & Sarah Lee Guthrie concert. Many of the songs were from 'The Mystic Journey'. The stories surrounding such songs as 'Wake Up Dead' & 'Doors To Heaven' were at once funny and touching. Being a Viet Nam vet the song 'When A Soldier Comes Home'reminded me of the bittersweet memory of returning from an unpopular war. The title cut and 'Moon Song' were also strong songs, in fact I liked the entire CD. As my wife said, ""Arlo sounds like Bob Dylan in tune""."
5,ARLO!!!!,"I never thought it would happen but with, ""When a Soldier Makes it Home"" Arlo has finally equaled, if not beaten, Bob Dylan's writing prowess."
5,Boys NIV Bible,This is a GREAT Bible translation and this item is also a great cost for a gift bible for boys.
3,Good game. Instructions lost in translation.,"We got it for my 3 1/2 daughter for Christmas. She likes to play with it every few day or so. The game has instructions in multiple languages. The English version did not make much sense in a couple if places. So we made up our own rules. Fun, nonetheless."
3,Beautifully photographed survey of Egyptian monuments.,"A beautifully photographed art book showing the monumental architecture of ancient Egypt. Line drawing diagrams, of horizontal and vertical planes, give a good perspective of building styles. Do not expect to find translations of the heiroglyphic inscriptions, military, political or historical narratives. This book is strictly for those interested in the stones and building techniques and changes in architectural styles from Prehistory to the Romans. With only 229 pages of text, mostly illustration, the serious student of Ancient Egypt will appreciate this in the National Geographic style of reading. For those seeking a survey of Egyptian style, it will make a fine addition to your coffee table for a season. Best wishes, John Piscopo"
5,The bard of the oblivious male,"The people and situations in Russell Banks's short stories, here collected from those written throughout his 37 years of writing, generally have two things in common: stark lives, and oblivious people. Yet somehow he manages to make us care about them, probably because they ring so true. His writing is poetic in a way that doesn't call attention to itself. He is one of our unknown masters who, like Carver, Ondaatje, Woiwode, most often tells us stories centered on reluctantly-civilized males mildly bewildered by their lives.Not an easy writer. But a very good one."
4,Thought Provoking,"This is more ""academic"" than I expected it to be, but very thought provoking. The insights into the minds of those who lived in a world before knowledge was written has helped me to be more aware of how modern people interact with and interprete information."
5,A beautifully designed collection of distinctive houses.,I wouldn't change a thing. Very well designed.
5,Swiss Diamond Fry Pan,The order came quickly and I just love this pan. I have been looking for years for a pan that is non stick that my teenagers or visitors could not wreak with knives. This is that pan! I will order more in the future of this product.
5,Now I'm a better cook!,I like this pan. It cooks very evenly once it heats. A whole pound of bacon comes out of the pan at the same time. Cleans up nicely also.
2,A Mixed Bag,"Sometimes customer reviews can steer you wrong. I relied on a review below praising this pan's handle and have found it to be far less solid than implied. This is a heavy pan and, when filled with food, a lot of torque is exerted on the handle. I have had to retighten mine several times in the first year of service and find that it never feels 100% secure. It's less of a problem with the smaller fry pans from Swiss Diamond, but all in all I don't think I would choose a non-riveted pan again and especially not at the premium price of this one!"
1,This pan contains teflon!,[...].I went looking for Green pans and this is one of the ones that's falsely advertised. It contains the chemical which is teflon (apparently they can make them with the chemical but can't say teflon since that name is copywrited). If you are buying a true green pan - avoid this one as it is not environmentally safe. I found this reviewer who spent some major time trying to learn what the chemicals were in this pan and he finally got back a letter from the company stating it has the chemicals we consider to be teflon.
2,Doesn't last a lifetime,I bought this pan a few years back at a considerably lower price. It was great for about a year then it started flaking and is really no longer nonstick. If the pan were around $20.00 I would get another but for the short time that it last it is not worth this extremely high price.
5,good stuff,"I love this speaker.. cant say enough about it.. very clear both in the lot, and on the road with windows down.. very pleased.. very good buy.. i have suggested it to friends..good job cobra. bought a new cobra 29 lx le very nice radio not peaked or tuned and its nice for being only 4 watts.. only complaint is that the mic sucks.. feels cheap and large..had to switch out with astatic..naptown"
4,Very helpful,This book has been very helpful in my workplace since I've never used Active Directory in my previous jobs. Keep up the good work!
5,"***CAUTION*** Scripts contain hot code, handle with care!","Robbie,Excellent book and site for us AD guru's. The cookook hassaved me from writing a bunch of scripts. Thanks!Regards,David ChianeseIT - Server ServicesDelaware Investments / Lincoln Financial Group"
5,Worth twice the price,"All I can say is WOW. A friend recommended this book to me, but I was a little skeptical because I didn't think I needed another AD book. I was intrigued though because I'm a big fan of the O'Reilly Cookbook format. Well I wasn't disappointed. This book has to be the most useful and practical AD book available. It is a how-to guide that not only covers the basic admin tools, but also shows how to accomplish each task with a script too! This one is going right by my monitor.I don't see how any admin regardless of experience level wouldn't be able to get their money's worth (and then some) out of this book. Keep 'um coming O'Reilly!"
1,Plastic piece to secure the phone in place broke after 2 weeks!,"This frikkin thing is inferior to the one that came with the phone when I bought it! I was listening to music in the office and i turned in my chair, the cord caught on the arm of the chair and it popped out. Now with the original piece it would not have broken. But this newer cord broke in 2 weeks flat!!"
3,Same as stock quality,"Sound quality is not bad, as a stock earbud. But you get what you paid for. Not better than my 30 bucks yamaha."
2,Good but didn't last,"I too had these earbuds for a short time (approx. ~ 2 months) before the left earbud came apart and they shorted out. After that if I used them it would be broken noise out of one or both ears.For the short time the earbuds worked, they sounded great, better sound and more comfortable than the original iPod earbuds.The case is a simple piece of plastic. It serves its purpose and is inexpensive. Yeah it's not the best, but what can you really ask for for this price?That being said... I did not usually store mine in the case, as I often wrapped the chord around my iPod. This MIGHT have stretched the wires at the jack and earbud connections and contributed to the short in the wires, therefore I would suggest using the case to store when not listening.I will be looking for something a little sturdier next and will perhaps be a little more careful with their storage. If you are active or store your buds the way I do, perhaps you should look for something else too."
2,Mediocre.,"Compared to earphones at similar prices, the sound quality of the Phillips 2650 is not impressive.At first listen, it was significantly worse than the Sony 818 earbuds. I believe it gets better after several hours but still worse than the Sony earbuds. By worse I mean lack of clarity, an unclear muffle as if someone is talking with a cup taped over their mouth.Build quality is poor. Falls apart easily. The earbud shells fall apart. The silicone lining falls off with this brown goo. The spear screen falls off. They do not last.These are a step up from the dollar store trash, but I don't recommend these when there are plenty better for the same price."
1,Uncomfortable,"These headphones are terribly uncomfortable. They are too big to stay in my ears and completely unusable to me. They don't sound very good, either. I had to give them away."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this,"If the main character walked throughout the house one more time I was ready to break the DVD.The acting is not terrible, but...There is no sex, no nudity, just posing and more posing and even more posing.There is no real story. No purpose. Just a huge waste of money and time."
2,Meh.,"While the guitar is okay, it has quite a few errors.The amp just sucks. It's noisy and basic.There is a huge amount of fret buzz.The amp overall gives it a thin, papery sound. I upgraded to a decent fender amp and it sounds much better.The frets cut my fingers when I do slides. Which is bad, because in my band (we play death metal) I use alot of slides."
1,Didn't like,"This was not a practical tool for use by a non-Chinese speaker. I was hoping for more insight into the culture of Chinese food and Chinese character/English language translations that might be easy to use. Definitely not the case. Maybe if you are a Chinese chef or English speaking food technician, this might have some use. I had great hopes, alas."
1,would not have liked it at half the price,"I've had many in the last 30 or more years... I expected something good, This is not. Poor sound quality said everyone every time I keyed the mike"
1,Spank The Plank,"The author in the book sacrifices the importance of the emotional and spiritual ties that bonded the shipmates to a overemphasis of the relatively unimportant but intimate physical bond the men shared. For example, the common practice of ""walking the plank"" must be understood within its historical context as symbolizing the buccaneering version of a fashion show affording seaworthy suitors ample opportunity to size up potential bedworthy mates. I was saddened of the lack of illustrative material that should have accompanied the more explicit descriptions of homoerotic parlances. To his credit, the author has ""laid"" the groundwork for further inquiry to this fascinating subject."
1,"Sucked, plain and simple","This is one of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. I read about 3 chapters before deciding that it wasn't going to get any better. Jen tries way too hard to be funny but comes off like one of those people that other people try to avoid because they think they are so cute and funny but they aren't. Her ""all about me"" shtick gets old real fast. She's like, ""Here comes Jen I'm so f'ing funny, haha see how funny I am!!!!"" Its that obnoxious. And I stupidly bought TWO of her books together. They both suck. If you are in to subtle, dry wit steer clear of this."
1,Ditto all the other 1-star reviews,"I only read this book because a friend loaned it to me and I needed something to do during downtime at work. I only finished it because I knew Jen was going to get her comeuppance and I wanted to revel in it. The book was amusing due to the horrible and embarrassing situations she created for herself. But her monologue was not funny; it was mean and b**chy. In order for me to really like a book I have to be able to relate and sympathize with the characters. I could do neither. The only reward was in reading about her getting what she deserved. I'm a plus-sized woman myself, but her humiliation at the marathon check-in had me chortling with glee."
4,Read ths book if you like to laugh,"This book is great. Read IT! It is funny, well written, and just a ton of fun."
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"This book was hilarious from cover to cover. Jen Lancaster, while somewhat obnoxious, is a very endearing character. In the beginning you'll root for her downfall but by the end you'll be rooting for her success. If you're looking for a light read to take to the beach this summer, you've found it."
4,Great story,I just finished this book and I couldn't put it down until I was done. Anyone who's been job searching can totally relate. I was laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. The author is definitely a diva to begin and becomes more relatable as the story progresses. I've recommended it to my friends.
1,Total Garbage,"This book is complete garbage. I should have read the review before reading this book. It would have saved me some wasted time. I really don't know where to begin with how awful this book is. Jen Lancaster is patently unlikeable and the footnotes are ridiculous. It was a surprise to read her overly flattering descriptions of herself and compare them to the image in the book. What a shock! That itself was worth a good laugh, but that is the ONLY one. I suppose we are meant to believe that Jen is a worthwhile person by the end of the book. Afterall, she adopted a pit bull and drank boxes of wine. That was so brave and charitable."
1,Tedious tale from superficial egomaniac,This non-fiction tale (sprinkled with heavy doses of fiction) has a promising start but eventually falls under the weight of its snide and self-absorbed narrator. Most of the reviews here seem to have been written by Jen Lancaster's friends and family network. I have never met said author but would guess she is probably as unbearable in person as she is on the written page.
3,Fun read,"This is a fun read, That being said, I am sure 20, 30 & 40 somethings would enjoy it more that 50 something.Easy to read and a few good laughs."
5,Must read!,"Ladies, if you want to laugh out loud, buy this and any other of Ms. Lancaster's books. She tickles my funny bone."
3,This title really does say it all!!!,"Reading this is like watching Jerry Springer, you pretty much hate everyone involved and yet you are mesmerised by the fact that some people have no shame and will reveal anything about themselves that the saner members of the Universe would not divulge under threat of well, personal embarassment at the least. While she seems to view herself as amusing, even justified, I think the correct words would be malevolent and venomous. It is an interesting memoir of narcissism as an art form!"
4,Hysterical !,"This book was GREAT ! Easy read, laugh out loud all the way through. You have to appreciate the tone the author uses to get the jokes - or you will end up TOTALLY missing the point. Jen took lemons and made a margherita! I am looking forward to the next one. Jen and Janet (Evanovich) - great beach book authors! I highly recommend :)"
5,Entertaining,"It is Shopaholic meets Bridget Jones meets ?I really enjoyed the style of writing, it keeps you turning the pages. Quite a fun read. Glad to have stumbled upon it."
1,Horrible is too nice a word for this book,"I was given this book by a publishing friend as an example of how not to write a book. This book seemed like one of those so bad it is good movies but never got anywhere but horrendous. Penguin publishing is embarrassed to have published this. The inside joke around the Co. is working with ""Jennsylvania"" was like playing with a retarded puppy. You try to be nice knowing it has no choice but to be pathetic."
2,awful,"Who told this woman that mean is funny? A very immature woman, incredibly materialistic and shallow. I just don't like her, and I really didn't care about her."
1,This book was a waste of hours I'll never get back,"Book club selection. Felt compelled (b/c it was a book club selection and I always finish them) to read the whole thing. Painfully bad. Not funny and as a Chicagoan, the picture painted in this book of my city is unrecognizable. Watching beige paint dry would be more enjoyable than this book I have to say..."
1,I Don't Get All The Fuss,"This is an obnoxious person, writing about her obnoxious life and we're supposed to be entertained by it? I have no idea how this became a best seller, except if the author bought a million copies of her own book (which wouldn't surprise me based on her personality). Maybe I've met one too many people who act like this in real life - but the fact that the author is now making money off of her own self centeredness is repulsive. If you want to lose brain cells - go ahead and buy it. It's not entertaining - more like, anger invoking."
2,Too bitter.,"I wanted to like this book. I love snarky, witty, acerbic humor. I am myself snarky and acerbic. Sadly, I just couldn't like this. It was frankly too bitter without being charming. I guess I am not into bags, tags, or shoes enough to relate at all to the heroine. I just found her rude, boorish, and unfunny. I guess the title sums it up pretty well."
5,Great Read for Young Professionals,"hilarious. i laughed out loud numerous times on my commute. highly recommended for professional women, esp. in the early stages of career. a great, easy read for commuters."
4,I was really surprised,I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this book. It's funny and sarcastic but very honest. I appreciate that it didn't center around some fairy tale ending.
5,An egomaniac that deserves it.,"I couldn't even begin to understand how Jen went through what she did while keeping such an original sense of humor. Even from page one, when she is a holier-than-thou prada girl, you can't help but love her. Imagine Karen from Will and Grace, only with a work ethic.Even more hillarious is Jen when she is humbled by unemployment and weight gain. I about peed myself at the part where she went to the fitness expo for a friend and asked one of the marathon runners for a cigarette. Pure genuis.Smartass? Yes. A little over the top? Sure. Inflated ego? Possibly. But this woman deserves to say what she wants, when she wants because most of all, she is extremely witty and eloquent (ie: ""asshat"")."
2,review,"book was used, i bought it new. wasnt so happy about that. semi fast shipment. was reimbursed two dollars. Wasnt happy about that either. Book is still readable. Just wish i wouldnt have paid for the cost of a new book when i recieved a definitely USED one."
1,horrible...horrible...ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"a little while back i found myself in the bathroom without tp....fortunately i had a copy of this book. at least i put it to the only use it has. seriously, do not believe the cookie cutter clone reviews who all think this book is the next of mice and men..save your $15 and buy 1/4 of a prada purse."
1,Outdated - Not Current With Laws - Poor Material,"This book is grossly outdated and should not be sold as an investigative resource or reference. The author references using pay phones of all things. It is not current with recent privacy laws, the internet, databases, etc. and makes no mention of these.One chapter has no reference to finding people and is filled with personal safety tips. The title is misleading, even for it's day, which may have been in the 70's or 80's.I should have checked the publication date before purchasing."
2,Cant handle really low frequencies,"This subwoofer goes ballistic when it tries to handle very low frequencies, in movies such as fight club, I am very disapointed in this subwoofer, maybe my standards are too high."
3,Pac-Mania,"This version of Pac Man is actually very entertaining and great for those pac fans who prefer playing a computer game over the playstation version. It has many different levels, scenery, and enemies which will keep you interested. It also features bonus levels or mazes. Parents; this is a cute, innocent game for your kids to play if you are looking for a ""good"" game for the computer."
1,Disappointing--you can find a better way to spend $50.,"This book doesn't come close to covering the exam material. I took the exam once already and failed--and I would fail again if I relied on this book. I don't think anyone who is new to this topic should buy this book; start elsewhere. Fortunately, I was able to return this trash to a bookstore that did not realize that this was test preparation material."
1,"If you want to pass the CCNA exam, buy something else!!","What a joke! This Sybex book was confusing, expensive, inaccurate, and perhaps the most poorly written excuse for a study guide. It seems par for the course with the other Sybex books I've seen."
4,Passed CCNA Test today,"I took the CCNA test today and passed the test with a 74% score. The CCNA Study Guide got me over the hump. I was using the CCNA Syngness book, which helped a little, but the book by Todd Lammle put me over the edge. I had used his books for my MSCE and they really helped.There is really no substitute for hands on with Cisco routers, but this book helped me pass the exam. I will purchase his next book, Advanced Cico Router Configuration. There are still some question that I had not seen in either book.Study hard and good luck.Richard CockrellCCNA, MCSE, MCP + Internet, CNA and CNE"
4,A very complete guide to CCNA certification,My only compaint about the book is that the answers to the questions following each chapter are printed immediately. The answers should be at the back of the book to make it more difficult.
5,OUSTANDING BOOK,Sybex does it again. They just don't seem to miss with study guides. Passed the first time
3,This guy needs to take an English course,"While this book is informative, it is painful to read. The author is attempting a (very) laid back stying approach and he's pretty horrible at it.The Cisco ICRC book is much easier to read, and it doesn't give me a headache."
5,A Solid Study Guide.,"This is probably the best, well-rounded study guide available for the CCNA.The book assumes that you have access to a Cisco router, like the Cisco 250X models. The labs at the end of the chapters require access to a router. I would consider access to a Cisco router a must for using this book properly.Add this book and access to a Cisco router, and you should be all set."
3,Disappointed!,"This book will get you started, but this book alone IS NOT all you need to pass the CCNA exam! Todd's explaination of key concepts were very unclear. I had to buy another book, ICRC, to fill in the gaps. Whatever you learn from this book, do not commit it to you thought processes when trying to understand the material. It will confuse you!"
2,Could Be Much Better,"While I passed the CCNA exam with a 925 I think that this book had little to do with that. It contains many errors and the questions are often silly and overly specific. Furthermore it was not clear to me before purchasing that the questions on the CD were the same ones as in the book. Also the question software on the CD is rather buggy, and calls into question the accuracy of its answers. I intend to pursue further Cisco certifications, but not with the help of books by this turkey."
2,"ok, but not written by a CCIE","I came out of the testing facility wishing I had stuck to Cisco Press. I read to many books and wasted time again! Sure this book would have done it but, while I was testing, the Cisco books came to mind when aswering the questions. I think that is how I was really able to tell the difference between the books. If you had asked me before the test I would have said the Sybex book is the choice because of the writing style but the style did not come to mind during testing, content did.The Sybex was not written by a CCIE or technically reviewed by a CCIE. I figured this out after the test...bummer for me. I should have done my reserch. I am glad the company bought the books, so glad!"
2,Just for really fresh beginners !!,"The content are just cover the surface of CCNA not touching the depth, and its have too much error information...definitely for freshman to know what is about CCNA but not for preparing exam.."
5,I passed the new CCNA in only 45 minutes!,"I received a 933 score out of 78 questions. I used this book, Todd's routersim.com product and his CCNA Exam Notes book. I would recommend all three if possible. The routersim.com product gave me the hands-on experience I needed to feel confident when I took the exam. The CCNA Study Guide and Notes books are fantastic. If you want to understand what is on the CCNA new exam, then at least get this book."
5,Very well written book!,"I bought two 2500 series routers, and this book. This was all I needed to pass the test. I had no router experience prior to this. With the help of this book and the easy to follow labs, I scored a 925. Great book. Thank you Todd!"
5,Simply the best,"This book is one of the greatest books I've ever read about CCNA. It's so easy to understand. If you are taking the CCNA test, I suggest you to buy this book and keep it for later reference.Thanks"
4,Good for certification purposes only,"If you need a kind of recipe to pass the exam and you don't mind in not knowing how to explain why some things are the way they are, this book is fine; all the necessary information is inside.However, if you are interested in getting a more conceptual knowledge, forget about it. This book is very very exam oriented."
3,This book is in no way a complete introduction!,"This book's coverage of the objectives is very superficial. The fact that the appendices make up over 40% of the text is a clear indication that this book lacks real content. I would recommend using other sources in addition to this, not only for passing exam 640-407 but also, for a more complete view of routing and its application in today's LANs and WANs. It seems to me that this book is best suited for someone having a lab or using Todd's Routersim product. If you have either of these, doing the labs will go a long way in preparing you for the exam. I passed with an 897 and there is no way I would have done it with this book alone."
3,Get the book for the newer version,"I have just graduated high school, where I took the first 2 semesters of the Cisco Academy CCNA course. I took the third one during the summer and then registered for the CCNA. I spent 1 1/2 weeks reading this book and taking sample tests and one day reading the book for the new version and taking sample tests. Then, I took the CCNA and passed with a 875. This book has errors but it prepares you well for the test. However, I recommend the book for the new version of the CCNA because it is more indepth and contains the ""higher-caliber"" questions that are on the new test. Good luck!"
4,"A good study guide, but too blabby...","Started with this book on the way to my CCNA and ended up dropping it for the ICND by Cisco Press. ICND is a very concise & to the point textbook. It covered all I needed to pass the test in one shot. Have been a fan of many Sybex books and this one is good, too. Just found it to have a little too much ""fluff"" for my taste. Especially as diverse & extensive the amount of information you need to have crammed in your head to pass your CCNA. Know the ICND & practice with the Test Out! practice exams and you'll nail your CCNA."
4,"This is a good book to prepare for the exam. However,","This is a good book to prepare for the exam .However, I think Cisco's recently published ICRC book is a much better reference guide. I am a MCSE , MCP+I, and just got my CCNA two days ago, I focused part time on this book one week, and got 80%, and I read the ICRC book after test to find out lots of info was there. If I had spared some time on ICRC , I would have got higher score for sure. Of cause , if you can put your hands on routers, it will guanrantee your first time pass . Good luck."
5,So Pleased!,"I bought this specific rose variety recently for myself because I bought the same ones about three years ago for my mom and hers have grown from a small plant into a giant rose bush and it has flourished. It gets lots of blooms, can survive horrendous heat, and the color is rich. I like the way Hirt's packages the roses to protect them during shipping."
4,OSO Easy Paprika Rose,"I purchased the OSO Paprika Rose from Hirt's Gardens thru Amazon.com. I was very pleased with the delivery time & packing. The rose bush was small but in very good condition. I'm only giving it a four star rating, because I've only had it a week, and I want to see how it does...So far so good!"
5,A book u HAVE to read unless ur crazy,"Janice Galloways unique technique of writing is very significant in this book, as Joy the maain character is slowly slipping into madness the techniques used show how she feels for example when people talk to joy she uses a script to show how joy thinks nothing said to her s genuine. Also Janice uses joys home outside of glasgow to show her isolation. i recommend this book to everyone. and if u do read it it will show u how we r all so close to maddness ourselves."
5,Tribute to the resilence of life,"The Trick is to keep Breathing is certainly one of the best books I've read all year. Both depressing and uplifting, it swings your emotions wildly from one end of the scale to another. Although the content is obviously somewhat depressing, the wry humour Galloway injects at the most unexpected moments sent me from tears to laughter in seconds. In the end, it is a book about the resilence of life and the inexorable fact that when someone dies, the rest of us have to keep on living without them. In my opinion this book should have been short-listed for the Booker but I understand from Scottish writers that cronyism amongst the English 'set' prevented it."
1,Coby CA-55R 50 Watt International Converter,The item cannot be used in Europe alone. It needs an extra unit so it can be used there (particularly France and Eastern Europe). The extra unit must be purchased separately since they send me only the adapter. So bare this in mind if someone wants to use it in these particular areas.
4,Nice cover,"Fits the car well, ordered mid size and it's just right. Folds up easily into a compact attached bag. I wish it had been a little more water resistant, but it was a heavy rainstorm."
1,Look for another car cover,"Admittedly, I chose this car cover because I was looking for something economical to use for my Toyota 4-Runner.I ordered the larger size because I wasn't sure if the smaller one would work. The car cover fits about as well as a circus tent on a fence post. That was my fault for ordering the larger size.The ""front"" of the car cover is totally unmarked. So I've never been sure how it was supposed to fit - maybe I've been putting it on backwards, but it is impossible to tell because the fit is so lousy, anyway. Because it's so baggy with only one place to tie it down, it blows off of my 4-Runner every time anyone walks by the house and farts.To add insult to injury, the eyelet where you can insert a rope to hold the cover on the car popped-off the second time I used it. So, now I can't tie it down without worrying about the fabric tearing.Bottom line: spend a little more money and get something that works!"
1,is not water-repellent...,its exactly for my nissan versa hb. But not is water-repelent.I do not recommend this product unless you keep you vehicle in a garage 100% of the time.the image does not correspond to the product.
4,teen titans rule,my son loves all the teen titan characters so he really loves this toy. the only problem with this toy is that the head keeps popping off. i hope it lasts more than the poor headless robin he has
2,I lost interest,"I have read lots of books written by spouses of firefighters, and was disappointed in this one. It really failed to hold my interest. I never did finish reading it."
2,Book was written about FireMEN not FireFIGHTERS.....,"I heard about this book and was going to buy it, but from what I read it seems to refer to the Firefighters as male. Being a FEMALE Firefighter, I was going to buy it for my loved ones to read, but felt that it really did not apply to me. What a huge disappointment. Just when I thought there was a book to help people understand what it is like to live with a Firefighter, I find out that it only applies to the loved ones of the Male Firefighters. Sorry, this isn't supposed to be a Women's rights kind of blog, but we are into another whole millenium...is it still not known that there ARE female firefighters out there???"
5,A necessity for friends & family of FireFighters,"Even though I completed this book I will keep it on my nightstand regardless. After reading ""I Love a Fire Fighter"", I feel so much better about how to relate to my Fire Fighter husband. I really feel prepared to handle his highs and lows as well as the dangers he faces every day. This book is such an invaluable tool, and I really loved the individual stories by real-life fire fighters and their families. My husband also read the book and found it highly enjoyable and realistic."
4,Skips in cheaper DVD players,"A couple of the DVDs would skip when I tried playing them in my cheaper DVD player in my bedroom. It would get stuck on one part of the disc, and wouldn't play.I put it in my BlueRay player in my living room, and it played fine. I checked the disc, and there were no visible scratches or scuffs on it, so it doesn't appear that the previous owner was rough on their discs. It was probably a defect in the disc itself at the manufacturer. In any event, it would only work in the more expensive DVD players (I'm assuming they have much better lasers/readers)."
1,Dexter DVDs not what was expected,The 3 season DVD set was purchased as a gift. Apparently all the DVDs have English subtitles on them that cannot be removed. I am told that trying to watch the DVD with the subtitle is so annoying it is almost not worth the effort.The packaging the DVDs were in was so poor that I am told it fell apart when the plastic film around it was removed.I have purchased from Amazon many times before and this is the first time the purchase was such poor quality.
2,Is the Fair in Town?,"The Fabriclive series is highly praised by some, but out of the half-dozen or so albums I've heard so far, only one has received a thumbs up from this reviewer (Fabriclive.16 by Adam Freeland). The others are either dreadful or just average. Fabriclive.09 by Jacques Lu Cont is a set that contains one good track (""Gold Is Your Metal""). The others are average electro-funk tracks or dubs/re-edits of music that originally fell into rock or pop genres. I hate it when a rock/pop/alternative track gets edited into a pseudo-electronica track. Unlike genuine electronica, the original music was not designed to be set to a beat and does injustice to both the original genre the music was taken from and the world of electronica. Examples from this album include: ""Abracadabra"", ""Sweet Dreams"", and ""I Wanna Rock!"". Tacky, tacky, tacky! Music you would expect to hear at a county fair. Thumbs down for Fabriclive.09.2.5/5 stars."
4,works as expected mostly...,but some of my old Power Point files can't be retrieved. This made me disappointed a bit although the root cause is unknown.
4,Cobra B,Cobra has been a good brand name in CB's for years It was eazly installed . Amazon 's price was best that I had found and was very impressed with the customer service received at Amazon. I have had limited use as primary use was to be for use on road while traveling so far have not taken trip to use and local activity is very low for use would recomend Cobra
2,Fuji camera,"Many of the pictures were""fuzzy."" Flashes didn't work on some cameras. When developing the store had to load on individual disc instead of one disc."
5,It works.,I have several of Wenger's knives. This case is the one I use the most as it fits the largest of them so will also work well for the medium and smaller size (3.5 inch long) ones. I have tried others of softer glove leather that feel nice but was afraid I was going to tear it off my belt just pulling the larger knife out. If you need rugged this is it period.
4,interesting and provocative but a bit heavy going,"Book requires some advanced knowledge of economics and economic theory, but if one stays with it, it offers some very intriguing insights about our political economy, which are not likely to be found in the mainstream media."
1,very disappointing,"This sounded like a good book and really wanted to be a good book but just fell short. Mr. Tough Guy falls in love with the heroine while ON HIS WAY to meet her. Huh? While riding toward the keep that is now his, he starts feeling all these tender feelings...WTF??As for the heroine--she is the one meant by the phrase ""Too Stupid To Live"". She has been terrorized and brutalized but...(and this sentence is repeated several times).....There Was Nothing She Could Do! I don't know, how about opening your mouth and SAYING something???I got eyestrain from the number of times I had to roll my eyes at these fools. By halfway through the book, I was just flipping ahead to get it over with."
4,Pretty good,"It's a pretty good CD. I like it. I recommend it. ""Jump, Jive an' Wail"" is an AWESOME song. The only 2 songs I don't like on this CD are Pennsylvania 6-5000 and Gettin' In the Mood. They were Glenn Miller songs from the 40's and I was disappointed that Brian Setzer changed them too much. It would have been better if he played them more like the original versions. But anyway, the CD is still really good."
1,Trip to Marineville by Swell Maps (Vinyl),"We have not received the record; have been in contact with the person/company I bought it from (via email, but they have not tracked the shipment. I am very unsatisfied for I have paid for the record ($30) and have not gotten it.I give a zero (0) rating"
1,The Fortune Tellers by Howard Kurtz,"This book is a complete waste of my time and money. I did not enjoy reading about character flaws in people such as Jim Cramer,Mark Haines, and Barton Biggs. Howard Kurtz doesn't tell his readers anything that they should know, for example;stock analysts will pump up the stocks that they or their companies own. The market forecasts by people like Ralph Acampora are merely his best guess and most people realize this and do not move money based on anything Ralph says. After reading this book,I feel like my time should have been spent reading something else that was more interesting and informative."
2,"Interesting in places, but not enough places","The book begins well, and it's certainly interesting to read about the relationships between companies, analysts and the financial media. The stuff in here should be enough to make any investor nervous. This said, I got the feeling that Kurtz ran out of the really interesting stuff somewhere about a third of the way through the book and even though he increases the pace of the events in an effort to make it sound interesting, I found myself getting bored.Ultimately, I didn't really learn anything new-- not about the media, not really about Wall Street-- a little bit about CNNfn, but I'm not so sure that I needed to know that. It isn't a bad read if you've got nothing better to do, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
5,STATE OF EMERGENCY REVIEW,"I have not read it, but a friend who bought it said it is a MUST requirement before any American gets a Drivers' license, so important is the information."
3,xenophobia or rational position?,"Buchanan, makes an impassioned argument that the country is in a 'state of emergency' because of our neglegence in dealing with the immigration issue. However, many of the arguments seem to steam from a fear that America is losing its traditional anglo-identity, and not rational arguments that show why largre-scale immigration is such a great evil for this country. While he does makes some good points and back them up with some statistics, most of the time is just trying to scare people with anticdotal evidence. I conclude that Buchanan's book, while completely correct that we need to pay attention to the immigration issue and that there could be catastrophic effects for neglecting it, fails to ever show that a large mexican immigration is a bad thing just that there needs to be restrictions in place on who we let in and what we require of them."
1,"Noise distorted in playback, flimsy build, lots of","Bought nearly a dozen of these for a music class for kids to play/record their quizzes assignments at home and turn them in. Should have payed a little more for a better model. The sound is distorted during playback, especially in the higher pitch register. This is primarily for instruments, but even in the mid-upper vocal register the sound gets really distorted. I tested several of them with brand new batteries, different brand microtapes, they are all the same. Bad sound, and a TON of 'air static' pickup. You get what you pay for. But in this case, however, the degree of sound distortion is definitely a defect/flaw, even if it's by design. I will try to return these for better models."
1,Cheap.,"I love the Look/Shimano cleat wedges. They work fantastic. These however are terrible. The wedges stop the serrations on the bottom of the SPD cleat from digging into your shoe. This is actually a necessary thing for the cleat to do because otherwise it will slip. I couldn't get my cleat to stop moving with these shims in no matter how hard I tried. If you tighten them down to the point where the cleat almost stops moving, you essentially push the cleat right trough the wedges. I would like to see a metal version of these. Perhaps one that ""lock-and-key"" fits the bottom of the SPD cleat, and has a mimicked surface to the bottom of an SPD cleat. All and all this is a descent design, but crappy material choice."
1,fell flat,"my daughter and i LOVE to make books, we would staple a few sheets of paper together onthe side and then fill in the empty pages! i thought that this book would be a good resource and maybe give me some ideas(im not that creative, but my kid is) i didnt like this book at all, i would have given it less stars, they took something that could be so easy and beautiful and over did it BIG TIME. i mean i dont know how to ""hand bind books"" our staple binded are working just fine! im sure a more formal approch to making books as stated in this book are nice and pretty but its too complicated."
4,Chris,"I did'nt particulally get into this sitcom when it first aired but asI begine to catch reruns on the syndicated station here, it started to growon me. I now consider it to be up there with alot of the classic AfricanAmerican tv shows. I guese the show eventually went off the air as mostsitcoms that feature child stars as they out grow the show. What was appealingabout the show to someone in my age group is the mature nature of the show.I also like the Simpson's for the same reason, even though I'm not usually into cartoons unless they are the old Warner Brothers type. I also like the gueseappearances of some Icons from black sitcomes from the 70s on EHC."
1,Wow.,"I don't even know what to say. It's so bad in the beginning, and manages to get worse for what feels like 4 hours straight. By far the worst movie ever made, by anyone, ever. I'm dumber for watching it. In closing, it wasn't good."
2,The True Story of PISS in Boots,"We decided to give this film a fair chance and watched all 80 minutes.We had thought this would a great educational film for children as we recognized famous pieces of western music such as, Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", Mozart's ""Magic Flute"" and Verdi's ""Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves."" All of which were perverted by amateur remixing.The theme and moral of the film teaches children that bearing false witness will grant you women, fame, and fortune. Not to mention the awkward moment when Peter and the Princess are found in an empty bedroom in which they say ""Soooo, now what?"" There is also a question of what the film makers are implying by introducing a talking Jamaican monkey.If you look past the discontinuity of the plot, the poor voice overs, the animation, and the creeper chamberlain (weird pedophile pants!!!!), it was still an horrible film!!! Expel this from your TV like your body would expel urine."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!',This truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.........I warn you do not watch unless you feel like being bored out of your mind and aggravated!!!!!!
1,One of the worse movies ever made,"This movie is just a miserable, horrible failure. The voices sound like they were recorded under water. The characters look like something out of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It is devoid of any humor or excitement. The dialogue doesn't sync up with the mouthing of the words. It lurches from one scene to the next and at times without connecting them. This is not a movie an actor brags about being in."
1,probably the worst movie ever,I watched all of Hamberger U & couldn't get 5 minutes into this one. Glad it was a red box
1,Annoying would be an understatement,"Couldn't get past the cat's voice. I don't care if this is the Shrek version or the real, ""French"" version, this movie is horrible. The cat's voice is a man (Shatner?) who talks in a shrilly high voice and is constantly making noise. All kinds of noise. Sound effects, screaming, etc. It's like watching someone scratch their fingers on a chalk board. I rented it for a dollar and enjoyed the lesson I learned... again. I wonder how many times I'll get ripped off for not staying current on children's movies...shame on me. Learn from my mistakes and don't get this movie."
1,Not worth the money or time!,"I thought I was getting the Dreamworks version when I rented it. The voices in this movie were creepy and did not match up well with the characters. I would have given it 1/2 star if I could. William Shatner's voice as Puss in Boots sounds very odd - like he has a cold and is trying to whisper. There is lots of music and singing in this movie, but it was weird as well. Do not waste your money or time on this one."
2,Confusing Book,"This book, just like all of his, ""Professor Sham Tickoo"" other books, including the Pro/E Wildfire series is not extremely rich in pedagogy and you require at least one or two years of design experience to understand the book layout and to be productive.I do not understand all of the five star ratings for this book from the various people that have written in from; Spain, Iran, India, or Pakistan. Maybe they understand English better than I do?Professor Tickoo has a group of writers for his books; AutoCAD, AutoLISP, 3ds max, 3ds viz, Mechanical Desktop, Pro/Engineer, Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, etc. You can tell that the books are not of the same quality. This book is confusing to a new user, and every more if you are looking for a book to be used as a training or teaching tool. I would not recommend this book. this is not the one."
2,Makes a great paperweight!,"I bought this radio because I wanted to try out the long wave band and the AM, FM and shortwave bands. The others perform ok, but longwave band is very poor, it would not receive any NDB's or weak transatlantic LW broadcast from overseas even with a loop antenna. The radio does well with receiving local AM and FM broadcasts but overloads bad on FM. The AM band does OK with receving semi local and distant AM stations at night. The shortwave band only picks up a few shortwave stations in the daytime and is ok receiving shortwave stations at night with some intermod from a local FM station. You need a long wire antenna for indoors witha telescoping rod connector. The radio is ok for beginners and traveler's who visit places that require a paperweight throwaway radio. Good for antenna experimenters still."
3,Coby Radio,This produce fell a little below expectations. It has not held up well but for the price it is okay. Shipped quickly but was smaller than I thought and didn't realize it was battery operated.
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this radio so I could listen to the radio while I work around the house, without bothering my family. I specifically wanted to hear NPR. This radio would work if I stood in one spot, but as soon as I move it loses the signal. Kind of defeats the purpose of a portable radio. I guess you get what you pay for, but with this radio I got even less, because I can't use it at all."
4,A good product at a good price...,"This product does its job: Which is to protect the Palm. (They can, and do, break, you know, if you drop them without protection).The strap holds the Palm in the case securely, as does the ingenious snap-in docking mechanism. There are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash. But this only works as a wallet in a pinch.On the down side, the case does roughly double the depth of the Palm Vx, but the way I see it, that's the price of protection."
2,Nice-until the rail falls off,"Nice looking, good feel. But my rail pulled off the rubber binding after 6 months of light use."
1,nice try but no go,"This wallet protected the face of my Palm but did not protect the on-off switch sufficiently. The Palm almost always would turn on while in my purse, which drained the battery (after numerous such events). I returned it."
2,Not made for product,The case itself looks nice and fuctional. The stylus that is supposed to hold the palm in place is to big to fit in the appropriate slot of the Palm.
3,No diagrams or figures for Kindle!,"I purchased this book for my CRM class in school and just read the first few chapters. The kindle edition does NOT include the figures and diagrams referenced in the text. Very disappointed in that. Amazon keeps stating that the kindle is just like the book, but this is the second time I have purchased a book without the figures or photos. The slow adoption of traditional page numbers is also frustrating, but that is more a ding o Amazon and not this book.Bottom line, this kindle version has no diagrams or figures."
3,These are ok,I bought these after I read a lot of hype on the internet. But for the price all I would say is these are ok.
2,"Nice sock, but Amazon's Product description is incorrect!","hi,I like the socks but am disappointed that I only received 1 pair of socks. Here is amazon's product description for this product: Product Description THORLOS RUNNING LOW CUT 3 PK. I assumed the price was for 3 pair of socks. The pack I received only contained 1 pair. My pack has upc code 036383000320.Not worth the hassle to ship them back to Amazon. I just hope this review helps someone not make the same mistake I did.thanks"
3,Thorlo is great quality,"You can't beat Thorlo for comfort, cushion, longevity and looks. I did listen to a woman who suggested getting a larger size because hers were skimpy at the toe. Don't go there. My socks are now too big for my skinny foot. I wear a 9 shoe and she wore a 10. Get the sock size you normally wear. My mistake over years of buying the socks. I'm hoping to shrink them with hot water because they are the best for the extra price."
2,Despite picture this pot does not come with a lid,"The pot is fine, however, it does not come with a lid. I called Amazon and was told that I had understood the listing correctly, it should have a lid. They talked me into having them ship me another one because the first one was probably just a packing error. The second one came without a lid also. Now I had two pots to send back. I called them again and was told that they would send this info to the lT department to get the listing fixed. I just looked at the listing and it still shows a lid even though it has been several weeks. I was trying to buy this pot for Thanksgiving, 2012. It is now January 31, 2013. So if you need a lid you will not get it with this pot. I gave it two stars instead of one because the pot itself seemed to be good."
1,Extreme Intolerance & Poor Scholarship,"Qutb's book is a study in cultural chauvinism, filled with denigration of foreign cultures and religions. In a clash between tradition and modern, Qutb seeks refuge in reactionary rejection of the present and fantasies of some Golden Age that probably never was. He retreats to radical interpretations of the Quran, which he claims are the ""original"" ones, but which contradict the Quran itself. The Quran calls Jews and Christians, ""People of the book"". Qutb calls the 'jahili', barbarians. The Quran has five pillars: daily statement, daily prayer, Hajj, Ramadan, charity. Qutb replaces these with his favoirte, ""jihad"". Mohammed himself calls battle jihad ""the small jihad"", and prefers the ""big jihad"" of overcoming ones self. Qutb ignores this totally. So essentially, Qutb replaces the Quran with his own distorted reading of it, based on culture shock and bigotry, and has the audacity to call his own extremists views the ""true"" Islam."
1,Islamic Barbarism,"There is much in this book which can only be described as wicked, debased, and an insult to all decent civilized human values. I can't imagine anyone wanting to live in a society governed by Qutb's life hating dictates. Read it to know your enemy, then burn it."
5,Pricey but good,"I purchased these recently and they all worked fine, not a single coaster in the bunch. I tried several other brands and they worked fine, the dreaded Memorex DL,and some from USDigitalMedia DL they all seem to be ok. The Verbatim were more expensive but they weren't that much more. I'll try some other brands and see what happens,seems to me there are alot of defective discs out there."
5,DL DVD,Great product for duplicating two hours of video. No issues when using Roxio Toast. The price point was the best for all available options.
2,Bought 30 x8 speed disk package and got 8 coasters,I got the 30 disk package and I got 8 coasters that sucked I was pretty mad and I'm a pretty good when comes to burning next time will give 50 pack 4x speed give a shot I never so many bad disk at the most I have 3 bad
5,Love It,I Love This Brand Was Using Memorox Wasnt Workin Until I Tried Verbatim Works Perfect The Best CD Brand There Is.
5,No problems at all,Delivery was a couple days early.No problems with initial dvd burns. No coasters yet.This was my first time using dual layers disks. Will definitely purchase these again...
5,Works Fine / Be Sure Your Drive Supports Them,"Not a bad disk in the bunch; all gone and all good.I'm using a Memorex external USB DVD burner to write and I can play back using the stock drive on my one-year old HP Pavillion desktop.For anyone new to double layer DVD's, be sure your burner and intended playback drives support the format, particularly if your hardware is older. Even newer machines can come with older DVD drives so check their specs online for your specific model and confirm both write and read for double layer. If you're running Windows you can get the drive model from the Device Manager."
5,Won't fail you,"Trust me, I just ordered my second set of these. Every one of the previous 30, every one, worked!! THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!!! If you need dual layer discs for the size DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THESE!!! Peace"
2,Bad News DVDs,"I've recorded on many DVD+R discs on my Sony GX-355 without any problems. I've used the first 2 out of 5 of these Verbatum DL DVDs so far and both have failed. . After 1 and 1/2 hour of recording, ""disc err"" appears and then the signal ""this disc can neither be played nor recorded""."
4,Verbatim 96542,a good buy for the price. These dvrs work well for basic recording. sdfjkl sjdfkls jlkdsfjsdjdfls sjdkfl fff sss ssss
1,All discs were wasted,"I used to use cheaper discs, but being important date I wanted to use good DVDs and I thought Verbatim were really good, but after writing, all the discs failed to read, even with a successful complete, the DVD just would not read."
2,Lacking lots of fruit tree information,"There is a fair amount of information if you mostly want to grow certain nut trees (pecan, walnuts, hazelnuts) and citrus. I would have liked to see a lot more information on less common nut varieties (e.g., chestnuts, pine nuts, etc.) And there was little to no information on apple, pear, plum, etc. There are better books that cover fruit in general, and there are citrus specialty books if that's your main interest."
1,Buyer BEWARE!,"Product is NOT Verbatim brand as advertised. It is a generic cartridge, not branded. Shop accordingly!"
5,I REALLY want this on DVD,Funny movie! Has one of the most entertaining car chases I ever saw. The cop flips off the criminal instead of the other way around.
2,Objective Student,"Has many well written college essays, however, the analyses are lacking. The analyses offer nothing to reader other than meaningless phrases of praise such ""good attention grabber."" It seems many of the analyses can be applied to any number of essays. Phrases such as ""Good attention grabber"" and ""strong narrative/descriptive/expository structure"" do nothing to aid in overall understanding.More essays and less analysis would be helpful.Also examples of bad essays would be useful, not just the good ones."
5,Most Comprehensive Ever,"I think that the thing I found most helpful about this book, is that the illustrations show normal articulation and then have the traumatized area together for easier comparisons. This book covers everything from cellular biology to disease pathology and histology. It's worth the money to have this book as a resource in your library."
2,Very poor photo quality in this printing,"Just received a copy of this book (a second copy for my lab), and the quality of this printing is terrible. The paper used is different (not glossy like previous printings). As a result, the quality of the photographs is very poor - which is very problematic for a book on paleopathology. I will be returning this book immediately. If you are thinking about purchasing this book, please be aware that the printing may be problematic."
4,"Loved, but puzzled","I too love the play, I Never Saw Another Butterfly. I have directed it twice and have learned something new about the period each time. I am wondering now, after analyzing the piece, would the name be pronounced Raja with a 'j' sound or would it be pronounced as Raya? In order to put my analysis of the script in complete perspective I need to know."
1,Very Irritating,The beginning of the book was slow and it continued through the whole book. The heroine was weak and very childish. The hero was deliberately annoying to her and immature. He was also a control freak. They never agreed on anything (out loud) and they never had any serious conversations long enough to learn about each other. The reader knew the characters but the characters didn't know each other.
2,it didn't last long,I clipped the blade on the wiper arm and the rivet on it broke in half not too happy about it
1,Wrong Wiper for XC90 Rear Window,"I ordered this online to replace the rear window wiper blade on my 2004 Volvo XC90. Unfortunately, it is not the correct blade for that application and it cannot be made to fit in any way. The space allowed for the connector is simply too small. The blade may be fine for other applications, but it does not work on the rear window of my 2004 Volvo XC90."
3,Good wiper wrong application,I purchased this for the rear window on a 06 Honda Oddyessy and the site showed tyhat it was the correct one for the vehicle. Idid not fit correctly when I tried to put it on. So I am still looking for a correct fit that is not overly expensive.
4,Was exactly what I needed,This product did exactly what I needed. I was able to get all the stuffed animals off my childs bed and up in this hanger. It was easy hang and she can still reach her favorite animals at the bottom.
1,Is this a joke?,"Since these razors are given the title ""Twilight"", I guess it's only appropriate that using one create's a vampire's wet dream. The razors are just about as bad as the series they share a name with, but that's another story.I thought maybe I'd just gotten one bad one when I cut my legs to bloody bits, so I tossed it. But tonight I tried another brand new one out of the package and tore up my armpit, too! The 'lubricant' is non-existent, which doesn't pair well at all with the booby trap triple blades. I don't have this issue with the four-bladed razors by the same company, but on the same note, I've never even cut myself up this bad when I was 13 using a man's single blade disposable.Word to the wise, do NOT buy these!"
1,Worst razor burn ever!,"I bought these razors years ago and they gave me bad razor burn. I bought them again a few weeks ago thinking ""surely they have improved these. There's no way they would still be on the market if they were still that bad."" Well they are. The only reason I got them was because I needed something and had a coupon. Lesson learned."
1,RC87,"How can Sony stop providing a BUS cable extension that is necessary to make many of there products work. The RC87 is a 7ft extension cable. Sony Customer service sent me 2 wrong cables because they just don't listen to what your asking for. They are just trying to get you off the phone. I really need the product or I would say the hell with it and rip the whole system out, except that I have over 10 hours of installation because of the difficulty of boat wiring runs. DOES ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA WhERE I CAN FIND A RC87 BU cable?????"
3,"Good price, but only fair quality","This imported gun is only fair, not professional quality. It does not appear to have the quality that will last for years and years. The smoothness of the lever action is somewhat lacking. It does not pump the grease into the fittings as easily as our other guns...it requires a lot more effort and in tight spots, this makes a difference."
2,works but has awful sound quality,"The sound quality was really bad, almost hurt my ears. The Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter turned out to be the right choice: easy to use, and good sound quality."
4,Review,The ONLY downside is sometimes it pauses your ipod if you jiggle the wire...the connection must be weak because the ipod pauses as if the plug was removed. Not a big deal.
3,bad quality,"I got this one to connect my music in my car, honestly it's really cheap made, i guess you get what you pay for, the 3.5mm jack was a tight fit, and in result the metal coating of it came of piece a piece, now the gig still works but i have to wiggle it from times to time in order for it co send sound to both sides of the car sound system. It still works, but it broke in just 2 days of use, so don't know how long ti is going to work. hope you find this review useful."
4,Good product for your old car without mp3 player,"I ordered this product after having seen it in my friends' acura. This was just perfect in his vintage acura, so i thought of ordering it for my camry.The product does its work but it makes some ticking noise continuously. Worth the money spent."
3,Does the Job but not Exceptional,"The adapter works well - most of the time. Sometimes it has issues where the tape deck will spontaneously reverse or the plug will wiggle loose. Overall, I'm glad that I bought it and the dual-direction plug is nice but it could certainly be a lot better."
2,Lasted 8 months,"I bought this product and used it with no problems for 8 months to play my iPod in my car. Then it started having problems. It started making sounds like the tape was switching sides, but would do it several times in one song. That problem lasted about a month, then it stopped working completely. Less than a year later, I'm shopping for a new cassette adapter."
1,Junk,"Product works fine then just goes haywire. It will start what sounds like changing tape direction- which stops the audio from playing out. This lasts from one to four seconds each time it happens.. Sometimes this happens just once....sometimes it happens over and over again. Also, the cassette adaptor will also eject it's self everyone in a while. I would not recommend this product."
5,Works great,I haven't had a single problem with it. It's been working great for the past month and I've been loving it.
5,Good tape player option for iPod and other MP3 players,"I had tried a Sony product that played a few times and then started stopping and being ejected. The Coby unit seems to be playing well with no ejection problems. From reviews elsewhere, it might offer some options if the ejection problem does resurface."
2,A below average quality product,"I was excited by seeing good reviews and reasonable price while placing order to buy this product. However, disappointed at the first use itself due to poor quality of sound and it was transmitting sound to only left channel of speakers. I did test my cassette player with normal tape cassette and it was playing perfectly. So finally, I have returned this. Also, the cassette is configured to play at B-side, however whenever I insert it, the player plays by default at A side, which cause eject of the adepter if you don't set play B-side at player immediate after every insert of adepter in the player."
1,Just didn't work,"I got this little thing this morning, to replace the one that's wearing out. I popped it in. Music started playing, and I was happy. Then it cut out. Then it played with static. Then it kept getting ejected by my tape deck. This kept going on for ten minutes until I just took it out and resumed using my old one. Extremely unsatisfied. What a hunk of junk."
2,Started out great,This adapter was working great. I was pleased with the sound and ease of use. However about a month ago the left channel will only work (and that's sometimes) if I adjust the cord that connects the IPOD just right. I have to keep playing with it and moving it around and then the channel will cut out and I have to play with it over and over. Now I'm trying to find a replacement. I'm afraid to try another one of these. It started out so well and now I'm so disappointed.Now all of a sudden I'm getting sudden tape reversal- sometimes every 2 minutes. I'm still looking for a replacement.
3,Works but sound quality not reliable,"It works. But sometimes the sound quality and volume fluctuate, especially when the road bumps a little. The instruction says you should when the sound dims you can turn the tape to the other side, or take out and put it back into the cassette player again. It usually does the trick but just annoying."
5,This works really well..even on my 1990 Chevy pickup,"I was a bit distrustful when I looked at this unit. Especially since Coby is known for making cheap products. But I must admit that this works really well. I use it in my 1990 Chevy Silverado, which has a front loading cassette player. This unit, along with my Sansa Clip+ MP3 player, is like having a high-priced CD player in my truck."
2,Volume Issue,"I got this product so that I could listen to podcasts in the car. I live in a big city and can't find a suitable station for those FM transmitters. Unfortunately, even with my mp3 player and car radio turned up all the way I can't get it loud enough to really follow my podcasts. I have not seen this particular complaint before and in fact do not remember a volume issue the first time I used the adapter, but there it is."
2,Breaks after a few months,"Bought this to listen to recorded books on my IPOD in the car. Works fine for a few months, then one channel went out (it was the wire leading into a connection, as it would come back in if I bent the wire just so), then that fix stopped working. These are cheap enough so I ordered another one which worked well for 5 or 6 months and then kept flipping back and forth between play and reverse (they are supposed to stay in one mode) so became basically unuseable. I'll probably try another brand, though from reviews it seems like all of these cassette adapters are cheaply made and don't last....so now I'm just listening to the IPOD with an earpiece in one ear while driving, OK for recorded books but not great."
1,"Only works for short time, then rejects all the time.","I was happy with this for a couple of weeks. I used this for 10-20 minute driving. Even though it was a little bit of noisy, over all it worked fine. After 3 hrs trip, it rejects all the time. if anybody knows how to fix this problem, please post here."
4,Work As Expected,"Given that you are converting your digital iPod or MP3 player to an analog cassette player that probably hasn't been use in awhile ( or ever), that this concept provides any measure of audio quality it amazing. But this Coby does the job. You lose some high and low frequencies in the translation, but unless you have an ultra high car stereo (then you probably have an MP3 port) you really aren't hearing those frequencies anyway. I move the unit from a Passat to an Outback, one the cassette goes the long way, the other the wide way, both work find with no cord binding. I have had no trouble with any autoreverse issues in either car. I select Dolby off on both factory decks for a wider range of sound. I have tried some different brands with all kinds of problems, and had none with the Coby. So if you have a stock deck, or aftermarket with no MP3 input, this is the way to go on the cheap. It sounds better than FM radio in both cars. For the price, it can't be beat."
2,Not a good item.,It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player. It kept wanting to stop and turn the tape over. Very annoying.
2,"Low quality, don't waste the time or money","Like some other reviews on here, I received this product, inserted it into my cassette deck, and plugged in an iPhone -- only to find that the right channel of the music wasn't working. No matter what I did (reinserting the cassette, fiddling with the plug, etc) I could not get the right half of any audio to work. Went to a local store and bought a different brand of cassette adapter (Maxell)...that one worked perfectly right away with full stereo sound. This Coby product has poor quality control, for whatever reason the right channel will not work (my guess would be a problem with the cable or plug). Don't waste your money, buy a different brand!"
1,Does not work,"Just very disappointed to say that it just does not work. The cassette just stops rolling, so not useful at all."
1,Terrible,"Bought it as brand new from Amazon. Everything came packaged, new, on time. The problem was the actual cassette adapter. Only one side of my car stereo works when I plug this in. Not only that, but the sound quality is terrible (Which I assume is due to the faulty product). I can't even return it because it came in a package that requires ripping, so I can't put back the plastic box since I used scissors. Don't buy this, better luck buying one for $0.99 and hope for the best with that."
4,Better than FM transmission.,"I followed on-line instructions to remove the part that interferes with auto-reverse function on some tape players. The unit works fine. There is mechanical noise from the cassette as it runs in the plaer, but this becomes negligable at travel volumes. At the price paid it is worth owning several as it is way more reliable and convenient than finding a clear FM frequency while traveling."
1,Not Coby and poor sound,My first surprise was that this was not a Coby brand as advertised. Instead it is a Griffin. I wouldn't really care too much about this if it worked as well as the Coby unit I got earlier. The sound quality was really poor rendering the product worthless. It is too cheap to bother to return. I will order a different unit from somewhere else. It seems that some people had better luck. Good luck to others.
1,Nothing Special.,"It works, but it is noisy. Good thing I crank my tunes or it would get annoying.Sometimes my 1998 Lexus ES300 will just simply not like the adapter at all and keep ejecting it, so I can't use it at all for that trip.Maybe my adapter is faulty, but I don't think so. I think it is just hard for the tape player to spin like most of the other adapeters on the market.Update - this thing never works now. ""Push tape in, reverse, reverse, eject."" That's what my music sounds like these days.I finally just chucked it in a dumpster."
2,Works...sometimes,I got this adapter recently. I use it in my Acura TL. I have to unplug it from my ipod most of the way to make it work right. THe plug usually falls out about 30 seconds after I do this. If I dont do this the tracks have no highs and you cant here the vocals.
1,Did not work in my car's tape player,"This adapter did not work in my car's tape player. My car tape-player has an auto-reverse feature that can not be disabled, so I assume I had the same problem that other reviewers noted. The description of this product should make it very clear that if you cannot disable the auto-reverse, do not buy this! I have since bought a different brand of adapter, and have had no trouble"
4,So Far So Good,"This is the second one I've bought (the first lasted about 3 months) - works great, just hoping I get more than 3 months out of this one."
1,Coby Cassete Adapter,"I bought this cassette adapter roughly 3 weeks ago and it has already stopped working properly. The best this device can do now is to play my music through one channel, (right or left) and that is if it works at all. I totally regret buying this thing, I'm just thankful that this lesson in car audio wasn't so costly."
1,Doesn't work.,Doesn't work. But daughter tossed packaging before she tried to use it. So I can't return it. Live and learn.
3,Need instructions on where to put it back together ..the springs!,I opened it and didn't see where the springs were.. If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much. Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition. It makes my blackberry phone sounds great. Dislike the radio so please help me.
5,Great Sound,I wasn't sure how the sound would be...however works great and I like the idea that it works with a front loading or side loading tape deck.
1,Doesn't Work With Every Vehicle,"This adapter would not work AT ALL in my 1996 Ford Ranger. The vehicle's cassette player kept ejecting it. However, it DID work in a co-worker's 1993 Ford Ranger. It also would not work in a 1993 Monte Carlo...same problem."
3,"Usually good, but sound comes and goes","I'm mildly satisfied with this cassette adapter. In general it works fine with no problems, but sometimes if you move the wire the sound gets lower or goes out completely. Like some previous reviews I would recommend plugging in your mp3 player first then inserting the casette adapter into the tape deck. If you don't do that it makes a loud popping sound and usually has more problems on that listen. Normally the adapter works without a hitch as long as I don't play around with the wire, but really that's an inconvenience and the adapter should not have that problem. Also, for you Ipod Touch users, if you move the wire around it goes into Voice control mode, which happens a fair amount, I think this is just an ipod issue but who knows."
5,MP3/Iphone Again!!,"Just recently got an older used second car for the family, which is ending up being my car. I was spoiled in the newer car with the direct MP3 plug to play Iphone/Music/etc through the car speakers. The older car has a cassette player only. This fits the bill perfectly. Back to enjoying my own music and audios!"
1,COBY CA-ee Power Adapter,"Could not get this product to work with the resource. It was advertised to provide flexibility, but I wound up throwing it away. IT would not plug in to my item for which I bought it. I don't even remember what I bought it for by this time."
1,Biased by Interest Rate Movements,"During most of the study period, interest rates have been on a steady and dramatic decline. This spelled rising bond prices and excellent returns for bonds. Thus the book looks in ""hind-sight"" for a method that is bound to work. Watch out!!"
2,"Sloppy, Hasty, and all too brief","The basic idea in this book (invest in bonds when they yield more than stocks) has been around for years; we should be grateful the idea was written-up in a way to attract attention -- but, as with other popular investing books of the moment (cf. Ken Lee's Trounce The Dow), there's an awful lot of filler and plenty of indications that literacy was not the editor's primary concern."
4,Lovin' it!,These are great fun! We love bringing these redneck families into our home. Always a great laugh!
1,Shortchanged,"I ordered 12 packs of 12 razors. I only received 1 package of 12 razors. I contacted Amazon and the seller. I have not received a credit nor additional razors. So, in essence, I paid $33.00 for a $3.00 pack of razors."
1,DO NOT BUY,This is definitely not as listed! I received one package of razors. Listing says 144 razors and all you get is one 12 count package. Do not waste your time buying these!
1,False Advertising,"You think you are ordering 12 packs of 12 razors because of the wording and what it says for the listing price and what your savings would be. They only send you one pack of 12. I have notified Amazon. I buy a lot from them, so I will be very disappointed if they don't correct this and will be shopping elsewhere."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"Robin Williams is the usual ball of energy with great impressions, rapid-fire jokes, and is definitely funny, but even having seen his stand-up in the past, I was shocked by how foul his language is in this performance. This is definitely an adults-only performance, but I have always considered gratuitous and constant profanity the domain of less-talented comics who can't make people laugh without swear words. I was disappointed to see a comic genius like Mr. Williams deliver such a performance. Luckily, we rented the disk--I would not wish to own this one."
1,Shockingly boring,"I like Robin Williams, but was thoroughly bored with this performance. His stand up routine was profanity laced, and all over the place."
3,Hold your applause please.,"I am a big fan of Robin Williams - his stand-up and movies. But this DVD was not up to his usual standards. It was from the early 90s, but I don't know how that would be detrimental. It just wasn't up to par. Sorry, Robin. But I'm still a fan."
5,Funny as hell,"Man Robin Williams funny as hell. I pissed my pants i was laughin so damn hard. This is a great dvd. It has an easter egg that shows every cuss word he says it is hilarious. He goes on about so many diffrent topics. Its crazy. Someone must have put something in that water, he went threw about 20 bottles of it. My favorite part was when he was doin the bit about drunk scots inventing golf. "" i wanna hit a ball in a gopher hole"" ""OH you mean like pool?"" ""Fu*k off pool! Not with a straight stick! With a little fu*ked up stick."" "" OH you mean like croquet?"" ""Fu*k croquet! Well put the ball hundreds of yards away. And well put tall grass and bushes just to fu*k with your ball. And at the end well put a flat spot with a flag just to give you hope. Then well put sand and bushes just to fu*k with your ball again!""In one word Id say this movie was Geniusly Awesome super terrificly pimped out. (OK i cheated a little)"
2,MORE WITTY TRASH TALK,"DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS OR FOR THOSE WHO GET DISGUSTED WITH THE REPEATED USAGE OF THE ""F"" WORD."
4,Non Stop Comic Romp,"Wow... I never knew that Robin Williams was so funny. When I think of Robin Williams, I think of Dead Poets Society.Williams shows why he's one of the best in the generation and the large variety of topics - ranging from world and national politics, the Catholic church scandal, the Winter Olympics, and being 50 is certainly beyond belief. Just watching Robin taking some hilarious shots at some key members of the Bush cabinet and of course, Bush himself are among the best ones delivered. Not a single breath is wasted on that stage. Every word is well thought out and even slip ups are taken in a direction that makes everyone laugh.If you like George Carlin, you'll love Robin Williams."
2,Disappointed,"I found this DVD quite tedious. It was a real dissapointment. I hope R.W. isn't reading this. If you normally do like Robin Williams' stuff (as I do) have a look at a guy from England called Ross Noble. Like Williams and Connolly, he has a sponatneous wild stand up routine.Here Williams just tried too hard."
2,Not very interesting,"This book was very hard to get into. As I read in another customer review, it was very much like textbook reading. I thought there was a lot of useful information for owners and managers of businesses, but it was not presented in a very interesting manner."
5,Excellent,Everything arrived as promised. I am REALLY enjoying thsi laundry detergent in my HE front loading machine! I was impressed that it contained Borax as I use that already since we have hard water (now I do not have to use laundry soap and Borax separately). :)
5,"Fantastic - light, slightly sweet and super creamy","This is the perfect balance of light, sweet and best of all subtle. I got a small bottle in a gift set for Christmas and absolutely loved it! I searched all over online post-holidays for more body wash and the accompanying lotion. Very bummed it's only seasonal but here's hoping it's out again next year! I'll be sure to stock up before the holidays!"
5,great shape,This was a gift for my father and he really enjoyed it and said it was in great shape for being used. He loves the series.
5,Every Cat's Survival Guide to Living with a Neurotic Owner,"My friend recommended this book to me. When it was not available in my local bookstore, I found it on Amazon through BayCityBooks. I bought a used copy, however, when it arrived (within the time stated), it looked brand new! I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had time to read it yet, but it is here waiting for me. The entire transaction was very pleasant and I would definitely purchase from this merchant again."
1,"Cute idea, horrible implimentation","This is a very cute idea, but I'm sad to say that nothing has changes in slot car design in the 30 years since I bought my last set. The tracks are too hard to snap together, and they break too easily. The cars have a nice heft, but it is near impossible to keep them on the track for a single lap, let alone enough laps for a race. I am aware that is part of the skill of using the system, but the controller isn't designed for that sort of nuance."
5,Good clear sound,"I bought this as a gift for a friend with only an old tape deck, he says his CDs come over crystal clear. Very pleased with it. Hasn't mentioned any problems with it automatically trying to change sides."
2,Takes great pictures but faulty software,"The Kodak EasyShare C643 6.1MP camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. The controls on the unit would sometimes lock-up/freeze after taking a picture and it was difficult to get it work properly again. To make the unit work properly again, one would have to power cycle the unit multiple times. I did not replace mine with another unit just in case I recieved one with the same problem. If Kodak makes it known this problem has been resolved, I would buy another one."
3,Fun watch,".... This is a bunch of stuff from different foreign films and one american - Lethal Seduction..I rented it cause it had Julie Strain in it and she's the queen of 'b'! The film has a lot of humor making fun of the sex scenes and has the cutest hostess, so petite, and sexy. If she works on her delivery she'll be a hot actress for genre films. The way the director and the editor put it all together kept me laughing and enjoying the night!..."
1,I've seen bettwer movies on America's funniest home videos.,"I think just about everyone has heard the name John Waters. It has become sysnonymous with tasteless shock. Multiple Maniacs is really no different.Understand, I'm the type of person who really enjoyed MEET THE FEEBLES. I like strange and disgusting movies. I went to this movie expecting it to be the classic I was told it was.This movie was not provocative. It was not shocking. It was not perverse. It was, in a word: stupid. I expect better from Waters. I expect better from a 12 year old spastic with hormone imbalance."
4,"Strange, demented black comedy.","I recently bought this film and I at first did not like it. I had seen Pink Flamingos before it and was expecting alot more out of it, even though it was one of John Waters' first. But, I watched it again, and I discovered I rather enjoyed it. Mind you, Its low-low-low-budget does show (hand- rolled film credits, no blanks for the guns,etc.) but they make the film even more enjoyable. Watch this movie!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"The looks are okay and options are simple enough, but The CD player broke after about a week when the CD quit spinning and the radio reception was pathetic from date of purchase. I don't think I will ever buy another GPX product. Total junk and disappointment."
3,An arcade game.,If you view this as a simple arcade time wasting game then it is ok. If you are looking for a serious game then it is not for you.You man the AA guns on a ship and shoot at attacking planes. At first they are easy then they start dodging more.It is unrealistic as the planes stay till they are shot down. You can shoot friendly ships they look like they are taking damage but it doesn't seem to matter.The graphics are a little old. Get the patch as it makes the graphics better.Other then that as I said it is an ok time wasting game.
3,GO GET WWII FIGHTERS,"Its an okay game.The graphics are okay, and the selection of aircraft is neat. But there are huge screw-ups. Even though Ive got a new Windows 2000 Pro with practically unlimited RAM and hard disk space, I have an extremely big problem with jerkiness(I think that the other reviewers didnt have big systems like me)although this is slightly helped by keeping the volume low. And its impossible to save campaigns, theres no AI skill level, and if you get below 1000 feet you literally get sucked into the ground. Also, for the gunsigts there is no dot in the center. Get WW2 Fighters. Its easy,fun,good graphics, and only [money] bucks."
1,Waste of $40,Jefferson T. Packer hit the nail right on the head! I can't even find anyone to play this dog online with. I did find 4 copies of WWII fighters on ebay!!!
4,Excellent book in classic mystery tradition,"Very cleverly constructed fair-play detective novel; reminded me of some of Ellery Queen's best. And DeAndrea has a talent for constructing engaging, appealing characters."
1,Watch the Velcro,"I am disappointment in the design of the case by 3com. The opening flap of the case opens from the inside, (side closes to your body) out with the male part of the Velcro on the flap. This causes my sweaters and shirts to snag and tear very time I open the case. Since case is not firm, when you sit or move in certain positions it activates the instant on selector buttons on the Palm V, draining the battery."
1,Cheap!,Product was scratched and finish was cheaply applied to cheap wood. Very disappointed as I love The Thristystone brand of coasters and have owned numerous sets. This holder is not worth the money to ship back. I borrowed a scratch remover marker to fill in all the areas that were knicked/scratched but it only made it look worse. Wish I had a fireplace. Good kindling?
3,Great quality,I received this broken at the base i was able to salvage the holder portion but the base was broke. customer service was quick with a refund. The quality is good and it complements well with my thirsty stone coasters.
3,Cute but too many errors,"Some chapters may be correct, but some have glaring errors. For example, it says a microscope has a concave and a convex lens. Maybe dissecting microscopes work like Galilean telescopes or maybe the first ones were did, but the main lenses in an ordinary compound microscope are both convex. An image formed by the objective is viewed through the eye piece. A concave lens does not ""gather light"". Later in this chapter she confuses single atom resolution and the size of a human hair.More than once she says that light traveling in straight lines is a particle property. The straightness of the lines is described by Maxwell's wave equations. Geometric optics includes no wave properties nor particle properties.As Schrodinger's cat is related, the radioactive sample is only one atom of Uranium. U235, the shorter lived natural isotope has a half life of 703,800,000 years, after which little evidence would remain of how long the cat lived."
3,Coyote's Canyon,"Gorgeous photographs taken in National Parks and other wild lands in the southwestern U.S. combine with New Age vignettes.I loved the photos, but found the narrative didn't appeal to me. One vignette stood out as disturbing: the narrator makes the mistake of telling a local that a mountain lion just ran across the road in front of the truck, and the local's response is to say he and his buddies will be out there the next day with dogs and guns. I found it sad to think that in the modern day people still have no better solution for living with predators than to exterminate them. Other than that -- I found the narrative generally sentimental and information-free, but it's just not my kind of thing and I'm sure it will appeal to others."
2,uninspiring introducion to a facinating language,This book describes Lisp from a function point of view. i.e. they subdivided the basic lisp functions in to categories and then dedicated a chapter for each category of functions.Not indepth to be a reference and not a very inspiring or original introduction to the language.I can do without it.
2,Not sure,"Not sure, I'd recommended this for someone unless you are flipping at California area.ThanksHobi"
4,Great Mid-life Crisis Book for Dreamers,My husband bought this book due to deal with his Mid-life Crisis desire to buy houses and fix them up to make money. He first got the book out of the library and then asked me to buy him a copy of it through Amazon.com. This is a positive sign that it is a good book because he is the type who will not purchase a book unless he really plans on referring to and using it. Too bad the economy took a turn for the worse but this does not change the fact that the book is interesting and full of enough helpful hints and ideas that he feels he eventually can pursue his dream. Better that than having an affair or buying a red Ferrari...
2,It's O.K. Not Exceptional tho for My Skin type,"I've tried so many different skin care products and find this Relastinto be O.K. but not what I was hoping for.....I need a lot of moisture and am alergic to a lot of products being fair and having rosacea. It doesn't irritate my skin but as far as helping it, I didn't see any difference using it.I just discovered Shea Butter and have found it much more moisturizingand does not irritate my skin as I thought it might."
1,Relastin Skin Revitalizer,The box of Relastin arrived in an unsealed box that was obviously old and the product inside had been used. Disgusting! I returned the item and was issued a refund. I would not recommend purchasing from this vendor.
3,"Good moisturizer, but reducing wrinkles?","Relastin promotes itself as restoring elastin to skin which reduces fine wrinkles and allows facial skin to ""bounce back."" Nice theory. I've been using it now for about 3 months. I find Relastin to be a wonderful moisturizer: long-lasting and non-greasy. But as for the reduction in fine lines...nada."
3,I question the sub-title,How could someone who took 40 years to make an 11 day journey possibly be the greatest manager of all time?
4,A good book - a good lesson about life too,"I had read only one book of J. Herbert before - Moon - and I didn't like it. But I gave him another chance, and I began reading Others... and, the book is very good! Altough he is previsible sometimes - differente from masters like Stephen King - sometimes he can grab you tight. The hero, a kind of ""freak"" detective, is a very detailed character, as the villain, Dr. Wisbeech. There are two amazing things - the end, that is incredible, and the moral ideas sometimes J. Herbert give to us. He make us think about love, humanity - not too much, only in brief moments, but is worth the reading. Enjoy!"
1,$17 shipping!,"I wanted to order this curtain, but then discovered that the shipping was more than the product!"
2,The problem that made me give-up.,"First let me say, I have no problems with the game as far as graphics, plot etc. What made me finally give up was a the fact that you could not just save anywhere within the game, as you can in Tomb Raider. The game only saves when you complete a level. If you die while trying to complete the level or simply have to stop before the level is complete, you have to start all over at the beginning of the level. ARRGH."
3,Flawed but OK for the price,"The fit and finish on this table are only fair. There are several gaps between the lower shelf and the legs. The finish is scratched in a few places on the top and there are many dings and knots in the wood.On the plus side, it assembles easily to a sturdy and functional table and for the price I think it is a good buy."
5,Excellent Buy!!!!,"Ordered this table for my living room. It arrived in just a few days in excellent condition. The color matched my other tables almost exactly. It was easy to assemble, no scratches on it,nice looking table. This table is an excellent purchase and the price was GREAT!!!!"
2,"Nice, but...",The item I bought to protect our new coffee table has actually ruined it!I like the look of these coasters and I bought them to protect our coffee table from water damage and the product description said it has a cork bottom to protect your furniture. But the cork bottom does not fully cover the bottom of the coaster and after the first use they have scratched our coffee table. Very disappointing.
2,Not Happy,Just got these coasters and I'm not pleased with the picture on them. The detail gets completely lost in the material used to make them. Looks like a blob of color rather than a picture.
5,A book for dog lovers,I realy like this book because a dog gets lost and I like the way the book describes the dog's feelings when he is lost and found. This book dosen't have much suspens but lots of action. The book is funny too! Every one will like it!
5,Classic 50's children's book is timeless,"Ribsy is one of Beverly Cleary's series on the children of Klikitat Street in Portland Oregon. It is pure 50's childhood and very entertaining. I use this as an independent reading selection for groups of my fourth grade ESL students. They can easily read it on their own, helping one another on the vocabulary, and they stay interested. All have asked to take it home to finish it. If you're a teacher who is looking to keep your class occupied while you hone in on students with learning problems, then let them read any of this series and they will let you work with your group for a half hour without interruption.If you're looking for a good gift for a child in 3d, 4th or 5th grade, this is one."
1,"Cheap knockoffs of the originals. Photos show original razor, not what you get.","The photo shows the real original BIC Advance razors. What they send you is totally different. You end up with a cheap looking knockoff.They also do not provide the same shave.Buyer BewareUpdate: have been using them for over a month now. They are as good or better than the originals. I guess bic thinks they improved them. They just look and feel cheaper now, but just shave just as good."
5,great metal thhunder,"Saxon's The Eagle Has Landed, is one of the great live heavy metal albums.It captures the band as hungry rising stars. The performances and sound are both great. You can feel the energy that must have been in the air that night. The set list is classic.Great Album!Buy it!"
5,Works Well,"I purchased this option for my daughter who is in the school band and has to travel with the instrument. This option works well; however, my daughter opted for the shoulder strap included with the bag after trying it. The backpack option was inexpensive since it was purchased in a bundle. Would still recommend it if a backpack option is desired."
5,Required for a trip to Nicaragua,This was an excellent book!!! Went on our first trip to Nicaragua and this book was invaluable!!! It is so well written that we read it cover to cover and is organized in such a manner as to make it very easy to find what you're looking for. Would highly recommend it!!!
3,Basic primer,"Very simplistic language makes this a good primer for parents new to special education. For those with some experience, I found this book to be too rudimentary. However, I will lend it to parents of children just diagnosed."
2,Just for nostalgia...,"Was very excited when I got this. Memories of when I was younger playing endless Atari games with friends and family, evenings full of fun and enjoyment. I had high hopes but alas my memories were a lot better than the experience of this unit. I was underwhelmed and somewhat deflated. It was really boring overall, Centiped was a good game but the rest were not as good as I recalled. Also I seemed to have issues playing on an LCD TV, had to revert to old CRT TV which it worked fine with. I only paid $5 of Craigslist for the unit so I don't feel too bad. If I spent $30 or more I would be upset. 2 out of 5 for the memories :-)"
5,the complete metallica story,this book was written by a real fan of metallica who tells it like it is he thinks most of the new stuff sucks but explains why he thinks they havent sold out they have just grown old and evolved this book has lots of rare pictures of old metallica and is worth buying for the large section on cliff burton with painstaking research on how they started and tons of hilarious storys never told before metallica may be old farts now but they forever changed rock music and no current metal band comes close to the complexity of metallicas old stuff if you want to know the full story and learn more about the amazing cliff burton buy this book it tells u about the entire early thrash metal scene and how metallica rose to the top of it
5,Indispensible,"As with their other book, Bridal Bargains, the Fields have created the ultimate detailed guide to the variety of baby products out there. Yes, they will save you money, by pointing out the shoddy brands and the unnecessary products, but the book's main value is in allowing parents to compare the quality and features of many brands, more that the two or three they might find at their local baby store. Prepared parents will be less likely to say later, ""if only we'd known..."""
5,must have!!,"If you're pregnant you HAVE to have this book! If you like saving money, or even just like to have a resource giving you information and opinions on brands, this is fantastic!!! The second one I've read, and I love hw the new ones have the websites too!!!! This is just as important as a good Dr. Sears book when you're expecting a new arrival! :)"
4,excellent cutters,My only complaint is the spring broke almost immediately. This didn't really affect my use of these very much but that is my only reason for not giving these a 5 star rating.
1,Did not like this,"When I got this product I was excited, then I tried it =P It says it is supposed to be liquid and mine is more like a gel. Then the label says ""great citrus flavor"" Mine tastes like a salt lick. Did not like the flavor or consistency. I would suggest trying something else."
3,"Less concentrated than others, but good price.","Not as much concentration as some of the other glucosamine products out there, but after talking to my vet, I was told that my dog wasn't absorbing all of it anyway, so this quantity is fine and I don't even have to change the dosage. I can't comment on the taste, but my dog doesn't seem to mind."
5,quick reference easy to understand,I happen to scan this book in a library and I fell in love with the trememndous insights contained in such a brief and concise outline.I would recommend this book for parents as well as as for Psych or Counseling students.
5,Hilarious!,"Wonderful, clean humor. I saw him in person and had to get this CD. He really keeps you laughing."
3,Interesting but flawed,"McColley succeeds in making us like some pretty unloveable characters by most standards, and creates a really cool ghost. The problem that I had with this story of a young man who joins Quantrill's Raiders is that I found the characters' reactions to be mostly unrealistic. Jacob, the main character, acts and feels in ways that makes no sense. Also, the end of the book was unnecessarily depressing -- I don't always object to sad endings but this was just sort of... flat. The Other Side certainly has its good points but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,I am feeling much love for my new keyboard!,"A bit of a pain to snap it in, and it's the same size as my Visor, but having a keyboard for my PDA has transformed it from something gathering dust in a corner to something I actually take to meetings!!"
4,Perfect addition to my PDA,"I absolutely love the wireless keyboard. It is the best investment I've made in awhile. I take it with me everywhere and it comes in handy. I don't have to play around with the little stylus anymore and I love it.I can type a letter, update my contact list, and send email with ease. The only problem I had was the size of the keys on the keyboard. The numbers are not exactly where a normal size keyboard dwould be. With a little patience I worked it out."
3,does NOT work with Visor Edge,"was saddened to learn upon opening this long awaited gift on my birthday that it works with Visor models EXCEPT for the visor edge, and Targus doesn't yet make an Edge model. trading slim size and slick-ness for functionality once again :("
4,Takes some getting used to,"I really enjoy the portability of this keyboard. At its reduced price, it was definitely worth the money and I wish I'd gotten it sooner! I agree with another reviewer that it would be much better if it had arrows because I do not see the point of having a start button when there are no arrows to maneuver through the menu and the cursor has to be moved across the entire screen. Other than that, the keyboard is a little smaller than a normal one which makes my fingers scrunch up a little and the infrared arm will sometimes move but it doesn't happen much and overall I really enjoy it! I would definitely recommend it to any student as a great affordable, more compact alternative to a laptop."
3,Good as long as it works,"My Targus Stowaway keyboard for Visor Deluxe seemed to have died over the weekend after eighteen months. Actually, it was an internal conflict within the Visor. I had added a jumper wire inside the Visor so I could charge from my hot synch. cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle.... My Stowaway keyboard worked just like before after making this modification. Then I downloaded Targus' lastest version of the driver for the keyboard. A couple of days later the keyboard was completely non-responsive. I have removed the jumper now. I later found the real problem was that my Visor was in its final stages of life. The keyboard does have a nasty habit of ceasing to communicate with my PDA. By experimentation, I learned that a soft reset followed by a warm reset got it going again. The keyboard works well when it works, but too often it does not. Again, this is probably more of a problem with the Visor than the keyboard."
3,"Decent Book, Many Errors","I found this book useful for practice before tests during the Calc year, however, many of the free response answers are absolutely wrong (negative sign suddenly appears in their solution when the original problem didn't have a negative sign, right endpoint calculations done incorrectly, etc.). Use it for studying, but the College Board's web site contains better study material for free response questions."
5,Absolutely Great!,"tpr is wonderful. To keep this review hackneyed, its so good, it can be used as a textbook. Thank you TPR!"
5,Swingball,I ordered the swingball for a church function. The kids loved it and even a few adults. The swingball was well made and alot of fun!We filled the base with sand to make it sturdy and it worked great. I would recommend buying this product especially considering thephysical activity it allows for children.
5,sweetness,this game is awsome. the gamplay is great and its incredibly fun to pour hot oil on people. if you want a game thatle last you at least 3 months then get this . (...)
1,dvd dud,"This dvd was blank. In other words, it didn't play, at all! I bought another one, new, and that played, except for the 15-minute shorter sequence, which was the reason I bought it, twice. Now, I check it out from the library when I want to do the short yoga routine."
1,Yet another failure to run,"This game is impossible to run on my system. All my other sim games from the original SimCity to the recent SIMS and expansions are fine, but NO GO with this game. It also mucks up my resolution after it freezes and boots to the desktop every time I try to run it.I've added the ""fixes"" but it doesn't help. The tech support doesn't respond and the HELP and message boards for this game on the Global Star website only leads to a series of ""404 Page not found"" pages."
1,Dont waste your money-or time!,"Okay, so put aside all of the ""not working"" stuff and you have a pretty crummy game. Right after you run out of money, the games over! Its hard to zoom in and when you do its scary! The people have no faces. The graphics are awful, so I could go on forever, but really , just don't buy it!"
3,"Fun, now that I can finally get it to run","I couldn't even get this game to run until I applied the latest patch, but now it's running fine.Not in the same league as Roller Coaster Tycoon, of course, but still a fun little sim."
4,Crime Stopper CS-610SI Power Door Lock Actuator,These actuators work very well but all actuators of this type (rack and electric motor type of actuation) are somewhat large and difficult to find space for inside a door. I could not use them for the size reason. I would never buy such an item again without having their overall dimensions first. Amazon should list the dimensions!!!
3,"Interesting, but not quite what I was looking for","I liked this book, but I guess I was looking for something more. I was hoping for a few more suggestions on how to be a successful working mother. The biggest thing that I took from this book are that there are advantages and disadvantages to every role that you can have as a mom. (Working mothers sometimes feel that they aren't parenting enough, stay at home moms sometimes feel isolated, and moms who work part time sometimes feel like they aren't doing either thing well).I thought that it was interesting, but I guess that it just reinforces that trying to balance work and family is something that still generates a lot more questions than it does answers."
1,"Good for young people, but less so for sophisticated readers","The writing of this novel is a bit flat-footed and the characters lack real dimension, but this would be a nice gift for a teeanger interested in finding out more about China history. Sometimes, historical events are more understandable when them come through the medium of fiction, and though Dream of the Walled City is prosaically written, it does provide a birds-eye view events in China of the last century. I wouldn't recommend it, however, to an adult with more sohisticated tastes."
3,Fleischman tried too hard to write a good story.,"I started this novel yesterday evening and decided to skim through the rest of it after one hour of intense reading. It utterly failed to engage me because I was constantly annoyed with the author's attempts to incorporate every possible life lesson at the end of each paragraph!!! While I applaud Fleischman's effort to bring forth another perspective of a China of the early 20th century, her prose does not flow smoothly and her plot tends to ignore the rules of a plausible timeline (e.g. her character ages eight years after two paragraphs!). As a result, her heroine, Jade Virtue, is disappointingly unconvincing as a possible historical figure. Overall, Fleischman should have spent more time tuning her plot than inserting superfluous adjectives into each sentence."
5,Great Service,Item arrived in perfect shape and in a very sturdy tube. Service was also very fast; it arrived sooner than I anticipated. Would order from them again.
5,Jazz Greats in one place,Man... what a powerful photo... so much talent in one place at 10:00am in the morning. Photo depicts life as it used to be. Have this framed on the wall in my game room and it adds the perfect touch.
5,Good transaction,Everything went just as you expect it to go although that's not always the case. I Would definitely make this purchase again.
1,Chatter...,Took a chance on these since the price was right and they got good reviews here. Put them on my 98 Chevy Tracker and they chattered...both sides. Tried to adjust the arms but the rubber is just too stiff. Took them off and purchased a pair of OEM for $20.
3,It's OK,it's reasonable product even though there is better one with a little more expensive.np problem at all with price I paid.
1,Very Biased,"Don't buy this book unless you are a Christian planning on converting. The authors really don't give a balanced view since the wife converted to Judiasm. A better title for the book would be ""The sooner you convert the better."" I would recommend books from Dovetail publishers if you want to be truly helped in this serious and emotionaly involved topic."
5,Hilarious!!,"This cd is one of the funniest I have heard in a long time. Mike Birbiglia's ""Two Drink Mike"" cd is well worth the money. My friends and I love this cd and find ourselves quoting it constantly. Check out this cd so that the next time someone says ""You'd be suprised"" you'll know what they are talking about :)Nathan"
3,Best in small doses.,"I came across Mike Birbiglia on XM's channel 151. I have to say that I've liked him better there--one bit at a time--than on this CD. He does have some really good material, and he works harder on his comedy than most, avoiding the easy, profane laughs. This CD is funny, and family friendly."
1,A fantastic drinks coaster but nothing more,"I thought that this would be a great mix of Urban Latino, salsa meets R&B.;How wrong I was.Awful CD - random music - a lot of it with no lyrics and no outstanding latino style - more a combination of random world music - fine if that's what you want, but not at all what it's name suggestst.Definately not worth buying."
3,Not about wine,"I was drawn to this book because its title indicated a link to wine and a promise that it would ""unravel the secrets of Montalcino's celebrated wine."" Of the 500 pages in the book, I found very little was dedicated to wine. I am an Italophile so I was not terribly disappointed with that fact. However, I found Dusi's book to be somewhat incomprehensible, filled to the point of over-distraction. At times, it is mind-numbing. For example, she provides far too many details about the local soccer team and her husband's particular obsession with it. The story line is not always consistent. It is not a terrible book, particularly if you love Italy. But, you will find yourself tempted to skip pages to speed up the story.If you are interested in Italy and do not mind reading a story that is not always consistent and that is filled with distracting details, you will find some pleasure with the glimpses Dusi provides into the life of the people of Montalcino."
1,"Well, I was Warned!","I am no financial genius, yet I've enjoyed books on the subject by several other authors, among them Michael Ridpath, however ""Conflicted,"" was truly a textbook. It gave all the facts, M'am, but I read for education AND enjoyment. There was no way I could enjoy the minutiae of every single task and moment in the offices of this screwed up environment. If true, as many of you who work in the industry attest, then I wonder how we are still afloat. I found the sexual behavior quite disgusting - mainly the whole trading floor cheering a scene on the roof of an adjoining building. So, all in all, this book taught me there are no morals, very little honestly, and ethics only when they must have them in the world of the traders.I should have read the comments before reading this stinker. To my credit, I skimmed ----- a lot."
1,"Boring, really boring","This book reads like some type of personal whitewash--research director good/investment bankers bad. The characters aren't developed and the plot is listless. Oh! the intricacies of the Institutional Investor poll. Who will win? Envelope please, I can't wait. Want to sleep on the beach this summer? Here's the ticket."
2,Disappointed,"It is a ten dollar knife. It doesn't matter if it's got the Kershaw name, it's a ten dollar knife. I bought this to replace a Rapala filet knife that was a piece of junk, wouldn't hold an edge and developed burrs all over the blade. I own a Kershaw skyline that is my EDC that I love. This knife is dull out of the box, the tip of the knife is laughably dull. If you are looking for a knife to cut through fish like butter, this is not your knife. If you are looking for a backup knife with an easy to clean sheath that you feel like spending 3 hours sharpening, this may be your knife. I can't speak on the quality of the steel or whether it will hold an edge (once you actually put one on it). The handle is nice, it feels very solid and well balanced in the hand. Out of the box, I would consider it unusable. May as well use a butter knife. Spend more money or you'll be wasting meat."
1,Read Amira Hass Instead!,"Agree with many reviewers here. There is something profoundly false in this book. Disagree that editing is what was needed. A deeper understanding of the Palestinian people is sorely lacking and ditto: I found the Israeli soldier's musings purely farsical. If you want to know what the Palestinians endure, read Amira Hass' beautiful ""Drinking the Sea at Gaza"", though it isn't fiction, it might as well be. Read Rubber Bullets by Yarom Ezrahi, or Coming Home to Jerusalem, or Avi Shlaim.. This book is using and abusing a terrible situation, not adding to its emotional truth with imagination, but detracting from that, as the non-fiction books mentioned do not. Now, this is a leap: but why a twenty year old photo? And why such a totally dismal cover, one that is discordant with text. Everything about this book, including that I bought it, bothers me. I just take the Middle East too seriously to bear this tripe. Seriously, Read AMIRA HASS; she's the Giant in this pond of writers."
5,Great batteries with a value price!,"These batteries offer a good amount of time for using portable CD players or anything else that requires the use of AA batteries. The price is right since many ""convenience"" stores charge up to 50 cents for just one of these batteries. They rarely corrode as they are sold with a very long expiration date (several years). I recommend them for any device that requires the use of AA batteries. Keep spares on hand!The batteries are also clearly marked so you know which end is ""positive"" and which end is ""negative."" A very good product!"
2,Not what I expected,"After reading all the reviews about this tv I decided to go ahead and purchase one. The first one was very much out of alignment. The company I bought it from (800.com) exchanged it for another one. This one is alot better but it is still not the quality I expected and the picture alignment is still off. Top write corner drops off, the top center has a dip in it, centering is off, etc. I've decided to go ahead and spend the money and try a sony. I'll let you readers know."
5,Goes perfect with the Thirstystone Sandstone Coasters,"I bought this coaster holder to go with the Fleur De Lis Thirstystone Sandstone Coasters, and they fit great. Some reviews noted that only 3 coasters fit, but mine fit all 4 snug enough that they are just slightly angled. I like the scroll design, very nice."
2,Read the first 300 pages,"The first half of this book is an interesting history of California labor and radical politics - stuff they don't teach in school, but as the timeline moves towards WWII the book degenerates into a rant about the California Communist Party. The author has a passionate distate for Harry Bridges that colors much of the subsequent discussion. I also have to say that some of the ""facts"" presented are tenuous, especially for a journalist. Information about Oppenheimer is controversial at best, and he seems to use some facts out of context to advance the vehement anti-CP line.I should note that I read this book in Paris which made me laugh out loud about some the claims the author makes about the importance of California radicals on world politics and intellectual history. In the end, I wish this was a 300 page book stripped of most of the author's more outrageous opinions and presented as a good history that is seldom read."
3,As someone who has made below B grade horror movies before.,"They did a rather good job on an obviously low budget, which is always impressive to me. They sometimes break the 4th wall, which is difficult to do without taking all credibility away from your ability to be a film maker. However, Psychos in Love pulls it off, even to the point of being funny at times.If you're a true fan of B and sub-B horror flicks, you'll enjoy this. It's very much worth your time. Don't expect for it to go over well with just regular horror fans. First, it's more of a comedy than anything else. Secondly, they're just regular horror fans for a reason. It's by no means a ""thinker"" but it does require an appreciation for the craft of low budget movie making all the way through."
3,Swedish mystery,"It's been over a year since I read this so it's not fresh in my head. This book was entertaining and the first book I had read that was set in Sweden, giving it a little something extra. I don't recall too much about the main character which probably means she wasn't that impressive. This is probably a good book if you just want a fun read/thriller. It's not really a keeper."
4,An important biography that fills a void,"This is a professionally researched and written biography, and an important contribution to the political scene. Perhaps its only flaw is to focus a little heavily on the vice president's political expediency. But in light of the pass that is often given to Al Gore's questionable biographical summary by other media outlets, this book helps balance the scales."
3,"A partisan, but asurprisingly worthy, biography","There is little question about the author's feelings in this book. He obviously doesn't like Al Gore. But the fact that Mr. Zelnick is so candid about his partisanship is refreshing. He doesn't pretend to be objective. And there is actually a lot of interesting information contained within it. This is by no means the ""definitive"" biography of the vice-president but I think that it contributes well to the political dialogue. A good read if you appreciate it's limitations."
2,Vendictive and Gossipy,"This books goes into great details of Al Gore, Sr., and Jr. even to the point of being boring. It reads a little too much like a vendetta against both Gores, and seems a little bit too gossipy. Yes, some of the information given is surprising, but I question the motive for this book at all.I would like to see a book on George Bush, Jr. that goes into such great detail."
5,Awesome Book,"Very interesting & well done book on circus performers, i.e. aerialists, acrobats & trapeze artists."
3,Review Sceptre X9WG-Naga,"For the price I paid it is a good product.The colors look a little fadded and every thing seems to be too wide.I have been trying to adjusted that but had no success.But since I will go with a lap top in a couple years this monitor suits me just fine for now.You get what you pay for,I guess."
1,Trivial and not very sexy,"I love Carol Queen so I bought this, but, blah, not much to it. Lots of trivial, forced writing, a few good stories, none of it worth the effort. Jamie Gatto and Mary Ann Monaraj have to be two of the most overrated ""erotica"" writers around, and there's a few others in here working hard to join them. Maybe bisexuality just isn't that interesting as a theme, yet I just finished Cara Bruce's ""best bisexual"" book and thought it was very good."
3,Not bad...,"Once again Tanenbaum brings back his characters shaping this book into a legal thriller.While I always enjoy this author's work, I can never quite get over the feeling that I am reading short stories instead of one novel. It always seems that Marlene, Butch and Lucy are all living out their lives separately and that although the stories do cross over, are never really intertwined properly.This last novel is no exception to this. While I admire Tanenbaum's attitude of ""strong women - no victims"" approach in all his books, I never get the feeling that the characters complete themselves.Nonetheless, a good read and of course, as always, the somewhat ""dry humor"" is always great."
4,Really liked it,"I really liked this book though the mysteries were more or less open and shut, it was how people thought of them, moralized through them. Lucy, the daughter comes off as a bit incredible, in her talents and religious convictions but it's a nice addition. The concept that a teenager is thinking deeply on the Universe was a welcome change. I would definitely keep my eyes open for another book about this family."
1,Disappointing,"This product arrived late due to address conflicts. When it arrvied, it was in unacceptable condition. Knicks and scratches were visible on the product and the sound quality was less than desirable. However, when I voiced my concerns about this product to the company, they promptly refunded my money. Very gracious about it."
5,The only book you'll need on Wahhabism,"A complete historical overview of Wahhabism, this book should be enough for anyone interested in this deviant branch of Islam. I'm surprised that so few works exist on this all-too-critical subject, and I'm afraid that after this book, no one will need to write another. Written in his usual engaging style, carefully researched and expounded in detail, Dr. Hamid Algar's book is a must for the library of anyone interested in understanding Wahhabis and the political movements associated with them (the Taliban would be the most glaring example). I would also recommend his other fine works, particularly the classic ""Islam and Revolution"" (if you're fortunate enough to find a copy of this gem, buy it without hesitating)."
2,Too flimsy.,I found it was lacking in strength. as well as not holding many stuffed animals. If you only have a couple stuffed animals and small at that maybe this would work. However for my grandbaby was not the right item. as for shipping I would give five stars as well as packaging.
3,Arado Ar 240 Luftwaffe Profile Series #8,"First book I've ever seen on this subject. It doesn't take long to get through the 24 pages. Good 4-view color profiles and a comprehensive spec charts.If there would have been more pages and photos, the book could have received 4 stars. The author did a great job with what was available."
1,not a good device,"This device is just a strap. You cannot control the resistance and it has simply no effect. Even if you do Isometrics, you have to have a control of your strength. There are much better devices, like the Bullworker or the Isokinator. You need to change the resistance."
4,"Fading, But Still Fabulous Francescatti","I have written many reviews of Zino Francescatti's recordings and thoroughly enjoy this violinist; I have commented in the past that one of my greatest bargain purchases was orderingZino Francescatti: Great Violin Concertos: Mendelssohn / Bruch / Saint-Saens / Tchaikovsky / Prokofiev / Chaussonfrom the Columbia House sale catalog for two bucks! However, by 1972 when these Bach Concertos were produced, he was obviously in the twilight of his career. Fortunately, it is Bach and a virtuoso performance isn't required for listening enjoyment. Much like the disc's cover, this is Zino at sunset, but it is a glorious sunset nonetheless. Rudolf Baumgartner leads the Festival Strings Lucerne on these accounts of BWV 1041-43, with Regis Pasquier as the second violinist on the 1043. This DG ""Resonance"" disc has been out-of-print for a decade, but inexpensive used copies abound in the Marketplace, so interested parties should be able to find one easily enough."
2,Works but insanely overpriced,"I've dealt with other fluke products before and they are usually well built, sturdy and seem like quality products which somewhat justifies the high price. I was hoping this would fall into the same category since it was pretty pricey when most products do the same thing for 1/3rd the price. Unfortunately I was left extremely disappointed.My initial impressions were that the packaging was good, the documentation seemed decent but the actual micromapper was a very cheaply made plastic unit. Sure the thing seems to work well, but it couldn't have cost fluke more than a few dollars to manufacture. If I shake the unit it rattles because there are loose components inside. I would also be wary of dropping this, as it will likely break immediately.This unit gets two stars because it works well and does what its supposed to. However, based on the high price and extremely low build quality I can't recommend this unit when I've used others that were just as good but far cheaper."
4,concise resource,"When you're ten years out of school, and you still reach for a book you used in college, you know its valuable. I reach for Bube as a refresher very frequently. Its not flowery, but it has just enough figures and just enough math and explanation to cover most electronic phenomena. Photoemission, field emission, photoelectric effects, schottky barriers, etc. are covered well enough so that you can tackle a calculation of a particular phenomenon when necessary."
4,Faith and Politics Review,"Author provides a valuable insight into what is not working well in United States Politics. He provides a good non-partisan approach to how politics works (or doesn't work) and directs us to think about correcting a ""broken system.""Nice approach and well worth reading."
3,Good Premise,"This book has a solid premise for moderate Christians to take a stand, without arrogance, and proclaim that the religious Right does not speak for all Christians and may revive the old bumper sticker ""The Moral Majority is Neither"". He calls the reasonable Christian to be a peacemaker and return to the humility of the Gospels. He presents a personal view and not an official stance for any organization and does not pretend to propose a theological treatise. The book reflects his experience and becomes somewhat diluted by many personal stories that feel like they were added for filler."
2,Simple view of a difficult moral debate.,This is a simple view from a politican's perspective about religion and morals in American politics. It is an easy read with no clear recommendations as to what needs to happen. It is a good start without any follow through....I did say it was written by a politican.
2,Exasperating experience,"I have never returned a book for a refund. Until now. And that's a shame, because David Long is a master of the English language. Technically, his writing is brilliant - and that's what the two stars are for. The problem with ""Daughters"" is that we are led down a meandering road full of broken promises. I won't recount the story, as that's been done. Suffice to say, after an intriguing prologue and even more mysterious and fascinating opening chapter, this book devolves into a series of endless, exasperating phone and email monologues. At one stretch, a single email drags on for 30 consecutive pages and offers nothing to advance the story but plenty of frustrate the reader. Any so-called resolution to the mystery is an out-of-left-field theory involving a tiny character who emerges through another tiny character's recollections in the last fifty pages. The middle third of this book could have been dropped. This is a novella at most and a short story at best."
2,"I wanted to like it, but found myself scanning for something","interesting, and there are just too many books in the world to waste time on one that doesn't float your boat. The idea of the story was interesting, but I just couldn't care about the characters. Like most books you either love it or hate it. My advice is read the first few chapters before you plunk your money down. Or better yet get it from the library."
4,Don't confuse this with a mystery,"I read some of the on-line reviews, and it's clear some thought this was a mystery. It's not -- it's a novel about a mysterious disappearance. [There is a difference] What made it such a good read is how deeply you learn to know the characters, even as they evolve through the book.Compelling. And a page-turner most of the time."
4,BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN TALE,"As an avid and varied reader sometimes I take a chance on an author I have not tried before. In Elizabeth Richards case I am so happy I did. Her protaganist, Paige, is a 40 year old woman struggling with infertility, loss, a stepson, and a band of ""littles"" that she babysits. The interactions of these characters are unique; offsetting; slightly eccentric.(much like Anne Tyler offers) The dialogue is realistic and crisp. I experienced a myriad of emotion along with the characters, always a sign of a well written story. I look forward to purchasing, ""Every Day"" as this author shows strong promise."
5,Great TV and a competitive price,I shopped around awhile before buying this TV and this is a great deal. It has a bundle of features that you would normally pay a lot for. Picture is outstanding. Bass could be better but what TV couldn't need more bass. Just an overall great buy!
5,so far so good,I've been using this blade for three months and so far i'm very pleased. Performs amoung the best blades i've owned.
5,Your kids will love it!!!,"I got this video for my 5-year old niece and 2-year old nephew, and they LOVED it! I have never seen these two kids stop what they were doing, sit-down and watch anything for more then 5 minutes, but with this video they did. The music is very calming, and the underwater scenery is just beautiful. The kids loved all the fish, especially the clown fish because it reminded them of Nemo. And now my niece wants to know everything there is to know about every fish. I think this would even be a great video to put on right before naptime. I would highly recommend it as a fun addition to the traditional cartoon videos available for kids. Well done!!"
2,A Creaking Plot,"The author gets a lot of his law right, but then wants us to believe that the DA does his own investigating, even doing a little b&e on the side. Too much to buy."
2,not really,This story had potential but I just could never believe in the characters or the plot. In a nutshell it's just not plausible. I was disappointed.
4,Good Value,"Yes, you can spend more, but for a few bucks, these work fine. You're going to change wiper blades every few months anyway. I don't care if you spend $20 per balde on the promise it will last longer; the truth is, you're going to change it sooner than you think. So, for $5 or so, these do just as good a job, and I can chagne them more often for less overall cost. They are quiter (no chattering across the windhsield) than the higher priced Michelin I had before. Until I find something better, I will keep buying these. Good value for the money."
5,Great Price for great product,"There are some products you get what you pay for or less than what you paid for... This one is neither of those: it gives you more. Displaces water efficiently, gets job done. Will update."
5,This wiper wipes well,"I especially like how this wiper wipes precipitation off of my windshield. It uses squeegee-like action to squeegee moisture off of my windshield so I can see when it rains or snows. Plus, I like that this product was 50% less then some other wipers that also wipe precipitation off windshields."
3,"Dirty, sexy and rotten.",One of the best novels I have read. Clearly I will read more Bukouski. Factotum makes you feel rotten and inspired at the same time.
5,works great in a 2007 corolla LE,"old oem toyota belt was squeeking on morning starts until warm up. replaced at 58K miles. the goodyear gatorback belt has been great and quiet so far. takes about 20 minutes. to install, jack the passenger side front up. remove the wheel. remove the side wheel well liner. use a 19mm to loosen the tension. note belt placement on pulleys. take off old belt. work in reverse from here."
3,OK but nothing new.,"This book was interesting but did not contain much that I had not already read. At times I felt as though I were reading ""Beyond Prozac"". It basically recommends taking amino acids and fish oils, getting lots of light and doing some exercise. It also discusses many vitamins and minerals and their relationship to depression.A good ""starter"" book on natural treatments for depression but not very helpful if you've already done a little research of your own."
5,Great Product,Great Product if you have a back injury. Would recommend this video if you don't have experience with Pilates.
4,Bigfoot Exists In This Movie!,"Good quality from Amazon, the movie was okay but didn't have enough bigfoot in it!! Chelsea Hobbs is a good actress and the reason I bought the movie in the first place."
2,Pay a little more,"While the blade assembly is easy enough to install - the blades themselves are terrible - they squeak like dying mice. I thought after 6 months it might stop after being worn in a little - but no. Bottom line, money wasted as I have to replace them - just can't stand the noise when it rains. Spend a little more on some better blades."
4,Good wiper but bad experience,"This is a good wiper blade with bad, bendable packaging. The 1st order with 2 wipers had one broken plastic end and was unusable. I returned the item for a replacement. The replacement came today. The box had already been opened and the blade was bent in the center. The pin for the mount was missing. Having been through returning the 1st blade I decided that this one was salvageable with a plier bend and a bolt with Loctite to replace the missing pin. When I went to mount it, the mount was too small. The only other mount was too large. The standard mount was missing. I believe that I was sent a wiper that was returned as damaged by another customer. Until Amazon can supply an undamaged wiper, buy elsewhere.Update: The third time is a charm. I just received another replacement in pristine condition, sent overnight UPS. This time a smaller, more rigid box was used. Amazon's return policy is excellent. They shipped to me free and reimbursed me for the returns."
2,Not water resistant,"Well, it certainly isn't ""weather resistant"", I used it in the rain and it is now fogged inside. I would not buy this monocular again"
1,Very Unreliable and Extremely Short Flight Time,"I agree with the two reviewers who came before me. I bought this plane about 2 months ago (from an eBay merchant). The first plane sent to me would not charge. After paying for the additional cost of shipping the product back to the merchant, I got a replacement plane that would charge and would fly for about 30 seconds per charge. However, on a turn, one of the two props needs to slow down and the plane would nose dive into the ground. The plane was just too heavy for the output power of the props. Don't buy this plane. Buy the one made by Silverlit. Silverlit makes a plane that looks almost identical to this plane but works a whole lot better."
5,Pure originality,"The pixies are the MOST underrated band . . .EVER. I realize that their popularity has grown since their break up, but when the best band of the 90's (nirvana) says that you're their greatest influence, you're doing something right. Every song on this CD throws so many different ideas at you in usually less than 3 minutes. That's impressive. Also, the songs are so diverse that it never gets borring . From the edgy break my body to the poppy gigantic, which is the best song on the cd IMO it's all pure orriginality in the best form humanly possible. I heart the pixies. They are definately a band that is an aquired taste, considering i completely hated them for the first 3 months i had their cds, now their my favs."
4,you're so pretty when you're faithfull to me,"What amazes me the most is the fact that Frank Black seemed to have no idea how to sing when this album was made, but he does it. This is punk rock in the best way : new and exciting and different. Emotional and LOUD."
3,"Not so much a review of the album, but the SACD...",I've recently become more interested in the SACD format since purchasing a ps3. I have a couple Peter Gabriel SACD's -- which sound awesome. But this particular SACD is a real disappointment because it's only 2 channel. Yes it's remastered and if you don't mind it being in plain ol' stereo it does sound superior to the regular issue on cd.I was really hoping to listen to this in 5.1 -- it's a great album and I was betting it would sound tremendous in surround.
1,This Item only works about 1 out of 5 cast,"Only works about 1 out of 5 cast if that good. Dont waste your money, I found this to be useless. I bought to try and catfish on bottom with a float, half the time you never make it to bottom, and the float dont stand up. Good Idea but just does not work."
3,"Book, Financial Acct, Used","Disappointed with the comments from the seller, believed to be unused new, actually previously used with writing in it. Will buy new next time from a seller with a proven track record."
4,Great Resource,"I ordered this book out of curiosity and became a fan instantly! The book talks about the importance of certain vitamins, minerals, and supplements along with and their ideal dosages for maximum benefits. The author does an excellent job of summarizing complex topics into entertaining and interesting sections that are sure to please. Though this book may not be as updated as I and many others would have liked, it provided a wealth of information that I have applied to my everyday life. As a graduate student, I feel my brain and overall health have improved a great deal and find myself in a better mood and with more energy. I find myself calmer when learning new things with an increased short-term memory that continues to surprise those that know me well. I cannot wait to compare myself many months from now and see how far my progress has come. This book is a blessing and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for natural ways to boost their cerebral abilities."
4,Great book!,"I loved it. It had great romance, great sex scenes and great action. I loved the Alpha Male in this story, he was so caring and so comforting towards his lady love. This is definitely a book that I will add to my collection. I loved it!"
3,Alot more romance than story line,"To put this bluntly, this book is filled with sex and then some suspense. There is no climactic reveal, no mystery to figure out, no emotional breakthrough or touching story. It just is what it is. I know that seems vague and cruel, but it was missing friction between the main characters and the pull that has the reader routing for them.This was my first Lucy Monroe book, and I haven't quite debated whether I will read anymore or not. Not worth the money in my opinion."
4,"Enjoyable, fast paced, fun...","This was my first book by Lucy Monroe and I almost didn't bother because of some of the mixed reviews. As another reviewer mentioned, if you are a Shannon McKenna fan then you will probably enjoy this book. I found it hard to put down. The characters were very likeable, and the plot was suspenseful enough to keep me turning pages without being over the top. I have already ordered ""Willing"" & ""and Able"" because I can't wait to find out what happens to Nitro and Hotwire. I have to admit that Nitro didn't draw me as much as Hotwire did so I'm interested to see if I'll like ""Willing"" as much as I enjoyed ""Ready"" but judging by the reviews others seem to like it better then the final installment ""and Able"" featuring Hotwire. All in all if you like the strong, slightly dominant alpha male heros then I think you'll like this book."
2,Buy a whole size larger than you think,I bought a 9 1/2 size Men shoes and they were to tight. So I ordered a size above and received a 10 1/2 shoe which was still to tight. I'll see if they stretch a little.
2,A collection of Sally Quinn's name-dropping stories,"The title of this book implies that it's a how-to-guide to throwing a great party. You do get a few tips here and there, but this book serves mainly for Sally Quinn to name drop, describe the fun parties she's hosted, and generally tell you how terrific she is. Sally Quinn was the style editor for the Washington Post; her husband is Ben Bradlee, the famous Washington Post editor during Watergate, the Pentagon Papers and a number of other significant historical events. The tone of this book is lighthearted, and many of the stories are quite funny. After a while, though, I got tired of reading about ""when Hillary and Bill came over one time,"" or ""when all these Senators and Representatives were at our house,"" or ""when we hosted this fabulous dinner party and everyone in Washington was talking about it for weeks."" The tone of this book was too self-congratulatory for me to fully enjoy it."
3,Not the same size as my original,"Admittedly my DLC-7 is a bit old, around 1980. Apparently the bowl has been redesigned to about 1/64"" smaller than the original. Additionally there is a new tab interlock that prevents the bowl from fitting the top without modification. I'm pretty handy, so I cut off the tab and carefully filed the interior until the cover would turn without too much difficulty. If you've got an older model like mine, you'll have to cut the tab off for it to work at all, or buy a new top as well."
2,Mediocre conducting spoils this,"Great sound and great playing but the conducting leaves much to be desired. Jarvi speeds through the high intensity passages as if he's got a plane to catch thus missing much of the tension and excitement. The first movement comes off best, the rest not so much. Comparing this performance to the Rostropovich LSO performance, I want to throw this CD away."
5,Thumbs up!,"Was getting my size n batteries from radio shack for years. They never lasted very long and was constantly going back for more. Could never find duracell in the stores,so found them on here and am very satisfied. Much better thank you!"
5,A Great Time and Money Investment,"This book provides a wealth of information about ethnomusicology's history, central questions, its approach to an ever-changing (musical) world, and its role in academia. Bruno Nettl presents the facts about ethnomusicology -based on his own experience and past/present literature- in a non-bias manner, and he leaves it up to the reader to draw his/her own conclusions and questions. the author's written style is simple, engaging, and, while it has a somewhat academic feel to it, it invites the reader to participate in the ""discussion."" Without a doubt, this book is a must-read for anybody, especially for those who wish to better understand the field of ethnomusicology, its past, its present, its future, and the role that it plays in the study of Western and non-Western musics."
2,CDR Abrashoff misses the boat ...,"If you read Commander Abrashoff's first book, save yourself some time -- skip this one. My own experience as a Navy officer made the Commander's first book uniquely appealing. If I had served under a commanding officer like him, I would still be in uniform.Instead showcasing new leaders and new ideas, every chapter of the sequel informs us how the subject of the story brilliantly implemented the Commander's ideas - and giving us a new story or two about HIS ship to prove it. Instead of a cast of inspiring lead characters, the ""Great Leaders"" of the title are reduced to minor supporting roles.While his first book gave a memorable presentation of management and leadership ideas, he didn't invent them. I have read the same principles in various forms in dozens of other books and articles over the years. Commander Abrashoff missed an opportunity to make waves with these tales, instead sailing back through the same waters that he covered before."
5,"Easy to learn, learned after two times watching","Tom silver is a very good teacher in hypnosis. The technique is stressed within the video and is very easy to apply. ""Instant"" inductions do work and it just takes the confidence and a little bit of prep to really bring it home. I was able to learn these simple rapid and instand/shock inductions it just two viewings of the video. Good video well done."
4,Sweet Dreams,I was looking for a headset that I could wear at night to go to sleep to music. I like the one sided cord and the slim design of the ear pads. This has satisfied my needs although Philips had an older model (apparently no longer available) that was even a slimmer design.
4,Cheap at twice the price,You will not find a better coffee maker at double the price. Check out the wattage on any other coffee maker under $100 and none come close to the 1450 watts in this little baby. Wattage is essential to bring the water to the ideal temperature of 200 degrees F - and it does it quickly! This coffee maker would have easily warranted a 5 star rating except that they only last about two years. This may be my fault since I brew two cups at a time and the recommended minimum is 4 cups. I am on my third one and will buy another when this one dies.
2,Not a lasting product .,"I bought my coffee pot last November 2003 and it's dead already!The electronics display shuts down during brew cycles,and will not restart."
5,Excellent!,"This is inarguably the best book on straight ODBC API. Very lucid in its presentation and full of practical examples, every page is packed with all the essential information. This is really a serious book for the serious ODBC programmers and every tool and technique to get the job done can be found in this book. My only wish is that the authors would update this book from ODBC v2.0 to v3.0, perhaps also include a few chapters on OLEDB."
2,Nodding off,"I found myself becoming extremely sleepy while reading this book. Scott Frank's constant state of heroin-induced ennui, combined with his complete lack of humor, made for a very soporific read. An exception to this is his tale of transporting heroin across the Mexican border and his subsequent encounter with a good-ol'-boy customs guard, who, after inspecting the tracks on Scott's arms, decides to let him go anyway. A palpable sense of self-absorption emanates from his writings. It works pretty well as a period piece of the late seventies heroin scene. Recommended for those who really, really like to read about heroin."
5,"Overall, a terrific set of multi-part episodes.","I have both the two sets of ""Justice League"" and the two sets of ""Justice League - Unlimited"", and of the four, I think the first ""Justice League"" is my favorite, with the three-part ""The Savage Time"" being my favorite episode.However, as much as I like ""The Savage Time"", there are some glaring historical inaccuracies and technological improbabilities/impossibilities that are hard to overlook without some effort. Still, it's a fun watch."
2,Aquaman Revises and Failed Again,"Not one of JL's better episodes. Once again, DC tries to reinvent Aquaman - and fails. The brooding and ""surface hating"" king of Atlantis comes under attack by one of his own government officials, and ends up sacrificing a hand to save his infant son. All the while, he's busy being snarky with the Justice League and even mouthing off at Batman. Big mistake, as any fan. DC did indeed move on quite well, only ruining a few more episodes by having Aquaman appear to wreck them as well. My advice - skip this episode (and others such as ""Wake the Dead"") and enjoy the others, up into JLU."
4,Good start,"Everybody had been waiting for this series since the Batman and Superman animated series. And they started off pretty good. Unfortunately, Bruce Timm even admitted the weak points. Batman and Superman were received well right out of the starting gate, while it wasn't until Season 2 of Justice League that they got it right. But it's a harder show. The action has to be bigger. And you have seven principal characters to juggle all with distinct personalities.All in all, though, great show. Good season. And it only gets better after this."
4,Super Friends? We don't need no stinking Super Friends!,"When I was a kid, I loved the Super Friends, primarily because it was really my only shot at seeing the Justice League on TV. Of course, the Super Friends were sort of JLA-lite--with the exceptions of the episodes featuring the Legion of Doom and Darkseid and his minions. This series from Bruce Timm (of Batman: The Animated Series) and company brings the spirit of the comics to the TV screen, and while there were some missteps in this first season, it was a sign of really, really good things to come."
2,What happened to the English Subtitles????????!!!!!!,"Now I've waited a long time for the whole series to be out on DVD, not just random episodes. And if they can manage to put English language subtitles on the 3 episode disks, how the heck can they screw up so badly on the season 1 dvds? I purchased this dvd series twice to make sure I wasn't just crazy, I looked everywhere online to see if I was the only one experiencing this problem and guess what, its a problem with the sets. Every website and the back of the box itself lists that the season comes with subtitles in English and yet the option isn't available anywhere on any of the 4 disks. I've email the WB every day since 3/21 when the set came out and no response at all. And the only phone # available to call is to the WB shop, who after 5 days of speaking to 5 different people, can't do anything about the product. WOW what a company."
2,Not for a Standard TV with a PS3,"I love Justice League. So I began to collect the whole series and decide to initiate with this release.In my case (I have a 36"" standard TV with a PS3) the extra cost wasn't worth it.First of all I get a square letter box, I mean that in my TV it doesn't display in a real full screen, although it should. So, all that I see is an image in the center of the screen about 3"" smaller that it should be.The sound isn't impressive either. As other review stated: most use of the center and a few of the whole rest of speakers.Not really special features.For me, this is an average DVD and not worth the extra cost. Stick to the DVD and avoid the BD. That's a shame, because I love this series."
4,Really like this,"I only heard one cut from this Cd before I purchased it. I love the song Beautiful in my eyes. I took a chance on the advice of another review that I had read. It said ""every song on this Cd is as good as the next"". After purchasing this Cd and hearing every song I strongly agree that it is an excellent album. Check it out, you won't be sorry."
5,Jan's Albums are wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Jan is a phenomenal flute player. I have seen her live and have both of her albums. Just set her CD's to play and go about your day. It will bring you peace and calmness that you have never experienced before!!!!!!
5,A Funny Wounderful book!,When I was little my dad read this book to me some of the things i didn't get but after he told me the scoup i got it (and learned somthing new too).I don't know what happened to that book but i want to get it for my little sister.
3,Fizzled out early on,"Sharon Driver and her husband, Heath, adopted a daughter, Katie, 15 years ago and 3 years ago Sharon gave birth to a son, Liam. Now Katie's birth mother, Georgette, is looking for her, and the woman ain't right.Sharon is put upon, Heath is a philanderer, Liam is adorable, and Katie is troubled by teenage angst. The storyline builds around Georgette's insinuation into the Driver family. She spends big bucks and stacks up some bodies in her quest to reclaim her daughter, but it's all fairly predictable and never really builds up a full head of steam. There's lots of sex, most of it of the male fantasy variety. As a thriller, it simply fell somewhat short."
2,Canon TC8on3 Battery eater,This thing has no way to cut off the pouwer to save the battery I can not beleve Cannon would make something so cheap and sale it for this price . It is canon made with canons name . I have two canon camras and seeing some thing like this makes me want to sale them both . To trun it off you must remoive the Battery every time ( is this a Joke )
1,Amazon selling USED as NEW!,Don't bother buying one of these from Amazon - they are selling USED as NEW!The one I ordered came with a scratched screen and connector.Thanks Amazon - another order going to NewEgg.
2,THIS REMOTE DOES NOT FIT THE CANON 60D,"I carefully looked for a quality remote which would be compatible with the 60D, and selected this one, only to discover the plastic 3-prong male plug was built for the 7D.The 60D remote jack requires a small metal male end (like a headphone jack). The remote may be of great quality, but IT DOESN'T FIT THE 60D, LIKE IT SAYS IT DOES, unless they mean a Nikon D60 or something.FIX YOUR DESCRIPTION, PLEASE.Thank you, that is all."
3,Remote arrived with NO BATTERY!,"This is not the level of product packaging that I had come to expect from Canon. Now I get to track down a CR2032 battery to see if the thing even works. Very unimpressive, Canon."
1,another international warranty,Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit.
1,received a grey market remote,The remote i received was a grey market remote. Returned it and bought it from another retailer.
4,Good Movie For American/Japanese Little League Fan!,"The Bad News Bears go to Japan is the third and final movie of the series! If your a little league baseball/underdog rooting fan, then this movie is for you! Its humor and understanding of Japanese culture during 1970's Japan is interesting especially when Japan began to restructure 30+ years after WWII while modernising once again to help pave way to the electronic boom that the country has today!Tony Curtis does a tolerable role as the manager for the Bears and Japanese Pro Wrestling legend Antonio Inoki makes a rare appearance outside Japan's culture setting to take part in the movie!So if your interested in little league baseball, retro Japanese culture, and enjoy watching a good fun movie for you and your family, then this film is just what you have to see!"
3,Not good in a long run,"The set is beautiful and changes the bedroom completely. The only bad part is that colors started to fade extremely in about a month with appropriate wash and dry cicles and detergents, etc. etc. Also, mine came in with a white fold in flat sheet - like it was not stretched when they colored the sheet. But it is ok. Didn't feel like returning the item. Anyway, once again - it is gorgeous!"
5,A Beautiful Bargain,"After owning four coffee makers in the past four years (2 Krups, GE, Cuisinart) this machine tops them all. It brews hot, smooth coffee very quickly, the carafe pours without a drip, the filter basket is easy to remove for cleaning, and the drip-stop feature actually works. To top it off, it accomplishes its' mission without sounding like a Shuttle launch. For the price, there is nothing like it !"
2,Disappointing Taylors Earl Grey,"I decided to try this product after hearing very good things about Taylors of Harrogate. Unfortunately this Earl Grey was very disappointing. I cannot be sure if the tea was inherently bad or that it was due to bad packaging. The tea bags were not individually packaged and when I opened the box, there was absolutely no scent of bergamot. The flavors had all but lost due to exposure to air, assuming the flavors were there when the tea was first blended. After steeping, there was a strong bitter taste and a very faint resemblance of an earl grey. The tea was not expired. In fact the expiration date is three years away. It's interesting to speculate what taste it will have by then."
4,Great music for the car,This is great music for the road. The songs are upbeat and the variety of artists makes it very enjoyable. These older favorites bring back great memories. It's easy to skip to the next song if you don't care for a particular song or artist. I've given this CD as gifts to family and friends.
5,A Classic,"Margaret George does total justice to the face which launched a thousand ships by bringing the beautiful Helen of Troy to life in a novel that will surely be a historical fiction classic. Part epic tale, part mini-series-like drama, we are taken to Helen's home in Troy and shown what life was like thousands of years ago. The action is believable, as are the men, whose roles are far too often downplayed in many historical fictions.What impressed me the most about this book are the detailed descriptions. You really get to know the clothes, the food, the landscape - it's as if Ms. George stepped back in time and saw it for herself."
3,Not Up to Usual Margaret George,"This book tells the story of Helen of Troy from Helen's perspective. While it is written with the usual grace that Margaret George exhibits, the story didn't engage me. Perhaps telling a myth as reality didn't allow for the usual historical facts that are a mark of many of her other books."
4,Well written and easy to read.,"Not as intriguing as her Cleopatra or Henry the VIII, but also not based on fact in any real sense so that shouldn't be surprising. Her writing is of course engaging and as always I learned some things I didn't know before."
1,pitiful,"I used to like DeLorme's products. THis one is poor at best as far as being functional. GPS takes forever to locate, map loading from desktop to PDA is not as easy as the interface would have you believe, and you cannot adjust zoom level manually.As poor as the Pharos / Ostia package is, it beats DeLorme in functionality. I wish it had the POI and address info that DeLorme has ... better yet, I wish DeLorme had thier functionality. I am returning the DeLorme product in the morning."
1,It's so un-user-friendly,"This is the second mapping software I bought. The first one is Pharos GPS for pocket pc, it was a waste of money, very hard to use and the map disappears on its own. This one is not much better either. I'm returning it."
1,sigh...,"what happened? im just perplexed. i like different styles of music & i am all for supporting bands that i like to switch it up a bit & expand themselves. but i still expect the same passion & creativity to come through, even if they banged on some pots or played spoons.i dont want to say anything bad about them, because all these years (its been over a decade) & as the dust brothers, they have continued to please me very very much. ive seen them live 4 times. im just hoping this was a once off & we can get passed it. i've heard rumours that sony kind of pushed them this way but who knows????"
3,"""Salmon Dance"" Outstanding","This recording is exceedingly middling, on the whole, with one stand-out track -- the very track that many reviewers (e.g., Cary S. and A.E. Solinas) put down. I'm speaking of ""The Salmon Dance,"" which is hilarious, trippy and funky."
3,Okay,"I thought it was an okay book, but as I was reading, I found myself skipping through all the blah blah blah to get to the actual animal stories. The stories about the animals were great, but you have to wade through a lot to get to them."
3,I bought this based on the high reviews here,"Unfortunately, no one mentioned that it fits like a vice (my head's not THAT big). Five minutes was the longest I could wear it."
4,Good Value 4 the Money,"I came on amazon.com looking for some noise reducing headphones under $30 bucks and stumbled across these. After reading the reviews they looked pretty exceptable so i decided to purchase them.They are what i expected, especially if im listening to something on the computer (games, music, etc.) has a acceptable amount of base. Combining the volume control on the computer and on the headphones it gets pretty loud.The only con about these is listening to a mp3 player or personal cd player, it does'nt block outside noise as much as i want it to. Also the cord is VERY long, and that can be a hassle carrying it around, but i wrap tied it with one of those little wire bread tiers so it stays out of my way. These are great for people that want some decent head phones for a computer. They work great on cpu's, but dont do much noise canceling on personal cd players or mp3 players at all."
5,Wow!,"I have never had earphones of this quality because I have never made myself pay that little amount more to get them, and I always got them in-store. I love these headphones! They arrived in 3-4 days (I ordered late in the day). The cord is SUPER long, which is great. I leave it bundled up though in the nice metal wires for tying it came with.The bass is superb! I thought it seemed like the sound was coming out more on the left than the right...if someone could explain if this is common or not I would appreciate it. This was fixed by simply panning the sound from the left to the right in Windows (Vista 64 Ultimate).The volume control is great since my speakers would not adjust the volume of my old headphones when they were plugged in, but instead were maxed out. This fixes it.All in all, this is a recommended purchase!"
2,"Not quality, for listening anyway","The headphones for the price are ergonomically designed well, the volume control is a nice little feature. And the 20ft cable is nice if you are going to be moving across the room and don't want to have to take them off.The speakers themselves are crap, Im not saying they aren't high end enough, they are the quality of the $2 ones at the dollar store. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, I paid $20 for mine and honestly they aren't even worth that. I don't expect perfection or really anything even coming close, but I have gotten on the ear headphones which came with walkmen and handheld cd players(over 15 years ago) that have had better sound quality."
4,Great Value,"The audio Quality is great for inexpensive headphones. What I really liked though is that the foam surrounds go around your ears instead of on them which makes it possible to comfortably wear these for hours.The input sensitivity is low so it takes more power to drive these than many others. Basically, you have to crank up the volume to get the same response out of this pair.If I was still looking for some good bargain headphones again I'd definitely consider buying these."
3,For $18 not a bad pair of cans,"Ive had these for about 4 months now and have dropped them, thrown them down, etc and they still work fine. I use them for watching movies and they get the job done. I just upgraded to a Senheiser HD 205 for $70 at Best Buy ($50 gift card needed to be used) and when I compared the sound I was blown away at what the Philips were lacking in...especially in noise cancellation. Bottom line, these are worth it if you need to go cheap so dont hesitate."
2,Only for the WW 2 Junky,"This was a somewhat interesting book from a different point of view then we usually get in by American or English authors works. The details are interesting and not usually reported. I think the book could have benefited from either better editing or a straight chronological method in presenting the story. I also know that when books are translated you usually miss out on some of the more subtle points the author was trying to make and I find the writing is usual a bit more wooden as you have with this transcript. For me personally I would have liked more detail of when he was a soldier and less about the post war trip to France. It was probably the only politically correct way to publish the work, but I felt that it was experiences that did not help the book. If you read a lot on World War Two then this is an interesting view into the German solder. If you are a casual reader then I would look a little further."
2,I hate Clinton but hate this book more!!,"I hate President Clinton with a passion, but I hate this book even furter. This book covers allegations that have already been covered by other people. It was just waste of my time reading this book. I thought China Doll would give new insight on how Clinton ""sold us out."" I was greatly disappointed to find out Mr. Delgaudio has written a book that seems to be a cut and paste from other books about Clinton/China scandal."
2,Not for all walkers.,This product doesn't fit all walkers. Would not work on mine. It requires that the front bar of the walker is straight across. My walker has an outward curve. Nothing in the specs said anything about this limitation. Also it was a bit of a hassle to assemble. It's now in the junk pile and I built my own from a heavy duty cardboard box.
2,"Beware, walker might not fold up completely with this basket","You can't see exactly how this basket fits from the only picture. More pictures should be shown. This basket fits well on the walker with only 1 cross bar. It might not fit on walkers with 2 cross bars. The basket is slanted, not straight up-and-down. So the bottom rear edge of the basket sticks backward into the area of the lower cross bar. Even more importantly, since the bottom rear edge sticks backward like that, the walker can no longer be folded flat. This makes it difficult to fold it and put it in a vehicle."
1,again and again,"another cover, same crap, see what i mean? this is not todd-it was a bad idea to make the deal to make this album-now there are at least a half dozen different releases of the same thing and what a piece of crap it is...sounds like someone turned on the album while these 80s gtr players solo over tr stuff ... it stinks to hig heaven, stay away..a rip off"
5,Great books,"I loved these stories. I had read both of them when they were part of Nora's Language of Love stories, and I think they were both sensational. But, in case you didn't know, these are reprints, but definitely worth taking a second look at again. I would have to say my favorite is Ruth and Davidov's story. It was very romantic and he is the kind of guy I could only dream of finding. Great stories!"
3,Not for Beginners....,"....or anyone who doesn't want to be Rembrandt. This author is perhaps a Master, but the title implies an Old Master. His technique of painting appears skillful, yes, but didn't appeal to me because they were all in the Rembrandt mode of painting.I'm sure the prose, though disjointed and sometimes contradictory, may be helpful to Intermediate/Advanced artists or Art Teachers, but way too much combing through of the book is required than should be necessary. The info is not organized in a useful way. Sorry...."
5,I love this book,"Although not really a beginners book and without notes on mediums, pigments ect or a clear step by step. This still has to be one of the best instructional art books I own. David Leffel has to do the nicest, modern 'old master' still lifes of anyone I've seen and the book is worth it for the catalogue of his work alone. True, some of the prints are blurry and out of focus which is disappointing but I would still rate it as a must have for any realist artists bookshelf.This book, plus works by Thomas Buechner, Richard Schmid and Gregg Krutz (and a book put out by the Rijksmuseum on still life techniques) have to be the overall best and most helpful art instruction books available at the moment in my opinion for the realist painter.If you like realist still lifes then get it - it's worth it."
1,Horrible Image Quality,"I have to warn you that I was extremely disappointed in the printing quality of this book. Every image lacks any saturated color, the blacks look flat and gray removing any punch that may have existed in the original paintings, and most of all, they are blurry to such an extant that I feel ripped off. I can guarantee you that many of these image files didn't even meet the 300-dots-per-inch requirements of offset lithography. Yes, a publisher can print lower resolution images, but they will look exactly like the images in this book; awful, blurry, lacking punch and conveying abysmal quality. It's not a cheap book, but the printing is decidedly so."
1,Not what I thought it would be.,I did not care for this compelation at all. I couldn't recommend it. It's much more souly that I expected.
1,No time for perfect coffee,This coffee maker makes great coffee but the atomic clock does not work! The atomic clock for this coffee maker worked for about and week and then quite. I have been trying to get the coffee maker repaierd or replaced for over three months. Melitta refers you to Salon the manufacturer who has a completely unresponsive customer service department. Customer service does not respond to e-mails and telephoning produces little reults. I have been promised a return authorization and mailing label for months and have yet to see it. May be I need to talk to George Forman since they also make his grill to see if he can help get it repaired..
1,Perfect Time? No Time!,"Makes good coffee quickly, but forget the atomic clock unless you live on a mountain top with Colorado in Clear view (where the signal originates). There is no way to manually set it either--as confirmed by their customer service rep. And, if the clock doesn't set, there is no way to use the automatic timers for brew start, etc."
3,Early Days,I have been too busy (aren't we all at this time of year?) to do anything more than browse the pages but so far I'm impressed. The book fell open at a recipe for biscuits -- cookies if you're American -- and I wanted to make them immediately. I didn't come across anything that required 'foreign' or hard to find ingredients and nothing seemed too complex to make in my home kitchen. Everything reads as delicious! If this review had been requested a month or so later I'm sure I'd have included one or two more stars.
5,Convenient little device,"If you're like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free PCMCIA slot, this is an excellent value. Leave it in your slot all the time, it won't have an effect on your system when the CF card isn't in, but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system.This means that you can dispense with the camera-to-computer cable and just plug the card into the slot. When you do, it will be recognized as a removable disk, kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk, and show up in your ""My Computer"" view or Mac desktop, and maybe (this is how Nikon View works anyway) pop up your digicam software.This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop."
5,Inexpensive and still fantastic,"CF readers with USB cords? Why bother? Say goodbye to those bothersome cords! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE. One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading. I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing! It's so simple to use, light-weight, compact -- and incredibly inexpensive! How simple? Plug your CF card in one end, plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive. How sweet is that?"
2,cheap,Whats up ordered a viking paid 28.00 and change. And got a dazzle. Looks like the 8.95 adapter>
3,Dated but good.,"This was probably a great book in 1985, but be warned, it is dated. It has a fascinating history of the AR-15, and helped me field strip my Bushmaster. Would love to see an updated version."
5,Fits where other tools do not,"Small, grippy, strong, the price is fine. This will fit into places and do things that larger ones can't. Awesome."
1,The battle for a refund.....,"What a complete waste of space in any bookcase. The wonder of this book is not that the publisher consented to print it, but didnt demand their retainer back. A fatuous subject (a 'journalist' devoid of originality) with poor attempts at humour and is downright patronsing as only the English abroad know how to be. I want my money back!"
1,Product Review for Elegance Keyboard,"The company shipped a different keyboard than that which is in the photo. The name of the keyboard was not Elegance, but Huntington. The Huntington is not black, as featured, and boasts 100 voices. However, there is no quality of distinction between most of the voicing, with the exception of about 6. When the instrument is set up with specific voices and preferences, it will default (including volume) to the original start-up mode within a very short period of time, if there is an interval of no keyboard activity. This is annoying and not useful if the keyboard is being used in a professional setting.We chose to keep the product, as it's only being used for vocal rehearsals. However, had it been a higher quality, we would have made a place for it near our piano for other functions."
3,The Richmond Reviewer Is Right,"The previous reviewer is correct: the first third of the book indeed focuses on what the title leads one to expect and does, in fact, give a brief history of the haphazard evolution of the American SAT. However, the remaining two thirds is a loosely interconnecting series of vignettes which does not significantly illuminate the effects of the SAT I on American society in general. Interesting stories, but not what I was expecting."
4,customer request,yep was charged and ready to go when i received it .. bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
4,Great book to help understand what makes a leader.,"After giving a first hand account of four U.S. Presidents (Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton), David Gergen provides qualities which make a good leader. This, however, though it is the conclusion of the book, isn't the most beneficial part of the book. By giving in depth accounts of four different presidencies you see how one President runs the country so much different form another. Also it gives the analysis of events from a point of view that is very uncommon. It really makes it so you can begin to know the real men who served in the oval office, not the man that the media portrayed. Sure, Gergen has his biases, but if you can look through them, you can get an amazing picture of the some of the more recent Presidents."
3,"Not too bad, but the 1940s And Then There Were None was much better.","This is not the worst adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic, but the 1940s And Then There Were None is much better, one of the greatest mystery movies of all times."
4,10 little indians dvd,"Despite that the seller didn't mention that the DVD case had a cut in it,I was very please with my purchase-the DVD played fine, delivered within stated period & overall- an excellent value!"
5,Arilyn at its best again,"After already reading Daughter of the Drow, Evermeet,Elfsong and Elfshadow, I hungrily took up this book to read further on in the intriguing story of elves on Faerun. And I enjoyed it every bit. Discovering more truths about the elven culture and history and a new tribe of elves--the wild forest elves- all of this and more you can find in this book,"
2,Boring,"Neither of my toddlers were interested, despite the ups and downs of toddler rivalry in our house. I thought the pictures were really nice, but they didn't get particularly interested in that either."
5,The Finest Submarine Book I've Ever Read,"This is the finest submarine-related book I've ever read. It details the war patrols of the USS Barb in magnificent detail, including supporting details from the captain's journal, an illegal journal kept by a torpedoman on the crew, radio transmissions and interviews with Japanese captains the Barb faced in combat. The writing is taut and gripping, and the action that is described is unbelievable. If you want to read about real-life heroes doing amazing things in terrible conditions, this book is the one. This is one of the most moving books of heroism I've ever read. It makes me proud to be an American, and proud to be a veteran."
5,Taylor Siluwé is awesome!,"I picked up 'Tough Guys' because I liked the cover. Standing in the aisle, I started reading 'A Taste for Cherries' by Taylor Siluwé because the title entrigued me. He set a sexual tone, without being graphic or smutty about it. It was erotic. I bought the book. I loved it!"
1,Not sure what the point was??,Well I have lots of questions about this book. In the end I found it really not very useful. This is the sharing of 2 peoples emails. It's very boring to me. It was good to see someones interaction but there was no real point to the book. It was a waste of time and money for me.
3,Christ in Cyberspace !,"It seems to me that, through this book, the Lord is once again pointing out that His ways are higher than our ways. I applaud the courage and faith of both these writers to follow the Lord's leading -- and look where it led! I say, ""Yay God"" for sending such a tender-hearted missionary into cyberspace."
3,Wondering,"I got this book with great anticipation when it first came out. As I read it, it was a new look at what church should be. I just had to wonder how to apply this. Knowing the author and then reading the book makes me wonder.Does this apply to his family or does it just apply to certain others? I know some kids that have been hurt over the years that wish what the author wrote in this book were really practiced by him.It is the way the church should be. Maybe the author should put some of this into practice."
4,Fun,"What a great idea to make this adventure in a broken down theme park...with an old carousel, how cool is that? I love the back-stories in the Nancy Drew games, you always come out learning something and having fun."
1,Not my favorite.,"Terrible. If it was an option, I would give 0 stars. Perverted, boring. Don't read it."
3,not his best,"It was ok, not his best series. I hate to say that,because i normally LOVE everything he writes, but still, I finished the series"
3,"Good, but not nearly Ender's Game","As a avid fan of the Ender books, i expected a book as good or better when i bought this book. However i was dissipointed at the book; none of the charecters are as well made as ender was, and the plot is sort of dumb. however it is still worth the money. if you like sci-fi, or OSC books, then buy this one."
3,OCR errors in Kindle edition,"The storyline is relatively decent. Not as great as the Xenocide/Ender universe, but pretty good.Other than claiming human civilization is only 10k yrs old, most of the universe in this series is fairly consistent with itself and with possibility.The characters are fairly well developed, and overall it flows fairly easily.The problem I have is that there are OCR errors all through these books which is an unacceptable editing quality for any format of book. Also, the maps and similar front matter are not high enough resolution to pick out all of the details from the original graphics.These limitations come across as disrespectful to the author and to the audience."
5,The Memory of Earth,I got this book for my husband. It was part of a series that he chose at the Book Exchange. He needed it to finish the series. He seemed to like the whole series. The book was in excellent condition. Postage was more than the book though.
2,Pretty slow; not up to Ender quality,"Not exactly bad, but it's a pretty slow read and just when it seems something interesting is about to happen the book ends with a cliff hanger. No where near the quality of the Ender series."
1,Poor story. Poor editing.,"This is not Orson Scott Card's best work. The focus of the book is on the children in the story and is so similar to his other books that you could easily search and replace names of characters. There are frequent typographical errors and it generally lacks polish. Indeed, the review on the jacket isn't even for this book, rather it is for 'Xenocide'. The story line plods along and you could easily skip entire chapters without noticing. Towards the end of the book it becomes obvious that this was an introduction to a series rather than something that would stand on its own. I'm saddened to write a bad review of an author I am otherwise impressed with."
1,NOT a USB-to-serial adapter,"Despite what it's called in Amazon.com's listing, this is NOT a USB-to-serial adapter; it is a HP Jornada-to-serial adapter. When I finally received it, I noticed that nowhere on the actual box does it mention USB. It would appear that this is a listing error on Amazon.com's part."
2,Bohemia? Keep Looking.....,"Tom Wolfe she's not. She may be in love with her subject, but that doesn't save this book from reading like a masters thesis where you're allowed to quote your friends as sources. The points that she makes (bohemians need substitute families, bohemians like drugs, bohemians like old clothes) do not bear the lengths that she goes to make them. The scenes that she cites were over fifteen years ago; during her record store days they were just switching from vinyl to CDs. If you're looking for what constitutes bohemia now in America I would wave you off this book. If you're looking for a fun read about ""bohemia,"" I would do likewise. She tries to lighten the going with the occasional witty description, but these don't help a wild subject marry a wooden, pseudo-scholarly style. You have to wonder, in those groovy San Francisco group-pads she invokes, what she was reading..."
1,Smug Middleclass Entitlement,"With all the high adventure of a sack race at a Junior League picnic, a boho wannabe goes forth. The acute self-delusion in this book, written by a self-satisfied New York Times pop critic (my, how marginal and maverick) is really quite alarming. Alas, there is no gypsy in this spoiled soul."
2,Please don't waste your time....,"More than a year has passed since I bought and read this book, and while I truly dislike spreading negativity, I feel compelled to warn others tempted to spend their time and money on this depressing memoir. The book is mistitled; the author and her feather of friends are neither 'weird' or 'bohemian'. Re-titling this book 'Ennui: My Self-Absorbed America' would properly describe the story told within.Honestly - from a woman who cherishes my thousands of books...I could not allow this blot on my shelves, or in good conscience donate it...I threw it away."
4,Incorrect Size,"The product is advertised as containing 4 ounces but it is a one ounce bottle. For the price, it is still worth it."
2,I DON'T LIKE THIS,"I FOUND THIS ORDER TO BE THE REAL THING. IT IS WASHED OUT. WHEN I USE IT THE ODOR ONLY LAST FOR A HALF HOUR. AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT AND RECCOMENDING IT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, I WILL REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ODERING AGAIN. ESPECIALLY WITH THIS NEW LABEL BOTTLE."
1,No good for sauna,I use oils for sauna aroma therapy for over years. This brand is not good for this purpose.I recommend oils by Aura Cacia.
2,"on the basis of my experience, it does nothing about mice","Before putting peppermint oil around the kitchen, we were catching about a mouse a week with thed-CON 00027 Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trap. Since putting pads soaked in peppermint oil in strategic locations, we have continued to catch about a mouse a week.Two stars rather than one because it smelled nice."
3,Does what is was intended.,Nice to have a large bottle so that it is more economical than buying smaller containers at the store. Thanks
5,Great,Used it in my lip balm and it worked great and I have tons to spare!!!! a little goes a long way
1,Poisonous for cats,"I purchased this item based on the number of good reviews it received. After I purchased it, I went on to read some of the reviews and one of them jumped out at me stating it was a ""danger to cats"". I went onto the ASPCA website and it is indeed dangerous to use peppermint oil around cats. The ASPCA recommends not using peppermint leaves or oil in areas where your cat is allowed access. This information should have been listed on the product information so cat owners could see this before purchasing the product."
3,Great smell,Bought this to get rid of mice and I don't see any results but my house smells like a gum factory. like the smell so its not all bad
5,Very peppermint,After reading a bunch of reviews I decided on this brand and size pretty much based on price because peppermint oil is peppermint oil..... The quality is great it sure does smell a lot! I bought this as it is said to keep rats away and it seems to do a good job as I don't see anymore droppings. But I also use a ultra sonic noise machine as well! but overall this is a good value.
