2,Not what I needed,This book was more encyclopedic than inspiring. This would be great for a student of design. It was not helpful for me. I wanted to find decor and furnishing ideas for my unostentatious 1930's home. This book did not offer help to the interior design novice.
4,CHOOSING THE RIGHT SELLER,"This Book (Microsoft Office XP Windows Edition) is a very good tool to study and learn about microsoft Office Office. In adition this page it's a good way to buy this book, BUT you just have to be carefull because sometime you choose the wrong seller, like happenned to me. LOOK FIRST..."
1,The Sony CD Changer that doesn't,"I bought this cd changer to complement a new Sony home theater system. I was replacing a 6 year old JVC shelf system that was superb. Right out of the box this changer had a bad habit of stopping play for no apparent reason during multi-disc shuffle play. I changed discs, using a variety of pre-recorded discs and CD-R's, and wasn't able to pinpoint a reason for the stoppages. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes the player played for a couple hours, and sometimes it would stop after only a song or two. It seemed to stop only while it was between tracks. After two weeks of playing with it, I exchanged it for another player (same model), which did the exact same thing. Finally, I took the unit back today for a refund and bought a higher-priced Onkyo changer."
1,GREAT Laxative,"Just okay as a sugar free candy, but WoW what a laxative. After eating less than half a bag is less than an hour - I spent the next 10 hours racing back and forth to bathroom. And buyer beware because policy on this item is NO RETURNS. So, this item will end up in the garbage because I can't use it, and I wouldn't give it to my worse enemy."
4,Embrace the ambiguity!,"This is a book that is hard to wrap your mind around. Didion does not tell you a clear story with well-defined characters and a plot-without-holes. Instead, the reader must do a little work here. It is what is not told in the story that is so fascinating. Didion appears to be making a comment on the impossibility of truly knowing other people's motivations, inner thoughts, and who they are at the core. All we can do as humans, and therefore in a sense informal anthropologists, is make assumptions from what we see, hear, and perceive. Sometimes we are correct; sometimes we are very wrong. But, that's okay. If you are the type of person who likes things neat and tidy, you will probably be disappointed. If you like books that make you draw your own conclusions, and perhaps feel ambivalent about most of the characters even to the end, then you will like this one. I tend to be the latter, so I did enjoy it."
2,A triumph of mediocrity and shallow delivery,"I am sorry if I disappoint Robin's fans, but it seems those who like him as an actor somehow find it difficult to judge his stand-up act objectively. The truth is, writing is only average and Robin Williams' delivery is very one-dimentional. It is.Do not confuse his fast talking and sizzling on stage with comedy talent. Good stand up takes more, much more than very fast speech. He is a famous actor and all that, but so what? As comedian, he is not in the same league with the big boys.Robin Williams struggles to get out of the beaten track of his acting (and occasionally succeeds); in his stand-up exercise, it's just the beaten track and nothing else.Triumph of mediocrity, really: but then there are people who may like it (oh, and judging by the number of NOT HELPFUL comments that my previous reviews of Williams got, these are people a bit on the angry side, too...)"
2,No second Analog Stick,"Yes. I do know that this is a combat stick specifically made for fighting games but they coulda added the second analog stick to make it functional as a normal PS2 controller. Maybe that's the reason it was so inexpensive. The wireless works great and I was able to use it on my computer using a converter, but without the analog stick I can only play fighting games and I must swap out controllers if I want to play something else that needs the second stick."
5,AWSOME PRAISE,"This is a wonderful praise and worship CD. Me and my daughter listen to it all the time. It soothes the soul, Alvin Slaughter's voice is truly angelic."
2,Difficult to Use,"This product is somewhat difficult to use. I also ordered the ""Munchkin Medicator"" and it is a lot easier to use."
1,A soap opera for graduate students.,"This book came highly recommended. It is excruciatingly over-written. Mary G. never considers less is more. There's no purpose whatsoever to the subplot involving Anna Granite (Ayn Rand, transparently cloaked). Why? What's the point? If you're interested in a mildly kinky, but laborious read, here it is!"
3,Clean and Christian but not all that funny,This is indeed safe for children but it could definiately be funnier without being crude.
3,Tryin' 2 Hard,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Profyle, they are really good singers and have good material but on this sophomore album they are just trying too hard to be street or hardcore. Their debut album Whispers In The Dark is a really good CD, but it's like they did a 180 for their second CD. They have changed a lot from their appearances to their material, becoming a lot more ""ghetto"" compared to the first CD. The second CD isn't all that bad, about half of it is listenable, the other half is mostly just skippable. If you were to get any of the Profyle CDs, I'd highly recommend their debut CD over their second CD."
4,Tight,"The whole cd is tight. My favorite songs are 1,3,4,5, and 11. I realy love Liar the version on the cd is nothing compared to the radio version. It is really tight."
5,mani-pedi deluxe set,I needed to replace the item that I had for several years(it finally burned out). The great thing is that the individual heads from the old unit fit the new one. I have already told friends where to purchase this.
2,Must charge 16 hrs first - only worked 2x and nothing,"First, if you are ready to do your nails and forgot to charge this thing 16 hours prior (not an exaggeration folks, it's in the instruction book), then you must wait or head to the nearest salon.Second, I take great care of my things -- I owned this for a few months and used it twice. Both times it worked fabulously, thus the 2 star rating. The third time, it totally wouldn't charge and there was no power at all - even with the electrical adapter plugged into the device and the LED indicator showing it was charging the unit.Unfortunately, you cannot buy replacement parts for anything but the pads from the mfr so you are now trashing the environment by throwing away a product that has still new parts -- just the primary one won't work. I'm going to buy one of the other better rated products (and avoid Homedics products in the future). Things are only a great price if they work. This one disappoints."
2,amazom music just a simple excellence jungle to hunt music,"please keep up the good music , one thing i like about you guys is that you have supplied mr with a limited stuff that is hard to find that i have searched for ,for a long timekeep it up!!!! please remember to look for Gerald Alston Album (Take me where you want to) pleasethank you so muchThabo"
5,"a twisting, haunting thriller.",sanford keeps you guessing right up until the moment the killer's real identity is revealed. after the revalation you heart races hoping Davenport and his colleagues will find the killer before another murder is committed. You find yourself truly praying they catch on. when i saw who the real murderer was my reaction was oh sh--. i hadn't even thought that and the forthcoming explanations made sense. it was a genuine page turner and not one to start if you have an early day coming up. the murderer in this book was as good as Becker but a lot more diabolical. great read have fun.
3,"Good, but not the best I have ever read","Secret Prey was a good book that had some twists and turns, but it seem very predictable to me. The book was well written and engrossing, and flowed along very fast. I would recommend this book to just about anyone, but I liked some of the other ""Prey"" books a bit better."
5,More please.,"Lucas Davenport is back and as good as ever. I missed his lady friend, but remembering what happened in the last book. I can understand why she needs a break from Lucas and his intensity. I recommend this book to anyone who is not squeamish. If you are, John Sanford and Lucas Davenport are not for you. I bought it and read it in one evening and now I have to wait a year for the next one. So many books and so little time."
2,"Sheer Stubbornness Got Me To The End,...","But stubbornness was all that did. Again, too many characters to keep up with, and a storyline that was to say the least, slow, slow, slow. Finally, near the end of the book, things picked up quite a bit, keeping me going to the end. And even at that, I'm glad it's behind me. I've read good things about the next one, Certain Prey, and may yet read it. But I'll be taking a break from this series, read some other stuff, then maybe get back to it."
5,Another good read,"Another Sandford novel. Reading them all in the order that they were written. Each is better than the last. I have almost rate Sandford right on top with Johansen, Gerritson and Patterson."
4,"As expected, a sit down & do nothing else but read.","Glad to have the old gang back in this one, but didn't feel the ususal attachment to the main character. Also wasn't too crazy about the relationship change!!!!!!!!! Still and all, a very good read and look forward to the next."
5,Great read!,Lucas Davenport is back! The ninth in a series of Prey books and I think one of the best. It was exciting and I hated to put it down. The plot kept evolving right up to the end and Detective Davenport has lost none of his appeal.There was one thing that bothered me though. That his fiance would leave him because of what he does for a living. (Can't help it I'm a hopeless romantic).
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"John Sandford has historically been one of my favorite authors and the ""prey"" series among my favorite books, but this one PLAIN STINKS. Ridiculous character names (i.e. Bone, Weiner), grammatical errors, editing errors, and a rather slow moving plot plague this book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone--especially anyone who hasn't read a ""prey"" book. Don't take this as an example of Sandford's work--this is worse!"
1,Disappointing,"I am an avid fan of Sandford's Prey Series, but this book was a tremendous letdown. I had major problems maintaining any kind of interest mostly because the characters are duds, including Lucas. Previously, reading any of Sandford's other novels in this series was a pleasure--words flowed and the plot was flawless--but this book just ""ain't all that and a bag of chips too."" I really hope Certain Prey doesn't turn out to be the letdown this novel was."
4,"Another strong entry in Sanford's ""Prey"" series","I enjoyed ""Secret Prey"" thoroughly. It divides into two separate parts. The first part is essentially a whodunit. I was entertained as my probable suspect, in classic whodunit fashion, was promptly murdered. After I got further into the book, however, I realized that the author cheated somewhat in this first section--even an astute reader will not be able to guess the killer. The second half of the book is much better. It gets into the mind of a smart, creepy killer, who can match strategy step-for-step with Lucas Davenport. This is reminiscent of the best of the ""Prey"" series, like ""Eyes of Prey"". I'd give this book a try, and stick with it."
1,Slow and pretty limited,"Installation was uneventful. I selected the first DVD in the ""Area 88"" set: three half-hour animes. You have the option of selecting languages and titles, and Crunch keeps the orginal Dolby soundtrack. But first: it cached all three selections, an agonizingly slow process. Then, when I selected ""Itunes"" as the target destination, it didn't default to the ""Library - Movies"" section. Why not? In fact, Crunch didn't even SEE that destination. Now for the converstion. Whaaaaaat?? It hung at ""0% complete"" for at least 30 seconds, then sloooooooowly started. At the rate it was working, it would have taken hours to convert the material. DVD Fab does the same job in probably half the time. And guess what? It will only convert unencrypted DVDs, so don't count on this as your tool for loading your video Ipod.There are free products out there that do the job, and do it faster, than Crunch."
4,Fun fun fun!,"If you are an Ipod user, this software is a must. It makes video conversion a snap and it's EASY. That's the best part."
1,Not Very Useful,"I was really looking forward to this product. I'd heard that it was possible to save your DVDs in a format that would make them transferable to ipods. Great idea, how can I do that? This product looked to fit the bill exactly. Well, it's not very difficult to install, but that is about the only good thing about this product. I tried to transfer several commercial DVDs and none of them worked. When I pulled them up, there was an icon with a lock on it--no explanation, but after a while it became clear that commercial DVDs won't transfer. So, after all that, I'm still looking for the product that will help me transfer DVD movies to my ipod. Maybe this is something the movie industry won't let me do, but I warn anyone who is thinking of buying this product to consider what they will use it for. If you want to transfer your own movies, that'll probably work, but if you want to run out and buy Knocked Up so you can watch it on your ipod during your commute to work, this won't help you."
4,The Old with The New,"2002 marks the Lobos 25th Anniversary of recording and the advance publicity for the ablum, plus the nifty little documentary on the ""Limited Edition Enhanced CD"", are placing this event centrally in the creative mix in which this was made. This album has the feeling of a retrospective without being composed of old material or material that sounds like old material. (That seems like an accomplishment to me.) It's ""classic"" Lobos in that the songs are conventionally structured on familiar Lobos subjects. It is ""new"" Lobos in that performances and recordings are nuanced with a bit of experimental flare. ""Nuanced"" rather than submerged. While I have greatly enjoyed the trippy experience of Kiko, Colossalhead, and This Time, I am always glad to see any artist shake things up by turning the tables every now and then. It is THEIR band, after all."
5,Bonus cuts worth the price of admission,"Why would Sheena's bonus tracks on BEST KEPT SECRET be kept secret for so long? ""I Don't Need Your Word"" is a hidden gem that should have seen the light of day back in 1983. If you're an Easton fan, don't miss this one!"
3,"A couple clunkers, but overall a worthy effort","Long before Celine Dion was belting out the power ballads, there was Sheena Easton. Her 1983 effort, ""Best Kept Secret"" contained some incredible moments. ""Almost Over You"", and ""Just One Smile"" are some of Sheena's greatest vocal moments. However, Sheena fails to deliver the goods on tunes like ""Let Sleeping Dogs Lie"" and ""I Like The Fright"". I think this was Sheena's attempt to shed her goody-goody image and go for a more 'dance' feel to her music. While this cd is overall worthwhile, you will find yourself hitting the advance button on your CD player more than once. For a better range of what Sheena can really do, check out her earlier work on 'Madness, Money and Music'."
5,Best Kept Secret,Best Kept Secret yeah right this cd is darn good so why would she ever called it best kept secret. I love the way she looks on the cover she's got that look on her face that says do you want to mess with me?Rondall
2,Breaks down constantly,This is a poorly made product. I have used it less than 30 hour and have had it repaired 3 times for parts that have stopped working or bust open. Do NOT buy this product.
5,Works great for a fraction of the cost.,"I used it to connect my digital camcorder to my laptop. Worked great and for a fraction of what I would have paid at Best Buy or Ciruit City and others. As a previous review pointed out, the connectors are not gold - but they don't appear that way in the picture either."
4,Nice Price!,You can't beat the price of this cable. I hooked it up between my camcorder and dvr and it worked fine. You don't need an expensive cable to transmit digital info.
5,Cable,Just what I was looking for and the cheapest around. I can't believe what others charge for this cable. Great deal!
4,Bargain price!,"I bought this cable to connect my digital camcorder to a laptop. The manufacturer wanted over twenty bucks for the same cable. This item was a bargain, and functions essentially the same as the OEM."
1,"Not worth the money and time, Sorry!!!","I placed an order for two of these cables and after waiting a few days, i got only one in the mail. I had to contact the seller and request a refund for the other one. When I tried using the cable, it was broken, I had to contact the seller again and communicate the problem, he offered the money back but by now paying for shipping would not make any since. The cable costs less that the shipping i would Have had to pay. Please Don't buy this cable, buy Belkin even if you have to pay more, at least you would get a quality product."
5,108 piece art set,"Excellent materials, great variety of art mediums, good color selection. My 6-year-old granddaughter loves it."
4,A Pleasant Journey,I heartily enjoyed this gem of a book which offers a good sampling of the American short story. I had forgotten how delightful this genre is--this book has helped fill my need for good literature with its thoughtfully selected stories. Those who have gotten away from the short story may enjoy the fifty offerings in this nice book. Give it a try!
2,Mean-spirted and vulgar humor,"Mean-spirted and vulgar humor, tasteless jokes, and shallow, petty friends. Welcome to one of the shows that has contributed substantially to the decline of quality on American television. The reality show participants (Survivor, Bachelor, etc.) can hardly be worse than the sterling characters on Will & Grace. I have friends who used to watch Will & Grace, but they just kept pushing those boundaries. Soooooo Hollywood."
1,Blackmarket Bootleg Scam!,"I am a huge Will and Grace fan, and I already have 3 other season sets, including the first one. This is an obvious fake! The DVDs come in one cheap case. Everyone knows that TV series on DVD come in the nice sleeve that they always do with a booklet-type sleeve that includes episode descriptions. I received ZERO of these things. All I received was a bogus basic DVD case that individual DVDs are typically sold in. This is bogus, and I want a refund! Who can watch a season of a show with no episode descriptions? I can't believe they are scamming like this!"
5,"Will, Grace, Karen, and ""Just"" Jack!","my friend said he watches will and grace, so one night I got intersted and watched and episode and i was on the ground laughing. i have watched this show ever since. Let me tell you, my family watches and enjoys it, and my best friend watched it and enjoys it. everytime we're together we try to watch Will and Grace, or if we can't we talk about the episodes we saw apart. Its that good. Plus the acting is superb. All four of those people deserve nods.One rviewer mentioned how many awards they were nominated for and deserve evry single one, especially Sean Hayes and Megan Mullaly. The script is terrific as well. I don't see why Friends gets so much attention, it doesn't even reach standars for Will and Grace."
2,Not as good as I thought,"There are only a couple of good songs on this CD. I was dissapointed with it. I like catchy songs, and there wasn't much to enjoy here. I recommend ""Rag Na Rok"" or ""We Kill Everything"" over this."
4,"Nice size, easy to read","I like this scale because it has a large area to stand. I also like it because it is very easy to read. It does seem to not be exact, but within a couple pounds. You can get on and off several times in a row and be a pound or two up or down each time. But, if you don't need it to be exact, it is a nice scale. I had a similar one which my husband smashed under the garage door which had chrome around the numbers and that turned green which was kind of nasty so I prefer the white plastic on this one. I also like that you have little tabs you can set to track weight for multiple people in the family. It is large, but I like that feature. I tried several smaller ones at the store and felt like I was falling off~"
5,Everything exactly as advertised,"Great product, boxed well and recieved very quickly. A more perfect transaction could not have occurred. Highly recommended to any and everyone looking for such a product!"
2,Boring!,I purchased this DVD set due to the high ratings. I have enjoyed a Kettlebell Bootcamp work out and wanted to change it up. All it is all the same moves over and over. Ridiculous. I paid [...] to do something I could have done on my own.
1,Flimsy,"very thin slats, if i were to touch it before buying it i would have never bought it, well maybe for 5 bucks"
3,Cheap item; faulty assembly,"Jack Post Jennings Traditional 5-Foot Swing Seat in Unfinished Solid Fir with Hang Chain+++One of the two main parts for the swing was partly broken. The wooden planks had been screwed and tagged together but one of the main screws was yanked off the wood due to rough handling? The holes in the wood are wide open. There is not enough space to drill a new hole?The label on the packaging said "" Made in China"". It was assembled sloppily.I am skeptical if the received item is safe to use?++++I have pictures to prove it too. I even produced a quick video with stills. I would love to share it here.Sorry, but my video was not accepted by Amazon. I got an error message because Amazon's system does not seem to accept Apple's mv4 format videos. Why? I can only guess. This is frustrating.Thanks for reading my verbal feedback above.Best,Dee"
4,Porch Swing,"This porch swing is great, but I did have issues with the shipping. UPS need to work on some things!"
3,It's OK,"After opening the box, this swing really makes you question if the cost savings was worth it. Don't get me wrong, it was easy to assemble and does hold my weight with my two young kids, but based on how it felt while swinging, I was constantly wondering if we were going to plunge to the ground. Like others suggested, I'm going to strengthen with some extra screws and 1x2's to make it more sturdy. I'm glad I didn't have fork out an extra $100 bucks or start from scratch and buy all the supplies from the box store though. I won't mind the little extra effort. Does the job...recommended if you don't mind a little more securing work."
1,And the Golden Raspberry goes to...,"This is one of those movies that make you wish you could have your 2 hours back. A ""friend"" told me the scariest thing about this movie is that the events in it could happen. I guess he knows more ventriliquist/stalker/murderers than I do. This movie is probably the worst horror movie I have seen except for maybe Frogs or Uncle Sam. Watch it for a few laughs and even fewer scares."
3,It works BUT...,"...it generates a fair amount of RF interference. If you use this in a car, you can pretty much expect that your AM radio reception will be significantly compromised, and if you use it to power a CD power or similar, unless the player itself is quite well filtered internally, you'll notice audible buzzing through the player's audio outputs (I have a Sony CD player that is really bad in this regard).It does do a fine job of creating power, and I suppose for the price you can't really ask for a lot of internal filtering. So... the bottom line is that it's a fine product if the aforementioned limitations either don't apply to you or don't bother you."
3,Not for Me,I thought this book had good information and was quite helpful for the subject overall but a wee bit too clinical for what I was needing. What we really needed was a way to get out of the rut we were in which frankly made sex boring. We would both rather masturbate than just go through the motions.Fortunately a friend recommended 500 Lovemaking Tips which gave some creative and juicy tips that gave me the boost I needed.
1,What a Joke,"I orderes this book for what seemed like a good price, thinking it was a nice old hardcover book.It came the very next day and i was happy to get it. Imagine my suprise when i open it up and it's a pink childrens book, only 61 pages long.Just like a hardcover comic book. The introduction talks to you as if you are a teacher at a preschool. The return was easy."
1,somebody screwed up!!,"Picture shows a very nice-looking collectable book, which my wife adores. MUCH to our surprise, followed by huge belly laughing, the book ended up being a childs animated, PINK story book of about 60 pages!!! Was this a cruel joke?? The laughing ALMOST made it worth the screw up! Thankfully, Amazon promptly refunded our money and shipping. They have always handled things professionally. I do hope someone got a nice handslapping, though!!"
4,light and handy,it's light an veryhandy in small gardens.easy to start and handle.recomend it to anyone who wants to start a garden'the only thing i see wrong is i can't find repairparts for it.
2,Problems,"I saved a lot of money, after replacing it did not fix the problem and now 3 other things do not work. They may be the fault of the dealer that programed"
1,pure garbage,"I am commenting on this junk because I am purchasing a replacement for my brother. Here are 3 major problems with this drill. 1) batteries will not charge in cold weather. 2)Tool clip will not hang effectivly. 3) Will not survive a 10' drop. Thus me here commenting on this junk, tool clip failed, fell off a 10' eve and smashed in half at handle. I would recommend the Makita 18v Lithium Ion impact driver which is lighter comes with a clip that works is as every bit as powerful, and charges in the cold. Ive had mine for over two years with zero problems."
2,"Lightweight Prey--No Emotional ""Punch""","As a lontime Prey series fan, I found this one to be mediocre. Basically the central premise is a lawyer joke--e.g. ""How do you know when a lawyer's lying? Her lips are moving"". I believe Sandford had this great idea for a contract killer character in Rinker, and tried to wrap a novel around that character. Mr. Sandford--you can't have neat, symmetrical TV miniseries morality and produce a the kind of novel that frightens and enthralls fans. The easy and ridiculously improbable ways Lucas finds clues in this one make it seem like Sandford was just wearily pugging in plot details. Plus, the demise of C.L. was just bizarre and meaningless. I'd bet there was a ""darker"" draft of this novel that got rejected--I for one, would like to read it."
2,Very disappointing.,"I read every single Davenport book and loved them all. The story was weak. The two females were ridiculous. There was NO suspense. NO staying up all night (I actually fell asleep reading it). I'll wait for the next one, hopefully it will be better."
4,I LOVE Lucas Davenport!,"As a sixteen year veteran of the ""most rapacious gang of weasels in the North Woods"" (aka the Wisconsin State Patrol as John Sandford describes us!), I only wish law enforcement could be done as he describes it! The plot details might be implausible, but the book should be read for its entertainment value, not a law enforcement manual! I do wish, though, that Mr. Sandford had identified Carmel's mole in the department--that could have been an interesting little sub-plot. A great read, I think, as are all of the 'Prey' novels! P.S. to Mr. Sandford: You have a free ride when I'm on-duty! State Car 370"
3,"Great start, tepid finish","I love the Lucas Davenport series and wished they would be made into movies, but let's get to the book.I thought John Sanford created two great villains in the lawyer and the bounty hunter and their interaction early on the book kept me riveted. However, as smart as they were early on in the book, they seemed to lose some of their steam at the end of the book.I found the last 1/3 of the book to be rather ordinary, and as good as Lucas is, its hard to believe all the pieces fall into place for him during this mystery.I'll read the next one that comes out, but I hope we see a little more vulnerability back in Lucas in the next one."
3,Will they?,"Lucas Davenport is on the case, now Deputy Chief. A female assassin is on the rampage in Minneapolis with a female co-hort. It looks as if they are going to get away with their vicious crimes until Lucas stumbles upon crucial evidence.Characters are shallow, we don't really care why they are the way they are. And we don't really care either way if they're caught.But the book is written well, and we long to find out what Davenport's been up to. Will he sleep with Sherrill the female cop with big boobs? You gotta read to find out."
3,Disappointing. I missed Lucas Davenport.,"I missed Lucas's love life, was very disappointed to find that he and Sherrill broke up somewhere between the end of the last book and the beginning of this one. I also missed the interplay and relationship between Lucas and his squad.Clara was an interesting villain, but if she comes back, I hope Sandford brings the old Davenport back too."
4,A musical history lesson,"I bought this cassette used at a yard sale and have played it nearly to death. I was never a big fan of traditional Irish music, but the history behind the songs makes it worth listening to. Anyone interested in the struggle for Irish independence would find listening to this an enjoyable learning experience. The songs add another dimension to major players like Michael Collins and James Connolly, while tunes like ""Come Out Ye Black and Tans"" paint a portrait of the animosity between the Irish and their English oppressors. The stories behind the songs are so good I find myself enjoying the music in spite of myself!"
1,Leave it on the shelf,"I bought two of these machines, one for myself and the other for my mother, and we've had nothing but trouble from both of them. Both units began to malfunction almost immediately after they were unpacked. I had to exchange one since we were unable to repair it. The machine was simply unable to read CDs. The second unit needed the entire laser system replaced. A few months after the problems were fixed, they began to act up once again. I will never purchase anything from Aiwa again. A horrible experience."
5,"This CD will put you in a good mood, I promise","""The retards laughed when the evening came . . . the Librium makes 'em all the same.""One of my favorite Lips earlier recordings, it is at once both sparkly and dark, dreamy and slammin', logical and strange, nostalgic but looking toward the future with it's hair full of confetti. Listen to ""Gingerale Afternoon"" first thing in the morning and you'll be in a good mood all day.You must own this CD. I command you."
2,no musical examples,"This may be a good, basic book on counterpoint, but the kindle edition did not have musical examples, which are essential for a work of this nature."
1,An author with a biased agenda,"I am afraid that Ehrman is not an objective scholar. His self publication in the media, as a reactionary sceptic, in reaction to his former protestant (sola scriptura) fundamentalism means his work is suspect at best.Ehrman's origins as a naive fundamentalist were exploded at university and this embittered him to the point that he became a biblical iconoclast. This is not the foundation for sound scholarship. Ehrman's academic blood is poisoned. Any academic work Ehrman produces has a sceptical agenda which is either explicit or, in this case, implicit. My advice, leave well alone and use the work of the more balanced and objective."
3,Writing is going down hill,"Overall I enjoy the series, despite the continuity errors. It has been good cheeky fun. My biggest complaint is about the casing of the dvd's. Much better ways to do that.Also, specifically about season 7... you can tell the writing is going a bit south."
4,"Slow to start, excellent finish","A change in writing staff, the departure of Annette O'Toole, John Glover and the spotty presence of Kristin Kruek make this a bit of an uneven season. The introduction of Supergirl is helpful, but she's soon hustled out of the way, as though the writers didn't really know what to do with her.But the season eventually finds its footing and ends with a solid climax in the fortress of solitude which unfortunately, marks the departure of Lex Luthor from the show. Lionel Luthor's character arc is resolved in a way that answers a lot of questions about his fascination with Smallville. Satisfying overall, but it's time to get Clark flying, off the farm and out into the world."
5,greatness,"It was awesome, the package came intact and ahead of schedule, both of which make me extremely happy. The season itself rocks! Few things better in life than a ton of hot chicks living under one roof. :)"
4,Not the best but it get's better!,"Let's start by saying that I think Smallville is the best show on TV!For the first 6 seasons Smallville has delivered top notch episodes, week after week.Season 7 suffers early on. The introduction of Supergirl, I think, was a mistake. Didn't like her at all. As the season went on she became more likeable. But still...The first 7 or so episodes were not so good but they really stepped up the second half of the season and left us with, quite frankly, one of the best finales yet.Decent special features, (Jimmy on Jimmy is great) The packaging is the best yet.Smallville fans will love it! Now, season 8 with no Lex? Should be interesting."
2,Fine show but Bluray presentation is TERRIBLE,"Smallville season seven's content is well described elsewhere. I want to caution fans from buying the bluray version. Why? Because it appears to have no episode index. I.e., you either start at the beginning of episode one and scroll fast forward or chapter forward on an on until you find the episode you are looking for. And ther are as many as seven episodes on a disc. =8-0If another owner knows the 'secret' of finding an episode index on these discs please correct me. I find that the menu button only gives one choices of special features. Very frustrating and very disappointing."
2,Weakest Episode - Season 7,"I dislike this episode immensely. I gave it 2 stars simply cuz I hate being negative about Smallville. Kara with amnesia is annoying and bringing Pete back to Smallville w/a superpower, no less, completely unnecessary. It really showed how mature Clark was compared to Pete who didn't seem to have aged since season 3. If you want to skip an epi...this is the one to skip."
3,REVIEW OF MAX/MIN THERMOMETER,I am using this item in my hoop-house to keep track of high and low temperatures. It does the job perfectly and I can note max and min every day. But batteries do not last very long.
5,Humidity detector,I keep this in my piano to monitor humidity levels in my piano. The optimal humidity range for pianos is between %35 and %55 percent.
2,Failed after 9 months,"I suppose some folks might consider $14 a reasonable rent for a thermometer/hygrometer for 9 mos. If the unit were 'sold' that way, I might even agree, but it's not.The unit has recently begun reporting completely erroneous temperature. Changed batteries, etc. Clock still works and hygrometer looks reasonably close. But that's it.Oh well."
3,works if...,Works if you realize that the item needs to be calibrated for temp and humidity. I did this by placing unit into a plastic freezer bag along with 3/4 cup of salt filled to the top of the salt with water this should read 75% RH. My unit read 65% after an hour and would not rise any more after three hours. Now I knew that it read about 10% RH off I felt that I was in the ball park. I did the the temp with a standard mercery gauge noting a difference of -2F. For the money a useful product as long as you don't need exacte readingds and ballpark is good enough for you.
1,terrible!!,"Item failed quickly after purchase. seller NO help. replacement purchased locally, cheaper, better. No faith in this seller !!"
2,Disappointing,"Underwritten and half baked. Connelly seems to be gunning for a film adaptation with this so why not skip the middleman and just write a screenplay instead? I'm a big fan of ""Bringing Out the Dead"" - both the book and the movie - and Noir. This book satisfied neither of those appetites. Nonetheless, I'll still take a look at his next work in hopes of something better."
1,Depressing,"I have to say the only redeeming quality of this book is the interesting way Connelly weaves together the disparate stories of his characters and brings them into contact with one another in circumstantial events. But yet the story was so intensely depressing. Does anything good happen even in such a crummy town? Truthfully his characters should all be on Prozac or just commit suicide, then burn the town down too. Not that I'm into wanting a happy end to every story, its just that the bad that happens to these people is just so pitifully stupid and repetative."
2,"B&D 8"" String Trimmer, What a Disappointment!","Simply put, this trimmer is suited for light jobs at best. I don't consider my application heavy duty. It's just your normal yard trimming around trees, fence, sidwalk, etc.The .060 trim line just doesn't hold up and the bump line feeder either continually jammed or didn't work at all. During the first and only use, I had to take the feeder apart roughly 6 times.The battery charge held up as I didn't loose power in the 15 minutes of actual operation time (not including repair time).It is light weight and easy to handle. Easy assembly.The unit was returned to the store after it's first use in exchange for a slightly more expensive gas trimmer.I would give this a one rating, but I'll give this trimmer the benefit of the doubt in hopes it can function in maybe a smaller setting. However, like I said, my application is not heavy-duty."
4,what you and I have through,"I found this to be a great example of Blues Traveler live, it is raw, jammy, and at times experimental. Being a fan of Blues Traveler, of course I had to have this cd and am glad to have this cd in my collection.Anthony hanley"
4,One of Kostners best,"A great action movie with lots of guns, humor, and action packed scene. I love Kostner movie, but have never been a fsn of his acting, he proved that he can play on hell of a villian though!"
2,Stop the Horror!!,"This is one of the craziest and most pointless movies ever created.The basic formula for this movie seems to be ""Lets blow people away for no obvious reason at all and see if anyone notices""!Overall-The action scenes are gory even for an action movie and the ending you can see coming from 5 miles off."
4,Cinematography,"I must say that the movie itself was fairly weak. But I'll still watch it every time it comes on HBO. What I really like about this movie was the cinematography, it was the exeptional aspect of the movie that I really liked. The movie was shot very well, because the Director of Photography obviously new very much what he was doing."
3,FUNNY AND JOHN WOO-LIKE... COSTNER'S MEANEST ROLE EVER,"After seeing this movie, I will never look at Kevin Costner the same way again. He played the role of a ruthless S.O.B. down to PERFECTION. Trust me, by the time the movie clocks 30 minutes you'll FEAR him. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining because of its mix of filmaking techniques. I searched, with no success, the cast and crew credits for names like Quentin Tarantino and John Woo. The cast seems like a Tarantino casting call. Everyone and their mothers are in this one, including Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Christian Slater, Bokeem Woodbine, Howie Long and even Ice-T! Phew! True, not all of them give stellar performances, but who cares as long as they're all swinging guns John Woo style?! Wasn't the greatest flick of all time, but it made for a great rental. Check it out."
4,3000 Miles to Graceland,Good flick to watch. Seen bit's of the movie here and there finely seen it on HBO and had to buy it.Great movie. Lots of action and lots of comedy as well. YOU won't be disappointed if you get this.Mr. Magoo
1,Why MTV ruined the movies,"Movie...this isn't a movie...it's a high octane, over the top, train wreck. It's like a mirage in the Nevada desert, all glimmery and full of hope but ultimately non-existent. The plot is transparent. Everything in this movie is about the shot, the effect, the gag...all without any reasoning. It's total lack of self-control makes this the perfect wet dream for a 12 year old boy. It's the Britney Spears of movies."
4,Assault of the Morality Mob (on this movie),"This movie rocks! It's a fast-paced, in your face action flick with a musical score to match. Yeah, it's got gratuitous violence and some far-fetched parts, but it doesn't bore you with too many details and criss-crossing sub-plots. It's a lot better than the over-cast and over-rated Oceans Eleven.I cant believe the slamming this movie got from some reviewers. Why do these righteous do-gooders even watch a movie like this? They know its not going to give them their required daily dose of morality, so why dont they stick to ""G"" rated movies? I'm tempted to give this movie a 5-star rating just to offset their attack on this movie.Give 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND a chance, and then decide. Dont allow the morality mob to win by poisioning this review. It's an organized attempt to disuade you. And it's far from the worst movie I've ever seen."
4,Music Machine - 'Ignition' (Sundazed),"Total of nineteen tracks,of unreleased and some of the band's super-rare singles from 1965-69.Too bad this late '60's garage/pyschedelic band didn't last longer than they did.Tunes here that I liked the best were the somewhat-inspiring ""Everything Is Everything"",""Black Snow"",""Push Don't Pull"",the psych/pop ""Citizen Fear"" and ""Tell Me What Ya Got"".I mean,all or at least most of every one of these tracks are decent to very good.Overall,'Ignition' is aimed toward the fans who desire to have EVERYTHING that Music Machine had ever recorded."
3,It was ok but...,I was a little disappointed with this CD. I enjoy Marshall Crenshaw's music but it seemed like the songs that they picked for this CD were a little on the sappy side. I expected better than what I got.
1,Would've made a great single.,"When you're around for 40+ years you're gonna make a stinker or two and this was first but not worst. Victim Of Love and Leather Jackets vie for that title. Thoroughly uninspired on every level. The only positive is that Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson were spared from wasting their time playing this rubbish. Instead of taking a hard earned vacation and coming back refreshed, Elton and Bernie went to the well one too many times. The blood is also on Gus Dudgeon's hands too. I will never understand why a band that has Davey Johnstone in it has a zero like the ever embarrassing Ray Cooper so much up front in the mix. This was Elton's first warning that the drugs weren't such a good thing. He did not heed that warning. ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"" and maybe, ""One Horse Town"". Would've made a great single. The rest is tepid pablum. I hated this when I bought it brand new in '76. It didn't age well. I still hate it in '12."
4,Beter than Expected,"For the price this is a lot of sound. Liked them so much that I immediately bought another set as a gift. You don't even have to have a computer ... just your MP3. Some minor design drawbacks but not worth mentioning. Get em while you can. Radio Shack keeps running out of stock & they are more money. Of course, doing business with Amazon is ALWAYS a delight. Very pleased and the price is right."
3,speaker buzz,The speakers are a good model but the set we received have a constant buzz sometimes loud. We decided not to send them back for exchange because it was to much of a hassle to repack and find a post office to send them.
2,could be better,"I just expected better from logitech. I think this because at louder volumes the system struggles, significantly.Also the ipod dock needs serious improvement. Its not really a dock rather a jenga game. Everytime i try to change a song, and i don't take my time, i end up knocking the ipod off the dock."
3,Good Sound Lousy Design,The speakers work fine. But the volume control / I-pod base is hard wired to the subwooffer. The unit would not fit through the wire holes of my heavy computer desk. I had to cut a larger hole in th rear of the desk. Now this isn't an issue with people who have small desks. I just think they should have the volume control wiring with the plug in option.
4,Great speakers but with one flaw.,"I don't regret getting these speaker system. Has lots of nice sound, but when you increase the volume you start getting a lot of distortion. Other than that I have nothing bad to say."
2,Waste of money,"They sounded bad right out of the box. I figured it'll be Ok for the money I payed for it. But in 3 days they started producing terrible static I couldn't stop.It's hard to expect anything good from 20-dollar speakers. So here are bad parts:Charger dock is useless. Subwoofer produces very muffed and unclean bass. Speakers sound very cheap too. Whoever came up with terrible design idea of permanently attaching charging station to a subwoofer with a wire needs to have his head examined. I needed to move 200-pound table to get it set up.Big, big disappointment. I expected much better product from Logitech."
4,"He was right ""Stick with the X-230"" however....",He was right. No matter what I did I couldn't get great sound out of this system until I tried leaving my old set plugged into the computer (inland Pro Sound 2000) and then plugged the new Logitech X-240 into the earpiece jack. Now the sound is excellent. (don't ask me why...its weird). Even though with them set up like this the inland's don't produce sound but somehow they send a better sound and signal to the new Logitech's.
3,Decent Speaker System for an Office,"The sound quality of these speakers is pretty good, but not great. I am using these in my office and they sound ok, though I definitely wouldn't suggest them for an audiophile. My biggest issue with this system is that the desktop control system is hardwired to the sub woofer. This means that the desktop control wiring cannot be run through the wire runs built into my desk. If the unit plugged in to the sub woofer, then the wiring would be much neater."
4,Raving,Part 2 was great! I read part 1 1st and I couldn't wait to find part 2! This book will have you wanting to jump ahead to see what happened before it's time for you to know. Do not read part 2 without reading part 1 1st. Enjoy!!
4,Fresh and Frisky,"I had the DJM lp's Ain't That A Bitch and A Real Mother For Ya' when they came out in the Seventies. I was happy to find this material and other pieces available on a compilation. The liner notes are terrific, too. Enjoy."
4,Ten Years After still smokin,"If you are a Ten Years After fan, buy this tape. The recording is around the early to mid 80's. The sound quality, except for about 20 seconds, is excellent and produced by Leo Lyons. The play list is LOVE LIKE A MAN, I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'M NOT WRONG ALWAYS, GOOD MORNING LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL, HELP ME, WOODCHOPERS BALL, SLOW BULES IN 'C'AND I'M GOIN HOME. Runnig time is around 60 minutes. The approach of the band is no frills and LOUD. Alvin is better than ever. The two songs from the 'UNDEAD'album are a real treat for the fans who followed the band from the very beginning (you know which ones they are). I played this tape for my 14 year old son. He loved it! It's a good deal for the price. Keep on Rocking!"
3,Black & Decker 13-Inch 4.2 amp electric automatic feed trimmer and edger #ST7000,"Works relatively well and makes less noise than others I have owned. It is not made extremely well, however, as the line guard comes off easily and is held on by a tiny screw into a plastic base. Would not buy another. My previous trimmer was a Craftsman from Sears and was superior to this and less expensive."
1,NEVER EVER BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER!!!,"THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX(THE FIRST ONE)I WAS SO EXCITED! IT HAD A RUBBER COATING ON, NO MORE BLISTERS. THEN I TOOK IT TO WORK CAUSE I HAVE ""AMERICAN LAWN SERVICES"" AND AT FIRST IT WORKED GREAT THEN I DECIDED TO DO MY LAWN. BAD PURCHASE AS I STARTED THE AUTO MATIC SPOOL FEED STOPED FEEDING THE LINE WASN'T EVEN STUCK SO EACH TIME THE LINE RAN DOWN I HAD TO TURN IT OVER A MANUALY DO THE FEEDING MYSELF ! BY THE TIME I WAS DONE IT TOOK ME TWICE THE TIME IT TOOK A POULAN WEED EATER. BUT THAT GAVE AFTER NINE MONTHS OF SERVICE! THE DOWNGRADE I PURCHASE IN EXCHANGE WAS JUST AS BAD!!! IF YOU LIKE FLIPPING IT OVER JUST TO GET LINE DONT BUY THESE OR TRUST ME YOUR HANDS WILL HURT WHEN YOUR DONE."
3,good book but a bit typical Sharon Creech...,after reading Walk Two Moons and Chasing Redbird....this book almost seems like a dissapointment...........but none the less is a good book.......but surely not her best.............
4,The Wanderer,I'm a fifth grade student and I'm going to tell what I think of the book called The Wanderer. The Wanderer is a really good book. The Wanderer is one of my favorite books. I would give The Wanderer four stars. Whoever is reading this I hope you it. If you like sailing on an ocean then you'll would like The Wanderer.
4,great story / great service,we had a problem with the copy we initially received - there were several chapters that were missing and others that were duplicated.Amazon immediately sent a new copy - great service. The book is a favorite of my 10 year old daughter - she recommends it to all her friends.
2,The Wanderer,"The WanderThe wander is a very good adventure story about traveling across the ocean in a boat. Unfortunately it is very hard to get into. I had to start it twice before it got interesting.It is about Sophie and her cousin Cody. In the beginning it tells about how Sophie always seemed drawn to the sea and how she was so happy to get to come on this transatlantic voyage with her uncles and cousins. Sophie and Cody write in there journal about there impatience to leave and get to England and see there grandfather. It ends with a surprise about Sophie's identity.If you cannot get into boring books I wouldn't recommend reading this book. If you can, it is an exciting story."
3,Works OK,"This cable is not thae same as the original, but does work. Aparently it fits several Palm products. The data transfer has to be done from the phone, as there is no button on the cable. It charges good."
2,Find another publisher,"While there's definitely some good information in here, and some interesting projects and concepts, there are about 20 pages missing - they're just blank, and it makes it very difficult, obviously, to figure out the steps. It's also badly printed, and bound. I love these books, but wish someone else was publishing them, and for the price, there are other books that will last you a lot longer."
4,"Prada Women's Embossed Leather Wallet, Arancio","Color didn't look like the advertisement, and was alot smaller then expected."
3,A Little disappointed,I definitely would not have bought this rug if I had been able to see it first..Not very good quality..It's not something that I will put in my living room.
3,"Overall, fairly good, but","I'm an avid fan of JCS and have usually enjoyed most of the versions that are floating around out there, but this one has been a good listen and a horrible listen at the same time. What I enjoyed most were the updated orchestrations(80's rock?). Overall, it works, but there are some failures. For example, Everything's Alright. With the update, the comforting feeling that comes with ALWs music is lost, and I never really saw it as a rock song. Overall, it's a good buy, but it will take time to get used to.Great Songs from the AlbumHeaven on their MindsSuperstar-Update really works for these songs."
1,Do not buy this pressure washer,"This pressure washer got great review from Money magazine for its cleaning power, not its durability or reliability. Mine quit working after 15 or so uses (2 deck cleaning and the rest is just car wash). Worse, as some other reviewers have experienced, there's no part. Even their own service center said - throw it away, get a new one. I called the company and it looked like this is common problem. They may still work out some deals for you even if it already exceeds warranty.Why would you want to spend $200+ on machine that doesn't last more than 2 years. I'm very disappointed with this product. It would be cheaper to just pay someone to wash my car."
1,Garbage - Avoid company altogether,"Like the others, I had issues within an hour out of box. My big peeve was that it wouldn't draw the cleanser from the ""double tanks."" But it leaked pretty good.Poor spray pattern and difficult to maintain consistent results."
2,"Good Image for HD, Not for SD, Poor Audio","Samsung image quality for HD sources is very good. The design of the display is nice. However, standard def. does not look very good, thereis glow at the top and bottom from the backlight that is very obvious inblacks. The display takes a long time to power up, unlike any Sharp AquosI've owned. The audio is terrible, worse than any cheap little CRT displayI've heard. I think I will stick with Sharp for small LCD screens."
3,small band of white haze at the top of screen,"Excellent tv for the most part, but the slight white haze at the very top of the picture is annoying. It's not that way on floor models in stores; I've seen them in Circuit City and Best buy at numerous locations (albeit for $50-75 more plus tax) and they were all perfect. I even got one from Best Buy and took it home but it had the same problem that mine has. I am getting another one from Amazon any day now (I ordered both on the same day). I'll see if this one has the same problem and then I'll figure out what I can and can't live with. I only notice the haze when the image in the screen is dark and still....but I do notice it.By the way, unlike the other reviewer, I think I am able to dial in ""10.1"" by simply hitting ""1"",""0"", ""-"" and ""1"" on the remote.I'd give it 5 stars if not for the haze issue."
5,Television,"We enjoy the television. The picture is excellent. The sound is outstanding and is a strong advantage over other ""competitively priced"" televisions."
4,Samsung LNT1953H 19-Inch LCD HDTV,"This TV was a gift and it was well received. It looks great, great audio and video."
1,BUYER BEWARE- Please read this review,"This one of my nostalgic favourite films and I was delighted when I found it on American Amazon. I read Chuck Snow's review (and added grateful comments) and also Music Man's comments on Robin Summers review (where he does NOT mention any problem), but I thought oh time has passed, a faulty couple of DVD's - what are the chances? THE CHANCES ARE BAD. I watched my DVD last night - lovely B/W scope - and - It froze at exactly the 57' mark and nothing I could do made it work (My copy doesn't have chapters so I couldn't go beyond that 57' point. So...Just be warned...and one last question please - Can I ask if Robin Simmons bought and watched the same Sony/Columbia DVD? I really would like to know whether Chuck/Music Man/Me were just unlucky....Calm now, and many thanks Robin if you do read this I'd love your thoughts."
2,Forget the Time,"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of ""Voyage to the Earth's Core"" and ""Mysterious Island"". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ""Ogar"" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left is open for further rehashing of the same effects in ""People that Time Forgot"". Don't waste your time."
5,A delightful joining of baby's developments and spirituality,"I enjoyed the spiritual reflections of each monthly development as the baby grows. I used this book every month to see what to expect and to find a new way to look at our baby's changes and growth. It reminds us to admire the baby and God's gift. Although, she touches on a couple developments for each month, this is not a technical parenting book. Instead, it is a relaxing, reflection to enjoy what God has brought to your life through a child. Dr. Parish is also our pediatrician and truly respects and cares for children, which is exemplified in her conversations with the child more than the parent!"
3,Blues Masters: The Very Best of Lightnin' Hopkins,"i thought that the cd was no better than ok. if you've never heard lightnin' sam, it will expose you to his work but i thought the selection was mediocre and the quality of the recordings was average to poor."
5,New balance MR859,"I always buy New Balance, these are by far the best I bought. Even went back for another pair."
2,Good Quality Poor Fit,"I run four to six miles per day and having been wearing New Balance shoes for years. I haven't found any other brand that works as well for me. The price on these shoes was excellent; the quality is excellent; however, the fit is not consistent with previous New Balance models--the toe fit is shorter and wider than the 768 series (I have three pairs of these.) and the earlier 765 and 766. Additionally, I can feel what appears to be the gaps in the tread through the soles of the shoe, giving the impression that my feet are not on a uniform platform of support. While I have only worn them once, at this point in my experience, I am reluctant to recommend them, despite the great price."
5,The legendaries Bill Cullen and Bob Barker,"This 26 episode DVD of The Price Is Right brings back plenty of memories of Bob Barker who hosted it for 35 years on CBS. He was a master of those pricing games, showcases and showcase showdowns. I am starting to view those early 30 minute episodes of 1972 thru 1975. Those 4 older Bill Cullen episodes are a special terrific treat, because I was not around when Cullen's version aired and enjoy watching those vintage shows as well. I hope Mill Creek who took over from BCI puts together a 2nd Edition Best of Price Is Right that I hope will include episodes from the late 70's, 80's, 90's and between 2000-2007 along with some more of the early 1970's shows, including the 3 classic TPIR shows that CBS aired in 1998, 2000 and 2002."
5,Great for REAL Price is Right fan!,"I was dissapointed in all of the negative reviews for this T.P.I.R. DVD set. If you are a true fan of T.P.I.R. with Bob Barker this is an unbeatable DVD set. This set has some great vintage Bob Barker episodes from the 70's and it was a lot of fun watching the old prizes, with the old prices!! Also as a bonus there were some episodes of the original Price is Right. But the greatest part of this set are that it includes the entire last week of The Price is Right with Bob Barker! You'll be able to enjoy watching the best gameshow host of all time Bob Barker hosting the greatest game show of all time The Price is Right for years to come. We can only hope that they release a volume 2!! Like I said, if you aren't a true fan then don't buy this. If you love Bob, and T.P.I.R. then you will LOVE this set!"
3,not bad,A yngwie cover band. He needs a singer with a distinctive voice and he needs a guitar sound all his own. All this european power metal sounds the same. This is better than most. But all the songs run together like one long song. His first two albums were much better. He gets more and more commercial and less interesting with each passing album.
2,"Hard To Follow, Tedious To Finish","This book is written in the point of view of 20 different people. Does that sound confusing? It was, at times. A few of the stories were brilliant. The majority were terrible."
3,"De Tomasso Pantera, Maserati Ghibili, Ferrari Daytona","I first saw this movie in 1981 on Night Owl Theater on WCIX in Miami hosted by Big Wilson who was a local radio and TV celebrity. The real stars in this film are the exotic cars of the era. DeTomasso Pantera, Ms. O'Neil drives a Maserati Ghibili roadster, among others. In General a nice late night movie for a cold or stormy night. Anyone who grew up in the Miami area in the 60's and 70's should own the DVD to show their children what Miami looked like all those years ago"
1,horrible,"the cd was horrible, no good songs, a waste of money and a waste of time listening to this garbage, buy a cd where 2pac raps not this."
3,Not a bad album for a dead guy,"If your not a big fan of tupac's to begin with then this isn't the album for you. It's more for a true hardcore fan.Oh, I just read a review for this album by someone who stated that White America didn't understand him. Well, If it wasn't for White American male Teenagers from Suburbia buying his stuff Tupac and alot of other Hip Hop artists would never make it in the recording industry! So in my opinion Your Wrong. Bottom line: buy it if your a big fan of his."
5,These boots are great,"These boots really are great. I have owned six pairs of these boots. There have been only two reasons I have needed to buy new boots: growing and my stinky feet. These boots are a great deal at [...] bucks, but for the Amazon price (about 80 when I bought my newest pair) they are a steal. I really do hope that Harley doesn't stop making these boots just because they are so comfortable that I wear them every day, yet the boots are simplistic (not flashy like other Harley boots) that I shine them up for formal events."
5,Chicks Really do Dig them,"A few days agoI was doing the was at the laundry mat when this girl I was checking out saw I was folding these briefs. I like to wear them when I work out, otherwise I usually wear boxers. When she saw them she said, ""not too many guys wear the tighty whities any more...I wish more did, I think they are hot."" So I have made the switch full time. Wish they made these in a low-rise."
4,Great Purchase! Met expectations!,It is very hard to find XXL in the stores so I was pleased to find it available online at a good price. My husband is pleased with the purchase.
2,Just Okay,"We bought these briefs because we wanted a ""regular"" cut breif. All the ones today seem to be low-rise, which my husband finds uncomfortable. While the cut is fine, the quality is very poor, The fabric is a coarse cotton the feels really rough, and the assembly of the briefs is shoddy. Several pairs have mis-matched ealstic at the back. One even makes my husband feel that it is ""cutting"" him in the back. We were disappointed because we remember Fruit of the Loom quality from years ago. Well, it isn't that great any more."
5,Well Made,Well made and easy to use. Would love to see other seasons' represented in these type of cutters.
3,Better than it needed to be,"Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) continues to struggle with his inner demons in this film, set only a few weeks after the conclusion of ""Psycho II."" New visitors to the Bates motel include a suicidal ex-nun (Diana Scarwid), a sinister musician (Jeff Fahey), an investigative reporter (Roberta Maxwell), and a horde of rowdy party-goers. Perkins's performance as Bates is always the best reason to watch any of the ""Psycho"" sequels, and in this one he steps behind the camera as well. He does a good job. There is a sense of atmosphere and a nightmarish frenzy to several sequences that places it several notches above the previous film. The script (by Charles Edward Pogue) is better, too, although these continuations continue to make the mistake of trying to ""deepen"" Bates's character by giving him a more convoluted backstory. (Wait, his aunt loved his father who married his mother so he got kidnapped, then someone got murdered...)"
2,A rather ordinary book about extraordinary events.,"The twins of the title become orphans, are separated, and one grows up Dutch, the other remains German. They have some abortive contacts, and finally meet, by coincidence, as old women taking the baths in SPA, Belgium. Most of the book consists of their account of their lives, with their lives post WWII treated cursorily (well the German goes a few years past the War). The salient point is that the Dutch woman cannot forgive the German for being a German. She does at the end, but the whole account of their interaction in SPA is very weak. De Loo has definite narrative skill, so the book is readable. What I found particularly strange, is that the author seems to go out of her way to make the discovery of the two earlier visits between the two twins surprises to the reader, for no apparent reason, and to the detriment of the integrity of the story."
1,Zero Stars,What a stupid book. Believe in God and everything will work out. Get a life! Don't waste your precious time!
2,Disapointing scholarship but interesting story,"As a ""roots"" like story of a family's rise from slavery to the present day, this book is a pleasant read. However, for elucidating any ties to Thomas Jefferson, it is a tremendous disappointment. Having been greatly impressed by the poise, strength of character, and intelligence of Robert Cooley, the father one of the authors, I always hoped that his boast of being decended from Thomas Jefferson was true. However, the historic record left me in doubt. I bought ""A President in the Family"" with hopes that reading the Woodson family story would dispel some of that doubt, providing substance to the strong oral history. Sadly, I have been left hanging."
1,DVD didn't work,I am sure my kids would have loved this DVD had it worked... Not worth returning and losing my time... Packaging was cheap looking and DVD was not an original
2,Repeated Information,"I had nearly all the contents in various other books on faeries. For other people just into this subject, it would be a good book. Besides, faeries don't pose for pictures and they aren't that big in size. It what the author says is true, it would be a major news story around the world and on the websites where there are over 151,000 web sites on this subject."
1,sometimes bad is bad,It is a low quality map with few details and I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,It Had It's Moments,"This album is okay. I don't like as many songs on this one as I like on his other two cd's. I wasn't really feelin this one too much. The songs I do like are:1 Right Now - a good slow jam2 Playing Games - this is a cool song3 Natalie - my favorite song12 i'll Never Hurt You Again - i really liked this one too13 Papes In The Rnd - this is a tight song, didn't know Al could rap. He was tight.Tasha"
3,Elliot-Surf/Spy-Ness,"Sounding like the misbegotten child of SHADOWY MEN ON A SHADOWY PLANET and MAN OR ASTROMAN, J.A.T.S. should best be listened to while wearing a camouflage wetsuit whilst surfing the coast of Monster Island...and that's a huge compliment. I mean it."
1,Avoid this one!,"First one lasted about four hours, then the recoil starter broke. Returnd for replacement. Second unit lasted longer- about five hours- starter broken again. I took the unit apart to try to fix it and found the starting ratchet was cheap plastic; no wonder it failed. Took it back, got refund and bought a Stihl, which cost more but hasn't missed a lick in 9 months. Oh, and the Stihl actually starts in less than twenty pulls. Imagine that."
1,Disappointment,"This was the most disappointing of the series. There were only 11 shows, only the last cd had outtakes and no interviews. Although the shows were good, as they always are, it was too much money for too few laughs."
4,Funny the series dosent get old but this dvd set sucks for special features,"First thing where are the specila features this set scuks with no bonous stuff. The series starts it's third season and it dosent get old. The acting is great espesailly from Jack and Karen and Will and Grace become more independet and start to grow up. This year had guest stars like Cher, Ellen Degeneruous, Greggory Hines. The story's are great and the show become more populor."
5,Will and Grace,"Excellent, funny, laugh out loud....any fans of Will and Grace will love having this set."
3,"I really enjoy Peter Biddlecombe's work, but...","Peter Biddlecome's style is rare among travel writers. As a ""business traveler"" his perspective is unique and his insights are very entertaining. The more he writes, however, the less I enjoy his writing. He complains more and more and his work takes on a whiney tone; he makes me wonder if he still enjoys travel. His escapades are still entertaining, but not worthy of his earlier books."
1,I Cringed a lot,"I wanted to like this movie as I love romantic comedies.... but the slap-stick humor in this was too much for me to take. It's one thing for him to walk into a pole when he's watching her, but then in the same scene to fall down the stairs...oh, it was hard to watch."
4,Really fast shipping!,I bought this for my sister who lives in NYC and I live in the south and it was on her doorstep no more than 3 days after I purchased it. I paid for regular shipping and expected about 7-14 business days. Great!
3,Cute.,"It's cute, just what you'd expect. It's not anything memorable or edifying, or even super funny or romantic. Just nice for a night in, when you want to unwind."
4,Romantic comedy full of laughs!,"Beth (Kristen Bell) is a N.Y. curator who takes a trip to Rome for her sister's wedding, when she finds herself plucking coins from the Fontana de Amore, magically igniting passions of some comically unsuitable suitors! She then becomes quite taken with a charming reporter (Josh Duhamel) but is not sure if she's head-over-heels for him because she has his coin or because of real fate! Star cast also includes Danny Devito & Angelica Huston among others! There is a really hysterically funny scene of 5 people crammed into one of those little clown cars you see at the circus; wait until you see where this car can fit! May seem silly to some, but when you're feeling down or blue, this movie will be a real pick-u-upper!"
2,All-in-One is NOT really all you need!,"I wrote the CISSP exam recently and at least 40% of the exam was not covered or not covered in enough detail by this book. Not sure if the exam questions recently changed. But if your goal is the pass the exam, this book will not do it alone. I'm very disappointed."
5,Great Study resource,"I just passed the test. I used the Passport, this book, and the Official Guide to the (ISC)2 CBK to study along with practice tests, etc. I thought this was the best study guide out of them. The CBK guide gives more information on the various topics but this gives you a lot of the information you need and I would highly recommend anyone taking the exam to read this book. The Passport was also useful as a brief study guide. It gives a good overview to read first and to read through again to refresh for the test. The practice questions on the CD were also very helpful in preparation. I have never been disappointed with any of the books in the All in One series that i have read."
5,A very good prep book for the CISSP exam,"The book is definitely a good prep guide for the CISSP exam. Although hazy in some chapters, I found All-in-one particularly interesting and easy to read. Shon Harris presents the future exam taker with the perspective that he/she should adopt in order to pass the test something which is very important (the test questions are also quite good). Finally, it is a good reference as it provides a solid base over different areas of Security. However, remember that there is no All-in-one book for the CISSP exam. You should go over different reads while experience is also important. For those interested, I have managed to pass the test."
5,The Basic Book Needed for the CISSP Exam,"An excellent text for preparing for the exam and expanding your knowledge of the issues within the ten domains that it covers. It is thorough, well organized, easy to read, and offers simple explanations of technical issues. The sample questions and exercises are good, although the actual exam questions may be more complex. Support your study with Krutz and Vines's ""CISSP Prep Guide"", which covers the few gaps in this book and offers a bit more detail on some issues, but buy this book first."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON!,"My one-star rating does not reflect my rating of the book but, rather, my experience in purchasing this book through Amazon.com. Although it is listed as ""Third-Edition"" Amazon.com does not carry the 3rd Edition. I was sent the ""Second Edition"" and upon my complaint was notified the store does not carry the Third Edition. **Warning to those seeking the most recent information!**"
2,Be cautious,"The book was advertised as new and i paid for expedite shipment. But unfortunately, the book was delivered via regular shipment, the book was used (not new), and it did not contain the CD for the book.Nevertheless, when i returned the book, my money was refunded. Still, i lost time in waiting for the book, returning the book and getting my money back. And i even incurred shipping charges when i returned the book."
2,Disappointing,"The O'Henry story is wonderful, but this depiction doesn't do it justice. Perhaps, this is one of those stories that does not translate well to film. It seemed as though this was a production put on by a theater company in a small town. Also, be aware that running time for this video is just twenty minutes, which makes it a pretty expensive videotape."
4,Island of the Damned,"If you saw this as a kid, you always thought it was a classic. Although it doesn't hold up when one is an adult so much, it is still a decent flick to watch if you sprained your ankle and can't get out of the house. The plot concerns a stranded engineer (York) of a freighter that lands on a remote island that is inhabited by strange creatures. Lancaster is superb as the ingenious Dr Monreau who is a gifted geneticist and biologist who wants to merge animals with man to get the perfect creation that only science can manufacture. He is obviously a disciple of Nietzsche and Spencer. There is a creepiness about the island that the film manages to sustain throughout. The make-up is excellent and the beast men are rather frightening (not recommended for children under 7). Basheart plays the sayer of the law, who as an aged and wisdom filled creature whom attempts to dissuade complete anarchy amongst the beast men. Not a bad production."
3,A Comprehensive book,"This book is easy to read, with simple analysis strewn in between all the many contemporary examples, indicating the vast amount of research done on international security. It also covers all aspects of international security. There are clear headlines and subtitles which make it clear and neat.Though clearly lacking in references to classical theories and frameworks, it is ultimately a good book as an introduction to international security for beginners."
3,"great story poorly executed, and sadly, dated.","Meg is pregnant with her and Calvin's first child, Charles Wallace is fifteen, and the family is celebrating Thanksgiving when a call comes from the president to inform them that nuclear war is imminent. Charles Wallace must travel through time with a powerful unicorn, kything with Meg, and fixing the might-have-beens in Welsh and Native American history so that the right people are born. A fascinating and moving story, poorly executed with too many like-named characters, and convoluted, yet slow-paced plotting. Grade: B"
2,A Little Disappointed,"After reading A Wrinkle in Time as a child, I decided to read Tilting Planet... and I am very disappointed. The plot is too abstract and hard to follow, and I couldn't identify with any of the charachters. Also some of the coincidences were just too obvious."
2,A Bit Disapointed,"After A Wrinkle in Time I was a bit disapointed with this book. What ever happened to the Meg who went on adventures. Now all she is is a pregnant housewife while her husbant goes on to get a higher education. Shouldn't it be Meg getting that education? Besides that Charles Wallace is doing one thing or another to stop this dictator from taking over the world. It is all very hard to follow and there are so many characters it's hard to follow. I'm not saying it was a bad book, just not the kind that I was hoping it would be"
3,Say What???,"The book, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, was a fantastic book most of the time, but there were many places in the book where I was totally lost. Whenever she started talking about all the countries and all the evils of the people and all the people who were fighting so-and-so I had to reread that section a couple of times before I eventually got it. And it wasn't just one place it was a couple of places that this occurred."
5,Absolutely wonderful! I couldn't put it down!,"It is a wonderful edition to the series featuring many other books such as a Wrinkle in Time and Many Waters. I was completely intrigued just as everyone of Madeline L' Engle's books. The Murry family has found another major problem and hopefully, Charles-Wallace can help eveyone. With the complex plots and wonderfully crafted settings, Madeline L' Engle has completed another masterpiece!"
5,"A ""Timeless"" Classic","I have to say that this is by far the best of L'Engle's work. I personally feel that it even outstrips ""Wrinkle in Time"". Charles Wallace was always my favorite Murray, anyway. This book is a must-read."
1,this happened to me too,"wow! this happened to me too, I wont go into as many details as you, but she was a charlatan, went on the advice of a friend and she was off her rocker, nothing she said made sense or came true, never went back and my friend shortly after stopped seeing her too because she realized she could not predict anything, she was reading into everything, since she has looked far and wide and has yet to find ANYONE who truly can SEE ghosts or predict the future"
2,Latin Salsa,I give it two stars.It lacks anything to do with flamenco though.Salsa? I don't know.There are alot of directions in this CD. It is hard to enjoy it. I am sending my CD back for refund.
5,Don't let the group's name turn you off!,"I've been a fan of Texas ever since they were on guest spot on the ""TODAY SHOW"" back in the 80's. Of course that was the last time I ever saw them on TV. As the CDs were released, I'd by them; and each one turned out better than the one before. Then two years ago Air France featured them on a transatlantic flight and showed mega videos. That was the best entertainment. I felt like I was in heaven.All of their CDs, with the exception of this have been released in the USA. There have been some changes in the musical style; but this collection is nothing but pure magic.When this was released in Europe, I grabbed it as soon as it came out because the limited edition has an extra CD including 3 videos."
2,Just for the voice,"JUst for the voice..it sounds good, BUT IT NEVER GOT RID OF THE VOCALS. Even i changed it for another....it did the same. I'm keeping it because for my backing tracks my vouce sounds better. But dissapointed...."
2,a bit boring,I read about the movie so I decided to check it out. I was expecting to see one of the grossest movies of my life but it turned out to be just another cheap flick with bad acting. It moves along very slowly and you MIGHT be grossed out by a couple of badly done special effects. The scariest part was the rebirth of the demented DR. GIGGLES. ( what kind of name is that anyway? )
3,ok for the price,This filter works pretty good but it gets clogged up sometimes. Be sure and put the food in a bowl not just floating in the water.
5,Scenes from the city,"This book is a gem! If you a New Yorker, a movie enthusiast this is the perfect gift for yourself or your friends. Stunning images of New York from the some of the most incredible films ever made. I like to look at it and read over the various anecdotes on rainy afternoons and my friends worldwide have told me it was their best (and belated) Christmas gift ever."
3,"Cheaply made, but still cute","It doesn't really like to stay up on it's mushroom stem and it is pretty small, but it's still a mushroom house. How often do you see a mushroom house? I still think it's awesome."
5,George Re-born In Japan,"Jesus H. Krishna - where did this forgotten gem come from?From the high water mark of ""All Things Must Pass"" in 1970 that served as a compendium for all of his accumulating and unused Beatles-era work, George Harrison's more recent solo output has been at its best, spotty and at worst, downright desultory. Sharing the stage with Eric Clapton and taken from his last, very abbreviated, solo tour in 1991, Live In Japan (re-released after a ten year plus absence) brilliantly showcases a reinvigorated Harrison in top form - ripping through his Beatles and solo canon with a delicate ferocity that is both moving and completely unexpected.The Beatles chestnuts are all here however, it is on some of his lesser-known solo compositions that his enthusiasm for the material really shines - in particular ""Devil's Radio"" and ""Cheer Down."" The ""quiet"" Beatle delivers a landmark performance that is worth every penny."
5,Dark Horse Live,"Still waiting for the DVD of this concert.It was Georges' last tour and he pulled out all the stops with the aid of Eric Claptons' crack band. You get everything from Georges' Beatle classics (If I Needed Someone, Taxman, I Want to Tell You) to his solo efforts (Give Me Love, My Sweet Lord, Cheer Down) as well as a fine display of his standard tuned slide playing which has influenced and inspired countless guitar players from the 60s right up until today. George even throws in Chuck Berrys' Roll Over Beethoven at the end, a song that his son Dhani thought he wrote because it became such a signature song for Harrison"
4,Smooth Singer,"There is no smoother singer than Don Williams.Just like Kris Kristofferson, he has a smooth story-teller voice. Any of his CDs (so far) that I have , are great.You can even exercise to them !"
5,Delicious,"I am a mom of a VERY picky 7 year old...The first thing I made for her with the vegi burger was tacos....She now CRAVES these and asks for them at least once a week!...I don't even like to think about regular hamburger after using this product..(I am a regular meat eater)Sautee a finely chopped small onion in a large nonstick skillet..(no oil needed)Add 2tsp of minced garlic..stir for a minute...Add 3/4 of a reg. size can of diced tomatoes with the italian seasonings already added in the can...Add 1 can of LL burger..mix together...Add 1 1/4 package of your favorite taco seasoning..(we use taco bell orig.) and 1c water...Stir and cook until thickened...Mix in salt and pepper to taste..(I add the s and p when I add the meat, but this way you will get an idea of how much you'll need the next time)"
1,WARNING!!!,"THOSE OF YOU EXCPECTING REID'S SOUND FROM THE 60'S & 70'S,BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I PURCHASED THIS ALBUM BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD LUMPED IT IN WITH SEED OF MEMORY,RIVER,BANG BANG,SELF TITLED & LIVE AT THE ISLE OF WIGHT,WHICH ARE ALL EXCELLENT CLASSIC ROCK ALBUMS.THE DRIVER IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GENRE.I WOULD CALL IT A MIX OF DISCO & POP,NOT VERY GOOD WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT CLASSIC ROCK SOUND.KINDA FRUITY.SO TAKE THIS REVIEW FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,IF YOU'RE EXCPECTING CLASSIC ROCK YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE.IF YOU LIKE THE 80'S SOUND MIXED WITH A LITTLE DISCO,POP & NUTTINESS, THEN HEY THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU.IN MY OPINION THIS ALBUM IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A TERRY REID COLLECTION, GO WITH HIS EARLY WORK."
5,Stormy,"I thought Stormy was a really great book. The author Jim Kelgaard, has great techniques of writing ability.He explained with great details and adjectives. This is the kind of book that really puts a picture in your mind.Stormy is an adventurous book that touches your heart and lives with you forever."
3,This book is pretty good.,"I think this book is good, but it is definitely a little slow in the beginning. It gets pretty suspenseful in the end. I would only recommend it if you like real classics. Watership Down is in a real place, but it does not seem like it because the author uses very descriptive language. I think Richard Adams really knows how to make you use your imagination. I would recommend this book for eleven years old and up. Katie Lock, 5th grade"
1,An unpleasant aftertaste.,"A continuation from the utter delight that is the first book; how could it go wrong? I'm still baffled with just how wrong it went.The feel between the two books is the difference between fine spices and more salt on your fast food fries. The characters were flat and returning personalities were almost insultingly out of character. I felt myself ripped back from the pages on multiple occasions exclaiming 'That's not Fiver!'The book feels as though a list was created first of generic 'after school special' themes, then a story written forcibly around them. Rather than feeling a certain way about the issues, you are told to feel that way.I have a hard time accepting that this what even created by the same author.A note to those who loved the first:Just avoid it. Seeing more of their lives is enticing I know, but you'll wish you'd taken a skip at the end. My mind is still hitting ctrl-z for the last couple hours I spent with it."
3,Different,If you liked the theology and fables presented in the first book then you will love this book. I was looking for more of the first book so I was a bit disappointed to find what amounted to a book of short stories. The stories are entertaining and do fall in with the first book though.
1,Worst. Sequel. Ever.,"Unbelievably tedious PC hackwork -- I had just finished reading the original ""Watership Down"" out loud to my son when I read this and the contrast was horrifying. ""Watership Down"" is an all-time classic great novel, but ""Tales from Watership Down"" has absolutely none of the magic of its predecessor and is proof of a shocking decline in the author's powers (Richard Adams was born in 1920 and wrote ""Watership Down"" and several other good novels in the 1970's and 1980's, but in this 1996 work he is unrecognizable)."
5,More Watership Tales delight-,"Although not quite so mind-opening as the originaL WATERSHIP DOWN, this volume is charming in its own right. Do yourself the favor of reading it; you'll be glad!"
1,what a disappointment!,ok maby I am just a little confused? but didn't hazel die at the end of water ship down? there is no note saying that this book took place befor he died am I to think that rabbits cnn be reincarnated? this book is so differnt from the first maby there are to many rabbits or maby the few who whom we've grown to love arn't in the book as much maby there no big advencher like in the first book.I think that ritchard should of left well enough ALONE the whole felling I got from the first book is gone I don't believe I paid good money for this book my advice to all who want to read this book wait until it comes out in paper back and get from your library
5,Bugs Henderson and the Shuffle Kings-Live at the Granada,"I've been a Bugs fan for 15+ years and was unbelievably happy to see this DVD. Bugs pulls out all the tricks and shows how a blue player with 40+ years experience should play. He was hilarious with his funny stories and incredible with his playing. The band, as always, was awesome. I was truly impressed.The quality of the DVD was so well done and enjoyable. It has that raw feel of a blues show, but is done in a PBS-like quality that is very very well done. The shots are excellent and the sound is amazing. You're definitely going to want to crank up the volume on this one!"
4,Great! But no documentary film here!,"I loved this movie BUT...know that Frankie got famous at 13! 13 Folks! And died at 26! Soooo...as far as being factual...I don't know. Was he being molested (spell check) by today's standards? Poor guy! I love this music though and basically, who's the victim here, the Gold-diggers or minor, drug-addicted, where are his parents, ""Frankie""? Hmmm....enjoy it for what it is...fact plus Hollywood."
3,drugs can really damage someone's life....,"i'm not normaly get involved into the movie, ( mentally ), but this one really touch on something. mr Frankie, his songs, good, but i've not idea, how old he was or suppose to be in 1955? I asked some old record stores, 14 ? 15 ? how the held that a tennage got involved with three women at 15? 18 ? anyhow, who ever got involved with him, suck..but, the songs are gooddd"
1,DVD works better as a coaster,"I have been swing dancing for 2 years. I am by no means an excellent dancer but I can tell that he's doing IT WRONG!!! This is absolutely junk especially if you are new to swing. He's not even close to a professional swing dancer and he looks like a greaser. Searching youtube for ""lindy hop"" or ""swing dancing"" and you will learn so much more for free rather than waste your money."
2,Swing is the thing,"The dvd does what it promesses, however it was not quite satisfying to me. A bit too much show and too little dance technique is given what can be confusing the beginner. Remake this thing in a more professional way is my opinion,but it is of course usable for the dancer who just passed the beginner course and wants some more ideas on exhibiting the swing. But you have to learn with your eyes"
2,Not Funny!,I received the DVD as promised. But the comedians were not funny. I would not recommend this DVD.
1,WaterProof?????,"Looked great when I bought it, had high hopes. Moved from MA to NY in pretty good rain, opened up the bag and everything was soaked from the bottom up. Not sure if it was because the felt bottom was in contact with the roof of the car, but AMAZON said this was recommended with the roof rack I purchased. Terribly dissapointed, I hate writing bad reviews, but I bought this because it was supposed to be WATERPROOF. Wish I could return it."
1,WeatherTech RackSack,"I suggest you don't buy this item. I bought it about 2 weeks ago then went on a 800 mile trip to Colorado. The RackSack was easy to use but buy the time we got back it had basically come apart on the inside of the compartment. If you hit any wind at all the Sack also vibrates (the tie straps), you can help this by twisting the straps but it is still hard to keep all parts of it from flapping."
1,Not good Quality,This item did not live up to its description that I read when I purchased it. It is 5 -7 degrees off of correct tempature.
3,"difficult to get it up and running, slow to equilibrate","I read earlier reviews that explained how to avoid the ""freeze alert"". Even so I found it difficult to get the unit up and running. I had to take out the batteries and replace them in sequence several times. Part of the problem was that I didn't realize how slow both the indoor and outdoor units would be to equilibrate. However now everything is fine and I LOVE knowing the exterior temperature. The atomic clock kicked in after about 24 hours. My only current gripe is that the outdoor unit is supposedly not waterproof. What gives on that? The instructions say ""mount under eaves"" and also say ""face unit towards base station"" which are mutually incompatible. I have my outdoor unit sitting about 20 feet from the base station, and signalling through glass. Although it has gotten rained on it seems to be OK."
3,Pretty good,"I like the unit, but the outdoor sensors should be waterproofed.Also, the ice alert thing that beeps when the temperature is between 29 & 37 is about the worst idea they could have come up with. The winter in Chicago hits those numbers about 80% of the time. Very annoying. And even worse, you can't turn it off easily. The tip below about changing it to sensor 2 or 3 is the only way to go.Plus, c'mon, like we're not going to notice if it's cold or icy and need that beep anyway."
2,alarming,"Neither husband nor wife can shut off the darn alarm. Have tried - following the directions - multiple times, to no avail. If anyone has conquered this, please advise how to shut off (deactivate) the alarm. Thanks."
2,Did not work,The indoor temp works and the atomic clock works as expected. The remote does not work at all on any channel.
5,Great thermometer.,Always wanted one that was easy to read from across the room. Works very well if batteries are good. I would buy another of this brand.
3,Exterior Sensor Fail,"I like this product's functionality, but the remote sensor has failed in less than a year. Have contacted Oregon Scientific about warranty, but shouldn't need this hassle."
2,very disappointing,Bought three of these to replace my older working Oregon Scientific units that no longer have remote senors available.These units are a huge step backward in quality. It says these are good for remote sensing up to 100 feet but these units have been unable to sense the remotes that are no more than ten or fifteen feet away. Also they are very slow to lock to the time signal. Oregon Scientific really let the ball drop on this one as my older units still work where these don't.
1,UPATED TO NEGATIVE DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"UPDATE! THIS THING IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. IT IS CONSTANTLY SOUNDING AN ALARM AND I CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT TO STOP. I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS TO DEACTIVATE .... THEN A FEW DAYS/WEEKS LATER IT JUST GOES OFF AND I CAN'T STOP IT.DON'T BUY THIS ONE. STICK WITH LaCross.Pretty Good .... For the price $10 it is absolutely worth the priceThe only con, is it seems to have a slightly shorter range for the outdoor sensor to be picked up by the main unit."
2,Far from best in class.,"This clock has a readable display in a nice size with the key info I want--time, indoor and outdoor temperatures. I am disappointed in several features and wish that I had purchased a La Cross product instead. Disappointments include:Does not update time overnight even though located in a place where a previous La Crosse clock updated regularlyOutdoor temperature probe needs to be much closer to get regular signals than desirable.Has an annoying freezing temperature alert alarm that I had not figured out how to silence that does not quit after one or two tries so required getting up in the middle of the night to silence!"
3,It's Just OK.,"It was difficult to set up in the beginning. If you live in a climate where there are freezing temperatures, you don't want to hear the constant beeping about it. You get around the beeps by changing the channel, but doing so was not explained very well in the instructions. Also, for temperatures below freezing they recommend a lithium battery in the outside unit. The outside unit must be placed out of the sunlight, and out of the rain. I was much happier with my old Radio Shack unit."
1,Did not recieve. Sent email inquiry.,"Tracking data showed should have been received by 11-3-10. Sent email quiery on 11-23-10. No reply yet. Very unhappy. Sincerely, Patricia Bardwell"
2,you get what you pay for....,"I ordered 3 of these as gifts... only one works only as an issue to argue about as in ""THAT CANT BE RIGHT"" The clock does work.RE"
2,"Nice, as long as you don't have to change batteries","I like the design and layout of this item, but getting it to work after installing fresh batteries is a mystery. Every time I put fresh batteries in, it just doesn't seem to want to power up. If any of the LCD display activates, it's just random segments, and they won't stay on. I have to fiddle with it, try different batteries, take them out, put them back in, press the reset... nothing seems to work, until suddenly, maybe, it starts working. At this moment it is in this state, and I have no idea if, or when, it will start working again.I do not recommend buying this product."
1,Most horrendously stinky conditioner EVER!!!,"As a conditioner, eh, it's okay. And I'm glad it's paraben-free. But imagine the most hideous, Disco-Stu, covered in cheap man's cologne, shirt open to their navel with gold medallions.Yeah, that's what it smells like."
4,Lucy as a dramatic actress!,"This is a wonderful movie if you are interested in seeing a different side of Lucille Ball. She is absolutely wonderful, yet there is not a single thing funny about her character. She is cold, mean, and stubborn...but Lucy potrays the character brilliantly. you can truly see her talent as a dramatic actress in this movie. It's a tear jerker and a must for all Lucy fans."
5,Another great album,"I've listened to a lot of stuff by the SNZ, and I have I say this is another I can highly recommend. You have upbeat big band songs, and the more small-band type stuff with Katharine Whalen busting out the vocals.If you're new to SNZ but like other retro big band type bands, this album is definitely worth getting."
4,Loved it!,i bought it for my 6 month old son; he loved it! He liked holding it while it vibrated and after a while he figured out how to push the button and make it meow/vibrate himself! He loves kitties.
3,Not interested at all!,My son got this when he was 12 months old. He wouldn't even give it a second glance. I've tried introducing it since then and got the same reaction. He just has no interest in it.
2,Just plain boring!,"And a waste of money! My daughter got this as a gift at 6 months, and was not impressed by it at all, but did find my dogs reaction to the toy quite funny. This is a annoying repetive toy, one with little value as either a plaything or any educational value. I tossed it after it had collected dust for the last few months, my advice is, don't bother, get a set of the peek a blocks instead, your baby and you will have much more fun!"
4,For Holly Dunn Fans,"There is nothing extraordinary on this album, just pleasant country music of the type one usually expects from Holly Dunn. Her fans will surely enjoy this CD which contains the following tracks:1. No Love Have I2. If Your Heart Can't Do The Talking3. Golden Years4. You Say You Will5. I Laughed Until I Cried6. As Long As You Belong To Me7. Let Go8. I've Heard It All9. Half A Million Teardrops10. You Can Have Him11. A Simple I Love You"
2,Very odd concept,"The present conservative party, under George W. Bush, embraces bigotry, hate, and discrimination. Look at how they have treated Arabs, GLBTI minorities, and atheists and other non-Christians. It seems odd that after the persecution of Jews by Germans in the Twentieth Century and persecutions elsewhere, that they should embrace a party that persecutes other minorities. The conservatives also support the idea that the USA should be Christian country. All other people are not taken seriously and are generally shunned from the party."
1,the earthling,"This is a great movie, altho i would not recomend this movie produced by ""goodtimes"" productions they do not do the movie justice. i purchused a copy and i mean (a copy) the picture was grainy and poor sound reproduction, some parts even being blocked out by stactic. i would rate this movie a (five) but the recording,a(one)."
5,Great Survivor Movie,"With stunning cinematography and rich characters, this movie has it all. You will enjoy William Holden in his last role, and of course Ricky Shroder before he gained fame in later roles. Thoroughly enjoyable family movie."
1,wow,This movie was great! I realy injoyed it becuse it was realy intiresting and cool! I liked it alot! I am going to wach it again somday and I will still licke it!
3,For Diehard Fans Only,"The title track has been a favorite of mine since it led Billboard's top 40 back in 1979. However, I was rather disappointed by this release, particularly the instrumental version where they simply stripped out Joli's vocal and left the remaining vocals, leaving a hollow rendition rather than a decent instrumental. I'd suggest the Greatest Hits release instead. But if your heart is set on this one, shop around. (I didn't, or would have noticed that ..... has this release priced at $$$$ vs. the $$$$$ Amazon rate. If you're going to buy, go for the bargain."
4,live versions,"after reading all these reviews, i find it odd no one mentions that they are ""live"" versions, not studio ones----- im a huge joli fan----i think shes one of the most underreated singers from the disco era......her new track ""Halleleujah"" is outstanding..."
4,women that roar!!!!!!,"Whenever I feel annoyed or disgusted at the world around me, I enjoy blasting this CD on my stereo set or car radio to get rid of the demons that try to capture my conscience. These women seem to get into my soul and lift me into a floating world even though the music is not intended to be meditational. I enjoy women who do not hold back in music, and for something as rough as hard rock this group does not try to encompass the stereotype of which the world holds toward women. They rock harder than most male groups and behind the noise lies rhythmic control, and I am a fan of drum 'n' bass, Miami bass, hip hop, and soul so I can feel the patterns of which they convey within their sound. Blast this for an early morning rush or after a hard day at work, I guarantee you will feel good about it if you are a fan of good rock music.i.e.: also check L7 and The Slits..... Brett M. Hutcheson/ Pinniped Psyence..."
3,missing words,"where are the words ""Podemos"" and ""Entiendo"" in the Spanish part of the Dictionary?Also the English part of the dictionary gives pronounciation, but the Spanish part does not."
1,Cumbersome and hard to use,Got this for my friend who barely used it. Takes forever to find the word Not easy as some letters are pronounced differently -- so very hard to look up
4,Product does NOT match the product photo,The cable works fine but the product I got did NOT match the product photo.(Clear cable with gold plated pins)
4,"Works, but different than picture","I got this cable because my new laptop only has a 4-pin FireWire jack, while my backup hard drives have 6-pins. The cable was shipped quickly and works perfectly. But it is plain black, rather than the see-through silver/white pictured. Not that it makes a difference, but it was a little weird. Overall, a great product and great service."
1,It broke,"I had this for about 8 months and used it less than a dozen times, and it just stopped working. F you Sony and your ridiculous, expensive repair policies."
4,Great Camcorder but ahead of technology,"I am very happy with the camera results but it seems it is ahead of technology. Today with AVCHD format there are not many DVD payers to play DVD output in HD - it's only Blueray($500+) from Sony. For now, I am storing the video file in a NAS drive hoping to see a sub 4100 DVD player in the future to play AVCHD format. To view in a normal DVD player, supplied software converts to MPEG 2- but it makes the picture to SD.Battery life is average. Still pictures are better than any other handycam/Camcorder but can't beat any standard standalone digital camera.All in all, its good product but you should be aware for AVCHD limitations in terms of playing on a normal DVD player.Amazon did a good job in shipping as always."
3,Eh...Could have been better...,"No, this movie is not ""da dopest car movie evah"" or anything like that. I am a huge fan of films about Black-America, being that some of my favorites are Menace, Boyz, Lean on me, and many more. However, Let's be honest, there is nothing that is that great about this movie. It doesn't have much of a plot that will really hold you down and make you want to watch, and the acting is, average at best. I will say though that the acting of the police officers is horrible.This movie could have been something much more, had they tried to make you want to watch it for more than what it is, just people stealing cars. I doubt many people will see this film that live outside of New Jersey, but it is an accurate portrayal of life in Newark, so for that I commend it. But if you want to see a great movie, I suggest looking elsewhere. If you are just in the mood to watch cars being stolen and enjoy the action, then this movie might be for you."
3,"Interesting. However, the author has left Eckankar","The book gives interesting experiences that the author had on inner travels. However, the author ""now"" no longer gives recognition to the Mahanta for these experiences. We are our own Master or Mahanta. Comments are made to this fact on the Higher Consciousness website of Ford Johnson's. I find it interesting that Eckankar decided to do another printing of this book after the author resigned his Eckankar membership. Therefore, the subject matter in this book must come under question. I have no doubt of the inner experiences, but I (and the author) now understand that it was not the L.E.M. or Mahanta or other imagined Eck masters. Spirit works in mysterious ways, but Truth is utimately revealed. Read the author's own words on this subject on the Higher Consciousness website.The blessings of Spirit are always with you."
4,memories,"Growing up my Dad would change the names of the characters to the names of his four daughters... it was morbid and scary but, boy did it staywith us! I was ecstactic when I found the books again!87"
2,The King and Laura Petrie? Don't waste your time!,"Whoever came up with this lame contrived story and thought it would be good?Enter Elvis as inner-city free-clinic MD takin' care of business and gettin' All Shook Up over Mary Tyler Moore: coy rent-a-nurse-by-day, secretly a bride of Christ by night.The sexual tension is palpable. You know their 'romance' is doomed. She wants The King, but she's already Promised to Another.We're also cruelly tantalized by the lovely Barbara McNair as--you guessed it--Mary's foxy-nun nurse-buddy, Sister Irene. None of the Sisters at MY Catholic school looked as good as these two.There aren't even any good songs in this Hound Dog of a movie. I don't remember ""Rubberneckin'"", but I'm sure the Elvis fans do. ""Change of Habit"", ""Have a Happy"", ""Let Us Pray""----Presley chartbusters one and all."
1,CHANGE OF ...,"AS PRESLEY ENDS HIS ACTING CAREER IT IS FOR CERTAIN THAT ONLY PRESLEY FANS LIKE I WOULD EVER WATCH THIS GARBAGE. REALLY NOT FOR A ""MOVIE BUFF"". THE FEW SONGS IN THE MOVIE SEEM TO BE JUST THROWN IN AS IF TO SAY, ""OH YEA THIS IS A PRESLEY MOVIE HUH?"" DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOUR A FAN."
4,"In his last film, he's Dr. Elvis.","Why would anybody not want to have a Dr. Elvis? I probably would. Here, Elvis is in a dramatic part as a doctor of a clinic in the slums. He has three new assistants which are nuns in disguise. Mary Tyler Moore is one of them, and she soon falls for the doctor. Elvis' character is stunned when she reaveals herself. At the end of the film, she is deciding who to go with: the church or the doctor, the church or the doctor. It keeps flashing on-screen: a crucifix, Elvis, a statue of Mary, Elvis. Elvis is in the church with the Mass beginning singing ""Let Us Pray"". After that, Elvis' movie career was through. Check this one out. You won't regret it."
5,Change of Habit,Rececived in a timely manner and in very good condition. I have an ever growing collection of Elvis movies and this is a great addition.
4,OH SO TRUE - OOOOOOOOH SO TRUE,"While reading this little book, I can't count the number of times I wanted to yell, ""THAT'S ME!"" The book brings humor on an ""ordeal"" - and oh, yes it's an ordeal! But it also lets you know that it is only life - learn to live with it -- but with a smile."
3,A Great Idea but...,My daughter got this as a christmas gift she is now 5 months. It's a great idea but they really need to change the age on it. The age range they give it is Birth and up. With the hard face and rattle I wouldn't give it to her. Even now at 5 months she holds thing but everything goes right into her mouth. So lying on the floor this doll would smack right onto her face. We do hold it up for her and shake the rattle she loves that and she laughs. When she is lying on her stomach she'll try to chew on the doll sometime spitting up on it. The doll is suppose to be washable. I washed it once and now the rattle is filled with water. It's a cute doll but not recommended for the age range they give it.
3,ORPHEUS DESCENDING,"One of the last disaster movies of the 70s, METEOR is not the best of the lot, but it's an okay escapist film. A large asteroid called Orpheus is doomed to hit the earth unless a secret nuclear missile satellite named Hercules is aimed at it. The matter is complicated when it is decided the Russians' own system, Peter the Great, must be used in conjunction to stop the disaster.With average effects for its time, METEOR works best, ironically, when the ""splinters"" from the meteor crash into the Swiss Alps, Hong Kong and New York itself. The storyline is rather pedestrian, and Ronald Neame's direction isn't as tight as it was when the did THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. The cast is pretty standard, with no true outstanding performances: Sean Connery, Natalie Wood, Brian Keith, Martin Landau, Karl Malden, Henry Fonda, Trevor Howard and Richard Dysart.We've come a long way since 1979 but this movie is an okay viewing."
3,Meteor,I cannot se the the film on my DVD-player becauce I live in another region than the product is made for. So I can not buy normal DVD film from Amazon. I Haven't seen the film.Kindly John Srensen
5,An All Star Extravaganza!,"Directed by Ronald Neame, a master of disaster films also responsible for the ""Poseidon Adventure"", Meteor offers action- packed entertainment & state-of-the-art special effects that include an avalanche in the Swiss Alps & a tidal wave in Hong Kong. Sean Connery is daring & Natalie Wood is great, so is the whole cast... Although this movie was a late entry in the Disaster film era in the 70's it still has great moments and remains a classic!"
3,"Better than Deep Impact, less noise than Armageddon","This is one of those movies that is a guilty pleasure, kind of like""The Neptune Factor"". Sure, it's bad. But that's half thefun!""Meteor"" is one of the very first space-baseddisaster films from the era of disaster films (Airport, ToweringInferno, Earthquake). The effects range from good (rockets launchedfrom orbiting platforms), to terrible (Skylab as a deep space probe,and a two-by-four building trying to pass as a skyscraper).One ofthe opening scenes, of a sailboat crossing a starfield, isinspired.Whereas Deep Impact had good effects, and Armageddon wasnothing but flash and NOISE, ""Meteor"" has a touch ofclass. This despite the bad acting and cheesy effects.Try this oneout. It's a fun watch!"
4,"An All-Star Cast, A Real Stinkaroo Screenplay-What a BLAST!!","What is the only Wood that doesn't float? Why Natile, of course. You think that joke is bad, just listen to the screenplay, the cheezy fake Russian accents (Oh, Brian Keith). Like ""Grease 2,"" you can't help but watch this train wreck. It is soooo bad it's actually entertaining. It's actually better than ""Armageddon"" and much less ridiculous than ""Deep Impact.""There is peril, romance, thrills, chills, and laughter abound. Just accept this one as pure popcorn fun and enjoy."
3,A PRETTY GOOD SCI-FI FILM HOWEVER NOT THE BEST.,"I liked METEOR a lot SEAN CONNERY, NATALIE WOOD and HENRY FONDA good a good job with so-so diolouge and roles that they play who they play I won't give away just watch and find out and you'll see what I mean. Also I thought the effects were pretty good for back then wait till you see them but they're the only thing that save this film. I would reccomend this film for that reason nothing else."
1,Waste of Talent and a Waste of Time,"In American cinema history this is perhaps the worst waste of talent ever to hit the screen.The cast is overwhelmingly robust. However, the story, screenplay, direction,casting and effects are truely laughable. This is a huge film that doesnt even make a whimper. I encourage people to see it as a tribute to how bad a film can be made despite a wonderfully talented cast. I just sat and watched with my mouth open in shock."
1,Boring and dated,"Like the Pottery Barn catalogs, this book is boring and dated. The interiors have a depressing overall ""brown"" look to them also. The timing of the book is also odd because people are into their own style versus catalog style. Overlaying the Pottery Barn look (and it is ONE look) on an entire decorating book wasn't a good idea because there is a sameness of style or approach throughout the book. Get the free catalog instead of wasting your money on this. Companies that sell furniture should probably stay away from trying to create decorating books."
1,Yuk,"This has to be one of the most dull, drab decorating books ever. I bought several decorating books recently and shouldn't have gotten this one. It looks like they had a depressed decorator create all their rooms. It also looks too much like their catalogs. I should've known better."
4,Good book for Living room decoration,"A really workable guide book for living room decoration, including layout setup, room atmosphere with different color choice and light effect. Follow this guide, you can easily create a nice American style living room without trouble."
2,"Just OK, was great maybe 10 years ago","This kind of design was pretty hip about 10 years ago, but PB needs to freshen up their design.Their design style has infilrated into every middle-american household and is no longer unqiue.It's a mash up and old styles, contemporary, and bizarre museum-piece-like antiques (director's chair, old movie projector equipment??)It's played out. They need a revamp."
1,Disappointing,"The shed on the cover is the best one. If you want that specific one buy it, but if your looking for ideas find another book."
5,The Man Who Never Missed a Thing,As Mr. Lewyn's former Southern bartender I can attest without having read the book that Michael can suck up more facts and figures than a Hoover Upright! If he has cast his eye on Buffalo then nothing will be missing from this book. The man doesn't miss a thing! Though it will do me little good in Arkansas I will be purchasing this book in the near future to show off to Michael's former friends and associates. Keep up the good work Michael!
5,One on One.......Reminds me of New Orleans,One of my favorite all time cd's. I had the cassett back in the early 80's.These two were fated to get together as they meld so well. Smooth and sexy!
1,amongst the very best,i was so astonished when i first came to america to find out that not one single person knew about this good and outstanding group of artists.i absolutely love their music.
1,something wrong,"The table could not open properly. The legs were set, so that it was impossible to open. I believe there was a defect in the manufacturing of this product. I ordered 3 and All 3 were made the same wrong way."
3,If you're stuck on Panther and can't use Leopard get Tiger,"I have a lot of computers and the family pack is the only way to go. Tiger was a solid release, and it is what my main desktop is still running for development reasons. No complaints. Would like TimeMachine from Leopard though."
5,"Subtitle: ""Yuppies Discover Millionaire Next Door""","""Die Broke"" could be subtitled ""Yuppies Discover the Principles of the Millionaire Next Door."" After the first few chapters of self-aggrandizing puffery, Pollan provides more imaginative alternatives for estate planning than the usual ""we're spending our kid's inheritance"" or ""we're leaving it all to the kids."" Alas, some of the principles are merely the common sense already chronicled in ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" but perhaps the sense is not so common after all and warrants retelling. Round out ""Die"" and ""Millionaire"" with Barry Kaye's admittedly narrow and self-serving view of insurance in ""Investment Alternative"" and you'll have a perspective of estate planning beyond the one-dimensional world of wills and living trusts.Lee SwobodaP.S. I am not an employee of amazon.com and do not receive a commission for selling more books."
1,Forget it!,... Die Broke is a waste of money. The one single gem of good advice is to watch your spending. There is nothing sage in this book.
3,Good fundamentals - flawed vision...,"How do you believe someone who thinks the funnest thing you will be able to do at age 70 is be at a job? And just a money-generating job at that, not a career. Sorry but I have never had trouble finding better things to do with my time. On the other hand, the book's fundamentals are on target; take to frugality with religious zeal then let your investments earn for you later in life. Read the book, think about what it is advocating, but unless you're a complete idiot, don't buy into the whole program lock, stock, and barrel. You CAN think for yourself, too."
2,On the downward spiral,"This may be the worst album yet. I'm a Lenny fan and unless you've seen him live, you have no idea what a talent he is. After the disappointment from LENNY and hearing the first BORING single, I refused to buy this album. My girlfriend got it for free and I've given it a few spins.It's embarrassing to listen to. The overall sound is very canned and the lyrics are make the man a sitting duck for ridicule. ""Don't wanna a Rock Star!"". There is very little if any funk or variation from his standard sound. And it sounds MUCH more ""pop"" than any of his previous efforts."
2,Blah,"Not much here. A big disappointment. Drum tracks sound like a kid who knows a couple of beats practicing as the neighbors cring. No memorable songs. I actually was 90% of the way to flinging this out of my car window. Is he kidding or what with this. Guess one should bring the bong after the recording. Yeh, we know the routine Lenny. At best this is a Pro Tools recording demo. There are many better albums to buy right now unless you are a diehard Kravitz fan I cannot even fathom why you play this more than once."
2,"Only ""where are we Running"" is worth while","Maybe California is worthwhile... But other than that, thisalbum falls flat on it's face as has Lenny Kravitz career. Hejust had to cancel his tour because of poor attendence.And to that bimbo that said ""Stone Cold"" is dense,"" maybeyou should look in the mirror. Anybody that would call aHilliry Duff album a ""masterpiece"" has no creditibilitywhatsoever. She is a talentless hack that is a productof the tired MTV."
1,Are ya serious?!,"...since ""5""? Lenny Kravitz has never made a quality album! It's the most basic, simplistic songwriting outside of the teeny-bopper set (Britney Aguilera, Jessica Spears...whatever). If he made country music, he'd fit right in. But he doesn't. So he doesn't. It's music that has already been done since the beginning of time."
1,why,"why would anyone buy this guys albums? Grade: F for creativity, F for his Gap ads, F for everything he's ever done and someone please stop producing his music. please."
3,Uneven,"Simply put, Lenny Kravitz would do well to have stuck to what he does best: funky power rock combined with good songwriting. There are definate high spots on this album. ""Where Are We Runnin"", ""California"", and ""I Don't Wanna Be A Star"" are great rockin songs. However, the ballads on this album really seem out of place. Lenny Kravitz is NOT a balladier, and it shows.This is a worthwhile album for fans of Lenny Kravitz, but it is not by far his best work."
5,"The Minister Of Rock, Funk & Soul","Lenny's underrated as an artist and this is a masterpiece of songwriting, soul power, rock and roll, funky jams and soul baring emotion. Language is limited for reviewing great albums like this. Either you can connect with Lenny's music, or it's not your thing at all. Not every single tune is a gem (but most are) but the good ones are brilliant, concise, shining diamonds. Combining his obvious (so what?) influences of Sly Stone, Arthur Lee, Stevie Wonder, Led Zep, Kiss and The Stones with his own natural, inspired voice, tight musical chops, melodic flair, ""Baptism"" is classic Lenny all the way. Forget the critics and their ""retro"" label they give him, this album is a lesson on how to write good, memorable songs. Also, there's a great raw (Gibson Flying V) guitar tone on many of the up-tempo songs, that is great to hear. Lenny rocks- so get baptized already."
4,I really like it!,"I do see what the initial response to this new album is. I am a BIG Lenny fan dating back to 1989. I honestly enjoy this much more than the last two albums. While I do agree that this sadly does not compare with the first four albums Lenny released (Let Love Rule through Circus) this one certainly outshines the last two.The problem is that many people are comparing this release to his early releases. Lenny has a different sound now than he did earlier in his career. I don't think that it is a bad sound at all, just somewhat different.The first five songs here are absolutely outstanding. I do admit that some of the others are hit & miss, but some others are still good. Some will like this, others will not. At least give it a chance - maybe you will feel the same way that I do."
3,"Lenny, pretty good album","Good album, I'd actually say 3 1/2 stars. ""Minister of Rock and Roll"" and ""Sistamamalover"" are the best tunes. The music is better than the vocals. It isn't ""American Woman"" so to speak, but it is pretty decent."
3,Average,"The important information is that Dagar brothers have nothing to do with the current album. It is misleading and the two attached reviews don't help to dispel the myth.I found the album an average one, my frustration could contribute to a lesser score."
3,Life Sex and Death a hit an miss affair,"I remember getting this in 1992, I heard they were going to be the next big thing! from my local record clerk,well they did all right, but they weren't the next big thing. I will always remember ""Stanley"" the lead vocalist, what a strange looking dude!(Even though he was a good entertainer). They had some good songs, but also some duds.Here are the tracks that impressed me back then and are still good today: The hoedown of ""Farm Song"", ""Hey Buddy"",Raise A Little Hell"", ""Train"", ""School's For Fools"" and the song that says it all sometimes ""F.S.A."".LSD is hard rock, hair metal and acoustic."
4,Stanley Roolz and Droolz!,You have to got to hear this album. Their lead singer was a genuine retard (mental defective to be PC) but boy could he sing!
5,Loved this one.,What excitement. What adventure. An amazing recreation. George C. Scott played the part as the events may have actually happened.
3,Formulaic genre film,"This ""red-headed step child"" of the disaster genre will really only appeal to fans of the formula (like myself, I confess!), conspiracy theorists or aviation history buffs.Great stars are wasted in a historical fiction melodrama HEAVY on the fiction. William Atherton turns in the best performance as a Nazi resistance crew member, while everyone else hams it up admirably hoping to duplicate Shelley Winters's success in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.The last 15 minutes, however, are spectacularly well done by director Wise, Editor and the special effects department.Unfortunately, Universal missed the opportunity to include any interesting special features related to zeppelin travel, the Hindenberg catastrophe or the important, frenetic history of the time. Shame on them!"
2,"Just love everything about it, less the DVD itself","Just love everything about this movie.Robert Wise did a great job. Also, adapting one of the ideas around as the casue for the disaster and develop a movie around it was brilliant. Scott's performance is right on the spot, perfect.Technically, the movie is indeed very good, mainly if you consider when it was filmed (1975). The idea of merging real footage was also a winner.But (and that's a BIG BUT), I wonder who at Universal despised this movie so much as to give it this sh...t transference job to DVD or, apparently, to no no job transfer at all. Seldom have I seen such a bad image quality in a DVD from a movie that's not so particularly old. I was shocked when I saw all the grainy patches (and mt TV screen is just 32 inchs, not so big), the lack of any definition, well, a lot of people mentiond it here with more knowledge. It was a dissapointment.That's why the two stars review. Not for the movie, but for the DVD quality."
1,not a digital transfer,Horrible picture quality on large screen TVs. This is probably the worst picture quality since the DVD release of Bilitis.
1,"Great systems, but NOT WITH A 50% SHIPPING SURCHARGE","Yamaha systems have consistently led the Consumer Reports ratings for ""home theater in a box"" systems. But you must note that ordering this from Target results in a $242 shipping charge (check out verified 1-18-2007) ... that's roughly 48% of the cost of the system. Ridiculous, it then costs more than you'd pay locally. Inexcusable. Don't do it until Amazon/Target find a new pricing model."
4,Pretty Nice Home Theater,This was a great purchase. The sound quality is good and its system options fits my needs. The only thing is that the speaker wires are kind of thin. Thicker speaker wire would improve the sound even more...
5,Impressive,"The finish on my black 1994 Stealth had become dull and rough to the touch, with visible oxidization on all horizontal panels. Applying cleaner/wax made little difference. Convinced that the paint was shot and that only a respray would correct the problem, I tried this product as a last-ditch effort, and IT WORKED! It was easy to apply and I followed it up with a three-step cleaner, polish and wax to restore the body's original shine. Close inspection reveals water spots and imperfections, but one would not guess that the paint is 11 years old!<center></center>"
5,Cleans paint really well,I've used the Meguiars clay kit and liked it a lot but I think the Mothers kit is easier. The clay didn't stick to the clear coat as often as with the Meguirars and didn't require as much lubrication.
4,"Overall, satisified","My wife parked under a tree that left tiny sap particles all over the car (a 2011 VW Sportwagen). I've tried using mineral spirits which did nothing so I tried this. While it didn't make the car perfect, it made a very noticeable improvement. Had I not dropped one of the bars on the ground and immediately discarded it, I think I could have made an even better improvement. I was careful not to press too hard, but I did use some pressure. As others noted, this did cause some very faints scratches which were easily removed with wax."
2,If I had my money back,"I was not impressed with this kit. The clay is fantastic, but the detailed that is included just sucks.First, I had to use an entire bottle to keep the clay lubricated around my entire small car. The ad clearly states that this bottle will last ""many"" cars. No. Not if you don't want clay residue on your car.Next, after claying my car, the excess quick detailed dried. Oh no problem, instructions say you can clean with more detailer. WRONG. With tons of muscle and even more quick detailer, I was unable to clean the surface. I had to reach for my trusty 3M compound remover."
4,Looks great,"Have not used it yet, but wish it did not come with the clay bars...they just look like more work will be required."
4,"Maybe not his best, but ...","A lot of fans prefer status quo. Miles said in an interview that he hated doing is old stuff, so essentially all of his music was experimental; some worked, some less so. That said, this is an excellent album, regardless of whether it was supposed to be hip-hop or country western. The great thing about Miles Davis was that he had no use for boundaries. When people think of jazz, the name ""Miles"" always comes up because he embodied the very soul of jazz. I have been a fan of what I consider his post-fusion days of the late 1970s, so my favorite albums by Miles aren't always considered his best: ""Get up with It""; ""Siesta""; ""Directions""; and even his later ""Tutu."" Bottom line for me is this: so-called purists won't like any Miles Davis music performed after the early 1960s. ""Bitches Brew"" thrust him into a whole new realm of non-categories. ""Doo-Bop"" may not be Miles Davis' best music, but it's sure better than most of the MOR crap that passes for jazz these days."
2,Get another Miles album. This is purely second rate.,"Seems like Miles was reaching a bit on this one, and he should never have hooked up with this lame rapper (Easy Mo Be or some such); you'd think if he was gonna do this thing, he'd have found a unique rapper or one with a style that was less inane and brown-nosing to collaborate with. But a big part of it is probably that Miles died before the thing was even halfway finished, and this assclown got put in charge of the final mix and track selection, at which he is hopeless. And what the %$#*^% is with that title? When you mix Hip Hop with Be Bop, you get Be Hop or Hip Bop; seems Easy Mo Beeyotch got confused with Doo Wop. Sheesh.There's some mildly pleasant mixes with a good trumpet and some punchy backing tracks, but they're usually the ones with little vocalizing; when B steps in, it slides hard."
2,This album is a JOKE,this album is an absolute joke... HOW COULD THEY GET THE BEST JAZZ MUSICIAN IN THE WORLD TO DO HIPHOP? Rappers? RAPPERS????? Easy Moe Bee?? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS! I'm only giving it two stars becuase of miles's master trumpet solos. becuase this was poor miles last album... hope he won't be remembered for it. EVER HEARD OF KIND OF BLUE??? THE BEST JAZZ ALBUM IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC?? Apparently not...
5,Greatest Map Series,"The most annoying thing about maps is having to refold them, and heaven forbid they make you look like a tourist. With the Popout map series, the map is small enough to fit in your pocket and when you open it, it expands on it's own and folds back when you close it. Anytime I go to any major city I've never been to before, I buy a popout map before embarking. Can't say enough about them, just a darn good map! And as if that wasn't enough, Rand Mcnally goes on step further by offering a popout map with a compass and pen on the Deluxe Version."
4,Not Bad,"I love the picture quality. It's quite clear and sharp - better than more expensive webcams that I have seen. It isn't fuzzy in the slightest. However, when using it over the internet (as most folks do with webcams), the lag is rather bad. If you speak, for example, you'll see your lips move a good 30 seconds to a minute or so later. Though, it does come with this spiffy ""Orb"" feature. You can quite easily set it up so that you can see pictures on your webcam from any internet connected computer at any time, or set it to alert you via email if anything moves in the room it's in. Also, the little clip holds the webcam on a laptop quite securely, and though it doesn't turn left or right, you can easily place it left or right on the laptop. Overall, I'm quite pleased with it."
2,Don't waste your money,"Radio works ok if you don't like clear sound, and it stops playing cds after 2 weeks."
4,"Quiet, power and low emissions, some vibes","This unit has a ton of power, clutch to disconnect the head when idle, and lots of torque. It really goes, you don't need to rev it way up like a 2 stroke. The grass and plants fly when you get this sucker cutting. Dad and I both got one, we had 2strokes but like this unit better.Drawbacks - It does vibrate a bit and can cause your hand to go numb somewhat. Suggest mounting handle with inner tube rubber isolation."
4,Out of the new age....,"I've read some of the previous reviews that say that Sid Roth is a ""traitor Jew"", but I do not agree with that assessment. Sid Roth is a man who was deeply involved in the New Age movement and occult practices. This book details his search for ""something more."" He found that in Jesus, the Messiah.If you enjoy biographies of saints or other spiritual people you will enjoy this book. If you are involved in the occult or new age, and don't understand what we Christians have ""found"", you just might come to understand, reading this book."
2,i could not finsh it,i could not finsih this book because the author did not decribe autism weell at all.
4,"Good bit, handy","I'm a woodworker and I find having an 1/8 radius bit handy to knock the outside edges down on doors, face frames or molding. I like Freud's bits, they are very consistent, pretty reliable and durable. I don't give this bit 5 stars because I find 1/4"" shanks a pain to work with."
1,A great film in a terrible product,"I'm very disappointed with the quality of the DVD that the Amazon sold. Looks like a pirate one, starts by the cover, the box and the record's quality. As a product It's not worthy, although it is a great film."
2,Slow moving boring.,Don't waste your time. This movie is trash Amazon this is an insult.. Movies like this make me want to close my amazo prime account..
2,Disappointing!,I'm a fan of John Sanford's but I couldn't get started with this one. I'd not recommend it to other fans or new readers.
3,Sandford - The Devil's Code,"The Devil's Code is the third and latest installment in Sandford's LuEllen/Kidd series. While not as good or impressive as his Prey novels, Sandford delivers a strong and entertaining novel.Readers are treated to a fast-paced techno-thriller that doesn't seem nearly as dated as previous efforts. Yet little new information is revealed about our heroes. One of Sandford's most impressive talents with respect to the Prey novels is writing a back story just as engaging as the main body of the novel - familiar characters and places come back and are developed, issues and questions are resolved. Unfortunately this series just doesn't have that strength going for it.All-in-all, however, its an entertaining read."
5,Another Great Kidd Novel,"A great follow-up to The Fool's Run and The Empress file. If you like the other Kidd novels, then you'll be pleased with this one! If you have bever read Sandford's Kidd series, you'll enjoy a great, plot-twisting, suspenseful, technological thriller. Good technical details to keep the tech-at-heart interested and good stroyline / suspense to keep those that like surprises pleased. A quick, enjoyable read. Looking forward (hopefully) to the next Kidd novel."
3,Save your time and Money - Let this book go!,"Though the basic plot is good, its got many extraneous things that needn't have been there, it pretty much added nothing but pages to read and nothing to the plot or the scene.I think it could have been better laid out and presented, but if you're willing to live through that, it's a fairly decent story. If not, I'd skip this and move on to the next book!"
1,Worst book ever!,This was the worst book that I have ever read. The story was boring and hard to follow. The characters were not likable and the book was a chore to complete. Do not waste your time on this one!
2,Sorry John - Stick to the PREY,"I have read the Kidd novels just because I like the ""Prey"" Novels so much. But, for whatever reason they just don't work for me.Maybe, because I am in the computer profession myself. They just don't feel right. And I just don't care about the main characters."
2,I could say I liked it but I'd be kidding.,"I enjoy Sandford's prey books but have never read one of his Kidd novels. This is the first, and will be the last. The characters are so thinly developed that I could care for none of them...and so why invest time , energy and money into the book? Sandford could learn a few things from Michael Crichton in terms of building a storyline around a lot of technical information in such a way as to draw the reader in. This book misses it for me on all levels. I finished it because I kept waiting for the book to become a ""Sandford book"" so to speak...and it never did."
2,"Boring if you're a Computer Geek, Dreadful if You're Not!","I, too, cannot finish this book. It is extremely painful and a disappointment if you are a true ""Prey"" fan. Even the writing style does not seem part of John Sandford's repertorire. If this book is on the best seller list, it is simply resting on the laurels of the Sandford name. However, once word of mouth spreads, this book is history."
3,It wasn't The Hills Fault...,"Although I love The Hills and am pretty much obsessed with EVERY season (except after Lauren left...)-- I had to return this boxset to the seller (textbooksrus). I was impressed with the speedy delivery, however, Disc 1 of the 3-disc set was from SEASON 3 and NOT SEASON 4, as ordered. I popped in my new DVD, expecting to see the beginning of season 4, and felt myself having an incredibly amount of Deja vu... I actually already own Season 3, and I just had this uncanny feeling that there was a mistake. So, sadly-- b/c this company doesn't do exchanges or replacements, I'll have to re-purchase this boxset from someone else. I appreciate the no-hassle refund process, but it just is a hassle to send back a partial set & wait LONGER for my COMPLETE set-- when they could just as easily send me the missing disc-1 ... *sigh* But, I'll do it in order to complete my collection."
4,One of my FAVORITE reality shows,"I was so glad this came complete. I have been wanting to finish this series. I deployed right in the middle of it ending, so I was thrilled when I saw it come out on DVD. The seller got it to me on-time, and in great condition"
2,Someone Please Stop This Show Before It Reproduces Again!,"WHY did I BUY this? I used to love this show back when it was first on, and since I missed many episodes after that, I figured I'd buy a season, jump back in.Huge mistake.For The Hills it's past mercy killin' time, y'all..."
2,Didn't fit,It looks really sexy but damn it didn't fit. I'm 70 Kg just in case you are my weight you will know this won't fit.
5,The easy test,"It is very easy to tell whether you will like Lapsang Souchong. If you enjoy a good single malt, you'll love it. If you think drinking iodine would be preferable to Scotch, you'll hate it. Me? I love it!"
3,"A bit strong, but interesting",The smoky flavor is a nice change from normal floral teas. Blend with Assam or a mother tea of the smokiness is too strong.
2,Twinings Lapsang Souchong not that great,"For Lapsang Souchong, Twinings' version really isn't that good. The smokey essence is very artificial smelling. There are no ingredients listed on the box or any indication as to what they have used, but it smells like ""artificial smoke flavor"". VERY pungent odor before even opening the box, almost intolerable when steeping. Should be a softer smoke. Not as strong on the tongue but artificial smoke scent was unbearable. Sorry Twinings. I'd say spend a few bucks more and get a looseleaf variety instead. It'll be a much more ""real"" Lapsang Souchong experience."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This is the cheapest 35mm camera with a zoom lens and a flash that I could find, so I pretty much got what I expected: it feels cheap, and it takes just okay pictures. But you don't need to worry about breaking or losing it, and you save money versus disposable cameras as long as it lasts for at least four rolls -- plus you get a (tiny) zoom lens to boot."
3,Great Fit,This cover fit my cart perfectly but it was torn fairly easy by a co-worker. Treat it gently and it could last a couple of seasons.
3,"A bit slow and repetitive, but worthwhile","I'm in good shape, am pretty flexible and I have recently started doing yoga. I wanted something at the intermediate level that would challenge me a bit more than my beginner yoga tapes do. I enjoyed it somewhat but thought it moved too slowly. There was also more talking in this video than I would have liked. Kathy Smith has viewers repeat the same movements over several times. I guess this is good if you're learning but it can get boring if you know what you're doing. I'd rather mix up the movements a bit. It's a decent video, but I get just as much, if not more, out of Power Yoga for Beginners with Rodney Yee."
4,I fell asleep!,"I'm a beginner too and maybe I had a high expectation of what Yoga would be like... Well, it wasn't very difficult to follow although I wish they would show more of the modified easier versions more clearly and more frequently. It was very relaxing indeed and by the end of the breathing exercise, I fell asleep. I think it would be great to use it at night before going to sleep but for the morning? I don't know..."
2,It's not that good,I returned it. I found her instructions hard to follow while exercising. Didn't have very good flow from one part to another.
1,Uncomfortable and does not work as described,"The product is very large and uncomfortable. The air bladder adjustment system does not work at all. Seemed like a good idea, but is truly an over-engineered product. Stick with a normal pillow for under the knee support and you will be much happier."
2,Not what you hear in the movie,"If you are a relatively accomplished pianist and strive to play the original music form the movie then this is NOT the book for you. Almost every song is in a different key than from the movie and many of the songs that should be 8,9 and 10 pages long are only, at most, 4 pages. In other words, this book leaves out some of the best parts of the songs such as ""mess around"" and ""Georgia"". If you want to play the music like Ray did then you will be doing some MAJOR improvisations on these pieces. Don't waste your money on this half-hearted effort."
3,not very easy if you have never danced latin,"At first I was totally lost. I bought this DVD because I have other exercise DVD's from Kathy, but this time I was not very happy. It seems that Kathy lost her ability to guide you as you go along. It is like she is showing how good she can dance. She makes turns and steps not telling you when it will happen.I stayed with it for a few weeks only doing the first part and than moving on to the second. After a while it is possible to understand how it goes."
3,Video was a little disappointing,"I love Kathy Smith, but the first time I did this video, I didn't feel like it was much of a workout. The video is very very fast, but not terribly difficult. Honestly I found myself getting bored with the music. Maybe once I do it a few more times my opinion will change. I will always highly recommend her kickboxing video though."
1,Not That Great,"To those who are wondering if you should buy this vid or not. I read all the people's reviews on this site, and overall I had a good impression, so I bought this vid. But..... You know, when you buy any exercise vides, you think ""Right, I wanna get a bottom like hers, so I'll do the exercise she does and get a good body.""or something like that. You wouldn't wanna get a video of someone who's very ordinary, cause that wouldn't motivate you at all. From that point of view, Kathy is good, but other dancers, I didn't think they were good enough. I don't mean just the appearance, but also the way they dance. I'm not saying they were bad or anything, but I didn't find it amazing at all. No offence to some of you who love this video, but this wasn't for me."
5,A FUN WORKOUT!,"This video is so much fun to do! This is a video I can do without taking any water breaks 'cause it's just so much fun to do! The dances are easy to pick up, plus they're good to learn to do at any parties. Kathy gives good instruction, so it's very easy to keep up. Although I mention the word ""easy"" a couple of times, this workout is still very challenging. It gets your heart rate up, and you'll definitely break a sweat. But you'll be having so much fun, you won't even notice!"
3,Kathy doesn't know Latin,"I bought this video expecting to learn Latin dance and get a workout. I was disappointed on both. Although it is interesting because it is different from most videos its not very difficult aerobically and...... she's pretty clueless when it comes to the steps. She should have just stepped aside and let some of the other dancers lead that knew more than she did. At one point in the video she says ""look at Carla"" because she can't really do the steps.If you are looking for a minimal and fun workout that just keeps you moving this is it. If you are looking to learn to dance go elsewhere!"
4,Pleasant and entertaining,"This is a decent workout tape. It's not a cardio blaster tape, but it does get your HR up to that 60 - 80% range - if you use your arms and actually DANCE. Good for a low to medium intensity day. The music is good and I much prefer it to the techno-pop-elevator-music in many other tapes. I agree with the other reviewers - the cuing is variable Watch the co-leader, Clara - this is where I learned the most. Note: doing this tape in workout shoes on carpet will play havoc with your ankles - especially the merengue. Wear a set of smooth soled shoes (i.e., flats) or work out on a smooth surface. As weird as it feels to exercise in my work shoes, I actually had better results and a better time. Several friends have borrowed this tape and loved it - and their kids loved it too, dancing along with Mom."
2,I barely broke a sweat,"The Latin band and dancers were great fun, but I would recommend the video only to people who are brand new to working out and to dancing. I've got some experience and felt like I wasn't working at all. I went through the tape once and will give it away.Probably in an attempt to make the dance steps as easy as possible, Kathy Smith focuses for too long on each one. Each segment of the video uses just one step, which you do over and over with only minor variations. There's very little upper body involvement, so it's hard to increase the intensity unless you get pretty far from the basic choreography.If you're looking for a more involving Latin aerobics tape, I highly recommend Viva! Aerobics by Elise Foss. She uses many of the same basic steps but combines them in much more interesting ways, plus she involves the upper body and makes it easy to add intensity. She's also fun and engaging."
1,Scam!,"If you want to a) Have a good workout or b) Learn Latino dancing, please go elsewhere. 'Coz this video helps neither. The latino dancing steps are covered in 2-3 minutes and then you're off on your own to figure out how to synchronize yourself with the video. And the workout aspect of it is just a sham. If you already are a fluent latino dancer, you might get a kick out of this, 'coz the workout might warm you up just a little bit.I am looking for other videos for structured Latino dancing lessons and separate viedos for working out. It should be well worth the money since I love both dancing and working out....separately!"
2,Needs a better learn the moves section,"The camera person tried to be fancy and shoot lots of angles, some of which don't show the feet! During the no-feet sections I just stand and lose momentum. The dance steps are precise-- I'm not a natural dancer and I ended up shuffling around flat footed. I wished there was a section where I could do the moves slowly and gain the muscle memory necessary to execute the moves quickly. The moves involve a lot of stepping backwards and forwards with your knees turned in, be careful not to strain your knees."
2,"No, not as cool as I thought it would be....","I didn't really like this video. If you are somewhat athletic, this video would not even make you sweat much. It is some kind of BAD cardio workout, that doesn't target any specific muscles. Kathy is horrible with her instructions and changes them the last second. Had a feel that she is making them up as she goes. Plus, you won't be able to see their legs properly since all are wearing black pants when background is already dark. In other words, not worth spending money on this."
2,"If you never read the book - three stars, if you read the book...","zero stars.As a standalone B-movie, it's very mediocre, but watchable. Low expectations are richly rewarded here.If you read Wambaugh's book, you will loathe the movie because it betrays your hopes and expectations so badly. No wonder Wambaugh wanted to have his name removed from the credits. The movie tears all the flesh away from his excellent book and keeps just a few bones.If you have not read the book, but ""kinda"" liked the movie, read the book. You are in for a huge treat. If you read the book, but have not seen the movie, that's as far as you need go. Or read the book again."
5,"Nordic 9"" Springform Pan","Overall satisfied with the purchase. I bought this pan because of the attractive blue color, however, I received a maroon color pan instead. It's still pretty though. I baked a cheesecake using it, the sides turned out brown, i guess as mentioned by the others, it could probably be due to the white coating on the pan. Nevertheless, the cheesecake was still yummy!!"
4,Great Cookware!,"I received this fluted pan 3 years ago and was a little nervous about using it until today. I sprayed it with Pam and placed it on a cookie sheet and after letting my cake cool for 30 min., it just popped right out. This pan is a keeper."
2,"NewNovelist 2.0, is it really needed?","I'm an old amateur writer. I thought I wanted to write a novel. But when starting it, after awhile, I realized that most of what the software does, I could do on Word. I decided not to waste my senior years on a book and then not sell it.It's more fun and productive to try and produce short stories, articles and poems that magazines are willing to publish. The same thing can be done with or without the software; it just takes will power and structure, with persistence. The screen on the software I did not like. It was small and the words would cut off at the end, in other words the screen is too small. Yet I've read where some writers love it. So when I decide to sell it, I will, for half price. My wife bought it for me, so I have to have a time frame here before I try to sell it."
4,"Works, but check the bearing first","This worked really well, but the set screw on the bearing collar was not completely tight, or it came loose. In either case, I gouged my work because the bearing moved. No serious damage, but really scarred me, since my very light cut against the template that I was using became a rather deep and heavy cut. Things began to move fast.Morale of the story. Check the set-screw tightness, and even put some lock-tite on it to be sure. Do not know why Freud did not do this in the first place!!!!"
1,"Poor Quality, failed within 30 days","Fan was noisy and always had electrical smell, has now failed within 30 days of installing it. Putting original fan back in...at least it works but needs to be ""hit"" sometimes to make it start. This one seems to have burned out. NOT HAPPY. Apparently Amazon offers no warranty, not sure how to make a claim, nothing obvious in any of the documentation from Amazon OR manufacturer."
1,ANNOYED BY LASHONDRA,"I don't know about everyone else but I'm getting tired of the black ""sista"" routine. It gets old fast. All minorities have experienced racism, but Lashondra takes it to another level. Not all black women are soulful, eye rolling, hand on the hip preaching to anyone who will listen or care. I couldn't stand her character and I don't understand why anyone like Stelson would want to be with someone who has a chip the size of the universe on her shoulder."
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK! EXCELLENT NOVEL!,"This book deserves 10 stars. Michelle did an excellent job of covering two very personal and touchy subjects: Race and Religion!What a wonderful, loving, sincere story. I opened the cover page and read straight through in two days! Great book, a must read. I am definately recommending this to my book club, Pages Readers Group. WOW!!!!!"
4,"Boaz Brown, wonderful","This is a great read. The plot is secondary to the characters that carry this story from start to finish. While quietly showing the ugly side of black pride Stimpson offers a read that creates an introspective atmosphere for LaShondra the main character and the reader. Although other characters bring a lot to the table her realness will be what holds readers to the end. Despite somewhat cookie cutter sub characters and a ""too perfect"" Boaz this is a great read. Get to your favorite online or local bookstore and pick this up you'll be glad you did. The pros definitely outweigh the cons in this book which is why I gave it the Silver rating."
2,Disappointed with deck,"I'd been looking forward to getting this deck. While I've enjoyed reading the card intrepretations, I'm very disappointed with the deck. The cards have a kind of slick/sticky coating that makes them extremely difficult to shuffle. Plus the artwork leaves a lot to be desired."
1,Husbands not to happy,I bought this for my husband and he wasn't to impressed. He said the articals were poorly written and he didn't want me to renew and actually asked if I could cancel it for him because he didn't want to read them anymore. So now he's looking for a different magazine.
1,Unreliable company,"I had ordered this for my son in December he has gone to the mailbox every day looking for the magazine. I called to find out where the magazine is and still no magazine. I was given an excuse that the address was corrected but i did not change it. I was told i would be contacted and a magazine would be delivered this month,no contact and still no magazine."
1,Fast Food Hunting & Fishing,Outdoor Life was once a classy outdoor magazine with good writing and a conservation bent. It has descended to the lowest rung of the genre. Small snippets of trite advice and a heavy heaping of red-neck philosophy. Sad.
2,wow did Outdoor life shrink,"I grew up with Outdoor Life and Jack O'Connor, etc. I didn't realize how it has shrunk over the years. It's quite thin. Fewer pages."
3,Great Collection of WWF Action,"WWF Confirmed Hits! is a great videocassette for any fan who likes a variety of WWF wrestling action. The video contains a WWF Title Match between Champion-Bret Hart and Challenger-British Bulldog. Also a Grudge Match between Razor Ramon and Goldust. Another WWF Title Match between Champion-Diesel and Challenger-Yokozuna. The Undertaker takes on Isaac Yankem D.D.S. (the same man who fans will know today as the Undertaker's younger brother Kane.) Finally a six-man tag team match with Bret Hart, Savio Vega, and Razor Ramon taking on Yokozuna, the late great Owen Hart, and Hakushi. This tape will be an excellent addition to any wrestling fan's collection."
2,1970's TV-type movies,"The picture and sound qualities are fine. You can read Amazon's hyped descriptions of the movies. I did not enjoy the plots of either of them, and returned them."
2,A space of time I will never get back,"After seeing previews for this movie i had high hopes. I thought it would be really funny. It was not. Apart from things that just didn't make sense (the ""aliens"" listen to music from the 1950's) it just wasn't funny. There was also a few dirty scenes that just should not have been in a kids movie. All in all a major let down. Buy ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" instead."
2,Sticky Non-stick,"This non-stick muffin pan is very sticky - even when sprayed with vegetable oil. Slicone is more difficult to scrub than metal. My next muffin pan will be good, old fashioned metal."
3,Returned because of size/shape,"I expected a large muffin pan, not a popover pan. I ordered these thinking they would be texas muffin size, but they are not. They are very deep and tapered quite a bit. The quality seemed fine, but I returned them so I can't say much more about how they hold uup in the oven."
3,Works but not very powerful,"I bought this product at a retail store, and on the first use I realized that after charging it, the light is not as bright as some of the larger units out there, I believe this is a 15 watt unit. Most small bugs will flock to it, and it works on killing them, although you hear no ZAPPING, it's rather quiet. When the grid gets full of bugs or when it needs cleaning, you have to blow it clean with your vacumn cleaner exhaust (at least that's what the instructions recommended), I used the leaf blower and blew the grid of this zapper clean. It is convienent however that it's portable, the downside is, if you don't have an A/C outlet outside, you have to charge it for about 12 hours inside before you can use it for outdoor activity."
1,DVD problems,This DVD will not work in any of our DVD players. We have tried it in several and it always comes up with an error.
2,so dear to my heart,unfortunatley this dvd was unable to be played on any dvd player we own. It would of been nice if i had known that in advance! A waste of money.
3,OK,"The little lamb is adorable and cute, but that is about it. Burl Ives's character mainly just crawls around, singing songs, and the kid is OK. The lamb made me like the movie. It is so cute. But the story is a little lame, so that takes away some of the lamb's cuteness."
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7--No Tech support,"My Tritton UV100 has been working fine with Windows XP, but I was surprised to learn that1. it does not work with Windows 72. there is no tech support for this issue3. there is no information on whether or when this will be addressedThis is unforgivable since beta versions of W7 have been available for a long time and it should not be difficult to create new drivers"
4,Gets the job done,"Only complaint is I wish it supported a higher resolution and wide screen.....someday. Otherwise, the only product I could find to do what I wanted to do (except for its updated version but I read a lot of bad reviews on it so I stayed with what worked).I have a Dell XPS M1330 with one VGA port and a Dell Lattitude D630 in a docking station that has both a VGA and DVI port. In addition to each laptop I have a Dell 24"" wide screen LCD and a 19"" wide screen LCD. My goal was to be able to run each laptop with the dual LCD via KVM switch. That way I could have one laptop running Vista and XP at all times and could just switch between as needed. Since Dell did not make a similar docking station for the M1330 and I could not find one buying two of these devices allowed me to run both laptops with dual LCD support via the KVM switch. The only wish I have is that it supported higher resolution."
1,Krugers Gold is Allinson's Lead,"Historical fiction is fun because it is not a boring recitation of facts. It requires a factual base, interesting characters and sufficient color to keep us interested. Kruger's Gold fails on many levels. The first is the author's decision to throw local dialogue into every conversation as a means to bring us into the time and place of his story. Well, unless I spoke Boer or had a Boer dictionary with me, I couldn't understand any whole sentence on the first 5 pages! Secondly, the author feels the need to demonstrate his knowlege of period weapons and practices with long winded factual details. Really, who cares!I also did not find any of his characters compelling or interesting. At the end of the day, I tried my best to finish Kruger's Gold, but ended up using it for kindling on a cold winter night."
4,"Closest to ""seeing"" Lincoln until Spielberg","The makeup was excellent and the acting first rate. The story was idealized and somewhat over reverential, but that's to be expected. The film was a failure for RKO and nearly drove them out of business in 1941. But, since then, it's earned its place as one of the best Lincoln films. Definitely worth the price. Wholeheartedly recommended."
3,A Bio It's Not,"Be forewarned, for those interested in a full fledged biography of the true inventor of late night TV, who provided the 'template' of late night variety/talk TV , Steve Allen, this is not the book for you. After a brief, cursory review of his early life the book dissolves into a review of Allen's TV career, especially on NBC. Using lots of secondary sources, e.g.newspaper and magazine accounts, with some oral history mixed in, the book has a choppy format, occasionally going back and forth in time. The stories are fun to read but one doesn't really get to know what made Steve Allen tick. Although not particularly well written, it's a good book to at least get an idea of how significant Allen was in TV history."
4,Nikon Celebration,"A very comprehensive look at the history of Nikon. This is a ""must have"" for the Nikon Collector. Everything from the Rangefinders to the ""F"" mount SLR's. Included are serial number charts with manufacturing dates for bodies and lenses."
3,It's okay,"I have never done yoga before and I wanted to try it so I read some reviews on this particular DVD and decided to go for it. It was okay. I felt that she kind of babbled too much and the poses were held for quite a while. I didn't exactly find it as relaxing as it probably should have been.I have only done the video once. I believe in giving things a second chance so I will do that with this video, but I'm not convinced that my star-rating or feelings will change."
5,What's the fuss about? The thing works great.,"I've never spent a fortune for one of these right angle viewers; I just don't use it that much. If I did, I'd get a ""Gigtube Remote Viewfinder""Adorama Aputure Gigtube, Digital Screen Remote Viewfinder for Canon Rebel & Rebel XS/XSi/XT/XTi/Cameras, or aSeculine S2B Zigview Digital View Finderand be done with it. But this little Seagull is clear, solid, swivels, easy to attach (to my Canon 40D), and I can focus with it even with my (vintage) eyes... Which, coupled with my (classic) body, makes getting down for those low-angle shots a real challenge. Great deal; can't imagine what paying more would get me."
5,great paint cups!,I LOVE these! They really do work and have more threads than you expect in the lid so little ones wont unscrew the lids unexpectedly. The funnel tops are great to get the paint covered brushes in without making a mess. The snap on tops are great too to keep paint from drying out. They also fit perfectly in the tabletop easel tray. I would highly recommend.
5,True to Its Name,Received these yesterday and I opened them to allow my 2 year old daughter to paint. These are Perfect! She was able to use the Melissa and Doug Paint brushes that matched the color coding for these paint cups. Great Item!
3,Doesn't fit in other easel's trays,"I decided on another easel for Christmas and ordered these as well. They do not fit in this easel's tray, and it's very aggravating!!!"
3,What Animals Can Teach Us About Spirituality,"My expectation was that this book would take me somewhere I had not been and raise my awareness of the way in which animals increase our spiritual connection. What I got was that we should strive to be ""Loyal as a dog"", etc. I am having trouble finishing it."
1,Boring,Poor graphics. Too dated. It might be OK for someone running DOS but in today's GUI environment it is old.
2,A big disappointment,"I got this book after seeing the ""Dateline"" special on this case. It sounded like an intriguing story - a lonely, insecure 14-year old is beaten to death by a group of schoolmates - and I am always on the lookout for good new true crime. Unfortunately, interesting as the story is, the author is incapable of doing it justice. Her prose is flowery and overblown, more fitting for a bodice ripper than a true crime case, and the narrative is redundant and disjointed. The only reason I'm not giving the book 1 star is that the underlying story really *is* interesting. It's a shame the author couldn't do it justice."
2,Recycled teenage drama with some new metaphors,Godfrey really just needs to learn how to write - each sentence sounds like an opening statement to a grand jury. The Torn Skirt was a superior work compared to this; I'm hoping this book is just a transitory stage.
2,I really wanted to like this book,"The White Boy Shuffle certainly had a very intriguing premise. The first few chapters were great. After that, the trouble began. In the first few chapters, there were small elements of fantasy that caught the reader off-guard. However, after that, Beatty went totally overboard with the fantasy element of the story. It turned from a charming story about a young black man's struggles while growing up into a combination Tom Robbins novel-sermon about what is wrong with society. The last few chapters were almost unreadable. Beatty seems to have lost his focus while writing this book, and it shows."
2,Too abstract for my tastes,"Taken literally, this book is very bizarre. Interpretting the symbolism required a little more brain power than I wanted to put in with free-time reading. However, we used this in our book club; almost everyone else liked it, and there was a lot of discussion."
2,"...Okay, I'll come clean.",You guessed it. I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book. I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do. Sorry.
4,A Wonderful Debut!,"""F.R.I.E.N.D.S. & The Choices That We Make is a moving story about seven women that experience various challenges in their lives; from infidelity, an abusive relationship, family drama, illnesses, death, and many other adversities. Some how these women manage to survive and end up in a state of contentment with their lives.""""This is truly a wonderful debut for Valerie A. Withers. She ingeniously created a story utilizing the letters in the word ""friends"" to name the characters involved.""""Valerie reveals the intricate details of the lives of each friend. Depicted in a conversational dialogue at times. Making the reader feel connected to the characters. This book is funny and sometimes sad, giving readers a dose of reality.""""Through out this interesting story the reader is reminded of the true blessing of having good friends and how important it is to maintain those relationships."""
4,thorough and polished,"I have been doing this as the tape,off and on for many years. I used to be thoroughly worked/wiped out (even with taking ballet several times a week and running 3-4 miles a day). Now, 12 years later, it doesn't seem as difficult. It has the most important elements of yoga. Really do agree that, especially when returning to the practice after a break, to take heed of modifications. It would be ideal to do this tape in front of a mirror so that there isn't unusual posturing. This yoga is not the most intense but will wake up most cells in your body and bring the state of clarity and awareness that yoga has been known for.K.S. is a little competitive/negative and he mostly ignores/defuses it. You can ignore it too."
5,Complete,"This is the book of the greatest, most complex Lego pieces to date, and I highly recommend it to anyone thoroughly engrossed in the area of Lego programming. It is an invaluable resource with amazing graphics, and very creative new inventions which serve as a wonderful catalyst for my own ideas. Great guide."
5,Sensational!,"This marvelous record is a huge, welcome improvement over the self-indulgent ""My People"" and the erratic ""World Tour."" Zawinul returns to his strengths, sound and rhythm. No one is more creative at building layers of contrasting yet complimentary tones from his battery of synths. No one makes electronic sound more natural and organic. Zawinul also minimizes his dependence on that damn Vocorder and lets the sublime Sabine Kabongo handle most of the vocals. This man is 72 years old! May he never stop. Not every record succeeds, but this one is a giant."
3,Fuzzy But Good,"Considering how old some of these clips are they are in pretty good condition. Parts are HILARIOUS! You can tell that this isn't one of the best videos out there, but you get what you pay for."
2,Non-critical survey of dispersion models.,"Zib writes what could easily have been a class notebook (about 100 pages) compilation of mathematical models used for urban atmospheric diffussion analysis. Each page details the mathematics of each model with little attention to critique or explaination.I give the book a thumbs up for detailing the full spectrum of models employed for the urban environment. In this respects, the reader has the opertunity to consider and compare different models. Unfortunately, there was no real practical knowledge departed on these models, nor a critical analysis of their use."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is an excellent resource for American Brilliant Cut Glass collectors. This is the second-edition of Revi's book, and is better and full of more pictures. The pictures of the cut glass are of great quality, and could not look better. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOURCEFUL BOOK. 5 Stars."
5,AWESOME workout,"I like Kathy Smith, but I have to admit that her workouts are sometimes very cheesy. This DVD does have some parts that make me cringe, but now I just laugh at it. It is tricky for beginners. It's dance aerobics. I love it because its intense cardio with dance moves...not just the same boring step aerobics. Any of the moves you can modify to an easier or harder version. It is best if you have room, but my living room is tiny and I find plenty of space to do the workouts. By the time I finish both 20 minute segments (also following the option for a cardio burst in the second 20 minutes) I feel exhausted, but very happy and rejuvenated. This is my favorite cardio DVD. I wish there were more dance ""like"" aerobics out there."
1,Requires years of dance training!,"Aerobics routines like this one are the reason I walked out of a Jazzercise class 15 years ago and never darkened the door of a gym again. The steps are complicated, the cueing is poor, and the instructor does not give the exerciser enough time to learn existing combinations before moving on to something new. I have a small library of 16 workout DVDs. This video hasn't left the shelf since I first tried it. Recently I have rediscovered the joys of working out and lost 25 pounds, but this tape brought the old, awful memories back to me. If you want a great work out withoout tripping over your own feet, then try Tamilee Webb or Crunch Cardio Sculpt."
3,Spastic Cardio is more like it...,"I do like Kathy Smith (see my other reviews), so it pains me to give her a review less than 5 stars. Problem is, in keeping with the ""time saving"" theme, this workout is just completley rushed. She has about 15 people (not an exaggeration) exercising with her. It is as if she held an open casting call for exercisers and then did not want to turn ANYONE down. Of the 15, there are not even 2 people doing the same routine. Kathy is off beat 1/2 the time, there is some crazy Yoko Ono looking women who is just all over the place...actually, she's one of the positive things about this workout since she is at least amusing.All in all, this is still a decent cardio workout. You will work up a sweat and it's only a 20 time commitment. Considering there aren't a ton of good cardio dvds out there, it's not a bad one to have in your collection. I just wouldn't reccommend this to people who are new to cardio workouts."
4,Fast And Furious,"Unlike other reviewers I wasn't a bit annoyed withthe talking in the video. I have other tapes which are MUCH more annoying. Anyway, the first time you try it out it might take a little work, but after a few gos, it will be fun and easy. The second workout is simpler than the first, mainly because it breaks down ito four seperate routines. I liked how the second workout allows you take it up a notch if you so desire. It's low impact and easy on the knees. Overall fun and quick if you have the initative to spare twenty minutes."
1,Disappointing,"I own almost every Kathy Smith video from 1990 on. I have found all of her videos excellent in content and easy to follow. This video is not consistent with all of the others. I was very disappointed with this video. I found the sequences on this video VERY difficult to follow to the point where I got frustrated. I won't even watch it anymore. Now I am a little leary about purchasing her videos because I am concerned that the content may be too difficult to follow. (I read this about some of the reviews on the new Fat Burning Breakthrough video). I am not the most coordinated person but she always was very instructive in her past videos, this one reminds me of a Reebok or Corey Everson video.As a Kathy Smith video fan (and supporter) I hope she doesn't continue to follow this pattern because I won't buy anymore of her videos unless I can view them first."
2,Too much rush for a workout,"I have another Kathy Smith DVD so I am familiar with her steps but this workout was just way too rushed. It was not a smooth, rhythmic workout at all. The combination moves are not introduced well - by the time they were on the 4th move of a combination, I was still trying to get the 1st and 2nd one down. I agree with the other reviews that this DVD is not a good idea if you are working out on a carpeted surface. I would rather slow it down a bit even if it means working out for 10 more minutes so that I could actually participate fully in the routine."
3,Hard Dance Steps,I am a big Kathy Smith fan but I was disappointed by this video. The dance steps are hard for someone like me who doesn't have any dance experience. Try her Kickboxing workout for high intensity.
3,"Good aerobic workout, but very annoying & distracting group","I am a true Kathy Smith fan, and workout with any one of her other videos at least 3 times a week. This video offered a workout that is not as tough as some of her other ones (like her step videos). It is very high quality, with good audio, unlike some of her earlier videos. The one BIG problem with this one is everyone has microphones hooked up and they feel they all need to shout out. It's actually quite irritating and very distracting. If you could get past that, and if you're looking for an easy to intermediate workout, than this is for you."
2,Mostly fiction,"I am a survivor from one of the stories in this book. I wouldn't have enough time or patience to explain why I am saying this, but just be aware that, at least for my story, much of what you read is fictionalized history. The main facts (names, dates, places) are true, but the rest is, shall we say ""generously edited"" to fit the writer's vision. And for her, mission accomplished. For myself and the others from this story, all we got was pain, grief, and disrespect from someone claiming to report ""only the facts."""
2,Neurotic,"Declared inspired by nihilism, this recording is in unknown language(s?) and unorganized modalitities/pitches. A true downer, could not finish tracks much less recognize the tuning if any. Could be useful to break apartment lease when played loudly--.999 of listeners would likely not appreciate its sounds, especially discordant percussion run amok. Set player to ""repeat,"" make sure you are not going to blow out speakers, leave for a few hours, landlord will be in touch. (And I LIKE Philip Glass!)"
5,"Tubin-Prelude solennel, Violin Concerto No.1, Suite on Estonian Dances Lubotsky, Neeme Jarvi-Gothenburd SO","Until recently, the music of Eduard Tubin has been a secret outside of Estonia, his country of origin and Sweden, to which he fled in 1944. Fortunately his work has been championned by the esteemed Estonianconductor Neeme Jarvi on the BIS label. Whereas, this recording does not contain any of the symphonies,it should not be overlooked. Although the charming Concerto for Violin is the major piece on this recording,it is the stirring Prelude solennel which will leave you humming. It might even cause you to buy some of hisother works"
5,Great overall digital camera,"I purchaced this because I was looking for a great entry level digital camera with lots of features for an affordable price. This is what the camera does & has:>Takes still photos up to 1.3 megapixels>Records .avi movie clips (no sound)>MMC/SD card expandable so it sstores virtually unlimited photographs>USB connectable (cord included in package)>TV out>LCD screen for reviewing photo's & movies>Doubles as a webcam>Really small>Runs off of CR123 batteriesTHis is what's bad about the camera:>Eats batteries like no tomorrow>For webcam to work, room needs to be well lit>Flash is insanely bright (excellent unless the picture is taken up close; otherwise, it's great. It could stun a potential mugger if need be).>D-Pad seems flimsy and clickyAll in all, it's worth picking up. With the exception of the batteries, all the bad things about the camera aren't that big of a deal. Recommended highly."
4,Wonder Woman costume,"It was delivered as promised. Excellent quality, all of the accessories a little person wants. Size runs a little small."
5,Lee's Best Era,"This LP along with Captain Fingers, and The Captain's Journey show Lee when he was really 'going for it'. It was incredible to see him do this stuff live with Don Grusin in 1981 backed by Crossfire. Hey, I understand a guy's gotta eat and art for art's sake can't always feed you, but the Smooth Jazz stuff with Grusin/Fourplay/Larry Carlton/GRP is boring elevator music where all that naughty spontaneity/creativity/risk taking has been sanitised out to protect the chicken :-) Just the ticket when you're mowing the lawn maybe and want some 'background music'. If you've only heard Rit after the early 80s do yourself a favour and do some research."
4,Useful even though dated,This book comes with software that you may not be able to use-I can't. My computer doesn't have a floppy disk drive as many don't now days. This is a good student resource for building a career portfolio however it is showing its age (2001) as some of the technologies referenced are no longer used and others that have evolved since aren't memtioned. The basic concepts and excution seem solid no matter what technology a student might use.
2,sounds like good features but lots of problems,I bought this product 2 years back. But frankly speaking I haven't used all of its features. within a few days of buying the battery was losing power for no reason at all and the customer support replaced a new battery. But later the unit started resetting on its own. during this process none of the other buttons are functional and it is a forced reset losing all the information. Now since i am out of warranty i am expected to get it repaired for a fee. we will end up spending more than its original price for the maintenance. i never even had the chance to use all of its features till now because of all the reasons. i don't think its worth spending more on the unit.
1,Lost everything!!!,"I turned on my beautiful, new PocketPC this morning to find... Nothing! That's right, everything was gone. Approximately 150 contacts, lists of all my completed tasks, all of the ones I was working on,or had to complete. Everything, gone. Irrecoverable! Apparently, according to Compaq Tech Support, this unit is basically useless as a stand-alone unit. You must synch it to your comptuer, because if you run out of batteries, you lose everything. I'm glad they told me that now. The main problem is that the unit was full charged when I turned it of on Friday, I did not take it out of my briefcase over the weekend, and the battery was dead when I got back to work after the weekend. How did that happen, you might ask? If anyone figures it out, let me know."
3,iPAQ 5455 Review - cool features but poor battery life,"The iPAQ 5455 seemlessly integrates with MS Outlook on one computer but has issues with syncing up to a second PC. User selection for data overwrite is limited (handheld overwrite PC or PC overwrite handheld data). Overall features are really neat, some stuff included is kinda useless for the average electronics gizmo but the battery life is horrible. If you're planning to go out of town for a couple of days, you'll need a charger (get 2 - one for the rental car and one for the hotel room). Extended life battery is recommended as is an extended service plan if one is offered to you at time of purchase. I had to have mine sent back and 2 other people in my office also had to during their first few weeks of use. The convenience offered by the available features outweighs the annoyances of losing data due to the battery dying."
5,One super computer.,"The HP 5455 is one great computer. I can barely read my own handwriting, yet the 5455 has no difficulty translating it to text in Pocket Word.I easily connected to my PC, browsed the WWW and sent & received E-mail with it.Buy one."
1,Weak attempt at historial romance?,"Sadly disapointed. This novel is a weak attempt to capture an interesting time. The title leads you to believe that the main character is Vlad III, but he is only a minor villan in a tepid romance. She skips crucial events that might make Vlad more sypathetic, while still inserting angsty bits about the death of his family members, just to confuse the reader. The dialogue is stilted and very false, considering the era, and the writer pays too much attention to the historical accuracy of the character's clothing, as if to make up for this. Badly researched overall, it's nearly as painful as the impalements she describes. I would suggest Augustyn's Vlad Dracula: Dragon Prince over this drivel any day."
4,Missing some parts.,One of the boxes was missing the bolts for the smog control. I will send an email to Dorman to see if they can ship them to me. Other than that the manifolds are what I expected.
1,"Caveat Emptor ""let the buyer beware""","Mostly be aware of the numerous 5 star reviews for this book.This book is so lacking that it doesn't even suit the novice.This book is a tout for the authors web site.Usually one can ignore the frequent mention of the authors other collateral such as his experience, websites and seminars but this book is so absent of answers that it's title procliams that you have to believe the book was written soley for promotion and not knowledge.How shallow is this book? Consider this; if the key board that I'm typing on right now where to explode and the keys were to stick to my ceiling, the letters would form better advice about Unlimited Real Estate Profit than this book.Seriously, there are other books that are far better on this subject."
4,Good map for locating tourist points and travelling to them.,"Front side of map is the MVV Schnellbahn-Netzplan, the S-bahn and U-bahn routes. Map is color coded and easy to read. Author has numbered specific sights which are described on the reverse side of the map. Reverse side has 2""x3"" detail maps of the U-bahn station and the nearby point of interest. Includes BMW Museum, Englischer Garten, Oktoberfest, Marienplatz, Viktualienmarkt, Hofbrauhaus, and Neuschwanstein. Well worth the $ 5 retail price."
4,Pom Poko,"Good movie,well made not what I usually collect,was a gift to me from a good friend so am pleased with it and grateful for the gift,can add to your collection as i did and is worth watching again and again."
2,Map is so small it's almost useless,The map is less than 1/2 the size of a traditional paper map. It is durable and easy to fold- but the level of detail and tiny print size make it almost useless except for mapping a route on interstates only.Very disappointed.
1,I ordered this twice and both times disc would not play,I still have not seen this movie and was excited to see it. There must have been a batch of faulty/blank discs. I finally gave up.
5,Excellent!,Brand new in its original shrink wrap as promised. Prompt delivery. Definitely recommend! Could I gush any more? I don't think so!
3,Ho-hum.,"Im a fan of Martial Arts fliks and love Japanese martial arts, so when I saw the reviews for this film I was curious (and you know what they say about being curios)! At a glance, in comparison to ""Iron Monkey"", ""Fearless"", and ""Fist of Legend"" to name a few, this film does'nt even come close to their calibur! It's o.k., dont get me wrong I just dont see how it received 5 stars from most people. If you are familiar with the previously mentioned movies, you'll understand my argument and respect that I am a true fan of Martial Arts and been so from the days of watching them on Saturday afternoons practicing on my brothers, LOL!"
3,"Good movie, Bad Product Details","There's more Korean spoken in this movie than Cantonese (and no Cantonese was ever spoken). Dragon Dynasty detailed that the language in the movie was Cantonese/Mandarin. What a blunder! They must be the dumbest people in the DVD business. I've heard too many bad things about Dragon Dynasty, and this is just another example."
3,Back in the day,"_Something to Sing About_ is a collection of American folk artists' favourite folk songs, with a brief commentary about each artist and the song they chose accompanying each selection. A broad cross-section of folk artists (as of 1970) are represented, from Woody Guthrie (who chose ""Pretty Boy Floyd"") to the Rev. Gary Davis (""Twelve Gates to the City"") to Odetta (""Gallows Pole""), and the songs are arranged quite well. Oh, and some of the pictures are hilarious (eg Tom Paxton)."
2,ehh,"came back from istanbul, turkey where I was drinking apple tea every day. I wanted to continue doing that here but honestly, it's just not the same. Plus there are cheaper ones by lezzo out there."
5,I'm loving this book,I am enthralled with this memoir. It is like having the author there with you telling you her story. She is breaking my heart with the stories regarding her less than loving Father. And I am touched by the loving memories she has of her Mother. This is what a memoir should be. I'm enjoying each word in this wonderful book.
1,If you are looking to get the portable air conditoner pictured in Ad... You will be hot & highly pissed,"This is the only thing that I have ever been misled about in my 5 years of Amazon Shopping. I ordered this after the great Product Description (below) & seeing the pictures. To my great disappointment & frustration what I got was a super sized bottle of some vitamin supplement. DO NOT PURCHASE this item it you are seeking a Portable Air Conditioner!!! I will NEVER trust this vendor, I want my money back & the vendor removed from Amazon for false advertisement!Product FeaturesConserve floor space with the AF-315?s space saving, compact design.Complement even the most modern of decors with the sleek sliver and black frame of the unit.Maintenance is a breeze; the cooling pads never have to be replaced.A built-in timer and remote control are included for convenience and energy efficiency.A variety of filtration methods including an anion generator improve air quality."
2,"could be good, if complete","As with a previous reviewer, our set wasn't complete. It was missing the all important 40 tooth gear cogs. We had a lot of technics pieces from past kits, but none of the 40 toothers unfortunately, so 3 of the 5 'out of the pouch' contraptions couldn't be done. the big gears are hard to get, so it will be another 10 or 20 dollars for me if we want to make these contraptions as per the book.The types of machines was good, the kids were keen to do them."
3,"Henri ,ou est Manuel ? or Henri where is Manuel ?","As a guitarist ,I personally improved my skills by listening to Henri Dikongue who operated a smooth revolution in the way Africa chants .Mota Bobe is good but ""Wa was great "" ,and so was ""C'est la vie"" .It's stands out that this album would been spiced up ,were it for arrangments like Manuel Wandji's. I don't know what happened between henri and his friend Wandji who did such a good job in arranging the 2 previous records . Those guys should manage to get together to lift up the chanting voices of Africa .If Henri does not get what I 'm talking about ,I entrust him to see how Paul simon ,Kumalo ,and Vincent Nguini stick together and succeed .Henri ,Manuel ,RETROUVEZ VOUS POUR LE PROCHAIN ALBUM :SINON ,LE CHAR DES DIEU VOUS TOMBERA SUR LA TETE . An admirer from Washington DC ."
4,VERY NICE FOLLOW-UP,"While not as light as his previous cd C'EST LA VIE in its arrangements, this new effort from Henri Dikongue should be a fine addition to anyone's collection. The rhythms are a little harder than the last, but his singing is as wonderful as ever. There's some great sax contributed by his fellow countryman Manu Dibango -- a nice bonus to an already fine ensemble."
3,Practical Considerations,"The concept is appealing. Treat your edges with this bit and glue them together. More glue surface means a stronger joint.The problem is that one must be exact with the positioning of the bit...and I mean exact. If your're off by a hair, your error is mutlplied twice by the same error on the other board. In addition, the cut of the bit takes off about 1/8"" off each board. It also would have helped if the company published the center point of the bit. I assumed it was 1/2 the overall height.To be fair, this is a well made bit with plenty of heft. Running it around 18000 rpm produced the best performance. If you are interested in this type of edge glueing you might also want to take a look at the company's other offerings, particularly the finger joint edge glue bit. This bit does not need to be exacrly centered but raised or lowered 7/32"" to provide a match."
4,I was there,"I was a pilot on one of the planes the paratroopers in the top of Corregidor so this book describing the assault from the perspective of a paratrooper was extremely interesting to me. I found it factual and it helped me to recall some things that has slipped into the shadowy past. I often wondered what happened to the plane immediately to my right that was hit in the engine as we were over the drop zone. I last saw him descending and trailing black smoke. Flanagan answered my question.I now live in Colorado Springs, CO"
3,MP3 download tracks are mislabeled,"The music is glorious, of course, but the tracks on the MP3 download version are mislabeled, inventing a fourth act, completely inconsistent with the CD version. Someone, either Amazon or SONY Music Entertainment Downloads, needs to clean this up."
5,"This book is well thought out and ""clear"" in explanations.","First let me say this is an excellent book for a graduate class about Wavelets! As a Doctoral Student I have limited funds, but this book I had to purchase, and did. I've used Wickerhauser, Strang & Nguyen, Cohen, and other texts for my references but yours is well thought out and ""clear"". The chapter about Over Complete Wavelets and the Matlab GUI makes this a complete guide to wavelets."
2,Sour Milk Odor,"I haven't used this product long enough to comment on its other characteristics, but I have to mention it has a peculiar unpleasant odor. There's a typical chemical solvent smell, but alongside it is a sour milk smell that makes the product very unpleasant to use. I get the same bad smell from the Weiman Granite Wipes that we bought for our countertops. I'll stick with Sharpie."
3,Not enough for CSA,"Most Foreign Medical Graduates bought this book for the CSA to get ECFMG certificate. This book gave you some advice and information, but not enough to pass CSA. In the book, there is only one specific diagnosis on each case. In real life and CSA, you can not make a clearcut diagnosis based on 15min encounter with the patient. It is dangerous that you force yourself to make a diagnosis in a short period of time."
4,Merck Manuel and coffee enema,The main reason I chose this issue of Merck Manuel (12th edition-1972) was because I had been told info about coffee enemas was in the issues prior to the 13th edition (1977). Sure enough it was! I enjoyed seeing this.
1,terrible,"If you loved the first album, don't buy this, because it doesn't sound a thing like it. It's not heavy, the blues are weak (I hadn't thought it would be possible to blow Midnight Rider but they did), and there are none of psychedelic vocals that Owen did so well on the first album. Terrible. Not one song to recommend. Too bad. Why are Juicy's later albums still available when the excellent first album is no where to be found?"
5,The REAL Britney!!!,"I'm actually from Britney's hometown, and I DO know her. We don't go out and do lunch everytime she's home, but we do chat when we see eachother around town, and I know for a fact that she is and always has been an extremely down-to-earth person. I love this DVD, because it shows the Britney that I know. The tabloids have made her look horrible, but she's really not like that at all. The DVD is amazing, and you really get to know the Britney behind the tabloid.If you want to know what Britney Spears is really like and not just what people decide to write about the poor woman, this DVD is perfect. Not only is it entertaining and hilarious, but it's quite interesting to see that Britney is just a country girl struttin' her stuff on stage. You ROCK, Brit!"
4,Showing Britney in a new light,"I loved this DVD. I was just fascinated by Britney and Kevin. Their tackiness and vulgarity was so funny. Although some of the camera work is hard to watch (jerky, sometimes not completely in focus) it was worth it. This DVD shows how Britney really is. She's human."
5,Great Reality TV!,"This show is so great because it's not scripted, like ""The Simple Life"" or ""The Newlyweds."" I think Mrs.Spears is very fun and the critics just don't like her because she's successful. This DVD will include a bonus CD which I love because it's going to include the songs Chaotic (the theme song) and Someday (I Will Understand) (her new single). I think even if you dislike Britney you should purchase the DVD as I think it will make you love her."
5,Chaotic Is Real Real Thing,"Chaotic is different from other unreal reality show. It's all about britney's real private life. She sing,she laugh,she made joke,she talk about sex,everything is real."
1,Absolute GARBAGE!,This DVD shows exactly what everyone knows these two idiots are: GARBAGE! A pair of NO-TALENT fools at their best. Who in their right mind is going to pay money to see this trash?
1,I cant think of a title,"When I saw this commerical for the dvd, I shook my head in disbelief. While many excellent tv programs have yet to see the light of day, crap like this gets produced by the millions. Simple Life, Punk'd, Viva La Bam, Newlyweds, and now this. How stupid are people that watch this? Im going follow someone around with a camera, not hold it steady, and say some stupid crap. Im a millionare now!"
1,Holy shiznit!!!,"Alright, who's coming up with fake SNs and giving this 5-stars. Probably those Jive fools. :\"
5,awesome!,"this movie was 1 of the funniest movies ive seen in a verry long time. from the start, all the way through i was laughing. i lovet the grandma, she made the movie so much funnier becouse she reminded me of my grandma. i think EVERYONE! should see this movie it will be worth it!"
5,Like Getting to Know a New Friend,"It takes a few pages to catch on to the authors style and sense of humor but is well worth the effort because you will be taken on an unusual journey with the author, his wife and their dog and treated to his unique sense of the world and the people he encounters. The book is overflowing with humor, charm, wit and pathos. I finished it too quickly and now I am eagerly waiting for the next one."
1,Audio CD disappointed me,I borrowed the Audio CD version from my library (book not available) but couldn't take the plummy tone of voice. I do like the topic however and will look for the book.
4,Very Nice deck but...,"I like this deck but I don't like the fact that the Star and the Moon look so much alike, among others. Some of the cards are just too similar. I need to be able to feel a connection with the card to understand it better and I found that to be difficult with this deck. Other than that, they are truely beautiful cards."
3,"Pretty,but:","This golden classic deck is really beautiful,but i think that it's only to collectors..the brightness is so intense,that is difficult to play with this deck.I do not recommend it for begginers."
1,Terrible Tarot Deck!,"As a seasoned scholar and practitioner of tarot meditation and transformation, I was very disappointed with the appearance and quality of this deck. It is poorly manufactured, crudely turned-out and arrived with a cheap, ripped cellophane wrapping. I've purchased several other decks of Tarot card vial Amazon and I have been very pleased in all other instances. What can I say - I guess you get a bad egg every now and again."
5,Very Important Comments of JFK's Assassination,"This book addresses the issues from the Warren Commission to the theories at hand about ""Who"" killed Kennedy."
1,Kindle edition is useless -- color coding doesn't work!,"The heart of this excellent book is a new translation of the Torah/Pentateuch that is color-coded to match the various sources Friedman identifies. Unfortunately, on the Kindle, there is no color! (I am using Kindle for iPhone but I imagine the Kindle device has a similar problem). This makes the bulk of this book absolutely useless on the Kindle. What is worse, the free sample that can be downloaded to your Kindle doesn't reveal this problem -- you only realize after you have paid for the book. Amazon should withdraw the Kindle edition of this book immediately, and I'm going to ask for my money back.I am sorry that this 1-star review will probably drag down the overall rating of this book, which is generally excellent. But the problems with the Kindle have to be highlighted somehow."
4,more than I thought,I expected a short explanantion of the author's thinking but there was a thorough and easily understandable explanation of the way this book was set up. I expected it to be more obscure.
5,Incredible!,"I think this collection contains every piece of clipart ever created. After spending hundreds of dollars on other packages over the years, finally a solution for every project. Thanks, IMSI!"
4,Mystical elements at work,"The StoryLady Alanna, the mistress of Fionnaway, has been missing for four years. Her parents were killed and Alanna was left in the care of Leslie Fairchild. Leslie takes over Fionnaway, destroying the village with his greed. Leslie gets sick and his son, Ian, comes to claim Fionnaway. Ian meets Alanna and she can't decide if she wants to kill him to save Fionnaway. Alanna returns to Fionnaway to preserve the village and her home. There is a supernatural play at work that threatens all the people in Fionnaway. Alanna and Ian must work together against the people that are out to destroy everything.ThoughtsThis book was hard to get into at first. Once the pace started moving faster I was into the story. I didn't know this has supernatural/paranormal elements. That interested me all the more. Mystical elements at work witches and sea creatures. I liked Alanna and Ian, I just didn't care for most of the other characters. I wouldn't read this again, but it was entertaining."
2,Good book to read if you need something to put you to sleep.,"This book was totally ridiculous. While reading it, I found myself skimming through paragraphs just to ease the boredom.The book's summary made the heroine, Alanna, seem like such an independant spitfire when, in fact, she spent the majority of the book obeying Ian and cowering from his father.If Ms. Dodd wants to create a heroine who is truly full of fire I suggest she read some of Brenda Joyce's books, like the ones featuring the Bragg-Shelton family. The heroine in those books were true spitfires and gave as good as they got.This was my first Christina Dodd novel and it'll probably be my last."
3,Written for specialists,"Analyzing Race Talk seems to be a book for grad students doing work in social anthropology, sociology, ethnography, linguistics, philosophy and social psychology. It might also be helpful to those working in co-existence and interethnic studies. But it is technical in that it addresses interviewer behaviors and the discursive habits of thought, ethnic shorthand on the part of research subjects. The Weatherell essay is helpful with regard to analyzing racist discourse here in the U.S. But much of the book is more theoretical, grounded within international contexts."
2,Have we read this book before?,"While the writing, itself, is witty, I can't say the same for the story. This story of a single New York woman with a gay male best friend and a disappointing love life has been written (and filmed) before with less predictability. I kept waiting to be surprised and never was. You can finish the book in your head 200 pages before Witchel finishes it on paper.Because Witchel has a witty, and often wicked, turn-of-phrase, I'd like to read something else she writes--something with a more original plotline and and more original characters."
1,not a funny book,"This book which is sold as humor quickly turns into a disease book (AIDS). I was very depressed at the end and wished I had never picked it up. She needs a good copy editor to help her fix countless sentences that didn't quite make sense. She almost had something to say. I regretted buying it, but more so, reading it."
1,STINKS ON ICE,"This book is the weakest incarnation yet of the currently popular ""hip girl, lives in NYC, works in publishing, seeks husband"" genre. The heroine's self-loathing is only topped by the hatred she feels toward all other women, or at least those she considers competition. And the worst is, it's not even CLEVER... I was rooting for the cheating ex-boyfriend by page 50, I'd drop this loser for the nearest cocktail waitress too...."
1,"bland, boring, generic",Reads like a cross between Helen Fielding and Cynthia Heimel except with none of the humor. Skip.
5,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK!,"I was surprised to read so many bad reviews of this novel!! I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed out loud many times, and actually felt kind of sad when the book came to an end. It reminded me just a bit of that book I read about a million years ago- ""Sheila Levine is Dead and Living in New York."" (Anyone remember that one?) I will certainly look for Alex Witchel's next novel."
3,Manhattan Then,"I found this an absorbing if uneven read. I like fairytales, but found myself skipping over many of them to get back to the book. The pacing and scene breaks are a little bizarre. I would have liked a better revenge against cheating fiance, Bucky. Locking him out of his hotel room - naked - was a good start. Witchel's story is clearly based on real events. Her take on the publishing world rings true and her account of her best friend Paul's death from AIDS is harrowing, if predictable. Since Paul is the only authentic-feeling character in the book, his death is all the more devastating. There's a lovely line Witchel writes: ""porn for the mourning."" This book is for anyone who lived in or spent a lot of time in New York in the 80s. When AIDS changed everything. This took me all the way back there, especially the local hangouts: John's Pizza on Christopher Street and Dave's Potbelly Stove."
4,Good Quality,"It's a little expensive compare to other bamboo cutting boards in local supermarket, but good quality and perfect weight (not too heavy)."
2,Few benefits for home/shop wood worker,"I receieved one of these biscuit shaped glue bottles 9 years ago, with my biscuit joiner, and used it religiously -- at first. Over the years, and several thousand biscuits later, I find laying down a thin stream of glue followed by brushing the glue to a uniform thickness on the board and biscuit surface produces a much stronger joint. Investing the 19.95+ in bulk throw-a-way applicator brushes is a better use of the money."
3,missing something,"It really is missing something. Not that I didn't LIKE the book, it just didn't touch me as some of her other books had. I admit, I did re-read it, just to make sure I wasn't missing something. But it was definately the book. I just didn't like it as much."
4,Nice durable dive flag,"I was surprised at how thick and tough the material is on the float, unlike the typical beach and pool inflatables, it will definitely last. This float was inflated and left to see if it lost any air for two weeks (my wife cut this test short, the flag was in the corner of my dining room) and it did not! That's impressive. I only have two improvements I'd like to see: first, the flag itself is heavy, same material as the float, and would probably keep itself extended and be more visible if it was lighter nylon. And second, the pole for the flag is a little short, so your flag is not visible over a few waves or swells. These issues are both correctable by the user easily, so I gave it 4 stars for it's durability and ease of use. 101snorkel had a great price and delivered quickly too."
5,Heavy duty little float flag!,"I confess that I haven't actually tried this in the water yet, but I've used similar ones in the past and I can tell by looking at it out of the box that this one is going to be great. First of all, the vinyl is very thick, more like what you would see on an inflatable boat than a pool toy, so it will likely last and if it gets dragged across a reef a little bit it won't instantly puncture or tear, not to mention it will stand up to tropical sun exposure. Inflation valves (one in base for water + normal air) look to be durable high quality. Flag is not huge but good enough size. I plan to use this one in conjunction with a regular pole flag that is boat mounted. But if you're beach diving or snorkeling, this one is portable enough to easily bring along in a backpack or dive bag.One thing you should know is that it doesn't come with a tie-off line or clip, but I suppose that keeps the price down and I like to improvise my own anyway."
2,Ms Johnston,Was a little disappointed product wasn't white as it advertise on the box nor does it state that the product color may come in a different color. The storage box was taupe lightly grey color . If I knew this I wouldn't have ordered it . Most of it is assembled however the top part could not align to snap in easy & is still sitting with the top cover off until I can get someone to figure out how to make it snap into place or muscle it together .
5,Great little storage box,"Got this for my husband to keep his charcoal and other B-B-Q supplies in. Just the right size for the patio, and you have all your items hidden. Keeps your patio neat and tidy. You can even sit on it if you want to. I am thinking about putting a plant on mine and make it look like a little table. My husband said it is well-made and easy to put together. Wish it came in white though."
5,Storage Seat,"I was tired of the shoes and other articles constantly left on our front porch by my kids, this is the perfect storage solution (they also keep the things inside dry). They are well made and very sturdy, I purchased some inexpensive outdoor cushions for them and they double as extra seating. I would definitely recommend these to any one in need of a little extra storage."
1,NO HEADBAND PADDING !,I just purchased the 'no headache visor' to wear to Sony Ericcson Tennis in Miami and had not worn until I wore it for the two days we attended the tennis matches. It is absolutely the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE visor I had ever worn and after only two days of use!!!! There is nothing but the thin layer of material over a piece of metal right at the center of headband which left my upper forehead with indentation and very sore. It is unbelievable that there is no padding whatsoever. Would never purchase this item again!!
1,no headache visor gives you a headache,"I ordered this particular visor as I have had other ""no headache"" visors and wanted a brown one. I have had many of this brand but not of this particular style. The color that I wanted was only available in this style so I ordered it and when it came was very pleased with the look of the visor. I wore it and got such a thumping headache but thought maybe it was just a regular headache. The very next time that I tried to wear it, the same thing happened. This time I changed to a different visor at the turn and was surprised to see that my headache left. Needless to say I will not be able to wear the visor again! I don't know what is so different about it but it definitely caused headaches for me!"
5,loved it,"I read this book in 2 days, I think it is the best book the ghost writer has written so far. It is way better than Broken Wings. It doesn't get boring once, I couldn't put it down. I don't know why so many people hated it. But I noticed most of the people who said they hated it didn't read the whole thing. You can't say a book is horrible if you havnt read it! Your not giving the ghost writer enough credit. He comes up with really good ideas.Dr. Foreman is horrible, I wish the girls could have gotten more revenge on her than they did. The buddies are just as bad as Dr. Foreman.Anyway if you are VC Andrews fan, definatly read this book."
3,"Think of ""Maury"" but set in the desert.","Midnight Flight to me was a ""been there, done that"" experience. The same story of wanna be bad girls sent away to cleanse their so-called evil ways and a doctor who thinks she is God and can help them. All these girls were doing was ""crying for help"". By lashing out violently was not the smart way of doing it. I would have like to had more backround information regarding the ""assistants"" who made the heroines lives at the school a living hell. And the ending I found this was sheer ""Lifetime"" television."
2,Very disappointing and sick...,"The first novel in this series was really good, but however this novel was disappointing and if I can get my money back I will! This book had some pretty sick stuff in it i.e. the girls in diapers, the coffins, etc. VCA books has always had some sick incestous type stuff, but this is beyond that! Also, this book just seems to drag on and on! I mean nothing really happens other than the Doctor and the three ""buddies"" torturing the girls until the end. I felt sorry for ""Posy"" , and also the book was never clear on what happens to Mindy in the end. Another problem I had with the ending of this book and the other miniseries with the exception of the Wildflowers series, is that most of the girls seem to have their pipe dreams come true at the end. I mean come on Robin suddenly becomes a singer, and Phobe suddenly gets to become a model and actress?? Get real! This is truly my last VCA's novel!"
1,Boring!!!,"Well...I thought this book was boring. I read the first two chapters about Robin and Teal in the first book, and skipped Phoebe because the storyline was so repetitive for each girl. Well, this book wasn't repetitive, but I thought it was sick and boring. I don't like reading books about people getting ""tortured"" and the coffin part was really disturbing. So was the fact that they had to use diapers. I like V.C. Andrews, but I think she had, and this ghost writer has, a very sick mind. It's always incest, torture, girls locked up in attics, molestation, and other crap. I admire their talent, but I really thought that Midnight Flight was incredibly sick and boring."
4,Great Soundtrack,"This Soundtrack has a lot of great artists and tracks on it. However, most notable and noteworthy is Carly Simon's remix version of ""Our Affair"" from her recent album, ""The Bedroom Tapes."" It is an upbeat, funky mix. It definitely has hit-single potential.Check it out. I recommend it."
4,help,"What is the name of the song that is playing when they get off the plane in Palm Springs (on the way to the water park)? It is the best song in the movie yet it's not on the soundtrack. It starts with ""though you may not drive a great big cadillac..."""
4,A Demonic Version of Munchkin,"This is a fun game...especially when you learn what the cards mean. However there are a few down sides. 1. There is no other way of saying it besides the fact that the cards artwork looks demonic and is quite sacrilegious at times. There have been several occasions when I wanted to play the game with some friends but chose another one because I was not sure how they would feel about the artwork on the cards. 2. There are a lot of key words to learn and at first it is difficult to know what you have in your hand and all the particulars of how to use it. 3. It requires you to have a counter separate from the actual game (like poker chips). Overall a fun game (especially if you want to ""beat up on"" your girlfriend or friend but it could be packaged in a more attractive way. If you are turned off by the look of the game but like the idea of how it plays try Munchkin."
1,Not what I expected!,Just to warn people who may be buying this item thinking it is a film or TV Drama version of the book BE WARNED. It is only a cheap cartoon version.
1,What happened here?,"I bought this book riding on a high of Delaney talent. I had just read Babel 17, and thought it was one of the finest, most unique pieces of Science Fiction I'd ever read. I loved the dysfunctional language, the Eyes, Ears and Nose (ghosts as the engineering crew of a starship - superb!). In fact there wasn't a thing about that novel that I disliked, then I bought Dharlgren.... What happened? Did Delaney's talent mysteriously disappear? A more self-obsessed, mindless waste of paper I don't think I've ever come across. I thought Stephen Donaldson had a tendency to verbose ramblings, but this book could be used to give a masterclass on page-wasting drivel. Maybe there are those out there who will love this, but I prefer to remember the vibrant Delaney of Babel 17."
2,NOT MUCH TO IT,"I believe this book is considered to be some kind of classic, but why I fail to see the reason. It had a few interesting ideas/parts, but was far too long. The fact is that most of its length was comprised of the same non-actions taking place over and over. All the main character seems to do is write, wander around, and have sex (with men, women, and both at the same time) or talk about sex. Nothing more. Its an epic sci-fi (somewhat) story about not much of anything and I was screaming for it to end before even reaching the halfway mark. Those who don't like it from the start need not continue because it still doesn't get any better or go anywhere. But like I said, there are a couple of interesting themes and parts in the book, but they're not worth actually taking on the chore to read this exercise in tedium. Shortened by about 500 pages this could actually be considered a good book. Unfortunately, every boring thought and repetitive action just had to make its way into the story."
4,Uniquely ambiguous,"Dalany's underground favorite is a strange treat for any reader up to its 900 pages of chewy, ambiguous narrative. ""Dhalgren"" is less a novel than an experiment in technique, much like the cut-up efforts of William Burroughs. Superficially, ""Dhalgren"" tells the story of an amnesiac protagonist who finds an identity of sorts amidst the corrupt and tantalizingly beautiful ruins of a fictional city that has isolated itself from the rest of the United States.Like the prose itself, Delany's city is restless and deliberately undefined, the nature of its cataclysm never divulged. Meanwhile, Delany explores sexuality, race and fame with rare candor. We learn to accept Delany's experimental necropolis as the enigma it is. ""Dhalgren"" is a gem, as personal as it is strange and easily the best work by Delany I've read."
1,Unreadable,Tried reading this book again after slogging through it 20 years ago. Unreadable is the only adjective I can think that fits this book. One of the worst SF books ever written IMHO
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Yes, reading the first chapters of this book was definitely for me a lost day... This book does nothing right. The language is pretentious, the plot is extremely boring, and the whole thing is simply feeling wrong. I cannot understand why W.Gibson is praising this book in the foreword as a forerunner of his novels. He is simply another class of writer."
5,Very nice,These burgundy and gold tassels are nicely made and of a good size. I have placed them to either side of a hanging tapestry to add a bit more elegance to the hanging. It looks wonderful.
2,cheap thermostat,"The old saying,you get what you pay for,Still applies.I got a good deal on this thermostat,I just wish it worked!!!"
2,Overblown and poorly directed.,"John Cameron Mitchell's stage show was infinitely better than this poorly directed version. It's self-aggrandizement to the nth degree. What do all the meaningful looks actually mean when one character sings to another? What is Andrea Martin as the Agent doing in the movie? Her character's actions make no sense. Why should we care about Hedwig? At least with the stage show you have the raw excitiment of live theatre, and you develop a rapport with Hedwig; however, here, it feels as though Mitchell just wanted to toot his own egohorn. It's just plain bad storytelling."
2,"Music good, movie bad","Had I been able to cut out the acted scenes and listen, sans picture, to just the music, I'd have rather enjoyed this strange little picture. Alas, since I am not locked in eternal angst over my sexuality, nor am I fond of indulgent, homoerotic navel-gazing, I couldn't get into ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"". Obviously, there is a niche audience for this sort of material, and no doubt that niche adored Hedwig. For the rest of us who politely sat through this flick on behalf of wives/girlfriends... Well, what can I say?"
5,Hedwig rocks..,"I've loved this movie for a long time. I tried buying it, but it was not available here. I have a friend who owns a rental place and he gave me the screener. I finally decided to spend the money to get the DVD, and even though I already HAD the movie, the extra features were worth the price of the DVD."
4,Entertaining!,"An employee at work recommended that I watch this, so I brought it home and watched it. I wasn't disappointed. It was different, but it was good. The songs were great! It reminded me of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", but it was better, I thought. The performances were very good, especially that of John Cameron Mitchell, who is also the film's director, as well as the creator of the play on which the film is based. There were a few sexual scenes that I felt were not necessary, but other than that, I thought it was a pretty good film!"
5,Amazing book!,"This book has helped me grow so much food! I've also grown vegetables and medicinal herbs before and growing sprouts is so MUCH EASIER! You don't need growlights, there's very little chance of disease, and within a week you can add nutrient-dense food to all your salads, sandwiches, soups, chilis, smoothies, and even brownies!Remember to get the hemp bag so the sprouts can breathe properly and consider using good-quality hydrogen peroxide during the process to keep bacteria from growing. This is a super cheap and simple way to have extra food for the family."
5,another winner,"hillsongs music has really become a standard of excellence in church worship music. this CD continues in that same vein. i don't think this album raised the bar of excellence, but it definately matched the level of quality from previous hillsong albums."
5,Greatest Stretch Of Songs I've Ever Heard From Hillsong,"I've received many, many hours of enjoyment and inspiration listening to this Hillsong worship CD. In fact, I think it's one of their best, if not THE best, in their long line of CDs.For me, the best songs begin with the fourth number ""Emmanuel,"" continue through ""Savior,"" ""Wonderful God"" and ""God He Reigns/All I Need Is You."" All the songs blend in like long one medley are they're all fantastic. It continues with three more powerful and wonderfully-presented songs: ""Yours Is This Kingdom,"" ""Welcome In This Place"" and ""Let Us Adore.""That stretch of seven songs - about 45 minutes - is as good as it gets among any Hillsong CD I've ever heard.....and I own a dozen of them."
2,Just a collectors item,"This CD is just a biography of Christina but since it's an unofficial one maybe you don't even want to consider buying it. It has 6 tracks for a 45 minutes biography that sometimes becomes kinda boring especially since all the things said on the CD are out of date already (like her upcoming release of her spanish album and things like that). This CD is like a written biography but rather than having to read it, someone does it for you. It has some parts of Christina's interviews although they don't have a good sound quality. The CD comes with a 100 page book that is incredibly short in its contents (the letters are just too big for the size of the book). This book has some nice pictures too although I didn't like most of them. Just to give you a better idea, if you are a great fan of Christina then you may wanna buy this CD. If you are not, well, you probably have heard all the info in this CD on TV shows or in magazines so I would recommend you to buy something else."
3,Sizing hard to figure out,"Okay - I'd read the other reviews about trying to find the right size for the peanut butter jar you use - so I spent some time trying to make sure that I didn't make the same mistake.... well - I STILL didn't get the size right. The product is a great idea - and I'm sure that there is a great market for this, but the manufactorer needs to be much clearer about the sizing and how to end up with the right model for your product. Thus, they only get 3 stars."
2,doesn't mix as thoroughly as expected,"Compared to using a knife, carefully, this gadget takes more time to set up (and clean), and is much less effective at mixing the oil throughout the container. Sadly, can't recommend it, as it's a brilliant idea."
4,Works as Promised,"Easy to use, just be careful you don't by jars with odd sized tops. Does what is says it will & definitely works easier & neater than trying to mix a jar with a fork or knife...if your peanut butter comes separated from the store you should own this thing"
4,Peanut Butter Mixer,"The product works well, but it is the wrong size for the type of peanut butter jars we normally purchase. The size of the peanut buter mixer was not specified in the ordering information."
1,Better order directly from Witmer,The Witmer company website offers 2 models and various combinations of lid width and jar height. I also had to return the Amazon item because I have Trader Joe jars. I have just ordered from Witmer directly.
3,The Plainsman,"This book was pretty good but it should have been the second in the series because at the end of the third book it's 1876 then she goes back in this one to 1865. The series is a good read but If you're going to read it read this one second. It doesn't make sense otherwise. Mostly because at the end of this book it says that Cole has married Wynne and Beau is getting ready to marry Betsy, but when the second book starts Beau and Betsy have already been married for two years."
5,The plainsman,What a great series from Lori Copeland...she is so funny and it is a great read...I highly recommend for others to read this.
5,Power pop is back!,"This whole CD is a blast! Catchy Euro power pop with great hooks and lyrics, and one of those albums you can listen to straight through, over and over. Yes, it's retro, in every glorious sense of the word - just when you think you'll never hear a string section, a harmony chorus or a minor-seventh chord again, along comes a breath of fresh air like this that makes you want put the top down and crank up the car stereo. ""1000 Times"" is one of the best pop songs I've heard in over a decade - it gives me goose bumps - and there isn't a dud on the rest of the disc. Stop reading right now and put this in your shopping cart!"
4,Not exactly what I wanted but close enough,"This pins came right on time and it they looked great, I have not installed them yet but I'm really looking forward to that. But one that thing that caught my eye immediately as i opened the box it came it, was that the pins were not the ones in the picture. I know it may be a minute thing but I really wanted the ones that where being advertised in the picture. Though is a minor thing I still like the way they look but it would be awesome if the company had actually sent the ones that I were in the picture other than that I love them."
4,japanese music,my cd arived quickly. not sure if tiwas hooped form japan> so i was surprised! very good. enjoy it a lot.thanks.
5,Touch of Frost 14,"At almost the conclusion of this series (only one more season remaining) Season 14 just keeps on thrilling viewers with more of Jack Frost's experiences as Detective Inspector Frost and his cohorts at Denton police headquarters as they hunt down local villans, criminal suspects, and returning criminals reigning crime and terror on Denton residents. Stay tuned for the concluding season scheduled at the end of 2009 as Jack Frost finally retires. What then, will we all do?"
4,A Touch of Frost 14,"Gripping stuff. With a touch of mischievous humour, Frost gets to the bottom of his investigations."
4,Good introductory text to linear algebra,"This is a good textbook with many solved and unsolved problems. I like the fact that it have many examples (one of the final chapters is applications of linear algebra to various fields) without sacrificing mathematical rigor (at the degree it is needed in an undergrad textbook). I didn't like the way it presented bases, spans, domains etc, I thought it was a bit stiff, but this is totally subjective."
2,Undersized,"I have many Freud bits and saw blades. I have always been very happy with their products. Recently I added an Incra LS17 super system to my shop. Because of my past experience with Freud products, I purchased the Freud 8 piece set for Incra Jig. Much to my surprise both straight cut bits in the set were undersized, and produced unacceptable box joints using Incra scales. I returned the set and replaced them with CMT which work well."
1,very dissapointing freud and amazon product,As other reviews mentioned the bits are under sized and does not work with incra templates. I first tried the dovetail joints and realized that the way the incra system work would leave big gaps in both the thru and blind dovetail joints. That deceives the purpose of using a dovetail joint for it strength. Thoose gaps create a weak joint. I got another jig for dovetails and decided to use the incra for box joints. I made 2 boxes and both were so tight that it could not fit together. I measured the router bits and realized that they were under sized. I used a cheapo busy bee tornado bit and magically it worked. Very disappointing that the Freud bits are undersized and useless for the ingra jig. Don't throw your time and money away on this set.
1,Kansas There's Know place like home,My husband really wanted this cd and our Granddaughter Lexi Williams in Santan Valley AZ bought it for him for Christmas and had it shipped directly to us and it doesn't play...tried it in 5 differant players...we need a replacement
3,Received ok,"Dust in the wind is my all time favourite song and it was ok on this disc but I tried very hard to find out the version on this DVD before I bought and I lost again the rest of the DVD is pretty good, just not the version of dust in the wind I wanted."
2,I'll stick with my Kansas LPs...,"I have always loved this band... and I still do. But what's with the symphony orchestra? Most of these great songs are bogged-down by gratuitous orchestral arrangements. Other bands have done it well... like the Eagles. Not so with this concert. Part of the unique element of Kansas was sound of isolated classical instruments bursting through the progressive rock arrangements. More isn't always better. Also, a bit over-produced for my taste. However, great camera work with excellent sound."
1,Unfortunately a waste of time and money.,"I was trying to save money, and this boot assembled very well, but it only stayed on the CV Joint end for a few days. I've been an auto and aircraft mechanic and installed the bands around the ends very tightly with perfectly clean surfaces, but the boot is too stiff to flex properly.After spending $24 for the boot, I spent $75 for a new axle (Honda Accord) and installed it, which took the same amount of time as putting on the boot.Nice idea, very poor product."
1,Factory Direct Return Policy,Make sure this is the product you want. The cost to return this was 20% of original price plus shipping.
1,This is junk!,"This is a piece of junk. Radio reception is horrible from inside a building. Whatever you do, DON'T try to play a cassette, it will eat it for lunch. The only reason I chose this unit was to use up some Am Ex points. Am I glad I didn't pay real money for this."
3,ALL FEATURES OF PRODUCT DIDNT WORK,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE FOR OUR ANNIVERSERY WHEN WE GOT IT WE FOUND THAT THE CD PORTION OF THE PRODUCT DIDNT WORK.WHEN I CONTACTED THE SUPPLIER AND INFORMED THEM OF THE PROBLUM I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE ITEM BUT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO RETURN IT AT OUR EXPPENSE EVEN THOUGH I CONTACTED THE CO THE SUPPLIER THE SAME DAY WE GOT IT TO INFORM THEM OF THE PROBLUMI FEAL THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING BRAND NEW AND THAT IF IT DOESNOT WORK AS IT SHOULD AND THAT IF YOU NOTIFY THE SUPPLIER AS SOON AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLUM THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD PAY THE COST OF RETURNING THE PRODUCT AS WELL AS REPLACING IT AFTER ALL MOST NEW THINGS COME WITH A WARINTY AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE FOR THAT.NO I DO NOY REOOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL,NOT BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF BUT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY YOU HAVE GETTING IT REPLACED IF THEIR IS A PROBLUM.MICHAEL SETTLENEWNAN GA 30263"
2,Confusing,"Ok, let me see how I can explain this. A girl has a guardian angel that steers her away from danger and kills anyone that messes with her. Eventually it is revealed that the guardian angel is a demon of some sort that now wants to kill the girl she once protected and any or all of her friends. All righty then! The acting is terrible, probably why you never heard of any of these clowns in it."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to get this movie for the price. However, I was pleased w/ the shipment. I strongly recommend anyone tempted to buy this to either save their money and rent it or try to get it really cheap. The movie just wasn't what I was hoping it would be."
2,Not bad,I thought this was decent. It had some good scares in it. For all the buildup I would have liked an ending that made a little more sense. Decent acting and film quality for a lower budget horror.
2,Good conversation and humanizing of the Dalai Lama,"This book takes the reader on a much valued and useful journey into the few days of the Dalai Lama. When you are done reading you will think of the Dalai Lama as a good friend, and as a self-willed international leader and celebrity who also is humble. You end wishing that the Dalai Lama were your own cherished brother. If you want a closer look at Buddhism and how to DO it check out The Path to Nirodha which discusses the first turning of the wheel of Dharma, purification, along with the sixteen steps of anapanasati. The difference is about doing Buddhism -- and reading about it on a cursory and peripheral basis in Chan's book."
1,Disappointing sychophantic shallow biography,"I have studied Christian concepts around forgiveness for many years and was hoping to get a new perspective. Very little was said about forgiveness and it was mostly fawning over a religious leader. Having been quite religious at one point in my life I can understand adoring a religious leader. However, the title suggests the content would provide a deep discussion about why forgiveness is good and how one benefits from forgiveness. I found nothing of the sort. What I got instead was detailed minutiae about the author's encounters with the Dali Lama. If the title was something like ""My Life With the Dali Lamma"" then I wouldn't have purchased the book or if I had purchased the book I wouldn't have been disappointed."
2,Not The Same Color As The Picture,"These are well made and very large, but the stones I got are almost colorless...just a pale, pale smokey color."
1,Junk at any Cost!!!,"I wish I would have read the other reviews. It would have saved me two trips, one to buy it and one to return it. They claim it is good for small solder joints? It will vaporize fine copper wires. The tip stays hot longer then a few seconds and if you look at the tip wrong it breaks and a new tip costs more than a new cold heat. I have tried it several times on differnt items I really wanted it to work but it just didnt seem like it worked on anything. I returned it and purchaced a butane soldering iron for my portable needs it works great almost everywhere."
1,Less Than Useless,"I bought the hype on this product, after all it was a Coleman and their laterns, stoves etc. are pretty doggone good.This thing, however, has never worked as advertised, not even close. The first tip disintegrated, the second barelyworked. never soldering worth a flip. Disgusted, I put it out at a yard sale, marked at $1, with no takers.Don't waste your money."
1,Worthless!!!,"I think all these reviews just about covers it all, so I will save you the read. I am just so disappointed in this product that I had to make a statement. This tool without a doubt is the biggest POS that I have in my tool box. I have replaced tips, changed out batteries, but since this unit was new it has not worked efficiently for me in any sense of the word!! And I am not saying that it doesn't power up, it is just worthless!! and to think someone got rich off on this product. So don't waste your time, unless your one of those people that need to have gadgets..RegardsPhil"
2,Router Bits,"These products appear to be fine, however, there is no diagram or picture to indicate the type of ""cut or imprintation the bit is making into the wood. Each router bit should display the type of grooves it makes. Believe this would be helpful in deciding which bit it right for your application."
3,I found this book boring,"Being school pupils we found the Walkabout extremely boring. It has a very immoral story line, however introduced us to other religions(e.g the bush boy). Maybe adults would appreciate the book. The author seemed to waffle on a bit and did not use wonderful vocabulary except at times he used huge words. I have read better books.In conclusion I would say that this book should be read by adults and older children."
5,A wonderful story of curage.,This really tells a wonderful story of humanity and what people can endure and still survive and become better for the experiece.
1,"Great Actors, Horrible Film","Well, if there is one positive thing to mention about this movie, it's that there are some great actors here and they do a good job with what they are provided. The problem is that the story is boring and it goes nowhere. I understand that some great movies can be about ugly topics, but to become great in this genre, they need to excel. This movie was just one scene after the next of bad things happening, with no real emotion about it all and no point or thought provoked by it. Very disappointing."
4,An Interesting Take on Modern Paganism,"I'll be honest, I bought this book from a more Persephone-centric thought process, but I ended up reading the whole thing. It's a very nice, symbolism-rich take on paganism, and I gleaned quite a bit from its pages. It has lots of prayers and a beautiful take on the Demeter/Persephone myth. An added bonus is the wealth of pages on making Greek costumes, garlands, crowns, masks, etc. I would save it just for those alone! Definately worth picking up if you can find it."
5,"A ""must"" for serious goddess devotees","Jennifer Reif's blend of scholarship and practical advice makes for a dynamite book. Demeter is an incredibly important goddess, yet books about her that cover both theory and practice are rare. Go deeper into the myths with this incredibly well-researched book. Highly recommended for all pagans and especially for women in the Goddess movement."
4,grunwell is an idiot,"To John Grunwell, why would Damien Rice go ""back to the UK"" when he is from Kildare, Ireland? American ignorance at its best, the idea that Rice is from the UK is both wrong and an insult to the man and in a roundabout way you've insulted three and a half million good Irish people. The album is good, if a tad whiny."
5,DOWNLOADED DAMIEN RICE AND IM RUNNING TO THE STORE,"I downloaded Volcano, then Amie (yes I deleted these files immediately and don't share any folders for you RIAA police), then I read the reviews here and I RAN to the store to BUY this CD.I took it home and sat and listened and listened and listened. I can't get enough. The most brilliant work I've heard in a very long time. Coldplay, Dixie Chicks, Norah Jones, Allison Kraus, Murray Perahia are among some of my recent favorites and this guy just topped that list.Finally a CD who's 18 dollar price tag made me feel I got a bargin."
4,A Break From the Norm,"While this album is certainly different, (it includes a track with gospel-like chants and one with opera) it is a great listen. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't follow popular radio and who is looking for something exceptional and moving."
5,"So, so good.","I'll be brief. This album is almost too good. There are parts, especially during ""Delicate"" and ""Cannonball,"" when I actually have a physical reaction to the tremor of the vocals. Maybe I'm a bit behind on the times, but I have had this album practically on loop for the last three days. I can't get over it. We need more toe curling music like this."
5,Diverse yet consistently beautiful.,"It was not too many years ago when this album did not leave my CD player for at least ten months. Even now, years later, I am strongly considering doing much the same thing for another ten months. Each and every song on this album is wonderful in its own right, and yet possess that same pleasantly haunting underscore which makes me want to close my eyes at one point or another. Damien Rice has created a sound that is just enough unlike anything I have ever heard to make it timeless in my book. O, in its entirety, is one of the best examples of true music that has been created within the last ten years."
4,top quality album,i think this album is brilliant. the best song by far is 'the blowers daughter'. it is just so good and so nice. cannonball and volcano are also great!
2,can he sing??,"I almost didn't buy this CD after listening to the previews on Amazon. I couldn't believe how 'off' this guy was singing, but the rave reviews convinced me otherwise. When I got the CD, I was amazed at the inconsistency in his voice. He hits so many off-notes that it is painful to listen. There are so many great voices out there that this guy doesn't deserve the accolades he is given. Not even close to a good CD."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"This album is amazing....it literally takes my breath away to listen to some of this songs. In a world of cookie-cutter musicians, and endlessly repetitive radio stations, this CD is a breath of fresh air. Everything about this album is masterfully put together...the gorgeous instrumentals, stark vocals--even the order of songs, beginning with slow and bittersweet and progressing to heart-wrenchingly desperate is genius. The highlights of this album for me are by far ""Delicate"", ""The Blower's Daughter"", ""Amie"", ""I Remember"" and ""Eskimo"", however, every song is worth several listens."
4,grows on you,"this cd came very highly recommended by the raving reviews from a respected friend/critic. i was extremely disappointed at first. the cd seemed slow and uninventive in terms of melody. i gave it about four more half-a** listens. nothing happened. I finally sat down with nothing else to do and cranked up the volume. with focused attention, i finally caught the nuances of his songs and THEN (ONLY then) did the cd start to grow on me. now it doesn't leave my cd player. for me, this is not the traditionally catchy love-at-first listen deal. Definitely worth giving it a try though."
1,I must be wrong,"While I'm generally all for heart-on-the-sleeve balladry - there's a distinct difference between emoting and mewling. To my ear - and I know I'm a minority opinion here - the album is overwrought, pretentious, all but unlistenable - and onits way to the local second-hand goods store this afternoon."
2,Still waters also run shallow.,"The hysterical reviews of this album I've seen here make me think that many people deeply believe in the old saying ""still waters run deep"". This lugubrious album is indeed rather still, but that stillness in no way masks a depth of content.There is nothing challenging in any way about this album, so it will undoubtedly be a big hit, especially among septuagenarians and those who enjoy vanilla ice cream, tidy desks, and uninteresting, routine lovemaking in the missionary position.If you enjoy recreational valium usage, this album is for you! Mellow out, put on your fuzzy slippers, and be comforted by the aural complacence herein."
2,O you can't write a song worth a lick!,"This album has to be one of the most overrated and unmelodic albums of 2003 -- The lyrics are halfway decent, but his voice...it sounds like he's singing while he's laying down just waking up in the morning.There's so many other folk singers out there that deserve Rice's recognition -- I just find this album to be very boring and undeserving of anything more than 2 stars."
5,Outstanding music,This album is an excellent compilation of songs that are soulful and haunting. Something strangely soothing about Rice that makes him one of those artists you just have to listen to regularly.
2,"Geat voice, lame material","Im sorry to say I cant recommend this album, since I do like Mr Rice's voice and phrasing very much..Throughout the entire album, I found myself wishing he had even one decent song to sing here...At the end, the entire experience was simply..forgettable...Maybe he should have just covered some Leonard Cohen songs, or something...My advice to anyone except a hard-core Rice fan, or who is easily impressed, is to skip this, and get a Rufus Wainright album instead..sorry..."
5,Amazing and beautifully performed,"WOW! This album is so powerful the music practically jumps out of my CD player. Even more impressive is Rice put it out as an indie album without the containmation of marketing geeks. His lyrical vision and the soulful presence in his voice are captivating. My teenage daughter loves it, too. My great-grandfather was William Henry Rice from Dublin so Damien might be a distant cousin. Regardless, DON'T MISS THIS ALBUM. Christine Rice"
3,"Unexpectedly Christian, and other books are better","Although I am Christian, I did not find the author's use of religious perspective helpful in conveying information about educating gifted children. That aside, it is not among the better books I've read about raising gifted children. I thought the author reflected about gifted children rather than giving parents or educators new ideas or a framework in which to understand and encourage gifted children. My current favorite is ""Teaching Gifted Kids in the Regular Classroom"" by Susan Winebrenner."
2,"Incredibly salty, as in too salty","The vendor did a good job in providing the papad as expected. My negative rating is not reflective of their service, but rather the product itself. Simply too salty, to the point of being inedible. Bummer, as I really enjoy papadum. I'll keep looking here on Amazon, but will avoid the pink rabbit."
3,Really Should Have Read the Reviews,So pretty but so small (see my photo). And the colors aren't as intense as in the photo. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had seen it at the store.
3,Not nearly as brightly coloured,I got this for decorative purposes and what I have received is nowhere nearly as lively coloured as what's shown on the screen. Major disappointment in that respect. So far I had been enjoying shopping online without having to go into the stores. Apparently there's something to be said for picking up stuff you see and touch.
3,pretty,"Very pretty but smaller than I expected. I don't think it was 3 inches. It was a gift, the receiver was happy"
4,Solid home repair kit,This kit includes just about everything you'll need to make small fixes around the house.The tools are decent quality n will get the job done.The carry case is perfect to keep them organized.A great kit at an affordable price!
5,Great Housewarming present,I ordered this for new homeowners and it definitely included everything they needed to get started. Tools appear to be good quality and there was a great variety.
5,Great for the Price - Everything You Need,"I purchased this product for $49.99 and got free shipping with Amazon Prime. It comes in a bag with everything you need for a start-up kit for everyday tasks around the home. There are probably other kits out there with an even wider variety of tools and more substantial tools, but this one would be hard to beat for the price and the free shipping. I definitely would recommend it."
1,"Rotting food gets trapped inside; smells like a toilet, impossible to clean","Bad design; inner gasket traps food, no way to get it out to properly clean, soaking in bleach etc. doesn't help. Develops the smell of sh--, since that is what rotting food becomes, makes kids say food tastes sour. parents horrified. no amount of pulling, scrubbing, tugging, or other work, gets gasket out. Try the thermos 16 oz Staineless King as model with removable gasket."
2,"Doesn't leak, but food is cold and mushy","I bought this for my kid's lunch. I faithfully followed the directions of filling it in the morning with boiling water for 10-15 minutes prior to filling with hot food. Nevertheless, the lunch was room temperature, not just one day but EVERY single time we used it! Lunches were kept in backpacks on hooks in the classroom--in other words, at room temperature all morning.The upside is that we never had issues with it leaking. So if you just want something lukewarm to stay in a leakproof container, this will fill the bill. If you want hot, it's a gamble. The thermal insulation NEVER worked for my family.So disappointed that I wasted money on this piece of junk. I am hopeful there is something else out there so that I don't have to give up on my child getting a hot lunch from home."
2,poorly directed,"The director apparently has no patriotism. He omitted part of the pledge of allegiance when having the star say it. That is unpatriotic and unacceptable. For a great movie based on America, it was ruined by the destruction of he pledge."
2,Whaaaaaaaat???????,"A woman named Jennifer tries to escape her past. She is released from a mental hospital and instead of heading home she hooks up with some hippies in the desert. This film was made to look like a 70's film, it does a poor job though. The entire movie was confusing and foolish. The clothing was not correct, the slang was incorrect, there was very little gore, and lots of talk. It's one of those films that makes you think you're on something crazy while watching it. I didn't like it much at all. I kept hoping it would get over with, and fast. 1.5 stars out of 5."
1,Not good,The way it was shipped to us it was both worped and cracked in a few places.Tried to order a new one but found it extremely tricky.
1,Sad end to a what seemed a good idea...,"This deals sounds to good to be true...I have seen and owned the run-about exercise balls before,so when I saw the name of the product I was very excited too see how cheap it was! However in reality this is NOT the same product...1) the lid doesn't fit after 2-3 hours of use2) the quality of the ball is so substandard, that it loses its form after first couple bumps3) first batch that was shipped came in broken4) if you have chinchillas like I have, they most likely going to chew the connections off since they are not tight to the surface as on the original ballAt the end of the day I highly discourage anybody who is thinking about buying this product. In fact if I could value this product at no stars I would..."
4,Exercise Ball,"The ball came in exellent condition, and the only problem I found with it was it's a little tricky to put the lids back on."
4,Lessons From The Gypsy Camp,"A delightful and entertaining read that lets us see the world through a child's eye. It is filled with humor, compassion and wry understanding and ultimately reveals important lessons for all of us."
4,This book saves lives,"There have been so many Spanish self-help books over the years. They usually end up on the coffee table. Quick Spanish is just the right size to take into the field and easy to look up phrases.I only wish I had it earlier in my career. Living in California, I have to be able to communicate with the people I am helping. I know it sounds corny, but I have even opened it up looked up a phrase and then communicated.."
1,Charger did not work for Iphone or I Pad,"Was excited of the possibility to charge both my I-Phone and I-Pad at the same time. It would not charge either, very disappointed."
5,What can I say...,"...the price was right, plus this will allow me to charge my Kindle and my iPhone at the same time in the car. I haven't used it yet, but considering what I paid even if I only use it every once in a while, it'll pay for itself with the very first charge.Oh, and the best thing is, I ordered this yesterday!!!"
1,Limited Devices,Product does not charge iPad or similar notepads and computers. It does charge iPhone. I was disappointed because I wanted it for travel utilizing my iPad and computer. Get error message not compatible.
2,It works but has static noise.,My car is 3 years old. when I plug my iPhone to the adapter and plug the audio cable to my iPhone to car I can't hear the audio good. there is a static noise on the audio. if I unplug the adapter audio gets better right away. Look likes the adapter has no stabilizer. There is a fuse but there is it. Adapter works to its purpose. It does recharge the iPhone.
5,Versatile carc charger,With limited plugs in car this allows me to charge 2 items at once! Now I can keep several devices ready to go while on the road.
3,Good enough. Love the price.,For how much it costs I would buy again in a second. It works as designed except sometimes you have to take it out and put it back in to get it to charge. No worries though. I would be upset if I paid a lot for it though.
4,"works fine, light duty build quality.","works fine, light duty build quality. Keep in mind that some devices that go in to cigarette lighters don't fit the same. There seems to be two variations. I added extra female receptacles so I always can find a good fit."
1,Broken,"The item reviewed at my home broken, when I contacted the firm to get a replacement they said they woul dsen dme one, two months later I have not received one or any contact"
1,Crap,"Save your money. Despite the 2 ports, it will only charge one item at a time. The unit constanly needs to be pushed in the outlet to work. It was cheap but I still don't think it was worth it."
4,2 Port USB/White,"This product is just as it looks and is great! I originally bought it for my IPOD, but it works for other stuff too! Sometimes however, it doesn't charge my phone. Seems like a electrical thing, but I'd say for the price, DEFINITELY buy this thing!"
1,"Works, kind of.","I have two main gripes about this charger: 1) It's very long, so it tends to get in the way of my gear shift when anything is plugged into it. 2) Sometimes I have to take it out of the cigarette lighter and plug it back in to get it to actually work. Having said that, I guess that's what comes with the territory when you buy something for five bucks and change."
1,Quit Working After 10-Minutes of Use,"Quit working after 10-minutes of usage, just as noted by some of the others that reviewed this item. But hay, for the price that it's being sold for, I really didn't lose anything. The price was worth the 10-minutes that it worked. You get what you pay for!"
2,I Didn't Expect a Whole Lot for the Price.,"The product arrived on time, straight from Hong Kong. It only works every once in a while with Apple products. When I plug in the USB it will charge for a few minutes and then stop. Since it mentioned iPods in the description, this is what I purchased it for. Also, there is a red light that illuminates indicating that it is plugged in. The red light is incredibly bright and somewhat distracting when driving at night. Also, the light doesn't turn off when your car is turned off, so it acts as if it were a light house notifying all car burglars of possible electronics in the car. But like I mentioned in the title, I didn't expect a whole lot for the price."
1,"Blows Fuse, would not recommend.","This charger has repeatedly blown the fuse for the 12V outlet in my car, a 2011 Prius. I also tried it a friend's '01 Honda Cr-V and it did the same thing. I have used other chargers and they work fine without popping the fuse, so I would not recommend this adapter."
1,Not what it is.,This product is not what it clam to be! The one that I order days ago won't charge two phones at the same time. So it is not what it clam to be. Be ware!
1,Horrible,Horrible! Worked for only a week then stopped working and I couldn't get it to work in any other car either! Don't buy invest in a more expensive one that won't break so quickly.
1,Only one of the port worked for me,I bought this so that i could charge my IPhone and also my GPS at the same time. Unfortunately only one of them worked for me. The other USB port does not work at all. Also received the package late maybe due to USPS fault..But Eforcity did not return my email when i followed up with them on the delay.
3,it has two outlets but only one worked,this thing is beautful and smart but only one of them worked so i can only charge one thing at a time.
3,It works...,cheap and it works... not sure if it will last long... but thats what happens when you buy generic... cheap enough to throw away and replace if it fails..
3,OK for the price,"Bought this to charge my phone for a road trip. Good points: + works really well for what it says on the box Bad points: + after 3 days it seemed like my phone was charging much slower than usual. although this could just be my phone, it works well with other charging terminals..."
2,It's Okay,If you want to charge your phone or ipod on the go this is horrible. The whole ride from work to home is about twenty minutes and does nothing but keep it on while it's on the charger.
1,Useless USB Charger,"I really wish I had something to write that is positive about this item. It basically appears that its charging the device, devices register that they are being charged, but it seemed that no matter how long i left it plugged in, the device actually never really did charge. I thought at first it might be the cable, or the device, but i tried different cables and different devices. I was only hoping for something that would even last a short time, to make it through a business trip i had until I got home and could get my real charger again, so i knew with the low cost it wouldn't be high quality. But i at least hoped it would work at all....such a waste of money. I would recommend steering clear."

SO HOPEFULLY NO MORE NEXT TIME!2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Adapter Dual Plug for iPod MP3 Players Charger - Color White
1,Not a good product,"This product works, but it generates interference. At first, I thought something was wrong with the power outlet. I used another brand and the intererence went away. I would not suggest purchasing this product for use with an mp3 player that you will play through your car stereo. If you're using strictly as a charger adaptor, it's probably ok."
5,Works as expected,"Well, I can't say much except that it does what it's supposed to.Most small electronics nowadays come with a usb cord to plug into your computer, and many of them can be charged by the computer. This device will basically act as a car charger for all of them. I use it for my GPS and Blackberry, both of which use a standard USB mini cord, which I have a few spares of. It's nice being able to charge both at once while in my car.It has two red lights to indicate that each USB port is getting power, but they're always either both on or both off, so you really only need one light. It kinda looks like tail lights of a car."
4,Alright,"It's cheap, but I guess it works! I didn't experience any problems that other reviewers had, but all products are different. Overall, it works and I'm okay with that."
4,good but needs work,Device did not work for blackberry 8530 using a standard usb to usb micro cable. After opening the unit and shoring D+ and D- of the usb the blackberry recognized the power supply and started charging.
1,poor quality,It is a very poor quality product from the outlook. And the item I received was NOT working at all. Don't want to bother returning it. Not worth the time.
1,USB Charger did not work,This charger did not work at all when it was delivered. I tried it in both of my ports and with two USB cords and it didn't work. Scam.
5,Double USB car charger,"low price, fast shipping, working excellent, my car has only one cigarette lighter and now I can use it as double, I really recommend this adapter"
1,2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Dapter Dual Plug for Ipod,I wasted my money won't work on my IPhone/Ipod. Not compatible with apple. I didn't return because I will spent another money just for returning and possibly it will not work again. Maybe original apple product will be the best way to go.
1,Car charger,"Ordered two, the one had only one side that worked and within a month, both of them were broken. They weren't made well at all, I don't suggest anyone buy it."
2,12v dual,"Does not work on apple products which is why I purchased but it does work on other products, but I don't own any. The description should mention it."
1,Bad,"Did not work. I bought one that came from china and works real good. Buy one from the electronics pros, from across the seas."
2,Low Quality,"Worked fine for a month or two. After a couple of months, had to jiggle in socket to get it to work. I now have to spin it back and forth and and jiggle it around in the socket for about five minutes to get it to work. Then it works itself loose after a couple minutes of driving. Pretty useless as a charger now."
3,i didnt buy it for the iphone,this product doesnt work with Universal charger devices that use a micro USB plug. Such as new Nokias and motorolas. Requires a slight mod to the hardware.
1,Doesn't work!,Don't waste your money. You would be better off getting a name brand from apple and pay the money for it.
1,This product is not good,"Hi,I didnt like this product because this is not working, i would like to return but I didnt get time to do that. Let me know if it is possible to writted, first I faced problem to find product like this in Amazon :("
1,Very poor,"The only thing good was timing of delivery, product did not work!! Information on how to return item was not easily available. Shows you get what you pay for in consideration to price"
2,Does NOT work on iPad,"2-Port USB Car Charger AdapterFortunately this adapter was cheap, because I wanted it to charge my iPhone and iPad in the car at the same time, using the other separate charger for my laptop, which I KNEW would need more voltage. I have a single usb adapter that works FINE for both the iPhone and iPad in my car. But this adapter doesn't work for the iPAD even if my iPHONE is NOT plugged in at the same time.You have to review the voltage carefully because assuming it will work like any single usb car charger is wrong. And the ""...and more"" description makes it sound like it works on SO MANY items when I'm sure smaller items are all it gives sufficient voltage to."

1,DOES NOT WORK,RECEIVED THIS ITEM WITH HIGH HOPES TO CHARGE MY NEW IPHONE IN THE CAR. WHAT A MISTAKE. ONLY THING THAT HAS JUICE TO IT IS THE LIGHT THAT TELLS YOU IT IS PLUGGED IN. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR SO BEWARE.
2,1 port of 2 defective,"Unit I received from marketplace seller using Amazon Fulfillment seemed to be well constructed and matched the item shown. Returning item for defect replacement. 1 of the 2 USB ports does not function. The right port works fine but the left port is totally dead. The working right port powered my TomTom or my LG Optimus phone just fine. Problem being, of course, that without both ports working it defeats the purpose of buying a 2 port USB charger."
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR IPHONE!!!!,"Bought this for my new iPhone 4 when i searched iPhone car chargers and this came up. Thought it would be great for my phone and my fiance's ipod while we're driving long distances! Well i plugged in the iPhone and it doesn't even work! Luckily it only cost $4 so it wasn't too big of a loss! But still, why do they sell something that doesn't work!?"
4,Doesn't charger two at once,"I like this charger for my iPhone and it works great... As long as I'm only charging one thing at once. It doesn't seem to have enough juice to charge two things at once, especially if they require a lot of power."
1,Broken After a Day and a Half,"I bought this for a road trip to charge my phone and iPod. It worked great for the first day and half then completely broke and not only stopped charging the devices, but also drained my devices faster because we didn't realize it was broken."
2,Only Half Bad,"After I got this in the mail, I tried it and only 1 of the 2 ports worked. There is not a lot to this product so when only half of it works, it doesn't leave a good impression."
4,Good for $2,"I bought it for $2 and got it sooner than expected.. Solves the purpose.. Though cheap, it works for what it is intended...Would recommend."
4,"Functional, but slightly flawed","Works great with one USB plugged in it. my friend plugged her Galaxy S III in after my iPhone was already plugged in, and her phone didn't start charging. I think the wattage may be low, but it still works great for just me. I haven't tried charging two other things at the same time with this.It's also a little bulky. I wouldn't get this again if I was putting it in a really cramped center console."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this so I could charge my Galaxy Tablet in my car. But, it doesn't work with my Galaxy Tablet. This was a very inexpensive gamble, but it didn't work for me. I only paid a couple of bucks for it, so it's hardly worth my time and effort to send it back (it came from China). It may work for cell phones, but it didn't work for what I needed it for."
3,OK,Purchased quite a few (about 75). About 2% will start smoking on first use. Others appear to work just fine.
1,JUNK!!!,"This product is absolute JUNK. It worked for a few times then as soon as I tried charging two phones on it, it just died. No red light-No charge at all...With this POS, you dont even get what you pay for because its cheaper than cheap! DO NOT BUY!"
2,quality issues,Product has build quality issues. Ordered two of these and one of the two ports in one of them was DOA. Did not bother sending back.
3,"Good service, bad product, bad packaging","I received the adapter broken. The vendor was prompt to send a replacement, which was again broken from the same place. vendor promptly offered money back. Which went well.The product was broken, probably because of poor quality packaging."
4,Works great,"My girlfriend and I both have iPhones (4,3GS) so that's why I got the two port car charger. I was a little skeptical, because of the price but plugged it in and worked like a charm, so when we travel there is no conflict for charging our phones. The only real negative is that is kinda bulky."
1,Doesn't charge at all,Does any one else have tehe problem that is takes forever to charge. I will go across town and my iPod or phone is still dead.
1,Not iPhone 4 compatible!!!!,"It may work perfectly fine for other devices, but for my iPhone 4, charging is not supported. Figured it was too good to be true at that price!"
4,Ainur - Magical Tolkien Music,"I think this is a very particular kind on music. Ainur mix many genres of music in a very beautiful form. The very original 18 members formation is composed by classical elements (violin, viola, cello, flutes, clarinet, harp) rock elements (2 keyboard player, guitar, bass and drum) and by 6 voices. This mixture is particulary suitable in my opinion to recreate the Secondary World of J.R.R.Tolkien (a great inspiration for group Ainur). I think also that compositions are really original and music goes on through melodic moments, hard attack and very beautiful ballads. Really really good, one of the best albums I've never listen to..."
2,did not fit 2001 Dakota 4wd,"sorry to say it did not fit my 2001 Dodge Dakota 4wd. about 1/4"" to 1/2"" too small in diameter. replaced the whole shaft at my cost of about $70."
1,Don't Bother,"I loved the first two Nerd books - A bit of light romance mixed with a bit of sex and all's well that ends well. This book crosses the line from a light romance to way too much S&M sex for me. I am only going to finish it because I paid for it. I like my romance and sex a bit less ""wild""."
1,This is not what was promised,"This product is not what is pictured/described. The product shipped is a multi cable for xbox 360, Wii, and ps2/3. This is a great deal if you need it for that, if you dont ignore this one"
5,Loved it,I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!
3,Nice cable but leads to game consoles is short!,"I am not having the video/audio issues other (low) reviewers have experienced, in fact, the cable I received is nicely constructed and works fine.I would caution buyers that the three leads for the game consoles are short - about 7"" long - so you can not space your consoles very far apart. The only way I could make it work was to stand all three consoles vertically and next to each other with several inches in between to ensure ventilation."
2,Slightly disappointed,"I've been looking forward to seeing this for several months. I've enjoyed Silverman's style & edge in the past.Alas, this film was only occasionally funny. There were some terrific one-liners...but it was long & drawn out, and painfully slow at times. I agree with Roger Ebert - watching this movie makes me want to see Sarah Silverman in something else.Watching the movie was like watching a son or daughter perform at the school play - you really wanted her to do well, despite screwing up all the lines.The only real ""edge"" in this one were some toilet and pen*s jokes - otherwise, she was playing it safe. The singing was a bit dull, and the skits came off as something they threw in to make it a ""real movie"" instead of just a stand up routine. But 75% of the movie was standup, and it wasn't really her best stuff.Maybe she's best in smaller doses."
1,"Silverman is vulgar and outrageous, not funny.","Sarah Silverman is not funny. She tries to outdo everybody else in being outrageous and vulgar. Her performance is often outright disgusting, and she never achieves it to be funny. Being vulgar, outrageous will not remedy being humorless."
5,This is the funniest standup I've seen,"It's edgy, brainy and really funny. I'm not a huge fan of her show, but this is different. Some of the extra bits are boring, like the initial setup (5 minutes) before she actually gets on stage, but well worth it."
2,"5 stars??? Nah, more like two",Sarah is certainly cute and she gets a few clever lines in. But overall I felt this performance was mildly amusing rather than laugh-out-loud hilarious. The bits felt more like padding than anything else.
3,Underwhelming,"Individually, the bits in Jesus is Magic might seem very provocative and funny, but taken as a whole, they remain on a very even pitch, never really hitting brilliance, and never really evoking more than a chuckle.After a while, Sarah Silverman's jokes begin to blur together -- or they would, if they weren't punctuated by somewhat mumbly and cute-at-best musical numbers and skits.Sarah Silverman probably has a great concert movie in her, but this isn't it.Mildly recommended at best."
3,Warning!!,"If you have only seen Sarah on late night tv and thought she wa funny and now want to see this ""movie""...be warned. Yes she is very funny but 98% of the jokes on this movie are about race. I was left wondering if Sarah is racist herself, some of the jokes go soo far that you're left wondering ""should i be angry or is this funny?"""
5,Amazing!!,"I dont review often, but I had to review this. Sarah Silverman is hilarious in her stand up. If you like racial jokes and think awkwardness is funny, than you should see this. She's awesome. WATCH IT!"
5,Never change the sweetner PLEASE!!!,These are so freaking delicious. I hope they never switch to Sucralose(which ruined the Fruit Flavor ones for me). The Sorbets were amazing too but they discontinued those.
3,Does the Job!,"You know, it has good latency monitoring. (Not great, but good). It can go up to 48kHz Sampling Rate, and can be set up easily. The downside? It only has 2 inputs... both RCA for Left and Right. You need a mixer that will take care of all the recording before hand and have the main outputs bus to these two inputs. Another downfall is that since it DOES only have two inputs (L/R), if you have a whole band playing together at once, you have to do all the EQing/compression before hand for every instrument which requires more external equipment. I got it for my cousin for Christmas and he's limited to what he can use so it worked out just fine, but for bigger situations, this is (obviously) not your friend."
5,Good value,"It works well, and is automatically detected by MAC-OS and Linux, using Audacity. I am not an expert in audio issues, but it seems to work very well in terms of audio quality. I don't know if this is a problem specific of this item, but sometimes there is an interference noise that dissapears when I move it to a different position, perhaps it needs to be shielded against noise."
3,Not with Vista,If you have Vista you have to download another capture program to make this thing work. It was nice to be able to listen to what you were recording by plugging earphones into it. It does an excellent job transferring from a playing device to the computer via USB
4,For Mac OSX 10.4,"I couldn't get it to work with my iBookG4 with OSX 10.4. I wrote Behringer and got this reply, which fixed it.====================First go to your system preferences > sound > input > select USB Audio CODEC. Output > select USB Audio CODEC.Second, go to applications > utilities > audio midi setup > audio devices > default input > select USB Audio CODEC. Default output: > select USB Audio CODEC. System output: > select USB Audio CODEC. Properties for: > select USB Audio CODEC.In addition, make sure to select 44100.0 Hz and 2ch-16bit for the audio input and audio output.=====================I like the sound quality. I find Finyl Vinyl is a little easier to use than Audacity, but you must go to Finyl Vinyl Preferences and select USB Audio Codec wherever."
5,Works Well,We use the Behringer at our church to interface the audio out of our sound board going to a laptop in order to record our services. The Behringer works well and is a fine product for this cost.
1,Quarter of a star would be a better rating.,The interface didn't work well for me. There was a constant buzz no matter how I tried to hook it up. Spend a little more and get a product that will work well. I'm returning mine!
1,UCA 202 Defects,"This unit did a moderate job until it lost the right channel, after which Behringer no longer knows you. Any requests for answers are a useless endeavor. This company needs a better quality control system, and the ability to communicate with users of their products. I do not recommend them for this reason."
3,Beware!,"When you try to monitor with this device, it's not a good idea. Because I have a home studio, I do not have any soundproof rooms specially for recording. Therefore, I have access between the computer and the mixer. I believed that this audio interface was a great device since I could hear both the audio of the computer as well as the mixer for monitoring. However, when there is ANYTHING connected to the headphone jack of this Behringer interface while recording, your recorder or computer device will receive distorted signals. It took me a while to figure out that the plugged in headphone jacks were causing excessive sound of air and weird metering charts on my computer. Otherwise, everything works fine."
2,Channels don't work individually. Frustrating for DJing,"I got this for effects DJing along with a NUMARK MIXTRACK.You can't use this to listen to your headphones and output audio as two separate channels.It doesn't require drivers but I found that some software (TRAKTOR) will need ASIO4ALL to allow you to use it. Virtual DJ was pretty frustrating also but mainly because of its unrelated instability issues.As far as quality goes, it sounds ok but I haven't had the chance to try it with any high quality monitor or PA system yet.Probably will return it and get a controller with built in audio, like the MIXTRACK PRO."
4,Great Little Product !!!,"I purchased this to digitize audio tapes and record my karaoke for later burning onto CD's. It works great in conjunction with a program called ""Spin it Again"" on my laptop and my desktop computers, running ""XP home and XP Pro"". It's a no brainer to hook up and use. Highly recommend this product."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,"THERE HAS BEEN A DOCUMENTARY SERIES ON PUBLIC TV TITLED ""NAZI HUNTERS"" THAT I FELT WAS WELL DONE AND WAS GOING TO USE THIS DVD FOR ONE OF MY CLASSES BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT OFFERING AND WILL NOT WORK FOR THE PURPOSES I HAD INTENDED."
1,not for all regions,"Before I purchase any Dvd ..I make it a point to always check the regional setting. But this one doesn't seem right as advertised. It won't work with my player. I need an all regions Dvd. Also, be truthful with your print ad."
2,Not Helpful,Not sure what the previous reviewers liked so much about this book but I found it extremely generic and not new information. Everything in this book you can find online on other sources. Not worth the small price I paid for it.
4,"Sellers -- Edwards -- Shag, baby!","I agree with many of the complaints others have had regarding the set. 'Return' should have been included ($$$ always wins over distributors) and though 'Curse' and 'Son' are terrible beyond words, they are part of the Blake Edwards Panther oeuvre and should have been found in the set.Let's not even mention 'Inspector Clouseau'.No Sellers = No Clouseau.Sorry Mr. Arkin.Beyond that, the set is beautiful. The supplemental stuff is sparse but it's a nice package altogether, mostly due to the artwork of SHAG. His work on this edition (and other Panther 40th Anniversary Merchandise) is perfectly in tune with the phenomenon. His art alone is worth the price of the set. I'm happy to see his talent getting some of the widespread attention it deserves."
3,pink panther review,"I guess my tastes have changed. Used to love all the Pink Panther movies. Now, Peter Sellers just doesn't seem as funny to me. But they are still an enjoyable set of movies to watch."
5,Pink Panther Film Collecton,The package arrived in excellent shape and the DVD's are all perfect. If you like the Pink Panther its a great buy.
1,pink panther movies,I may have been able to comment if I had actually received the videos but to date one month later it has not yet happened.
5,Fantastic collection!,"I was never a huge fan of the Pink Panther series growing up. Until I was a teenager, I thought it was only a cartoon. But when I finally saw the Peter Sellers movies, I was in love. Not all of these movies are amazing and he was only in the first few, but the collection is still great fun to watch."
5,The Pink Panther Collection,"This is a great set of the black & white Pink Panther shows.It may seem expensive but you do get a lot of discs with it so if you like the old Pink Panther, this is the one for you."
1,DISAPPOINTED,great deal just for analognew TV's it won't work HDTV or Digital. wasted my money it useless to me
2,please i need information about the content of the cd,there are no information about the musics in the cd
4,"LP three features ""Lonesome Town""","RICKY SINGS AGAIN! was the third LP for Eric Hilliard Nelson. This 1958 IMPERIAL release (LP-9061) peaked at #14 on Billboard's album chart. Three of its tracks were Top Ten songs: ""Lonesome Town"" (#7), ""It's Late"" (#9) and ""Never Be Anyone But You,"" the 'B' of ""It's Late,"" which made it to #6.The back cover of original pressings have a Ricky at 18 bio and ads for his two previous releases,RICKY(#1) andRICKY NELSON(#7).With arrangements by Jimmie Haskell, musicians for these sessions were James Burton (guitar), James Kirkland (bass), Richie Frost (drums) and Gene Garth (piano).PROGRAM--SIDE ONE[1:57] It's Late[1:50] One Of These Mornings[2:04] Believe What You Say[2:15] Lonesome Town[2:14] Trying To Get To You[2:25] Be True To MeSIDE TWO[2:16] Old Enough To Love[2:15] Never Be Anyone Else But You[2:16] I Can't Help It[2:20] You Tear Me Up[1:58] It's All In The Game[1:56] Restless KidTOTAL TIME: 25:46"
1,Did Not Fit 2005 GMC 2500HD Camper Mirrors,"The product looked great when it arrived but did not fit my 2005 GMC even though the E-Bay ""Does It Fit"" utility said it would."
3,Araya,"Tied with HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR @ 1959 Cannes, but still, zzzzz. Director Benacerraf huffs that this is *not* a documentary, but a ""tone poem"". Monotone, that is. Rather than let her (pretty, yes) images poetically flow, she ladles on glop after glop of non-stop condescending narration that does the ""noble savage"" bit all too well. Salt-pork-fisted. +1 for being *very* pretty, tho. 5/10"
1,Readers of this book apologize to Muslims For,"She summarizes complex concepts into such inarticulate and coarse, often mentally ill, comments -- [...]. Her introduction is a must SKIP before the elections.A paraphrase of her recent smear campaign gives a flavor -- Cheney essentially said ""vote for us or be laughed at like liberals""... soon he will take it to the logical conclusion ""vote for us or become womanly [...] like liberals."""
1,"So Ms. Dowd, you really are joking....","Because the whole book is a joke. With all the amount you criticise this country you should just leave. We have a great place to go, its not too far, called Canada and you can bring the rest with you. Obviously you must be too liberal otherwise we wouldn't have a conservative in the White House, or perhaps your books aren't making a difference.In all seriousness everyone, there is a reason why there are so many used books available on this site."
1,Do Not Buy! ( If You Cant Hear Go Ahead),This Is A Horrible Wire When You Plug This In You Ever Get A Bad Sound Or A Bad Picture...Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!
2,Do not purchase if you plug your audio into a receiver,"Whereas most plugs have the audio and video wires far enough apart so you may plug the video into your television and the audio into a receiver (or allow you to peal them apart if need be) the audio and s-video/video plugs on this item are 3 inches apart fully outstretched, as you can see from the picture, making it impossible to do so. If you don't mind your television's speakers, then this product will do just fine. However, those of us who prefer to plug the audio of our gaming systems into home theater systems will be disappointed with it. They just didn't allow enough slack at the end of the cables. Having zero slack also prevents simultaneously hooking up any of the consoles if that is what you were hoping to do.Overall a rather poor and shortsighted design."
2,Bad Connection,"I got this for my xbox360. Cable doesn't always work on first try. You have to wiggle it around to get it to work, then hope it stays working. This is the correct cable as described, but the picture is for the older cable which supported PS1/PS2 + GC/SNES/N64 + Original Xbox. This cable supports PS3 + Wii + Xbox360."
2,Sonny Chiba Fun,Body Guard 2.5/5Cast: Sonny ChibaI am a fan of Sonny Chiba. Not a huge fan but a fan nonetheless. Okay I'm going to be honest I bought this film for a dollar and have seen it at least 10 times. The version I own is from Digiview Productions and is poor quality and is probable cut. This film is authentic Sonny Chiba and it is a good movie don't get me wrong. Well for the price I paid for it I guess it was worth it.
1,Kung Pow! Sonny Chiba Rocks On!,"Sonny Chiba can be called a poor man's Bruce Lee...full of attitude, self-taught, great martial artist, but flops around like a great white shark on the deck of party boat! Sonny truly is the final answer to critics who say you can't make it on guts, emotion, furrowed brows and monkey-do kung fu. I can't get behind this DVD because it doesn't even list what the heck we're talking about. But, if you're at all interested, track down the out of print double-features that bring the top six Chiba films out of retirement."
4,ROB ZOMBIE COPYCAT,"This movie was similar to House of 1,000 Corpses. It is a combination of Texas Chainsaw and Blood Sucking Freaks. The movie has gore and is pornographic without nudity and includes one rape. The bad guys are well played and colorful, about as much as one can expect from a movie named ""Blood Ranch."" If you are a Rob Zombie fan, and enjoy mixing gore with philosophy check this one out."
4,In the Ranch Web,I would have given a better score but for two things.Not recorded in 5.1 and the ending was too abrupt not well done. Now the good stuff if you like horror/suspense you are in for a treat. One of the best movies of this sort to come out in a while.Don't want to give too much away but trust me on this one.Just give it a look don't think there are are lot of copies out there so rent it if you have too.But you're going to like it!
3,ok product,"its an ok bit. i've been using it with my milwaukee 1.75 HP router with PT Fir 2""x6"" and on the bit it has already chipped a little. i was expecting the bit to last longer than that. oh and the bearing fell off while i was routing. i used a hex wrench to place it back on. maybe i got a dud product. others have had better luck than me."
5,Great sound and features where you need 2 speaker surround,"I have had this unit installed on a yacht for 3 years and it works great. Sound is excellent, the sub is small enough to stash away in a cabinet, the DVD has worked fine. The one glitch is that the treble control has a bug where you have to press the ""select"" button and ""up"" arrow on the treble to get a boosted treble to kick in. I tolk Sherwood about this, they may have fixed this in later units."
1,Okay while it worked...,"I bought this about 11 months ago, and everything worked okay for a while. I say okay because the sound was a bit weaker than I expected. Maybe my expectations were too high for a two speaker system. After about 4-6 months of use, the DVD player acted funny. It would freeze up or not detect DVDs. I blamed Netflix and would send movies back to them, thinking they were defective. It was random, so the excuse seemed to make sense. After months of thinking Netflix was retarded, I realized that it was actually my DVD player that was causing the problems. The sporadic problems became more and more common, and about a month ago, the DVD player just stopped working. I am sending it back to Amazon for a partial refund. Total waste of time and money."
3,Just OK,"I enjoy the sound that the system produces. My wife likes the fact that there are not speakers spread all over the living room. However, I have experienced technical difficulties with the subwoofer and the DVD player. With the subwoofer in the automatic setting, it seldom comes out of the sleep mode when the system is turned on; thus we have to fiddle around with the on/off switch each time we turn on the system and at the end of the day (it is not controlled via the remote). Also, after playing 2 DVDs just fine, the player quit working. It plays the DVD for a short while and all of a sudden just freezes up and will not respond to any commands either from the remote or the buttons on the unit itself. I have not contacted customer service since this just happened over the weekend but hope they are responsive."
5,Much Needed Book,This book provides the information needed to develop Web Systems in an organisational setting. It takes you through all the components of development with an innovative approach called ICDM. The methods have helped me greatly at work in my role as a Web developer.
2,"Looks nice, but not square","I double-, triple- and quadruple-checked against other squares and against itself (using the ""draw a line and flip it"" technique). Mine was off by over a 1/16 of an inch over its length. It was packed well and the shipping box was in excellent shape, so I'm sure that shipping damage didn't cause the inaccuracy. Also, it had a serious burr on the end of the blade where it had obviously been stamped out. I'll give it an extra star for the pretty handle, but it's definitely not the quality I expected. I returned it."
4,An eyewitness of the first Hungarian revolution,"Dr Jaszi's book is a personal narrative and defense of the Hungarian revolution of 1918-19 of which he was a main participant. His book is a mix of history as seen from the author's point of view (a democrat's surrounded by right wing antidemocrat conservatives and radical bolshevik revolutionaries) and a apology of the failed democracy he and a few others tried to set up in Hungary among the postwar chaos. Though not particularly easy to read due to the old-fashioned didactic style of the author, it is a relevant book for readers interested in the turmoil that followed the World War and the crimes of the White Terror that ended the revolutionary experiment."
5,Holy Carlorie Burn Batman!,"This is the newest of Sylwia's workouts and the toughest ever. I suggest if you want to start with Tonique get Tonique Premier first. It's a little ""easier"". Ha! This one is over 2 hours of jumping, kicking, mountain climbers, with some mat work mixed in. But the mat work is especially tough because you never actually rest. You use the mat for your hands only. I actually had a hard time finishing this the first time but WOW if you stick with it you will have the endurance of a runner and the body of a dancer. It's really tough to break down into sections but just know you will WORK and probably have to hit pause a few times to catch your breath. But any of the Tonique dvds will whip you into shape FAST. That's why I love it so much."
3,Goblin Moon,"As the result of an accident, the Goblin race teeters on the brink of extinction. First, enviromental poison, then psychological poison worked to depopulate a once proud people. In a last ditch effort to save his people, on orders of the Sorceress, Tearach is forced to marry a human woman, hoping to find a healing for his people on multiple levels. Despite himself, Tearach does come to genuinely like Kathy Parker, the woman chosen as his ideal mate. Yet, there are no true guarantees that this reckless scheme will work, and in fact, more than one factor stands against its success. Will true love conquer all?*** Making a powerful allegorical statement about forgiveness and the power of the soul to influence the body, Ms. Sams re-introduces readers to the idyllic, magical land of the Order. Who says that inspirational messages can't be delivered in a package with a touch of the sensual? Whoever it was, never read Goblin Moon. ***"
4,Beautifully played. Excellent price. Ok recording.,"I have listened through the five discs twice the last two days. The Hungarian Dances with Klien and Brendel are worth the price of the set. The Hungarian Dances with the Klien Duo are also quite well done. Klien is an excellent pianist in the solo Brahms pieces frequently playing with great beauty. Unfortunately the recording lets him down in some of the louder passages of the music which is why I have rated this group of CDs four rather than 5. If you are unfamiliar with the Opus 76, 116, 117, 118 and 119 sets they contain some incredibly beautiful music. Alternatively for a little more money the Katchen set should also be considered."
4,Hard Fit,"This does fit the core system, however it is a squeeze to try to fit all the cables with it, and I cannot see how you can fit all the cables, 4 controllers, headsets, and strategy guides."
4,Good condition,I bought this book used of Amazon and it was in great condition. The story is pretty good but I wouldnt read it unless I was being forced to by my California history class.
1,I am very sorry to have spend my money and my time with it.,"Garbage, the book is poorly organized and full of errors. The way it is written is very poor. It jumps up and down from the very beginning and does not flow as is supposed to do do. Remember this book is about estimating and estimating requires step by step organization and constancy. This book has none of it. I have work with Excel spreadsheets to do estimates for almost eleven years and this book did not add one cent to my knowledge or abilities. I am very sorry to have spend my money and my time with it."
2,So out of Sync !!!,"I have tried three different commercial copies of this dvd and all of them have the California Jam section(which runs about an hour) badly out of sync audio with video.Could have been a great package ""a la"" Zeppelin,but either the band did not get involved or the producers were sleeping at the desk."
2,Its ok,"Well I thought this would help out with energy and what not.. but I'm not saying it doesnt work or that it does. It simply wasnt what i expected. But at times i did feel really good when taking this product, dont know if it was some kind of placebo effect."
2,Humm....,I can't say that this has made a very big impact on my health. I've been taking this for about two weeks and honestly cannot tell a difference.
5,wonderous stuff,"I have NEVER written a review before, but this stuff is so amazing I felt compelled to. It has healed an old shoulder injury and stopped my pain and tenderness that NO DOCTOR has been able to fix..besides giving me pain killers. My husband also feels so much better, he takes it daily faithfully and he is a skeptic. I have recommended it to everyone I know and it has helped every single person who has tried it. To be honest, there is no way I believe the few people who left negative feedback gave it a full chance. It is amazing!!"
3,Wow,"This stuff makes me feel a little strange. I can definitely agree with the other reviews about the immediate effect. However, I have not been taking it long at all and I literally had to lower the dosage in my water because I started to feel, well kind of 'high'. I feel something working. My body feels a bit lighter, not as tense as before... Obviously some people absolutely love this stuff, maybe I will write again when I finish the bottle."
4,Didn't work for me - however it sort of works for my mom,"I think it really depending on who is taking it. After took a couple bottles of this and I did noticed able to focus better during the day time. However, I started to sleep very light and wake up easily. There was more frequent bowel movement but stools becomes harder. I had to stop a few times and as soon as I do so, I can sleep better.As for my mom, she felt more alert during the daytime. She did experience the initial ""detox"" effect but that went away in a couple of weeks. She didn't notice any changes in her sleeping pattern. She has been taking this for almost a year now and still likes it. :)"
3,"SOME of the tip were helpful, while others were useless.","I found the book to be very helpful in some aspects of my game...there were a few shots i had never thought of taking and i even turned a few heads. But the book didnt really help my over all game and most of the shots that were helpful hardly ever come up. I was looking for a book to help me be a better pool player and i was slightly disappointed. cj keronen (slakker@msn.com) howell,nj"
2,No Drivers,Piece of crap network card does not come with a driver disk and Win XP Pro won't recognize it. And of course if you install the card you can't go online to get the drivers because the card won't work without drivers. What a waste of time and money.
1,manufacturing problem?,"The card I received had a very short mounting shank, about 1/2 inch instead of the ~1.5 inch standard. It was not as shown in the picture!!If the tie-down was on the tie-down bracket then the contacts were an inch from the slot."
1,Gross!!!,"I watched this flim and could not believe how gross it was.Phantom of the opera is a beautiful love story about a man who loves a woman, but can never have her. This ruined the whole meaning. This was made in the 80's when people were still loving the nightmare on elm street flims. That guy who plays freddy plays Erik. The speical fetures are horrible. Only a trailer to watch. Watch the newer version of POTO and enjoy, while you throw this slasher flick out the window."
3,Don't Bash this one just yet...,"Downside: Complete murder of the storyUpside:1:We get to see Robert do a role other than Freddy.2:The movie does provide a certain atmosphere that other Phantom movies don't provide. I can't quite place it, but there is an aura about the movie that says ""Phantom"".3: The musical score is fabulous. No lies. No Cheezy synthesizer here.4: It does WAY better as a horror version of Phantom than the crappy one with that Julian guy in it."
3,Interesting,"This movie is not for everyone, and it is a far cry from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom. There are some good romantic scenes between the Phantom and Christine, but they have made Erik quite ""bloodlusty"" in some instances. It *is* a horror movie after all, with some romance mixed in. If you are a die hard Phantom of the Opera fan, there is a good chance that you'll enjoy this movie, especially if you like the darker side of Phantom. END"
3,FREDDY MEETS THE PHANTOM,"Although generally panned by most critics, this 1989 version of the classic Leroux novel is quite effective, featuring a chilling performance by Freddy Kruger himself, Robert Englund. It's nicely shot in Hungary, and has some lovely music and atmosphere. The gory make-up effects are quite chilling too. This time around the Phantom is a music writer who sold his soul to the devil but had to pay a hideous price. Jill Scholen (POPCORN) is lovely as the heroine Christine, and whoever sang for her does a beautiful job. While not a classic treatment of the story, it is an effective and well done one."
5,EXCELLENT,"Sound is awesome, speakers were very heavy for size. I have hooked up to sony 52 inch lcd, makes for great movie watching. Blows everything away at similar price range!"
1,heartsapphires,I love this movie.but it kept freezing and i could only see about 20 minutes....then it went off..i couldnt watch the rest
2,2 Stars,"Good-hearted physical therapist Leslie Wright (Queen Latifah) is looking for romance but keeps finding duds until she meets professional basketball player Scott McKnight (Common). When Scott suffers a major injury, it's up to Leslie to save his career. Leslie and Scott become close as they work together, but Leslie's beautiful, gold-digging childhood chum -- who is also Scott's estranged girlfriend -- threatens their relationship.check out my full review @[...]"
1,"Bad Acting, No Chemistry","This movie was terrible!! No wonder it never made it to the theaters. I got this as a bootleg and just want to give it back! I was really surprised at the bad acting and predictable script because Common and Queen Latifah have done well in a lot of roles in other big budget movies. First of all, Queen's character didn't feel like she was really looking for a man, but everyone around her was looking for her. Then when she met Common's character, it took FOREVER for them to realize they liked each other. Common and Queen Latifah had absolutely NO sexual chemistry at all. Not one time in all the ""quality time"" they shared did they even act attracted to one another! Watching them together was like watching someone eat Wonder bread soaked in tap water, trying to convince you it tastes good. The best part of this movie was Phylicia Rashad's part as the mother, but even that role was a waste of her time. Do better black people."
3,"Starts out great, but...","If you want to feel good at the end of a story, this is not the book for you. It's a fascinating glimpse into the real life of an author, and it's a neat exploration into a time and region that no longer exists. But the end of the book, in it's honesty, makes you feel kind of sad and cynical. Hmm bummer."
3,Read this review,"If you would like to read a confusing and a all right book you should read the Pigman and Me by Paul Zindel. In the book the Pigman is a ""Person who can see everything you can do and he will be there for you when you need him the most."" The Pigman is like your guardian angel. Paul is another character in the story. He is a boy that has no father but has a mother that is a little disabled and moves around to different places a lot. He looks up to a person named Nonno Frankie. He is a person who lives with Paul and Paul's mother. Paul lives with his mom and Nonno Frankie at Victory Boulevard. It doesn't say exactly where he lives in the story. I gave this book 3 stars because the book got really boring during the last half of it."
1,boring and confusing,"This book was so boring. Sorry, but it was. It just wasn't like a ""normal"" book. It was very confusing. In the beginning it sounded nice and good but as you got further it was soooo boring. And it's not a funny book. (to me I think it isn't). I mean, it's just out of place! It's not like a real story where it goes in order and something happens and you continue on and on. It's not like that. But, I think this was boring. real boring."

5,a book with great insights regarding humans personal matters,The book is very well written and interesting. It is of great help to all adults of narcissistic parents / families. Alice Miller gives support and understanding to the grown-up that wants to be in control of his own life. The truth also allows advance in emotional growing. Highly recommended for parents as a tool to improving communication with their children and progressing the intent of raising loving and caring children.
4,The Best Soap Dish!,I finally broke my first dish (of this same product) after having it for about four years. It drains the water so the soap doesn't get soft. I would of gave a five star if they would make these is different colors.
4,Delightfully Versatile Guitar Playing,"FOLLOWING A DREAM is a true melting pot of musical expression. Songwriting highlight... ""Going Through The Motions"" (track 3) for its trippy acid country rock feel, very original. Guitar playing highlight... the killer slide solo in ""Forget To Forget You"" (track 5). Lyrical highlight... consistent throughout the entire CD -- don't forget to read your insert. And you are sure to enjoy ""You Affect Me II"" (track 14)... a jazzy instrumental reminiscent of Wes Montgomery. Talented songwriting blended with tastefully aggressive and delightfully versatile guitar playing is the reason FOLLOWING A DREAM is a real treat to listen to. -Jaimie D. Travis, LadySixString.com, 01.29.03"
5,Shadow is my favorite anime character!!,Shadow is the best! He sounds cool in both english and japanese! Well if you don't believe me then buy this DVD and see it for your self.
4,Ci,"Beautifully filmed, really nice camera angles and beach scenes.The story line is good enough to keep your interest.Nice."
3,sad sad sad,"A friend of mine said to me one day, you know most of the movies with gay topic are sad in general. How true. This is the most saddest movie I ever seen about gay relationship. I was so deeply affected by what I have seen that I won't be seeing this movie again. I admired the work of the actress that played the wife in this movie, but the rest of personage was kinda amateur. Don't watch this one if you appreciate your heart in its unbroken state."
3,A good start,"Really wanted to get the updated version however something is better than nothing. Some classic opening lines, easy to convert to your country of location."
5,Mac Dre R.I.P.,U will truly b missed. This is a great CD. My favorite song on it is Get Stupid. All the songs on here r great. If u don't have it yet go and get it along with his other CDs.SAC-TOWN WHAT IT DO!!!!!91SICNESS
3,expensive but works as advertised,"the software is expensive. It is a very functional superset of the free software that comes with Panasonic Cameras. If you are using multiple Panasonic network cameras and their free WEB service (Viewnetcam.com), This allows you to monitor your cameras from any internet connection."
3,Watch After You Read The Short Story by Joyce Carol Oates,"I found this after having read the short story ""Where Are You Going Where Have You Been?"" by Joyce Carol Oates. The story is so-o-o-o-o-o-o much better, but it was nice to see the characters brought to life. I read the story in high school and then again in college....still freaks me out. Oates was ahead of her time."
2,A mediocre attempt at giving background information,"The main problem of this DVD was the overreliance on the movie for everything. The historical data was good and interesting but frequent use of movie cutscenes ruined any atmosphere. This DVD attempted to be both a behind-the-scenes featurette and a documentary and pretty much failed as both to be interesting and watchable.The format of the DVD was a ""Question and Answer"" and short simplified answers were given (though some were good) that was in total 53 minutes long. The special features consisted of old news reel stories and propaganda (which had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor) with a short explanatory info blurb tacked on. $ for this seems totally unrealistic.I personally recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! as being more consistant and enjoyable."
5,radical discipleship,"""I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."" (John 16:33) In The Signature of Jesus, Brennan Manning teaches us all what radical discipleship looks like: the Cross of Christ. It is a great book about following Jesus. If your load is heavy and your strength is beginning to fail, I recommend the first thing you do is rest in Jesus' power and strength; then get this book. It'll give you some reasons to get up and keep on keepin on; and in so doing, share not only in the Cross of Christ, but also His overcoming of the world."
1,Good God...,"A fifty year old man playing tag? This presents Chakotay/Seven as a reaction to a midlife crisis. This novel was mediocre, the C/7 just plain bad."
5,NOT FOR PC's ! ! ! !,"Intel ethernet adapters are top sellers for good reason. They work!Be aware - this particular model is for servers!!! it has a very short mounting plate and is not designed for pc's. Of course does make the Pro 1000 GT for PC's but this is not the one. I made it work for my pc because i am handy with sheet metal tools but be aware.Once the bracket was handled and the card was installed, it is flawless in performance and the network management tools that are downloadable from intel are fantastic."
4,facing up to the book,"over all it's a good book, a definite help for those of us who are fans of the Doctor, and are curious to know about the lost stories. Not the most brilliant ever written, but a definitely entertaining read."
2,Not Pleased,"I purchased the DVD based on reviews here. I love Bluegrass music, but this movie was terrible. It could have been made as a high scholl project. Consists mostly of interviews with 3 or 4 musicians, very little complete music. A good portion of the movie is Bill Monroe walking through an old house looking at nails in the wall, doors falling off the hinges and other such nonsense. I can't understand why it received such good reviews."
1,High Lonesome-The story of Bluegrass Music,Very disappointed with the quality of the DVD. I had to return it for a refund.
5,Great,"I am so glad I ran across this value, my grandson loves the Power Rangers no matter which one. Will definitely look for more."
4,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...This only thing stopping this collection from a solid 5 star rating is the fact that it includes remixes and some b-sides. Therefore, it ends up being a must have for fans missing some great tracks and too much for someone wanting an overview of Beth Orton's great music."
4,Okay If You Like Short Games!,"First off, this game is kind of fun but.....its a real short game!!!!!!!!I bought this game on Mon. June 12 and beat it the next day, Tues. June 13!!!!!So, the game is fun but...ITS SO SHORT!!!! So the bottom line is...DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!It is a big waste of $30.00.I hope this was helpful.Sincerely,Fed up and $30.00 short"
4,jack black,I tried looking everywhere for this stuff and it was sold out! i wanted to get it for my boyfriend for christmas..so he hasnt used it yet cause its a xmas gift..but it must be pretty good since it was sold out almost everywhere!
3,Good For Liberal Arts Students Overview Class,"I read the previous reviews and bought the book only to be disappointed. I felt like many of the topics such as computer art was outdated since the pubishing date of 2001. I liked the overview of the history of art education and why we need it, but I knew that already. I guess that I felt it was a little like preaching to the choir. The book was 99% pedagogy and 1% examples of practical examples of instruction. To me a visual art education book needs to have a lot of visual art examples. I see this book as more of a textbook for a new teacher in a credential program or in the one art education class liberal arts majors take. It would offer good discussion topics about the place art education will hold in their classrooms."
4,Great Product,"This system is great. I love it because it saves on so much space not having to store all those DVD cases in my living room. My only thing is the place to write all the movie titles is a little awkward. I do see the new versions have a pull out tray for the movie titles, which would be better. This is a great item, though, and I would definitely purchase another one."
2,*RIPOFF!* *cough cough*,"How the author wrote this book:* Hmm. I want to write an Egyption-alien-thing book but don't know where to start. Need source material. * Search TV/Movie: Stargate * Find: Stargate, Stargate SG-1 * Wow, this is good stuff. Not just alter the script.. throw in metapsychical... ah, yes, take some from other books.. PERFECT!Notably the poor person who wrote this book was trying to buy all the SG-1 books. :P So if your an SG-1 fan looking for a good laugh, you might just be the unintended target audience."
3,Just not what I was looking for,"Well, I must admit to some disappointment with this book...let me explain.This book came highly recommended by bookstore personnel and after reading the reviews on the dust cover and at amazon.com I decided to buy it.While initially, I found the book humorous with its typical British style of dry wit, I soon became aware of an impending sense of deja vu. I found myself returning to thoughts of those early and dreaded grammar school lessons (at which I did very poorly) From thereon the book became tedious and difficult to read and enjoy. I was back in school and this book was really a teaching manual; something to be studied and learned, i.e work. I could not finish it.The other interesting thing was that two friends who saw this book sitting on the table and borrowed it, ended up with the same impression as I did. (and the same unfinished result)Obviously, some people loved this book (see other reviews) but it was not what I was looking for."
2,Condescending vs. Educational,"When I read this book I had but one feeling. Guilty! Maybe it was my guilty conscious, or maybe it was the condescending tones that rang throughout this book. Some of the funny stories may have helped me to remember a couple of the rules. For the most part this book is a compilation of the author's complaints about people like me. I wouldn't recommend this book as a teaching aid, nor would I recommend it for its humor. I'm honestly not sure what I would recommend this book for."
1,"Cute for the UK, useless for the US","I am sorry that I followed the hype in the UK when this came out. It is a cute read for British English but gets tiresome fast.The Sunday NY Times review put it better than I could -too late - I'd bought it - the book is unfunny and, to my dismay, unhelpful - in fact, wrong, since it is British punctuation and of little help in the US. I'll save it for my next trip to the UK.While nice to punctuate properly, it's better to have something to say and say it with skill and grace."
3,GASP Who would've thought that punctuation could be boring?,"When I first picked up this book, I was very hopeful that it would be full of funny anectodes about punctuation and its misuse. Instead, the book is full of questionably unfunny and definitely unrelated events that only sort of illustrate rather simple rules of punctuation (e.g. it's vs. its).The only redeeming feature of this work is the few examples of misuse of commas yielding wrong and sometimes contradictory meanings. I wish Truss would have focused on this chapter and provided more such examples as they were at some point almost entertaining.In retrospect, if you are looking for a book on language that is interesting to read, please see Bill Bryson's ""The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way"". If you are looking for a book on language that teaches you how to use it, please refer to any of your primary school textbooks."
3,A LAUGH PER PAGE,"A cute little book with some fun prose, and a lot of confusion and differences of opinion about punctuation. It's the British way or the Truss way, but often doesn't help us across ""the pond."" She did get me thinking about sentence and paragraph structure, and probably more confused. The book did help me with apostrophes and the dashes, and it also reassured me to know that my high school English teacher was not always right. It's good to know that there are many different ways of punctuating, as long as the message gets across clearly. So there, Ms Langley! Would I buy the book again? Yep! (did I use that exclamation point properly?)"
1,"Read, Trash and Toss: Taking a Joke Too Far","As someone who often comments on the misplaced punctuation and bad grammar, I received this book as a gift. After reading of the author's call to arms to correct all of those wayward souls, I had to stop and ask myself: how can I retain my feeling of elitism if all mistakes in punctuation are abolished? While the idea is funny, and would make a fun article, an entire book of complaints grated on my nerves. If anything, this book taught me that maybe I should keep my mouth shut once in awhile--constantly correcting people must be awfully annoying!"
2,Doesn't live up to title,"This work is a terrible disappointment. The text does not live up to the delightful title.First. The punctuation rules are for the UK and differ significantly from what is considered correct USA punctuation. Sadly, most readers will be ignorant of the distinction and spread such errors as placing periods and commas after closing quote marks (more-or-less the British system).The author was given a witty title, but counterbalances that with dull prose. She often contradicts herself by not following her own rules. She claims that the erudite New Yorker magazine adds an apostrophe to number plurals (1990's and not the correct 1990s). The actual perpetrator of this error is The New York Times.Enough said."
4,Brings on Insecurity,"This was a great book, but I'm not going to write too much in this review. I'm too worried about my punctuation. I read it last week and I've already forgotten half the misuses of which I'm guilty. Now, whenever I write something, I find myself feeling insecure about my punctuation all the time! 'Nuff said."
1,Cure for insomnia,"I cannot believe I wasted hours reading this book - hours that I will never be able to get back. The author's style is pompous, self-important and condescending. I agree with the other reviews and advise you to first check it out at the library for a test drive."
1,Buyer Beware,This CD does not have the content of the book. This CD is very short and only contains some broadcast radio segements.
4,Highly enjoyable and informative,"I am somewhat nervous in writing this particular review. Not only do I feel compelled to compose these thoughts using only the choicest of words; I also realize that one does not want to make any grammatical errors when opining about a book which concerns punctuation and usage of the English language. Look! See! I just used the word ""opining"" in my review. And, oh, dear, was my usage of exclamation points correct? Obviously, I am being intimidated. Let me move quickly on to my point: Truss has written a marvelous little book that refreshes the reader in the importance of punctuation. However, this book is far from a weighty, preachy tome. It is actually quite witty and delightful. Anyone who writes, or who enjoys good writing, should read this book."
3,"A quickly read, entertaining book","This book on grammar is not meant to be a reference book or a writer's guide. Instead, it is a book of vignettes. It is like having dinner with your retired great aunt who used to be a grade school English teacher. The voice is similar as is the amount of time required to read the book. Enjoy the monologue and diatribe. Laugh at the stories. Cringe at her snobbery and old-fashioned attitudes. But don't expect to find handy writing tips."
5,"Hilarious, fun and smart","I decided not to use the Oxford comma in my title. This small little book by Lynn Truss is delightful, informative and oh-so-very-funny. Her snarky impatience and (duly admitted) neurotic round-up of punctuation rules, regulations and crimes is worth reading more than once and would make a great gift. Thank you, Lynn!"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book on the advice of a co-worker thinking it would be a reference book for writers; I was surprised to find it to be more a personal story with writing references buried within.The author Lynne Truss, a British woman, writes well but injects an ever so slight hint of aristocracy and snobbishness toward the masses. In one particular story, she relates receiving a pen pal letter from an 8th grade girl from Detroit. The girl's writing was juvenile and poor and Ms. Truss replied in a condescending manner to put the girl in her proper place (grammatically). Ms. Truss states she feels bad about doing so, but reading between the lines, one senses a triumphant pleasure in telling that American girl how she borders on illiteracy.If you think this book will be a ready desk reference and aid you while writing, think again and look elsewhere. If however, you want an easy read with personal anecdotes of one woman's obsession with punctuation, this book may be for you."
1,View from the classroom,"As a secondary school teacher for longer than I care to admit, I am delighted to see that a subject as staid as grammar can excite even adults. Kudos to this book for demonstrating that fact. But what a shame that the book has so little bearing on the way we use English in America - and has grammatical errors as well. Read this only for entertainment, but use authoritative sources if you intend to write or speak as Americans do."
1,Let the buyer beware.,"Truss's book is a disappointment for Americans who love the subtleties of grammar, punctuation, and good editing. Her inconsistent picking and choosing of the rules makes no sense. A warning for students: do not buy this book as a guide, and don't follow its examples when writing your papers unless you wish to see a sea of red markings along the margins. You'd be better off with Strunk & White or the unfailing Chicago Manual of Style. In all fairness to the author, this book reflects British, not U.S., grammar."
1,"Writes, Sells, and Profits . . . from one joke","The joke is the catcher here. People buy this book thinking clever jokes will help them learn proper punctuation. But Truss herself makes several punctuation errors in this book. And differences of opinion about correct punctuation exist among editors all over this country and Great Britain. What to do? Read Strunk and White's Elements of Style. Read Louis Menand's review of Truss in The New Yorker. Study the punctuation style in a text for the audience you wish to impress. OK, you can read the back of Truss' book for the joke. Just don't buy it."
3,What about the Ampersand?,"Based upon the publicity, I thought we'd get a pot pourri of examples of poor grammar in published material, but in fact there were few examples of this.As it says on the flyleaf, this is indeed a book for people who love punctuation and get upset about it.However, it can seem over-long in places. 33 pages on the Apostrophe was interesting, but 35 pages on the comma was exhausting & exhaustive. The colon, semicolon, dash, brackets, ellipsis, italics, exclamation mark, question mark, hyphen & emoticons all feature to good effect - but the ampersand was nowhere to be seen?4* for the idea, and 3* for the result.If you want to more readily know what to do when, I recommend the Style Guide from the Economist."
3,Informative + Entertaining,"Lynne Truss brings an obscure element of language to the fore and in doing so exposes some of the effects of unbridled change in the name of progress. Her second book ""Talk to the Hand"" is even better."
1,PT Barnum said it...,"One born every minute. People in the United States are buying a British Grammar book and think they are learning something - one that is not so well done?Sorry, there are truly good works out there. This not one of them, not for UK, especially NOT for USA. Another case of flash over substance."
4,More Droll than Elements of Style,Droll British humor seems to be as much the point of this book as an examination of the many misuses of punctuation. The differences between British and American standard punctuation at times made reading this book as disorienting as driving in Brittan. Great fun to read while brushing up on some very fine points of grammar.
5,meaning of enormity,"I apologize that I have not read the book, although it does sound interesting. I just had to comment that, even in the United States, enormity implies wickedness. Anyone who uses the word to refer only to magnitude is incorrect."
4,Shot while eating leaves,"I am a grammar and punctuation buff, having taught the stuff many years ago, and I found the book to be a refreshing approach to the whole business which apparently has been put on the far back burner. Our culture obviouslyy doesn't know how to puctuate and, furthermore, shrugs it off as unimportant. The first half of the book is especially refreshing; the last goes slower. I keep lending my copy out to friends who delight in it."
5,Great book!,"This book is not for everyone, but if you're a stickler for using the right words with the right punctuation, then this is for you! I loved it!"
5,"Stickler's, unite! A great book...",I am a born stickler. I am passionate about written communication and even more passionate about clarity within that communication. It is great to know that there are other people in the world who see signs in shop windows that appear to be written by people who failed to pay attention in all the years they went to grade school. I have actually carried a Sharpie and corrected blatantly poor punctuation and grammar. This book is fantastic and incredibly humorous. The author has that fantastic British wit and it makes the book much like reading a script from a Monty Python sketch in places. I highly recommend this book and the fact that it became a bestseller gives all of us sticklers hope!
2,Mayor of Central Park,"I couldn't get into this book at all,but many of my students read it and really liked it. This was an Avi unit in 4th grade."
5,Ten seeds,"Very cute and sturdy. A youbg boy plants ten seeds, which, one by one, are eaten are destroyed in some manner. All except for one seed that grows into a glorious sunflower, which produces exactly ten seeds. A definite summer hit for the young set."
5,A gem,"I've read thousands of children's books and this is in the top 10. I visit schools on a regular basis and, besides the books I've written, this is the only book I've ever read. True, I'm a sucker for books that entertain and teach, but it's rare when it works really well. The bonus: it introduces an important concept of how nature works."
4,kansas pacific,"kansas pacific dvd great movie, lots of action, recommend it for others to buy, this is one I can see again and enjoy"
5,IF THEY'RE THIS GOOD ALREADY....,"...I'm excited to hear what's in store for the future!! Amazingly talented and I love that I can actually hear and understand the words!! Phatty beats that aren't repetitive cause Grinder just changes it up! Definitely the 1st in a long line of more good, refreshing music to come! (did I mention how much fun this CD is to listen to in the car?!)"
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, and was initially entranced by both the characters and the atmosphere, especially the evocation of a dark and damp landscape and the claustrophobia it induces in those unaccustomed to it. I live in such a landscape myself now after many years in a sunnier clime, and thought this part of the novel most effective. But occasionally the author overreaches in her descriptions, and suddenly one is very much aware that this is a NOVEL, in exactly the same way that a bad line reading will suddenly remind you it's only a movie. Nonetheless I persevered, even staying up until 2 a.m. to finish. And that was the real disappointment: the ending is both formulaic and ambiguous, as if a sustained arc ended in a small thud. Now, days later, I wonder why I allowed these disagreeable characters to enter my life!"
2,"Plates & bowls OK, mugs not so much.","As other reviewers have noted, the dots don't look as good as they could. The colors are dulled by the fact that dots are printed on top of each other, and some are misaligned. What is so disappointing to me is the fact that the mugs have lost most of the color of their dots. I hadn't realized, when I ordered this set from another retailer, that the mugs were not also made of Corelle vitreous glass, but stoneware. They are sturdy enough, but I don't use them when I have guests because they look awful."
2,Had these for about 3 years,I have had these dishes for about 3 years....and they did not hold up after time. I bought these because I thought they would be durable. They chip easily. They are not durable.
3,Decent,The main card was good; but I judge cards from top to bottom. The prelims was what gives this event three stars overall.
2,"Good start, but disappointing overall","I absolutely adored the description of the author's near-death experience. It is one of the best I have ever read. However, I don't think the techniques she recommends for replicating one's own NDE will work to the extent implied in the title and intro. Sure, maybe one can have an out-of-body experience in a dream, but that is a far different experience than the one she had when she ""died,"" when she went to a supreme heavenly place and felt total joy and bliss. I thought the connection she made between the two was a bit of a stretch."
2,Not Worth it,"These weren't even as good as the speakers on my lap top. Very little volume, tone quality not bad."
1,Useless,Do not working for me. I have use even double the dose. Finished 100 caps. Absolutely no effect on my prostate symptoms!
4,Works for me...,"After trying several other herbs and supplements, I was glad to find one that works fairly well. Combined with Saw Palmetto, it has been a very satisfactory product. I liked the price, too."
1,"Side effects, dosage, recommended preparation","I have taken this for 5 days now and after developing heartburn that nothing can tame, and abdominal pain I did more research into this product. Those are pretty standard side effects for this.So the dosage listed is two capsules, twice daily which amounts to 2 grams of pure bark. Most studies have shown that 50-100mg of standardized pygeum extract daily is the effective dose, however since this is just straight bark, it's difficult to know how much of the active components you are getting.Basically, I'm going to stop taking this preparation, and find something that is a standardized extract and see if I get the same side effects. This could be a fine product, but I think the quantity they want you to take is too much."
1,incompatible with iphone,"I bought this car charger for my iphone.When i try to use it . Everytime i get the below alert on iphone""This accessory is not made to work with iPhone. ....""It will notify that this part is not for the iPhone and ask if you would like to enter ""Airplane Mode"".Push the cancel button and the iPhone will begin to charge.It is annoying to see that alert everytime while using car charger"
3,Disappointing,"I originally did not see that this was a travel kit. It was a note at the bottom of the ad for this item instead of being noted in the item heading. Excellent quality accessories and case but small even for a travel kit and a bit pricey.You might be able to polish children's shoe with the brushes, but adult shoes would be a chore."
5,Value for money,I have been using 4 units of this at my home for >12 months. Its a good looking inexpensive towel ring.The only down side is the ring itself is not very sturdy and can be yanked out of the casing if you apply more than the necessary force.
2,Where's the single track?,"This is a collection of mostly oddball rides done by the author of several of Falcon Press' hiking guides. He seems to prefer too many long rides through the trees on washboardy forest service dirt roads without much of a mountain bike feel to them. You can do most of the rides in a car. There needs to be more attention to what mountain bikers really like . . . carving single track trail with varied surface over interesting terrain (i.e. some rough, some rocky, some steep, some smooth and some easy), views, cool destinations and more loop rides. Nice try for a first edition. However, the author is not really a mountain biker, just a hiker taking a stab at what he thinks mountain bikers would like. Ho-hum."
5,Awesome Job Kel!!,"Kelly's first full length cd is GREAT!! As a singer myself, and also sharing the same name...""Kelly"" I can't help but think that K.O. is awesome, I mean really, who doesn't love her?? From her fashion sense, to her hair, to her taste in music Kelly has started a new wave throughout teens all over the world...she has taught us to be confident and hapy with who we are, not to mention to be tough,strong, and to not give a sh!t about anyone elses shallow minded oppinions. Her CD is full of punk/pop tunes that you ca't help but love. Kelly Osbourne is the voice of a new generation, and this CD is our music!"
4,Not As Bad As I Feared...,"Ok well i'm not gonna brown nose i'll admit after watching the show my impression of Kelly was...spoiled brat...and while i can't say that my opinion has changed...after listening to most of the album i can safely say that...HER MUSIC ROCKS!!...no she doesn't have Celine Dion range but who the hell cares...the same people dogging her lack of range are the same people that write reviews whining that Celine's vocals give them a headache...safe to say some people just want to b----....anyway the standout tracks on this record are ""Disconnected"", ""Come Dig Me Out"", and ""More Than Life Itself"" worth the money...i downloaded it to to screen after what i've heard i have no hold backs on buying it...and you shouldn't either.....KELLY, ROCK ON BABY"
3,Ehh...,"Well, I got this CD for Christmas and I listened to it and I absolutley loved it. Then I listened to it again and I realized that most of the songs suck. My personal favorites are ""Come Dig Me Out"" and ""Coolhead"". Songs like ""Disconnected"" and ""Right Here"" make it seem like Kelly is trying too hard to be 'punk'. It doesn't come as natural as other artists. And not to mention the 'ballad', the last song on the album ""More Than Life Itself"". This song should have been replaced with the single ""Papa Don't Preach"" or maybe the Andrew WK duet ""She Is Beautiful"". MTLI is the worst ballad I have ever heard, it's truly pathetic. All and all It's worth your fifteen bucks, and if you want a good laugh, listen to ""More Than Life Itself"""
1,Kelly should take her own advice.,Please...Do what your album title says. It would make the world a better place.
2,judge this book by it's cover,"this cd is cute. it's over produced, and marketed, but what do you expect? you will be pleased with this cd if you don't expect it to be anything more than it sets out to be. she's an 18 year old spoiled brat who wanted to make an album. her voice isn't bad. i think it's avril levigne-esque, but pop-ier, which i think is easier to take. it sounds pretty good, all things considered..."
3,Ehh...,"Okay, musically, the album is great. Lyrically and vocally, this album sucks. Honestly, Kelly CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT sing! The last track, ""More Than Life Itself"" is so pathetic. It sounds like a bad version of karaoke. My parakeet could sing better than Kelly did on that track!"
1,Tell me?,"Why do sites like this one want more for ""Shut Up"" then ""Changes."" Changes is a re-release of shut up and has more for less!!! I just don't get it? Anyway did anyone else see her on celebrities uncensored 7 she looked so dazed and angry. How many times does this girl have to perform live on T.V. 7 8 9 times before people consider her a serious artist!."
4,Excellent!,"I bet you wont like this album at the first listen, but if you listen to it several times it would definately grow on you.Best Songs on there are definately ""Come Dig Me Out"", ""Coolhead"", ""Shut Up"", and ""More THan Life Itself"", the other tracks are all good too though. My Advice is if you liked ""Papa Dont Preach"" get this album right away!"
1,Talent not required,"This is 100% proof of what's wrong with music today. This girl can't sing to save her life and yet she gets a record deal and infinite rotation on mtv. How you ask? It's simple, she has connections. Seeing as her father is a music legend and icon. This is a testament to the awful and pathetic state the music industry is in today. You want to know who's to blame for making music so horrible these days? MTV and American radio. Those two are the main culprits. If you have a brain you'll stay clear of the two."
1,Industry,"That this record should be released when Jon Brion's ""Meaningless"" sat on a shelf for a year...great Christ. Or how ABOUT Sean Lennon's debut? What a beautiful record! And how many units did it sell? Just over 61,000. We're talking about the SON of JOHN LENNON, folks; why didn't MTV provide the push for him? Well, of course we all know.What's to be said beyond all this? Watered down quasi-riotgrrl ill-informed capital-E Embarrassingly ""rebellious."" Who called this power pop? Howzabout Big Star or The Faces? Or eels? Or The Rolling Stones? Wake up. Please, Christ -- just wake up."
5,SHUT UP,"Shut up to anyone who ever thought Kelly Osbourne was just one of Ozzy's kids. She can SING, and I don't know how this CD will be on the radio, but I LOVE this CD and every song on it. Great ballad of ""More Than Life Itself"". I love it all! You can bet I will be buying her next album!"
5,"getting to know you, getting to know all about you.","this book is a must read for anyone sincerely searching self knowledge. it covers much ground regarding the magnificence of life and existence itself. breathtakingly deep and broad in its scope: personal experience of ""God"", ways to find ""God"". the validity of personal mystical experience, ways of getting there, the reason evil exists, the nature of ultimate good, the list goes on and on. Stanislav Grof is a master of the transpersonal and speaks ""as one having authority"". i can't possibly rate this book highly enough. buy it! its a feast for the mind as well as the heart."
1,Previous fan,"Another dissappointment. I'm glad I borrowed this book and didn't buy one. I've read every book she's written. The first was really great and the second almost as good...but from then on things went downhill fast.I kept buying in hopes that she would get back to where she started...with interesting cases and even more interesting solves. It hasn't happened. The characters have lost their appeal, the story line is weak and the ending on this book was really lame. It's time for Cornwell to return to medicine full time."
2,What Happened?,"A very disappointing book.Having read all the previous Scarpetta novels with the exception of Blow Fly, I was expecting a lot more. This felt very much like a quickly written, advance-money driven novel. If you have not read ALL of the Scarpetta novels, read them first, they are far more satisfying than this shallow effort."
2,"More aptly titled ""Not a Trace""","Unlike many reviews, I really enjoyed Blow Fly, as well as all of the other Kay Scarpetta books; however, this one was a drudgery to read. She got bogged down in the minutia of forensic details, which became very boring and cumbersome. The plot was very poorly developed as were the characters. How exciting in her last book to find out that Benton is still alive. I couldn't wait to get this book and have their relationship continue. They didn't even interact until the very last chapter!! Since this is the first of her Scarpetta series that I truly did not enjoy, I will give them another chance. I'd love to see her bring back ""Le Loup Garou""--the werewolf. I thought he was a great and interesting villain. I just hope we can expect better next time."
2,Trace,"This is the last Scarpetta book I'll be reading. I loved the early books in the series, but the story lines are old and just boring. The arch-criminal going after the hero made a good story 15 years ago, but every other crime novel rolls out this tired theme along with all the TV crime shows, from all the CSI type dramas to and including The Mentalist and Criminal minds. Lets get real the last thing REAL criminals want is to be caught and getting involved with a law enforcement person is the furthest thing on their agenda. This book would be great on CDs abridged down to 2 or 3 disks.It is time for novelists and crime show write to come up with a new theme or just get back to the good old Jack Webb story line of there's a crime, investigate, catch the criminal. For these writers it seems that there are ""no new ideas under the sun."""
3,"Procedural and political stuff is good, rest of it forgettable","This Cornwell effort is clearly below the level of her first few books, which I have read. I haven't read her real clunkers that evidently preceded ""Trace."" Briefly, I thought the Lucy/Henri plot was a self-indulgent slog, but the rest of the book -- the central murder of a young girl in the Richmond area -- showed Cornwell and Scarpetta near their best, employing forensic evidence in new and creative ways. I am generally not thrilled with murder mysteries that show the bad guy doing his bad things in the first few chapters, and naming him, but other readers seem to like that sort of stuff. A clear three stars."
1,In the Desert With Only Hot Tap Water To Drink!,"One word aptly describes ""Trace"". FORGETTABLE.!Trace lost its way painfully early, it was saturated with the personal issues and drama of Kay Scarpetta, her niece Lucy and detective Marino. What happened to the case the book was supposed to be based on? Well, it seemed to be highlighted as an afterthought intermittently throughout the book. A waste of precious trees especially with this book being over 500 pages. What happened Patricia Cornwell?"
2,Not as good as previous books,"I love Patricia Cornwell books, but was disappointed by this one. It seemed as though there was alot of information left out and the ending was rushed. I didn't feel that the conclusion was reached as a logical progression of the story. It was interesting that very specific details of the new ME were revealed, then he was pretty much not mentioned for the rest of the book. Is there another book which explores his quirks?? Also, it was odd that the subject of Lucy being homosexual is never actually stated in the book, only ""hinted"" at. This book does not have the feel of previous books."
2,Y-a-w-n-n-n-n-n-n-n,"Much of this book is tedious. I used to rank Patricia Cornwell among my favorite authors, but the last few books have been slow and repetitive. This one is no exception, so tedious that the plot is nearly lost. It does get better in the second half, though. Cornwell uses an odd combination of present tense and third person omniscient. She frequently uses ""and"" to tie together otherwise separate sentences. I think the idea is to mimic stream of consciousness, but instead it just seems like poor grammar. The style is disconcerting and detracts from the plot. The plot itself is fairly preposterous - too many unlikely scenarios and connections. The two books before Trace were also both blah and painful to read (I didn't bother to finish either one). I wish she would pick up the action of her earlier style!"
2,Trace,"I am a big Kay Scarpetta fan, but was disapointed with this book. It definitely doesn't hold up in suspense to her previous ones, and it's a shame."
4,A little slow for a Kay Scarpetta Mystery,"This book was a little slow for a KS Mystery, but it was plenty twisted. The perp definitely had ""issues""."
1,Kay Scarpetta D.O.A.,"The real shame here is that we all grew to love the Scarpetta novels of the past. The characters were strong, the plots exciting, and the writing was great. It was truly painful to try and get through this mess. I finally had to close the book when I got to the part where Scarpetta gave Marino a genital exam in his hotel room. I can't imagine what Ms. Cornwell was thinking as she abused these much-loved characters -- not to mention her fans. It's finally over for me. Kay Scarpetta is D.O.A. Onward now to Kinsey Millone, Harry Bosch, and Alex Cross."
2,What happened P.C.?,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell mysteries and I have to say this one must have been written by a 'ghost writer'. As usual the plot began with it's usual suspense,but after the situations were set there was not much follow-through (at times none)!Many characters were created only to fade into the pages, like the new Chief and his fear of garbage trucks, what was its relevance to the case? What about Tina, did she play a part in anything? Even Marino's parts were scattered.What happened P.C. your heart really wasn't in this one. Only two stars for a good beginning."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Do not waste your money buying this book! I was very confused after I finished reading it. I thought I'd give Ms. Cornwall another chance after Blow Fly, but that's it. Get this book out of the library instead of spending your money. Just sloppy and poorly written. Also, why is she all of a sudden referring to Kay in third person? I liked it much better when she referred to Kay as in the first."
3,"Elegant writing, plodding plot","There's no denying Cornwell's writing style is first rate. But, once again, the plot drags. There is no ""flash point"" to get things rolling, none of the intense action of her earlier books, and the characters seem stuck in dullsville. Once again, Lucy is angry (why?) and has made unwise choices in her life. For someone who is supposedly brilliant, she seems to be constantly floundering. Marino is portrayed as flippant and angry and also makes some extremely poor choices. Scarpetta gets mouse-trapped into assisting in an investigation back on her old turf without even bothering to ask a few basic questions about this apparently problematic case. And then not much happens until Scarpetta conveniently remembers her old employee. Oh please."
1,cornwell crashes,"this lady sure do love her adverbs. along with the artificially hyped angst and muddled story lines, cornwell seems to have a poor grasp of plot developement and grammer. nobody ever just does or says something---they do or say it quietly, softly, cutely, sweetly, ad nauseum. this is my first and last cornwell book. when there are so many good authors out there, why do publishers continue to promote bad writers like p. cornwell?"
2,Really???,"WOW! After reading Blow Fly, a book I absolutely enjoyed despite the ending (see review), this was a disappointment to say the least. There must be a missing manuscript somewhere between Blow Fly and Trace because there were a lot of missing answers at the end of Blow Fly and even more created during Trace. It appears it is a a few years down the road from Blow Fly and everyone is doing something different with unapproached resolutions/issues from Blow Fly to today with no explanations.... I felt really like I lost an entire book somewhere... Very disappointing run between books! Hoping ""Predator"" will bring some of this together..."
2,Disappointed in Rhode Island,I was a true Scarpetta fan but this one was a dissapointment. The story line was like riding a roller coaster. It brought you up and let you down time and again. No more Kay for me.
1,I give up on Patricia Cornwell,"I have read all of the Scarpetta series but Trace will be my last one. I was alternately bored and infuriated. I agree with other reviewers that too many questions were left up in the air. I never figured out why the killer killed Gilly - did I miss something? And what was the deal with the dog. Lots of questions unanswered. What really annoys me though is the total disfunction of each character. In Cornwell's world no one is ever happy. These characters now make you want to smack them and say ""Quit whining and get a life!"" Kay has become her own worst enemy as has Lucy and reading about their constant angst is just getting downright boring. They are their own worst enemies and I am beginning to think they deserve what they get.Don't waste your time or money on this."
2,Go back to your roots,"I have always enjoyed the Scarpetta books, but lately Ms. Cornwell seems to have forgotten what got her fame as an author. The last 2 books started all right, got slow and then sloppy and then she tried to tie everything up in a few paragraphs with no other explanations. What happened to Kay and Wesley's love, Lucy's brillance and Marino's ""do it my way"" attitude? What happened to the new ME and his panic-attacks and what happened to Jack Fielding? The Wolf-Man is still on the loose and yet there was no mention of that in this book. We have never had any real insight to Lucy's TLP or what Kay and Marino are really doing since leaving Richmond. Marino's losing weight and trying to get healthy, but, did he grieve over his son's death. Part of the fun of continuing stories is tying them together. This book almost completly forgets Blow Fly and begins over."
1,More about Cornwell?,"I had the feeling throughout this book that Cornwell's move to Fl/NY stirred up something in VA and she is getting even. In the great Scarpetta novels, Va is an exciting place to be and crime solving is an art. In this, there is a broken down system. All she?/Scarpetta created in VA is seemingly destroyed by mismanagement. The story seems subserviant venting for reasons unknown on the state. There is much extraneous material and unresolved questions as other reviewers have noted.I think the work Cornwell is doing on Diana and Jack the Ripper and any other real life cases may well be where her present talent and energy is taking her. Obviously she through Scarpetta has no good feelings about Richmand."
1,Downhill slide for Scarpetta continues.....,"I'm so disappointed with this book and the previous two as well. Has Patricia Cornwell forgotten how to write? Has she lost interest with this character? If so, maybe it's time for Scarpetta to retire.The plot in this book was so disjointed and muddled, it was a chore to read.There was a time when I couldn't put down Cornwell's books, but after the last several I don't think I'll be picking up any future offerings."
1,no trace of talent,"i have read ALL of the scarpetta novels, and the last two are both horrible. even worse than blow fly, trace is written in fragmented perspectives and contains the most abhorrent use of the passive voice in my recollection to date. not only full of was, is, has been, and are, cornwell somehow manages to repeat the same adjectives in one sentence. most of us acknowledge that a woman who looks horsey possesses a horsey face... arent there other words to use? the book meanders through another dull plot and once rich characters fall flat. i often wonder why i bothered continuing after the second page."
2,Just OK,"Nowhere near the excellence of the beginning of the series, but better than Blowfly (I know, that's not saying much). We do see at least a pale version of ""the old Scarpetta"", although I wish Ms. Cornwell would return to the first person narrative which she used so effectively. It appears she is holding Scarpetta at arm's length. In ""Trace"", she tries to juggle too many storylines (the killer, Benton, Lucy, Marino, to name a few) and ends up not doing real justice to any of them. But it is a step up from the last, and maybe she is working on bringing Scarpetta back all the way. I hope."
2,"Oh Patricia, what happened to ye lass ??","I am firmly on the ""waste of time"" side of the critique crowd. This is one of the worst novels I have had the bad fortune to read lately. Ms. Cornwell drones on about Kay Scarpetta being ""dissed"" by the new examiner and it makes me wonder if her character is her alter ego. I waded through the book but it was painful and I don't believe I will attempt another Cornwell novel any time soon."
4,The flu??,I really thought this book would correlate why the little girl who was killed and Henri who was assaulted both had the flu. I thught this was a clue. I really enjoyed the book but I found how Scarpetta could go all over the place collecting evidence in a town that was not in her jurisdiction was hard to believe. I must say I found the book very enjoyable and was a nice sit by the lake and read book. thanks the summer reader
2,Very Disappointed,"I have loved reading Cornwell books over the years and I especially have loved the Scarpetta novels, but this one I just could not get into. It was at times very confusing to me. So sad......."
3,At least it's no Blow Fly,"Trace was a gigantic step up from Blowfly, but still lacks the oomph of earlier works. Things have not been the same since Scarpetta left Richmond--and I miss all those gourmet meals she used to cook.I hate what's become of her relationship with Benton which seems to be all over the map.And Lucy used to be a flesh and blood person, but has become some sort of cardbord cartoon Superwoman that I can't even relate to any more.Maybe I'll just go back and start at the beginning and read the books when they really made you hungry for the next one, not hoping that it won't be a disappointment."
1,Trace by Patricia Cornwell,"I have read every novel Patricia Cornwell has written and I can honestly say, this book is extremely disappointing and dull. The entire book constantly refers back to the past and never truly divulges into the present storyline. Whatever new characters that are introduced seem to disappear into the pages, possibly because they are so boring. In my opinion, the storyline is weak and I didn't feel the usual ""can't put it down without finishing it,"" feeling I have experienced with every other book involving Kay Scarpetta. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,What happened???,"I am appalled at the change in Patricia Cornwell's writing! After reading Blow Fly and Trace, I started rereading some of the earlier books and it's as if a different person wrote the last two books. Why has she chosen to write in the third person at this late stage? It was very effective to be ""inside"" Kay Scarpetta's head but now Cornwell puts us inside the psycho's head!!! I don't want to be there!! Patricia, please, please, please go back to the old way and don't let your publisher rush you!!!!"
1,No more Patricia Cornwell....I give up,"This was worse then her last book. I kept trying to make myself finish the book thinking that at some point the story would actually start. While there was hints of the old books - meaning a lot of forensic information, I miss the early books where there was actually a plot! Beware, the ending has no climax. I think I will pass on the next book - I've been twice burned..."
1,One of the worse books I have read,"This book ranks right up there with her last book ""Blow Fly"", bad!!!I am one of those readers that once I start a book even if it is really bad I have to finish it.I was so frustrated with this book, to many subplots, that didn't make sense. Who was this Henri person... it was not explained until like 3/4 of the way through the book. I kept on trying to remember if I am suppose to know her, and what is Benton doing with her. Things weren't explained every well, and never were. What is up with Dr. Marcus who is now the ME of VA. They talked about him and how weird he is and how he wants to discredit Kay, and then he drops of the face of the ""book"" earth. Why go into all that detail about him, just another example of all the subplots going on. No one is happy, Kay, Marino, Lucy, Rudy, Benton, no one!!!! I think it is a downer of a book, get it cheap on amazon or go to the library. Don't waste your money. I won't be buying another Cornwell book"
1,The worst yet,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books but this was the worst. It was a hard read, boring, easy to put down and hard to pick back up. There was just no substance to the storyline and too much going on that didn't amount to anything. I have been a mystery reader for the last 47 years of my life and it is not often that I have been this disappointed by an author who originally kept me glued to the pages. Very disappointed."
1,Forget it.,"Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door ""wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater"", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct."
3,Better Than Blow Fly......,"This book was better than Blow Fly but even that's not saying much. I used to be a devoted fan of Cornwall, but after these two books, I don't think I'll get my hopes up for her next book. Wait for paperback or go the the library."
1,The same old thing,"Pareicia Cornwell has done it agian. Brought us into a good idea ""Trace evidence"" and ended up with a wordy mismash of several plots which are all conclued without any thinking or understanding of the iea of the plot. The killer is known from the begining and nothing in this book leaves any doubt. The characters, who in the begining of the series where fresh and interesting are now trite and boring. No character knows who they are or what they are doing. A real letdown and it will be a long time before I venture back to reading anything else from Cornwell."
4,All same size,"Right price. I thought different sizes were included, but these are all one size. I reread the ad, and it is accurate, however."
4,Works good for most part,"The valve works as advertised for most part. But sometimes if toilet is flushed in the same bathroom, then the water gets hot in the shower, although the valve should not let that happen"
4,Nice casual accutron,"Overall very happy with the watch! Got it couple of months ago at an excellent price during an Amazon sale - it is worth every penny.Very classy look with casual or jeans - would not venture with a suit though... Feels very solid and transpires excellent quality. I was impressed with the water resistance to 100m (ie can swim, snorkel and light scuba with it) for an automatic watch at this price range (although I did not tested it yet beyond the shower depth;) .Minor complaints - even after the break in period, it is still running fast 15-20 seconds a day, witch it is much worse than the usual ETA mechanism performance. I could get this adjusted but don't want to risk messing the water resistance of the case and besides this is in the tolerable error range for my schedule. The other thing is that it seems to accumulate minor scratches on the bracelet despite wearing it carefully - not unheard of for stainless steel bracelets."
2,"Ugh, they always break",Man I really like the sound these earbuds produce as well as the adjustable sizes which fit so well. They break every friggin time though. I've been through 3 or more pairs and its the same story with each of them. The part of the headphones where the jack meets the wiring gets messed up one way or another and only one of the earbuds will work. You may think you can just take really good care of it and that won't happen to you but believe me it will! I've tried being super careful. I've even tried putting tape around the part the part the headphones where the damage usually occurs so the inner wiring won't come loose. Doesn't work. Maybe Griffin has another pair of earbuds with all of the pluses without the minus of that one problem...
1,wiring fails,"I bought these earbuds as suggested by a co-worker. They are great at reducing the amount of outside sound, so you can hear what you are listening to. I went from listening to my iPod at near full volume to near zero volume by switching to these (from the ear buds that come with the iPod).HOWEVER: Shortly after I bought these, my co-worker apologized for suggesting them, as the wiring failed in his pair. I ALSO had these earbuds for 5 months before the wiring started to fail. First one ear lost sound, then the other...if I wiggle the cord I can get sound every now and then. I am generally very careful and do not believe that they were mistreated, just poorly made."
3,A bit of a let down.,"I love coconut in pretty much any way, shape or form. Given the great reviews these bars have gotten, I couldn't resist getting a couple boxes. Unfortunately, they were a bit of a let down. I was anticipating them to taste like the coconut in a Mounds bar, but they simply taste like generic coconut flakes that have been slightly sweetened and mixed with a bit of paraffin to mold them into bars. Yes, PARAFFIN. Both macaroons and (the coconut in) Mounds bars are noticeably sweeter.They're certainly edible, but given all of the calories in one bar (264 calories / 151 fat calories) I really expected them to taste a bit more decadent and lack the waxy mouth feel."
3,nutritional information,"I am very concerned with the nutritional information. It does not match the packaging. The bar has 264 calories, 16.9 grams of fat - and 14.8 grams of saturated fat - which is 75% for your day! This is not something I could eat on a regular basis at all and I now have a box of 18!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Most of the content is offensive, I personally did not find any of it funny.I expected much more.I've seen better stuff on YouTube, this was disapointing and at times just plain gross."
3,Same Problem,"Just received this bit set from Amazon.com. Regretably, I've found the same problem as other users - the collars for the 7/8"" bearing. I called Freud and they gave me an RMA, but I'm calling again tomorrow to see if they will just send me the bearing with the collars swaged in. The bit is made in Italy, but the bearings come from China and poor comunication may be the problem. To use the system you must keep the diagram that comes with the kit."
1,The truth behind the Book,"The current reviews on this book are well founded against reading the book, not the interrogation effort as a whole. However, the point that must be remembered is that this book is the personal account of a single soldier in the fight against terrorism. I was the Commander for ALL interrogation operations conducted in Afghanistan up until July 2002, and referenced in the book. His accounts are based on true heroes of the HUMINT effort. Everyone must remember that the interrogation effort and HUMINT collection is a joint effort and can not be won through the efforts of a single individual. Also, a point to remember, as stated in the intro, is that the book has been changed in aspects to protect sources and identities. So this means what may seem incorrect is due to that review by the Army. Anyone interested in discussing this, feel free to contact me. stuart.mccall@us.army.mil"
4,Looks good and easy to put together,"We bought this for our new iComfort bed we bought. The item was reasonably priced and quite easy to put together. We have had no problems with it, and quite like the look of it!"
5,twin beds,We got two twin beds. Put together very easily and look great.It is spares for company but they look real nice.
1,This book is a waste of time and money,"I have been homeschooling for years, and when I did a search on books for homeschooling to help with evaluation and narrative reviews, this book came up. I purchased it and I am returning it. The information that is in this book is not specific and you could get more useful information online for free. Even if you are a new homeschooler, this book doesn't provide any more than common sense. Take the money that you would spend on this book and take your kids out to lunch .. it would be better spent."
3,An inferior version without Ethel,"The Judy Garland numbers preserved on the CD show that this would have been a much better movie if she had not been replaced by Betty Hutton, who, while a spunky and attractive actress, just can't sing, I find both her voice and her phrasing decent at best and annoying at worst. Howard Keel is fine, as are the supporting cast, but this is Annie's show, and both the original and revival recordings with the incomparable Ethel Merman are far, far superior. Mediocre sound quality as well."
1,Disappointing,"What could have been one of MGM's best, very simply, is not. While Betty Hutton gamely gives it her all (some times a little too much ""all"") and Keel is perfectly cast, MGM once again massacred the score. One of the best theater songs ever written, I Got Lost In His Arms, was cut. Why?Should have been better than it is, leaves one wondering what might have been had Garland completed the film."
2,not for us,Received prodcut as a gift and was disappointed in quality of fudge. My twin 16 year olds and friends would not eat as they thought it was gritty. If 16 year old would not devour it something is amiss.
4,Mummy Math,"Illustrations are done well, the story line is engaging for children. It keeps them involved in the mystery."
3,Fine but too simple for a 3rd grader,I bought this for a 3rd grader and it is probably more suited for a 1st grader. I think I will donate to my daughters school for use in their 1st grade classes.
4,Cuts easily,"Used this to cut Hardiebacker for a bathroom remodel; It cut well, and I have no complaints. Will be trying it later on Granite."
4,street smarts...summer vibes,"ultra cool fusion of funk, ragga, africana and new york street beats. new wave pioneer who's been neglected till late when uber cool rock fashionista Chloe Sevigny pronounced her summer listening with serious intent on the streets street wise city."
1,Avoid!!!! Avoid!!!!! Avoid!!!!,"This software is TERRIBLE! I bought this software to get a head start on college (after being out of school for 5 years) but now I am back to square one (finding different software, or a book).This program literally expects you to figure out how to do the math by doing it and assuming you can work out the ""why"". But that's okay because the TWO questions at the end of each ""lesson"" will show you step by step how to do it if you click ""solution""...not! Same thing, it shows you the steps but does not EXPLAIN! To put what I am saying simply, imagine trying to learn math by reading somebody's test answers. You can't!I now dread installing a science program I bought from the same company..."
4,good book but can be improved,"This is a good book containing lots of important stuffs. You will find it useful. The two problems are: 1. arrangement of knowledges are not good 2. the language is too hard for a chem background student. For example, the discussion of lattices, I tried several hours on understanding his words but at last I got understood by reading Ashcroft's SSP book in less than one hour.From the book it can be seen that the author is definitively an expert on his field, the only thing he needed is the ability to explain clearly his thoughts."
5,"Celtic Woman - A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle, Ireland","I originally purchased the CD version, but this didn't have all of the songs that were sung in the concert. I purchased the DVD to get the whole concert experience and am not disappointed with the music or video. These 6 women are very talented and entertaining."
5,wonderful,It was a wonderful performance and a well produced DVD. Brought tears to my eyes. Rented it on netflix. Now buying from Amazon.
5,Watched on PBS,"When I saw this on PBS for the first time, I was automatically drawn to it. I love music and found Celtic Woman to be very interesting as well as very pleasant to listen to. You will enjoy it no matter what your background is."
5,beautiful,"This video features beautiful singers who have absolutely spellbinding sweet and smooth voices. They sing songs both familiar and unfamiliar to the American audience. The fiddler is shockingly good, mostly because besides sawing out ultra-fast jigs, she almost never looks at her fiddle and she's usually doing an energetic dance routine too. Overall, a gorgeous show, leaving you feel refreshed and cheered."
5,Celtic Woman,I bought it for a gift and have not seen it but I'm sure it was probably OK. The person I gave it to said she loved it... best I can tell you.
5,Going to see them in concert,"This is a group of ladies that I wouldn't have normally seen. I caught it on PBS in December, and I was entranced with the beautiful harmony all these young ladies were singing in. It truly is a pleasure to see this performance. We have tickets to see them perform live at the end of the month. Definately worth the money spent on the CDs, DVDs, and tickets to the show. They bring such energy to the stage. Good luck, girls!"
5,Don't Miss Celtic Woman - A New Vourney,"I never imagined I would buy a DVD that I played (and occasionally watched) throughout quiet moments of days at home. But then came Celtic Woman - A New Journey. I more I listen to it, the more I want to enjoy it again - in a few hours of a few days. If you like beautiful music performed in a quality/professional/haunting manner, don't miss this one."
5,celtic woman. a new journey,"the best dvd i have ever watched. the celtic woman are the best, very entertaining."
2,PEALC,"It was as if thre was no microphone on the singers. When I saw this on PBS I could understand the words, but on the DVD the blending was unsatisfactory. The instruments overrode the vocalists. I was very disappointed."
2,OK but....,the recording seems like a bad copy of the original......The video is NOT sharp at all....like it was recorded off a VHS tape......the show itself is fine...somewhat disappointed..
5,Great DVD,"The staging, orchestra, costumes and singing on this DVD are all tremendous. A must have DVD"
4,Another great performance,"If you liked the original, you'll definitely like this new concert on DVD. Contains performances of the best songs from the original plus about 15 new songs. The stage/backdrop is much better - most famous Irish castle vs. indoor venue. Haley, the new singer from New Zealand, is a great compliment to the all-Irish cast of excellent voices."
3,good not great,"The setting was fantastic and most of the music was equally wonderful. The ladies just have such beautiful voices. As with all of the Celtic Woman DVDs, there is no option for closed caption. Most of the music does not need it. However, again as with all of their DVD releases, there are some songs that do - at least for those of us with hearing impairments. While I love the music, this will probably be the last one I purchase, and it is simply because they use a recording company that refuses to try and meet the needs of many people that could use the closed caption option. Sad."
4,Suspense from begining to end.,"Brooks does a good job in this last installment of the trilogy, "" The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara.."" The book never got boring as I read it. However, I feel Brooks did not spend that much time on the main antagonist the Morgawr; or his final stand with Grianne and the crew of the Jerle Shannara. Perhaps I just didn't want the novel to be over so soon. I wanted more story....that desire is the reason why I would recommend this book. To me, not wanting the book to end is great story telling!"
2,Who wrote this book?,"I have been a fan of Terry Brooks and the Shannara series from its beginning. I bought each book read and reread them then lent them to friends. Not so with this latest add-on. Did someone get paid to write 400+ pages out of a story line of perhaps 100? Snore......its unlike these characters to whine and snivel about adversity..but here they seem to bubble over with it. Seems I would read a page or two and then skip a page or two so I wouldnt have to reread all the life stories. The only other books I have ever had to do this with is Swords of Time and White Gold Wielder (you guys know what i mean..""I'm a leaper...."")"
2,Did I miss Something?,"I've read all of his work to date and am a huge fan. This is truley the first time I was disappointed with one of his series. Most of his series are stories within a story. This was one however was a continuous long droning story. The first book was disappointing. The second picked up some speed and I thought the story had been salvaged. Then the third ... well, here it is ... usually I read brooks in a couple of days. Non-stop ... can't rip it out of my hands if you tried. With this book, I had to force myself to read it and stay focused. I could be seen throwing it down more then picking it up. I didn't connect with any of the characters and found it completely predictable. Very disappointed! Hopefully it gets better ... I loved his other works. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad one every once in a while. reminds us no one is perfect and we're all human."
1,"Same story, differnet names","I am dissapointed by the Voyage of Jerle Shannara set. Its the same story (Brin and Jair) of The Wishsong. Sister is caught up by evil, brother has to save her. A Druid dies, another takes over. It seems the plot was just twisted a little bit and the names were changed.The first 10 books were ok, the rest have much to be desired."
3,"Love the pressure, hate the spray","This is a heavy metal hand shower with a vigorous spray. Only complaint is that the spray is very narrow and, at the angle it sits on the wall bracket, sprays right at your face. I have compensated for this by angling the spray head on the bracket but fear it may fall off the bracket one day and crack the shower floor. I am thinking about replacing this hand shower already but really do like the water pressure it has."
1,Return,"It was impossible to access to site to request return authorization. Also, they have a 14 day return policy. How is it possible to order a book as a Christmas gift and still return it within their restrictions. I will never buy a book from the again. Fortunatley, Amazon customer service is helping me with the return."
2,Needs Improvement,"This show is the sort of superficial pop history one expects from the History Channel, not PBS. A notable blooper was when the narrator informed us that Jackson and his wife quickly became pariahs of ""Washington Society"" after they arrived in the nation's capital in 1797 for Jackson to take his Senate seat; the glaring error being that Philadelphia, not Washington, was the capital of the United States at the time where Congress, the President and the federal government were situated."
5,marik is hot,"reviewer-elizabeth longwood fl usaanother duel i like is marik vs yugi i think it is a very instvine duel when marik uses both weeker sides in the duel when you lose life points and prat of the body is in left in the shadows by then i think marik is creepy in that prat it was sweet when marik,s good side aploised to odin i liked it better when marik was acting as nauma i wish i can write more but i have to go oh not really cause i,m really tried"
4,"Good, not incredible","I found this book a little over-hyped. There are a few very cute illustrations, and the artistic style definitely has its own flair which is not altogether unpleasant. However, it doesn't carry the emotive power page-to-page as I'd hoped. Instead it seems isolated to a few drawings in particular. Also, it's not quite beautified enough to stand as art alone without that strong emotional expression.The storyline is kind of fun, but also not quite what I hoped. I think there was more opportunity to be clever or at the very least more cute, which left me feeling like it didn't reach its full potential.All in all still an enjoyable book, just not the masterpiece that some seem to claim."
1,CAN'T REVIEW SOMETHING THAT NEVER ARRIVED.,"I ordered the Mr. Bill ""doll"" as a humorous gift for my daughter's birthday, but it never arrived."
4,HTML 4 for Dummies,"I found this item to be informative, easy to follow and well worth the price that I paid for it. The book arrived when I expected it.I would recommend this book, as a starting point, to anyone who is interested in learning HTML."
2,There are better guides out there!,"Vague and inconsistent. There is too much reliance on the CD and the toggling back and forth got old pretty fast. The book should do the teaching. The enclosed CD-ROM did not have many of the examples, especially those relating to chapters 4, 5, 9, and 10. A call to customer support promised a replacement that never arrived. I also found the attempts at humor to be distracting. More coordinated examples may help."
4,a REFERENCE for the rest of us.,"They really live up to that subtitle in this one. Chapter 6 is a reference. This is however what I needed, because I already had written some html code, but was unhappy with the code the tools were creating. Remember, YOU DO NOT NEED A BOOK TO LEARN HTML! However, a book can help you improve the your html code. If you do need a book to learn html, then your going to have much larger problems because html is the tip of the iceburg, it's what the user sees and uses to communicate with the CGI script running on the server. May all the gods help you if you need more hand holding then any HTML book would provide. You could print the reference from the web, but, that will not look as pretty on the shelf. I'm a programmer for FamilyHomeSearch.com, and use the book as a reference to make the generated html code from Microsoft Front Page 2000, more efficient."
3,Not necessary,"If you have a computer, and you want to learn HTML, you could save the money and go to sites like webmonkey that will teach you the same things, and more, for free. It was a good place to start, and it was useful, but I can use web references quicker, easier, and cheaper."
2,This book is not worth buying for the amount it costs,To read this book you have to skip through the pages. They don't give good explanations. They don't tell you good information and explain anything. You should get HTML Goodies instead.
2,Good basic mat if you have dry hands and feet,"I initially purchased this mat when first starting yoga (Iyengar) 3 years ago--however, I've found that even with multiple washings, it is just not sticky enough for me for many poses. I must have sweatier feet and hands than others who have used this mat! I am waiting to receive Harmony's rubber mat--this one is used in the yoga studio I go to and seems quite sticky."
5,The stickiest yoga mat,"This mat did take 3 or 4 uses to break in and as with all mats there is some slipping when you're dripping sweat, however, I still find this mat to be the stickiest that I have come across. I even tried the LuLuLemon mat and I like this one better."
2,inferior in all ways to other brands,"I have used stevia in multiple forms since the early 1990's and never knew it could taste so bad! If you have never had stevia do not assume this is how it tastes. Try Stevita or sweetleaf. This is inferior to those brands in all ways - taste, mixability, amount needed to get the same sweetness. Not worth the price difference."
3,On the Fence,"I purchased this Stevia because I wanted to eliminate the chemical artificial sweeteners in my diet. I really wanted to like this product and bough both the packets and the can. Yes, the product does sweeten whatever you put it in.... but it has an ""interesting"" taste. It is not a bad taste, but I have yet to use it again after the initial trial. If you are looking for a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar, this is not it... if you are looking for an alternative sweetener that is healthier, give it a shot!"
3,Well I guess that's it,"With Ice-T making bad movies and silly TV shows, his singing days are over. He probably did this to get out of his contract and be fully available to star in the 'Facts of Life' Reunion tour. I hear he's going to play Mrs. Garret's long lost pimp."
4,The O.G. collection.,"It's almost as dope as 16 tracks of ""Ice-T"" could be. Everything here is good, and I only miss a few songs. It would be nice to have ""Drama"" on here, as well as ""Ziplock"", but thank God it has ""Colors"", from the movie of the same name. That is truly one of the very first ""gangsta"" raps. He could have thrown on a track from ""Body Count"", lord knows ""Cop Killer"" would have sold some more copies of this, but I can see why he didn't. Overall this is a great collection from the pimp himself, and if you don't get it, you better have ""O.G. Original Gangster""."
5,LIFE CHANGING,"I used to be one of those women who thought this was gross, but honestly, it is not as long as you are comfortable with your body. By the end of my period, the bleach in tampons made me irritated and dry and unbleached tampons are too expensive. This feels great and YOU WILL NEVER LEAK. No more period underwear! Not to mention its so much better for the environment! I feel great about the trash I am not generating."
2,Evil vagina stretcher,"I really like the concept of the diva cup. But it literally felt like a vagina stretcher. Also, it leaks. They say that you need practice to get it right but I can only stand to stain so many pairs of my underwear. If you are someone who doesn't care about having to clean out the blood from the cup or about having stain-free underwear, then get this. But I can't do it. Sorry Mother Earth!!"
3,DivaCup Review,"The concept is great. The actual application of it is messy. Eventually you get a feel for the product and it becomes easier to insert and take out. The cup does not hold all my flow so I normally have to wear a pad in conjunction with the Diva cup. I would have to empty the cup every couple of hours if I were to go without the pad. The nice thing about the cup is you can exercise and use the restroom without worrying about moving a string from a tampon out of the way or that your exercise movement might make the pad leak. All in all I mostly use the Diva cup but I still use pads and tampons on occasion. However, I use them a lot less so it does save me money in the long run."
4,Changed my life,I was researching how to handle traveling on you're period around thanksgiving and found this as my solution.I would suggest that you still use a pad or a liner when you first start using it. Improper insertion will cause leakage.I did a dry test with this product before my period to see if I can insert it and take it out with ease. At first it was a hassle. I almost panicked when I couldn't get it out! However with a little practice I got the use of this down to a science.Now I can work my 10 hour shifts without worrying about odor or leakage. This product is so comfortable that I sometimes forget that I'm on my period.Pros:* Comfortable* No longer have to worry about buying pads* It pays for itself in about 2 months of useCons:* Can be frustrating to use at first
2,Ouch!,"I love the concept of this product and tried for more than a year's worth of cycles to make it work, but the Diva Cup often leaves me feeling raw after use.I looked up different tips and hints, making sure that I was using it properly and definitely was. I ordered the correct size, too.The reviews indicate that it works better for the majority of women who've reviewed it, so good on them, but I'll be switching to reusable panty liners."
3,from the male POV,"I bought it for my g/f. She seems to like it and thinks the benefits slightly outweigh the hassle of washing it. I think they freaking rock! WAY cleaner and more compact than other solutions allowing for increased intimacy during menstruation, less waste, fresher smelling bathrooms, no stained panties, smaller overnight bags: fewer things for either of us to worry about in general. Also, it should pay for itself in about 6 months (100% ROI in the first year. Can't beat that during a recession!). Added bonus: I'll never have to pick up tampons at the store for her again xDSeriously, I have no idea why people even use pads or tampons. They suck. As a guy I just didn't know any better because I'd never really thought about it but cups rock (there are also disposable cups in most stores, FYI, but they are kinda flimsy and more prone to leakage and you have to keep buying lots of them). Guys: get one for your g/f. You'll both be glad."
2,Not for me :-/,"I ordered the pre-childbirth model of the Diva Cup. I can't insert it without pinching (painful!), and even when it is fully inserted I still have to wear a panty liner because it leaks around the edges, can't form a good seal. I guess I am one of the people it just doesn't fit well. Love the idea, but just doesn't fit."
5,Awesome product!,"I could NEVER get the hang of tampons and I couldn't stand how they felt. Pads are a mess and are getting expensive! I just started wearing the Diva Cup and I love it! I first made the mistake of buying the #2 size after I was told on their main website if you're 29 and still have never giving birth, to buy the 2. Well...let me tell you, I felt like I was trying to jam a coffee cup up my hoo-hoo! And I won't tell you how it felt to remove it! Ouch! I really wanted to like this product, so I bought the #1 size. It was a world of difference! It's easier going in and bearable coming out. It really doesn't leak, just a bit of spotting after you remove and reinsert it. I would just like to add that, I've even read reviews of women who have given birth to children and still use the size 1. If you have given birth to one child and you're a smaller frame, don't let them talk you into buying the 2 size and than discover it's too big! Buy the 1 first!"
3,mixed feelings,"Diva cup sounds like a great idea. While it's in you don't have to think about it for quite a few hours, i didn't feel it, it didn't leak, and there was no nasty tampon to dispose of. But removing that thing was like giving birth! OMG if you try this thing give yourself plenty of time to remove it!"
4,no more tampons,"The diva cup rocks. I've used it for six months. I had some cramping the first day I inserted it, and then never again. I haven't had problems with leakage at all. For me, it's so much more comfortable than the tampons. The cup stays put when I have to use the toilet, when I cough, when I run, lift weights, etc. It misses 5 stars because it's a drag with public restrooms. I would rather wash it with soap and water each time I remove it, and that's difficult to maneuver in public toilets."
2,"Great idea, but lacking in execution...","In theory this product is amazing. A reusable cup that can last 12 hours, won't give you TSS, and cuts back on the $$ spent on tampons/pads...count me in! However, I have experienced some problems using this product. First off, insertion is fairly easy enough but I can never get the cup to open up completely. I've just been letting it go and eventually it pops open on its own, but I'm waiting for the day that doesn't happen and I end up leaking blood everywhere. And speaking of that, removing this thing is a joke. I can't imagine trying to remove the cup anywhere other than the privacy of your own home. Took me five minutes of digging around to pull the cup down far enough to break the seal and remove it. By the time it's all over, my bathroom looks like a crime scene and my vagina hurts.Is it worth it? Not for me, but I still love the idea of it. I would recommend that all ladies should try it at least once, as it seems to work great for some. You never know!"
5,Better than I could have imagined,"I've used commercial tampons, natural tampons, pads, and disposable menstrual cups before and this absolutely is the best, easiest, and most effective. Without a doubt.It is much easier to insert and remove than I thought, because that was a concern of mine at first. You feel it in you even less than tampons. Change it once every twelve hours + it's virtually impossible to fill the cup up enough to warrant changing more often = it's almost difficult to remember that you're even on your period! I am not kidding at all! It's small, discreet, easy to use, easy to clean, comfortable, eco-friendly.. I can't say enough good stuff about this. It even feels much less invasive than tampons. I have yet to have it shift a single inch or leak a single drop.The gross part of me really wants to start gifting these to my friends!!"
3,Femme cup,"Good product Good product wou.d buy againfast shipping,so good for our earth and ourselves.love this product everyone should have one of these,think of the savings."
5,So happy I made the switch,"I can't say enough good things about the diva cup. Yes, it might take a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but I'm totally sold and never going back to tampons. The benefits are multi-fold; it's better for the environment, better for the ph balance of your vagina, cheaper than tampons over time, you don't have to worry about your tampon supply, the list goes on... I get terrible cramps, but my period is definitely much easier on the diva cup. Once I get past the bad day 1 cramps, I sometimes even forget I'm on my period as I don't have to change the diva cup more than twice a day. It's a revelation! Get on it ladies!!!"
5,Not As Scary as It Looks!,"This thing is epic! I was a bit apprehensive about shoving this thing into my tender bits, but it's actually really easy to put in and take out. It makes that time of the month so much less annoying!"
5,LOVE,"I wish I had one of these when I was a teen... How different that time of the month is now! No more worrying about changing tampons, pads, panty liners, nothing. Getting the hang of removing it was a little... odd. Now it takes seconds. I will only use this now. Love it."
1,Melted,"The very first time I used this mat (450 degrees), the food melted into the mat.It is supposed to be good to 480 degrees.A waste of money and a piece of junk that went directly into the garbage.Can you rate something with zero stars?"
5,Silpat,"This is a great product for preventing the oh-so-unwanted browning on the bottoms of cookies, etc. I still use parchment paper, but with the Silpat you won't go to your baking supplies one day and find you had run out (parchment). So that's a plus!"
1,Not for the 4 to 8 year old category,"I purchased this book for my son. After reading the customer reviews, I thought it was a pretty safe purchase. But after receiving it, we quickly found that the story was to easy to figure out and could not keep my son focused. It is a simple story meant to be read to two year olds. I also found the animation sloppy. Others may find it entertaining, it is all a matter of personal tastes. But I do not feel this book belongs in the catagory of 4 to 8 year olds. It is to short and not challenging enough for this age group."
5,Wonderful pan!,I purchased this just before Christmas and made two batches of shortbread following the recipe on the wrapper. Excellent! I used spray canola oil to grease the pan and sprinkled white edible glitter on the shortbread after cooking to make them a little more festive. Everyone loved the cookies-would definitely recommend this pan to all bakers!
3,Dissapointed with the shortbread pan,"I was thrilled to recieve this pan and could not wait to try it. I bake professionally and often so I followed directions carefully . Unfortunately although the shortbread baked to an even and golden color , the indentations were faint at best ! I was so dissapointed . I wanted to use this pan for cakes and brownies too ( Short as they may be ! ) and use a glaze to show off the beautiful etchings , but now I guess that will simply not be possible."
3,Screwpull by Le Creuset,"We love our simple Screwpulls (friends have broken several over the years, because they did not ask how to work it, so we keep buying new ones). But the most recent one does not say Screwpull on the side - it says ""Le Creuset."" And in opening one kind of bottle (it happens to be the tall Toasted Head Chardonnay bottle), the hub on the side which holds the opener against the bottle rim is slightly larger, and will not permit the cork to come out, without rocking the opener sideways. It works fine on all the other wine bottles I have tried. My old one says ""Screwpull"" with the little circled R after, and it works perfectly. I wonder if this is this a newly-engineered style? I like the old one better."
2,Aqua Aerobics Shoe,"This shoe did not hold up as expecte4d. Within 2 days the shoe started to discolor ever after proper care. After 1 month of use the ""rubberized"" insole started to disintegrate and the velcro tie straps ripped (also from disintegrations) within 2 months."
2,Gilligan's or Fantasy Island,"""Paradise"" is actually the coast of Australia, where this 1989 made-for-TV adventure was filmed. Raquel Welch stars as a rich, spoiled socialite who is shipwrecked on a desert island. Her only companion is boozy, unkempt Aussie Jack Thompson. Before the film has a chance to turn into Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away (or even Gilligan's Island), Welch and Thompson are up to their necks in intrigue. Better to see ""Six Days and Seven Nights"", Same plot - better story. Better to see ""Fathom"", different Raquel - better bathing suit."
5,Very useful,"This is the best way to teach and learn - fun and play, and this is what Standard Deviants are doing. Shakepseare is closer and frendlier thanks to this DVD. I recommend it withiut hesitation."
4,Authentic Language & Feel For A Post-War America,"While this collection of short stories is, at best, uneven there is no denying Mr. Goran's mastery of language and setting. These gifts alone give the stories a texture that make the collection a worthwile read.All the stories revolve around the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Irish Club, in postwar Pittsburgh. There is an attractive, understated tribal neighborliness to all the stories that not only feels real but gives flesh to such nonfiction think books as Ray Suarez's ""What We Lost"".The collection as a whole, could have been better edited and in some of the stories, Goran is not up to the task he sets himself, but the quiet tension in these stories has appeal."
3,Evan saved it!,alright this movie sucked. but i gave it three stars cause Evan Peters is so fricken sexy in it. the plot was horrible ther acting was bad and the fat chick was so annoying!!!! i am 14 and i hate this damn movie! but russell is so hot!!!!!!!
3,"Lost Connection very often, few times a day","This NetGear RangeMax Wireless Router gave me a lot of trouble. It lost connections very often and the tech support is not easy! The connection is not stable. Today I reinstalled (or updated the same version--this took me a whole day to figure out to do so).It works now, but just died twice!"
3,It's just okay,"We've had our big screen 20 months and already the tv won't turn on. Called the warranty number and the tech said it sounds like the lamp has burned out. ALREADY!!!! He also proceded to tell me that about every 2 yrs. we can expect to replace it. I couldn't believe my ears. Why would anyone in their right mind purchase a tv knowing that at $200 per lamp you'd be doing this regularly? I wish hubby would have done his homework before surprising me with this set. His tv of 10 yrs is still running strong with no problems. Ironically it's also a Mitsubishi but not this model. People, please shop around and don't be misled by the sales staff."
5,This Hits Home!,"Having once been a client of Sandy Jost's, I have never forgotten the power of her voice and the great confidence it imparted in the midst of crisis. Her voice is now a powerful and effective tool for healing on the CD which accompanies this book. The book itself is a concise guide to developing healing images. I was captured by Sandy's keen perception in understanding how my oh-so-slippery negative thoughts would seek to sabotage the healing ones. Although I am now strong and vital, this book will never leave my bedside table."
2,Not much of a pulse,Pretty much a throwaway ep in a questionable discography. The band has a knack for making distorted repetition work in their favor and includes a few noticeable passages amidst the vacant excess but ultimately sounds more of artsy noise collage then inspired monotony.
1,Be very Careful,"I was interested in this book and instead of buying the paperback version this time I decided to go for the Kindle edition. In return I got a single page with the poem "" I Am"" on it .!!!Be very carefull I had assumed that Amazon were above this type of sleight of hand"
5,A separate entity,"While it seems the previous reviewers look at 1-Speed Bike as a boiled down drum n bass version of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, I think this album should be considered more honestly as its own unique sound with its own intentions. ""Droopy Butt Begone!"" has an edge without the saturation and melodrama of GY!BE. The beats are strong and creative, and give a sense of environment and connection to life. I get the impression of Aidan laying down tracks like Bjork's character in ""Dancer in the Dark"", evolving out of a moment. Great stuff. I highly recommend it for driving."
1,Junk,"My husband bought this for me for our anniversary, and it broke the same day. It's beautiful, but the clasp snapped off after I had been wearing it for only a couple hours. Very disappointing."
4,Fine Classic Travel Bag,"Got this for my husband for a conference trip. He loved the quality of the leather, craftsmanship and the medical bag style. The main section is roomy, and the zip bottom compartment is a plus although it is only about two inches high. This is a item that will last, getting better as it ages."
2,Good airplane read,"Although I didn't actually read this book on a plane that's the only place I can think of where reading this book wouldn't be a complete waste of time. The plot was incredibly trite, contrived, and entirely too predictable, as was the love story. It was really just your typical boy meets girl who he can't have story. It even had the obligatory literary reference to Romeo and Juliet. The premise of the bin was interesting, but the author didn't delve into the technology enough. Despite all of this it was a quick, easy, kind of fun read. Perfect plane fodder."
3,"Good instruction, but there is no need for buying a series","The instruction of the director is good. However, there is no obvious different between three tapes. The beginner DVD and advance DVD are very similar.Actually I think it waste money too buy a series."
2,disappointing compared to the Finder's Stone trilogy,"I expected a lot from this book. I enjoyed the Finder's Stone trilogy greatly (*especially* _The Wyvern's Spur_), and was looking forward to seeing the characters again.Instead, I found a hackneyed plot and flattened characters. Alias and friends seemed to move like puppets, and the villain was never adequately fleshed out.Avoid this one and go back to the Finder's Stone trilogy."
4,"Westgate, a nice little town to visit, but . . .","Alias returns to her ""hometown"" of Westgate on a trivial matter for the Harpers and gets sucked into a battle with the Nightmasks and their leader the Faceless. The Nightmasks are ruthless thieves who really run the city. They have their grubby hands in every pocket and a knife at every back. Alias is hired to break their ring and bring in the Faceless.This is a good tale which is nicely paced and leaves a few things open for future novels. The characters are solid (but then, most of them have been fleshed out looong ago) and interesting. A good book if you haven't read any of their previous novels, a great one if you have."
5,The BEST Scorsese box set on DVD!,"This is a brilliant collection of Scorsese's films, an even better collection than MGM's Scorsese Box Set! It gives us a Special Edition of ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese's first film (finally on DVD) ""Who's That Knocking At My Door?"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", a Special Edition of ""Mean Streets"" and (another finally on DVD) ""After Hours"".The gems of this collection are Mean Streets, After Hours, and Goodfellas. These three films are considered to be among Scrosese's best! Pick this up today if you're a Scorsese fan, or a film buff, or if you're trying to get into Scorsese's work. Recommended."
4,How about a special edition of Taxi Driver with Commentary?,"Like the idea of a box set, and am happy Scorsese is releasing Goodfellas with commentary - but we need a new edition of Taxi Driver with commentary. Also, despite what others have said, Casino has grown on me over the years and is certainly no clone of Goodfellas. The film is worth revisiting. I have a VHS version, so I don't know if the current DVD of Casino contains commentary, but if not, it should be reissued with one. Scorsese, as everyone knows, is a terrific scholar of film history, so I'm sure he understands the importance of leaving behind as full an account of his own work as he can. His future fans will be as grateful as his current ones."
5,SO glad I switched!,"After two kids (one Vag., one csect) I couldn't use tampons any more. I'd sneeze and it would practically shoot across the room. I tried the super plus tampons but I think it is more of a loss of muscle tone thing, not a too roomy thing. I've tried Instead cups before but they are pretty flimsy and you have to keep buying them as they are one time use. I got the Diva Cup size 2 and it fits fine. Keep the directions handy the first few times you insert. For me, aiming for the tailbone was clutch (part of the instructions). The first couple days of my period I usually have to empty (or ""dump my cup"" as I tell my husband) 2-3 times during the day. By day three I usually just empty it twice, morning and evening. I've never had it leak day or night, and I was paranoid and wore a panty liner. If I'm at home I'll rinse it out before reinserting (I can reach the sink from the toilet). If I'm out and about I just wipe it out with TP. Saves money, saves the environment, sneeze safe."
3,"Great idea, but leak - TMI","I got one of these last year and have used it the entire 12 months. It's a great idea. At first I thought it would be a total mess and didn't see how it could be more sanitary than tampons seeing that your getting your hands definitely dirty, but since using it I understand how sanitary it is to not have a bunch of bloody sticks in the trash.I don't feel like I've saved much money since I have to use a pad with it. It's comfortable, but tends to lead depending on the angle I'm sitting or laying.These are great if you're going to be staying home or know the places you'll be going have a sink right next to the toilet. On the road they're somewhat frustrating and I don't feel as clean when I'm wiping it out with tissue and not able to fully rinse it.Great idea, but somewhat difficult to master and not as clean as they claim."
1,GROSS,"In a perfect world this product would work great for everyone. I'm squeamish but even if I wasn't this is still gross. No one wants to handle their own blood. I'm sticking to tampons, I don't care if they're not as safe. I'd much rather pull it out and dispose of it instead of having to rinse out a cup."
5,diva cup rocks!,"I love this product! I took the diva cup traveling for my first use. I was a little worried about switching to something new, but it turned out to be the perfect travel companion. It took up very little space, and was extremely easy to use and comfortable. I love that it is environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and more comfortable than any other feminine hygiene product. I have been recommending this to all of my friends. I am 29 years old with no children. I purchased the size 2 model since I'm almost 30. No problems :)"
4,More convenient than tampons.,"I have heard of these things before and was awfully squeamish about the idea. I thought only raving-mad hippies would use such a gross product, but a friend of mine wore me down and convinced me to try it. I've only used it once, and it has been absolutely fabulous. I've already almost paid for it by not having to buy tampons, and it is much more comfortable than tampons. I have had ZERO leaks with it, and that includes when running on the treadmill, sleeping at night, etc. I love that I only have to check it a few times a day, versus changing tampons out almost every hour. We spend a lot of time at the lake, and I think I'm really going to love it this summer when I don't have to worry about anything when getting in and out of the water all day. I am under 30, but have two kids, and the Model 2 seems to do the job."
2,Not so impressed,"I tried this product because I was sick of leaking tampons and having to change them every hour or so at my heaviest. I had no problems inserting the Diva cup properly. It was less comfortable to me than a tampon just because I could feel it. It did help some what when I cut the bottom tip all the way off.I was disappointed that I still leaked a little and found the process of removal and washing to be quite disgusting. It would not work at all in a public restroom. I purchased this in hopes that I would be able to go more than 6 hours between washings but that was not possible. So to date, I have not used it again since. I may try it again during swim season because I hate those long strings."
5,fabulous product!,"Anyone thinking about making the switch from tampons or pads to this product...don't think twice. I feel like a totally different woman! My cramps are significantly decreased and I barely think about my period when I have it. It takes some getting used to inserting and taking out the DivaCup, but it wasn't a hard learning curve for me. I will say, after reading some comments, I tried inserting the cup after soaking in some boiling water...and it did wonders to help with the very mild lower back pain and cramps. I slept like a baby that night. I have been raving to all my friends, and now I had to come online to let everyone know, TRY THIS PRODUCT, you will wonder why you ever used tampons and the like, and you are doing something nice for the environment (and your bathroom trash)."
4,Still learning,"I've only used the diva cup for two cycles, but am very happy with its performance. I'm still fine-tuning my usage, but the cup has been easy to insert, remove, clean and use in public. I am happy to not have to worry about buying disposable products every month and worrying if I have enough. I would recommend the Diva Cup to friends."
1,Horrible Customer Service (Diva Cup),"My Diva Cup leaks. I ordered this product through Amazon. I have one child but I am 22 years old, so I ordered the Diva Cup size 2 (which is exactly what they recommend). It leaks every time I wear it. It seems like it is too big. I contacted Diva Cup and they said ""Due to the nature of the product, we do not accept exchange or refund."" What? So, you have to depend on their recommendation for the size, and even if you follow the directions COMPLETELY (They sent me the long version of the directions and that was exactly what I was doing), they will not exchange. I contacted Diva Cup again, and they said that I should try doing Kegel's because childbirth probably loosened my muscles! Thankfully, Amazon's AMAZING customer service helped me out. Moon Cup has a thirty day guarantee and my friend has had no problem with leaking. I think I will try that one next."
2,Hard to use!!!,Just received this product and I am not very happy with it. It is very difficult to use. If you can place it in the correct way it would probably work but good luck with that!!!
2,watch out for urinary tract infections,"I switched from the Instead Softcup to the diva cup. It is less messy and worked fine, but after using it for three months, I got a urinary tract infection within 10 hours of inserting it. I hadn't had a UTI in almost 20 years. I was careful in washing it and my hands with anti-bac soap, but I will never use a diva cup again. UTI's are just too painful. If you are susceptible to UTI's, I would suggest using a product that is not reused."
4,emotional synthpop,"I first heard of them via the song, ""The Stuff of Magick"" on the Shadow Dancing compilation.I was gladly suprised when I bought the cd that most of the other songs stood up just as well to this song.I like the ballad track ""Fall"" the most which is by far the most emotional track on the cd.This CD is extremely polished and well performed in regards to the soothing vocals and emotional lyrics. This is NOT one of those synthpop groups that has great music but horrible vocals i.e. some German guy trying to carry a tune. Great stuff and highly recomended."
1,Not that great.,"Not that great. A far better read is ""Sun, Sin And Suburbia: An Essential History Of Modern Las Vegas"" by Geoff Schumacher."
1,Repackaged,"I purchased a set of these several months ago and just got around to using them. They don't come in the Remington package that's shown on the Amazon site. They are repackaged in a small cheap cardbord box. As far as performance goes, they suck. Don't waste your money."
4,parts,My Titanium MS2 280 is working great but the little rubber piece on the on/off button is defective and won't stay on the razor. I would like a new rubber piece if someone can tell me how to obtain it.[...]
1,no instructions a problem,"As with a couple other customers, I also was frustrated and wasted valuable time trying to find instructions about how to replace the screens in the quickest possible way without damaging. It is unbelievable that the company does not provide basic instructions. Not only is the product mediocre overall, but the service is horrendous; congratulations, Remington, you manage to alienate AND anger your customers!"
1,Very Misleading!,These bars are advertised as OSKRI COCONUT WITH ALMOND when they are in fact coconut with almond flavoring which is very different than WITH ALMONDS! This is false advertising and for someone who hates almond flavoring it was a big disappointment to find I was misled and I feel ripped off! Yuck! These things taste like they have perfume in them!!!!!!!!!!
3,it is what it is: coconut,"I really like Oskri and coconut, so I bought these bars. Not what I was expecting. It is what it is: a coconut bar. Basically shredded coconut stuck together with syrup. No almond taste, barely any almonds in the bars. Good taste, but kinda boring. Also not healthy, all saturated fat, so this is kinda a dessert thing. Also if you don't like sugary things, this is kinda on the border for me."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this product. I love natural coconut and use coconut products extensively so I thought given the other reviews that I would enjoy this product.Sooo wrong. I don't mind the oiliness....it's coconut oil which is really good for us, but the taste is yucky. It's very macaroon-y in taste which to me is excessively sweet and cloying. I love coconut....raw, shredded unsweetened coconut and this product does not have that flavor.The taste is overly sweet and overly processed to me. Tried one and gave the rest of the box to the thrift store."
4,A very interesting watch,"I saw this yesterday on cable and really liked it - Great plot, with some surprises along the way. Does Jerry O'Connell remind anyone else of a young Patrick Swayze? He's actually an excellent actor. And Sam Elliot, well what can you say about him?I highly recommend this movie."
5,Demystifies Raw Feeding,"I loved the authors approach to raw feeding. She is realistic and provides a great guideline to start raw feeding. In the end, it's not the rocket science most of us make it out to be and my my highly allergic french bulldogs are thriving and hopping, skipping, and jumping all the way to their bowls every night!"
5,Wonderful Info on Raw feeding!,I started my English bull dog on Raw feeding and loved this book for the info on how to and quantities. The benefits are endless! Love this how to book!
3,DVD Quality ?,"For those who wish to buy this dvd-box ,don't expect superior picture and sound quality because it looks like they have been copied from the VHS-tapes.You can clearly see the overal vagueness and in the darker scenes where dvd's usually shine brighter than tapes ,you've got no improvement at all.Also , u have to turn the sound up quite a bit to understand anything that is said and even then it's not great.The only plus points to buying the dvd are the navigation menu ,less space than the tapes and no tape wear ,no rewinds."
4,Justice makes nations great,"The best thing I like about this product is the honesty and justice that has been done by certain Europeans to this topic after a 1000 yrs of confusion in the west regarding the Crusades. If the west continues to be just and unbiased in other spheres of political, business and social life as it has been in the case of this documentary, then God willing, the west will continue to be great."
2,Skip this one if you are looking for a good balance.,"The Introduction says it all: ""We make no pretensions of extending the bounds of scholarship"": they certainly don't; the supporting documentation appears on the weak side. ""For those who want to read more there is plenty"": correct! Skip this one if you are looking for a serious, well-supported, well-balanced and unbiased treatment of the subject. The style is definitely too journalistic; some of the opinions expressed by the authors (e.g. on the Church, on the French, on the aristocracy) are patronising and give the appearance of having been poorly researched. Lastly, towards the end the events and names reported tend to get increasingly confusing."
5,Doing Justice to the Myth,"What I want with each retelling, whether it be a nursery rhyme or one of my grandfather's war stories, is something fresh and different. I love, of course, rereading my favorite books and poems, but with a tale like that of Orpheus and Eurydice, I'm simply not looking for the same story. I want a new perspective, not only a retelling, but a reshaping of the myth. Orr puts his own spirit into what many of you may know of as the tragic lives of the two lovers. He writes, however, from a place unlike most before him. With the same joy as seeing a film remade with exceptional talent, I read Orr's work with excitement and pleasure. It's not the same story. It's much more."
4,packs a lot of protein,"As a post-gastric bypass patient, I'm always looking for ways to incorporate protein sources into palatable meals. Used this recently with some pad thai and it was a flavorful addition."
3,"great set, great price, crappy box!","these films are good quality, but yeah, everyone else was right, the very first time i opened it the whole thing came apart in my hands!"
2,Too much info can be a bad thing!!,"Thought this book would give me more specific answers which I could retrieve quickly like the book ""Why men marry Bitches"" but I found this book provided more questions than answers. It was also all a bit too dry. A waste of money for me!!"
2,Teach yourself Oracle SQL in 24 Hours,"It is not important how much you pay for a book,It is important on what you spend your precious time.This Book Lies! It lies in its title.Title must be change to:""Learn Oracle SQL in 24 Hours""More than 90% of samples are for oracle.Author only mentions that this SQL can be done in other implementations!!!Bottom Line: DO NOT BUY THIS if you are trying to learn MS SQLFor sql server."
1,Interesting Theories,"This author talks about human behavior as though he is conducting a study with white, lab rats, and babbles on like a kid who needs to make his essay 2,500 words long for a grade. For instance, in the chapter titled ""Approaching Men"", Viddler takes up 11 grueling pages to explain that in order to attract an emotionally available man, all that a woman has to do is to stand in a man's proximity, stare, look away, stare again, and run her fingers through her hair. He didn't need to spend 11 pages to explain this. In addition, Viddler tries to point out that no matter what you look like, you can still get that certain ""someone"" to become attracted to you and to fall passionately in love with you forever. This book could have been scaled way, way down, and it could have been explained in plain english, instead of like a college thesis."
2,"God, this book is awful... but I do love Ted.","So, my husband picked this up for me when he happened upon Ted Allen signing them at our local cookware store. Very sweet, but I wish the book had matched the intention. I love Ted Allen, but I can't imagine he is happy with this book. For a beginner, I suppose it would be helpful (but then any cookbook would), but for any vaguely experienced home chef, it offers nothing original nor creative, which is something Ted prides himself on. Production value aside (enough people have commented on the horrible photography), there's just nothing new here."
2,honorable mention,"I love Ted Allen, but this cookbook was really nothing special, like a previous reviewer said before me I would have liked more pictures of the food, and less of Ted Allen in cheesy poses."
5,"Fast and easy food that's delicious--and that looks cool, too","I'm kinda new at cooking, and I don't have a lot of time to do it, so I really appreciate cookbooks with recipes that aren't too difficult. At the same time, especially when I'm having friends (or dates!) to dinner, I want to serve food that's interesting and real--the microwave is fine, but not for company! I've tried the prime rib, one of the pizzas, the salmon with tomato vinaigrette, and the creme brulee so far, and everything has come out AMAZING!"
1,No a representative sample,"Like others have said, this sample examination is not representative of the actual exam. It is far too difficult. I took this sample exam two weeks prior to the real test when I was finished reviewing every topic. I think my score was something like 42 of 80 correct and I was very short on time during the morning section. I don't have the results yet for the real exam, but I would be surprised if I didn't get 60+ questions correct (I knew how to solve all but a few) and I had plenty of time to go back and check answers.The main review book by the same author is a good book (I would highly recommend that), but don't get this sample exam. The only thing it was good for was completely scaring me two weeks prior to the real exam."
4,Works well,"This product was used on an office that was adding several new computers to areas that were not originally designed to have computers. Instead of running wires all over the place we decided to go wireless. These worked very well and were a great alternative solution. They are USB and a little bulky so you have to be careful with plugging in to many other things around it, or if you have it plugged in the front of the desktop you have to be careful not to bump it but besides that its very convenient."
5,Understanding which speeches make folks listen,"Renee GrantWilliams' Voice Power tells how to apply positive vocal techniques to both business and personal situations. From using silence as an exclamation and delivering persuasive sales pitches to understanding which speeches make folks listen, this is packed with insights."
3,Okay Book But Not For Repeat Viewing,"First of all, I love the South, and love plantation homes. The photographs in this book are very good. I personally didn't enjoy the photos of the rundown and derelict plantations. I bought this book because I thought it contained BEAUTIFUL pictures of the finest homes. And most of them are very nice, BUT...First of all, this is a pricey book.I once had a slim volume offerred by the Travel bureau that was better than this book. If all you want is to have a pretty coffee table book, it's fine. I personally would have preferred they leave out the aerial photos high above the homes...and the photos of derelict, rundown plantations and included more interior shots or different angles of the really beautiful plantations. I found that I looked through it once, but will probably rarely look through it again. Though it is well done for what it is, when reading the reviews before purchasing, I had a different impression of what this book is."
3,OK Wood Vise,"Basic tool. It does need a quick release and set. It gets tiresome turning the handle. But, you get what you pay for and it is not expensive."
5,Rapid Slide Adjustable Wrench,"I found this tool to be a great product, easily found while shopping Amazon, purchased without difficulty, and delivered in a timely manner. I'm quite happy with this product. Thanks"
3,Unusual Interpretation,"This book, while well meaning, makes some unusual (if not VERY unusual) interpretations of biblical scripture. If you want the ""Mystic"" view of Christianity, read this book. Either the author truly believes what he is saying because he has not studied scripture enough to truly understand it (or to just basically understand it), or he doesn't mind twisting biblical teachings to fit his views. Either way, borrow this one from the library. There are just too many unusual interpretations for me to take this book seriously."
3,AVERAGE,Well the reason for three Stars......SavageVS.Hogan and DemolitionVS.Powers of Pain. The undercard was to long and had no real definition. Warrior losing the belt was to set up a summerslam match later that year. Hogan and Savage put on a good show for that time. This ranks up with Wrestlmania 15. An Average show. As they sat Average is good!
5,Excellent Purchase,This video was exactly as described by the seller. It was priced well and I received it in record time. Thanks!
3,very good from a historical stand point,I was given this book twenty years ago when I became a police officer. This book then was the book for revolver gun fighting. It recieved five stars then. It is well worth the read and I am sorry that I loaned it out to another officer. Because now it is out of print. For a trip through the training of a pistol fighter of the past this is an excelent book.
5,Retired preschool teacher,This is a timeless classic enjoyed again and again. Illustrations are great and the story capivates young & old audiences alike.
1,Disappointed it doesn't come with a BOOK,"This audio book has no read along for kids, a big disappointment!"
5,Fun to read Along,"We have kids that struggle in reading, so this read along was a lot of fun! We would recommend it."
4,"A valuable, thought provoking, and very dense contribution.","Schulman's book is adds a valuable new take on the interpretion of quantum mechanics, and his approach is gratifyingly detailed. This book presents those details in full, in an entertaining and congenial style. Though there is a lot to be gained from this book, it is technically overwhelming in some places. For those undertaking a rigorous investigation of the possible solutions to the measurement problem, this is worth a carefull look. This is not, however, a book for the casual reader."
5,Swedish Symphonic Fare,"For one who may only be familiar with Alfven's Swedish Rhapsody No. 1 (the one work by which he is most commonly known), this CD is an excellent way of expanding that familiarity, for in addition to containing the rhapsody, it also contains his second symphony, the major work on the CD. The symphony clearly reveals that Hugo Alfven was by no means a one-work composer, and that his other compositions will certainly reward the listener."
2,Not worth the hype,"I was excited to purchase this item after reading the good reviews. I have burned myself more times than I can count with an old fashioned oven mitt, after they have gotten damp when a lot of baking is being done. I baked cookies today at 350 degrees, put on my new Lekue Silicone Super Flexible Oven mitt and took out the first batch. Before I could finish taking off the 12 chocolate chip cookies of the sheet my hand was really warm. For supposedly being heat resistance to 575 degrees, 350 should have been a breeze. Needless to say I am disappointed. I will continue to use them, since I do a lot of baking and my regular oven mitts get wet after I rinse off the sheets, but would not recommend them to friends. I also purchased a silicone oven mitt from my local grocery store (HEB, in Texas), it was their store brand, for my daughter. I tried her mitt and although being rated to only 450 degrees worked much better than the more expensive name brand."
4,Best available performance of No. 6,"Martinu's symphonies suffer from the fact that the first five are very good, but the sixth--the ""Fantasies Symphoniques""--is a masterpiece. Seemingly rhapsodic but with the iron logic of a compelling dream, it's a work unlike any other in the repertoire. Jarvi's performance is the first on CD to stand comparison with the premiere recording, by Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony, who commissioned the piece in 1956. Belohlavek's Chandos disk is beautifully played, but lacks the intensity this piece needs to convey its hallucinatory lucidity. Jarvi's performance of the Fifth is fine as well, but it's the Sixth that lingers in the mind."
4,wow---i'm impressed,she never takes the easy route. there are so many surprises that make me stop and say whooa--both in the music and lyrics. definitely and album to buy.
4,Vital Touch,This book is really worth the time and thought provoking. It has helped me a lot in my work as a nurse
5,Pleased and unhappy,"I am very pleased that I have found a source for this product(CP Brisling Sardines). The quality is as I remember, very good. The unhappiness waswith the condition of the cans, four(4) of the twelve(12) were damaged and unusable. The young lady at the post office where I received the package turned up her nose at the smell of the box. I would reorder this item if it could be delivered in an undamaged condition. Brisling Sardines in Olive Oil, 2 Layers, 3.75 oz."
4,old world taste,"Perfect as an appetizer. Far better than tuna salad to dress-up your sandwich. I keep it around for emergency situations when I run out of fresh stuff. For traditionalists who favor old world taste oil-packed veriety is the way to go. For those who watch their fat intake may be a bit too ""old world""."
2,Nutrition facts upset me,"I purchased four cases of these particular sardines because I am a believer in healthy eating and was attracted to the omega-3 factor and the olive oil. Reading the nutrition facts,however, I was upset to learn that these sardines have 29% saturated fat and 23% cholesterol. Can I swap them for other sardines, at my expense. I was advised that the Brunswick sardines in spring water, with no salt added, are the prefered kind. I, again, accept the responsibility and will pay for additional cost. Would appreciate your guidance. Thank you, S. Norman Reich"
4,Very Good Book,Very interesting book. Gives some good information on how to persuade people to see your point of view and even agree to it. It goes over the 9 basic rules that a person thinks about before he makes his final decision on anything. And it also gives you different ways to persuade people and examples of how it is used.This is the first persuasion book that I've purchased and reading it gave me some very good insight on not just persuasion but on life itself.It also made me want to know more about persuasion and influence.People that should pick up this book:Anyone that wants to get more out of life.
2,One in a long line of throwaway gimmick books. No harm done.,"As a Notre Dame alum, I can only bemusedly shrug and express my condolences for Finebaum's modest literary talent, the primary product of which is his series of ""I Hate"" books (this mercenary oeuvre of literary chaff may be viewed herein by recourse to the author link).Finebaum is as skilled in marketing as in writing, evidenced by his churning out of such perceptive titles as ""I Hate U Maine,"" an institution which garners about as much vitriol as the Public Broadcasting System. A tremendous surprise it is that such brilliant work is now out of print, apparently less successful even than the other stellar tomes in the ""I Hate"" pantheon, each of which dwells in the netherworld of Amazon popularity.Of course, the ultimate justice has already been served, as the best book in the series is titled ""I Hate Paul Finebaum : 303 Reasons Why You Should, Too,"" by Tommy Charles.There is no reason to hate Paul Finebaum. His books speak for themselves."
5,Brave New Houses doesn't disappoint,"Great book with very recent houses. I had seen many of them published in the Sunday LA Times magazine, as well as other places BUT this book provides additional pictures, along with floorplans, and text. The houses represent very current styles and range from small houses to large estates.Very much worth purchasing.PS. the book is paper back and approximately 9"" x 9"" in size"
3,"How ""Brave"" it is depends on the reader","Well... If you've just entered the design world of modern living, the content in this book might be dashing and ""brave"" to you. For most of the readers who are familiar with modern design concept (e.g., me), this book is not ""brave"" at all. Though it is a recently published book, I felt that it does not catch the pace of cutting-edge modern design simple because I could not get excited at all when viewing the pictures. Plus, this book focuses more on interior than architecture. You need to think about what you need from this book before getting a copy."
4,No Installation Problems,"I don't know why so many other reviewers complained about installation problems. This product installed the first time without a single hitch. The product information states that the installation might be unsuccessful if there is a virus in the system, so let the program perform the virus scan when it requests to do so. As far as the interface, it's typical Norton and looks like Norton Internet Security. I did have to search for the anti-virus scanning scheduler which didn't seem to be in a logical place but once found, scheduling scans was easy. The ""one-touch"" feature is a conveinent way to do all the scans that SystemWorks performs. This is a fine product and worthy of the Norton name."
1,14 Years of Norton but never again,"For over fourteen years I had been using Norton's utilities, starting with my first 8088 PC, but I will never purchase any product from Symantec again. Attempting to purchase and update Norton's antivirus utility proved to be one of my most challenging computer tasks to date. Removing all traces of Norton from my system after finally deciding to forgo using Norton was just as difficult. It may have been quicker to have reformatted my hard drives and to have reinstalled all my software - it certainly would have been less frustrating. Norton provided no help in the matter."
1,SystemWorks 2005 one of the worst,"I work with computers, and I have yet to have a successful install of NSW 2005 on over 50 computers. If you desire successful install you must reformat your hard drive and then intall NSW 2005 first before any other programs. On several of my clients I elected just to update the NSW 2004 anti virus subscription, so much easier. Don't waste your time with this version. Norton also, had similar probelms with thier 2003 version, which they repeated denied had any problems, but searching the web found problem after problem with installation."
3,"Pretty good set of programs, terrible to install","It's true, SW2005 does contain pretty useful programs. However, it is also true that it is hard to install. I had the hardest time, so I thought about it, and came up with an EASY AND OBVIOUS SOLUTION TO THIS ABHORRENT MESS! All you have to do, is take out the NSW2005 CD, and uninstall your antivirus 2004, or sw2004, or whatever, reboot, and THEN INSTALL NSW2005. It worked for me. Whatever you do though, if you have Antivirus, and don't like it, do not get Kaspersky! Although probably the best antivirus out there, kaspersky has relational difficulties with Norton, and you have to end up editing your registry values, which is terrible if you don't know how. Other than that, NSW2005 has some extremely useful and lifesaving programs....Enjoy!!!!"
4,The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book,"I have an origional issue of the St. Francis Cook Book given to me by my Uncle, Joseph Meyer. Chef Meyer and Chef Victor Hirtzler came from the same town in Alsace, France. They were close friends and at the time the book was written Chef Meyer was #2 to Hirtzler at the St. Francis. Both Chefs were Black Hats. My Grand Daughter has reciently graduated from the San Francisco Cullinary Achademy, at her graduation party she saw my origional and became very interested in it, I had heard that it had been republished, and went to Amizon and found it. I have given it to her as her Graduation Present. The book for its age is very up to date in the various foumulas I have used through the years. It is a wonderful history of typical cusiene used during the days when the St. Francis, The Palace, etc. were the places to go to get spoiled with service and delicious food."
3,coffee not hot enough,Coffee maker does what it's suppose to do and that's make coffee by the cup. It could be hotter. I have to nuke it before drinking.
4,1 Cup coffeemaker,"I must begin by saying I do not drink coffee. This was purchased to replace a one cup coffeemaker for my husband. He likes his coffee very hot and this takes 6 minutes to perk the cup and it is not as hot as he likes his coffee, but he still likes the coffeemaker considering it was inexpensive."
3,A good value,It's is just ok and gets the job done. Very lightweight and dances around the counter but that being said it was very inexpensive to purchase.
5,just what i was looking for,"I needed to switch from my giant 16 cup coffee maker to something with a tinier foot print and without a carafe to wash. This is perfect for my teeny tiny kitchen, with the added bonus of a paperless filter. Wasn't sure how the quality was going to be for the price, but I'm pretty pleased with the taste of the coffee it produces (actually tastes better than my huge coffee maker) and now I'm finding I need to use less ground coffee per cup to get a flavorful brew. The only down side is that I don't have a travel mug small enough to fit (yet); fortunately, I drink my coffee at home most of the time and it's not a big deal to transfer it to a travel mug if I am on the run. I have even used it to make tea (yerba mate and cocoa-type teas; not regular black or herbal teas, as I'm not sure if the coffee taste would be noticeably transferred) and may even try it for dehydrated soup mixes. Overall I'm very glad to have found this, and at a good price."
3,Economically Brews 1 Cup In Exactly 5 Minutes,"Rated 3 out of 5 based on the following:----Pros----Economically priced 1-cup coffee maker.Reuseable washable coffee filter basket.No need to ever purchase filters or coffee pods.Brew your own favorite coffee or teas.Brewed coffee is rich enough with flavor.----Cons----Using 70 degree cold tap water takes exactly 5 minutes to brew 1 cup.A bit noisy as water percolates and lightly splashes.Doesn't turn-off automatically.Brewed cup is about 145 degrees.Plenty hot, until you add cold cream.Does not support 240V.-------Details-------Product made in China.120V/60Hz 300-watts.7 hole water spreader on drip system.Cup base is not a beverage warmer.Available in white or black.Illuminated on/off rocker switch.Includes filter, measuring spoon, and mug."
2,Not the best coffiee maker,I would not recommend this coffeemaker. It brews a cup very slowly and when finished the coffee is not very hot.
2,too slow,I like a fast cup in am -don't buy this- get the black and decker one cup at a time- it makes the coffee faster and turns off automatically-a feature this maker does not have.
2,Disappointed,I'm disappointed in this little machine: it drips so slowly that the coffee is cold.I have a similar Black and Decker one-cup machine that makes excellent (strong and hot) coffee.
3,So So Coffee Maker,This Coffee Maker is small and quiet but it doesn't haveauto shut off. And it is easy to forget to swing the driptube back after filling coffee. So unless you are goingto sit there and watch it each time I would look for anauto shut off model...
3,Decent Coffeemaker,Bought this coffeemaker for my mother. It does what it says - makes one cup of coffee. Works fine except my mother says it doesn't make the coffee hot enough.
5,A Must for First Time Visitors,This book was extremely helpful in making decisions about what we wanted to do on our recent visit. It seemed to be more detailed on what to see or do in the various locations.
2,Save your money.,"Photoshop Elements 2.0 includes a 254 page manual. This visual quickstart guide is nothing more than a rewrite of the Adobe manual with the addition of scores of low contrast black and white illustrations. It is very well written and is laid out better than the Adobe manual but it offers little that is not already in the Adobe book. If you want a reference manual you don't need this quickstart guide because the Adobe manual is quite satisfactory and comes with the program. If you're looking for a tutorial this quickstart guide is useless. Good tutorials are the books by Scott Kelby, Jan Kabili, and Shane Rebenschied"
5,Have still yet to get it!!!!!,I would of picked a copy after work today- but don't get payed till Friday-- Im hoping to pick a copy up at Wal- Mart!!!!Can't wait till season 3!!
5,Loved it,"Very beautiful. We used it as background music while we had dinner during the reception. No complaints, I definitely recommend it!"
5,Great retention,"I have had a Serpa off duty for my Sig for 4 years now, and this was a great upgrade for my duty holster when I needed a new one. I had no problem with the release mechanics as I have trained with the original CQC for years. I can see how the index finger release would be hard to relearn for some users. Gun fits incredibly well and makes no noise compared to my old Safariland holster."
1,Beretta 96A1 (with rail),I got this level 3 for such a great deal I couldn't pass it up. When it arrived there was a VERY big problem. My Beretta 96A1 with accessory rail will not fit down into the holster. This is the case without any attachments the barrel. As I was attempting to put the gun into the holster the holster was causing the slide to move backwards preventing either the top 'cap' piece from engaging or seating properly so the finger guard catch could engage. Unfortunately I will be sending this back and will continue to search for a different holster.
4,great deliverence-great mystery-great production,I had read the book several times. I was a bit disappointed that Simon the best friend's history was not treated in the show and also Bridie the little girl of the fiancee of the deceased was hardly shown at all. The rest of the production was quite good.
1,"Defective, not detective, DVD","I couldn't watch this DVd, it froze constantly and I actually had to unplug the BOSE player in order to eject it. I've ordered a copy direct from WGBH, it cost much more, but it is a different ISBN and barcode #s, so I'll let you know what happens. This is not the first problem I've encountered w/BBC DVDs. I've seen more recent episodes of this series on TV, and absolutely love it. I'd like to see this first episode to see how it all started..."
1,Don't waste your money on this out of date book,"This book is embarrassingly out of date. The phone numbers, businesses and organizations are either no longer in use, no longer in existence, or no longer relevant. There are countless other ways to find up-to-date information. I'm sure it was useful when it was first produced, but selling this basically useless book to people now is irresponsible and dishonest, and buying it is a waste of your time and money."
2,Theology which halts between two opposing views.,"""... Chosen But Free is a disappointment. More than a mere letdown, actually. It is a stunningly inept treatment of the subject it undertakes. Dr. Geisler manages to misrepresent his friends and foes alike. He utterly mangles the doctrines of divine sovereignty, election, and free will--and in the process he obscures and redefines the historical positions of both Calvinism and Arminianism. The reader who has the regrettable persistence to follow Dr. Geisler to the last page of his work is certain to be hopelessly befuddled at the end of the effort..."""
5,Calvinism vs. Arminianism,"Norman Geisler's ""Chosen But Free, A Balanced View of Divine Election"" is a refreshing answer to the debate that continues to divide Christians regarding the views of calvinism and arminianism. In an understanding and sensible view, he maintains the validity of both the sovereignty and foreknowledge of God and our responsibility to receive or reject God's gift of salvation. Well written and scripturally sound."
2,Synthesis of Aristotle and Soteriology,"The author definitely mangled some scripture to fit his system and that turned me off. I found it goofy that he wholeheartedly supports the idea of God the Holy Spirit ""actuating"" in initiating salvation but rails against the idea of the Spirit ""creating a desire"" in initiating salvation. This book is further proof that we all live on Sixes Road."
1,disappointed,"Bought this pan because the product dimensions stated it was 3 inches deep. (recipe I want to try states need springform pan at least 3 inches deep) The inside depth is closer to 2 1/2 inches because of the leak proof construction, so this is not going to work for me. Picture of product doesn't show this. Probably works great for cheese cake but I already had a good cheese cake pan."
1,Leak proof maybe in space not here on earth though,"I have used Several spring form pans and this one was highly disappointing, I was using it to make a cheesecake for my lovely girlfriend to take to work and I used this pan and it almost completely ruined it, I wouldn't recommend this pan, instead spend the money on tinfoil, a its cheaper and does a better job. Good idea bad production and mine came bent and I had no choice in color."
4,To good to be true!!!!!!!!!!,This product is just to funny.I put a fake cockroach in my mom'sshower and she FREAKED!!!!!!!!The toilet squirter was also cool.When you sat on the toilet it would spray you in the butt!!!!!!!This is probably the best pranks you will get anywhere and its for an amazing price!!!!!I hope you enjoy as much as I did!!!!!!
3,Got it!,"Unfortunately the seller mailed my book to the wrong address and it took a few weeks to get the whole thing sorted out. So I havent had much time yet to get in to this book, but I saw the Truckers animated movie and loved the story."
1,They're called the triangle of death for a reason,"Can't believe they still sell these. If your engine happens to backfire, the foam will immediately catch on fire and the goop can fall all over the carb, rendering it unusable. Just search for ""Edelbrock triangle of death."" They're called that for a very good reason."
3,Works but doesn't last long at all!!!,"I have had this oven mat for a while. When I first bought it, it was GREAT. The food that spilled or dripped or over flowed in the oven slide right off. THEN, about 8 months of use, it started smoking in my oven. Letting moisture under the mat and causing the oven to SMOKE, I'm talking a lot of smoke. I took it out, let it cool for a day, washed it with water and some Dish Soap, scrubbed the ""custed"" parts off... made sure it was 100% dry then..Tried it again. There was no food or water in my oven just pre-heating and it started smoking again. So I finally threw it away. I don't think I will ever purchase another one of these again. I am still unsure why it started smoking in the first place. Just use Foil. Much safer and less smokey!"
1,Melted The First Time It Was Used,This got one star for easy cleanup. It was used one time at 350 degrees and melted in two places. Instructions are confusing. If you have an hidden element you are to put it on the oven rack. Mine is an electric/convection and do not consider the heating element to be hidden. It's not vented but having a solid bottom so I followed the instructions to place it on the bottom. It is flimsy although I would have been OK with it had it not melted. I am returning it.
1,one star,"I rated this one star because I had to give it one star to leave a review. Although I received this item quickly, I was very, make that HUGELY disappointed. I looked everywhere in the description to make sure this was a ""bottom of the oven floor"" (no hidden heating element) item. When I got it, of course,it has to go on the bottom RACK and is of no use to me. Boo. No stars."
1,Zero stars if i could,"I just came by this and had to set these reviews straight. I was dooped into getting this back in the day and its the worst mixed album I've ever herd. He comes off (BAD) on every mix that straine to go past 32 beats and the tracks arent even that good out side of a few. The two people who reviewed this have no clue what good is, so please if for some unknown reason u want to get this 10 year old mix DONT."
2,Inferior Product,"The Pro Form line from Nordic Ware is a big disappointment. I was so happy to see this bundt pan at this price because I didn't want to pay almost $30 for the heavy cast aluminum version. Unfortunately, it performs just about the same as other $6 low price pan which makes this overpriced as is. The trouble with this pan is that the design is not molded deep enough so that the cake doesn't come out with the clean clear lines that the pictures would suggest. It's also awfully light; feels very flimsy. Finally, don't be fool by the picutre on page, it shows the heavy cast version with deep indented lines, the real Pro Form version doesn't look this good."
1,mopar valve cover gaskets,Absolutely garbage. Only one gasket came and it was broken up into many pieces. The package appeared very old and water damaged. I would never purchase from this supplier again. Better off going to your local auto parts store.
