3,Just don't trust it on the road,"Nice enough for the trail when you're on foot and not depending on it to tell you how to get somewhere. But it has turned me the wrong way on the road more times than not, one time it told me to turn left when the route it was displaying turned right.Also its plug locations are just plain stupid. You may want to pop for a bracket if you do use it in the car--but then if you want a road worthy navigtor, look elsewhere.Otherwise the software is quirky and the maps quite expensive."
3,Time Zones,"Garmin has several features that relate to the time of day. Some examples are sun & moon times, estimated time of arrival. If you have traveled into a different time zone out of your original setting, the GPS unit leaves it up to you to calculate the correct time based on your original setting. This is very inconvenient when you have traveled from the west coast to the east coast thru four time zones. It also provides a problem when your destination is right on a time zone border. A Cell Phones automaticly changes for time zones, but NOT a GPS unit that can calculate exactly where you are in the world???? This is a Garmin overlook that I believe they should correct."
3,Great Geocaching unit with some frustrations,Defect in the altimiter function (no graphing) with little factory feedback after multiple attempts to reach support.Otherwise FAST signal updates and unbelievable accuracy!Reception is reliable as well.I have owned 5 gps prior...other than the frustration with POOR (NO) factory support it is GREAT!
2,Doesn't work at high volume.,"After finding impressive online reviews, I bought my Logi...Z-3i speakers almost a month back. However, I paid only 30 dollars, I am completely dissatisfied by the fact that break down at max volume. Soon, they will be dispatched back to Amazon. However, I am not sure whether its only me who received this defective unit or is it a widespread defect. I used them with my Dell laptop and checked all the connections, wires, and my laptop but the problem seems to reside with the speakers. So be careful!!"
5,a life changer,"This book was given to me by a stranger at a Catholic Youth Conference. I didn't want to read it, but I did... in one day. I couldn't put it down. This book is a life changer. Even if you are not a Catholic, this is a must read!!!!"
5,"its healing, soothing","I love this cd, I really do, the lrics are safe and soothing, they really speak to you. "" Listen "" is what I like to listen to especially on rainy days, it just makes you want to know how to dance. I have all of her cds, but this one remains the one I liked the best."
2,Horrible accent and no chemistry,"""Half-Pint"" from ""Little House on the Prairie"" dons a cheesy and uneven French accent while mourning the death of her much older husband and son, as she neglects her surviving child. When her daughter befriends a divorced artist, they form an unlikely friendship which turns to romance.I had a difficult time refraining from wincing from Glbert's atrocious accent, which brings the film down a notch or two. The performances overall are okay, but the story is entirely too predictable. There was more chemistry between the daughter and the love interest - I just didn't get the feel that these two suddenly became soul mates. Gilbert's accent was just so distracting and annoying; the only actress to pull off a worse accent is perhaps Jennifer Love Hewitt in ""The Truth About Love"" which is another must miss."
3,Enjoyable,"Enjoyed the movie, but didn't think it was as good as previous Danielle Steel movies made from her books."
1,Software Not Working,"I bought this software for my son, based on the reviews I read on Amazon.com. The software is not working. I have notified Terzio, two times and no response. I just wasted my money on a game that does nothing!"
4,"Great product, but...","Great product. I'm learning how to play chess for the first time, as well as my 7 year old son... However, tech support is not the best - my program gets an error message during the IntelliGym, and can't move forward. I contacted the tech people via e-mail, but it took them nearly two weeks to get back to me. Suggested solution didn't work, and haven't heard back from them yet. Hopefully, you won't have any tech problems, then you'd love the product, I'm sure.(I think my problem might be my OS, which is W2000 - even though the product discription in Amazon states it works with W2000, the CD I have says 95, 98, ME, XP. So W2000 uesrs be aware...)"
3,good for older kids,I would recommend this product for older kids. Not for introducing to younger kids. I find the Dinasour CHess very good for beginners. My 4 year old son really grasped the basic concepts of Chess very well by playing Dinasour chess
1,No Instructions - you and your kid will be asleep,You and your kid will be asleep by the time you figure out what to do next. This may be the worst instructional software I ever purchased.
1,System Requirements,"Never got to use this game ... Amazon Product description said game was compatible with Windows 2000, but when I received the game; the box does not list ""2000"" among the compatable operating Systems. On the plus side, Amazon accepted responsibility and provided prepaid return shipping."
4,Good Chess Training for Kids,"My 11 year old boy loves this chess training software. It is has taught him chess how to move and the tactics of every chess piece, which has made him a much better chess player. The only drawback is that you cannot stop and go back to where you left off, but you have to start all over again, which was very frustrating to my boy. I hope they fixed this problem in the subsequent additions of this software."
4,Dying from Dioxin : A Citizen's Guide to Reclaiming Our Heal,"Many people are unaware of how detrimental Dioxin, a toxic waste byproduct that occurs when chlorine is burned and when other organic chemicals that contain chlorine are manufactured, is on health. This book reviews the studies that confirm the correlation to Dioxin and disease/health problems, such as endometriosis, cancer, birth defects, learning disorders. This books provides a good synopsis and indepth review of Dioxin supported by scientific research. Lois Marie Gibb's Dying from Dioxin is as revealing as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. This book is a must for environmental/health activists, parents, teachers, health practitioners, and anyone who cares about health."
2,Riding a wave...,"Sylvie Matton is simply riding the Tracey Chevalier wave. Unfortunately, she is not a good enough surfer and crashes before the break. A boring book, a pale imitation."
5,What a powerful story told...........,"Yes I'm a man and I found this story to be very true andhonest. If we could just take a moment to see what ourblack sisters are going thru maybe we as men would not takethem so lightly. I found Ms. Browning's book to be very moving.I felt I could cry,laugh kill and a host of other things whilereading this book. Ms. Browning I can say you really capturedmy attention and I loved the book. When will the sequel hitthe shelf."
2,DANG IT.....,"Why does the cover have some old dude in the woods making Shine..... and none of that is the book!!!This BookMay help you, i JUST now ordered it after finding out i got skunked on this Corn Whiskey book and onThis One.Dont get me wrong, im glad i bought them both. Id just like to know how and neither one of these books had ALL the information i would need.If your gonna follow my lead, at this point in time i would suggest you do read this book 2nd.... if your like me and dont even have a clue about making your own booze. Then read this corn whiskey book... and finish off reading The Secrets book.Thanks for reading this review, read what i said about that other book (books when the one i hope is great shows up) i my profile.Hope that helps you make a choice here!"
4,MAKING PURE CORN,THIS was a very helpful guide to understanding the craft and art behind the hobby I would recomend it to anyone with interest in the art and craft*)O(* barry shankman
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"the film may have been made in the 60's but the modern martial arts movie do not hold a candle to the ""zatoichi"" series."
1,Let me be an individual!!,"In the world of the fundamentalist there are only two ways a woman can be ...a sterotype and for God or a rebel not conforming to sterotypes and roles which is viewed as being against God. Everything about my personality,abilities and temperment run up against the writers narrow view of what a woman ""should"" be. If you are a woman with a strong personality,a sexual being and able to do higher maths..you might not want to read this book because it is sure to make you want to hate every fundamentalist you have ever met.I don't go around hating people but this group of Christian sect is so sexist and generalistic that it makes one want to become anything they don't want you to be! Women are individuals,,,we don't all have the same low level feminine abilities,..sarcasism there,and we don't all have a problem figuring our lives out without a man...and we don't all have visions of love and romance dancing around in our heads!"
4,Great..... (except for),"Exactly what my wife wanted...... Except for the fact that the hands and numerals are not as black as the photos show.We wanted more contrast..... Hands and numerals are black and outlined in gold which make them harder for old people to see.The photo of the watch shows them to be more bold.Other than that its a great watch, thank you."
1,JUNK DONT BUY,"i HAVE A PANASONIC 2.4 GHz MODEL NO. KX-TG2235B,EVERY TIME I PLUG IT IN ALL THE LIGHTS ON BASE(CHARGE,SPEAKERPHONE,V/M) LIGHTS JUST CONTINUSLY BLINK OFF AND ON,PHONE WILL NOT EVEN WORK OR CHARGE,PANASONIC WONT PAY FOR S&H TO FIX OR THE PARTS NEED TO FIX"
4,Good for what it does,"This press is very small so doing multiple flowers seems to be an endless task. However if color is very important, then this is the press to use. I usually do roses and other thicker blossoms with this press and anything that has an especially vibrant or unusual color. For larger flowers and amounts of flowers, I use a traditional wooden press. I would recommend it because the color quality is so good but would also recommend it be supplemented with the wooden type. If you do few blossoms at a time, then just this one would be appropriate."
1,very smelly indeed,"I had read the first review, but went ahead and ordered it anyway as this was the exact model my wife asked for.first i ordered it on 12-21 with the next day air option to ensure delivery by 12-23. fat chance! i received it 12-27 a full week after ordering. when it didnt arrive on 12-24 i went to wally world (walmart) and picked up a $39 massager which had several motors for the upper back shoulders (total 9 ) just to have something under the tree. upon arrival of the homedics, not only did it smell very bad, which was understated by the previous review, but was uncomfortable especially the neck part. (which was the reason for choosing this model) and was underpowered compared to the $39 model at walmart.we have a homedics hand massager which we love, i guess this is one time the higher priced item was NOT better.the control unit was also a better quality than that of the homedics unit.we returned the homedics and can not recommend it.look else where."
3,Cool but too tall for muddler stick,"The 4 glasses are cool looking, with heavy ribbed glass, rounded bottoms and cigar band screen printing. They are, however, taller than any muddler stick that I've found. Which means you cannot make mojitos in them, unless you own a tall wooden spoon. The recipes are interesting, but printed on a folded sheet, not in booklet form. And there is nothing to muddle with. So, not really a kit (""gift set"" is a bit misleading) and more of a nice set of tall glasses that appeal to both men and women."
2,LET DOWN!,"I too expected to see more shots of the incredible New York studio musicians who recorded this music. Instead, I saw boring, out-of-date, psychedelic graphics... ho-hum! 5 stars for the musicians and Dave Grusin's burnin' big band charts, 1 star for the DVD. What a waste!"
5,"""MR. BERNSTEIN WOULD BE PROUD""","This has got to be one of the greatest ""West Side Story"" albums made since the Oscar Peterson Trio album. It's so good that I think even Mr. Bernstein would love it."
2,"THIS IS THE FOLLOW UP, AND VERY POOR VERSION OF HER FIRST ONE","This book has almost the same title as her first book from 1987, Italy the Beautiful Cookbook. This one is called Italy today the Beautiful cookbook. This one is as bad as her first was good... pass on this one and order her first one."
2,Listen to Hatebreed instead,"Throwdown sounds more like the hXc punk version of Hatebreed. If you do like heavy heavy music, then disregaurd this review. I LOVE heavy music, but I do appreciate some melody, or range in vocals. This album isnt all bad although. I'd bet Throwdown puts on a hell of a live show. The drums and guitars are nothing worth writing home about, and lyrics are completely straightedge sometimes. The album is completely repetitive and every song sounds like a filler. Listen to As I Lay Dying instead."
5,What was Rhett's motto?,"Who was the 1st actress to do a screen test for the part of Scarlett?Well answers to these and almost 2,000 other questions are in this complete and entertaining GWTW reference, the only official companion to Margaret Mitchell's classic novel.It is illustrated with stills from the movie (B&W;) and delightful memorbilia, this carefully researched compendium has enough riveting trivia, behind the scenes dish and mind boggling quizzes to capture the fascination of every devoted fan"
4,"Although Somewhat Dated, Still a Must for any Serious Collector","Anyone interested in collecting date nails must have this book. Yes, it is somewhat dated and to a certain degree obsolete. Nevertheless, this book is the quintessential companion to the Date Nail ""bible"" _Date Nails Complete_. It provides an excellent overview of the WESIS ""type"" categorization system.Any serious Date Nail collector will also want to get _Date Nails and Railroad Tie Preservation_ by Jeff Oats. (Contact 317-781-8799)"
3,"Fair product, bad pairing instructions","The BT150 seems fair enough as a headset: comfortable, good audio signals for on and off, and no echo my callees have noticed. It loses pairing with my cell (a Treo 700P) frequently. That's a problem. So are the incomplete instructions from Jabra for entering pairing mode. They've stymied two Verizon technicians...but one had the secret:* press power (and keep on holding...)* at first blink, press and hold + (while still holding power)* when solid blue, release all buttons* pair to phone"
3,Book is excellent; reproduction is not,"Do yourself a favor and get the original version of this book. The reprint looks like a low-quality photocopy, with small areas of text on huge pages; and the excellent photography all disappears into a badly bitmapped mess."
4,Edison's Best Years,This is the one volume of the three by Francis Jehl that describes the most important historical events in Edison'sareer.
5,paul: a man of grace,another great book by chuck swindoll. this is insightful reading about the best christian who ever lived apart from Jesus Christ Himself. worth the time and money.
2,Good basic textbook on IPO's,"If you're lookin for an extensive overview of all the basic theories of IPOs, this is a good book. It's like an ""IPOs for Dummies"". Focus is a bit too much on Underpricing, however. I missed good overviews of Long Term Underperformance and Hot Issue Markets. Quite old (1996) so a lot of important work is not covered. New version was released 1999."
2,"Great Idea, Too Complicated","The concept is that you take the watch off and slap it on your bike. However, getting it on the bike is too time-consuming to be useful to me. You have to remove both straps with a tool to be able to attach it to the clip on your handlebars. When you're ready to run again, you have to reattach the watch straps again. It took me about a minute to do this each time. I had assumed I could just attach the watch without removing the straps."
4,Exactly what I needed,"It did exactly what I needed - allowed me to connect my Forerunner to my bike. It installs fairly easily and the Forerunner clips in/out fairly nicely. Even after a 25 mph crash in a race, it held tight. It's nice that it comes with extra pins in case some are lost."
4,Works Well,If running is your focus and cycling is a hobby/cross training avenue then the quick release kit for the Forerunner is the way to go vice buying the Garmin Edge 205/305. The wrist strap is velcro and as a result very adjustable but it will need to be washed/rinsed occasionally if you sweat. The watch cradle for the bike is mounted with zip ties and very easy with needle nose plyers and scissors the only tools needed.
3,"Good, and then again not so good","First: This is not a Scandinavian, but a Nordic Baking Book. The Scandinavian Countries are three - the two on the Scandinavian peninsula - Sweden and Norway, and the peninsula popping up from continental Europe - Denmark. Iceland and Finland do not belong to Scandinavia. Together with the Scandinavian countries, they constitute the Nordic countries.Then: The book is not complete - far from complete. Then it is a little misleading to name it the ""great"" baking book. Norwegian baking seems to be somewhat under-represented by numbers. Being born in Bergen, Norway, I miss core recipes from my hometown's baking, like the famous ""skillingsbolle"" (cinnamon roll). Where is the famous Swedish ""spettkaka""? Why are Norwegian waffles named in Swedish (""vfflor"") and not Norwegian (""vafler)?"
5,One of the best Instant Memories book!,"I am addicted to Instant Memories clip Art. However, ""Love"" and ""Family"" are far the best. The quality, beauty and selection is unbelievable.I do not like digital scrap. (However this product is perfect for the digital scrapper.)I want dimension and ability to add my own choices. The pages provide incredible inspiration for handmade additons as wll as cutouts to fit your pages.I hope people catch on to the goldmine. I have a huge collection of clip art from upscale and popular sites. However none of them equal the quality of these books and CD."
4,Near Masterpiece,"After I heard ""Brownstone"" for what must have been the tenth time on the radio, I *finally* heard the DJ say it was by Maia Sharp. That one song is worth buying the albm for- and it's a very good album indeed."
3,Very strange book,"This book is really very strange, with combinaions of history, fantasy, Arthurian legends, and the myth of the Holy Grail. It goes from Korea to the United States, to Canada, Europe and Africa. There are historical characters mixed in with the fictional ones, and it's very difficult to tell when the historical folks are acting as they would have in reality. The story is quite convoluted, and keeps skipping back and forth in time, and also in place, so that your head begins to spin at times. I can't fault the writing, because it is good, but there's just too much oddity going on to rate it any higher than I have."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"Signoricci by Nina Ricci for Men is a light, yet long lasting citrus scented fragrance with a very light spice/woods hint. Although recommended for evening use, I find it reminds me of the Caribbean when wearing light colored linen or silk. Ive used it for years and its predecessor, Monsieur Ricci for men and been extremely pleased. For Northern climates (I live in Fla) I'd wear something bolder/deeper like Jaipur. Highly recommend."
2,Look at it as a diamond in the rough,"The author asserts that Jefferson begot children with his slave and reminds the reader that this was not usual or shocking behavior for many antebellum Southern men. This book is amusing because of it's high spirited, conversational style and because of it's flaws. It could've been a very good book if only Mr. Sloan had sought out the services of a copy/content editor. The technical problems with the book are just too distracting."
5,i think its good!,"i think its an interesting cd from a mixed group of musicians , blackmore track is excellent, and also stevens track . worth checking out!"
5,Excellent Little Book,"If you have read any of the author's other ""....of Wisconsin"" books and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this one. It's a similar layout, and makes for interesting reading even if you are not out in the wild actually trying to ID flowers. If you have not read his other Wisconsin books, which cover trees, mammals, and birds, I highly recommend it. The author also has many other books covering other states."
2,200 flowers is not enough,"While the images in Wildflowers of Wisconsin are full page and generally of good quality with good written information on the opposing page, it only covers 200 wildflowers! A good guide should have five times that amount. The Index only has common names, making it of limited value for looking up wildflowers. Overall not bad for the price, but of limited value if one is truly interested in learning the wildflowers of Wisconsin."
3,An entertaining read.,"Marcus and Eliza set off sparks from day one, but I found the story more interesting when after they are caught in a compromising position and her cousin Julian is forced to marry her. He dies and Eliza is forced to support herself and her aunt by being a tutor for Marcus's twin nieces. Marcus has been taking solace in the form of brandy because his brother is dead, he's scarred and his damaged hand is constantly in pain. The story seemed to pick up once he and Eliza married, and I like the way the author managed to make Eliza compassionate towards Marcus despite what happened. She vows that each night she's going to work on his hand, get him to use it instead of turning to the bottle to dull the pain."
3,Great features -- poor battery life,"Excellent features on the phone. I work at home often and wanted one with clarity, mute button, many memories, caller ID, speaker phone and a headset jack.The only complaint is the battery life. After 2.5 hours of use it dies. Then it takes 6 hours to charge to full capacity.Bottom line: Great phone for features and for casual use. Bad phone for business use when you are on constant conference calls."
1,There's a class action lawsuit for this series of models,"I bought the base and two handsets 2 yrs ago, and one of the handset completely stopped working after 1.5 yrs. After a year, we replaced the rechargable battery in every handsets, but one of the handsets started loosing it's power very quickly (we charge for 6 hrs and it lasted for 10 minutes), and then stopped working.There's an ongoing class action lawsuit against the series KXTG and KXTC in NJ, and the law firm encourages every consumer, regardless of state, who had any problems with these models to fill out a questionaire at their website (they only ask for your name, email address, state, and comment). http://www.sheller.com/Practice.asp?PracticeID=140"
4,Satisfied,"Lamp is very sturdy. Had trouble adding the pine cones. The cone's threads were off center and I could not attach them correctly. The company was quick to respond and replace the two problem cones. Otherwise, nice lamp."
4,Nice flower press,"Nice flower press. Works well, just takes some experimenting to see what works best. Fun craft project, good quality item."
3,Was A Gift - I do not rate this item,"I purchased this item as a gift; since I have not personally used it, it is impossible for me to give it a rating."
2,More than everything you want to know,"A disappointment, especially when compared to other books by this usually excellent author. Mr. Ambrose has taken material that should fit into a 50- to 75-page pamphlet and expanded it to book length. He does this by repeating similar information ad nauseam: for example, on page 345 of the normal print edition he states, "". . . that day laid 4.2 miles of track. The next day, it set down 3.1 miles, and the day after that, 4.6."" Time after time we read similar statistics. Who cares?Because of the extensive annotations, this book might be useful for someone as a bibliography for further research on the subject. But one wonders if Ambrose has left anything unsaid. I note that another reviewer has questioned the accuracy of some of his assertions.Frankly, a bore."
4,Dying for more maps,"He does a good job with the story, but seldom have I seen a book with such a critical need for additional maps. It is hard to picture the route of the CP throught the mountains, and time and time again cities are mentioned along the UP route that cannot be found on the larger maps. There are several issues regarding route changes which would lend themselves to maps."
4,Good read,A very informative book. Interesting read about how one of the greatest infrastructure projects was executed. I learned a lot about probably the first public-private partnership in the US and which players had the most influence.
3,"Informative, but repetative","Found this to be an informative read, however, it was very repetative in places. We see the same stories told over in different parts of the book. Could use more editing.As for the writing itself, I found it a bit bland. Did not have great flow and found myself struggling to finish it.I am interested in the subject and learned quite a bit, although was frustrated about how much more time he spent chronicling the business end of the building as opposed to the human side."
3,"good, for a first draft...","While this is a good account of the building of the transcontinental RR, this book is an apparent product of the Stephen Ambrose book factory putting quantity over quality. There are some obvious quote and description repetitions and the organization is a little sloppy. I think some thorough editing could have made this book great. I'm a big fan of Ambrose's previous works and do recommend this book despite these disappointments."
3,Good insights,"The editorial style is pretty choppy. However, Ambrose does an excellent job of giving information. The story is complete and the level of research that done is very deep. The human nature of hope, greed, legacy, and corruption is clearly shown. This book shows the opening of the west by Americans shown not as The White Satan as is popular in history books today, nor as The White Savior as was popular in the past, but has human beings intent on a goal not comprehending how it would change the country forever."
3,Mediocre book,"I was excited about this book after, I believe, hearing the author on a radio show, but after reading the book I'm disappointed.The story was interesting, but the organization of the book did not hold my attention. There was a lot of repitition between chapters. I read quotes and remembered them from previous chapters.I didnt really find myself associating with the players of the era either.There are some nice pictures in the book."
1,Poor Editing,Anyone who enjoys Stephen Ambrose would be well advised to skip this book. It suffers from terrible editing that produced a very repetive narrative with numerous and inexplicable errors.
3,God Bless America!,"Great story but disappointing delivery. I nearly disposed of the book after the first few chapters: too much ""could only happen in the USofA"" for me. However, after about 100 pages the story begins and it gets interesting, the politics, corruption and downright foul play to get the railroad built are nearly as fascinating as the imagery of the real heros, the men who surveyed, designed and built the thing."
2,Disappointingly superficial,"I picked this up anticipating as fine a book as ""Undaunted Courage,"" but was seriously disappointed. It is quite superficial; even acknowledging Ambrose's desire to focus on those who actually built the railroad, the business and political aspects are given short shrift. Ambrose (or, rather, his cadre of researchers) has done a pretty good job of digging up information about what it was like to actually be building the railroad, and the various personal anecdotes are the best part of the book. But it suffers from very poor editing (several anecdotes are repeated nearly verbatim, and at least one blatant error exists) and has the feel of something that Ambrose knocked off quickly because his editor wanted him to write it. But it did picque my interest sufficiently to make me want to read a more serious treatment of the subject."
2,A Bit Thin for My Taste,Ambrose disappoints me in this work. I expected a great deal more and I have read better books on the topic. All in all---it's a wash.
3,Disappointed,"I thought that I was buying a new book as a gift, but the book has a magic marker hash mark across the outside tops of the pages.The book itself is a wonderful and intriguing account... a very good read."
4,Lots of momentum in this book.,"I read this book in 4 nights. It's perfect for people who are interested in finding out more about the building of the transcontinental railroad but who don't want all of the nitty gritty. It really reads like an adventure story in so many ways. I don't give it 5 stars because there is some strange repetition of quotes and stories throughout the book, especially towards the end where it looks like the author and editor ran out of steam. I kept flipping back trying to find where I had read that particular story before. But I truly enjoyed this book!!"
2,A minor work,"Ambrose's book seems cobbled-together. He indicates in the ""Acknowledgements"" section that the idea for the subject came from his editor, and a good deal of the research appears to have been done by others.There are disconcerting repetitions in the work, such as the recycling of a quote of General Sherman within 40 pages (cf. pgs. 226 and 266), virtually identical descriptions of UP rail-laying (cf. pgs. 180 and 276)and telegraph-pole laying (cf. pgs. 257 - 314-15). This suggests a lack of attention either by the writer (if, indeed, it was Ambrose throughout) or by the editor, or both.It is unclear that this work was necessary in that Dee Brown's ""Hear that Lonesome Whistle Blow"", as a nonscholarly history of the railroad, was at least as good, and perhaps better. Prof. Bain's ""Empire Express"" is the definitive work in this area for the time being."
2,success has made Ambrose lazy,"This is not a very good book. Not exciting, not well written, not very good history. Not ony is Ambrose talking down to us, he seems neither to care deeply about his subject nor to have masterered it very thoroughly. For a good read on building the railroad, try David Bain's EMPIRE EXPRESS. For a good book of history try Diana Muir's BULLLOUGH'S POND. Or read some of Ambrose's early work, that was good stuff."
5,A classic study in a controversial field,"Humans make decisions under uncertainty. Our evaluations are subject to unconscious heuristics and biases. Rosenthal shows that our decisions about how to design experiments and how to interpret the results are subject to bias, sometimes with serious results. For the person who believes that professional scientists can somehow easily ""control"" bias away, Rosenthal is an important counterargument. This work used to be very widely studied, in graduate programs in many disciplines. It appears to have gone out of fashion, but the problems documented by Rosenthal have most certainly not gone away."
2,"good looking, ages fast","Seiko has outlived its reputation: this watch is way too expensive for its cheap gold plating finish. I thought it was gold-fill which would last longer than six months...now it looks like a cheap timex or worse.(I think Gold-Tone is a colored paint, like fingernail polish)"
2,Hello Hello R U there?,"Bought this system to update existing Panasonic phone. Found instructions easy to read. Phone prompts, altough at first intimidating, is quite easy to manage. Styling works well for me. HOWEVER, The volume is POOR at best even with the feature volume booster in ON mode..Now, I know why Panasonic added the phone booster. Consider carefully! Bobby"
1,Would like to have it!,It would be nice to have a dependable shipper that would ship my product to the proper city.There is a big difference in Houston and Austin.
5,country flavor cookbook,"i have owned this cookbook for 40 years and as yet have not found a bad recipe in it! the fish chowder is amazing and so is the corn bread. in recent years i've bought it for both sons. it's basic down home cooking, but it's the recipe book i always go to when i need to bring something for thanksgiving and christmas dinners."
1,Over priced and inadequate,"The book only covered about 25% of the subject. This requires that you purchase other books, at a lower cost, that will cover the material as intended."
4,Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream,"This cream was extremely gentle to my sensitive skin, it did not make me break out at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I needed more moisturization than it provided."
1,Dermalogica Smoothing cream is the best,Dermalogica is a great product and you can't beat the price Amazon has for it.Amazon stands by their guarantee and I appreciate their service. I will always shop through Amazon for products because of their fast service to insure you receive the product you ordered on time.
2,QUE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered these headphones since I couldnt get the v2 headphones shipped out here (I'm deployed) I got the headphones pretty fast so I cant complain about that. But as for the quality I was completely disappointed. the right ear went out a week after I got them. Dont buy this stick with the Zune v2 headphones.
2,Don't buy if you want to run with them.,"I gave these headphones a 2 because they were very cheap. I do like the sound quality very much, but when it comes to fitting in the ears, it's a pain. I don't like the fact that I have to cram them in my ears to get them to stay in, even after changing to the smallest bud size. The case is neat and they don't tangle much, but if you want to do anything active while wearing them, forget it. I couldn't get these to stay in my ears at all when I ran. Unless you plan on sitting or standing in a stationary spot while you use them, don't get them."
1,Zune Premium Earphones Waste of Time and Money,The earphones that come with the Zune player are by far superior to the Zune Premium Earphones. This product advertises a expanded bass feature...WRONG!!!. These earphones have absolutely no bass whatsoever. I owned these earphones about 5 hours before I returned them and got my money back.
2,Zune Premium Earphones,"While it has multiple sizes, the earphones do not fit well. They also do not have clear sound coming through them, unless you press them firmly into your ear. Lots of vibration sound and actually makes it sound like they are blown."
1,Zune is a great product. Its sad that many of the accessories for it are not.,"The sound quality from these headphones was an upgrade from the original headphones included with the Zune, especially as it relates to bass response.HOWEVER, there are several cons to this product. First of all, even though there are three different sized sleeves included for getting the best fit, these earbuds are EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. Just very bulky, not ergonomically designed to fit in the ear at all.And finally, I ended up having them a total of three days before the left earpiece stopped working. Returned them to Amazon for a refund. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Just plain terrible,These headphones are absolutly horrible. First- it is nearly impossible to get a good seal so that it sounds halfway decent. After i had these for three weeks of easy listening one of the earbuds decided to die and become very quiet. Since then i have bought skullcandy full metal jackets and they are infinatly better. And since i only paid 25$ for them it was a great deal. Another issue i have with these headphones is that even before you get them out of the case the way that it is wrapped up makes the wire have a bunch of kinks.
3,"Sounds is good, but earbuds are disappointing",The price for these headphones was unbeatable and the sound is very good. I was largely looking for earbuds that fit my ears better and in this area I was disappointed.
4,High Quality,This is a top quailty product. The sound is awesome. I love it and would recommend to others. The case is nice and handy for storage.
4,Pretty decent for the price,"Earphones arrived by the deadline and in great condition. They are comfortable and have a nice sound. Overall, I think they're pretty decent earbuds for the price."
5,Siren Song of the South,"I left rural Georgia 25 years ago. This book has filled me with longings for what I left behind, and an insatiable desire to discover what I naively overlooked - namely, the rich and tragic ecological history of southern Georgia."
5,alright Merritt J. Vincent,"Unlike many recordings given 5 star ratings on amazon[.com], this one actually deserves it. If you like Brookmeyer, or if you like west coast jazz or cool jazz at all, you should be very interested in this highly creative work. I'm not sure exactly what Brookmeyer and his gang were going for, but what they succeeded in doing was taking old, old tunes (from the 1920s, etc.) and giving them a fresh, swinging, 1960s feel, without losing the their essential old-fashioned aspects. The result is some seriously interesting, seriously delightful music."
1,Disappointed,"I love sourdough bread, but this is not close to that. The bread has a sour, unpleasant taste, a gummy texture, and a horrible aroma. I will never buy this again."
3,BEWARE,"I bought this compilation even though I already had a single-disc Pat Boone best-of because mine didn't include his Little Richard covers, Tutti Frutti and Long Tall Sally, as well as At My Front Door and some of the minor hits. But when I listened to this, I discovered that every track from I Almost Lost My Mind to If Dreams Came True were not the original Dot mono recordings, but rather the stereo re-recordings that Boone made in 1959. His early 60's hits Moody River and Speedy Gonzales, of course, were done only in stereo, so these are the original recordings, as are Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally, and At My Front Door. But if you are a stickler for historical accuracy and insist on the original hit recordings, you may think twice about spending $27 on this."
4,Almost perfect,"This is an excellent collection of Pat Boone's hits. His fans will love it. However, I was disappointed that the versions of the songs preceding April Love were not the original single recordings as in my Pat's Great Hits vinyl album, although the arrangements are very close. But since the album title is ""Singles"", I expected the original recordings."
2,Olympus battery replacement,Even when new these batteries (I bought 2) do not hold a charge well at all. Only about 30 pics & my original Olympus battery which is now 7 years old keeps a charge for twice as long. I have now owned 4 of these replacement batteries & they all have the same problem. Also sometimes they do not connect well with the charger & I have to clean the contacts with alcohol. The price is right however & if you can constantly be charging them it works OK.
4,Interesting with a mix of the old and new,"It's not everyday you see DJ's sample both Bone Thugs 'N Harmony and Depeche Mode on the same CD. Overall, there is a nice, continuously melow feel - even with the tracks with Bomb the Bass and Aphrodelics lyrics and samples.It's fairly relaxing without putting you to sleep and hits hard and often with bass that I'm sure my neighbors don't appreciate. Also, the more jump-up tracks don't seem out of place. Overall a pretty good CD."
5,Excellent,"loved the cd, its on the top of my music list. Disc two is pretty good, but disc one is perfect."
5,The twisties now have thier own soundtrack,"Imagine youself in your car, its 2am on a saturday morning. You feel the wind across your ears and the clutch under your foot. If your in my shoes, it's a german car, the car the BBC and Top Gear favor. Your cresting a turn at 80mph and your enjoying every precious minute of it. Now at that instance you go to turn on your radio. You don't want music to interupt, you want it to add, to be a subtle motivation, your own cheer squad. That radio station would be this CD, subtle and enjoyable. Everything you could enjoy as your enjoy everything they enjoy. BBC's Top Gear is the Soundtrack to your driving expereince. Its an import so it'll set you back a fair shilling, but it's worth it. ey mate"
5,Freaking Amazing,This game's combat system makes the Castlevania series worth playing again. Since Symphony of the Night I've been yearning for something and this game was my answer. It is simply incredible. A must have for all Castlevania fans!
3,the wrong thing,This item will not do what I needed. It turns out that this was the wrong thing for me to buy. This was because there was not detailed enough pictures for me to be able to tell that it would not do the job.
3,Arrangements of non-original material pleasing,"I too have a critical ear and have attended all his performances when he has come to town. Admittably, this CD was bought by my wife for me. She did so by the artist, not the content. I was disappointed by the contents initially and had high expectations of a new David Lanz CD. Only the first track is an original and it does stand out as the Lanz that I expect. David does a great job of transforming these songs to a solo piano format. No one else could have done this to these songs nearly as well. That aspect of it is enjoyable. This CD should be purchased with that in mind. Do not expect Skyline Firedance, but do add this to your collection."
2,a quintessential text with somewhat inaccessible translation,"While the mere availability of this text in english is certainly extraordinary and invaluable, the translation and writing will obstruct some of its benefit for most readers. The author's reliance on latin terminology, as well as an unwillingness to use conventional and/or literal tranlations of sanskrit and tibetan terms, makes this a difficult read. I would never describe this book as ""readable""- just the opposite. As noted in other reviews, there is a wealth of information in the chapters leading up to the translation, but they suffer from the same faults. While I am grateful to Dr. Pettit for publishing this work, I look forward to the release of a new translation."
5,Syn. with my toshiba satelliet A 85,"Worth the price, works on my 4G first gen. nano and toshiba laptop! Great Stuff!"
2,my wife didn't really like the smell of cigarette.,"I rated 2 star because on the description it didn't mention about the strong smell of cigar, and that could be a second hand smock my wife was disappointing about it and I have to do something about the smell so much that I was to the point of returning it but after few days out side and spraying a lots of perfume on it we got raid-of the strong smell of cigarette."
1,How did this book get published?,"John Weitz, the son of an upper class Jewish refugee from Hitler's Germany, has possibly written the worst history in history. After reading this book, I discovered that Mr. Weitz's primary occupation was a fashion designer, with the avocation of international playboy. It shows in his writing. ""Hitler's Diplomat"" has got to be the most poorly written book I have ever read. It is simply atrocious. More than a few sentences are simply incomprehensible. Most of the rest is just bad, bad, amateurish, high school level writing. The purported subject of the book- Joachim von Ribbentrop- is ignored for pages at a time and is given an extremely superficial treatment throughout. I am genuinely at a loss to explain how such trash got published, let alone graced with a forward by Tom Wolfe and favorably reviewed in the New York Times. Considering the man's social connections and reputed charm, I guess the old saying is true- it's not what you know but_who_you know."
5,"""Faith with Funk!""","I am a firm believer that the message of God can be delivered through the gift of music, and Jon Gibson is a deliverer!! Although this is only my second CD from him, I have the"" Jesus Loves Ya"" CD also, there is certainly a style to this music that will make you want to jump, dance, shout, groove and just look up to the sky and say ""thank you Jesus!"" I am reminded of the style of Stevie Wonder with it's very soulful sound and was not surprised to read in the biography that Stevie was an influence, you can sure tell! I love Jon's style of singing from the very depths of his soul, I can feel it and want to grab a tambourine and groove/sing right along!! This is a must for anyone who loves funk, r&b and you don't have to be a believer to dig it!!! Although if you are... it is even better! My fav track has to be Someday Paradise, you will love it!!"
2,Not for anything more than Chix,"I needed a new set of Lobster Crackers after I bought a few 2 1/2 pounders. The crackers I had didn't open wide enough to crack the claws. I had to use a hammer on them (hard shelled). So I went shopping for new ones.These crackers are no better than the old ones I already had, they don't open wide enough. All they're good for is maybe cracking Chick Lobsters.. or maybe nuts. At least my old ones had a good weight to them.They feel like a very light-weight aluminum. The forks are light-weight as well. I have small hands and it's hard for me to get a good grasp on them. Absolutely not worth $21. Keep shopping."
2,Well I am not sure what kind of Truth?,"OK, true enough, there actually was some new material , having to do with Men In Black, that mostly originate with UK sightings, however most of the older books on the subject seemed to focus on the MIB sightings in the US. So there was actually some merit to the book. However if you are expecting the TRUTH to suddenly come out and smack you like a trout, forget it, there is still a lot of conjecture and little or no answers,(sorta of like the x files, the truth is out there but we are not gonna tell you now). In fact I did read the whole book expecting to be more enlightened and did go away with some new information, a more practicle title would be, Perhaps more information on MIB's that you havent read before! I am thinking about selling my copy and would have done it already, except for my love of books in general, sometimes it makes it hard for me to get rid of anything with the least bit of extra information.....then again perhaps i will get over it!!!"
2,A dry read...,"I was excited to read this book, until I started reading it. I had no idea MIB existed. I thought it was just a great movie idea. But, apparently there is some myth behind the MIB. This book is written after the first movie. It starts out with some great information a clear story about an UFO sighting and what happened afterwards to the witness. From there, they other stories are chalked full of information on names, dates, government offices, etc. So much so, I had to re-read several pages just to understand. It is very much a dry read with too much detail, so I feel. But, if you are big into UFOs, this might just be right up your alley."
3,Great band with technical shortcomings,"I have this DVD and I have seen Switchfoot live twice this year, once in a small setting and once in a stadium setting. I think the justified enthusiasm from the album The Beautiful Letdown has spilled over to this DVD, which is lacking in production quality and technical ability.In concert they can kind of make up for shortcoming this by 'turning the volume up to eleven', but when I can control the volume at home, I find that they are a bit unpolished live.I really don't think they are on par with, say, U2, in a live setting. People here are rating the album (5 stars) when they are reviewing the dvd (3 stars)."
5,switchfoot rox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,first if all switchfoot in my opinion is a great band. There is some great footage of switchfoot at Soma in san diego. All of the tracks are great!!!!!1
1,Sound Quality is terrible,"Worst DVD I own, reviewers say that the sound is not that good 'cause it's live. Listen to Goo goo dolls performing in the rain sounded 100 times better than this.Lacks energy and would trade it for anything else if I could."
3,Quite Acceptable Young Love Romantic Comedy,"I should think that this would rate highly with those for whom it is designed. One of a Long line of films about daughters of Very Important Men who seek Love and Romance in a world apart from that of their Fathers. Stars handle their roles competently, script is quite acceptable, supporting players do well with what they are given to work with, and the music provides a congenial background to the action. Someone not in the target audience is really not, competent to judge but,, I would guess that it does the film would gratify the younger crowd for whom it was made."
2,2 stars. if so,"I am a young person, but this movie just didn't tickle me in any way. I like Mandy Moore and sure she does a fine acting job for the kind of movie she does, but this movie wasn't the best.For one, it was totally unrealistic in NOT a good way. She is the presidents daughter, and because of that her freedom is limited. She gets a ride from a boy on a motorcycle, acts crazy, and the movie ends from there. The boy ends up being a secret agent who is protecting her on purpose. She has some drinks, gets drunk, exposes her bare ass, and the guy still falls in love with her.Obviously, it's a love story and the two do fall in love...The movie wasn't my favorite even though the male actor Matthew Goode looks good. Obviously, that doesn't make a movie good just because some actor is a hotty."
2,i tried to stay up as far as i could,"I adore Mandy Moore and think she's very talented but I agree with everyone who said this isn't her best performance. I patiently waited for something that would make me think differently of the movie, but I could actually predict what would happen. I didn't think there was any chemistry between Mandy and Matthew Goode -- they are both attractive on their own, but not together. I've always thought the world of European scenery, but not this time. Too obvious, too Americanized, not good."
1,Worst I've ever owned,"This thing really is awful. It's incredibly temperamental - it'll only play if the disk is absolutely pristine. The dvd's that I own seem to do well, but about 2 out of 3 disks I rent (or get through Netflix) refuse to play. The picture seizes up, or the sound keeps going while the screen turns black, or the whole thing just stops. Also, the remote control is ludicrous with its teeny tiny buttons, and all of them placed nonsensically - not at all user-friendly or intuitive.I know you get what you pay for, but the thing should at least work half the time, don't you think? Save your money, don't buy this machine."
4,I really like this CD,"Got to admit to not knowing a thing about Doyle, probably should and will certainly do some investigation now. This was a 'recommended' to me by Amazon so I gave a few tracks a listen. What a great CD. The songs are terrific and fun. Just plain old good rock and blues. I also really like the production. The sound fits the songs perfectly. If you like blues with a rock flavor that reflects where so much music came from you will enjoy this immensely."
2,Losing Feathers,"I love the color and texture of this comforter. However, as mentioned in previous reviews, it doesn't take long before the feathers start to come out. I thought for the price, I would try it and hope for the best. Unfortunately, my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown, it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out. This is not just an occasional feather either. It started out that way, but after a week or two, it is all the time. I especially notice it in the stitching areas. Disappointed."
1,forget where is the beef where is the duck down,this comforter set arrived to me in a huge box i was like oh yeah until i opened it there was more paper in the box than comforter the comforter bag was so small like it was a sheet set i cant believe that there is no down in the dame thing i wonder why they only want $35.00 for it because your getting a sheet set with 1 feather in it and called it a duck down comforter i read other reviews and they said that feathers are everywhere but i dont see how that is possible if it did not come with any feathers unless they some how lost the feathers during shipment lol or my duck was bald go figure
3,Great Color,"The Color is great!The weight is good, but it has ""lumpy"" rather than ""smooth"" appearance.Therefore,I only gave it a 3."
3,Feathers!,The comforter is comfortable and light which is nice. But the feathers coming out constantly which is rather annoying. I also bought before I read reviews listen to them!
2,Not as expected,"I bought this set based on a combination of the price and other reviews. I'll tell you now that it is not worth the money if you're looking for something lasting and/or comfortable. We used ours all of about a month and decided it just wasnt worth it. Feathers were everwhere, the feel was not soft and it was always too warm or too cold. I'm always for saving money but this set just isn't a good buy. On the plus side, it does look nice for maybe a guest bedroom and cleans well."
2,Review of Microsuede 4-piece White Duck Down Comforter Set,"This comforter set is okay if you don't mine wearing feathers all day long or seeing them all over your bed and room. I've on had the comforter for about 3 weeks and feathers are everywhere... even getting all over our clothes. My husband is sick of it and just said yesterday that he's planning to take it to the Salvation Army and just buy a comforter from Walmart. The style and look is nice, but the feathers coming through the fabric is insane!"
3,Okay for the price,"I ordered the set about two months ago. The red color easily comes off, so watch out for your white bedsheets and for anything you happen to wear to bed which is white. I assume a wash would fix this, alhough I am hesitant to put down into a regular wash, and of course dry cleaning would cost more than I paid for the set.The comforter is very warm, so I am not unhappy with it, but the feathers do poke sometimes and have a tendency to come out of the comforter. I am considering a duvet cover to possibly kill two birds with one stone (the color bleed problem as well as the poking)."
4,Soft and warm,The comforter is very very soft and holds heat very well. The only complaint I have is that the down feathers seem to be coming out but I'm sure this would be solved with a duvet cover as I don't have one.
3,Great For The Price,"I am in the process of selling my home, which means.. staging my home. I did not want to spend a lot of money but needed a new comforter set that was neutral. This was perfect! I read about the feathers coming out- purchased anyway and it's been about 6 weeks and haven't seen a feather yet. Granted- mine is for looks. We don't wash it weekly- we just pull it back at night and sleep with a quilt. My only concern and it is a big concern is that it's made in China. For now it will serve it's purpose and it's doing a great job of just that."
5,EDDY GRANT's a real genius!,"This guy's amazing. I've got all of his albums. Even my children love his music; the songs are incredibly contagious, and he writes the most powerful lyrics! He's touched on countless controversial topics (""Youth Tom Tom, War Party, Living On The Frontline etc.""), unlike most of today's artistes who illustrate the morally destructive 'sex sells' campaign. Eventually, one tires of this...but EDDY GRANT's material is both refreshing and revolutionary. Music to change the world.GRANT's albums each has something unique; something that everyone of us can identify with. Most of today's artistes are expendible; they make disposable music, and all sing about the same thing. EDDY GRANT's albums to me are a rare reminder that there are artistes who have something powerful to say.A MUST HAVE! If you have 5 classic albums in your home LET ""EDDY GRANT- GREATEST HITS COLLECTION"" BE ONE!"
2,Pinewood Derby Car Stand,"The stand is ok, but a word of caution that is not visible from the picture provided. The stand requires that you put two screws in the bottom of your derby car that slide/attach into the metal semi-circle bracket. That metal semi-circle bracket attaches to the wooden base using a brass push pin.All in all, this will work, but not what I was looking for. The push pin means that the bracket rotates on its own. Also, my son likes to take his car out to show people, this is difficult using this stand."
2,Nice To Have On File,"Dr Hindson's book is a good book to keep on file so that you can understand what other believe believe when it comes to the end times. He like many others however miss many key verses in the bible as well as greek words used to inturpret things to give us understanding. Tribulation as mentioned in Matt 24 and throughout the gospels as well as in many of Paul's letters means Thlipsis, this meaning time of ""Great"" persecution, & trouble.I did enjoy reading this book and do recommend it to those who hold to other rapture beliefs.Like Paul we must walk upright and keep our focus on Christ, not allowing ourselves to fall away from the truth of God."
4,An African Adventure,"The Red Eye FeverElise DallemagneThis is a well-crafted, true-life adventure story. Read it and be transported to the Belgian Congo in the 1950's, where a nice young American girl gets herself invited to go crocodile hunting. Although she has never killed an animal in her life, she finds herself having to pull the trigger on a huge crocodile that has terrorized the region for years. The story is fresh and convincing because it was written from notes taken at the time. The accompanying photographs, which the author almost lost, are priceless records of the country and the people."
5,This disc jams!,Listening to Liquid Soul live is the best audio experience I've ever had; this and their other two discs are the next best thing. Pure audio ecstasy!
2,Rehashed themes lacking inspiration,"How sad to see the intelligence of Thom Jones' first two collections give way to vulgarity and cliche. His trademark vitality seems strained and insincere, as if overdone profanity and loads of exclamation points were sufficient to generate that earlier level of raw energy. Perhaps he should quit reading his rave reviews and again write from deep down inside. For such a talented author, a disappointing volume."
5,Must have for Mental Health Case Managers,"This excellent, clearly written and incredibly useful book is a must have for any Adult Community Mental Health Service dealing with individuals who have Borderline Personality Disorder. It provides evidence-based, clear, ethical, and highly effective advice that should enable medical staff, and case managers to take control of their relationships with patients and understand what tends to derail these relationships. Minimize harmful hospital admissions, reduce risk, and help promote a more healthy way of engaging with these troubled individuals. A must have."
4,louise brooks fans,"Thisn is the first movie Brooks made in Europe, and is the standard from which she worked. It's a horrific ending for a character who deteriorates through the entire movie, from happy-go-lucky kept woman to prostitute carved up by The Ripper. Use the ORCHESTRAL sound track, the other two are annoying."
3,Another one bites the dust! Not durable enough...........,"My boston terrier tore it open within a few days. On the positive not it has two squeakers and a voice box! She really loved it, but it was not strong enough :-("
4,Tai Chi novice,"Book is simple and easy. Straight forward dialog and diagrams, is is good for a beginner or a person with a casual interest in Tai Chi."
2,You would think...,"You would think that an adapter from the manufacturer would always work, but this one only works in the telephoto range. At wide angles, the tube appears in the frame. Maybe it's only intended to be used with telephoto attachments, but it definitely falls short for filters."
5,"It is great history book, great games of the great master.",It is great history book about the superb master of go. It is huge collection of commented games of the master. One of the best go books I ever read.
4,A spare encounter with the drama of war,"The author of The Last Parade reenters a war that has been continually rewritten over the years as a sounding board for fashionable morality. His achievement lies in his ability to slip under the radar screen of revisionists and romanticists alike to emerge with an economical tale grounded in human truth. The Last Parade is a vivid dramatization that asks the reader for a belief made possible only by one's shell-shocked exposure to the 20th century. Indeed, this is a book for the present age, as no other age has been quite prepared for it."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I received advanced mailing for this book and was looking forward to what was billed as the ultimate war story amid the chaos of war, impossible to put down. I found the book to be boring. The characters were shallow, the battle descriptions lacking in realism. The story didn't grip me emotionally, and the ending was predictable. I am being generous in giving the book two stars....."
4,I can't Complain,"I can't complain, this series has excellent information for just couple bucks. Thanks to some of the ideas I got from this set, I've multiplied my business's revenue. Don't wait, You better go out there and get it Now! Before Your competition get's it, and uses it against You. I Guarantee you won't regret the purchase, I know I haven't."
5,The Robin Williams of Books,"A great book full of laughs and comedy. You want to keep seeing what zany situations turn up at the Walter Melon Elementary school. The zany elements make you remember your third grade year and compare it to this book. I liked it because it had a lot of humor, and I could DEFINITELY relat this book to my third grade class."
5,The Perfect Addition,"This is a great set of track for the system that just needs a little something. The half track makes it all come together. This is a must buy. If you know a child has this set, and don't want to duplicate, get this. It's great for Dad's too."
5,OMG! Life changing!,"This book was so instrumental in healing from my own past abuse in many forms. I'm so thankful for the author and his wife for the work that they've put into it. Their heart for the broken, bitter, hurt souls of the world beats more fervently on every page. Their understanding and validation goes a long way. Amazing!"
4,Tough transcendental sledding,"Rahner's ""Foundations"" is a long, bumpy, difficult ride. The concepts are brilliant and challenging. They undoubtedly illuminate the faith of Christians and profoundly portray Catholicism. Rahner's mode of expression, however, is dense and difficult...."
3,Dry,"Great information, but it is very dry. I am a guitar teacher and tried to use this to supplement a lesson, but the students lost interest very quickly."
1,The worst,This is the worst thing that spent money on ever. It is just like your footwear with a vibrating motor inside. It is not designed prosessionally and the vibration is annoying. The batteries are not included and one needs special care to install the batteries that may damge the whole system. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,Waste of money :(,"I bought these slippers hoping to finally walk around my home comfortably. Boy was I wrong the memory foam is super thin, one of my slippers didnt work, doesnt massage when walking, going up and down stairs is a challenge you can actually feel the motor on your feet because the memory foam is soo thin. Dont buy you've been warned."
3,less than satisfied,"I bought these for my boyfriend and was so embarrassed when he opened them, put them on, and the right one had some kind of short in the massage feature. Not only that, but it doesn't turn off, so if he just wears them as slippers, occassionally his foot starts buzzing.He says they're comfortable though, and that he'll still use them just as slippers, hence the 3 stars instead of none."
2,Bought mine at Thrift Shop for $4.00,Priced about right at $4.00.... it is what it is.... I wouldn't expect miracles at $40 either......... BUT it is much better than doing it myself at the end of a hard day.
2,"Worked well, but broke early on","I bought this for my mom and it worked well originally. The massgae action is nice and soothing, and the heat element is great for those whose feet get cold, like the elderly.The problem was that the right side heating went out after about 3 weeks of light use. Still works for the massage part but no heat on one side."
1,Cheap Junk - burned out in 1 hour,"The motor burned out on this unit after less than an hour of use. I'm a 195 lb. man, and the weight of my feet was just too much for the unit to handle. I tried using the massager on just one foot at a time, as other users had recommended, but even this proved too great a burden for the machine to bear. The ball bearings on the massage plates are made of plastic, rather than steel. The drive mechanism is grossly underpowered, and simply not robust enough for its intended use. The motor slowed, then stopped altogether. It's ridiculous that anyone could actually charge money for this.We bought a Medirub after returning this. It costs much more, about $175, but it is still working years later, and it's an amazingly powerful and solid product. Another, and less costly alternative is the roller and porcupine ball, for about $12. It's portable, and handy when you're traveling. Both are available on Amazon. Whatever you do, AVOID THIS."
2,"Loved it, but it broke","I followed the instructions and didn't overuse it. The motor went after 2 months. I miss it so much that I am considering getting another one, even though I never got my money back for the first one."
5,Perfect for tired feet.,"I gave this HoMedics foot messager to my grand-daughter for Christmas. She is away at college where she attends classes and is on her feet a better part of the day in science labs. Her feet are ""barking"" by the end of each day. She says the foot massager gives her feet just the right amount of stimulization which enables her to relax and fall asleep."
3,Foot Pleaser? Maybe!,"I like this machine...it does help the foot relax and certainly feels good. I was disappointed that I bought used without warranty as the right heat went out a week after I got it. There's nothing deep about the massage, so I felt somewhat mislead by other reviews. It's hard to relax your foot in use because the pressure on the device really causes drag. One rec is to wear socks when using which does help. Another negative is the turning wheels push your feet off the device so it's hard to keep them in one place, esp the place that needs massage...it's disappointing. Having sides or something to keep the foot in place would be helpful. But it does help more than not."
1,junk,I turned it on and after about 15 minutes I smelled a burning motor and then it died wow those chinese are awesome
2,"Works, but not very Satisfying",If I was in a store and tried it out I would not have given it a second thought.
2,foot massager ..too fast..SHIATSU,Foot massager too heavy / fast.. use a shorter time period. I use more frequently
3,Good But Broke After 2-3 Months,"The massage felt good. Ticklish at first, but you get use to it. Heating wasn't very warm at all. The motor broke after 2-3 months of use. At $35, I don't know if it's worth it to send it back to Manufacturer to get it fix."
1,"Not soothing, like walking on marbles, very little warmth!",I was very disappointed in this massager. The rotating massagers feel like you are walking on marbles. The massaging pads are not soothing to the feet at all. The instructions say to allow a few moments for the infrared heat to warm up. After 20 minutes I was still waiting. The infrared heat was barely warm. I expected more of the product. It does not live up to the Homedics company reputation and it is twice the price of the other foot massagers. Don't buy this unit.
4,I love Andrea Pickens,I will buy anything Andrea Pickens writes. If you love regency era and strong female characters you will love all her books.
2,funny stuff,"the picture of the guys on the back of the liners will make you laugh. wow stanley clarke is weird looking. i don't listen to this much but there is a really sweet synth solo by pat metheny somewhere, i think it's on track two. the album kinda sucks tho."
5,I've read a lot of books and this one is good,"I don't like to write reviews, usually, but I'm breaking the rule because this is such a great trilogy and deserves its five stars, not its two or three from .... These books have depth and the author writes above average and a true book of fiction will ferret you out of your world and into theirs and this one does enjoyably."
2,Her Journey,"Sookan is a girl from Seoul, Korea and she is taking a journey from her home land to New York City to go to college. She&#65533;s making friends but has a hard time getting her work done. As she struggles with her family back home and her friends and school work in America she learns a lot about herself and the differences that there are between America and Korea. I thought that this book was pretty good, the thing I liked the most about this book was that she tried to do everything she could to get everything done, the thing that I disliked the most was there wasn&#65533;t any action this was just a calm story that just kept talking about the same thing over and over again. She tried her best and still managed to be in touch with her family and still keep up her school work. Look for Gathering of Pearls to read the ending of this book."
2,discs not in order--not well labeled,I ordered this after watching the series on TV. Was disappointed that the last disc ends on a question mark--(episodes missing?) And the discs are poorly labeled so as to be impossible to put them in order. Very disappointing.
2,damaged disc,"I was able to watch so far 3 discs, out of which one is completely damaged.It also took me long time to put all the discs in order. There are no identifying labels."
5,Brilliant fun for all ages,"I recieved my ""Penny and Polo"" books a few days back and I think they're really fun. Jay Sopp has created an original, artistic, and most of all HILARIOUS set of books with the Penny and Polo series. The book advertises- ""put on your best British accent and read Penny and Polo to your kids"", and that's sure to be a ton of fun for parents and kids alike with the brilliant and hilarious dialogue. The book has it all- classic adventure, tons of cheeky comedy, and beautiful traditionally-painted illustrations also by Mr. Sopp. Highly recommended!"
4,(#14) One of my top 3 of the series.,This was the last book in the series. I have only given 4 stars to 2 or 3 of the books in this series. This one might be my 2nd favorite story out of the 14. Very good characters. Good plot with some suspence. None of these books are filled with much sex. They are just a nice romance with a little turmoil along the way. All are pretty predictable but I enjoyed everyone of them. I loved her writing of the characters that would show up throughout the series. You felt like you knew some of these people.
4,A great story of overcoming cultural and political barriers.,"At first, this book was hard to get into, but by the end, it became one of the best books I had ever read.This book is a classic example of how people can overcome political and cultural barriers through the most difficult of times."
3,Still waiting,"I kept waiting, and waiting for something interesting, poignant, novel, absorbing, anything to arise in the narrative. But it never did. I started skimming about halfway thru, lots and lots of descriptive passages, easy to just glide on by, nothing, nothing, nothing. Then it was over. Back to non-fiction."
3,Chipped.,"A little disappointed. I do not plan to return this item, but there is a small chip in the glaze. Not what one would suspect in ordering a ""new"" item."
5,Beautiful Watch...,This watch is absolutely beautiful..My husband is sooo happy with it..Definately worth the money..
2,not to good,"Disc seemed to be of poor quality, very dark and blurry. Was received in a timely fashion. I would find it hard to make another purchase from that vendor."
4,"Cute, Cute, Cute!","These shoes look fabulous and are great for embracing both the patent leather and the ballet flat trends. The pop of red spices up your whole outfit. The only negative is that they are not the most comfortable shoes in the world. But I slipped some insoles in mine and that made them ok. Since they are real leather and not plastic, I am guessing they will get more comfortable with time, but you may still want to add some cushion in the bottom."
3,Short battery life,"I have bought several of these from our local pet store. Our cats love to chase the red dot - the brighter the better. Unfortunately, it doesn't take very many uses before the light starts to dim. For a while it will seem to dim at random, sometimes becoming brighter when shaken or whacked against the side of the hand - but eventually dying out entirely.A new pair of batteries brings it back to life, but the frequency with which the batteries have to be replaced is not easy on the earth or the wallet. And I question the quality of the laser pointer if shaking it brings it back to life for a while - poor battery connection? Poor wiring? My cats need a laser pointer that isn't such an energy hog."
2,American.........,Kerrygold butter is made in the United States under licence. There is a difference between the butters from each side of the Atlantic.
1,"Buy ""Anthology""! Save Your Money! Turn Back!","As MCA continues it's ""Millenium"" series,a collection of sub-standard,best of,retreads. Suddenly they loooove Oingo Boingo again. This collection is so [bad] and obvious,it totally sweeps over some of their best known works,as well as fan faves! No ""Sweat""? Where is ""No Spill Blood""? No sign of ""Nothing Bad Ever Happens""? Even ""Gratitude"" gets left in the dust.Not even a semi-rare bone,like the studio version of ""Goodbye Goodbye""? At the very least,you would think,they would've collected the singles,or the title cuts:""Good For Your Soul"",anybody? If you want to sample the glory that Is/Was/Will Be: Oingo Boingo....buy the ""Anthology"" release. It's time to tell MCA they've released too many ""Not-So-Best-Of"" packages.If they want to lure hardcore Boingoloids,release the unreleased tracks. Until then,don't call us..."
3,A decent overview,The book is an adequate overview of President Bush's foreign policy through the first three years of his office. But it does not do justice to the more intelectually challenging questions of the administration's foreign policy such as why exactly did America go to war in Iraq and what kind of role are the neo-conservatives playing in the administration.
2,Too Small and Overpriced,"I measured our old hamper, and this hamper was supposed to be larger than our current one. However, the measures listed in the product description (30"" x 21"" x 13"") are for the metal frame; the fabric bag itself is approximately 25"" x 12.25"" x 12.25"", making this hamper smaller than our current one. I will have to return it.The fabric looks great in the picture, like it is thick and opaque, but in person it looks thin and I can see lots of light through it. The metal frame looks silvery in the picture, but it is actually not even a ""pewter"" as the product description says - it is a very dark gray.I actually like the hamper's style, but for us it is too small and way too pricey (we paid $79.99) for what it is.I hope this post helps others make an informed decision!"
1,Not worth it,"The scope of teasing the brain with chalenging games is not so difficult to make entertaining. Towards this end I believe they faiiled. It is not up-to-date, not challenging and very poor graphics"
4,"So realistic, but a few flaws","These days, it seems as if there are few Catholic novels around. I found Conceived Without Sin to be a great book! The characters are so realistic. They grow and change throughout the book, but they're still the same lovable people in the end. The way they think and talk, and how they live their faith is so familiar to me, as I'm sure it is to many Catholics. Their spiritual and worldly battles are what so many people go through! What I didn't like about the book is the number of characters. There are so many! It was difficult at times to remember who was who. All in all, though, I loved this book! I definitely recommend it!"
3,The Sophomore jinx hits MacFarlane,"Bud MacFarlane's first book, Pierced By a Sword, was a page turner that showed that truly informative, exiciting, religious-based books could be written. As a follow-up, Conceived Without Sin lacks the drama and intensity of the original. The plot is somewhat weak, the characters uninspiring and neurotic, and the ending unsatisfying. Some of the subplots (and especially the Dostoevsky-like discussions) are quite good, but overall I suggest you read the 1st book and wait a few months until MacFarlane's 3rd book hits the racks."
3,"Nice idea, but not so good execution..","This is the 3rd LT album I have. In short, it lacks connection between lyrics and music. Only a few Prog Rock bands before managed to came closer to a rock opera style. Some pieces (mostly musical) are not so bad. Lyrics are interesting, but I don't see how non Russian speakers will keep following 2CD's. My suggestion for LT is to listen to Solaris besides Stravinsky and ELP. Perhaps combining some Russian/Slavic folk elements would be more interesting."
2,Sucks,"It does what it says, but it is so so slow even using windows 98 and I have a newer iMac G5 1.8 GHz with 768MB of Ram."
2,I hate to be the lone naysayer but...,"This book must be compared to Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea. In fact, it's hard to avoid the comparison: two ships in deep water, expensive and litigious salvage attempts, new technologies, etc. However, Ship of Gold is a far better book, with a more compelling protagonist, and far greater technological problems to overcome. I have recommended Ship of Gold to my management team so that they can see how one individual was able to harness the brains and money of a many to accomplish his goals. While the Republic is well-written, it seems to be a puff piece by comparison, with idolizing statements about the two main characters. I cannot recommend it, at least in the company of Ship of Gold."
3,Very Interesting Concepts,"Okay, I'll admit right up front - I bought this book because Dr. Marinkovich is my personal physician. While he and I do not see eye to eye on all matters of religion and bible interpretation, I do find his approach refreshing in this day and age of corporate America. His thoughtfulness and urging for all of us to remember that there is a higher power in your life than the Board of Directors and CEO is a huge point that has been long overlooked. It has changed how I handle things at work - sort of a ""WWJD"" for the business world!"
3,controversial:,"The book is beautifully written, it inspires you and gives you hope. The way the words and sentences are placed gets your attention, and strikes your negative thoughts.The bad thing is: the images. Why use beautiful women? All the women in the book are thin like angels. Their bodies are perfect. I know that the human should be treated holistically, body and soul, but what is the message being sent to a girl that is not so closed to the ideal body? it can awake negative feelings and may link the words with a perfect body. its like giving the message that happiness is for beautiful thin girls.However when you need an inspirational boost its nevertheless a very good book.it reminds you some important aspects that most of us forget very easily and get depressed."
2,Book came with binding falling apart,I received the book with the pages falling out and binding falling apart. The book appears to be very worn.I love this book and find the pictures inspiring. I have had another copy for about ten years now and the book suites me at each stage I have gone through. I highly recommend the book.
4,Nice,"Go buy this album and support our Canadian artists! I did and I'm impressed. The music's very folksy and Beatles-y...the type of stuff I can picture being played in some smokey little bar in a small Canadian town. Despite so, I actually like this album. If you're thinking about buying the album for the 3 or 4 singles, definitely do it...your in for a treat with the rest of the album."
1,Take Me for a RIDE ... big time,"I really liked the first one. I got it in the Street Biker set, and it was really the best flick in the box set. Based on that experience, I happily threw down the clams for this one. In short ... if you like sport bike movies, don't buy this one. If you like some lame motorcross stuff on sand dunes and potato guns being shot at a trailer, by all means go and get it. It has about 1/4 sport bike tricks, and the rest is just lame stuff plus some girl shots. I was very disappointed. If I could get my money back, I would. But since its opened, the best source of revenge around is a can of lighter fluid and a match ... Never fear though, I will burn it in my grill. Safety first!"
1,A 16-year-old reader,"Labor room companions can use this book as a childbirth class refresher course during the nine month and as a bedside manual that clearly spells out ""what to do when."" Jones, a leading childbirth educator, covers every potentially troublesome situation that may arise. A must-have book, if only for the emergancy delivery instructions."
1,STILL WAITING,"Purchased CD in November. It has not arrived. What & Who, will the Seller Blame it on.Let's see if the Seller will accomodate me, for,,,, being paid on time,,,,,, but I have not received my CD on time. Funny how that works,,,,,, they get paid,,,, for doing ,,,,, NOTHING!!!"
1,Transaction isn't as pretty as the picture,"I bought the poster it had several kinks, and looked like it was copied on a copier, they sent out a replacement a few weeks later....I think after about a month I got the poster I needed. I paid more for shipping on 2 nearly weightless posters than I did the posters...so that was upsetting paying over $16 for postage on 2 posters."
3,Disappointing,I found this to be only an average performance. Edita Gruberova was very long in the tooth for this role. She looked old and the voice left something to be desired; not always on pitch and just tired. The rest of the cast was just adequate.
2,bare bones production with a few moments of great singing,"If you're looking for operatic eye candy as far as sets and costumes go, this production is not for you. You could pack the sets in a small mini-van and take them on tour. But it's the singing that counts and sometimes Gruberova delivers and sometimes she doesn't. The sad thing is Bellini wrote such beautiful music for this opera and it deserves to be heard by a seasoned cast. This is not the cast. The audience clearly adores Gruberova and she steps out of character to acknowledge their adulation every chance she gets. Bros picks up steam as the performance moves along but the Barcelona Opera chorus evidently had other things on its mind. Watching them in the background shows most of them uninvolved with the proceedings. It's not a dreadful performance but Puritani deserves better treatment. Until another production comes along, this one barely suffices."
3,"Ok, but not great. Wouldn't recommend.","A quick read that held my attention fairly well, but nothing I'd recommend to others. It reminded me of a darker, less likeable version of Dodie Smith's, ""I Capture the Castle,"" which I did really enjoy as compared to this book. There are a few likeable characters, but they aren't as well developed as they could have been. Would have liked to have known more about the housekeeper, groundskeeper and father."
3,Interesting read.,"A good book. I enjoyed reading it. The interesting thing was I would almost classify it as chick-lit maybe and had I of known the entire story I would've probably never read it. I found myself really wanting to know the outcome of Emilie's story though. Sometimes a little annoying with her inability to understand the world around her, but perhaps that was just simply because of the way she was brought up. I enjoyed the read."
3,A romance from Provence in the XXth century,"I like Marseillian story and South of France ambiance.I didn't like morality and how the movie endsSome points of view, mainly explained are really critical."
5,Loves it!,To the user who gave the 1-star revue...you are supposed to use the Anti-bac if you have acne (it's now called medi-bac). The clearing skin wash is for people with normal skin conditions. The seller should not be punished with a bad review just because the product you chose was wrong.
3,Strength of some products,"The products were reccommended to me by a friend and I have been using most of the products in the line for more than six months, but I think the % of Salicylic Acid especially in the cleansing wash is too low for me. when I get a 5% Salicylic Acid peel at the spa it cleares up my acne for at least six weeks, these product are pretty expensive, I really could do with better results. I reccommend that there be different strength of Salicylic Acid in some products like the Overnight Cream, the Cleanser and the Toner. The product with the strongest Salicylic Acid that I have seen is the Mattifier and this has only 2%. I appreciate the fact there has not been any artificial ingredients in these product but I think the product are too mild in some instances for someone with frequent breakout like mine."
5,Keeping my skin good.,I been using this for years and of cos i need it to be cheaper. The only way is to buy it more at a more economical price. That is why this 250ml size is great!
2,No pump included!,Picture shows a pump on the bottle (which is the only reason I ordered it online) and it didn't come with one! I could've gone to the store to get this! Disappointed!!!
2,"Very disappointed with these ""candles""","I wanted to put candles in all my windows for the Christmas season. I ordered these thinking, because of the price, I'd be getting a solid well-lighted candle. Not so. While the ad says they are ""pewter"" it is nothing more than silver colored cheap, lightweight plastic. The bulb glows more of a dark yellow/orange and doesn't look at all like a candle flame. The light is very dim. My neighbor has Walmart candles in her windows and they glow very bright. I called her and asked her to look out the window to see how mine looked and she said from across the street it was very dim. I returned them."
4,My father in law loves them,"I purchased them for our house, but my husband thought the lights were too orange/yellow. I explained what he was looking for was hard to find and the reviews on Amazon let me know what to expect. We argued about them and my father-in-law settled the debate by offering to place them in his windows. They look good!"
3,"Product as described, except one out of four arrived with a defective electrical connection.","The company needs better quality control. Because these were bought for stage props, there was not sufficient time to return the item, we had to fix it ourselves."
5,Looks great,"This candle is the perfect style for my old Maine cape home. the best part is that you don't need to plug them in, they go on and off at the right times and they look great in my windows"
3,Great Solution,"These candles work well and reduce the hassles of wired lights and extension cords, fit well on 2"" wide window sill, and the two C cells make a nice ballast so they don't fall over easily. Lights are yellow to orange and not nearly as bright as the corded lights. The base is plastic. They don't look nearly as realistic in person as they do in the on-line photos. I have one or two where the photo cell does not seem to work as well flicker mode. But for $8 bucks each they're great. This review might get scrapped but I bought 16 of these at batteryoperatedcandles.net for about $8 each. They arrived 3-4 days after I ordered them."
4,Great window candle,"These are lovely - yes, they are definitely more orange than a real candle, but they actually look very nice and I'd rather take a warm (more orange) glow than a cold white light that some others have. I have them set on the flicker function, which produces a very realistic flickering that is also nicely visible from the outside. They turn out automatically once it gets dark, and turn themselves off in the morning. I can't say anything about how long the batteries last - we've only had them for 3 weeks, but so far they are working great.Love them, and will definitely get some more!"
5,Love This CD!,"I know Julia Sarr through a friend and stayed with her in Paris for a short while. She is as wonderful a person on the outside as she is on the inside - and her voice is pure magic! Who knew that Senegalese rythym could blend so well with Flamenco guitar? It's a great work by two wonderful and talented people, and my hat goes off to them!"
3,Rock Lyrics Trivia,The book is a good idea for old rock and roll fans but some of the questions are really obscure.
4,not a biography,"How fabulous to be the first reviewer just because I've gone with the European version! You can see over a thousand reviews on the same book if you spell memoires with only one 'e'. I liked this book very much but I was deceived into thinking it was a biography, when of course it's pure fiction. I think a lot of its success comes from that deception."
4,Cilla goes multimedia !,"Have to give this CD a good rating for the fact that it does have a novelty factor...being a bonus interactive CD-ROM for your PC which contains details about Cilla: The Singer !Down-sides unoriginal artwork and just the usual hits all previously available but stunning none the less: Love of the loved / Anyone who had a heart / You're my world (il mio mondo) / It's for you / You've lost that lovin' feeling / I've been wrong before / Love's just a broken heart / Alfie / Don't answer me / A fool am I (dimmelo parlami) / What good am I / I only live to love you / Step inside love / Where is tomorrow / Surround yourself with sorrow / Conversations / If I thought you'd ever change your mind / Something tells me (something's gonna happen tonight) / Baby, we can't go wrong"
2,Not special at all,"I've read better poetry in high school literary magazines. There is nothing special about this poetry, and the art is ok, but this is just typical angsty teen poetry. If you want some good samplings of outstanding poetry and art written by teenagers read Scholastic's You are Here, This is Now instead. It's much longer and written 10 times better."
3,To easy to be ruined,"This book has an interactive feature that asks the user to pull the tabs to make the characters in the book slide back and forth, but the tabs are made of soft cardboard and are way too easy to bend and eventually break - then the fun is gone once the tabs are gone!The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is that my 20 month old daughter loved it so much, that she still wanted to read it even with the tabs all broken. So I (maybe stupidly) bought her a second one, that sadly to say, I don't think will last as long as the first one did!!This would be a great book if the interactive features were made of a more sturdy material."
1,Don't waste your money,Standard Dora book but a complicated pull system that had both tabs ruined 5 MINUTES after the book was used by a kid. They spent all their time figuring some fancy pull tab sytem that is 3d - and forgot that KIDS use the book. And their precise directions and badly designed system means we now have a book which doesn't work.
3,OLDIE BUT GOODIE,THIS IS AN OLDER BOOK SO YOU MIGHT NOT ALWAYS FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SINCE PLANTS HAVE CAME ALONG WAY IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. BUT THE BARE BONES ARE GOOD AND YOU CAN SOMETIMES GET DIFFERENT IDEAS FROM IT BECAUSE OF ITS AGE. A GOOD BUY IF YOU BUY IT USED AT A CHEAP PRICE.
5,Foxfire 2,"Really enjoy this book. Takes me back to living in Bristol, VA - which I miss very much. The old ways are forgotten as the future rushes us into technology, work, and ways away from the land."
2,gun case,"gun case was affordable, fits an AR-15 or Tactical shotgun perfectly{no scope}. Has tough exterior and smooth interior plus shoulder carry strap. I use Bore Store treated sock on weapon which also fits in case. Buy It!"
3,Who is this show FOR?!,"I watched this on a whim, cause the write-up made it seem like it may be some light-hearted story along the lines of My Neighbor Totoro, and it is...if Totoro was all about tits. The story material is aimed straight at younger females as far as I can tell. But the constant priority given to boob-meat and risque situations would seem to be aimed squarely at the lonely male 20 sumthins. I guess only a select few anime creators can (or even want) to bypass their cultures obsessive need to be perverted when making shows anymore. Honestly I'm not sure why they even bother with it, their fans would make and sell their own home brew porn of the characters within minutes anyway.Rambling aside: This is a magical girly story about finding yourself and stuff that is great for kids who need a little introspection and also to feel funny in their peepee place."
4,"Some real ""gems"" inside this book","Overall, the book is a bit dry at times, but if you can read, knowing that you will stumble upon a real diamond from time to time, it's a book well worth reading."
5,Familiar and comfortable as if it were yesterday,Its been 20 or so years and on wish list a long time and FINALLY I ordered a replacement to my long lost casette. Just amazing music that I still love even though I have moved past that time in my life.
1,When you have a daughter,"To all those men and boys who think this game is fun, would you promise to play this game with your daughter? Do you think it respects women as people and not as objects? This game makes me want to spit."
5,HO Deer,They arrived in a timely manner. Look beautiful!!!! Highly recommend company - they stand behind their products.
4,I've found this book to be the ideal reference for transitioning to a superscalar system from an in-order machine,"My experience in embedded system prepared me for the definition and architecture of CPUs, MPUs. DSPs, and DPUs. The experience didn't prepare me for the dynamic reordering found in out-of-order machines. This book led me to understanding the reason why instructions are already executed while debugging an application. I recommend this book for learning the nuances of superscalar machines."
5,Great Tina and Ike cd!!!,"I really belive that this one is the best cd from Tina and Ike Turner. Great songs from Ike, great covers but most of all great vocals from the queen of Rock n Roll!!!"
5,This Is Not The Same Cd,For anybody that has the orginal alumb than don't buy this one cause it's not the same alumb on cd it's one that you can find at Wal-Mart. I love the group i just wished it was the one that i was looking for.Rondall Banks
1,Why waste your money,"The group was great. But this CD has only ten tracks. Better compilations of their catalog are out there. Get this if you are indeed a cheapskate and only half heartedly like their sound. Look for the long version of ""Crimson and Clover"" now available on ""Cellophane Symphony"" and then get the more complete TJ & the Shondells ""Anthology"""
1,The Best of Tommy James and the Shondells,"Terrible recording. Only recorded one side of the stereo track thus leaving out half the music, like the beautiful acoustic guitar work on Crystal Blue Persuasion. Returned this for refund."
2,You get what you pay for....,"You get what you pay for....I agree with the first reviewer. There are plently of great nature videos on Amazon.com. Check out ""Hawaiian Zen"" for example, if you like waterfalls and waves. Peaceful, Beautiful & Tranquility- its worth the price."
3,"Good book, could've been better","This is without a doubt THE definitive biography of James Monroe, but, unfortunately, it was not written with the same aplomb as McCullough's John Adams or Joseph Ellis' book on Thomas Jefferson (American Sphinx). I agree with some of the other reviewers who said the book is long on detail, but short on analysis. Still, I am glad I read it and feel that I learned a lot about Monroe. I just wouldn't classify it as a great biography. Just the best one available about James Monroe."
3,Standard historical biography,"This book was tedious to read and didn't contain as much information as books like Ketcham's James Madison or McCullough's Truman.Ammon did a good job of listing the activities in which James Monroe partook but I feel he gave me little in the way of any new understanding of them. The exceptions would be Ammon's description of James Monroe's diplomatic service to France during George Washington's administration. Ammon's description provided new insight to about this time period that I had not previously understood. I also liked his portrayals of the friendships he had with his contemporaries in particular Madison, John Quincy Adams and Lafeyette.Other than that, I felt the book a little dull."
1,james monroe,A very tedious read. were it not for my decision to read a bio on every president i would have ditched it months ago.
2,Print too small,"Ordered in black, returned item. Poor quality vinyl cover with visible seams. Print is also very small, too small for young reader. Nice concordance in back, and words of Christ in red."
5,I AM THE DOOR,"This book is a wonderful uplifting read all the way through. When I need some inspiration, I open up to any page for guidance. I had a copy of this book sent to a friend and it helped her past some rough times. I Am the Door helps to pull you out of the mundane and into hope and possibility."
2,Doesn't do anything,Read the literature. High Omega 3 levels correlate with but don't cause healthier hearts. Downing supplements doesn't solve the problem.
2,Not What I expected,"This is a cute book, but it's more like a flip-back desk calendar with suggestions on how to keep ""romance"" on your mind, than a book giving you 101 ideas on how to romance. I was expecting something along the lines of ""101 Nights of Greeeeat Sex"" (a great book that I highly recommend)."
1,Worst movie EVER!,"This is by far the worst movie ever, and mentioning the worst gay movie I have ever seen. It carries not substace whatsoever, the main character is boring and predictable. If you want to see a great gay movie BIG EDEN is the movie to watch"
5,China Wok,"I am most pleased with my recent purchase. The wok is small, which is what I wanted, but large enough to cook all two can eat. It is very substantial and holds heat well. I would definitely purchase again."
3,wok worked almost 1 year~,"I bought this wok for my daughter Christmas of 2011. For the first 9 months it worked very well (no sticking) and cooked vegeatables, soups, etc very well. Gradually, the bottom of the pan started to chip away and rust and food would stick slightly. As of November of 2012 I had to through it out because it was simply unusable. On the upside, I did like the small size of this wok because its perfect for an apartment size stove."
5,How Romans Built,"When taken together as a collection, Macaulay's books, from Castle and Cathedral and Pyramid, Mill, Unbuilding, Mosque, and most definitely this one, City, create what is probably the most readable, retainable, and approachable exploration of the story of architecture that's out there. These books, each highlighting an era and a project, are all a lot of fun to look at, read, and think about, and in this volume, City, the foundation and construction of a Roman population center is detailed. From the explanation for why the Romans built cities from scratch, to the selection and preparation of the site, to the actual erection of a brand new city, Macaulay leaves nothing unexplored or unexplained. These books are as enjoyable for adults as they are for children, and are truly classics of our time."
5,See how Romans built an Empire....,"A book, for children and adults, shows us how a Roman city was built, from the ground up. First they make a plan, deciding on how many people will live in the city, where the forums will go, the roads, the walls, the markets, theater, amphitheater and temples. They bring the stone to make the walls and aqueducts. We see how people live in the city, as the book explores the homes, businesses, public spaces and sewer system. We get to see the final, complete, form of the city, full of busy streets, crowded markets, happy homes and tall walls."
3,Nice to Read,BROTHER WORD is a good story with a relavant topic. Its good to read stories by men that have a little emotinal depth. Chance was written with a believeable character. There could have been more description and definitely a little more romantic chemistry thing going on but it was still a good nice story to read that held me till the end. Healing is a dynamic topic in our modern society and worthy of more attention then we give it. It was handled in a realistic way. Nice Work!
3,Some Details You Might Not Know,"I had a copy of this book 20 or so years ago and got Chuck Traynor to autograph it for me, this via a friend who was in the gun business with him.I was told that the book was very accurate, including the part about Sammy Davis, Jr., who called Chuck when the book was published and wanted to sue LL. They discussed the matter and decided that any such suit would only give more publicity to the book and increase sales, so no suit was filed. The book was never a big seller, so obviously they made the correct choice.Although Traynor was into smuggling marajuana and other criminal enterprises he was not convicted of anything, at least not when I knew of him in the early 80's so he was able to buy and sell fully automatic firearms and in fact got a nice Uzi, Mac10 w/ suppressor and a Greasegun from me, also an Auto Ordinance Thompson.Chuck later married Marylin Chambers and they lived in Las Vegas for some years. Don't know what ever happened to him, might still be there."
3,Anti-Porn,"I was very surprised when I read the other reviews of Linda Lovelace's autobiography on this site. The crimes committed against this woman were horrible. And for those who say she's lying, you are just trying to pretend that we live in a world where the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus make everything chirper. Reading this book could help protect some young girl from being victimized by the porn industry or men in general the way Lovelace was. Go ask any woman you know. Probably every one can tell you an experience she has had where some dirty old (or young) man has tried to paw her just because he thinks it's ok. If you want to be outraged that this kind of sexual abuse happens then you must be willing to take a stand against the sexual mistreatment of women in all forms."
4,Strangely attracting,"I found this book also hidden in my mother's library of books(maybe some strange must have for mothers?), and read it in the 9th grade. While Linda Boreman's life was a horrific experience , I took joy in reading her book. It is something I shared with all of my friends, and would encourage others to read. Unfortunately mine was stolen by a friend so I no longer have it(sort of like how I stole it from my mother). I would however buy the book in paperback and used, for the price is a tad bit too high. Also Linda Lovelace recently died and was an activist against the abuse in the pornography industry. Highly recommened read."
3,"Ridiculously realistic in the woods. 10 feet is too short, though.","If you are hunting in the fall or late spring, this stuff is perfect for disappearing. It blends incredibly well with deadfall and standing trees. The adhesive is decent, though not super strong (after all, it's meant to be removable after a season). I do wish the roll were a few feet longer; a single roll won't cover a rifle and scope, so you (like me) will likely end up buying a second roll if you want to do a complete job. That's why I took two stars off -- seems the company is deliberately selling an inadequate length to push you to buy more."
2,"good looking camo,however!","this is i guess the best looking camo tape i have seen.but i sware it want stick to its self,probly would be the best i have triedif they would fix it so it would stick on a gun.put this tape on my gun, looks greatbut no kidding i hade to glue it down."
3,This Story of the Mayflower is More Religious than Romantic...,"""The Romantic Story of the Mayflower Pilgrims And Its Place in the Life of To-day"" was published in 1911. It is a fairly short account of some of the events and forces that prompted the famed 1620 landing in Plymouth. There is not much romance to speak of. I enjoyed the chapter that reviewed what happened to each member which is interesting if you have a Mayflower connection, but likely the information is available elsewhere. Features a linked index at the end, nice for a free publication. Has a HUGE list of illustrations, which, of course, are not included.The most boring part was a lengthy account of the 1907 and/or 1910 ceremonies that celebrated the landing. This edition has some irritating editing issues such as about half of the book has centered text (rather than justified on the left like normal)."
4,Two excellent screenplays,"In the UK, the book was published by Grove Press so this is the edition I'll be referring too. Also the title of the book has been incorrectly spelt on the site.The contents are:Platoon by Oliver StoneSalvador by Oliver Stone & Richard Boyle.Whats included in the book are shooting scripts and reading his scripts is a pleasure. Unfortunately, the format of the two scripts has been laid out like a stage play rather then a screenplay format but otherwise its a worthy purchase for anyone interested in Stone's films.Also included are some extracts from Stone's diary covering the shooting of Platoon. Apart from this and a full credit list, there isn't much else. For the price though its worth it."
5,Culture Clash - Thomas Zweifel,"Zweifel has distilled a wealth of intercultural theory, real-life case studies, and personal experience drawn from academia, the military, not-for-profits and the corporate world to produce a unique and fascinating read and an invaluable primer for both the neophyte and experienced international managers alike. As a cross-cultural practitioner, I can highly recommend this refreshing approach to understanding and managing the complexities of doing business across cultures."
4,Its a good movie ... but,"Its a pretty good movie if you understand it wasn't made to be great. It is a ""B"" movie and sometimes those are the best. I like the movie, Betsy Russell did a great job. Not the bes actress in the world but she did pretty good."
1,Tom Dog,What a waste of brain cells this dreck is. The other reviewers appreciate it for it's cheese factor and that's too high praise. This flick is a complete bore. It reminds me of a bad afternoon school special with gratuitous nudity thrown in. Star Betsy Russell has a certain Felicity quality to her without Keri Russell's acting chops. I guess you had to have been there. Wait a minute! I was! This movie still stinks.
3,Stick with regular Bumkins bibs,The regular Bumkins bibs seem to have better coverage up top. The length just doesn't seem necessary to me.
1,Not supersized,"No idea why what I received is different than the other reviewers, but the bib I got looked like it was for a baby and DID not even go to my 2 yr old's waist let alone his knees. In fact, the neck closure was even too small for him. He is a normal sized 2 yr old. I was VERY upset when I opened it. It wasn't worth returning so I just gave it to my sister who is having a baby soon but I would not recommend buying this item from them. I believe they sent me the wrong bib, the artwork was the same it was just not the right size."
4,Great bib,"This is an excellent bib. I've always liked the Bumkins bibs, and loved the idea of a bigger one. It works quite well. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because while I think it's great, it's not the best I've ever used."
1,Sound amusing? It isn't.,"I'm certainly no prude and I like noisy music. I also find toilet humor funny like most men. However, I find this CD completely pointless and tedious. It is not at all funny, and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found. Every track of this excrutiatingly long CD is essentially the same -- a guy screaming lyrics in a strong French accent that sound as if they were written by a 14-year-old over unclassifiable, unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally. I suppose some folks would know that a CD with a penis on the cover and a title like ""Lung Farts"" would not be their cup of tea, but for those (like me) who think these would be selling points, trust me, they ain't."
3,I Will Repay,"Although I enjoyed the story and wanted to read it because it belongs in the Pimpernel Series, this particular download had a weird glitch that made all quotation marks into question marks. As long as the page I was on had little to no dialogue, it wasn't too bad. It did get a little annoying though when there was a lot of dialogue. If there's a way for me to correct this, I'd appreciate knowing how. Overall story was satisfying and sparked my interest in the history of the period."
1,Junk.,I received this product after viewing it online. When it arrived I opened the box and I could not believe what I saw. There wrapped in foam was a piece of foam with a brush less motor strapped to it. All of the flaps were held on with scotch tape. That all would have been fine if the thing worked. It was broken in the box when it arrived. I am still waiting for a refund!
5,Glad I read it.,I bought this book as a companying reading to <Lives of the Poets> by Michael Schmidt. (Schmidt quotes Leavis here and there.) Leavis' describes his angles of interception with the horizon of language and rhetorics; the description is as interesting as his thoughts.
1,Don't buy - CD has a trojan!,"I started using this book and it looked excellent. I put in the CD and was using it with the text. When I tried to shut down my computer later it wouldn't shut down - said ""Winclickme.exe"" wouldn't close. I restarted the computer and did a search and found that others had had this problem from the CD - please see other reviews for more details. It is really too bad because the book looks great and it is one which needs the CD to be used for practice."
5,excellent!!!!,i only have this game but it's really really cool like how you can throw practically ANYTHING at bad guys or eachother!!!!! like you can pick up barrels filled with gasoline and BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!! it blows bad guys up! or you can wreck a car covered in bad guys like say you were being chased after by tricatons well lead them over to a car and slice it all up and BOOM!!!! no more triceratons but they just keep coming through the wrecks!!
3,Not our puppies favorite toy,"Our puppy will play with his toys first, and he managed to chew off the whiskers within the first day. It is smaller than I expected."
3,OK; not great,"I used this book in a policing ethics class. The students loved it and I felt it was a good, accessible way for some of the more complicated aspects of ethical reasoning to ""soak in."" It's a bit of a rant, however, and Stamper doesn't always integrate higher-level themes about policing, philosophy, etc. into his writing. I will use it once more for teaching and then look for another title."
3,Decent Zelda Wannabe,"The story is okay. The game play is action oriented and fun, but nothing great. The graphics are good. The load times can take quite a long time and happen fairly frequently (enough to take a bit away from the fun)It attempts to play similar to Zelda or the Secret of Mana, but falls far short from the fun, story, and overall appeal.Overall, this game is decent and worth paying a discounted price for but I'm still looking for a great adventure / role playing game. Buy it used if you can."
5,awesome,looking forward to watching season 4 because season 3 was awesome and it can only get better. this show is soooo stinkin funny. buy it.
1,The Grand,"Hugely disappointing. May deserve more than the one star, but considering how incredibly good Penn's ""Loch Ness"" was, this was such a let down. Some of the characters are quite irritating and lot of the time it's just unfunny."
2,Interesting concept poor execution,"Let me prefice this review by saying I enjoy watching the world Series of Poker on ESPN. I have followed it for several years, so I was anxious to watch this movie.However, what came across as an interesting concept quickly turns into ""Who will have the next cameo"". There are several times in the movie where I felt the plot took a backseat to getting someone screen time.This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but the only thing to laugh at is the poor plot. I can not believe this movie was able to get the star power in it. Not even a high rolling cast of actors could save this terrible story.I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more poker and less filler and uninteresting plot lines.In the end, this is no where near the quality of movie I Was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a poker-ish movie watch Rounders or 21. Skip this one all together and save yourself the time."
1,this is a piece of...,"Stay away from this thing, it is VERY poorly made. The battery fits loosely in the charger and, if it doesn't fall completely out, then it MAY charge the battery if you're lucky. Or, it could stay in the charger all night like I left it and it still may not charge if it not is not situated JUST SO. The best fix is to put the battery in and then tape it in place. Not worth the trouble. I feel ripped off."
5,READY THE EIGHT,JAE GORDON IS AN AMAZING WRITER. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN! IT KEPT ME INTERESTED FROM THE TIME I STARTED TILL THE END.I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE BOOK AND WE SHARE THE SAME OPINION. THIS IS A 2 THUMBS UP BOOK AND SHOULD BE MADE INTO A FEATURE FILM.CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK TO COME OUT.
4,Good Book for Beginners of Civil War History,"A nice overview of the Civil War from the perspective of a young runaway slave. I would recommend this book for later grade school or early middle school children studying the Civil War. The book covers (briefly) plantation life, the assimilation of a former slave into the ""free"" world, and war with it's hardships - lack of food, imprisonment, poor medical resources, ... Simple characters and simple plot - just what a student needs to reinforce the lessons of Civil War studies. Some religious (Christian) overtones."
4,dog jack a awsome book,"this book is about a black slave that runs awwy from the plantation and goes to pennsylvania so he can be free. Their he meets a guy he gose and works in the fier station wiht that guy and the rest of his friends. Then a sing that their is going to be a war an all the fire fighters and jed signed up in the war. An whiel jed is working at the fire station he fins a stray dog and they name the dod, dog jack."
1,Annie or Enya?,"Annie, where did our 'in your face' 'kick your butt' Diva go? When did you turn into a slobering Enya? This CD is a major disappointment. The only song that comes close to the Annie we all grew to love is Bitter Pill and it's just a tired remake. Cliches and poor pitiful me songs are not Annie Lennox songs. Such a long wait for such a big disappointment."
4,Loving Annie Lennox,"This album is Annie at her most exposed, her most vulnerable.If you love this woman, and who doesn't, this CD is a must for your collection. Totally different from anything else she has done, yet completely all Annie, you will find yourself crying and laughing with her throughout."
1,UnBAREably depressing,"When I saw the cover of this album, I thought that it was brilliant because I assumed that the album was about baring her soul. I was so wrong. The whole entire album is about her painful and bitter divorce from her husband Uri. It is not necessary to have a whole entire album about a break-up! All you need is one song and one song only to get the message across. Alanis Morrisette managed to pull off a song about hate with ""You ought to Know"", and Paul Carrack did the same with ""Don't Shead a Tear"". As Carrack said, : ""All that I saw in you, now I see through!"" Maybe Lennox was too cheap to see a therapist? Anyway, if you want to hear really good mope music, get Morrissey's greatest hits."
3,Very nice easy-listening music,"(3 & 1/ stars) Annie Lennox's voice is still a marvel, a gorgeous instrument. You want to immerse yourself in her singing, a rewarding experience that's possible by listening to her new CD, Bare. All eleven songs on the CD were written by Ms. Lennox, and she does expose herself emotionally in the lyrics, delving into a lot of ""aspects of (her) inner world"" (to quote from her own liner notes). Songs like ""The Hurting Time"" and ""Honesty"" are partuclarly revealing.As far as the music goes, these tunes are very pleasant to listen to, but nothing really stands out. Most often the accompaniment to her singing consists of a soft rhythm section, shimmery synths, strings, mellow guitars, etc. On the Diva scale, this music is closer to Sade than Aretha. There a couple of exceptions, most notably the funky ""Bitter Pill,"" but again it is funky-lite, more like George Michael than Al Green. Her singing is great, but Bare would have been even better with more substantial tunes."
5,More wonderful Annie!,I had fallen behind on my Annie Lennox collection so added this one last week. She does not disappoint. Her vocals are stellar and beautiful. What a talent she has!
3,Annie Get Your Gun,"Annie's always been an Artist with a capital A, so this album's pretentiousness is a given. (For starters check out the cover explanation or that subtitle on ""Oh God."") Annie keeps from being just another art rocker, however, by always making sure her pretensions and tastes are undeniably middlebrow. So, we get the expected musical and lyrical clichés burnished to a high sheen. Where Annie excels, however, is in delivering despondency to the masses, and I'll be damned if she hasn't served up the feel-bad album of the year. It's so good in fact, it makes you want to ruin a perfectly good relationship just so you can relate. Guess she really didn't ""Need a Man"" after all...."
5,Fantastic,"Annie Lennox, quite simply, has the most beautiful voice in music. It is remarkable in its clarity and emotion. With every listen, her CD ""Bare"" gets even better. I wish she would do more touring; I'd love to hear her live. While I hope she gets nominated for some Grammys, I won't hold my breath. Why nominate the best vocalist on earth when you've got so many pop tarts like Brittany, Pink and Christina to throw awards at? Annie Lennox has been around for decades. In five years, we'll be asking ""Brittany WHO??"""
1,Same old tired top 40,"Yawn, this is just a collection of the same old boring Top-40 80s songs I've heard a million times. Waste of money!"
1,Fake,"Within 5 minutes of wearing these earrings my ear lobes started swelling up and turning red. These are not real white gold earrings, those who are allergic beware!"
3,the back of the earring,The earring itself is nice. The back of the earring left much to be desired. They fit very loosely and I lost one of the backs only moments after I put it on. I had to go find a old pair of earrings and use their backs. Not happy!
1,Not worth it,When I received these earrings one was missing a earring back. They are pretty big also. I honestly don't think they are worth the price either.
4,she loves these!,"the ball earrings are beautiful and they look great on my wife! only complaint would be that the tension backs are tiny (and, therefore, hard to handle and find) but you could just replace them with tension backs from your unused earrings."
5,future comedy with innuendo,"Followed this series on TV through several day/night/time changes. With the action that went on during the first show, fell in love with it and had to see the ending, although it came too soon. The action of 'Cleopatra' from our time and what she remembered, and thrown into the year 2525 and her reactions to that time made a great laugh riot. Watching several times to see what was missed when on TV only once with no repeats."
4,Hot babes and lots of action,"I used to watch this, just because it was on before Jack of all Trades. I kind of got to ""like"" it, I guess, it had hot women running around in hot outfits. The stories were about these three girls who live underground in the far away future; the surface of the planet is ruled by evil robots, and androids are lurking underground. So these girls are always fighting against the bad guys. The stories are more or less silly, the special effects aren't all that great BUT I have to give these folks points for originality. They had some pretty cool gadgets, like a computer you wore on your wrist that could project a 3-D holographic image of various things.All in all, it was cheesy, silly, had a lot of action, and I guess I mentioned all the hot babes. Okay, the only reason anyone would watch this is for the babes, but, that certainly sets it above all the equally stupid whows without hot babes, so there you go."
5,The Perfect Show for Pizza Night!,"This is a great show! Three beautiful women fighting evil robots and clowns? You can't get much better! The dialog is corny and the situations are unrealistic; but the interaction among characters is excellent! Sit back and enjoy!The DVD set is just as great as the show. You get a blooper real (showcasing how much fun the actors had with one another), an episode of Earth 2 (which really isn't very good), and others!If you enjoy mindless action shows, pick up Cleopatra 2525!"
2,"Barely even campy fun. Great if you once watched ""Power Rangers"" but just hit puberty.","If you liked ""Buffy"" but you're put off by things like plot, story, editing, acting, character development, and production values, you will like this.If you liked ""Power Rangers"" when you were in grade school but you've now hit puberty and you're into boobs squished into ill-fitting outfits, you will probably turn down the sound when you watch this.If you were considering a career in costuming but wanted to see what it would look like if you only used scrap-booking skills, try this on for size!Did you just get back from the bar, failing with the women as usual, and you need some babe-cake along with your buzz to ease you into the evening? Watch Cleopatra 2525, and keep hope alive!"
1,Bad science fiction is better than this book,"I read this book based upon the statements made on the dust jacket. Gosh was I disappointed. The author seems to think that NASA is engaged in some sort of immense, multi-decade conspiracy to silence Dr. Levin, the main 'hero' of this disjointed tale, as he claims to have found life on Mars back in 1976. Some of the book, while meant to be serious, is rather humorous given the dark, almost comical paranoia with which it was written. As a practicing biochemist, I have to say that the author throws around scientific terms with little or no concern for the accuracy of the sentences he uses these terms within. He clearly does not understand the science he claims to be presenting."
2,A stunning achievement not seen since the Bible,"Wow what a book.Well children it was fun reading but hard to follow and bit hard to believe. Written by a believer who assumes you know everything the writers knows. It leaves one asking, huh?Space stuff, Mars, bio-harzard, Nazis, evil scientists, Cabals at the highest levels of government. NASA as the apex of cruel information suppression. Conspiracy and lots and lots of wordsMarty"
4,Great Songs & Wonderful Singers!,"Much has been said and written about Donny & Marie both good and bad over the years, but these two are truly talented singers and performers. This album though lacking many of their best hits (Winning Combination, It Takes Two, I'm A little Bit Country...) is the only D&M Greatest Hits package currently available. It's certainly worth having in YOUR collection!"
3,"Easy read, not as insightful as I'd hoped.","This was a book I looked forward to reading but was disappointed by it. While the author has had some interesting experiences, I found his reflections to be centered on the events in his life rather than on spiritual lessons he had been presented. I felt like I was reading a travelogue rather than a spiritual autobiography. It's very easy to read and I have had a few ""ah ha"" moments while reading it, but in general I found it to be a bit superficial. Who knows though- maybe its the spot I was in when I read it."
3,Uneven content within,"The late Rabbi Alan Lew's One God Clapping is an uneven work. At times memoir, at others confessional, Lew charts his course as a spiritual seeker from his early youth, through his Zen years, to his career as a Conservative rabbi. I suppose the deepest flaw in the book is the flat and uninspired prose. Lew had a creative writing degree from Iowa, and this work does not reveal it. Only toward the end of the book, where Lew charts his course as a rabbi, does the prose come alive.Yet for all its flaws, the book is informative. It charts a unique (but in certain ways, growing less unique) spiritual journey from west to east to west. And Lew's contribution wedding both halakah and Jewish meditation cannot be underscored or undervalued."
2,for beginner rehabbers,"This ""book"" should be in the ""complete idiots guide to..."" series. Recommended for the clueless beginners."
1,I lost all my data on the drive,"Goback locked up the system shortly after windows started. I could not do anything but power cycle the system. After that, Window would never boot. Even after reinstall the Windows, all the drives were no longer recognized. A lot of critical information was lost. Heed the advice: don't install it even if it is free."
2,Has some good points,This book makes good points however I found it very basic. I have studied the subject for years though. It could be good for someone just getting into these areas. I was hoping for more indepth information. SW
5,Sin can run very deep !,"When I first picked up this book I thought it would be telling me about the ""usual sins"" where the big drug companies are selling us poisons like Vioxx & Zorcor but it is much scarier than that.Folks we are being manipulated, and have been for decades, so the people with the top 1% I.Q.s (Md's & Meark Exec's)can up grade from gold to platinum bathroom fictures.Virtually every organization that should be looking out for you is ""in the tank"" for this corrupt medical system...like the FDA and the best regulations money can buy.Please read this book and save your own life."
5,Knowing the truth will truly make you free!!,"Brilliant, Brilliant. This is one of the most important books I have ever read in my life. It is thoroughly researched, and contains undisputable evidence that the current food / medical industry is part of a large Matrix designed to keep us as constant consumers of their poisonous products. There is no need to argue over what we BELIEVE, we must study to show ourselves approved, so that we may KNOW. Thank you DR.Whitaker; you most certainly have showed yourself approved and the Most High and the Ancestors are smiling upon you.-PEACE"
3,"Soft, comfy shoes....wish I could wear them!","I was thrilled to find these shoes! They run wide, as do my feet, so thought I'd have a comfy pair of shoes for everyday wear. I bought a nice, conservative tan pair. I have a problem with static electricity. Year round, I'm constantly getting zapped. Using the copier or the fax at work is misery, cuz I get zapped every time. I brush up against a wall corner and get zapped because under the paint is a little metal piece. When I wore my Crocs (for an entire week), I thought I was going to end up with burn marks. The static problem was greatly intensified while wearing these shoes. I don't know why, but if you have a problem with static, you do NOT want these. I had to give them away."
3,"Weird-looking and big, but VERY comfortable","They work great surviving the dirt and water of the garden, which is what I use them for. The holes on the top, though, let the dirt in so my feet get more dirty than expected. The ""army"" green color was a little lighter than I'd hoped for...So far the dog hasn't chewed them, so they're a hit! I don't imagine wearing them anywhere in public."
5,Muchas Gracias,"Muchas gracias, compre desde venezuela sin ningun problema, me llego la mercancia a tiempo y en buen estado, como acordadon recibi la mercancia en la direccion acordada, muy agradecido"
1,Christmas Gift that broke,Croc strap broke the first time it was worn. Not pleased with this product at all.
3,Beware of Seller,"The crocs are okay it's the seller that is not okay! The crocs broke second day of vacation. I wrote the seller. The seller told me they would send extra clips whioh was fine but if these broke, I would have to contact the factory. They (the seller) DO NOT stand by the products they sell. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! ELECTRIKID - not sure of the exact spelling."
4,as good as described.,"only the color is a little ligher than it looks on the screen. it has very good quality, comfortable and was made in Canada."
5,Husband enjoys Crocs,"My husband loves his Crocs. They are comfortable to wear outside, and he doesn't complain about his feet hurting from his old sandals. I think that Crocs will probably be a definite yes in this family."
3,Bad Sizing,"I am a Croc addict. There, I said it. BEWARE!!!! Crocs Classic and Crocs Beach have completely different sizing. I wear a W9 in Classic and they all fit like a dream. The same in Beach looks like duck shoes. Huge. These shoes in yellow were not available at this time in the Classic style, so I took a leap. The wrong one. The shoes were returned and my credit was issued immediately. No problem with the shoe or seller, it wasmy fault, but the sizing needs to be standard across all sizes. As far as the transaction with this seller, it gets 5 stars. Crocs themselve get the 3 stars. Will still buy more though!"
5,Great Purchase,"My son wears a 15 1/2, and we bought the size 14/15 and they fit him fine. Because he wears such a big size we had to pay more, but they were well worth it."
3,these will do,"Bought a pair with the same UPC from a sports chain locally, so I got the right size. Mine were made in Mexico. Will use them primarily to wash my cars and work in the backyard. I don't know how long the strap will last. But it is in place so far, so I shouldn't complain yet. The front holes are positioned odd. The ""index"" finger is sticking out and unprotected. Why not skip this one hole or use a different pattern? Besides that, the crocs feel comfortable. They don't seem to mark floors and decks, which was my requirement. I guess they will do."
4,Winwood dares to change,I have always been a fan of Steve Winwood and it's great to see a musician experiment with different sounds. This is a very good set of new music and the quality is excellent. If you like Steve Winwood check this dvd out.
3,Good fan,"I have two. Not quite as silent as I thought it would be, but it moves a decent amount of air. It is much quieter and more efficient(heat management wise) than the previous, single fan setup. One is used for intake and the other for exhaust. I'd generally recommend it."
5,"Inspired, Hypnotic Home-made Classic","F.M. Cornog uses his Tascam 8-track to great effect, creating a richly textured collection of songs of resignation and deluded dreams. The guitar work on some of the best songs (ie., Bring on the Loser, Metal Detector) is reminiscent of Vini Reilly's guitar stylings with Durutti Column, while other songs flower into gorgeous guitar riffs (Marty, Powerful Man) that evoke Galaxy 500. Cornog turns simple phrases into mantras that you just might find yourself repeating while you're out walking the dog."
2,They took all the science out.,"This season of sliders was not as good as the first two seasons. They took all the science out of it and replaced it with ridiculous stories. With the exception of a very few episodes (Murder most foul, slide like an Egyptian, the guardian and double cross) it was a very disappointing season. I don't think that either the director or producers know where they were going in season 3, because they made the biggest foul up of them all by killing off the professor (the father figure of the group).Season 3 is not worth the effort. The stories are just too dumb down."
5,You must buy this if you are a sliders fan.,"This is the best season of sliders, and sadly the last season that had the characters Professor Arturo played by John Rhys-Davies, and Wade Welles played by Sabrina Lloyd, in it. The show for me went downhill after that. I blame the Sci-Fi channel for this."
4,"Good, not great","There are a lot of cool episodes in season 3, but I've noticed that there are several episodes that deviate from science and compelling hypothetical worlds into cheesy worlds of witchcraft, magic, special powers and such. Overall, I think the set is good, but not great."
5,Easy to understand and follow a real practical guidance to development,The book is excellent for professional that are looking for development. Something good about having this book is its usefulness throught different stage of the professional life where different challenges and behavorial factors are competing. Excellent resource for mastering managerial and team skills.
4,FYI 3rd Ed,The book is well organized and gives good recipes to solve problems. I recommend it for people who wants to implement a people development system in a company or simply use it for a personal development plan. It lacks a software or template for self assessment to go straightforward for implementation.
3,"Worth renting, not buying","I wouldn't sing hosannas about The Last Run, but I did enjoy it, The writing is clever and the characterizations, though rendered in shorthand, were clear and interesting. The ending is kind of hard to believe but you do find yourself hoping it could come true.Worth renting, not buying."
5,Great sharpener!,"I could never get the hang of using those sharpening sticks or whatever they're called. Several years ago I found a one stage sharpener and have been using it for probably 15 years, but it has not been sharpening well lately. I couldn't remember where I bought it, so I hit Amazon and found this little gem. It's very similar to what I had with the exception of it being 2 stage. It does an awesome job...I love it! I use the first stage to sharpen and the second stage to remove any burrs."
4,"Handy, compact sharpener","This is a handy, compact sharpener and easy to use. Mine came with simple instructions and sharpens both knives and scissors. We use the knife sharpener every week."
1,dulls knives,"have used for months, still expecting sharper instead of duller; unit has tiny pieces of sharpening stone set at angles, but knife can wobble through at different angles; so frustrated finally turned my belt sander upside down, ran it on constant, and guided my main kitchen knife- sabatier steel chef's knife that ought to sharpen easily- several strokes with some sparks on each side; got a near razor edge; stubbronly, put it through the wusthoh to see if it would further hone the edge; became dull enough to run your finger over; i finally gave up and chucked the wusthof"
4,Wusthof makes a quality product that's easy to use,"How much needs to be said about a knife sharpener? This one works exceptionally well, is easy to hold and control while in use, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. It probably isn't an item you'll find in a professional kitchen, it's very well suited for your kitchen. REMEMEMBER: A DULL KNIFE IS A DANGEROUS THING!"
3,Disappointing,"I can't say that I am impressed with this thing - it works at first, but the knife edges become ragged over time."
3,This is not what you think it is,"This is not a sharpener, it is a 2-stage honer. A sharpener is supposed to remove material from the blade to create a new cutting surface. This is a honer, it does the same job as your steal will do. It will smooth the edge of the blade to remove the burs ."
5,Simple and effective,"This works great, I am totally pleased and surprised in how effective it is. Highly recommended for those who don't want to fuss or for those who are tired of fussing with elaborate sharpening schemes. Pull the blade through a few times and welcome to your almost like-new knife edge."
4,Knife Sharpener,A good product. My knife edges hold a sharpness for a fairly long time. I like this.
2,Broke after 5 uses,"I received this item as a gift for christmas. It worked well enough, though I was a little perturbed to see that the ""course"" knife sharpener was just a couple of pieces of stainless steel. Not to worry though, one of them fell out (I don't know how or when, I just went to sharpen one of my knives and the piece was gone.) I guess I shouldn't have thrown that chunk of metal I found on the kitchen floor away.Had the sharpener not broken I would have rated it with 4 or 5 stars, now, 2."
3,Too much padding!,"When I was looking for a car seat for my first baby, I thought this model would be the best because it had more padding than all the others and I loved the pattern. My daughter is only 8 weeks old and 11 lbs and she already looks uncomfortable. The extra padding makes the seat very narrow. I can barely get my hands around her to pick her up. It's also very heavy and I'm supposed to be able to use it for at least another 9 lbs! I've noticed also that the seat and back meet up at a very erect angle and unless you really push her butt down in the hole, she always looks like she's not sitting up enough. I will be exchanging this Mayfair model."
3,"No frills book, but it worked","I used this book to test my German skills, not to learn German. I was scoring around 90% on the tests in the book. I scored high enough in the actual CLEP exam to achieve credit for four semesters German.There were a few problems (multiple choice questions not in the same order as the verbal questions), but the tests were very similar to the actual CLEP sections. It allowed me to evaluate my knowledge."
2,Misleading and disappointing!,"Even though the description said this pack was a large, and intended to fit my 13x9x2 Pyrex, it is really much smaller than the one I needed to replace. Very disappointing!"
1,Even An Adorable Accent Can't Save This One,"A bad cold and a lack of cable led me to invest my dollar at Redbox. What a mistake. I figured it would be cliche in spots...but oh, the whole way through! Amy Adams' cute clothes and the lush landscape were somewhat distracting, but the unreliable car, the pretend marriage that leads to a forced, revelatory kiss, the off-handed comments that change their lives...even a NyQuil haze couldn't make this film interesting. Save your money and your time."
3,An Adams & Goode not-so-good movie,"You might want to think twice before making this turkey the centerpiece of your 2012 Leap Year day celebration.This preposterous, predictable, slapsticky romantic comedy has two things going for it: a cinematographer who really knows how to show off the beauty of Ireland and, in its last half hour or so, some somewhat believable chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. Otherwise what we've got here is a mishmash of tired old Irish characters, caricatures, cliches and battle-of-the-sexes banter reminiscent of old '40s movies, way too many mishaps involving getting drenched and falling down in the mud in high heels; a script that does neither its stars nor its scenery justice and borrows its ending from the better-done Hugh Grant-Andie MacDowell not-exactly-a-proposal scene In ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."""
4,Touching sweet love story,"Anyone who likes Amy Adams will like Leap Year. Shot in Ireland, the cinematography is beautiful as well as the sound track.Especially the very different and haunting version of Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break your Heart."" The film is a mix of old and modern values and comes out some where in between, making it a film anyone can enjoy.The script is weak in places, but the actors carry it through and even though it is some what predictable so is every other romantic comedy."
2,Turned it off half way through...,Nothing special. No chemistry between the main actors. Dragged on. Turned it off somewhere in the middle.
1,Just ok,Just this side of a sleeper - story line was better than the acting. At least the scenery was beautiful
4,Cheesy but cute,"Let's just be honest, I liked the movie a bunch but it is cheesy and is predictable on a lot of the plot but I still like it."
4,The Earliest Bobby Hackett,"These are some of the earliest Bobby Hackett recordings from 1938-1940. 14 of the 16 tracks were recorded under the name of Bobby Hackett and His Orchestra. Two of the tracks were recorded under the name of Leonard Feather. The liner notes do not make any of this clear, and the cover picture is clearly Hackett at a later stage in his life. Nevertheless, the tracks are good, solid dixieland jazz, as interpreted in the swing era. There is one vocal track, ""Blue and Disillusioned,"" featuring Linda Keene. All the other tracks are instrumentals. The highlight is Hackett's 1940 interpretation of ""Singing the Blues."""
2,"""You Are Terminated"" From This Score, Beltrami.","Though I personally thought ""Terminator 3"" wasn't really bad, it wasn't that good either. And the score is even worse. With the exception of ""T3"" and the main theme from the first two movies, the music is atrocious. The last two tracks sound more appropriate for romantic films instead of a sci-fi movie. Why James Cameron & Brad Fiedel weren't involved with the third movie is a mystery to me, as they also made ""The Terminator"" franchise into what it is with the first two movies. Don't waste your money on this soundtrack. Stick with the albums for the first two films."
2,Filler Paper,Can't rate as receipent never received even though it was signed for at the receiving end.
1,lack of simple organized flow,"As a first timer I found this book to be very confusing. It jumped around with no simple beginning to end flow that this beginner could follow. It appeared to simply identically repeat the help file that came with the program which contained no beginning to end, step by step applicable flow in a language I could understand. Chapters well into the book contained steps that should have been done initially, etc."
4,An experience,"One of Shyam Benegal's finest work, this movie is about a Portugal family in Goa and their struggle to come in terms with the death of the head of the family, all amidst the backdrop of an Indian army assembled to attack and take over Goa. The movie will make you experience the Goan Portuguese culture, their lifestyle, their music (watch out for the young Remo Fernandez and Alisha Chennai in 1985), and in the end, you feel as if you have actually experienced the entire happening. The costumes, the names, the behavior of the characters are all very authentic, and one thing is for sure, the next time you are in Goa, you will pause and think for a second about its unique and diverse culture and the place it holds in the Indian history."
2,"All puff, no substance.","I was truly looking forward to Chopra's latest book,THE PATH to LOVE. Unfortunately, my expectations were squelched when I got to yet another dead end discussion on love. Chopra puts the problem out there, but offers no guidance on solving it. He distracts his readers with goofy quizzes, and then leaves you yearning for a solution to your predicament. I was disappointed with his pseudo-philosophy for love that always ended up back at ""getting in touch with your spirit."" It was all too abstract for this reader. You could call this novel, THE PATH to NOWHERE"
3,"Interesting, but not great.","John Ney Rieber, The Books of Magic: Reckonings (Vertigo, 1997)Reckonings, the third book in the Sandman spinoff Books of Magic series, is a marked improvement over book two, though it's still not up to the standard set by the Sandman series.In this one, Tim and Molly, along with a few extraplanar friends, are off gallavanting when Molly gets kidnapped by a bunch of pink dinosaurs. (I kid you not.) In order to rescue her, Tim has to brave the fires of Hell-- except that Hell has no fires. Hell is a vast bureaucracy just waiting to implode upon itself.It's amusing enough for what it is, but the narrative lacks the Gaiman touch, substituting labyrinthine plot twists for Gaiman's dark characterization and master's touch with detail. Still, it's enjoyable enough to keep me going in the series. ***"
4,Average,"This is an official public health administration issue that is dealing with the problem of impotence. A lot of technical and scientific data with lots of in depth information that is guaranteed to be certified and accurate. A great read for the professional or the doctor, but not so good for suffering man, who should try ""Natural Penis Enlargement: New Methods of Avoiding and Curing Impotence, Premature Ejaculation, and Erectile Dysfunction Safely and Inexpensively. New ... No Pumps, No Pills and No Gadgets! Vol. 2"" by Platinum Millennium, which is a book aimed exactly at impotence and sexual disorders and their respective treatments"
5,One Of The Best Cd's.. Timeless,"Natalie is at her Prime!!!! She is worthy of singing such timeless, and ""Unforgettable"" songs.. Many albums that I buy, I skip songs, but you can leave the whole CD running... DON'T LISTEN TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWS!!!!! They obviously don't have an appreciation for FINE music... She sings many of her dad's songs... I must say that she does them very well... maybe even better then her father... THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE!!!!! My favorite CD ever!!!!!!Reise"
5,Movie filmed in Brooksville,I grew up in Brooksville. The doctors office in the movie was my wife's OB/GYN office! Can't think of anything else to write on this review. I should not have to come up with a certain amount of works to say something is great!
4,A lot of you just dont know what youre saying,"maybe its cause half are prolly born in the late 80's or early 90's . i really think its that . the person who said about it being like 94'' all over again . well i can relate and agree . this is just one of those power pop alternative bands . there is no refrence of anything punk here . the fact that a lot of you are so young you use terms like nu-metal and sware anything that sounds like blink 182 is pop punk etc. . please research music more .i cant stand the fact you created this nu metal label , let alone the whole bashing of anything pop and running to untalented pop indie bands and worship them to feel good about yourselves or gain respect from others . the harder you kids try to label , the worse youre making this . this cd wasnt meant for ground breaking . its just supposed to be a fun alternative cd . im not into this band but even i noticed that upon listening to the songs ..."
5,Really really really good!,"I really liked this CD because it's not dark depressing rock (I like that a little), but it's not icky nasty bubblegum junk(I don't like that at all!). Noelle has a really pretty voice. Oh and Dustin, the drummer, is a really good drummer and he's cute. It took me like three weeks to find this CD. It was super frustrating. Of course, I shouldn't have expected to find it though because I live in the middle of nowhere. Finally when I went on vacation and I was in some mall in Portsmith, Nh, I found it and I rejoiced. All the songs are good escpecially Feel Bad Vibe, Driveway Blues, and You and I. Since I've heard it a thousand times because I have it on another CD , Frustrated Unnoticed is the teensiest bit annoying. I still love it though. This band is cool because you can't really label them. Those are the kind of bands I love."
1,Junk,"I bought this dash mount because it got such great reviews here. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with it. This mount will not work for any car with a curved or sloping dashboard. If you have a flat dash, great, this mount is for you. The base is rigid and does not conform to the dashboard. I found this to be unbelievable, considering its design. Why have 4 beanbag weights if its rigid?! I expected this mount to be like the Garmin version that is floppy and conforms immediately to any surface. The other problem with it is that the bottom is not sticky/tacky like the Garmin, its foam rubber that slides around too easily. This mount continually slid off my dash in a short test.The best solution I've found is Exogear's mount. I don't work for them, but they make a great product. Its a suction cup mount that not only mounts to glass, but ANY flat surface such as drywall, wood, vinyl dash, etc."
3,Ok reading,"I purchased this book because I was interested in Malcolm X teachings and getting a better understanding of his views. I read his autobiography and saw his movie, but I don't know his speeches. This book touched on some of his ideas, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. This was a short phamplet of his last 3 part speech,(Jan 24th 1965 speech) which I think was laying the foundation for the new program OAAU. It did touch on Brother Malcolm's veiws of Afro American history and he does refer listeners (readers) to the books he read and places he been. I think I would have liked it better if it combined all three speeches (Jan 24th, Jan 31 and his Feb 15th speech)."
3,Anne Mather,"The only two men in Madeline's life so far had been gentle and kind, wanting only to protect and cherish her. Nicholas Vitale was anything but gentle, kind or protective - but Madeline couldn't resist him. But if she got involved with him, would she bring herself anything but heartbreak?"
5,Delicious,"Absolutely addicting. I was kind of hoping the frosting container went to the bottom of the tube, but they still give you a good amount. Definitely will be ordering a bulk amount of them."
5,"Great book, exactly like US edition inside","Bought this book for one of my classes, when I got it I was nervous it would be different from the US edition. All my worries were put to rest because this book worked perfect with my class. No complications at all with page numbers or problems."
4,Good text,I had to have this book for a Master's level HR class. It was easy to follow and had lots of really good information. The book arrived on time and resold pretty well on Amazon.
2,Reading Rabbit,My almost 5 year old blasted through this program in two days. It's wasn't very engaging or difficult. I've since bought The Reading Lesson workbook and we're getting amazing results.
1,Doesn't Work With MAC OS X or Windows 7!,"The software requirements do not indicate that the software will not actually work with operating systems that we all use today. I tried to install this on my Mac OS X and on Windows 7. Neither one worked, the publisher's websites have no commentary, fixes or support for this issue. Not sure why anyone would actually sell this product but unless you are using a 5 year old computer don't bother."
1,Not compatable with Windows 7,This is old software and will not work with my windows 7 PC.I would like another new version of the software or a refund.
4,Braxton's tribute to his influences.,"Anthony Braxton works his way through eight Lennie Tristiano songs, one by Warne Marsh, and two standards (one by Irving Berlin). As usual, Braxton breaks out the arsenal of woodwinds on which he is proficient but for this recording limits himself to using members of the sax and flute family. Jon Raskin contributes baritone sax to several cuts; I'm not familiar with the original Tristiano recordings but putting the baritone on the front line suits the compositions well. An almost flawless recording that might be a revelation to those naysayers that claim that Braxton can't play jazz (ie: ""standards""). Flaw? Some songs tear along at a breakneck tempo that forces the soloists to make a display of technique rather than expression. Still good, though.With John Raskin, baritone sax; Dred Scott, piano; Cecil McBee, bass; Andrew Cyrille, drums."
5,Depends on who you are,"I loved this DVD personally, but I am NOT saying that everyone will. If you are a casual UFC fan, and that's what you expect to see you will be sorely disappointed. This is small time MMA in the days where they were still tossing the term ""NHB"" around. If you don't know what that means, again, you probably shouldn't buy this DVD.That said, if you are the kind of MMA fan that I am, who appreciates a good fight no matter the camera quality and the name of the fighter, then you'll love this. It's an excellent buy especially for the price I got it for (under $4). The only bad thing I can say about the whole set is that Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson is a terrible ringside announcer and his knowledge of MMA is on par with John McCain's. This also contains the infamous KOTC: Wet & Wild, where all of the fights were outdoors in the middle of a bad rainstorm and every fight includes fighters falling over and slipping on a wet mat... kind of annoying."
4,Does the Job,"Takes awhile to settle on temp of item being measured (5-10 seconds), but I cannot afford one that's instant read. For what it costs, this thermometer does the trick."
3,Doesn't automatically turn off,"This thermometer does a good job of getting the temperature of cooking meats within 10 seconds or so, so nothing to complain about there. However, when we bought ours the battery in it was already dead and there was some rust inside! After scraping the oxidation off and replacing the battery, it works fine, but it seems silly to have to pay for a new battery right away. Also, be aware that it doesn't automatically shut itself off. I bought this to use on Thanksgiving and what with everything happening in the kitchen, I forgot to turn it off and found it still on several hours later. I'll make an effort not to forget to turn it off in the future, but auto shut off seems like a basic feature."
3,What Curtis says is relevant,"Yet he does not say enough. He speaks well, on how to handle sympathy, dialogue, action, detail, and characterization. All in chapter 39. The only chapter I really learned from. Key word, learned. Can't give a bad review, if you learn something! Still, for the money, there are better books on writing."
1,There are better options,I purchased this andSentence Diagramming: A Step-by-Step Approach to Learning Grammar Through Diagrammingto teach myself diagramming. I found both mediocre.I triedGrammar by Diagramand the Grammar by Diagram Workbook and the concepts stuck in my mind. It's much better. I had to purchase it from the publisher's website because it's overpriced on Amazon. I'll be ordering a fresh copy of the workbook next year to use with my son.
4,Back to Basics,"I'm a writer myself, who-like everyone else-has trouble spots where I'm uncertain what word to use, or if I should be using a modifier near a verb, or if voice is active or passive. I think learning how to diagram sentences is the right direction to go in, and I think every school ought to adopt this well done, straightforward, thin book that yet has all you need to know to learn how to write well. Dr. Hayes has another grammar book out-Troublesome Grammar-that I also use. I'd like to see her make sequels to both texts. I never feel embarrassed now when I write reports."
3,Ok cd but cd rom limited,"There are many Cher cd's on the market.This one deals with some nice earlier Imperial and MCA hits and more. The cd-rom has only a few large images of Cher, and it is really more of a come on than a treat. But The Way of Love 2 cd set first!(american release).If you are a collector buy it as you see fit. No great revelations of unreleased Cher music here."
4,Jamie's Journey,"In this touching story about Jamie and his challenging journey through life, Joe Lasker points out the differences and difficulties of a child with what he and his wife call ""The Invisible Handicap."" Using the voice of Jamie's brother, the author sensitively shares with his readers a glimpse at what it is like to live with someone like Jamie. Through the use of not only facts, but also emotions, Joe Lasker has done a terrific job of heightening the awareness of young and old alike to the trials and triumphs of a child like Jamie and his family who daily journey through his learning disability. I enthusiastically recommend this book for teaching children how to relate to those with special needs."
4,"A Commuter CD That'll Get You There, But Not Back","I think the main thing I noticed about this CD is that it doesn't feel as long as 50 minutes. And, that's after waiting a little while for the 'hidden track' after CROWN. (Who else is annoyed with hidden tracks?) That said, I just wished the songs were longer. They're good songs that just seem uncompleted. RUN--the song I bought the CD for--should go on for 6 minutes at least.I don't feel Collective Soul rocks as hard as they did in Undisciplined Breakdown, but the songs are more melodic this time around, very similar to The GooGoo Dolls. At least every song is listenable, as opposed to the Goo's DIZZY UP THE GIRL which has some very uneven moments. Unfortunately, even the best songs on DOSAGE fall short of SLIDE, BROADWAY & IRIS."
2,this is what i've waited for?????,"i am a huge collective soul fan, but this cd is a big let down. i can't recommend it. if this is what the band's recent good fortunes means to their music, they need to disband. this cd is one step from elevator music."
5,A Band For The New Millennium,"Collective Souls` Dosage CD is simply fantastic! I don`t think there is a bad song on it.This is an excellently orchistrated,ROCKIN CD! They are a very talented and tight band.A band for the new millennium! Much Luck For The Future Guys ! KeepItUp!"
3,Will these guys please put out a great album already?,"Take this group's best songs from all of their CDs and you have one hell of a classic CD. But the reality is that their CDs taken one by one are mediocre. I'd highly recommend their self-titled 2d CD as their highpoint. This one is decent, but again---no masterpiece."
5,Awesome Album,In this one Collective Soul are more sythesizer stuff. Just about every album is different in a way. That is cool
4,Sounds for the summer,"Collective Soul is first and foremost a pop-rock band, so if you're in the mood for something deep and poignant, this CD isn't going to fit the bill. However, what this CD does offer is eleven solid pop gems that together will make a great soundtrack for the coming summer. Most people should be familiar with the single ""Run"", and several songs on this CD hold up in quality to it, with the others following closely behind. The instrumentation and production are so polished that you sometimes forget that you're listening to what are, at heart, very simple songs. ""Dosage"" holds up with replaying, too. This CD is, in a word, fun."
3,2 Highlights...,"To me-- this CD is pretty weak without the two main songs... Heavy, and Run. Although having these two songs is worth the price, don't expect a lot more out of it."
1,"Good Looks, No Substance.","Ordered my monitor a few weeks ago based on positive reviews and attractive styling. I have used it for business applications, watching movies, and photo editing.* My monitor featured 2 stuck pixels.* It gives an incredible strain for the eyes, except at the lowest contrast setting. I've used LCD monitors for 6 years, and never experiences such discomfort before.* Background illumination of the screen is not uniform, and changes significantly with the vertical viewing angle. The published vertical angle specification is a joke - my monitor is not even close to meeting it.So far it has been a major disappointment, and i would not recommend this monitor."
3,donsnt fit my gun,It's nice and I do like it but it the lock that goes over the gun doesn't fit and its a 4.5 barrow. Beside that I like!!! Oh well I guess I'll have to get a diff gun lol
4,Worked great for my costum,I went as the Punisher for Halloween and they looked great. There was still plenty of room around my 42 inch waist.
5,Perfect for a great Price,"I ordered this for my Black Widow costume and it is perfect! Everything is adjustable -- I'm pretty small (5'3"" and 123 lbs) and I've been able to size it perfectly to my legs and waist. There is still plenty of room, so if you're smaller than me, have no fear! And on the opposite end of the spectrum, I'm confident this will fit a large and muscular guy too.I'm using this to house my costume props, but this is some tough material, so if other reviewers are using this product for an actual weapon and magazines, I don't doubt for a second that this will work for those as well.Over all, I'm very happy with this purchase. It arrived right on time. Great price, great seller, great product."
3,Good while it lasted,"I purchased this item before now and was very pleased with it. when i purchased this item a gain it was a pice of garbage. It was soothing out of the ordinary meaning of the good one i got the first time. When i was running around with it i tripped and fell ( no damage to me) but the holster seemed good for the next five seconds. Then, the leg strap came off the holster, so that the holster was winging by the support rope on my belt. I was so mad i could barely talk. I think it's still a good product, but they need to have better quality checks before this product goes out for use. If bought be careful with it."
4,not bad,This is a pretty sweet piece to hold you sidearm weapon and spare mags along with speed loaders along the way u place on yourself helps u a lot dislike the gun holster doesn't switch out on which side to where u can use it but it will do....
2,3 piece set,"i got this product because i wanted the mag leg strap and its perfect for the price once again. the mag pouch slipped onto my leg perfectly and because its a mag pouch its simple and easy just need to wear in.. you also get a belt which is cool but really not practical for the weight if you have three mags in and a pistol on. which leads me to the pistol holster. its small and simple fits snug. i will say if you have a tactical or bigger this probably isnt the product for you. fits maybe glock 17 or xd 4"" youll just have to wear it in a little. all and all not bad"
1,Poor quality & incorrect size,"Very dissapointed when I received this poster. It is NOT 20"" X 16"" so it does not fit the 20"" X 16"" frame I purchased for it. This poster is actually 13"" X 18.5"" which is considerably smaller than represented, and does not fit in a standard frame or mat size. Also, the print quality is very poor, as it appears to be printed on an inkjet printer with a low ink cartridge with each advancement line visable. I've seen better quality on my desktop printer.I have phoned the number on the packing slip, and got a recorded message which did not identify who I had called, but I left a message anyway, hoping for a return call."
4,it worked for me but ...,"I had a bad morphology problem (67%) , took these pills and my wife is 4 months pregnant now.Don't know if it is thanks to them or to the multivitamins , omega 3 , less coffee, chinese pills ..."
4,Thackery diversity display,Demonstrates his extraordinary talent and a wide diversity of song styles...personally prefer his live shows but nice overview for those unaware of his abilities
2,Hated it.,This book is only good if you have a basic understanding of fighter planes and their weapons and instruments.
3,The Barbara Randolph collection,"The only single I recall from Barbara was a cover version ofthe 4 Tops "" I got a feeling"". I did not realize that she was a formermember of the Platters from the 50s. There are some great covers ofmotown songs here. ""Chained"" ,with Stevie Wonder on harmonica. ""What's easy for two"" and the unlikely version of Jr Walker's ""Road Runner"".These sessions sound like they where recorded with the generic motownband from LA ,so I can not recomend it.This cd is only for the die hard motown fan."
2,Pointy. Nuff said.,"The bra is relatively comfortable (for an underwire bra), and seems to be well made. However, unlike in the photo, the cups created an unnatural pointy shape. I know my correct size... Either these bras are sized wrong or they're just oddly shaped."
2,Their weakest album,"Released in 1984, this would be America's last studio album for a decade. America uses a hodge-podge of producers and abandons their trademark acoustic-based pop/rock. While it works on some of the songs, I think there are more misses than hits on this album. It produced two minor hits, Special Girl and Can't Fall Asleep To A Lullaby. Best songs are Stereo, We Got All Night, and Cinderella. This is probably America's weakest effort. For hardcore America fans only."
5,Magical music....,"A CD of magical tunes from the ""cat""...plenty to love here including Eliades Ochoa! I don't speak any Spanish and ADORE this CD - have for over 15yrs!"
4,Great Buckle,"This holder works very well. All of my zippos and the few knockoffs I have fit snugly into the holder, and are easy to remove when fire is needed. When sitting, the edge tends to poke into stomach, which kind of sucks but isn't really noticeable unless you're really fat I guess. Durable and wonderfully kitschy,"
2,Worse than the first,"I wasn't crazy about the firstStar Wars: Dark Empire Trilogy HC (Star Wars (Dark Horse)), but thought it had some redeeming value. By contrast,Star Wars: Dark Empire II 2nd Editionis just bad. The main villains are a bunch of Dark Jedi working for Palpatine who can't seem to do anything right. There really isn't much of a plot. The worst part is the Galaxy Gun. If you're sick of super-duper weapons, you'll hate the plot device. The Galaxy Gun can just fire a single missile and take out any planet. It makes being a dictator all the easier. But it's also pretty unrealistic and silly. After all, if such a weapon were possible Star Wars, why wouldn't anybody else build one? Rather than conquer the galaxy, why not just destroy any planet that puts up any resistance? And why didn't Palpatine use the Galaxy Gun to destroy Mon Calamari? Unfortunately, superweapons in the Star Wars universe have become a substitute for a good plot and character development."
3,Put the tape down and back away slowly...Again,"This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5 hours). Okay, I should have known better from the previous book, but I am a glutton for punishment. Again, good audio, great special effects, excellent music score. Lousy story line. The only value I found with this book is that it explains a few of the things that happen between the Thrawn series and the Jedi Acadamy series. I was probably mistaken in my last review about the over-editing, this just appears to be so-so writing. Choppy story line, poor plot. Overly powerful jedi, under powered dark-jedi (rediculous is the word I was thinking). Two-second love interest...no, really! Talk about your flash in the pan! Consider carefully before buying this audio book!"
3,Nice Purchase,"It's a stuffed animal - what can be said? Soft, cute, and appears durable. Educational if the child delves into information about the meerkat. Reasonably priced."
1,"Might work for forward-facing, but it is useless for rear-facing","I bought this shade to use on my rear-facing Radian, to block some of the sun that shines in my nephew's face when he is in the seat. It is useless. Because only the top is solidly colored, and the sides are mesh, it doesn't block any of the sun.I tried it on my Radian, my Avenue, and my mom's Boulevard. It didn't work for any of those seats."
4,Great reading,"Amazingly researched biography of a (bad) icon of New York's skyline. The only drawback is the overly academic, detached tone which lessens the thesis that the Pan Am assisted in the fall of the modernist regime. In any case, this is a must read simply for the story of how a big building gets built in a complicated urban environment."
5,the children,"This movie rocks. I agree with everone else this movie is creepy and the last time i saw it was when i was 10. If your looking for the same movie your not alone. I would like to see the movie on dvd. Great film. I'm a big fan of horror films and this film falls along all the great classics like halloween, friday the 13, village of the damned, ect...."
4,Creepy!,"My mom took me to see this movie in 1980 (when I was 5 yearsold!) and I've remembered it ever since. My favorite bit was theending, which I won't give away, but those who have seen it will know exactly what I'm talking about! If you like ""creepy kid"" movies, you'll love this one! I wish someone would re-release it on DVD... Anchor Bay, perhaps?"
3,Ridiculous Yet Fun,"You could call this film a guilty pleasure. The film is so bad it is rather watchable. A group of kids pass through a radiation leak while on their school bus and become mindless, black-fingernailed killers who burn their victims (mostly parents and family) upon embracing them. The townsfolk wander around wondering what the heck is going on. While the film as a whole is rather poorly made and acted, it should sustain interest. If you notice how much the music sounds like ""Friday the 13th"", you're right. This film has the same composer, not to mention the same director of photography."
2,A Dizzying Disappointment,"Abe Lincoln: Vamp Hunter is a hot mess of a film that isn't frightening enough to be classified as horror, funny enough (at least not intentionally) to be a comedy, nor thought provoking enough to be a satire. The characters serve merely to support the action, which in turn functions entirely as a structure for the effects (which, along with the sets and costuming, are rather good). Somewhere in the midst of watching it I got a craving for Gone With the Wind, which made me realize how fantastic a vampire Scarlett O'Hara would have been. Now that is a movie (and book) I would love to get my hands on."
4,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"A surprisingly good watch! Sure, it's a leap of faith ... but if you're willing to take it, you're in for some fun. A cult classic."
3,"Yeah, not that great with bad history lesson","This movie was not that great at all. The best parts are probably in the trailers, and teasers. It was okay for old time vampire vs. human action. But some of the weapons like his Axe was way over technical for the age, as was his sudden ability to take out a 20"" diameter tree with one swing. Also the story line was a bit much, with a bad history lesson. I will not purchase it or recommend to friends and family other then a redbox $1.00 rental when you have seen everything else good to see."
2,The book is better,I always like to read the book before I watch a movie. This is one time I wish I hadn't. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more had I watched it first.
3,I'm kinda on the fence,"This movie does have entertaining moments. I was happy with the cast they chose, although I'm not sure how much the younger Lincoln actually looked anything like the real young Lincoln. If you are expecting a silly vampire film based on an interesting plot, that is what you will get from this movie. If you are a history buff like me and your family talks you into watching this movie like mine did, you will complain from beginning to end. Overall it was silly, relatively cheap entertainment that I wouldn't watch again, but I was actually happy in some twisted way that I got to see."
4,Never Knew,"Very well done movie in characters, acting, effects. I normally don't like vampire or zombie movies but this one pulled it off. Was wondering why they chose Abraham Lincoln, but is a great way to make him cool all over again! If you want to see some super axe swing'n moves and be reminded the words of our founding fathers, it's all there."
1,Awful,"Read the book, this movie was awful and did nothing to help the book. The book was outstanding but the movie was hidious."
1,UltraViolet Digital Download is a JOKE,"The ""digital copy"" included with this purchase is BS. It can only be played and viewed using UltraViolet's proprietary player. Essentially, worthless. Fox needs to get in the game and stop with the UltraViolet CRAP."
3,I love this move! Why doesn't my Digital Copy work?,"I bought and paid for this Blu-Ray because it was great and it had a Digital Copy. Upon attempting to download it into my iTunes I find that the code is invalid, so my product therefore is incomplete. That is why I gave it a 3 star rating."
4,Another side of Abraham Lincoln,"This movie is a rousing action adventure based loosely around the life of Abraham Lincoln. I am not sure I like using our historical figures in this fashion, but I have to admit that this was well done and I enjoyed it."
2,"Rent, don't buy","If you are intrigued after the reviews and watching the trailer, rent don't buy, the fact that it was a $1.50 I'm not upset, had I rented from blockbusters, I would have given it only 1 star.The plot is weak, acting marginal with ok action.Looking for entertainment, I would recommend any of the other 3 movies I've watched this week over this, Lawless, The Hunger Games or Trouble with the Curve"
4,Good mash up!,"Interesting take on vampires and Lincoln. Good movie. I would recommend this movie. I plan on watching it again, soon."
4,Honest Abe against the vampires!,"I can tell you for sure that this movie is certainly better than Abraham Lincoln vs. the Zombies. This movies special effects and movie quality are comparable to Sherlock Holmes. This movie also has a small amount of scenes that drag. Overall, it is very entertaining and it was great to see the historical figure in a would be vampire action film. It's worth the viewing and the purchase. This movie has some great action scenes, especially the ones where Abe uses that famous cherry tree ax to take out vampires.If you're looking to see a movie that is really very well written and keeps you engrossed from start to finish, definitely get this movie. Also, I did not purchase the HD version but regular Amazon instant video and the movie is still amazing!Final thoughts, this is really just a great movie with great actors. A must see for honest Abe fans!"
3,I wanted to like it,"Thought this movie might be entertaining, but after half an hour I had to stop. Based on what I saw, I'd give it a 2-star rating but I bumped it up to 3 stars deciding that I probably just didn't give it enough time. I'm sad to say that in the case of this film, I'm one of those people that 'just doesn't get it.'"
4,Lincoln a Vampire slayer??,"Ok the wife and I were just sitting around with nothing to do. We came across this movie and after viewing the trailer thought, why not. We gave it a chance and we really enjoyed it. Still months after, it still comes up in our conversations and makes us laugh. Good movie, good effects....a must see for any horror fan."
4,Was worth a watch,"Before I say anything else, I will say that I did enjoy this movie! It certainly wasn't a favorite or something that I plan to watch again, but I would tell anyone who was interested in seeing it to do so. The action was pretty over the top at points, but I believe that's what they were going for. If they wanted realistic the movie would have been a drag! The movie also jumped from scene to scene quite haphazardly, and to me, didn't flow as well as it could have. Really, those are my only two complaints.The acting was well done, it wasn't too much gore, wasn't awful amounts of nudity (which the beginning will have you expecting), and it kept you on your toes wondering what would happen next. If you take the time to watch it I hope you don't take it too seriously and that you enjoy it!"
3,Good action flick,"A good action movie. Not much more, I liked the concept but the plot is noting that great. I would still recommend it."
2,Meh,"Went in with low expectations and came away with - ""eh, it could have been worse.""Just a meh movie."
2,Meh,Somehow the book was better. It seemed to be missing some of the elements that make the book so interesting.
1,meh,"I tend to like bad movies, as long as they can entertain me for the length, its all good. But I found myself just not paying any attention at all throughout this movie. It was just boring. I had higher hopes."
1,What a POS,"Ok, so I like Abraham Lincoln and I like fantasy and vampires.... so I thought what the heck I'll give this a try. So let me start with the good and let the s**t roll down hill. The graphics with this movie were good (with the exception of a few) and the character in the beginning was built up well... then it started getting far fetched (even for a fiction film). Things started to get way too over done and then they decided to push the limits some more. They could have inserted a few tag lines from Terminator and it would have fit in perfect; that's how misplaced some of the story was. Then they ended it all with a spin ( and let me give you a hint... this president rhymes with yo mama)."
2,Checked it out on a whim,"I didn't reallly enjoy this movie. Not really a vampire movie kind of guy, but like Lincoln so I thought I would check it out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except those that like vampire movies."
2,not as good as the hype,"was ok just expected more, not enough action and story line was a bit off. Glad I did not spend the money at the theatre to see it"
4,"It's no Van Helsing, but it's close","This was an excellent vampire movie. I read reviews that said it's not close to the book...who cares? This movie was action packed, plausable (as plausable as a vampire movie can be), and very well done. I plan on adding this to my collection right next to Van Helsing and Underworld."
4,Good Story! Enjoyed it!,"This was a fun, action filled vampire story. I don't know why it received such mediocre reviews. I thought it was a fun story with good action, special effects and I liked the portrayal of Abe Lincoln. Good fun."
1,Awesome Book--Horrible Movie,"The book was incredible and one of the best I have read in years. I was really looking forward to the movie---what a disappointment. I know movies and books are never the same, but I cannot imagine a worse job. If you read the book, skip the movie. If you saw the movie -- you have to read the book. I just hope they do not make a movie of Unholy Night."
1,Horrible!,"Since it is almost Halloween I was really hoping for a good horror movie. I was very disappointed. The movie just doesn't work. The vampires are OK but I guess I am used to ""The Walking Dead"" zombies to be scared. I dozed off several times and never watched the ending. I can not recommend this movie at all."
2,Ok Movie,"I bought this movie after reading the book. I know this is what everyone says, but the book is much better. I am a history nut so although I did enjoy the movie, it was really cheesy, and something that I will only watch once."
2,ok movie,We knew it would be cheesy when we ordered it but it was filmed down here. Film did not have enough to give it the 3rd star.
3,"Entertaining, but could have been better.","I read the book and was looking forward to this movie. But it does disappoint. The only similarities between the movie and the book are Abe and the title.Abe was a busy man, lawyer, slayer and President. And he found time to free the slaves.Decent action, but the story is somewhat long and drawn out."
4,I Didn't Want to Like It,"Firstly the movie felt like it was taking place in the mid to late 1800's. As well as putting you in the setting, it masterfully wove a secret and realistic (for a vampire movie) battle with the Southern Vampire forces into the life and times of Lincoln and his struggle to free the slaves and reunite the nation. It had beautifully choreographed action scenes and some decent acting all around. When I heard of the ridiculous premise of this movie I avoided it. When I finally broke down and watched it I didn't want to like it. Despite my preconceived notions and prejudices I couldn't help but be entertained from start to finish. Well worth the watch for the action fan, vampire aficionado, and maybe even the history buff looking for a smile."
4,"Entertaining, and different","I kind of liked this movie. It wasn't as good as it could have been, but it wasn't bad, either. Kind of different watching one of our greatest Presidents going around swinging an axe fighting vampires...WOW! Who knew, that a movie could actually make Abe Lincoln kind of sexy. This was great watching him learn how to swing his axe because he wasn't much of a gunfighter, but he sure knew how to split logs. The action sequences were great, I loved watching him swinging his way through that railroad car and through the White House, kicking some serious vampire butt, it makes me so glad that he became our President because now the truth can be told. Abe Lincoln saved the World from being taking over by an army of Vampires! Loved it!"
3,Just enjoy - it's not meant to be serious,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter had really, really bad reviews but I still wanted to see it and I am glad I did. This was not a film that was ever meant to be taken seriously and how could you when Abraham Lincoln and the word 'vampire' appear together in the title?! Anyway, it turned out to be hugely enjoyable and great fun. Fast paced, well acted, great action and special effects and with some lovely moments too. It works especially well because it is played absolutely straight-faced but is obviously tongue in cheek!! However, it is best viewed in 2D.What makes it even more delicious is that there are now some totally baffled Americans out there who think it really is 'the true story of America's 16th president'!!!I am wheedling to get it as an xmas prezzie!!"
4,Great movie,Great action movie and actors. The characters are well rounded and the plot flowed. I would like to see a sequel to this.
4,"Worth the money, a little too blown up","I heard this was a great movie so I couldn't wait to watch, wasn't too bad seem they scrambled to find the ending to the movie a little abruptly, to keep it within time constaints and almost recked the movie."
2,Pretty bad,Movie was pretty silly. We considered turning it off without watching the end. That's a sure sign that it's not very good.
4,Interesting...,To say the least! Decent take on Abe Lincoln and the time frame he was alive. Definitely would watch again and recommend to friends.
1,Don't wast your money,"I usually like stories that take a creative license with history but this movie missed on all cylinders. Bad script, bad acting, terrible plot. There were a lot of unusual action sceans but overall the movie is amost unwatchable."
2,B Minus movie,"Really more of a solid 'C', absurd and ridiculous but for this gem of a quote: ""Man has enslaved each other since they invented gods to forgive them for doing it"". It would have earned an A+ if good old Abe had exterminated the Twilight twits and trampires...Good thing we only spent $2.99 to stream it."
5,Better than expected,It was way better than I expected. I now regret not going to see it in theaters. It's a must see.
1,dumb,waste of money dont buy this. dull predictable and waste of my cash. seven more words are required to publish this review.
2,What??,"Don't watch it unless you are desperate and really sick of the food network. Sorry but you just can't keep doing this over and over there was absolutly nothing original in this movie. Can't think of anyone to recomend it to, it would be unkind."
3,okay 3d but stale movie.,not the greatest 3d but still worth it. story seems to drag on and i found myself not wanting to finish movie.
1,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Blue-Ray,"I think some of these DVD/Blu-Ray manufacturers are pricing their product out of the market. Why is this disk $30. It's only 1 disk, there's no DVD in the package, there's not even a digital copy. Nothing extra yet they're asking a premium price for the product. The pricing on DVDs & Blue-Ray disks is getting totally ridiculous."
1,What a peice!,"Wow, of you have 2 hours to waste, do it with any other movie! Everyone associated with this film should take a nice long look at their life to figure out where it went wrong. This movie is worse than AIDS. Sorry to AIDS for the insult!"
1,Waste of good material,"This movie was reduced to nearly nothing remotely resembling the book. This would have been so much better had they made 3 movies out of it - there is so much material not even touched in this movie it is ridiculous.Not everyone in the 19th century was a Ninja/Circus acrobat, but you'd think so after watching this crud. There's so much acrobatic crap in this movie I seriously doubt Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan could pull it off. Read the book instead."
3,Strange,The cover photo is misleading and I don't understand why they used the image of a very beloved former president.
1,What can I say?,This move was just about exactly as stupid as you think it will be based on the premise. Go take a 2 hour nap instead - this isn't worth the time it takes to sit through it.
3,better than expected,"i assumed it would be absolutely terrible, i mean ole abe hunting vampires?! but i still wanted to see it. glad i did! much better than i expected. loved how it intergrated known facts about abe and his fam, but flipped it to make it ""fit"" the story line. overall a good movie"
3,Far Fetched Lincoln plot,Silly movie - Lincoln would probably turn over in his grave to see what they did to him. Could have been about any vampire. Kept my attention only because I like movies like this but it was a bit far fetched.
2,Not worth it,"If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed. The only thing in common is the title, which is odd because the author of the book wrote the screenplay."
2,Unmemorable,"I didn't remember much about it the next day, which doesn't really say much for it. I found the premise silly and the plot dull."
2,The trailer was better.,"Not what I expected. Sort of got bogged down in the political side of Abe, but the vampire action and cinematography were great!"
2,Wait until its free.,"Jus not my cup of tea, The star has no resemblance to Abe. The plot was none existent. I gave 2 stars because my wife kinda liked it."
1,Never Showed Up,"I didn't hate it because I didn't see it, but one star was the least of the choices. For some reason it never showed up in my video library. It was only a rental and I am only out $1.99. Don't know what happened????"
4,better then shaknight 3d,this was better then most dont want to give any details so i well leave it at that...it was worth buyin
1,poor 3d not full screen,"this movie is the same as previous movies poor 3d and not full screen , i would not recommennd this movie"
2,Why?,"Absolute mediocrity. The idea that the vampires kept slaves for food was interesting but really, it's just a vampire hunter movie. The guys good with an axe, I'll give him that. No, I won't. It's just stupid. Two stars for good effects and being well made."
3,Slow reading,The book was slow and somewhat boring despite the subject. It is a young adult book and reads young. If someone asked my opinion I'd say it was ok.
3,Watch to pass the time,It was an o.k. movie. My daughter and I like vampire shows it was entertaining enough. Would not watch again.
4,"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter","Better than expected. It tied in historical events which made it more plausible. It was well filmed and well acted. Overall, it was a very entertaining."
3,Just don't take it seriously.,"This very strange and crazy story about Lincoln hunting and killing vampires, except for one that he befriends, is clearly not meant to be taken seriously. Also, you will find the friendly vampire's haircut anachronistic, and the sequence with the horse stampede is not believable or even photographed well."
2,Talk About a Moment of Weakness,"I'm not a horror fan, but in the spirit of Halloween, I gave Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter a try. After seeing the movie, I wondered how this was a theatrical release rather than a straight-to-video offering. I am told Abraham Lincoln: Zombie Hunter had a much better story. Somehow, I don't think it will be long before students start incorporating fictional elements of ALVH into their reports on Abraham Lincoln. I'm glad I don't teach American History."
4,Too much fun,"OK, it won't be nominated for an Oscar or an Emmy, but it was a lot of fun. There is no attempt at historical correctness, or deep meaning. It was the story of a US president kicking a55 and taking names. There actually was a fair amount of character development between the ax murders and the stakings. Great ""B movie"" stuff."
3,Was really excited about this movie...,"As the title says I was really excited to see this movie, then I watched it. Perhaps my excitement was tilted toward a slightly more action packed adventure, instead of a mildly action packed historical drama. It was just okay."
1,Not for me,This was by far the most painful 105 minutes I've subjected myself to in a few years. I had a feeling I wouldn't like this but the sudden slow motion action shots were but one thing that made this unbearable to watch. I'll never get that time back again.
4,Different Twist on History That is Well Written and Directed,"I am not the type who likes any of the vampire movies.And I also do not like gory movies.This movie has vampires and lots of killings.So why did I like it?The vampire scenes throught the movie, and the killings, are done in a more subtle way than depicted in most modern movies.At the same time the special effects for the other scenes in the movie were top shelf.I also felt caught up in the twist on history to depict how Lincoln fought the vampires and how they effected everything during his life.The director did a great job in putting the story together on film."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,I had no expectations going into this movie. With the exception of a couple of CG overdoses this movie does no wrong. It's extremely entertining and an imaginative twist on history. It's definitely worth a watch.
5,Enjoy- it's not real!,"I was very hesitant to watch this just based on the title alone. After watching the trailer, I figured- ""why not?""- I've always liked Tim Burton so it couldn't hurt to give it a try... You obviously can't take the movie seriously because it is a fictional twist on Abraham Lincoln but nevertheless it is still intriguing and entertaining. The incorporation of the civil war history and Abraham Lincolns political career brought even more excitement to the story. I would highly recommend it :)"
3,"Good Movie, Terrible 3D","The movie was entertaining and an interesting twist to real life events. However, do not spend the extra money for the Blu-ray 3D version of this movie. The 3D was hardly noticeable and somewhat distracting at times. I wish I would have known this ahead of time. Stick with the standard Blu-ray (or even DVD) version, sit back and enjoy the movie.Movie = 4 Stars3D Effects = 2 StarsTotal = 3 Stars"
1,This movie is a waste of money and time!,"I hated it. It was boring, poorly done, and it had a stupid plot. I should have guessed from the title..."
1,My dear friends!,"Some of the favorable reviews seemed a little confused as to what truth is. Speculation is not truth. This book is fiction like the Da Vinci Code, without excitement or RESEARCH. Or very limited research.Oh, and by the way (to those who think that I am a Merton worshiper), I very much doubt that anyone worships Merton (for obvious reasons)."
1,Leave the Cubans alone,"I read this to study history of American propaganda, and I watch new Kevin Costner film. It is shameful that the attack on Cuban sovreignity is called heroism by the Kennedy clan. Robert Kennedy and his brother 'Jack' are both good friends of Marilyn Monroe and they shared a belief in the Monroe Doctrine that both America's - North and South - belong to the USA sphere of influence, but Latin American peoples are not slaves of America. If they wish to invite Soviet friends to place missiles in Cuba this is their freedom. Robert writes like a politician. He doesn't break the truth or tell lies, but he bends the truth so much it cries to be broken. These guys make your President Nixon look good. Kennedy was stupid to challenge Russians for a few missiles. Only a few years later intercontinental missiles could reach America from Kazakstan. What a foolish gambler, this Las Vegas Disneyland President was!"
1,Junk!,"I had purchased a pump and balloons similar to this one from somewhere else. I bought two of these to have more pumps and balloons for a birthday party, as they are so much fun. I took the first pump and on the first try, the back popped right off. I snapped it back on, but it just would not hold up to the pressure. I realized that it was defective and tried the the other new pump. This time the handle pulled right off! These are absolute junk! I returned both for a refund. Amazon should not sell these again until the quality can be improved."
2,LEAKS!,"Hi there-we've had our Danby countertop dishwasher for 1.5 years and have STRUGGLED with the unit leaking through the front window. We followed directions given by other folks having similar problems and attempted to seal the window/leaks but after three times, we are finally throwing this dishwasher out. Loved having it when it worked because we have two small boys and it was endlessly convenient for our family. I think the quality of the unit is poor and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a countertop dishwasher. If anyone has information on a good quality, reliable countertop diswasher, let us know as we are looking for a new one."
2,Great until this latest serious leak!,"I've loved this dishwasher due to it's size and price. ( The only other countertop dishwasher available is too tall to fit under cabinets) However, even though I only use it every two or three days, before 6 months water was coming out of the window seals. I took the window out myself and super glued the seals and window in place which luckily worked out great. The seal around the door came loose and again, luckily I was able to fix that. Sadly, almost 2 years after purchasing my dishwasher, it began to leak from underneath. The cost to diagnose and repair would come too close to my original purchase price, so It's a goner! I really expected to get longer usage time from it since I never used the sani-mode and usually ran it on the shortest wash cycle, combined with using it 2-3 times per week. If I had used it everyday with full wash and sani-mode, I expect this little dishwasher would never have seen it's first birthday. DANBY....Please step up your game!!!"
1,waste money!,"It's not what it is described! It was very hard to stick the protector to the screen. It's not really anti-glare. With the protector, the Image & text on the screen are not sharp.I try to return this item to BoxWave, but found that""Any ClearTouch products with its plastic backing sheets removed or re-attached at any time are not returnable"" ([...])Don't waste money on this product!ps: this is the first time I try to return a product bought from Amazon."
2,Very difficult to get on...,"This product was extremely difficult to get on. I had another friend tell me that he had 2 other sets of hands to get it on and even that took some work. Maybe this isn't a review of the product actually working because I couldn't get it on properly, but it is more of a warning that you should be prepared to have some extra hands to help you get this product onto your product. Even then, it will not look perfect on the device."
2,Frustrating and disappointing,- Expensive- Extremely difficult to get on without flaws underneath- Does not actually do very much
1,Anti-glare screen protector,This product did not do what it claimed to do. It was impossible to clean between the glass and the film.
2,I totally disagree!,As a freshman at Santa Catalina School I felt nervous being in a new school but so does everyone who is just beginning school. If Ms. King couldn't deal with it then obviously she wasn't Catalina material but she shouldn't be bitter about it. Just because this school wasn't right for her it doesn't mean its a bad school.
2,Interesting Read if You've Been There,"I too am a graduate of Santa Catalina. While I found it facinating because I have been there and done that, the book is not well written. It reads like a first draft and far more could have been examined and explored. I am also curious as to how this book classifies as non-fiction, beside the main character, June Smith, all the teachers, nuns, students, school, and buildings exist in real life. Names were not changed."
1,Just to let you know...,"no, not all catalina students were required to write a trashy review of jane king's novel.the reviews show how much ms. king's book angered catalina students. if students would take the time to write a review of her book, defending their school, that shows something about catalina. i don't think that ms. king should have written a book bad mouthing catalina because of her experience. everybody has the right school out there for themselves, and maybe catalina wasn't right for ms. king, but i know it's a great school in my opinion."
3,not what I expected,"If the other people reviewing this book had actually read it instead of jumping to the inane conclusion that it is horribly insulting, they would have seen how mild and harmless this book is. I expected a far more scathing account of the Catalina experience . . . what I found was an almost boring description of the school. Like most other readers, I went to Catalina. I do not feel like I need to stand up for it in this reveiw, SC can do that by itself. As far as quality goes, there is a reason there are so few copies of this book in print. It is full of lengthy descriptions of the school, the uniforms, and the Monterey Peninsula. Ms. King would have gotten a greater amount of readers had she been tougher on the administration. Besides calling the nuns fat and mean, she seems fairly content, while perhaps bored, with the school. I would not have been so nice, had I been publishing a book on this subject."
1,Not Quite Good,"After skimming over the other reviews of this novel, it was quite apparent that Ms. King's opinion of Santa Catalina is, on the whole, quite the opposite of most of the school's students and alumnae. I am sure that many people exceedingly enjoy Catalina, but Ms. King is entitled to her own opinion and therefore it is extremely excessive of the school's graduates and pupils to continue to write reviews insulting the book merely based on difference in perspective. What the reviewers should focus on is the writing ability of the author: it is that of an amateur and deserves little or no praise. If I were at all connected with Santa Catalina, I would be ashamed that the school was being represented in such a disgusting way. Ms. King obviously did not benefit from the academics at Santa Catalina. Along with its repulsive composure, the material is down right stupid and plot and characters are extremely dull."
4,Portable Gun Rest,"I have not used it yet, but I plan on carrying it around when I hunt in case the gun rest is too low. I filled it with 50/50 diatamacous earth (DE) and sand. This made is lighter, but still stable for a rest."
1,Pillow is ok,"I bought this pillow for my wife based on the reviews here. It arrived as expected but tore in a weak point, I tried to contact AB Marketers with not reply. I read through the details again and they will not accept returns or exchanges.UPDATE:AB Marketers did contact me about a month later and offered a full refund for the pillow. The explained they will not accept returns but if it was defective that they would. This makes sence I think there is some law agenst returns of pillows."
1,"not funny, only disgusting","I am disappointed to find this item being offered as Humorous - real bestial behavior actually occurs and injures goats & sheep, often fatally. I recommend this item be discontinued and destroyed, written off as a BAD idea."
3,Program is to general,"First of all, the on/off switch is a two way, a true on/off and aten second on/off, can't understand whySecond , you must tell it where you are ( meaning what state your in)what's up with that...and if you don't, all you will get is a hourglass and then nothing...be aware...Third.. waiting time to find sat's is almost to much to handleFourth.. it a great unit...after you figure how it works"
3,"Ahhh- Its ok,But not Great....","The mount sucks, its wobbly and no adjustment to tighten it. Can not buy anything as far as a gravity mount or anything of the sort because of the unconditional way it attaches to the unit. Nav itself is ok, but again not great, cant type in a directory by name, and have it search.You can only scroll thru what is in the unit itself, which kinda sucks.All in all, wish i would of bought something else, oh and by the way, dont buy from RCS Experience, unless you want to wait 2 weeks to recieve your product, and have rude comments sent to you, if you ask about the 3-5 day shipping estimate........"
2,They should now be called NaviGONE.,"I bought my Navigon GPS (7200T) because it had the most features for the lowest price. That still holds true. Very nice unit- attractive and works well, too. Recently, I wanted to update the maps, but there was no Freshmaps Activation card in the box from Amazon. You need the code on that card to get updates. So, I emailed Navigon support for assistance. They sent the following:'Thank you for your inquiry. Accessories, map material and content are not available in North America through NAVIGON. Unfortunately we don't have information concerning the availability of these products at other major retail shops.'As has been noted in the posted comments, and which I discovered too late, Navigon is pulling out of the North America market. Beware of this major change, and buy accordingly. They should now be called NaviGONE."
1,This item with beautiful looking but without brain - drive you crazy,"This is a really stupid, helpless, not update, concret brain, not easy to use item. it drive you crazy. Look pretty but a it disappoint you for sure. I try it for a month, it always provide wrong information and direction, insist on his own route suggestion even after 50 miles away, he still want you back to his original route until last half mile you almost get destination yourself. CRAZY....it never happened to my other GPS system. TERRIBLE PRODUCT."
4,My Navigon 7100,"Navigon 7100 4.3-Inch Wide screen Portable GPS NavigatorI loved the product ,only problem I can't find funeral homes,sometimes it takes you in a round about way"
3,"OK, but needs a lot of work","I was also one of the ones that got the 2gig card instead of the 4. Navigon can't get their story strait on this one. Online reports seem to imply they are sending a new 4gig card to some users who call techsupport, others they are not. Hopefully the will step up to the plate and fix this for those of us who showed early support to the product.The Text2Speech is hit and miss, sometimes it seems to work well speaking street names, others it does not. (Even on the same roads, strange....)The graphics and voice command are good, but there are some issues with the 7100 that need to be handled by Navigon. There is some very strange routing with the unit. No auto ""Day/Night"" mode (a MUST have). POIs really need to be updated. The low end Mio's have a more complete set.Navigon where are you!!!"
5,Excellent GPS,The Navigon series is an excellent GPS product with the new technology that gives a realistic view to major road signage. The 7100 has every technology imaginable on a midend GPS system. I highly recommend it.
1,Poor route routing,The 7100 does not calculate the shortest time route and takes you on round about routes. This has happened to me on more than one occasion while using the system on very familiar routes using different settings. When the unit was set for fast route which means fast roads not fastest time it took me on a route that was not the shortest time route. If you set it for shortest route it will provide a shortest distance route which may not be the shortest time route.I called Navigon and spoke to their technical support and general support people. They were unable to provide a solution to correct the problem.This was very disappointing since I know Navigon is a very good and respected supplier of GPS systems in Europe. To bad they did not wring out all the kinks before rolling this out in North America.Amazon is allowing me to return the item.
2,Disappointing,"I REALLY wanted to like this GPS (replaced an older Garmin). It is so sleek and visually appealing. But I couldn't get past its limitations and have returned it. I got frustrated every time I used it.Pros: beautiful, quick to get satellite, worked in my house(!), good POI info.Cons: Windshield mount is terrible! Very difficult to use, kept falling off. No other accessories are available at this time. I could have lived with that (I suppose), if the map software had been more user-friendly. When I wanted to look at the map, rather than be ""routed"", it was difficult and not very helpful - street names would disappear when you get the view widened enough to see more than your immediate surroundings. Some of the routing was strange also, and the voice prompt didn't start you out.I wanted to love it, but it is just not the device for me."
1,Very Poor GPS Receiver,"I have bought this unit after watching an ad on TV showing that it have a reality mode where you will see real views while driving. I decided to buy it but then returned it 2 days later after navigating with it on 3 trips. I was disappointed by the POIs which are VERY few as I was comparing it to my son Mio, the battery life was very short despite that I charged it all night through, and there was no reality view in NC as advertised, and the navigation was not accurate. I returned it back and bought the Mio C720t which have a fantastic database of 12 million POIs, VERY Accurate Navigator, a camera that register the location and the navigator can take you back to the same location, and a LOT more of bells and whistles. Sorry Navigon, your unit looks fantastic, but functions poorly."
2,Disappointed,"The first two seasons, except for last episode, were excellent. The last episode was so vague and stupid that I was very excited to be able to get 3rd and 4th season to clarify what happen. But they turned out to be worse. I would not recommend wasting money on 3rd and 4th season. Seemed to go down hill once Aunt Elizabeth disappeared."
4,Entertaining!,"Too much effort has been put into providing space in the shortened series episodes for all of Jame's plot. This makes for dead end plot lines, incomprehensible scenes, comprehensible scenes which no longer advance the plot. Clearly if one tries to adapt a complex novel such as one by the later James one must cut to the bone or saw off all the branches of the tree leaving only the solid trunk. Nevertheless, seen without concern to how faithful the film is to the original book, it is an entertaining hour and forty minutes. This episode marks the emergence of the humane, decent Dalgleish as distinct from the almost pure copper we saw earlier on. There is a parallel between his relationship to his lady-love and the murder victims to those who loved him. Aside from this, it is best to stick to the main line and not get too involved as to be frustrated by the seeming digressionsShould be pleasing to all James fans and to the general listener to PBS or BBC Mysteries"
3,pickin george strait 1 & 2,"The music was good but, it kept cutting in and out. There was no words to the music You should let the words go along with the music. I think it would sound much better."
2,Revenge of the Frogman,"Seeing this movie around 2 in the morning on Bravo, it caught my interest for a little while. But, the most intresting thing, besides seeing Roy Scheider make an enemy tower combust with the aid of keresone, was his amazing ability to look like a toad. The main reason was his mouth, I guess. How could anyone take this man seriously in combat??? I would probably bust out laughing when encountered with his amphibian-like physique. It was and ok movie, but like a lot of other ones I have seen."
4,Replay,i think it's a cool cd .... it really shows how much they've grown up since us against the world. it also has to do with a teenagers life and what there going through.
4,better cd then kell y clarkson,this cd is the bomb i love this cd so much i can hear it every day of my life and this cd is so better (...)
5,THIS CD'S THEIR BEST ONE YET!,"I absolutely love this CD better than the 1st one. Play's 1st CD had too less songs in it, even though I liked Cinderella. My absolute favorite song in this CD is Whole Again. Well, I Must Not Chase the Boys comes in really close because I like the tune and lyrics to both songs, but Whole Again's been on my boombox for 5 days, since the CD came out and I can't turn it off!! I recommend Play to anyone who likes girl bands, R&B, and pop. Play's voices blend together so well that it sounds like 1 really good singer singing all of the songs!"
2,er.........,"wats up with the covers? liberty x, billy, atomic kitten? still im sure the rest of the album is ok!"
1,Not for young ears!!!!,"After the first Play CD, my daughter was excited to see Replay come out. My wife and I gave it a preview and we were extremely disappointed. I'm not quite sure if the young ladies of Play are more interested in making good music or losing their virginity. Almost every song contains innuendo and much of it is appallingly obvious.Now don't get me wrong, I realize these girls are experiencing a wide array of feelings and emotions and to sing about those feelings is fine. I have a big problem with this type of music being peddled on kiddie TV like Nickolodean.If you are a parent of a young lady under the age of 13 and you want to TRY and keep them sheltered, avoid this CD."
5,One of the best albums in the world,"this is such an amazing album. i'm a fan from yorkshire in england and i am so glad i became a play fan. my favourite songs are i must not chase the boys, 11 out of 10, girls mind, aint no mountain high enough and whole again. buy this album you wont regret it"
4,Not Bad!,"Yo this is a good c.d.I heared that Faye left the group!She had a great voice.I Must not Chase the boys:It was a good song,but I'm not sure what's it about!Honey To The bee:It was a cute song.A little chessy.JUst A little:I loved it!It so good.I like the ending.Whole Agian:Was great too.But I heared it too many times.Hot:I didn't like it at first,but now i do.It's kind of stange.They use the word Hot too much.What is love :It's great.I loved it.All the girls sang to the same time.11 out of 10:Didn't lisen to it.Let's get to the love part:I didn't like it too much.2 blocks down:Didn't lisen to it.Ain't no mountain Hight enough:Great.Faye voice is so strong.All the songs are good.Some better then others.Lisen to the clips before you buy it.Just to make sure you like it!"
5,The Greatest Jewish Writer,"For my money, Babel is the greatest Jewish writer. Kafka comes close, but he's going in a completely different direction. While Kafka couches the nightmare and loneliness of modern life in fable and fantasy, in dream and allegory, Babel serves it to us straight, covered in blood and shredded paper and feathers."
5,What a money saver this book was!,"As a first time homebuyer, Julie's book helped me understand the complex issues in shopping for the best loan as well as negotiating with the lender. Especially helpful was her overview of financing via the web. I'm looking forward to using her equity management ideas to save a bundle on my home, and am ordering her mortgage book as well."
2,Not a long shelf-life,"The battery has a very short power supply, I have been generally disappointed with this purchase."
3,Good,"I expected more from this book. It is very well illustrated an practical, but more content would make it better."
2,Very amaturish,"Start by looking at the cover. This book as so many digital ideas (not what we were looking for) but they chose such a poor image for the cover. Instead of such gimicky digital ideas, maybe Mr. Hunter and the others should have retouched the cover image. Blood shot eyes, yellow teeth, a floating eye and stray hairs will put most professional photographers out of business in less than a year. We have been in business for over 15 years and are now thinking just about anyone can write a book. Maybe we will."
2,Sound not for me to sleep with,Everyone is a bit different in what noise will help them sleep. This had good white noise but not the kind of noise that lulled me to sleep. So I will try something different.
5,Can't live without this little machine.,Best $50 I ever spent. Mine is about 8 years old and still going strong. Use it every night and it goes with us when we are away from home. I am buying one for my 4 year old granddaughter so she won't hear her baby sister in the next room at night. I highly recommend this if noises are disturbing your sleep.
3,Not loud enough to block out sounds of Big Brother!,"We bought this sound conditioner for our 7 month old baby boy. We have a 4 1/2 year that has used a white noise machine since he was born and he is a great sleeper. So we wanted to use one with our newest addition to help him sleep, but most important to block out the sounds of his Big Brother! If you are looking for something to block sound, you will not be happy with this item. If you are just looking for a smooth white noise sound, then this will be fine."
2,Not sure why its so high rated,"I guess its ok, takes awhile to get used to, you'll still hear other noises, I don't think it helps tetinitus much, after about a year mine started making a irregular vibrating sound which will drive you mad if you leave it on.Not really worth it IMO. I'm trying ear plugs now. Honestly my humidifiers sound helped me sleep much more."
1,Don't Do It,Waste of money. You'd be better off with an old radio from Salvation Army or using a free internet source like simplynoise. The makers of this product do not know what real white noise is.
1,waste of money,"you can buy :Honeywell Enviracaire HEPA Air Purifier ""or anything like it"" ..... (i have it already)it gives you better and more"
1,Didn't help,I found this sound conditioner to be more of a hindrance than help. I couldn't sleep well with it on because the sound was distracting.It was a total waste of my money.
4,good,I enjoy having a little white noise in my room because I sometimes work the overnights. Other sound machines break too easily and dont last long. This is very durable and a nice sound. It has two levels and both are a little too loud for my small room but I put a small towel over it and the level is perfect.
2,Not effective for serious noise.,"I like that the machine sounds like simple air, but it does not help if you have serious noise. I have neighbors with hardwood floors above me and I can hear everything. I was hoping to find a machine that would generate enough white noise to equal the street traffic noise I hear when I open my patio doors (it's getting cold), but it doesn't even come close. I imagine it would be useful in a smaller, quieter room. It was not effective for me, and I don't think it will be effective for masking loud noises. I used the highest setting and the sound was barely noticeable."
1,Sound is much too loud & annoying to allow sleep,"I bought this as a more portable substitute to using a box fan to help me sleep. While the noise of a box fan is soothing, the noise of this device is annoying! Not only is it too loud, even on low, but there's a very unpleasant mixture of high fan sounds and low motor sounds, as noted in other 1-star reviews. I returned it right away. I'm really puzzled why so many reviewers seem to like it. I will try one of the electronic machines next."
5,It truly works!,I don't know why this product works. But it does! I have been sleeping through the night. On the weekends it can get very noisy. I just changed the setting to the higher end of the scale and was back to sleep for the rest of the night. A great product! Thank you
5,Can't sleep without it,"I love this product and have one for every member of my family.It provides the most-perfect white noise to block out extraneous sounds while you sleep at night, or nap during the day.As a used-to-be shift worker, I can state it's the must-have for day sleeping."
5,Where have you been all my life!,"I have always needed a fan to fall asleep since I can remember,living in Maine the draft in the winter months wasn't much fun. my boyfriend didn't deal well with the draft the fan would put off. But this machine has fixed that problem and we are sleeping soundly together! I was worried it might not be loud enough to block out the noise from the tv and the garage across the street with the trucks that like to start at 2 am, but it does and I am very happy with this product!"
2,Broke Within 6 Weeks of Using,"I really liked the sound of the DOHM and it is exactly what I was looking for. I have a two year old and a baby and it really helps blend out noises. I felt I was sleeping better myself. However, I purchased it in May and it started to have a rattle sound only a couple weeks later in June. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet but I will do so and I am hoping I can get a replacement."
5,Great little machine!,I use it nightly and it helps me drown out some of the noise of apartment living (chatty neighbors) and the car noises outside. It allows you to adjust the tone of the sound to give you a range of sound from what sounds like a water fall/river rush to a deeper wind like billow. Love it.
2,Didnt work for me,"I was very surprised that this item didnt work for me with all the glowing reviews this has.I'm a very light sleeper and I was very thrilled to find this product... until I got it. Sounds a bit louder than your regular fan, but it doesnt, by any means, reduce other noises.It took me a bit to get used to the its loud noise, but when I did, I also noticed, it didnt muffle other noises. I could still hear my upstairs neighbor opening a drawer and that was a tame one.In my opinion, this products just creates a distraction from other noises, but by no means reduces them or muffles them. All the noises are still there, but is as if you have to focus on the Sleepmate noise to tune out the others, and sorry, but thats not what I need.Just returned it."
4,Works well...,I needed a quick noise blocker to avoid hearing my upstairs neighbors every move. I noticed that when I used my air conditioner I heard less sounds. But I didn't want my electricity bill to go up either.The sound conditioner works well enough to make the noises a lot more tolerable. And I sleep very well using it.
2,Broke down,"After using it for a 2 week period it stopped working, just would not switch on. The sound when it did work was not really definable enough and was in just one particular frequency, not real ""white noise"". However it did help, when it worked, that is."
5,Sleeping great,I've been sleeping really good. It has a consent sound that helps me relax. It's what I was hoping for.
1,Loud motor and was sent a used item.,"I just got this thing and there is a high pitched whinny sound that's coming from the motor. I also believe I was sent a used item, it was just in some plain generic white box. The ones in the store aren't packaged like this, so why was mine? Put's a bad taste in your mouth when you feel you've been sent a returned item from someone else.I will be shipping this back to amazon ASAP. Save your money, look for something else."
1,Can you sleep to a loud rattle?,"Tossed the thing after a few weeks, as it developed a loud rattle. It's really just a fan, and fans tend to do that after a while. With this one, there was no stopping the rattling."
4,Sound sleep,"I received this as a gift from my husband. I had nagged him for years about his snoring. We also live on a very busy and loud street, so this product has been the perfect solution! I can adjust the sound from the machine to what type of noise is irritating me that night (or day!) It took me two nights to get adjusted to the noise and to learn what worked for me, but after that I fell in love with it! I even take it with me when I travel."
5,Works great for noisy office neighbors,"I worked in a shared office space environment. Everyone on my floor has their own business and we all work out of individual offices. The guy next to me is really unbelievably loud on the phone and he's on the phone a lot. I tried this product out after some great reviews and I have to say it works pretty well. I can still hear occasional noise through it, but honestly, this guy is right on the other side of the wall from me and pretty damn loud.The white noise itself is not a distraction. I get very distracted by noise (like the neighbor) but this is no problem. I just ordered a second one for my son's bedroom. We live in a rambler and his bedroom is poorly located."
4,Good product,"It doesn't drown out ALL of the noise, but it drowns out enough to get a good night's sleep. I can no longer hear the noise of my neighbor's TV, the horns from the cars outside, or various other bumps in the night that I used to hear. Some noise does get through, but it is much less startling now. I've been sleeping like a baby ever since I've been using this product. I've found a setting that works well for me, but I could see if someone would need this to be a little louder. The wooshing noise is very soothing."
4,Sleeping easier,"I live in the country and it is so quiet that the slightest noiseprevents me from falling asleep. Unfortunately, an interstate highway crosses the valley where I live and the truck noise is very irritating at times and I need to close the windows in order to fall asleep. The Sleepmate covers the sounds completely with the sound of rushing air similar to an air conditioner and now I can leave the windows open. I use and need only the lowest setting on the Sleepmate and the pitch can be adjusted as well. The higher setting would probably mask much worse sound conditions than I have.I am pleased with the product and I recommend it. David"
2,Horrible,"I don't understand how so many rated this 5 stars. This unit is not soothing at all. In fact, it agitates me. This nothing more than a fan in a plastic housing. I've tried adjusting the airflow in every position and am unable to find a comfortable setting. I even hear the motor whirring beneath the fan sound, which distracts me even more. There is no true volume adjustment either; you can only adjust the airflow which changes the pitch. Very disappointed."
5,Restful night's sleep,From day one this little machine has helped up drown our external noises and given us back our sleep. I haven't slept this deep since prior to having kids!!!This machine is awesome!!
2,Noise machine,"I work nights and use a machine to drown out outside noise, cat noise etc. I found this machine to not be loud enough to block out these noises."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a great product. Screens out noise from partier upstairs and noises my cat makes eating, digging in litterbox, playing, etc. Also, my cat now knows that as long as the machine is on, he will get no attention, so it trained him to leave me alone when I'm sleeping!!"
4,Could be noisier,"I wish this was a little bit louder, but we kept it anyway. Good quality and still serves the purpose of giving our son some background noise while he is sleeping. It is also small enough that we travel with it as well."
5,DS or SS? We have both.,"First, we bought the dual speed machine. After some trial and error, we only use it on the higher setting. The higher speed is louder/ and masks more noise. When we decided to buy a second one, I took a chance hoping that the single speed machine would be the same as the high speed setting on the dual speed machine. It is! Just wanted to put that out there for anyone else wondering the same thing.Thanks for reading, I hope this was helpful!"
4,good product,I really like this item. I have one in my northern home and now one in my southern home. Just good white noise.
5,Love this sleep machine,"I have had a Marpac white noise machine for over twenty years. I just ordered a new one (the old one is fine) because my five-year-old granddaughter wants one in her room. I can't imagine trying to sleep without it and both my grandchildren love it. I first started using one when I worked nights many years ago and had to sleep in the day. It blocked out just enough household noise to let me sleep. Then I discoverd I also liked it during the night and have loved using one ever since. This is the basic model - just a air rush sound in two volumes. You can also make minor adjustment to the sound by turning the top a bit. It is a lovely, expensive sleep aid that seems to last forever. We've used it for newborns too and it helps them sleep through the night. I highly recommend it."
5,GREAT PRODUCT.,"I like this noise-maker very much. I had become accustomed to the window air conditioner in my bedroom which, of course, was very loud. I needed something I could use year-round. I wanted a ""mechanical"" device as opposed to a radio with nature sounds or a CD. I plug this thing into a Belkin Conserve Socket and set it for 6 hours (so it turns off in time for the wake-up alarm). I set it on ""high"" and it works quite well. I would have preferred it a little louder, but I've been using it for several months now and am very happy with it."
3,Wish it were louder,"I live in the noisiest apartment of all time and the only complaint that I have of this item is that I wish that it were louder. It doesn't really mask most of the sounds in the apartment, although it does help."
4,very pleased,"I am very happy with this product. Before this I used a sound machine with nature sounds for my daugters room (ages 5 and 2) We live on a parking lot and in the summer there is a lot of noise outside.I like the white noise much better than any other sound. It just sort of disappears into the background, and the girls sleep great!"
5,DOES THE JOB WELL-consider getting the single speed version,"This product lives up to it's positive reviews. Our infant grandson is a fairly light sleeper, and we had gone through two fans before buying this. It is a similar sound to a fan, however there is no air blowing around in the room, creating a draft and making the room cold. I would suggest to anyone considering buying this, to save some money and buy the single speed model. Other reviewers had said this as well, but I thought we might want the option of two speeds. Not needed in my opinion, for the extra $10. cost. We ALWAYS have it on the highest speed, and within that speed you can adjust the sound effect, which gives some control over the sound."
1,Marpac Sleepmate 980-A,"I just bought this machine to drown out the sound of my neighbor's loud thumps/doors closing at 3:30 a.m. Unfortunately, I am hearing impaired and can barely hear this machine. I do not recommend this machine if you are hearing impaired. It is not loud enough."
4,"Works okay, but motor whines","I'm a very light sleeper, and it doesn't take much noise to wake me or to keep me from falling asleep. I purchased the Marpac SleepMate (also known as the SoundScreen). The 980A has two speed controls.The product does make a generic ""white noise"", Playing with the two twist-controls will change the volume and also will change the type of noise to a degree. Naturally, this can also be varied by the two speed settings.The downside for me is the motor itself. It whines, and no setting would get rid of that. Since I couldn't ignore the whining sound, I returned the unit, and of course Amazon promptly refunded my entire purchase, including shipping.If a slight hum/whine doesn't bother you, then this product might meet your needs."
1,What are these good reviews all about?,"Naturally I bought this item because of all of the great reviews on here. Now that I have it and have used it, I am very, VERY confused. It does NOTHING. Every single noise can still be perfectly heard: All traffic, all neighbors, my tiny dog scratching his whiskers....everything. It does not ""fill the room"" and is, in fact, so faint, no matter how high the thing is adjusted (which the so called ""settings"" are somewhat of a joke) even right by my HEAD it makes little difference.White noise, obviously, needs to be at a certain volume to be of any use. At this rate, you may as well try and listen for your refrigerator's motor. I am totally confused by the outlandish price for what is the volume equivalent of a small fan. What else can I say? It's useless. Those who love this thing must live in the country and are hoping to drown out the sound of a distant cricket. For those of us in the big cities, this will not do."
4,Does help with sleeping with a snorer,"I bought this item because I share the bed with a snorer. Earplugs alone weren't working, but adding this noise machine to the mix has made a big difference. I'm rarely woken by snoring anymore. By itself, the machine is not be enough to block the snoring--I need the earplugs as well."
1,High-Pitched Fan Defeats Purpose,"The problem with this product is that you can hear the high pitch whine of the fan inside the unit in addition to the white noise caused by the air whooshing out of the slots. This made the noise it generates sounds more like a low power hair dryer, than a true white noise generator. For the price, you think they could have used a quieter fan."
4,Good for babies,"Is pretty good but, could be slightly louder to be great.You get what you pay for. I would say overall I like it."
4,white noise masks conversation,We have recently employed the Marpac 980a in a clinical situation. This unit seems to work very well for masking conversations in adjacent rooms. Very much worth the price!
4,A relief!,We have a newborn and this sound machine has made putting and keeping her asleep a lot easier. It helps to drown out the outside sounds while creating a soothing environment for her. I have found myself falling asleep while putting her to sleep because of this machine.
3,Works pretty well,"The machine drowns out some noise, but I wish it was louder. The footsteps from my neighbors above me are very loud & I hoped to completely drown out the noise. The machine has decreased the noise some...I would say the noise level went from a 10 to a 7. :)"
3,A little different than one I bought before,"I have another one of these exact same ones I had purchased over 5 years ago. It is identical except that my old one is louder- therefore, better in this case- than this one. I tried adjusting it every which way (the top round part, the center circle, and the hi / low options) but it cannot get near as loud as my older one."
5,sleep mate review,"Very fast delivery, and performs as promised-does a great job filtering out noises and you get used to the sounds quickly"
4,White Noise Maker -- That Makes White Noise as Promised,"I figured I would take the time to write a review because I found the reviews of others very useful. This ugly little machine simply Does what it is designed to do. It makes white noise! Nothing more, nothing less. It has 2 different levels (each of which you can open and close to change the sound a bit). Its not full of features, night lights or no other crap. It simply makes white noise (which helps drown out other noises). I got it..to cut the sound between my room and my roomates room. We're both in our 20's and sometimes I need to get some rest when he is still up chilling. I have only had it for about a month now but I am VERY happy with it. No complaints whatsoever thus far."
5,Great for masking noise while you sleep.,"The SleepMate Sound Conditioner has helped us avoid being awakened by noise. Our neighbor's dog was barking in the middle of the night and woke up several neighbors, we never heard it!It doesn't completely hide some noises, but they become much less noticeable. The white noise is a great help when someone is up after family members have gone to bed. The sounds from the TV, doors, and bathroom do not keep us from falling asleeep. We have also found this useful when staying in downtown Chicago, which is much noisier than our neighborhood.I found the white noise to be almost sedating from the start. My spouse took a night or two to get used to it, but now loves it. We have ordered six more for other family members and friends."
4,Marpac Sleepmate,Received item quickly. It was as advertised and works well to cover street noises at night.
1,Not loud enough for the price!!,"Don't waste your money if you looking to block out most noises like the t.v in the next room, a lawn mower in the mornings, dogs barking...etc. cause I could hear ALL of that! Might be good for travel since it's SO small but I was SHOCKED at the price for how quiet it was! Turned my small fan on in the same room and it was the same exact loudness! Searching for a turbo fan to create that loud ""white noise"" to block out just regular sounds due to the fact that Amazon only has two or three white noise machines to offer...kind of amazed there isn't more of a variety!"
3,its ok,I think that this product is built good. I would have liked it to be a bit more quite. I need to have the machine in my bedroom & it is a bit loud for that. If I put it in another room it does not mask the traffic hum I bought it for.
4,Really Works!,"I purchased the Marpac White Noise machine for my son for Christmas. He had always used a fan to block out outside noise while trying to sleep. I could always hear the fan in my bedroom and it would annoy me. This machine takes care of the outside noises for him and I no longer hear the whirling of the fan from his room. This works well for outside noises like cars, birds in the morning and other annoyances. However, it doesn't block out the television sound from the next room. This is the one thing that he doesn't like about the machine. Otherwise, it does a good job in reducing noise."
1,poor quality,"I am actually surprised by how many positive reviews this product has. I believe that due to the cheap construction quality it produces an intermittent whiny high pitched noise in addition to the constant middle and lower frequency noises it produces to create ""white noise"". In the end, the intermittent high pitches noise of the motor inside will come and go regardless of placing padding underneath or the settings you use. I tried everything I could think of and it didn't work, so I sent it back. It could be that the unit I had was defective, but it sounds like many other people here experienced the same thing...."
5,Can't live without it!,I just bought my second SleepMate. The first one still works fine but I thought that after 16 years of heavy use it was time for a new one.(My wife and I fight over it when I travel). I'm a light sleeper so this machine has changed my life because it provides a soft background noise that helps keep me in my deep sleep. This is probably one of the best products I have ever purchased.
5,Noise Machine,"i think i would cry if something ever happened to this... i was recommended it by my friend who uses it for her baby and raved about it (my friend ;) not her baby!) the first night i got it, i felt it didnt quite help, but i think i just needed to adjust to it... now i even bring it w/ me when i travel. its a must have for city noise. i was kept up by a train EVERY NIGHT and since i got this i sleep much better. i even like to keep it on during the day while i work or do things around the house to block out crazy city noise."
5,REM Sleep at last!,"I ordered this machine and got it less than a week ago and I already love it. I am very prone to insomnia and light sleeping these past years in my life. Since I started using this sleep machine this week, every night I have deep sleep with many dreams that I still remember when I wake up. This tells me that I'm really sleeping soundly. I feel very refreshed, even after only a shorter nights sleep, because it's a deeper,non interrupted sleep I guess. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,didn't solve everything......,"I got the Marpac 980 SleepMate as a way to block out snoring, outside noises (chirping birds, loud people, car horns, loud car engines, and other related things). As far as the outside noise, the SleepMate does a good job of either blocking out the noise or taking my mind off of it b/c it makes you focus on the white noise. As far as snoring is concerned, it doesnt do much. It might help a bit with loud breathing, but it didnt block out the snoring at all. I guess it was wishful thinking, b/c thinking about it now, it would take alot to block out snoring completely. All in all, it creates a pretty comfortable environment to sleep in. Although there are days that I feel the machine is too loud (even on its lowest setting). Turning it up higher doesn't really block out more noise, so I am not sure why the higher setting exists. Some sounds cannot be blocked out by white noise machines."
5,marriage Saver,"If you have a spouse who snores or your bedroom is in an area with other noise, you will love this. After the first night, I was kicking myself for not buying it on my honeymoon 17 years ago!!"
2,Not loud enough,"Use this with earplugs to drown out an annoying dripping noise on my ceiling. Without the earplugs, it wouldn't do me any good - it's simply not loud enough to drown out the dripping. Wish it had more volume settings."
4,Marpac sound machine,"I purchased this unit because we had been using a floor fan to drown out noise while my shift-working husband slept. It does the job, but is not quite as loud as the floor fan. Louder noises can still be heard. At least it doesn't make the room cold in the winter like the fan does. It is easy to operate and takes up little room. I like it."
5,We use this for our baby,"We have been using this since our son was born and he is now 20 months old. WE LOVE IT! It covers all conversation and you can adjust the volume depending on how loud the home is. I think if they made it in blue and pink they could sell thousands of these! My sister uses a sound machine and there are so many buttons to get it to the ""wind"" noise she likes for her kids. This is one button and you're done! I tell every new mom this is a must!"
2,Not as good as they used to be,"This sound conditioner is much, much quieter than they used to be several years ago. I would not recommend it since most home noises come through even when the conditioner is turned all the way up."
2,Too (White-) Noisy!,I bought this white-noise machine sound-unheard (the aural equivalent of sight-unseen?). I've heard many white-noise machines before -- this one is of poorer quality -- it's TOO LOUD at its quietest. I would not recommend it.
2,SleepMate,Makes a lot of noise but does not seem to block other noises per myself. My husband believes in it but I don't. Can not seem to get it to make ocean noises or any other kind except a buzzing noise.
5,Very calming ! Can be as loud or as soft as you like !,"When I visit a counselor, I noticed a faint sound that seemed to have a very calming effect on me. When I asked her what it was, she pointed to this little machine in the corner. They use use it because the walls are thin there, and when having a counseling session, the last thing you want is to hear the one going on in the next room !So I ordered this, and have placed it in a corner in my bedroom. I notice that it has that same calming feeling, when turned on low, and just quiet enough so that that you don't necessarily notice it after a while.With 2 noise settings, and the ability to adjust how many of the holes are open or closed, you can make this as loud, or soft as you like. Also, even when on its loudest setting, it doesn't bother my ""skiddish"" cat, who runs when I breathe loudly ! I think it calms her too !Use it everyday since I got it, and love it !"
2,overpriced and unreliable,"The (somewhat adjustable) sound this thing makes is soothing... until the bearings go bad. Then you get irritating bearing noises. I had mine for less than two years before I had to start wearing earplugs to muffle the bearing noise. Admittedly, the thing has been knocked off my nightstand a couple times.I'd pay twenty five dollars for a replacement, but not the asking price."
2,Doubles as a de-humidifier!!!,"If you don't mind the room being robbed of all humidity, then this machine will work well for you. I like the white noise quality, but I wake up feeling all dried up."
2,Higher exceptations,"High expectations breed disappointment. This was a high ticket item for me and I was looking forward to it. It was way too loud for me, disturbingly so. Still on the search for a better machine."
2,Re Sound Conditioner,"I returned it. I found the volume almost useless for my purposes of wishing a ""White Noise"" - tuning out the sound."
4,Loved It!,"I'm not a big book reader, but once I started with this book, I couldn't put it down! I read this book in 2 days, which is a record for me! It really got good towards the middle part. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next! I found it to be well written, and easy to read. The author describes everything so well, that you almost feel like you are in the scenes. At first, I really liked the main character, Erik. I even felt sorry for him. However, by the end of the book, I absolutely hated him! I would recommed this book to anyone who is interested in a good love/hate story."
3,Just okay,"Yea, I really liked Smoke Signals. A lot. Love Alexie's poetry, too. This movie has its moments, and thank god there are no bad wigs in this one, but it seemed too self conscious and redundant in some of the themes of SA's first film. I did enjoy the poetry, but it seemed an easy way to get poems into a film--write a screenplay about a poet. Still, good acting, well filmed, and good enough to keep me watching until the end."
3,Watch band not covered by warranty,"I loved this watch until the band broke after 6 months. I found the band was not covered by the warranty, and the shape of the band was unique. To replace it with a Seiko band costs over $37.00. So, I either have to get a band that is not tapered, buy a new watch (not a Seiko) or spend the money for the Seiko band."
5,GREAT TV SHOW!!!,This is an awesome tv show! I highly recommend it to anyone (not just sci/fi fans).
4,Worth it,"This series has good special effects. The writing is good. It just good sci-fi with a totally plausable premise, very enjoyable."
4,no proper ending?,"My wife and I loved Earth 2 when it was being aired, but since it was cancelled so quickly, she doesn't want the DVD because she feels they never ""ended"" the series. I can't recall the last episode myself. Did they? I mean like with Babylon 5, there was a very clear ending to the series even though they left a few openings for possible spin-offs."
1,It stinks!,"This was perhaps the most embarrassing piece of crap to be labeled ""sci-fi"" since ""Space Rangers"" or perhaps ""Battlestar Galitica 1980"". This stinker relies on a sickly mixture of the tired old ""evil gov't conspiracy"" and ""scary aliens"" plot devices that just don't work beside the ""Wagon Train in shiney metal"" look and feel.This series fell into the Hollywood sci-fi crap-trap in near record time (the use of a cute kid, smart dog or stupid robot). The writing was completely shot by the end of the first season.If you must waste many hours of your consciousness, you can find many, many more rewarding ways to do it."
2,Earth WHO?,"This was a fair show in so much it tried to be a story of suvival and growing as a race.It started off well, but soon began to make the mistakes of past shows. ""Let the story be about the kids!"" ""Let the kids save the day!"" As STNG, Seaquest, and others found out, that does not make a good story.With all the ""Survival"" TV shows on today, Earth 2 may have done better as a game show.Still good to watch when you have nothing else to do."
4,One of the best sci-fi shows ever,"Earth 2 was one of the best Sci fi shows of all time. Made in the 90s The show was about a small group of colonists who suppose to be setting up a home on a new planet, but crash and are forced to learn how to survive, without most of their supplies while travelling to their new home. A good range of local species, to help out and try to understand.Only downside to this product is they arranged the episodes in air date order, not timeline, so the last 3 episodes are out of sequence."
4,mainstream movie with unsimulated sex,"this is a dark movie with a lot of sub plots. surprisingly it's an ok movie. if you're looking for something a little outside of the mainstream norm, then this is that movie, a good buy and not overly priced as so many adult themed movies tend to be."
4,Nice and compact,"This unit is easier to store in my travel bag than the charger that came with the phone, but it has a few minor oddities. When it is done charging the phone, the LED light on the charger starts dimming/pulsing. This doesn't look like normal operation for an LED. Also, this charger seems to generate a lot of interference for TV's and radios that I don't get with the Siemens charger. Even with those issues, it has worked reliably for me."
2,not great to sit on,Not as close to using a fitness ball as i had hoped. I bought this cause my chiropracter said it's like sitting on a ball while i'm at work so it will help with my core. the thing is really uncomfortable to sit on and doesnt help. I ended up buying an exercise ball to sit on at work.
1,Good quality on one side. Very poor on the other side and seams of the two.,"One side is indeed micro fiber, which is soft and comfortable.However, the other side is cheap, static prone, material that is very uncomfortable to sleep with. Since you do not touch the micro fiber side while you sleep, it does not matter how the micro fiber feels. The material looks good, though, to tell you the bright side.The seams of the two sides are very poor and look very cheap.If you want to feel the micro fiber and sleep with the micro fiber side in, then what you have there is you in a very cheap looking duvet.I am not happy with their description claiming it is made of 100% micro fiber.This is only 50% micro fiber.I return the product on the day it was arrived. I seriously do not understand why the other reviewer thinks this is a good quality. The worst duvet among 30 that I have slept in entire my life."
3,Poor craftmanship,I purchased this item for the price... when it arrived all the button holes were sewen up... so I had to cut them myself. I would of just returned the item but it wasn't worth the cost of shipping it back. I think the top of it is nice but the underside is a satin type material disapointed as I thought the entire cover was the microsuede... disapointed with this one big time.
4,Great set for the price.,We purchased this set for 20 bucks and it was a steal of a deal. I'd recommend it to anyone.
4,Necessary for students of Tibetan,"This book is invaluable and necessary for students of modern Tibetan. For those like 'iasa' in Aspen, it is useless simply because what they need is an English-Tibetan dictionary! Anyone obtuse enough not to know the difference shouldn't be surprised to find that they can't read Tibetan unless they know the script and the basics of spelling."
5,Its hard to wait for God,"Being a Tricky fan of the underground I will always love anything he puts out. Yet when I heard the first rifts of the track ""Don't Wanna Stay"" I knew there was nothing but pure amazement in store. Knowing that the familiar voice from his past work was gone and this beautiful angel was in place. I was wondering what was in store. The new voice on the CD is just soothing and a perfect counter to Tricky. The two of them fit so well with astonishing beats and heavy lyrics that make you think and place these songs into the sound track of your life. The best songs are the title song Vulnerable, Don't Wanna' Stay, Wait for God, and Car Crash.I don't think this album will be topped. Its with little question one of his best. If you liked much of the massive attack protection albums you'll love Vulnerable."
1,Forced Melodrama.,"There are times when movie directors take a good plot line and try to make it overly dramatic by slowing down the pace between events to the extreme and by highlighting things that are best left emphasized naturally. This film is a prime example of such a case. The story itself of Evelyn Nesbit is a compelling one, but this film bores one to tears. The only reason we finished it is to see how it all worked out in the end. The young Joan Collins is charming. And the aging Ray Milland is a sympathetic character, which actually works to the detriment of the film. As one could be more involved with the story line if the character of Frank White were not so likeable in the form of Ray Milland. If one isn't familiar with the story of Evelyn Nesbit, who was the inspiration for the face of Anne in Anne of Green Gables as per Lucy Maud Montgomery's diary, this movie serves as a good introduction. But as far as the movie itself is concerned, it isn't worth neither the time nor the money."
5,The Lion King,"This is a great soundtrack, it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do"
5,Lion King CD,"After seeing the movie, my grandson wanted to sing the songs. He now can sing along and knows the words to his favorites."
5,THE best Disney soundtrack EVER,It is the best work (and probably the only good work) Elton John ever did.
3,"Good CD quality, but music only ok","The CD quality was very good. However, the music was not nearly as great as the broadway music version. I hoped to exchange the CD after purchase, but it was not an option."
2,Get out of the pool.,"This movie is hard to stomach. The best part of the movie comes from the sporadic insertion of skating sequences. The skaters are skilled and a pleasure to watch, but this does not make a good movie. The humor in the movie is sophomoric at best and never really produces a good laugh. I felt that my time was wasted by sitting in front of this drivel for 104 minutes. Avoid this loser of a movie."
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,This movie was absoulty horrible. Its plot was bad and its jokes were not funny. In addition it was sexist and degrading to women. This is the worst movie in history. Never see it. EVER.
1,"Worst skateboarding movie ever, one of the worst movies of any genre","When even appearances by some of the hottest skaters out there and excellent skating footage can't redeem a movie, you know it's something awful. The thin plot is a pointless retread of the tired ""underdog makes good"" format; its protagonists are shallow cliches portrayed by actors who know they have a bad job and therefore don't feel compelled to put in much effort. The toilet humor and the sexism might be terribly offensive if one could work up the energy to care."
5,Very unique nightlight,"This is the third nightlight I have purchased from this manufacturer. I love the fact that it is kind of dimmed, not so bright, enough to see where you are going without bright glare. So far I have purchased two Beach scenes and also one with the light tower. The porcelain is very delicate and pretty."
1,Don't bother,"Just bought one on eBay for the low price - you really do get what you pay for.First it would not stay plugged in - I had to hold the plug to the reader to get it to stay. Once I got it to, it would not even work with my CF card - it works with an SD card, but plugging in the CF card makes the whole thing completely undetectable on my computer."
1,Won't install on a Mac,"As it presently stands, this product will not install on a Mac, and the company is saying that an installable disc won't be available until ""late January or February."" How, one might reasonably ask, can a company ship a product that won't install? And why do they not make this blunder public (on their web site, for instance) and pull the product from the shelves?"
4,"Good, but not great...","1/4 The Cure + 1/4 Superchunk + 1/4 At The Drive In + 1/4 The Smiths = Brand NewFor the most part, this CD is very above average. There are only a couple of reasons that I didn't give it a 5 star rating. The first reason is that there are two parts on the CD where the flow comes to almost a complete halt. One of which is the last song, which sounds way too much like a second rate Counting Crows song..which leads me to my second complaint..At times, Brand New ends up sounding too much like second rate versions of other bands. The first single in fact, ends up coming off a bit too much like a second rate At The Drive In song..that is if ATDI wrote songs for the specific purpose of getting on MTV 2. If the CD could have trimmed a bit of the excess off, and the songs didn't sometimes come off sounding a bit too unoriginal, then I could have given it a 5 star rating. However, I think that when a band writes songs like that, it makes me wonder what they truely got into music for."
3,Very Different,"This cd is very different from the first. It's like they went from taking back sunday sound to somthing corporate type music, but it is still very good. I recommend to buy the first cd first, and then buy the second."
5,great sophmore album,"Brand New's first album, Your Favorite Weapon, was an awsome debut release. This album is also very very good, but also very different from Your Favorite Weapon. The lyrics are amazing. Brand New's songs aren't just mindless words thrown together like some punk bands. The lyrics are meaningful and thought provoking. Songs like ""Okay I beleive you but my tommy gun don't"" and ""Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis"" have fascinating lyrics. The music in general isn't as fast paced as their first album. A lot of the songs move along to a slower pace but break into a frantic chorus. They make it work though. This album isn't quite as poppy as the first one and in my opinion is almost as good. I recommend this album to anyone who like their first album."
2,Not what your going to expect.,"If you expect this CD to sound ANYTHING like the single, then your going to be dissapointed. There single is one sick song, and these guys defenitely have talent, but the rest the CD is so different from that song. If you really like weird almost ""weezerlike"" emo, then you'll like this CD, but if your looking for anything like the single it's probably not worth it to you."
2,Why do people like this?,"Brand New frist caught me on the radio with their first single ""Quiet Things that No One ever knows"" I thought it was a fairly good song. Then I saw them at the Almost Acoustic Christmas 2003, and I thought they were really good. So,I bought this album and I nearly fell asleep. At the most there is three good songs. The rest are all boring. The lyrics feel uninspired and the vocals just are flat-out boring. Most of the songs sound the same. Everyone seems to praise this band. I am a hardcore Thrice, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and AFI kind of guy. And these guys don't even come close to the same talent they have. Stay Away!"
4,"Good, but very different.","I was surprised, albeit pleasantly, when I put this album on. It is Radically different than ""Your Favorite Weapon"". It is less pop-punk and more emo. Which is not a bad thing, per se. I suggest that one sample some of the songs before buying this CD, even if you were a fan of their previous CDs. I think that this CD is still a great buy, and defineately reccommed it."
4,Time To Mature With Brand New,"I have been a dedicated Brand New fan since I bought their first CD, ""Your Favorite Weapon"". That CD was probably one of the best CD's I have bought in a very long time. I found myself listening to all the tracks on the Album, and quickly learning all the words as I sang along to the CD in my car. The day Deja Entendu came out, I rushed over to all the music stores in my city to get the CD. After three unsuccessful trips to various stores, I went to the local mall and finally bought the CD. I listened to it hoping for same affect I got from ""Your Favorite Weapon"", but it didn't come to me. Instead of the catchy, poppy, punk melodies which their first CD consisted of, Deja Entendu came at me with more spirit and heart, more emotion. I recommend this CD to anyone. It may be different, but change is not always a bad thing, You may still find yourself singing along to Jesse, Vinnie, Brian, and Garrett. I know that I still do."
5,*jaw drops open*,"This album kicks all a**. Brand New's lyrics have totaly evolved from My Favorite weapon, and so has their sound. This album was so much deeper and more personal than their first, it's awsome."
1,ouch,"i heard this was a good cd but i heard wrong. everyone said that they were awesome when they toured with taking back sunday and i absolutely LOVE taking back sunday so i bought brand new's cd. big mistake. i thought it was horrible, i liked about two songs on the whole cd. advice-download about 5 random songs from the cd before you buy it to see if you like it. it was the biggest waste of 12 dollars in my whole life."
1,Horrible,"If you liked the first Brand New album, then you will most likely hate this album. It doesn't sound anything like the first album at all. It sounds like a different band. It's no longer punk music. It's this slow music, lots of acoustic. And the guy's voice doesn't even sound the same. And he talks so softly it sounds like his mouth is practically touching the mic. There are a few punk sounding parts in a couple of the songs. But that does not justify the other 40 minutes. I feel ripped off because you buy a band's album because you like their sound. This doesn't even come close to their original sound. Imagine Metallica's Load compared to their older stuff only ten times worse. I wish I didn't buy this album and I want my money back."
3,Kiddie Pool,Occasionally I need a very large bowl for barbecue or extra extra large salad so I purchased this kiddie pool-sized bowl. It is as large as it says in the description.I gave it 3/5 (AVERAGE) because it's a little thin. I don't expect it to last forever but it's _very_ thin.
3,My dog likes it...,"but I will never order a 16 pound bag of dog food with those shipping costs tagged on again. I somehow thought I was going to save something. Aside from having to wait 10 days for something I could have gone to PetSmart down the street for...oh, well you live and learn."
2,boredom and controversy,"If you missed following the 2002 Formula One season, you didn't miss very much, and it is definitely not worth revisiting one of the most appaling seasons of the sport with a review video. If you must or if you are a die-hard fan, this video makes the best of reporting on a season that is better quickly forgotten. It remains noteworthy that this is the year in which Schumacher equalled Fangio's five world championships, but it is also a year of processional racing, no wheel-to-wheel battles and on top of that Ferrari executing team orders and extremely poor judgement in two cases, in Austria and the US. This season did nothing for the popularity of the sport, on the contrary. The video quality of this tape is solid as usual, the commentary neutral to boring, and all in all it is a pretty sad affair"
3,"Good, but not great","I have become a big fan of Craig Thompson, but I think I read his books in the wrong order. I started with hisCarnet De Voyage (Travel Journal), which is his most recent work. That got me interested in the book for which he was on tour,Blankets. As a newbie to graphic novels, I was completely blown away by Blankets which is more of a memoir than novel. So I felt compelled to get Good-bye, Chunky Rice, Mr. Thompson's first book. The characters, the writing, and the visual style are good, but not nearly as interesting to me as the other two books."
5,Great Program,"As a teacher this is a wonderful program for students to learn Spanish. I actually liked it, because I learned some basic words to help me communicate with my Spanish speaking students."
5,It's fun and kids love it,"I rec'd Dino Lingo dvd from the company themself for free, thanks to influenter! My kids were so excited for me to play the dvd. The cartoon character helped them relate and they were so eager to learn.I would recommend this dvd to parents who wants to teach their kids another language. It's's fun and entertaining my kids loves it."
4,great for kids,"at first i was skeptical about this product, but after a while my 3 year old really enjoyed using it and learned a lot, i would reccomend this to anyone wanting their child to learn a second language"
4,makes learning fun,This dvd makes learning a second language like spanish fun for kids. My little ones love watching it and learning.
5,Dino Lingo Spanish for Kids is Wonderful,The Dino Lingo Spanish for Kids was just perfect for my 4 year old daughter! She really loved the variety of things she was learning. I love that it has cute animations and an entertaining way for children to learn a different language.
5,Great for older kids who have problems with lanuguages,"I didn't received the Dino Lino DVD from Influencer to try, but I was able for free to do a 22 min trial of a lesson and my daughter did Spanish. Foreign Language doesn't come easy to my daughter so I would definitely consider buying this program in French for her to use as a aid with her regular classwork lessons."
4,Perfect for kids to learn,My 5 year old used this program to increase his Spanish proficiency. This is such a great tool for kids to pick up another language at an early age.
5,Positive Belt Buckle Review,The Belt Buckle I purchased was exactly as shown. I was very pleased with the product. The buckle was a big hit for our grandsons as part of their birthday presents! Thank you for the quality of the product.
2,dont get this PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, dont get me wrong this phone is okay since it has a music player but at the end of the day this phone sucks!!!!!!!!!! The only reason why I got it was becuase it was cheap for me to renew my contract with T-mobile. It was not worth it. You cant listen to the radio unless you have the EXACT headphones that T-moblie gives to you, otherwise you have to plug in a stupid audio converter device. The camera takes pics that look like they were developed in 1974. And the stupid thing locks its buttons every 5 minutes. I have to unlock or open the phone every time want to look at something."
5,songs even parents will like,"Lots of singing and dancing, which is what our son likes. Catchy songs you won't mind hearing again and again. Sound quality is excellent (for playing in the car DVD) and good value, since you also get the bonus video. We highly recommend...."
5,"Timely story of how easy the ""media"" is manipulated","If you ever wondered how to get your side of the story to be played in the media, this is a good guide. First, you must understand that the media is lazy, loves dirty laundry and rewards being first over being right. Second, hire a ""PR"" firm even if its a firm of one. Third, have the ""PR"" firm leak the story on a selective basis to individual memebers of the media. If they run the story the way you want, continue leaking to them. Punish the media who do not sensationalize the story by not giving them anymore leaks. Turns out the media can be very useful to your side. This media manipulation works in a wide variety of cases (see Scooter Libby).Interesting side note, I did not previously know of link between CU football and NYFD. Turns out they have done good things for each other."
4,Celtic Woman: Believe,"I find I'm not watching ""Believe"" as much as earlier products of Celtic Woman. Perhaps it's because, though beautifully done, it is too ""controlled,"" too much the same and not quite as enchanting. It lacks the ""spontaneity"" and excitement of earlier productions. -Anne Moore"
4,"A great concert, well-recorded.","It's impossible not to enjoy the music of Celtic Woman. However, since they are obviously such a made-for-PBS franchise at this point, the real issue for someone wondering whether or not to purchase the DVD is: What will I get for my money that goes beyond the concert I can get for free on my DVR? I'm such a fan that I have bought them all, but I am still waiting for the ""extra"" material that will really make it worth the investment."
2,Shocking,"Shockingly little skin for a mid-80s WIP. Aside from one hanging, shockingly little violence. Lots of dark (i.e. what am I looking at?) scenes show they couldn't pay for a electrician on the set."
4,Good songs with great musicians,Good album with great production.The elements that really Jump out on this record are the well-written songs in it. Part of this may be accredited to Boyd's collaborations with Doyle Brammhall II which really pay off. Bramhall actually wrote the first single and his guitar playing can be heard through out the entire album.Great pick
1,Where's the music,"The Cd ""True Reflections"" has a great title cut. However, I enjoyed this Cd about as much as I would a CD featuring Dave on the violin, Carter on trumpet or Stephan on vibes. I sing unbelievably well in the shower as I'm sure Boyde does, but I wouldn't attempt to disseminate my shower talent to the masses. Anyone who has ever seen Boyde jam on stage knows that he brings something special to the world of violin virtuosity. Boyde is a great showman and plays boss violin, but sadly not on this CD. Please Boyde, jazz violin, blues violin, bebop violin, or bluegrass fiddle. Whatever violin, I don't care, I'd buy it in a minute. Be happy with the God given talent you've nurtured, because at least you have one. I don't. And please share more of it with your fans. Great CD cover though."
2,Yuck...,"Not at all what I expected...wimpy vocals, very little of what Tinsley does best (play the damned violin, Boyd!)...I didn't prescreen any of the songs so really didn't know what to expect...I gambled and lost. Bummer."
1,Where do I get my two hours back?,"This movie was gawd awful in the theater (film festival) and we left before the director started talking because I would have demanded my two hours back.The charachters are annoying, the plot is dull and long before the end of the movie, I was ready to leave. Kept hoping it would get better - it didn't!Unless you have two hours to completely waste, don't go anywhere near this movie. Actually, I'm sure that you can find something else to do."
3,Disappointed and frustrated,"I have used waterless cookware all my adult life. I had Magnalite pots and pans for 50 years and decided that, for our 50th Anniversary, I would get some new ones. Magnalite is no longer available so I decided to try these. I have had a stainless pan before so I felt comfortable ordering these.The first thing I cooked was frozen peas. I followed directions and the peas cooked perfectly but...the stainless pans stained! I tried another recipe...the pot roast...and made large stains that wouldn't go away with washing. Everything I cook leaves stains on the bottom of the pans. If I want nice pans again, I'll probably have to get stainless steel cleaner. I have followed their directions for washing and rinsing carefully so I don't know why they stain..... PLUS, the middle saucepan lid doesn't seal properly. BUMMER!"
4,great hawaiian music!,"It's surprising to me just how good this album is. I got it late last year and repeated listenings sound better each time! I was more familiar with his brothers, Cyril and Bla. Martin is the youngest son of Hawaiian slack key legend Gabby Pahinui.Recorded on July of 2002, Martin handles the lead vocals on this, and plays rhythm guitar, leaving the lead slack key to the very capable George Kuo (both 6 and 12 string), who also sings background vocals. Aaron Mahi plays bass and handles background vocals. Steel guitar player Bobby Ingano appears on 7 of the 13 songs.The vocals are all excellent. Hawaiian is a language that just flows and is so easy to listen to. At times Martin uses the high falsetto that reminds me of his father. The words are mostly in Hawaiian, a few lines of English thrown in here and there.Like i said before, this album was a wonderful surprise to me. It puts me in a true Hawaiian spirit, and the mood remains from beginning to end."
1,Condition Issues,"Listed as a new book. When it arrived, the dust cover was dirty, scratched and torn. The paper quality of the book's pages was poor. The pages on the top of the book edge are colored yellow where the rest of the pages are ivory toned. Very disappointed in the product. Was embarrassed to present it as a gift. Would not buy from this seller again."
1,Worthless Pseudo-History,"This is by far the worst Jefferson biography on the market. It is a piece of what is called ""psycho-history"" in which the author makes a wide range of unbacked assertions which are rooted in absurd and often comical renderings of both Jefferson's words and actions. The main body Brodie's conjecture is refuted in Virgunius Dabney's excellent work ""The Jefferson Scandals: A Rebuttal."" If you are looking for a real biography of the man, seek out the works of Dumas Malone, Merill Peterson, or Noble Cunningham."
5,Roach Prufe,I purchased this for my grand mother and she says that the product worked wonders and that after she put it down she hasn't seen any roaches! Great!
1,NOT WORKING!,When I bought this I put it almost everywhere in the kitchen I gave it 24 hours then I saw BIGGER roaches!! I gave an other 24 hours then I saw more! didn't kill any of them so basically this product feeds the roaches and makes them bigger trust me! they just make you pay money for nothing I wouldn't recommend this powder for any one!
3,disappointing for a Wusthof knife,"I have an entire block of Wusthof knives, and out of the box, this was by far the dullest. The first thing I had to do was sharpen it. I am inexperienced in the use of vegetable cleavers, and find the balance uncomfortable, but perhaps it will improve as I get used to it."
2,From the rubbles of Nazi-Germany,"This is an unfinished novel from Heinrich Böll, as usual he is writing about social differences, religion and love. The thing I liked most about the novel is that it takes place in a totally destructed German city in May 1945. There is something very interesting when a war ends and, an otherwise civilized country and people, return to civilization. (In undeveloped countries this is not so interesting because the culture that exisited before and after the war is so barbaric anyway. (like Somalia or Iraq)). But the scene in Germany and Japan just after WW2 was kind of interesting because it was highly developed countries, especially nazi Germany. Anyway the book is unfinished so the plot is a little confusing."
4,"Timely, twisted and totally Larsonesque humor.","While ""There's a Hair in My Dirt!: A Worm's Story"" may not have the instant ""punch"" of a typical single-panel ""Far Side"" cartoon, there's plenty to recommend it. The drawings are fun and colorful (love the Dame Edna eyeglasses on Mother Worm). Despite a vague sense of repetitousness, the twisted, often-hilarious story should appeal to youngsters, teens and anyone interested in creepy crawlies. With the current success of DreamWorks' ""Antz"" in movie theaters and the positive advance buzz (pun intended) for Disney's upcoming ""A Bug's Life,"" it surely is a worm's turn. Besides -- dare I say it? -- it's also EDUCATIONAL (in a delightfully subversive, Larsonesque way)."
5,Perfect comination of humor and seriousness,"This is really the only halfway ""serious"" work I've seen from Gary Lason. And I really like it! Although it has a definite (and very good) moral, it's not 'preachy'. Depending on the mood you're in, this can be a funny book, a serious book, or a little bit of each. Great satire, great point."
5,TWISTED,IF YOU ARE A LITTLE TWISTED THIS IS A VERY FUNNY BOOK. THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS ARE A WHINER AND A DO GOODER.
4,trick you kids into learning,"Gary Larson expands beyond the single-panel comics of the ""Far Side"" to a full children's book. But, as you would expect, this book is not really just for kids. Anyone fan of the ""Far Side"" is sure to get a kick out of this book too. The story starts with father, mother and son earthworm sitting (?) down for a dinner of dirt, when the son complains about life as a worm. Father tells him the rambling story of Harriet, who loves nature even though she misunderstands just about all of it. This somehow leads to the dreaded moral of the story and the truth behind the hair in the dirt. This is a fun, yet educational, book for anyone old enough to have developed a twisted sense of humor."
5,One of the Best Books Ever Written,"A cautionary tale to the wanta-be eco/green enthusiast. If you want to help, be informed and act wisely not from prejudice and misconception. This book humorously delivers this very important message."
2,not for young children,"I bought this book for my sons and was disappointed in the language. I was hoping for an explanation of what worms are good for in an amusing way.It is far too advanced for my six year old son and some of the comments are unsuitable (like ""Oh, Mother Nature! What a sex maniac you are!)I didn't see an age suggestion on the product description, so I went by the picture and the other reviewers. I wish somebody had mentioned the type of language that the author thinks is funny.I consider it an adult book in bad taste."
5,Get your history first-hand. A terrific book.,"Reading this book was a treat. Reading first-hand accounts of incidents will give you a picture of how things really were. Notice the chapter on ""A Mob Confronts A Stamp Collector"". This made me feel like I was seeing exactly what happened. The book can be read from any chapter all of which are independent of one another. One caveat. Make sure you have a weekend to spare because once you get into the text it's goodbye everything else. Excellent history."
5,"Eyewitness is a rich, vivid slideshow of Amer. history","It's not often that a history book can genuinelydraw its readers into the critical moment.""Eyewitness to America"" masterfully achieves thisformidable task by presenting memorable firstperson accounts of events as they were occuring.This vivid selection of chronicles successfullyrelates the perspective, immediacy and evenpassion which is inherent in every moment worthremembering but which is so often lacking in manyhistory books. The accounts of minor historicalevents are as interesting and surprising as thosefor major events, which is most likely the resultof thoughtful editing by David Colbert. Thisbook is like a great slideshow of the last500 years where no frame is redundant, boring orblurred. Whether your interest is casual,burning or somewhere in between, you will findthis collection to be extremely worthwhile andenjoyable reading. ""Eyewitness to America""should be a valued addition to any bookshelf.It is on mine."
5,Awesome CD for the whole family!,"We LOVE this cd! My husband and I put it on each day for our 20-month-old. I love that it's actual jazz musicians with an authentic sound- not remakes of songs by one group. My 20-month-old loves ""What a Wonderful World"" and often requests to listen to it 3 times in a row. ""World Song, Mommy!"" But I've also heard her try to sing ""The Muffin Man."" I really can't pick my favorite song since they are all so catchy and really fun to sing along with. I would definitely recommend this CD to any family. I think kids (and adults) of all ages would get a kick out of listening to it!"
5,Wonderful!,I am a music teacher and my students are thrilled with this CD. My children bought this CD for me for Christmas and I absolutely love it! I highly recommend Jazz for Kids!
5,A whole lotta Louis's... and a whoile lotta fun!,"What's not to like? Ella, Louis Prima, Louis Jordan, Louis Armstrong... this cd has it all! Kids will be singing along in no time!!"
4,Great Music for KIDS,My grandson loved this CD; this is the second of this type we have purchased for him and expect to buy more!
4,Love Jazz,"I was raised on jazz... the era of Ella, Count Basie, Oscar Peterson, Joe Williams, etc... This CD is wonderful and I would have given it 5 stars except for one phrase. In the fantastic rendition of ""Old MacDonald"" that Ella sings, she says ""Ah, to heck with it."" My pre-schoolers on up the elementary ages listen to this music and love it. Using the phrase, ""to heck with it"" I don't think is appropriate for them to repeat. I really wish that I didn't feel I need to make future buyers aware of something like this that is for kids, but there might be some parents out there with values that wouldn't appreciate that language for children. We've really enjoyed the Lisa Yves series of jazz for kids."
5,Worth Every Penny,"Blu Cantrell's new cd is everything I can ask for. Her vocals are great, while the songs are well-produced. She actually talks about stories you can relate to.She's a diva in the making, and she deserves more attention and time on TV. The single ""Breathe"" is probably one of the best songs I've heard lately.""Sleep In The Middle"", ""Risk It All"", ""Let Her Go"", ""Unhappy"" and ""Impatient"" (feat. Lil'Kim and Fat Joe) are my favorites songs in this album.If you like real talent, get this album ASAP."
4,SLEPT ON ALBUM,This album was actually better than said to be....Not actually a standout album but close enough....Blu Cantrell ahs the voice and the power to make it big if people were to recognize her and give her more attention...Even though she tried to diss Beyonce to produce album sales..throwing dirt on her name...After all that..Blue Cantrell does have the power to compete with like of Beyonce..better than Ashanti....with monica and Brandy...Th blusy jazy voice is exceptional and i congradulate he ron this album..BETTER THAN THE FIRSTSTANDOUT JOINTS::*SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE (best song on the album)*RISK IT ALL*I LOVE YOU*MAKE ME WANNA SCREAM*BREATHE*HAPPILY EVER AFTERCOOL JOINTS...BUT NOT THE BEST*Unhappy*IMPATIENT (Feat. Lil Kim and Fat Joe)GO BUY THE ALBUM ITS COOL..MAKE YOU NOD YA HEAD AND YOU FEEL HER
4,Nu Blu is Bittersweet,"In 2001, her first song, ""Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!),"" has made her a household. Now it's 2003, and Blu's back and better than ever on her new LP. When I first bought it, I knew that she will not go to that one-hit wonder thing anytime soon. Some of the songs are bitter, but sometimes sweet. If only she has one more song with Missy Elliott (""Spank Me""), but she decides that 12 songs is enough.These are the songs that I rate:1. ""I Love You"" - 8 (out of 10)2. ""Sleep in the Middle"" - 93. ""Unhappy"" - 94. ""Impatient"" - 8.55. ""Breathe(Remix)"" - 96. ""Risk It All"" - 107. ""Don't Wanna Say Goodbye"" - 5.58. ""Happily Ever After"" - 9.59. ""Holding On To Love"" - 9.510. ""Let Her Go"" - 711. Make Me Wanna Scream"" - 912. ""No Place Like Home"" 10Overall, this is a more mature album for anyone. If Blu has some more hot producers (Missy, Timbaland, The Neptunes, etc.), then this will be a piece of cake."
3,FROM WHAT I HEAR.............,"I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE CD, BUT I HEARD IT WAS GOOD SCENCE HIT E'M UP STYLE FROM THE ALBUM SO BLU. SO YOU CAN GET IT. IF ITS GOOD CONTACT ME AT BOW_WOW_TK@HOTMAIL.COM."
5,my favorite bipod,This bipod is great for quick and immediate shots and it works really well with a chair! I went out shooting potguts and had a blast and it made it even better with the fact i was using this bipod! Great item highly recommended!
1,Where's quality controls on the transfer of this classic to Dvd?,What happened to the video transfer? Hard To watch! My Original VHS is better quality. It's like watching a concert on a roller coster. Boo! Where's the respect to this great preformance. The person responsible for this transfer/quality controls should be fired. Will Keep my VHS & Dump the Dvd!
1,"great performance, awful DVD quality","Having read the reviews of this DVD about how bad its quality is, I went to one of the biggest music stores in the city to see if they would let me watch it in store before deciding to buy it. They did let me watch it and, yes, the picture quality is AWFUL, its grainy and shaky. You can't watch this without getting motion sickness, and the sound was muffled. It's probably the bad conversion from PAL to NTSC that ruined this otherwise spectacular video. I actually own a PAL VHS of this concert and it looks/sounds okay. So, unless you are absolutely dying to see this performance no matter what, do not buy this DVD..."
3,Big question mark over DVD transfer,"This concert is an amazing concert. No question of that. Very strange about the DVD transfer. It a bit like the old projector footage that jumps slightly here and there. I recorded this concert from UK TV (ch 4) in 1987 and the jumping wasnt there in that broadcast. The clarity of the actual image is ok though (on the DVD). The sound is hissy and there is a background noise, it almost sounds like the tape machine motor hum. Its not noticable watching it on the TV, only when I heard it through headphones.Some people say that it isnt watchable. I dont agree, it is still very watchable, and you stlll can see its an amazing concert."
3,What could have been....,"This book *IS* definitely geered towards the beginner, and only assumes a basic knowledge of trigonometry. Indeed, the first few chapters seems to fulfill this well with its easy-flowing text and background info on graphics. Unfortunately, the later chapters look (Starting from the chapter on Quaternions/Euler angles and going until the end of the book) like they were quite rushed which was disappointing considering the nice flow of the previous chapters.Also, if you're looking for code snippets, DON'T LOOK HERE! No CD and the website looks thrown together AND INCOMPLETE (without any source-code!) like the later chapters of this book. See for yourself and you decide... I certainly hope Mr. Dunn doesn't release software the way he releases books!All in all, I gave it 3 stars because it still contains a lot of useful info for a beginner and is a nice review for someone who hasn't seen this stuff in a while."
1,Doesn't feel clean,"Hair was still oily and smelly after using this shampoo. I alternated using this and another shampoo until it was gone. I then switched to a baby shampoo which is still mild, but seems to actually clean my hair and scalp."
4,Very helpful,"I bought one of these for my two dogs, and I liked it well enough to buy another.I walk anywhere from four to six dogs at a time, and this makes walking multiple dogs MUCH easier....no tangled leashes, no losing a dog without realizing it.I connect the two I have with a leash, so the four dogs I have now are all connected."
4,good but a bit misleading...,"First of all, i have been looking for a double dog leash for my two toy size dogs for a long time. The only one I found at PetsMart and PetCo is for ""M-XL"" size dogs. So i gave up and since some reviews say this one is good for small size dogs, I put my order here.The moment i received this product... it is really joke cuz it is exactly the same one I have seen at PetsMart and Petco, where it says M-XL. When I opened it it is actually the universal clip that applies to any harness and leash. So that's the one I could have got from local pet store yet I waited two weeks looking and had to pay for shipping. That is what confuses me and I hope the manufacturer could at least revise the description to save the confusion."
2,"Does not work for large, pulling dogs","I have two black Labs, 90 & 110 lbs. One pulls much more than the other. The issue is the length adjustment in the ""Y"". In theory, you can give the dogs more or less room apart by making the ""Y"" longer or shorter. In practice, the tension clips give way, and the dog that pulls ends up forcing the junction of the three cords at its maximum length, with the meeting point all the way to the end of the lead connection. For me, this puts the dogs too far apart, and I'm constantly getting one wrapped around a light post or tree."
2,Beat up little brown,The book arrived on time and that is the only reason that it is getting 2 stars. To be fair it was listed in fair condition so I will not be too harsh. The book itself has ripped pages and is bent and appears to be water damaged. I am not happy but cannot return the book because I need it for class. I'm sure this was a mistake but I would make sure that I checked a higher condition such as good or excellent before buying again.
4,Fodder for the addicted,"There really isn't much one can say about this product. It has the Clash's videos, and if you are into the Clash, you can get all of their videos plus some extra ""stuff."" The Clash are what they are, which is a damn fine rock and roll outfit. The videos are okay, even very good in one or two instances, but nothing about this disc is remarkable. It's just fodder for those of us who want or need it."
1,Modern Warfare - Global Technologies,"This documentary performs well at a basic level--it conveys the general facts of the diifernt wars. However, it lacks serious military or historical analysis, and I only recommend it to someone seeking a general overview of these wars events."
1,Disappointing!,"Varshney had the opportunity to examine the Hindu-Muslim divide in India using fresh glasses, and he has failed at it. His book is a litany of hackneyed generalizations and simplistic arguments."
2,Not the best of the author's work,"Once Ms. August's name is on the front cover of a book i usually just pick them up but in this particular case that was a drastic mistake. The book was boring and totally unreal. Why would a woman love somebody who she thinks doesn't give a toe nail about her? And why is it that the heroine feels like an old maid even though she less than 40? Is there some cardinal rule about getting married by 25 i don't know about? Well, in any event my advice for this book is to borrow and return...It's not a keeper. Better luck next time, Ms. August, for both me and you."
3,Disappointed,"This was my first encounter with Mr. Gates' fiction. I was impressed by his ability to simulate the main character's deteriorating thoughts, and maintain a difficult style consistently but never felt that the stream of consciousness produced a sense of who the character was or why he deteriorated. Ultimately, he just proved to be a loser with no redeeming qualities whatsoever and I didn't care about him, nor, frankly, was any other character interesting. As a result, while the plot had some promise during his prolonged absence from it, the end of the book had no force. My reaction was, ""that's it? this is what I read 200 pages for?"" I was reminded of the movie, Leaving Las Vegas, about which I had similar feelings."
1,"a detestable, odious read",This book was a total waste of reading time. The main characters are obnoxious in the extreme and I found this book a frustrating read. There is absolutely not one character in the novel you care about. Not only were the characters underdeveloped but the book was tedious in the extreme. I finished the book hoping someone would kill Willis so the book would have at least a happy ending. Save your money and reading time. Do not waste either on this book.
3,A middle class burn-out who throws it all away.,"I had the pleasure of meeting David Gates at the 1991 JFK assassination conference in Dallas (the first ever held there). David was on assignment for NEWSWEEK for a feature story related to the impending release of ""JFK"", but as PRESTON FALLS suggests, David has an assassination novel dying to come out, even though LIBRA covered the subject quite well. I enjoyed his second novel, although not as much as JERNIGAN. The dialogue is particularly effective, but the main character, Willis, is such a self-centered adult-child, that I really didn't care what happened to him. The ending was a little too uncertain, but hopefully the kids weren't too damaged. The character, Jean, was certainly a strong character, and well developed. A book about her would probably be much more interesting."
4,The Quintissential Guide to Guys,"I didn't want to read this book. I really didn't. I passed it by dozens of times in the bookstore, reaching for something else instead, a confection when I had the taste for meat. Male angst-again. Updike, Heller, Russo, I've been there, done that. So not again. Not now.I finally picked it up one day after an hour-long search found me still novel-less. Oh, well. Whatever. Three days later, I put it down.""Preston Falls"" is so gripping, so real, so harrowing, you'll let the phone ring off the hook until you're finished. You want to tell Willis to shape up, do the right thing; but if you're a guy, you know that it wouldn't do any good. I'd write more but I just picked up ""Jernigan"" and feel the need to get started.Oh, one more thing: why only four stars you ask? Hey, if I gave the man five, he'd only let me down next time."
4,Brilliant,"I really liked this book.Christopher Pascale uses much description.I almost felt like I was a part of the story. I was reminded of how we are all human. We all take for granted and make mistakes,at some point in our lives. We all materialize and use stereotypes. Manson reminded me to live in the moment and appreciate those around me."
5,Truth in Advertising,"This product started working within 10-14 days on my white Chihuahua. I hated the tear stains on my adorable puppy's face, so I decided to try this product. I was doubtful, but it completely did away with the pink streaks. The best part is that ""Moose"" loves the taste when I mix it with a little wet puppy food. I'm very happy with this product. If it hasn't worked for you after a couple of weeks, maybe you're not dosing properly or not serving it daily. I'm ordering a bigger bottle this time now that I know that it works!!"
2,Ratings?,I don't understand how you could ask for a review. This CD doesn't list any songs that's on it. How do I know if this is the one I want?
3,Collects pet hair,"This looks really good, but don't buy it if you have pets. It collects pet hair very badly, and it is hard to remove the hair. I spend a lot of time washing, vacuuming, and rolling various pet hair removers over this fabric and nothing really works."
3,"Creamy, hydrating body butter","This has a slight, very faint odd odor, not quite lanolin or cocoa butter. I am rather picky about scented products - I prefer a ""natural"" smell of lanolin (even though it's earthy) and/or cocoa butter. This has some other added fragrance not natural. It probably isn't noticeable to most people who are used to buying popular off-the-shelf products and certainly does not linger on the skin.But it goes on nicely and is very thick and creamy. If you have dry skin, this is an excellent product to rehydrate your skin."
1,"Lots of mistakes, Do not buy it","After I finished the instructor-led training class for Oracle 8i exam, I read this book for test preparation. I found that some quetions are misleading and explanations are confusing. Don't waste money for this book, go to buy Robert Freeman's book."
5,There is nothing called Kashmir freedom.,Kashmir is a part of India and will be forever. So called freedom fighters are Pakistani terrorists.Do not forget that Pakistan is ruled by a dictator like Saddam.
3,Some of his essential stuff.,"""Peter Tosh"" has so many collections out, yet despite that, none of them seem to be perfect. This one does a fair job, though being from the ""Columbia Years"" means it's missing everything else. But this does have some classics on it, and of course everything on this is good. I myself might actually go for ""The Best Of"" or ""The Toughest"" instead. Decent collection though."
3,Compatability issues,"I'm sorry to say that even though I hold Edirol and Roland in a high pedestal, they're truely slacking by not providing drivers for the pc-80 to be supported by intel macs."
4,Not Rinaldi's best part 2,A story of the next generation of the women of the family from a Stitch in Time. Only read this if you have read the first book and please keep in mind that Rinaldi has written even better books than this so if this series is the first taste of her you have had there is better to come.
5,Outstanding collection,"First, I must point out the error in the Amazon product details. This book is not for ages 4 to 8. As pointed out in the School Library Journal review, the readability level is for grades 6 and above. I'm enjoying reading it aloud to my 8 year old daughter, who is fascinated by the fact that there was a Brownies children magazine in 1920. This is an outstanding collection and a ""must"" for every child's bookshelf."
3,Corded Phone with AM/FM radio-alarm,"The phone works great,along with the radio and alarm. The only draw backis that the led isn't bright enough, the ringer can not be turned down, and the buttons on the phone don't light up, so at night you can't see the key pad..."
3,Decent Card,The main event wasn't the one sided blowout that everyone says it was; but I would've like to have seen Jones and Evans try and go for the the finish a little more.The Eddie Yagin vs Mark Hominick match got fight of the night which I thought it deserved. The Matt Brown vs Stephen Thompson fight was my favorite though. Overall 8 of the 12 matches were enertaining to watch making this a decent card overall.
5,Skagen Women's Diamond Watch # 107XSSSBD,Nice Watch.Belt is little longer so if you have a thin wrist than you might have to adjust your belt buckle towards one side.And it may result your watch may not be at center after your final adjustment of belt.Overall it is a nice watch.
3,Its a good concept....but not for a medium to small sized rabbit,"I really wanted to make this bottle work, because of the easy open top and the very strong support it has to the cage. I have a rex/dwarf bunny in case ur wondering. The biggest problem with this bottle is the mouth piece is so big that when she gos to sip it, a huge stream of water comes out. I frequently found over the course of the few nights that water was all over that part of the cage. Only get this if ur animal is large and has a large mouth, if thats the case and its mouth can handle the flow of water, this bottle will be great."
5,Works perfectly!,I bought this for my 4lb maltipoo to keep her from drinking too fast and choking. The bottle itself worked perfectly. I didn't drip at all and let out the perfect amount of water but I couldn't secure it at the right height so she still choked on the water.
1,Don't buy Pop Religion,"Its quite simple really. If you compare John and Thomas, you get differences. John is the ""Philosopher's Gospel"", Thomas, the magicians.Before you start accepting this, read about the Gnostics, Manicheans and Marcions in a historical light, see all the things they didn't understand about Christianity, then read this and realize where it all went wrong.You might as well read the Apocryphal Acts of Paul and Peter while you're at it, they're sorta similar... the part where Peter starts flying is great."
2,Neither flesh nor fowl,"Although it is clear that Elaine Pagels is an admirable person whose views are interesting (when focused), this book is really a collection of fuzzy discussions loosely surrounding the development of the Christian canon. The subtitle would seem to indicate that it is about the ""Secret Gospel of Thomas,"" but the author quickly abandons that gospel, fastening on her subjects only long enough to satisfy the most uninformed interest.Pagels' personal religious perspective seems interesting, but even that is not well developed. Parts of the first section, where she is dealing specifically with her own struggles over belief in the face of losing a child are very promising. I began to look forward to a continuing discussion of her spiritual development set against scholarship about the Gnostic gospels and how they might affect Christian belief in the modern world.But this vein, like others in this very short book, fades out."
4,Concept of Jesus the son,I was expecting more about the Thomas's Gospel but it is more about the confirmation and struggles about how Thomas's gospel that was forgotten and Church's emphasis on John's gospel for the concept of Jesus the son of God.
2,Disappointed,"The Book title is misleading. I expected a book that provided insight into Thomas. Other than a listing of the Gospel of Thomas, there is very little about Thomas other than his disagreement with the ""author of the Book of John"". Ms. Pagels provides considerable discussion about ""John"" and about Irenaeus but nothing substantial about the Disciple Thomas."
2,billie,"This product took a few days longer to ship, and arrived, just shy of the 14 day promise. Which I had not had a book take that long to arrive. It's condition did not seem to be as good as what I was expecting, but definitely still in fine condition."
2,"All business, no technology. Bad business at that.","This is basically one long ""I Love You"" note to Ken Olson. There are little to no details on what DEC actually produced, just how great their management team was. And from talking to people that worked there, it wasn't as utopian as this book would lead you to believe.I would have given more than two stars if the book didn't have the word ""technology"" as part of the title. I'll admit, I was fooled. If you're looking for a book on how to write managerial process PowerPoints, this is a good start."
3,Good So Far...,"Yeah, I've only listened to it a few times since I heard these guys on MySpace, but it's starting to grow on me. I like the more poppy songs that they write in general, but it's good so far..."
1,useless for us pagans (or Jews or athiests or agnostics),"I'm looking everywhere for books that can help explain the senseless sudden death of my childrens' grandmother. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Since we're not Christians and the book relies entirely on biblical quotations to explain death and then tries to offer comfort by describing an afterlife in which we have no faith, this book is of little or no use to us.Too bad. The title is perfect. The contents, however, were not even a tiny bit helpful. Back to Freddy the Falling Leaf."
5,So Clear,"I really liked this book. In fact I wish I had read it many years ago . It would have made life much smoother for me. It is direct, clear, and opens up to those 'ah ha' moments that give clarity to working though life with a narcissit. It personaly helped me find logic, clarity,(even a little humor) and to understand ways to successfully and confidently work with this one certain person that is part of my family."
3,This book is about setting boundries.,"This book is about setting boundaries. Which is fine, if you are equal to the narcissist, or if you are in a superior position to the narcissist. However, this book is not relevant when you are subservient to the narcissist. If you follow the recommendations of this book when you are subservient, then the narcissist will merely see your behavior as insubordination."
4,Excellent book for those dealing with Narcissists,This book is filled with insight into life with the Narcissist. I found this book so informative...not only what not to do but steps so you can be proactive. I think it would be helpful to non-Christian as well as Christian. It is so helpful in validating your feelings.
4,Great movie...pity about the DVD,"This movie made by former Bond director Peter (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) Hunt and starring then 007 Roger Moore has all the hallmarks of a great fun action thriller. Yet, the action doesn't seem to truly pick up until the latter part of the movie when things start to go terribly wrong in a South African gold mine.The plot - for what it's worth - revolves around plans to increase the value of gold stocks by flooding a gold mine in Africa, and the machinations employed to keep the manager of the mine (played by Moore) suitably distracted and away from the location to allow the villains plot to succeed.A great cast supports Moore in this piece including Susannah York and Sir John Gielgud and it moves at a fair pace. The troubling aspect about this movie (and the reason I give it only four stars) is the poor treatment that has been afforded the picture on the DVD - it really does deserve to be redone and remastered."
1,"Great Movie - Lousy DVD quality, I mean LOUSY!!","I saw this movie many years ago, still a good flick! But the quality of the DVD is just plain LOUSY, audio cuts off as if the movie is ""censored"", color??? what color??? No big deal to spend $7.00 if you would like to see the movie but you sure do not want to include this DVD with your prized collection!"
3,"Not a bad yarn, acting is good","Not too bad. Susanna York outshines Roger Moore. A little long on the entry scenes on going down into the mine, but the film recovers. It ends nicely. If you want a plain old good Sat night movie at home with some popcorn, you will enjoy this one."
4,The Architecture of Country Houses,Great overview. Suggest to anyone wanting to revisit this for designing homes.
3,Too slow for an adventure novel,"Crown of Columbus had some funny, exciting moments, but not enough of them in this 500 page novel. The main characters are both academicians, so I can allow for some introspective monologues and analyses. But action does speak louder than words - especially in a mystery/adventure novel. The second half of the book picks up the pace and that's where you'll find most of the adventure and humor. The ending is a bit surprising and, for me at least, a bit confusing."
5,Leonardo da Vinci--A genius for the ages,"I first saw this drama-documentary more than 30 years ago on Armed Forces Television in Germany. I have been looking for it on tape or, recently DVD ever since.The film was made in Italy, I believe, and done very well. Leonardo da Vinci is shown through all the stages of his life, as a young boy, through his apprenticeship, and subsequent career as artist, designer, engineer, and advisor.Ever the curious, observant perfectionist, da Vinci watches the world and wonders why it works as it does. His efforts to make machines that fly, machines that are invulnerable to gunfire, walls that are impregnable, and art that sets new standards in the world, changed the way the world saw itself.Da Vinci remains, to this day, an enigmatic figure, misunderstood and aloof from the society he worked to improve.This is an excellent documentary for schools and families alike. I highly recommend ""The Life of Leonardo da Vinci."""
2,Disappointed in this one,"This is probably my least favorite Hardy story.It is packed with colloquialisms and obscure references, only the footnotes of which saved it.There was nothing especially compelling in the story for me to attach any real sense of interest in the characters, and no conflict so intriguing to make me actually care what happened next.It's worth reading to round out the more common miserable experiences of Hardy's typical characters."
5,You should know this record,This album really is just about as punk as you can get. I'm not being sarcastic. It's just how I feel. The word Punk actually has meaning here. With absurdist joy. Schlong's hardcore goofball drunken math spew deserves to be ringing in your ears if you haven't had the pleasure.
5,cute!,My niece LOVES Dora. This book will be a great addition to her Dora books. I think she will love it
2,Dora's book fell apart quickly!,"We received the Dora and my daughter absolutely loved it; however, the binding completely fell apart after about 3 weeks and all the pages started to fall out loose. We tried our best to save the book but no luck. She's not tough on her books but just by opening it a few times it fell apart; very disappointed."
5,Magical!,"A very cool movie, with lots of nice effects, great drawings, very interesting story and of course the atmosphere that it gives away is priceless. I loved it and so will many of others. Definitely one of the best!"
5,American Indian Prophecies,"Great Book for all Indian to read, and everyone else too. But only read it if U Love yourself. Aloh Mitakuye Oyasin!!!!Hugs The Spiritual Warrior."
3,Its OK,"I like the book for its thought prevoking theme, hoever it is very repetive in its types of information provided."
3,Bob,Very interesting Fairy Tale but not to be confused with real life. Several contradictions about peaceful indians who were at war with their neighboring tribes. Not what I expected but easy to read.
2,Skagen gold mesh watch,"Not only is this watch difficult to read the time....that gold toned mesh band is AWFUL and within a few weeks it looked like an old watch....the color faded off and it was truly ""cheesy"" looking- i tried to change the band with a leather one....ultimately very soon after- I gave it away....absolutely would NOT recommend this watch- frankly, I would GIVE it away if I won on."
2,Big technical error in painting!,"I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this! You can see from the cover photo that the sun is shinning on the mountains from the left side, but on the tree in the foreground it is shinning from, the right. This is a huge technical error that I could not imagine any competent artist making. She does not use a reference, obviously, because the sun does not shine from two directions.There also seem to be very rushed in a formula driven manner without any stepping back to reflect and make necessary changes. She says you can paint a good painting quickly in half hour. Maybe she can do her method in that time, but a good painting takes time to reflect and change along the way. In my opinion, she does not take the time to see what she is creating.There are some palette knife techniques to pick up, but I would not buy this video for any other reasons. It could lead a beginner in a wrong direction and has little good information for the experienced painter."
1,Not Bad Just Not Great,I watched this movie go on and on. The only truly interesting person they intervied about Bob's early Hibbing days was a school friend who was in his first band in high school. I just grew bored and I could at times supply more information than this dvd imparted. Also no music of Bob's is in here. When I saw MIckey Jones(World Tour 1966 see reviews) being interviewed any credibility this dvd had went right out the window. I don't recommend this to anyone. Read Chronicles instead if you want to learn more about Bob.
2,Very predictable stuff!,If your thing is fairly normal guitar scales over 2 or 3 note chord vaiations then this is for you. Boring as hell for me. There is a ton of other more interesting guitarist out there. Better try Connors in his ecm period...much more interesting than this.
2,Something is Missing Here,"I like to support the cause, but I expected more. The fellow did not cover the departure or homecoming of his unit. If the unit saw action while in Iraq, it wasn't shown here.The filmaker is back in Iraq, so we can hope that his next effort is better."
5,"A Turtle""s Tale",Your Kids will love this charming tale Of friendship and Love. Get it Share it enjoyed it your self or get 2 or 3 for gifts. Hours of fun they will want to see it again & again
3,Works OK,"Works good as long as there are no spider webs involved. Then the web has a tendency to block the openeing. Also, any spiders that can cling to webbibg are tought to pick up. But for most bugs, it works."
1,Don't be tempted,"Purchased 3 of them, and not a 1 worked right out of the box. A cheap knockoff of the discontinued Fellowes ones."
1,great idea but very poor quality,"I've had this type of mouse before and was very pleased with it, but this product is not very well made. I plugged it in and tried to use it. The mouse would move up and down faily well, but the movement for right and left was very erratic. the owners manual instructs you to remove the ball cap and clean the rollers and the track ball. After the cap was removed, I cleaned the ball and rollers, but looking closer at the drive gears for the rollers, one still has chunks of molding riser left on the gear surface which causes the gear to hang up as it rotates. The roller retaining springs do a very poor job of keeping the roller axles in alignment which causes them to hang up. no amount of cleaning will keep this procduct operational. If it would have worked out of the box I don't think it would have stayed working for very long."
4,Surprisingly easy to use,"I use a Logitech Trackman thumb-ball style track ball and have for years. It works great and I love it. I cannot use the finger-ball type as it makes my finger hurt.I got this for travel and so far, I find it works very well. The trigger for left mouse is easy to use and the thumb ball is reasonably smooth. Trigger and ball works easily for drag. The upper left button switches the ball to scrolling and that seems like a good solution (I use the the scrollwheel a lot on my my trackman).The two negatives I see with this:1. The long wire is a bit annoying. It is not that it is long, but that there is a wire at all.2. You have to set it down to type with both hands. For some things, I can use my left hand and that works fine. But setting it down for serious typing is a bit of a pain. But, for travel, it is better than than alternative."
4,Does what I need it to do,"I have an old desktop PC that I'm using as a server. It's jammed into a shelf with no mousing surface conveniently located nearby. Given the space constraints of my arrangement, this device was just about perfect for my needs. It has smooth motion and has given me no functionality problems. My only complaint is that the position of the trigger button in the housing feels strange; it's a small device, so when I squeeze the trigger I squeeze it with the inside of the top knuckle of my index finger, not with the pad of the finger. The throw on the trigger is a little stiff, so this is slightly uncomfortable.Not perfect, but more than adequate!"
5,Love this thumb mouse!,"This is my second thumb mouse. I liked my first one, I have MS and have problems shaking and using computer controls. The first one was made cheap and died quickly. So I have been hunting for some time to replace it. I found this one, and its heavier, made better, with the same features I need, plus some my old one didn't have. It scrolls, and is very comfortable. I am still getting used to it but I love it.Thanks.KR"
2,not sensitive enough,Trackball is not accurate consistently. Especially in the beginning it does not register your selection...as you use it it does get better. I need to use a trackball and have for several years. I never had this problem before and am quite frustrated by this one's performance.
1,Junk,"Skips, jumps harder to control than a room full of kittens.Good idea but would need to be made far better than this. Fun to play with, useless as a mouse."
1,Poorly made,"I ordered this mouse (trackball) and the model I received was FDM-G51 P (with a green ball, not as shown).It lasted a good hour or so, then the vertical roller stopped working. There's a very weak spring that holds both rollers against the ball, and there's more friction in the lube than there is between the ball and roller.Some models might be better than others, but if you can't trust that you'll get the right one, just stay away from anything that looks like this."
1,sucks,I got two of these both broke with in a few week of use one stop tracking left to right the other one just stop working altogether
3,Finger mouse,This mouse is a unique idea. It does take some getting used to. I find that I can work faster using a traditional mouse or pad. This mouse would be useful on an airplane or another situation where there is no surface.
2,could be better,The ball cover construction is very low. The ball falls out all the time. I like the hold but not the pickup.
2,Wore out in 2 weeks,"I like the idea of this mouse. It is comfortable to use, but the trackball was a little hard to move around. Over a couple of weeks it got worse: now the bll is kind of stiff and scratchy inside and its accuracy has suffered."
3,"Great concept, poor manufacturing","I love the concept of this finger mouse, with no table-top surface required. However, the motion of the track ball is so sloppy that I was totally frustrated and gave up on it. Maybe some other company will make a similar unit and do a proper job."
1,Poor quality,"This product One Finger Mouse, USB, Black is of poor quality. I liked the price and bought two of them. I was only able to use either one of them for about two weeks when the track ball would skip and freeze, The track ball on both units are now totally none functional. As usual you get what you pay for, in this case very cheap junk."
1,"Great design, poor quality = can't recommend","I stumbled across these generic one-handed trackballs when I discovered that the Fellowes Micro Trac had been discontinued. I loved the design and the Fellowes Micro Trac lasted a long time, but eventually needed to be replaced.I purchased one of these awhile ago, it was relatively well constructed and lasted about a year. That wasn't bad at all considering the price, so I bought two more the next time.I'm not sure what changed, but both of the trackballs were very poorly made. One lasted two weeks, the other about one week before becoming unusable. Basically, the rubber that contacts the trackball was low grade and the mechanism that holds the rubber was imprecisely put together.Unless the quality improves, I cannot recommend purchasing these generic versions, which is unfortunate because the design is great. Even if you've never used this type of device before, it feels completely natural right from the start."
2,One Finger Mouse,"This has the potential to be useful but I found the trackball to be loose and therefore hard to get the control I want from a device like this.I found the left-click trigger, inside the lower ring, to be convenient but it added to the problem because if your thumb was on the ball, it sometimes shifted when clicking.On the positive side, it is inexpensive and, for someone looking for a device to use with a laptop when there is no desk space, it could be just what they need."
2,Low Point for Enslaved,"After immensely enjoying the Enslaved releases Frost, Maradraum, and Eld, this album is a disappointment. It is a step towards hard edged rock music and a step away from their traditional viking metal. With forgettable riffs and an overall less dark and sinister atmosphere, this album let me down again and again. When they toured through the USA last year and they played half the set from this album, I found myself shouting ""play something older!"". Do yourself a favor and get into Enslaved as they are most fondly remembered. Buy Frost, or for truly black sound pick up Maradraum."
4,Seamless hits mix from the UK Garage scene.,"This ""mix"" by hit producers The Artful Dodger (the mix is utterly seamless and so probably done on a computer) is a primer for the latest in UK Garage which emphasizes the 2-Step beat that has taken over and transformed what was formerly (and inappropriately) called ""Speed Garage."" Be prepared for American-style RnB vocals, Ragga MCs, house textures, and the infectious 2-Step groove. Most of the scene's non-white label anthems are here along with a few 4-to-the-floor standards from '97-'98."
4,A Great Urban Story,This story has the 'mystery' feel and was enjoyable and easy to read. I believe this book has the potential to draw the male reader. My husband has read it and that is a step in accomplishing the goal of getting more men to read. I recommend that the women purchase this book for their male friends and family.
5,Harmonious Harmony,"After seeing Ed Ames on a PBS special, I became very interested in hearingthe Ames Brothers. What a treat! Some of the songs are a little bit corny, reflective of the innocent era, but the harmonies are superb! The CD is crisp and clean. I highly recommend it."
1,A Blank Performance,"This is surely the worst recording of a Handel opera. And Handel, of course, is not to be blamed! The performers are. The conductor employs a technique that has no historical support: the lack of vibrato in the voice. The result sounds dull and blank. Emotions, which are so common in Hadel's works, disappear all together. It sounds like a Victorian performance! The Curtis version is far more interesting, a real Handelian performance!"
1,Send it back next day,"I was really looking forward to this knife block since it had room for 2+ Chef Knife size blades and a cleaver. However I was very unhappy with the near garbage quality of it. The front section where the steak knives are held was glued on with a large amount of glue coming around edges and there were large gaps where it didn't fit correctly against the large part. Also in 2 of the slots there there large wedges that were hanging down that caught the blades and stopped the knife from going in. Also the the ""Wusthof"" that is shown in the picture as engraved into the block was not there. It was only a cheap metal sticker on the front where there name on it. I ended up going to Sur La Table, and purchased the same knife black but in the store brand for about $10.00 less just in a different color, and of much better quality."
4,Mon Amie la Rose,"This was Francoise Hardy's 3 rd Vogue album, originally released in 1964. It has also been released with the title ""Mon Amie La Rose"". All Hardy's 1960's albums contain several fine recordings; and this album is no exception. In fact it may be one of the most consistent. Standouts are hit-song ""Dans le Monde Entier"" ( All Over the World ), the Phil Spector inspired tracks ""Pourtant tu M?imes"" and ""Je N?ttends Plus Personne"", the acoustic ballad ""Pars"", the elegant pop-tunes ""Pas Gentile"" and ""Nous Etions Amies"" and of course the ""title track"" ""Mon Amie La Rose"".Hardy is an accomplished song-writer, and she wrote or co-wrote all tracks except ""Mon Amie La Rose"". Her acoustic guitar is audible on most tracks and the orchestration is mostly very discreet. There is a great releaxed feel to these early recordings and her slightly melancholy voice is moving."
2,"""We Package Only When You Order"" - NOT SO","Your product description says ""We Package Only When You Order"" yet the Garam Masala I received today is stamped ""MFG Date - OCT 2010""... I am not happy"
5,Great,"Exactly what I ordered and super fast delivery. So much easier than grocery shopping, expecially when its not a common ingredient."
5,Definitely Her Best!,"I loved this book. Barbara Kingsolver perfectly evokes Africa in all of its complexities in each of the daughters' voices. I agree that she can oversimplify the politics, but when stripped down the politics ARE as brutally simple as she makes them."
1,"not 5"" length but only 3"", so new car keys won't fit","This item is listed as 5"" in length. However, it is only 3"" long. Hence any new car key will be too big for it."
4,Good hiding place,I use this item for storing and hiding house keys outside in a toolshed. The magnet is pretty to ensure that the device stays securely in place and the combination lock just adds that one extra step of inconvenience if the wrong person should somehow find it.
3,Who Chose These Tracks?,"I finally got this because it was $5 at [someplace I don't want to name]. I avoided it for years because it had the NERVE to leave off the big hit (and only fast song) ""It's No Crime"". At 66 minutes, that and more could have been included easily. Comparing the track list to Babyface's list of chart hits, I see that ""Tender Lover"" (#1 R&B;, #14 pop) and ""And Our Feelings"" (#8 R&B;, #21 pop) are missing too. So is his last top 40 pop hit ""There She Goes"" (#10 R&B;, #31 pop), but I can't remember if the Sony/BMG merger--which would have allowed Arista hits to combine with the Epic/Solar stuff--happened before this CD was released.Still, three stars because what's here is first-rate '90's ballad and mid-tempo R&B;."
5,Music for many settings,"This is the first CD that I have purchased of this genre of music. I bought it as background music to my yoga/relaxation routine. This CD went way beyond that. Great music for massage, reading, enjoying the morning, even background to conversation. The music is, if anecdotal, stress relieving. I love it."
1,Don't waste your money,These are cheap Chinese bags. Buy the Swiss made that block 99.9% instead of 90& for a buck more.
1,It really bugs me.....,"It really bugs me when buying items on Amazon, it is not until after you've completed your order, received the automatic email order confirmation from Amazon, that a later email comes to advise that, gosh, we can't supply some of the items you've ordered. And by the way, you can't cancel that part of your order. I can't understand why Amazon cannot confirm the exact availability and delivery dates of items before finalizing orders. In the latest instance I have experienced it's only vacuum cleaner bags that cannot be delivered with my other items, but Amamzon's system is apparently incapable of completing this information at time of order. I have had this experience with several Amazon orders and find it quite annoying."
5,it's the...whatever,"I thought the song Whatever - was not only intellectually stimulating, but emotionally fascinating. I recommend it to everyone - I also recommend ""feva for the flava"" by Hot Action Cop- this song also emotionally spoke straight to my heart."
4,Pretty good,"Never mind the background music, the content is pretty basic and real good for absolute starters. Gets some real good basics down.."
4,Same old...same old...,"I thought this book was more or less a summary of the other three books about Shania that I have read. It did have a few new things that I did not know and the pictures in the book are great, but I wish it wouldn't have bashed her on one page and then prasied her on another. I give it four stars just because I love Shania and I really would read anything about her."
1,Not recommended.,"Don't buy this book. I can't put it any simpler than that. Readers who want to get a little more insight into Shania Twain's life will be sorely disappointed. The title of this book shamelessly touts that it offers an intimate portrait of the popular singer. What it is is nothing more than a compilation of quotes from interviews of Shania from her magazine articles and TV and radio appearances. Any Shania fan who can put a sentence together could have written this book. This book does not enlighten nor entertain the reader. Thus, the only reason I can think of for the author writing this book is to exploit yet another famous celebrity for his own financial gain. The worst crime of all is that he's done so in the most unoriginal way."
4,Getting There,"This book points out how Shania got to where she is and the difficultly that she had. All the book has is quotes from newspapers and articles. I feel the author could have dug deeper to find out Shania information. The author should have tried to talk to those who where behind the scences with Shania or anyone who was involved with her. This would have given the reader NEW facts! Even though, I feel anything that tells you about Shania is GREAT. I love everything on Shania so I cant' say that it is that bad."
5,Very Complete Background on Bester,"If you wanna know why Bester is the way he is, this book will tell you. You might even feel sorry for him at times, and will see things from his -twisted- point of view. If you liked Babylon 5 and particularly the Psi Corps episodes, I guarantee you're going to like it!"
3,Almost,"I read the book in the original Spanish because I live in Chile. Readers should be fully aware that much of the Chile that Allende seeks to describe has washed away with time. As with most nostalgia trips, the focus here is on hazy perceptions. Allende has not been chilena for a long time, if ever. She is arguably more californiana than chilena. In fact she was born and lived for much of her life outside Chile. So the title ""invented"" is correct, and perhaps the book could be almost considered fiction since there is no category called Invention. I suspect that most of the people who make comments on this book have never lived in Chile and have wrongly formed their opinions from a predominantly leftist press that also relies on invention and wishful thinking. The opinions about Chilean political circumstances tend to confirm that idea of invention Still, I enjoyed the book. Even a cracked mirror can reflect an amusing, if distorted, version of the true original."
4,Better then you would expect,"This book is loaded with knowledge. It has information on the different versions, and types of the book. This version, is quite unique, as even though it is translated, the orignial language, and hiro-glypics was left intact.I would highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in egyptian ages, but I would not expect just anyone to understand the true nature and power of the book. The book is extremly deep, and a few people might have troubles understanding it, But if you have an open heart and mind, then the nature and power of this book, is limitless. Enjoy it guys! :)"
1,Not the same as in the previews,"The book I got looks the same on the outside, but it's not the same as the ""look inside"" option on the Amazon page. It's more of an explanation of The Book of The Dead instead of the actual images and text of the book."
1,Not for young ones. . .,"If you don't mind your child picking up phrases like ""Shut Up!"", then you might enjoy this video. Otherwise, I would advise staying away from it. The siblings do make peace at the end, but I think the message might get lost on a younger audience."
2,Not what's pictured,"Years ago,I bought this product from a paint store-It was exactly the item pictured online. The Item I received, however had a much narrower blade. While this makes it lighter and easier to use, it does not allow for much material to be loaded onto the blade. The biggest problem though is, it is not the product that is advertised.Wal-board Wood Handle Blue Steel Taping Knife 24"""
2,borrow it from the library,"I'm not really sure where this book lost it's focus, but it did. Some nice touches throughout, but they were never brought together to create a complete enjoyable story."
3,Not one of my Oprah favorites,This book was slow in spots but I enjoyed reading about the girl's relationship with her family after the tragedy. I also enjoyed her friendship with Pearl who reminded her of her sister.
2,Not as good as expected,"Having read many of Oprah's picks, I had high expectations for River, Cross My Heart, but upon reading it, I was rather disappointed and confused. The imagery was well written, and the story-line had potential, but all of the themes involved were so disjointed that finishing the book left me with a very incomplete feeling. The back of the book describes the story as a tale of Georgetown trying to recover after the tragic death of a little girl, but it really isn't very accurate. Perhaps if the book had been twice as long, the plot would have been more full."
3,Average,"It was unfortunate that the main focus of the book was in the first couple of chapters only. I would have preferred the story to start six months BEFORE Clara died, to get more of an insight into who she was, before she was so suddenly snatched away and before we had a chance to get to know her. Perhaps then I would have shared in the heartwrenching sadness that Johnnie Mae and her parents felt. I found the rest of the story enjoyable enough, although there were lots of loose ends, too many questions and too many great characters I wanted to learn more about. (And I too wanted to know what happened to the kitten!) Pearl was very strange and her relationship with Johnnie Mae unexplainable. I didn't really pick up on how or why they became friends in the end. Anyway, an interesting insight into what life would have been like for blacks in the 1920s in Georgetown though and a quick and reasonably enjoyable read. But the ending really didn't do it for me. Sorry, but it made me cringe."
1,a River of disappointments,"Having read several of Oprah's selections, I naturally expected the same excellent, satisfying, well-developed story from this selection. Boy, was I ever surprised. This is a book that you force yourself to finish, just so you can move on to something else. I kept waiting for something to happen, as if the story was building up to some climactic moment...then it was over. There was no point, no moral, no peak...no moment of understanding, of real 'connection' with the characters. Frankly, I felt cheated."
4,true rating would be 3.5 stars,"This book does not quite deserve 4 stars and yet it's not a 3 star book either. Like the other reviewer I found it to be an interesting slice of African -American history. I found the characters to be believable and sympathetic. However, I also found that the story really didn't have much of a plot. It doesn't really lead anywhere and yet it does hold the interest of the reader. If this is your first Oprah book, don't give up. Her other choices such as Here on Earth, Back Roads, & A Map of the World are excellent."
3,Good read,"This book is a quick and very interesting read. I think that the author does a good job of describing Georgetown in 1929. I do not agree with reviews that have said that Clara was ""killed"" because of racism. Clara was a 6 year old girl who died tragically...no doubt about that. But she could have died at the ""white"" pool just as easily...she was a little girl who slipped on a log. She could have also slipped on the side of a pool. This story should be read more deeply than a story of a drowning and I think that the author does that in a very simple way. I think that this book provides a good read."
2,"River, Cross My Heart - Not What I Expected","Just wasn't what I expected. The jumping from before to after the death was very distracting. I expected more of a ""story"" after reading the back of the book... it said it was about how Georgetown dealt with the death of a child... it really wasn't about that much at all. It did have some nicely written, description moments... getting caught at the pool made my heart sink.."
3,waiting for something to happen,"This book was just good enough to keep me reading to the end. Several times I considered moving on to something more rewarding, but the subject of life among African-Americans in segregated Georgetown (Washington, DC) in the 1920s is such an interesting one that I kept waiting for this book to fulfill its promise.There's just no plot here. The book's focal point, the drowning of a young girl in the Potomac, happens right at the beginning. Then, people come to town, talk with each other, go to school, have babies..... this could be taking place anywhere. The characters don't have distinct voices. Possibly the most interesting character is Ella, who does country medicine, but we never find out anything about her as a person other than that she has a stilted way of speaking and an odd smell.I've probably read a dozen of the Oprah Book Club books and this is the first time that one has so utterly failed to carry me away. Ah, well. Has to happen some time."
2,Very boring,"""River, Cross my Heart"" has good intentions, but in the end the author becomes so filled up with self-righteousness that the text dwindles down into a mushy puddle. This is an ok book-just ok, and the reaon for that lies in the author's inadept execution. This book has HEAVY undertones of both Eudora Welty and Toni Morrison, but those inspirations are short and sporadically disbursed. For a long time NOTHING- absolutely NOTHING- happens in this book, and the reader is not able to derive any significance from the characters or what they do therein. Perhaps the author thought her prose too significant to be taken for nothing, but in the end this book is just a mass of dead ends and characterless characters, scenes that stop in mid-action and lessons lurking underneath the surface. If you like this book, I suppose an afternoon of watching paint dry is a favorite hobby. Oprah, you done wrong chile."
4,"No guns, incest, prostitution, child abuse or drugs!","I didn't anticipate liking this book. I typically don't like Oprah selected books and the book was classified in the ""teen"" section of our library. However, I enjoyed this slice of life story of a loving Black family who was coping with the pain/guilt of the death of their young child. They cared deeply and took good care of each other while coping with the frustrating, unfair social conditions of the time. The story was a nice change of pace from the Walker, Morrison and Angelou stories. No guns, incest, prostitution, child abuse or drugs, a daring feat!!"
3,Average book,This was an okay book to read. The characters were average and not magnificent. This review reads like the book: struggling to get interesting.
5,Satisfied with the quick response.,Received the item in 2 days! ExcellentWill not hesitate to order again.My wife likes it. Was surprised.Was a 'no special occasion' gift.
5,Fantastic and spirit-filled,"Total Praise Live is a fantastic and spirit-filled CD. The balance between contemporary (""Don't You Dare Give Up"") and ""old school"" (""I Can Do All Things Through Christ"") styles is nice, and some of the music (""Jesus is My Rock"", ""Another Chnace"") defies categorization and is simply wonderful! I have never tired of listening to this CD, and I look forward to the next release from this exciting and anointed group of musicians."
4,In case you don't recall...,"The ""laugh track"" has been removed, and it is not missed. I hated those on cartoon show. ""Recorded before a live audience""? I don't think so."
1,"No subtitles, no closed captioning. Disappointing.","These DVDs have no DVD subtitles or closed captioning. So if you're deaf or hard of hearing, stay away from this DVD set.It's surprising to see Sony make this kind of mistake, especially since they did things right and captioned the old VHS tapes released some 10 years ago."
4,Same old Moose and Squirrel,"I purchased this set as a gift for my husband. It's a great way to watch all of the old cartoons we both watched as children. We are second generation fans, and being so neither of us realized there is a story line to follow with each of the short skits. It's been wonderful watching them in the order they were made and understanding the whole story. Plus, the humor is even more interesting now that we are older and understand some of the political implications and satire we missed as kids. Two thumbs up."
4,R & B season 1,"It's really a shame that Classic Media didn't use the original season 1 opening/closing credits. Not only that, but they didn't use the original music either, because Jay Ward didn't own the rights to the theme and they didn't want to pay royalties to have it included. A real shame! Other than that, it's great set and wonderful to be able to see the shows again."
1,Quite disappointing...,"The diamonds were on the lower range described, Color I, Clarity SI2 (not really a surprise...) but the mountings were 14k and not 18k white gold as stated."
3,Item Description is Misleading,"I purchased the cherry flavor Betty Lou's bars from this same seller; the bars were delicious and fresh and the seller shipped quickly, but buyers take note: this is NOT a pack of 35 bars. There are only 12 bars in the box. Though the bars were very good, I would not have purchased them at that price if I'd known I was paying over a dollar for each small fruit bar (about 2 1/2 inches square.)"
4,david 1,i have justed started this series. i have read all the honor harrington series enjoyed them very much..this series is quite interesting because of the detail david weber goes into. i am about half way thru the book.i don't know how much good this will do you. when i finish by the end of feb i could write morethanks for askingdavid boice age [70]
4,Over all not bad,"It was a little slow starting out, and adding Sword Brother at the end was a little confusing at first, but over all it was a good book."
4,Well written fantasy,"I enjoyed reading this book. The beginning did not really grab me, but as I got further into the book and plot details emerged, I was hooked.The fantasy world is both unique and familiar. Elves, halflings, humans, and dwarves each have some slight difference that makes them unique to this world, and the ""Fifth Race of Man"" - hradani - are unique to this world.The struggles the main characters go through are believable and character building, as they wrestle with issues of morality and also in intense combat.Excellent read, and the price (free) can't be beat. This is the first book in a series, so you can see if you are likely to enjoy the series before purchasing anything."
3,Not bad,If you're looking for epic fantasy this isn't it. If you're looking for an entertaining diversion you've found it. It takes a bit to get into it. The book starts out as if you already know the main characters and the world they reside in. Give it a chance if you like the sword and sorcery genre.
2,Not the best reader. I have many that are much better.,Really uninspiring. Really not a good buy at all. By Courage to Change or Daily Reflections instead if you are looking for recovery readers.
4,"Great little printer, BUT...","My mother in law bought one of these printers for each of her kids. She also bought a jump drive for us to use with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with it. We are really disappointed about that, I'm even going to see if there are some special drivers we need to load or something to get the jump drive to work. So make sure your jump drive works with it BEFORE you buy it. Also, it doesn't work with my sister in law's smart media card. That was a bummer too. Other than that, we are very pleased with the photo quality and I'm excited to play around with all the fun software that's on it. We will be taking it with us on all our trips. I would've given it 5 stars if it worked with my jump drive."
5,Easy to use.,"I recently bought the A616 and it is very easy to operate, not complicated at all. Perfect size. This is definitely user friendly. The pictures come out very clear and nice. The ink cartridges are at a reasonable cost which was also important to me."
5,Great photo printer,It is so easy to use and the photos are high quality. I've have showed them to friends and they couldn't believe that I printed them and it wasn't done at a photo center. This is definitely a great purchase.
5,NSYNC IS THE BEST,JC FROM NSYNC IS THE HOTTEST GUY IN THE GROUP.HE GOT THE LOOKS AND THE VOICE.HE LOOK GOOD.I LOVE WATCHING THE VIDEOS BUT MOSTLY CUZ JC IS IN THEM..
2,Not one of their best performances or DVDs,"Very disappointing in many ways. DVD-wise, it is not a very long video and there are no extras. More important, the video quality is pretty poor. In addition, there are not many songs that are performed together, mostly just some song sets independently done by one or the other. They do have a very satisfying synergy when performing together, there just isn't much of that here. Billy Joel in particular seems to be very disengaged. I have seen several other Billy Joel performances that had a lot more energy."
4,Jimmy never hit a bad note in his life,"and this night at C.H. was no different. If onl the engineers had done a better job mixing this album! Surprisingly, we only get one Italian song but its a great reading of ""Vesti La Giubba"" and Jimmy really hits it! And that version of ""Little Pal"", well, Jimmy's never been ashamed to cry when he delivers a sentimental tune, and heres no exception...absolutely heart touching. His readings of ""A Fool In Love"" and ""Strangers In The Night"" (the tag on the ending should teach Sinatra fans a thing or two) are also top-notch. One of my favorite Jimmy Roselli albums, and I have them all."
3,Not much difference indeed,"This seems to be where Todd gave his vocal tracks to various other artists who then supplied the instrumentation. So the vocals are exactly the same, and the music, in most cases, has little added imagination. It's sounds a bit better on the second listen, but it's not really worth owning if you already have most of his other albums. I would have liked more of a remix album (along the lines of Patrick O'Hearn's Mixup, for example). It was especially sad on the song from ""A Capella"", which was done with all voice and no instruments. What's the point of then going back and adding piano or guitar?"
4,"Great Product, good value!","I just got a new electrolux vacuum a couple months ago and saw that there were three different types of bags that could be used. I have really bad allergies to dust, so the clinic bag seemed like the best one for me. I have used it many times since putting in the clinic bag and it seems to be great. Although, the classic S-bag was also great."
4,vacuum bags,The Electrolux bags are easy to install and remove. The retraction peice that covers the opening upon removal of the bag works consistently. I cannot smell and do not sneeze from fine dust/dog dander that can blow through while vacuuming.
1,A wrong choice!,"I was greatly disapointed in the offerings of this book. One glaring miscue is the fact that it has only one research paper as an example, and then it does not fully offer examples. In one case an inline refernce to a page is made in this research paper example. Yet, there is no refernce pointing to information that explains its format. In other matters, it is woefully lacking in the area of MLA usage and electronic mediums such as the Internet. The information provided is sparse and lacking. In addition it is poorly written and apparently was rushed to press. One would think there would be at least 4 or 5 examples of papers or articles in the book there is only one (pages 264-265)! And this one is so poorly done that it is a scandal that they have the nerve to publish this book as a refernce for MLA styles. Pass this book up or waste your money!"
1,"The eagle, globe, and anchor, 1868-1968",This book was poorly published. All the photos of the ega's are dark and blurry. I waisted my money on this book. Don't buy this book.
1,"Vest ok,Wish they sent the size I ORDERED","Vest got to me super fast BUT I ordered a XXL and even though the packing slip clearly stated Khaki XXL the notes said ""shipped 1 LARGE.I am a big guy, the large they sent is way too small, I look like Baby Huey and can't even zip it closed, Sending it back for the right size but I note the Khaki is no longer offered on the page. If they are out it's refund time"
5,Relaxing videos,I really enjoy the albums from Music for Deep Meditation and was happy to see this DVD with many of their music videos. I found the DVD so peaceful and calming. I often play it when people visit during the afternoon and they comment on how beautiful the images are and how calm they feel. I've even used it to help me fall asleep when I'm having trouble sleeping at night. The Chanting Om with the 7 Chakras video is perfect for sending me off into dream land!
4,Better durability than most .,"I'm currently on my 2nd Swiss Diamond 10"" fry pan, both lost their non stick ability at around 1 1/2 years, both were used daily, 2nd one was a warranty replacement after the 1st one failed, they are definitely durable compared to some of the other expensive non-stick pans I've had but in the end, nothing lasts forever."
4,Great Non-Stick performance,This pan was a replacement for our previous non-stick pan that was starting to shed its non-stick coating which probably did not add a lot of good flavor to our eggs. The Swiss Diamond came highly regarded on many Internet forums and has performed great. Our eggs come out just beautifully.
3,Two minor issues to consider,"I can't yet comment on the longevity of the pan's coating, but there are two features you should be aware of.First, the pan's diameter is only 24 cm, as opposed to 10 in (25.4 cm). Hence standard lids don't fit.Second, the tops of the pan edges are fully vertical, making it very difficult to drain off liquid while using a spatula to hold back the food.Update -- after 3 years of moderate use, the coating is still in great shape. (I do not use metal implements, nor does it go in the dishwasher)"
1,Fraud alert on Swiss Diamond products.,I was looking for a pan that does not have Teflon coating and my mother-in-law recommended this. After some research I find that this coating is basically Teflon... Check this site out.[...]
4,great fry pan,My wife and I love Swiss Diamond cookwear. My only complaint is the fry pan didn't come with a lid. I should have paid more attention when I ordered it but I didn't discover that until it arrived. You can buy a lid separately though.
5,"Quality pan, still going strong after a month","I'm very happy with the surface and the metal base (for heat distribution). I've used it about 20 times, cleaned it only with mild detergent, and I don't use metal utensils in it. Also, I don't overheat it and I use plenty of oil when cooking. My advice, don't treat this pan like it works miracles. Treat it like typical non-stick and see it work much better and longer."
5,"Connecting the dots, frames, layers, etc.","As much as the individual product documentation helps you learn the individual programs, it takes a book like this to really enable you to focusing the power of all these packages on DV and animation projects. It's a great resource for someone who is more familiar with using film make the conversion to digital video."
5,a little princess dvd,A most delightful classic children's story. Bought through an American friend as sadly now not available in Britain. Could hardly be bettered and still a delight watching it over 20 years later.
4,Oh Dear! - mixed feelings,"There is no question, in my mind, that this is the best adaptation of ""A Little Princess"". The casting and acting are great, the story is well told, and the sets and costumes support the mood and times very well. It's quite obvious that everyone involved took this production seriously.This DVD release is superior to the old VHS version in all respects except one: the original VHS version was 180 minutes (3, one hour episodes), while the DVD is 120 minutes (5, 24 minutes episodes). As a result of the cuts, the DVD version feels rushed. At times, critical character establishing dialogue has been skipped. I hope that in the future, this series is released uncut.Even so, given the cuts, I would still recommend buying this version: if you saw the VHS version, the clarity of the DVD is worth it; and, if you never saw the VHS version, the cuts are not so excessive that they degrade the watching experience."
4,BBC,"I stumbled across this as a child (c. 80s) surfing channels (when there were only four and you had to get up to turn a dial on the TV). I fell in love with it, and it wasn't until later years that I realized it was based on a famous book (which I loved too). Now, there are several renditions, but I still like this one best."
5,Was a 6 episode UK TV series !!!,"First of all, a word about British TV shows.A season as we in the US call it is known as a series in the UK. Most series of a show (esp. a new show) are of either six or seven episodes.This is a Londen Weekend Television production from 1986, and is in the original six episode format.There are not 30 minutes in each episode, because of where commercials apparently were.This allows for the original opening titles to be restored as originally seen. Some drawings of the characters are now seen for the first time since the 1986 UK run.But, this is very close to the original plot of the Frances Hodgson Burnett book.A masterpiece!!!"
3,Mediterraneo Boxed Set,"I ordered this set mainly for the soundtrack and I do love the sound track. It is beautiful music and plays perfectly. The DVD will not play. We get a message that it could not be played with our TV format. Not sure what that means but that has never happened with any DVD we have tried to play before. I am wondering if it has to do with being a foreign film format. Anyway, I debated on whether to return the boxed set or not but decided to keep it as we do have another copy of the DVD and I originally thought I was only getting the soundtrack anyway. The soundtrack is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Useful notebook cooler,"I purchased this cooler about a year ago to help cool my laptop. It has generally worked well to help keep it cool. It does blow the air up onto the bottom of the laptop, rather than drawing hot air away. On my Dell Inspiron, I've had to slide the laptop so it is over the right fan allowing it to blow through the cooling vent underneath the laptop.It has been getting rather noisy over the last couple of months, and the sound can be quite annoying at times. I never had any problems using the USB ports on the side, and it slides closed easily to fit into my laptop bag. I don't think it would work well on 17"" laptops.I have had good luck also using compressed air to blow out accumulated dust from the CPU cooler, which leads to an immediate 5-10 degree drop in CPU temps.I want to try the passive xpad cooler and see if that works better, by providing more space underneath the laptop for cooling."
3,Like ponchos?,"Good book, for knitting ponchos, though a lot of them were merely variations of others in the book. There are only a few capelet patterns, so beware, capelet lovers! There are no crocheting patterns in this book.The photography is very nice; I spent a summer in Santa Cruz, so I recognized the area! Each section of the book tries to teach the knitter to do a new skill, so if your skills aren't amazing, this would be a good book to hone them -- especially if you like ponchos!"
5,Love it,"I have read a lot of books on career change, but for some reason I didn't finished reading this one until recently..I must say that they provide you ways to evaluate your skills, strengths and personality plus other dimensions of career. I have a lot more understanding about who I am and it also make selecting a job easier because now I know what of my characteristics are negotiable or non-negotiable when I apply for jobs."
1,"An Insulting, Creepy Book","If you are one of those radical airhead humanists who are looking for ""a life that sings""; or if you are eight years old, this is a great book. If you are a grownup, you will find this book insulting and disturbing -- especially the occasional illustrations that appear to have been drawn by someone you really don't want to have wandering around in your house.It is probably necessary, given the subject matter, that books about self-fulfillment are a little hippie-wacky, but this one is intolerable. It is written at a very low grade level and that's not even considering the ooey-gooey tone."
2,Very wordy and not many new ideas,"I was really put off by the author's rambling style. He keeps promising that his methods will be earth shattering for the reader but I found that making lists of questions and then doing research to answer them, along with listing my inner protests for reasons not to try a career, was not very helpful for me. The later chapters mainly cover assessments such as the Myers-Briggs that one can find addressed more thoroughly in other sources. I agree with another reviewer on the point that I keep returning to this book thinking it will help me, but for me it is really a wordy recommendation on how to organize one's career research."
1,lacks direction,"I picked up this book at least 30 times, and put it down in frustration. The author seems to have a grasp of the intangible, but cannot communicate it. The book wanders aimlessly, lacks hard information, and is simply annoying. It put me right to sleep."
5,"Just DO it -- If you DO the book (versus just READ the book), you will be amazed where it takes you.","The book is not perfect.I found myself critiquing this idea or that section. But I wanted something to change, so I persevered.Still, while attempting to complete the activities of the book, I got to that familiar place in my life where I always seem to land --somewhere between ""stopped"" or ""stuck"".That is when the REAL Learning began.If you are ready for a breakthrough of an unexpected nature, pick up this book and go for it."
2,questionable,I am not sure that this is an original HUE product. The tights did not have a tag and it looked like were not in the original package.
2,Do not buy! They smell!,"The tights are great and well priced... however, unless you want to wear something that smells like a chemical plant on your legs do not buy. I read one other review (out of the 15-some that are posted) that said the same thing and wouldn't you know. I opened the package, noticed the smell and after 3 washes I still cannot get tights to a point where I would wear them. They are going in the trash. Too bad."
3,"I reluctantly agreed to watch it, but not bad","It looks like a chick flick, and it is a little. It was a good story though, well thought out, creepy and even chilling at times. Leelee is a little hottie and Stellan Skarsgard is always a solid actor. 3 1/2 stars actually."
3,"Not bad, but a bit campy and predictable","I enjoyed this movie, but I can't say it is one of the better movies. But it's not bad, really. I don't consider it a movie to buy, but maybe to rent. The story starts off with two orphaned kids going to live with their parent's friends, the Glasses. The daughter starts to get the feeling that something is not right, and as we (the viewer) can predict that the Glass couple have a dark secret... A bit of a campy thriller, but hey, I liked it!"
5,The Glass House,"I really liked this movie, It had suspense, mystery, and all the other qualities in a movie that anyone looks for. I have this movie, and I say it is my most favorite movie of all time! See this movie, you'll be addicted to it just like me and my grandaughter!"
2,You've seen better,"This film had an interesting premise. The cast was promising. The Glass House seemed like a fairly interesting little film.It was interesting in a disappointing sort of way. While the DVD quality was good, the actual quality of the story leaves much to be desired. The performances are OK, but the story waivers and is inconsistent, and doesn't adequately set you up for a lot of the plot points. In terms of a thriller, there are definitely WAY better choices out there. And a lot of questions aren't really answered effectively, so the plot can't chug along in the manner intended. That being said...you see the outcome a MILE away. But The Glass House just doesn't delivery in terms of a strong, well-constructed story that hums along and packs a punch in the thrills department.Really...watch this if you are forced to only. It's just a waste of time otherwise."
2,"So much fanfare, so little delivery...","I was hooked on the trailer, and I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, the best part of the film WAS the trailer. My problem with the movie was the convenient moments of incredibly nonsensical behavior. Just when a bit of tension was building, our heroine fails us. I watched the movie with a group of 12 friends, and we all were shouting at the film at the same times. ""Duh... call the police!"" ""Um, could you be any more obvious?"" By the latter part of the film, we were all cheering the bad guys on. Our reason? ""Anyone doing things that stupid deserves to get whacked.""Bottom line - Revved the engines but failed to engage the gears."
1,glass house?shattered movie,the glass house...smashes...this movie is so bad...if i could give it zero stars i would....there was nothing good about this movie except the ending...the characters were dull...and boring..the movie was dragged so much you could take the house away and bring it back and they still wouldnt be anywhere..if you want a movie that will put you to sleep this is it...dont buy this movie it is a waist of money...rent it if you dare...but be warned it is terrible....
5,Great little printer,"This small printer works great for 4 X 6 prints, I only use the H-P advanced photo paper, and have excellant results. Small size is a plus, and lcd display lets you eview photos before printing. My wife uses it for small photos (4 per page) for her illusrated journalling, and aslo to print out other journal material."
5,Spiritual meditations to start each day right!,"Hugh Prather's ""Morning Notes"" provides a short spiritual meditation for each day of the year. He points out in the introduction that the most important thing to remember as we set our daily purpose is to ask for God's help.The meditations aren't dated; they're just numbered from 1 to 365, so you can read them in order or jump around at random. They're a great way to start the day. He includes meditations on topics like:-- To be in God is simply to be connected.-- Kindness is the touch of God.-- I release you from your past, that I may see you as God sees you.-- I will give peace with my thoughts and cause no harm with my words.-- I am not a victim of my childhood.-- All inner shifts are reflected outward...and many moreAfter each short heading, he provides a paragraph to help that day's message really sink in.This is a really nice collection of meditations. They're quick, but they set a very positive tone for the day!"
1,"Might help ""extremely mild"" cases of depression","This book is highly ""opinionated"" in its information for people who are painfully suffering from the disease of depression. This first made me wonder what the author's goal of this book is. Then as I read along, I sensed a hungry urge of ""profit"" from the author. Of course there's nothing wrong to want to profit because we all need to make a living, but when I hit the end of the book, BAM!... a questionaire is offered to be filled out and mailed for analyzing if you want more information on how to treat your illness depending on if you are a Satiation type or Arousal type suffering from depression. All of this for a swell price... you are required to pay by check or credit card. As a person suffering from severe depression this book was an insult. I've read many precious books regarding this field and I'm always thankful to their authors but reading this one felt like a slap in the face. It's unfortunate."
4,Case Logic scores again,This is the second laptop case I have from Case Logic. I am amazed how much you can get in this thing if you need to. Good protection. Good size. Easy to carry. I would buy it again--no hesitation.
1,Sloppy and inaccurate throughout,"Although the author has some degree of insight into the process of creating musicals, it is mostly very basic information. And apart from that, this book is so filled with factual errors as to almost completely invalidate from serious consideration as a text on musical theatre. I hate to think of the amount of misinformation that anyone who doesn't know much about musicals would come away with as a result of reading this book."
2,Mediocre,"There is some good information in this book but it's also riddled with factual errors and a real misunderstanding of several important musicals. I don't know why this guy is writing a book about musical theatre, because he really doesn't understand the art form very well and many of the historical details are just wrong..."
5,Valve replacements for Sevylor inflatable boats,Decided it was prudent to have some replacement parts on hand. The Boston valves are also included in the Sevylor Spare Parts Kit.
4,Good book.,This book is about getting over the pain of the past and moving into your future. I recommend it to anyone who has a difficult time moving on.
2,How did this pass usability tests?,"When you close the filled case, nearly 1/2 of the trains fall out. Now how is that good design? Am I missing something?? Please, I want to know!"
4,if you're into exercise tape from the 80's,"i actually bought this for my mom because she had the exact same one that stopped working. she loves it, and uses it every day. it's pretty much like any exercise tape from the 80's. nothing fancy."
2,"CD yes, radio no","If you are looking for a CD player this is a good buy, great sound. On the other hand, if you are looking for a clock radio pass it by. Radio stations that I cannot get and so difficult to set the stations that I can get. Controls for volume and the radio are on the side and not easily accessible. You don't get your moneys worth on this one."
2,Okay...,"It's ok, I've had it for close to two years, and I need to upgrade. The CD quality is at times choppy, and the audio input is a disaster. Plugging in my iPod touch requires me to contort myself abnormally, and the ""beeping"" is very annoying. I normally wake up to a CD, but I don't hear the music first, I hear the CD player setting itself up. Not the desired effect.Oh, and couple other things: The CD player has been known to sometimes be very choppy and disturbing.The radio station is fine, but the fact that the volume and setting are on the sides does not help. AT ALL. I have big fingers so that's very hard to deal with. That's even how you change radio stations.And it does the flashing ""12:00"" thing during a power outage. If you live with a lot of outages, I do not recommend this. At all."
3,no headphone jack!,"It did not (of all things) have a headphone jack! It has worked well, but the description and pictures were not complete. I should have emailed this question, but all of my CD/radio players in the past have had headphone jacks."
3,Poor Radio Reception,"As a Cd player (& Clock/Alarm Device) it's very good. However, it fails as a Radio, as the AM reception is quite dodgie (Bad).The COBY CDRA147 DIGITAL AM/FM DUAL ALARM CLOCK RADIO WITH STEREO CD PLAYER - CBYCDRA147 was just the opposite...in fact the CD player would NOT properly play computer generated disc's. Had to return it."
4,Great alternative to waking up to a buzzer,"This clock radio is a great way to wake to your favorite tunes. Operation is straight forward and fairly simple. Sound quality is about what you would expect from a clock radio, I expected a little better since it's a Sony. The display has three settings. The dimmest works great at night but is not legible during the day. The brightest is great in the day but way to bright at night. The middle is good for day but still just a little too bright at night. I like a really dark room while sleeping but am only bothered by the middle setting if am sleeping restlessly. It does not work with WMA files and could use a battery backup to keep the time settings during power outages but these are minor issues. Over all it is a very good way to wake up and has many features to like."
2,sound is terrible .....,My old one sounded a lot better.!`....I actually play both at once 4 decent audio quality. Like the added mp3 player option.
4,An almost,"For the money I think the Sony ICF-CD815 looks nice and works well. I am satisfied and glad that I bought it. However in my opinion it is missing two things that would make the item better. First it does not have an audio out port so you are unable to listen to the radio or CDs using earphones. Second, the use of the radio would be enhanced if it had some station preset capability."
3,Sony Dream Machine Clock Radio with CD player,I was disappointed the the radio wasn't digital. It does work and wakes me up every morning at the time I have set it for.
2,it's ok,I read these reviews before I bought 2 of these cd players one for each of my girls room. Did not want to spend alot because I have had issues with dvd and cd players just stopping and no longer working and then I am stuck. I basically wanted something compact that will play a cd at night when they go to bed. Well I did not think through this bc I assumed that the cd player would have options to repeat automatically. This one does not so for my 9 month old I will have to go in to the room and press the play button again if she is not yet asleep and if she wakes up in the middle of the night there will be no miles davis to get her back to sleep. Even though this affects me and perhaps not those looking at this item it is bulky heavy and hard on the eyes. A bit outdated even for the price.
4,East to Use Radio,"This machine is easy use, with a great Large Digital Clock (adjustable brightness, 3 levels) readout. The switches for the alarm, radio controls, and volume are all analogue. However, Clock controls and on/offs for operation are all on top, and again easy to understand. CD, auxiliary (Sirius via Cell phone, and radio all produce an acceptable stereo sound. I especially like the adjustable Snooze...for those morning you know 30 would be better than 10."
4,A Very Good Basic CD Alarm Clock Radio,"I bought this to replace my ancient alarm clock and to double as a CD player in the bedroom. For what I paid for it, I am very happy with this product. A big bright display, dual alarms, and easy to use. Not only can it get loud enough, but the sound quality is not that bad. You can set a CD track as your alarm sound, which I love; hate waking up to an annoying buzzing sound, don't know how I put up with it before. The radio dial is in an awkward location, as is the volume dial; I guess Sony had to make room for the CD player on top. There is also a auxilary cable to connect mp3 players but I haven't tried to use it yet, as I didn't get this product for that feature. While a backup battery feature would have been nice, I knew what I was getting and cannot complain."
4,Complicated,"The Dream Machine does what a clock radio is supposed to do. It wakes you up at the appointed time. With all the buttons, it's complicated to use. Setting the clock and alarm times is a rocket scientist's nightmare."
2,Radio is worthless,"For my purposes, this radio has been useless. The manual tuning makes it nearly impossible to find the stations I'm looking for. When I do find it, I spend an inordinate amount of time turning my radio around, wrapping the cord in various fashions and other little tricks to try to keep it tuned in. I can't plug anything else into the outlet with the clock either, because that makes the station fuzz out.As far as an alarm clock, it functions properly. The CD player works, although I rarely use it anymore. Sound quality is decent considering it's a clock/radio."
2,not a great radio,"Since 1999 used a great AM/FM/CD Alarm Radio from this same manufacturer: ICF CD873! No Longer made, got this new one to replace the previous. The new radio/alarm has ONE asset over it's older cousin, a large numeric display. All other features are vastly inferior to the other model!"
1,I'm sorry I bought this!,"This unit doesn't have a backup battery. Therefore, EVERY time the electricity goes off, the time has to be reset. I'm not happy with this purchase."
2,Too little of most everything,I bought this unit several months back for my office. Its clock light is hard see unless the office light is office...which makes it a bit hard to work. The tuner is analog and to small scale to be able to get any one station easily. I have not tried the CD player yet. I happened to see this unit on Amazon while looking for its replacement and decided to rate it. Very disappointing for a Sony product.
2,CD Player Has Never Worked,"I ordered this to replace my old clock radio. I had had it for awhile before I tried the CD player. I couldn't get it to work. I read the instructions and did what it said but it would start to spin and then stop. I thought it must be me, so every time someone more knowledgeable about electronics came I had them try. No one can get it to play. Unfortunately, I have waited too long to return it and am now stuck with it."
4,"ANALOG tuner, and will not actually play MP3 CDs, otherwise fine.","I own one of these ICF-CD815 units, have used it for over a year. It's simple to use, and sturdy enough.The product description (unless they've updated it) says it has a DIGITAL AM/FM tuner, which is not correct. It's the low-tech analog dial; you have to ""tune by ear"" to get the station you want.The product description also ""suggests"" it will play a CD-R disk loaded with MP3 files, which is not correct. But you can play a CDR/RW disc burned in regular audio format, which is still fairly useful."
3,SONY ICF - CD815 AM/FM STEREO CD CLOCK RADIO,Good product for the price. Hard to see am/fm stations when scanning for a specific station. Volume control has poor location (rear of radio).
2,HUGE!,This alarm clock is very large. It took up a quarter of my nightstand! And the sound quality was nothing to brag about. I returned it. Not impressed.
2,lousy for audiobook listening,"Doesn't stay on same track when turned off (like car CD player does). Doesn't show how many minutes into a track you are, so you can't find your place easily. Volume doesn't go very high -- I listen while cooking/doing dishes, can't always hear it 3' away from me."
5,Just what I was looking for,I wanted a small CD player and radio for kitchen counter. I didn't want it to take up alot of space. This one is perfect. Is very clear and easy to use.
1,radio reception poor,no external antenna - will not pick up most radio stations inside my office building.
3,Product data incorrect.,Product does not have a digital AM/FM tuner as stated in the description. It is an analog one. Unfortunately this is one of features we most wanted. Very disappointed. Other features are very good.
1,very poor quality,bought this for my daughters room when she was born she is now 18 months old and the cd player is no longer working you can get the same quality for less than this. i would not recommend this product to a friend.
1,No battery backup!,"Oh, no! Add one more thing to the negative reviews: no battery backup! I thought every alarm clock had a battery backup so I didn't think twice when I didn't see that listed on the features. I just assumed it was a given. Not here. With this one, if the power goes out overnight, you're just out of luck. Isn't that ridiculous? This is definitely going back."
3,"ok, at best","is this what hip-hop is coming to?where is the leading edge talent?not bad, but there is better."
1,bad packaging,Product is very good but do not buy from amazon they do not reinforce packageand product breaks
3,Easy to assemble,"If you all thumbs, this is a great hummock stand. However, I am noticing rust starting already."
5,Blue muse by kenny Burrell,"If one is into guitars this is for you it can be played with the likes of Herb Ellis on the man with a guitar, thumbs up"
3,Kinsey without the kinks,"A dream cast for Cukor with individual bits surviving the choppy script based on Irving Wallace's trashy bestseller about sex surveys. Stereotypical suburban sweeties each offer up a different marital cliche and they're all pretty engaging, but Glynis Johns and Shelley Winters are, by far, the standouts. Leonard Rosenman's music a big highlight, too.The print used is grainy and dark, and not up to usual Warner archive standards for a 1962 film; still, it's better to have it on dvd than not."
2,disappointing,"My son was very excited to get his new desk, but the construction is disappointing -- the slats of the rolltop are warped and only held together loosely by tape. We therefore are not able to raise or lower the top. Very disappointing!"
5,In Fine Form,"You'd think there would be some vocal drop-off after performing for so long, but Annie sounds great on this cd throughout. She's hitting all of the notes, and I don't mean the engineer is helping her hit the notes. This is just as good as any of their GH packages, and you can tell the sisters are having fun the whole time, the oldies are not being sung against their will. I highly recommend this release if you'd like to hear Heart at their best, age has not diminished them in the least."
2,Too Far Out Of Date,"All of their material sounds terribly dated, this concert could have came from the 70's but not 70's Heart this sounds more like Southern Rock. Heart needs to reinvent themselves again and put out something with an updated image and sound. This lackluster performance will soon be forgotten and this cd will go out of print quickly due to not capturing many people's attention."
3,Much more than meets the eye...worth reading,"It's nice to see a 'money' book that's about more than money. When life becomes all about how to make and hold on to cash and lucre, something has gone wrong. This book showed how to rediscover things beyond office/work culture. Sure, make money and be happy - but don't think that making money MAKES you happy. I'm the child of depression era parents, and I know that money does not equal happiness.The financial terms applied to everyday life work nicely. This is a good way to teach people to be good to themselves and eachother again. I'm glad I got this."
5,perfect fit,the cover fits perfit and is the right price. it has been on for about 3 weeks now through 3 freezes 2 rains and high winds. it is still as snug as a bug. i recommend this product.
5,Learning with fun!,"I hesitated buying this game because it didn't 'look' very exciting. However my 8-yr-old daughter had heard of it and was so excited to start playing it. It is her favorite game and even her older sister loves to play it. Don't let the ""educational"" tool fool you, it's fun too!"
5,Great gift for my Grandson................,Great all round gift for an inquiring six year old Grandson. Very happy with this...........
4,Good game,"Even though my kids do not list this one as their favorite, I notice it still gets plenty of play-time. So... not sure what conclusion to draw from this!"
4,exceeds expectations,"This unit has great acoustics for the price range..i like the fabric woven cable,a reminder of a bygone era when this was a regular feature on electric cables.For my purposes it is just right..doesnt capture the llllooowwwsss of other high end units but does a good job overall."
3,Scoundrels,"Saw this show on the 24th of May 2005. Enjoyed the show. It wasn't the best but it was fun. In my opinion, you should see the show before purchasing the cast recording. (They were doing their ""Dirty Rotten Giveaway at the theatre and I got a complimentary copy of the CD) The recording also gives the ending away if you don't already know the ending. (The message from John Lithgow is pretty cute) Not the most memorable music but after seeing the show, you can at least think back to what was happening during each song and laugh a bit!"
2,No Meaning,I was unable to make out the purpose of that book. It's barely readable. I think RS himself didn't even know where he was going. Not consistent with a professional writer who has given us so many wonderful stories.
4,"GREAT Accessory, but Adapters are flimsy.",I purchased the kit to use to clean the undercarriage of my riding lawnmower. Great item to use because of the adapters to spray under the deck. After about six uses the primary adapter between the gun and the kit's pieces sheared the locking 'ears' rendering it useless. Adapters' locking tabs/ears need to be stronger.
5,AMAZING,"This is literally the BEST chocolate treat you could possibly buy (packaged). It tastes just as good, if not better than Reeses. Only 190 calories, opposed to 260 with Reeses, and it doesn't leave you feeling bloated and thirsty, since they have NO sodium. A less guilty way to indulge in chocolate and peanut butter."
4,Great varied Tiny Bell Trio,"""Constellations"" opens with the title track, a fairly straightforward catchy song. A lot of Dave Douglas discs start with a catchy one, and this is no exception. ""Unhooking The Safety Net"" has an Eastern European feel to the melody, and is free-jazzy. ""Hope Ring True"" is fairly free, though there's a theme running through it. You can hear very quickly that the band is very tight - this CD was recorded mid-tour. ""Taking Sides"" is a highlight with some great improv. ""The Gig"" is a Herbie Nichols song that's been delightfully dismantled and reassembled on the fly. I've seen a few jazz writers say this is one of the best CD's of the 90's. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the next three songs as much, taking this out of the running. ""Vanitatus Vanitatum"" closes the CD out in humorous fashion.If you like Dave Douglas, the Tiny Bell Trio, or modern jazz, I recommend this. I'm not sure it's one of the best of the '90's, but it's good."
5,GOOD BOOK,"I LOVE TO READ AND WHEN I BOUGHT THE BOOKS I ALSO HAD THE HONOR OF MEETING AND GETTING THE BOOKS SIGNED BY SANDRA WAGGONER, WHICH SHE IS A VERY NICE AND TALENTED PERSON. I BOUGHT HER BOOKS AT THE AMARILLO FAIR THE FIRST SATURDAY AND I READ THE FIRST ONE TITLED MAGGIES TREASURES WHICH I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BUY AND READ IT IS A GREAT BOOK. I ALSO HAVE STARTED READING SANDRA'S SECOND BOOK TITTLED IN THE SHADOW OF THE ENEMY. WHICH SO FAR I HAS BEEN A GOOD BOOK.I WILL SHARING MY BOOKS WITH MY DAUGHTER."
5,A New Momma,I loved that Maggie seemed like a real girl. She reacted in the same way that one would imagine for her age and circumstance. The characters were all believable which made me care how things turned out for Maggie. It was interesting to wonder what her treasure was. Actually she had two treasures. One was the one in the book and the other was the love she felt and the understanding she had at the end.
3,Autism group presentation ideas,"If you are in education, this book is probably not going to tell you much about autism thant you don't already know, unless you're new to the disability and teaching. However, I have found it to be useful for ideas I've used in planning some group presentions to be done for our studentassemblies about what autism is as I established Peer Buddy programs. There are some fun ideas for skits which help bring the concept of autism and what it means both for the student with autism and the students in the autistic student's classroom, down to a level elementary students can begin to understand."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed in the book. I don't like the fact that DYED REDHEADS are portrayed as ""Redheads"". I am a natural redhead, I have a son, a daughter and a grandson who are all natural redheads, and we definitely don't look like we dye our hair. By the way, the Judds are definitely natural brunettes. Just look at some old photos or videos! Some things were interesting, the folklore, history and old stories, but overall the book was a disappointment. As one of the other reviewers said, ""science can't duplicate what nature perfected"". She's right!"
3,Interesting,"Worth reading--it had interesting things in it that I didn't know, and that's always a plus."
2,Where are the other trains? An incomplete toy..disappoinment,My two year old got this for Christmas. It is a decent toy if you have all the trains or at least two.. the toy comes with one train. They are magnetized so that they connect together. Now I feel that I am forced to go buy more trains to make this a toy worth even having. My son sure isn't too enthralled with it as it is but I think he might like it with more trains. I'm not sure if they are available individually but online you have to buy a set of five and they are priced at $29.99 which is outrageous for five small toy trains.
2,Not Worth Buying,"This toy looks really neat. I like the fact that the track stores in the roof and there is a place to store the trains. However, during play the trains get stuck inside the roundhouse very easily. The door openings are so tiny that it takes adult help to remove them. I have to use the magnet from another train to get the stuck one out (something a child cannot do by themselves.) I bought this toy so my child could play with it while I am working. Since I have to constantly help to remove the trains, it is not worth the money."
4,Surprise Vocalist,"Joey D on the B3 is always a treat and it's hard to go wrong with one of his albums. The big surprise here is the real life identity of guest vocalist ""Joe Doggs"" who does a fine job with an assortment of jazz standards."
3,"Good airways, poor packaging","I paid a little extra for the -boxed- version of the 6 airway kit to pack in my EMT kit. Was disappointed that the box was twice as thick as necessary and they use a cheap vacuform plastic holder inside the box to hold the airways. Real estate in my trauma bag is at a premium and unfortunately the holder wastes a lot of room and it's not conducive to adding other things in the kit box. I've used the airways before and they're very good, just don't bother with the boxed set."
2,ok product for an awful vacuum,"The filters for the Oxygen vacuum seem to do the job, it's just that the Oxygen vacuum is the worst vacuum I have every used or purchased. I can not get the various attachments on or off the wands, then the heads make the wands fall apart about 10-20 times per room - get me some duct tape please!!! I needed something lighter weight and this does meet that standard and vacuum needed allergy filtration system and it does have that. It is so falling apart inefficient and picks up almost nothing - the flooring head is too wide and long for the suction range and physically just moves the dirt around on the floor.I could not recommend the vacuum to anyone...the washable filters seem to do just fine, but since the vacuum picks up nearly nothing - I may just have a lifetime supply on my storage shelf and only purchased 2. Now after a year of trying to use the vacuum it sits in the storage closet most of the time and I make do without it."
1,biggest waste of money,"I'm going to tell you the #1 way to save money, don't buy this book! What a waste! I was so mad to find out my husband got suckered into buying this. It found its way to the trash very quickly!"
1,you won't qualify,"lots of resources in this book but it's next to impossible to qualify for a grant unless you're a handicapped minority veteran immigrant over 65 who's homeless. waste of my money. i looked at EVERY thing cover to cover and nothing was going to work for me. only lesko is making money on this. if you're curious, go to the public library and check out a free copy."
1,Worse Than Useless: Misleading,"Lesko is one of the slickest scam artists around -- and he has been around for a long time, making it sound as if ""free money"" is just a phone call away, when the reality is quite different. For the more than 20 years that he's been scamming consumers with his seductive pitch, notice how he doesn't have testimonials from anyone who has benefitted from his materials. That's because the only one who's been getting money off this scam is Lesko himself. Shame on him. This book does not even deserve a single star. Unfortunately, that's the lowest we can go."
1,Free Money to Change Your Life,"Beware-this book contains incorrect information! I work for a city government office that enforces civil rights. Recently we have been flooded by letters from women (especially single mothers) who want to go back to school and are looking for grants. We do not provide any sort of grants or monetary assistance to either help people go back to school or start businesses. If this is the kind of information contained in this book, I wonder if there are other errors as well."
1,My organization is listed in the book...,"I work for an organization listed in the book, and we do not distribute ""Free Money"". We provide small business loans at a rate between a mortgage and a credit card, and I honestly feel bad for the people who contact me because they found me in this book.If you're looking for resources for a small business, there are plenty of names you can get without spending whatever this book costs. [...]This book must provide incomplete information, given that 90% of the inqueries I receive do not qualify due to location. As a neighborhood based group in an north-east inner city, we focus on our neighborhood and do not lend outside of city limits, let alone Tennessee.Save your money. Please do not buy this book. It will only make you look foolish to those you tell about it."
1,Oh.....Hell NO!,Not even worth the time I spent opening the cover. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. I hope my review keeps someone from being highly pissed and hurt to the core. How can a book so thick contain so much garbage? This book didn't tell you what to say and some of the contacts are wrong. I had one that I sent for info returned to me. Lesko is a BOZO!!!
1,Read this before you buy!,"... I am glad I did not order this book, I wrote down some samples ofcontacts that was suggested would help an african american woman tostart a small business. I say this, ""Wait for an updatedversion."" This is the millennium programs and contacts havechanged drastically. If consumers will stop sending this guy moneyfor an outdated book maybe he will realize he needs to make an updatedversion. You reviewers who say that anyone giving this book a badreview are not willing to work are mistaken. I am willing to work, Ijust happen to think $40 something dollars is more then I am willingto pay for outdated programs and information."
1,rip off or up?,"Sorry but this one is a let down. It is not enough to be black,Hispanic,Unemployed,Female or frog covered prince. To get any use from this book you'd need to be all of the above. I now know why Lesko is running in most of his ads. A moving target is hard to hit. Does he seem nervous to you?"
5,"Interesting, informative, and very useful.","What I liked best was the fact that you could get information on virtually any topic, including government programs, and it provides information regarding what departments to contact for various forms of assistance. Frankly, I have often found it time-consuming and difficult to determine where to call for the desired information or services. It is extremely helpful to have a source that gives one a starting point. Because the book is large and very heavy, it is very cumbersome and somewhat difficult to carry around. I like to carry the book that I am reading with me because, by reading on lunches and breaks, I can finish the book sooner. Due to the size of this book, I did not carry it with me. As a result, it took me longer to finish the book; however, the book was definitely worth my time and money."
4,Good Card For AGP Users,"In My Personal Opinion This is the best card for agp 8x that you can get at this time oct 07 best pixel pipelines ram and clock rating. I have tried s-video dvi and dvi to hdmi and dvi to analog the only one that I can tell a difference with is with the dvi to hdmi the resolution is not the highest it could be but, is still acceptable, but is still best for agp cards. I have fps drop speratically with dvi to analog but is expected with analog all and all I rate this card 4 stars it takes a lot to get 5 stars out of me so this is as good as it gets."
2,Bad Breath...the book or the cure,Not recommended.A rambling review of causes of bad breath with few helpful suggestions. Could have been written in half the pages. Seems that author needed filling to make book enough pages to satisfy publisher.
1,Buyer Beware!,"The rates advertised are not the rates that you are charged! I purchased a card and made an international call the next day, only to find that I was charged almost twice the advertised rate! Customer service's response was that the ""rates are subject to change."" Fair enough- then update your rates on your web site! Almost 5 days after I was overcharged the inaccurate rates are still listed. I will NEVER use these cards again."
4,This music is still OK,"I was listening to this record at the time of release, and after all thoseyears I'm truly surprised that the time did'nt change it a bit. It is still great, contemporary music, you can listen over and over !"
5,My favirote Beatle album,"Rubbersoul is in my opinion the best Beatle album of all 12 albums they made in a span of 8 years. Best 4 songs Nowereman,Michelle, in my life, and You won,t see me. The white album, A Hard day,s night, and Revolver are next in line for me. GodBless"
2,Prepare to Give Your Skip Button a Workout,"Playlist: Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, skip3 (You Won't See Me), Nowhere Man, skip5 (Think for Yourself), skip6 (The Word), skip7 (Michelle - awful!), skip8 (What Goes On - really awful!), skip9 (Girl), I'm Looking Through You, In My Life, skip 12 (Wait), If I Needed Someone, skip 14 (Run for Your Life - even John disliked this one).Hmmm...6 songs out of 14 warrants 2 stars. And none of the 6 is really a standout. No rush to buy this one."
3,AMAZON CENSURES THESE REVIEWS,"I wrote a review of this album in May. Because I don't think this is album great and I realize that the Beatles are highly overrated (...)There are great tracks on Rubber Soul but let's face the facts. They didn't have the vocal talent of Elvis, the ability to write lyrics like Dylan or could rock like the Stones. Outside of McCartney's talent at writing great melodic hooks the rest is very ordinary. Instead spring for a copy of Highway 61 Revisited, From Elvis in Memphis or Exile on Main Street you'll be very satisfied."
2,Rubber Soul,"While a couple of songs are OK, songs like Michelle and You Won't See Me are a disappointing departure from the music that initially made the Beatles so great."
5,Awesome Interim-Period Album,"This album came out shortly after ""Help!"", and was the mark of a change in the Beatles' way of doing music. The songs on this album are for the most part soft and introspective, particularly ""Norwegian Wood"", a tale of an old infidelity on Lennon's part. ""Drive My Car"" might be the most rock here. As a whole, ""Rubber Soul"" is very easy to listen to. Try to find who wrote the music and lyrics. Harrison and Starr had a bigger hand in this, I believe. That alone foreshadows the years to come, making it clear that these are no longer the neat-looking guys on ""Ed Sullivan"" in '64."
4,Good.,This was the beginning of the Beatles middle period. HELP! was giving the idea that they were changing. RUBBER SOUL was proof. This album has some great chord arrangements though.
2,Get Perspective,"Although there are some good tracks here, Think for Yourself, Word, Wait, Run for Your Life, What Goes On, and You Won't See Me aren't exactly chart toppers, and they comprise about half the album.Alternatively, Norwegian Wood, In My Life, and I'm Looking Through You help to salvage this effort. An honest evaluation says this is a 2-star effort at best."
1,Did I get the same copy as everyone else?,"I dont care if someone think I am wrong for saying this but I never felt there were any good songs on this album. If you want the beatles in their prime Buy ""ABBEY ROAD"" or ""THE WHITE ALBUM"""
3,Not the same as original US Rubber Soul,"For those of us that were there at the time the album came out, the song ""I've Just Seen A Face"" is sorely missed. It was on the original US release and for some unaccountable reason the much earlier ""Drive My Car"" is substituted. Why can't they just release these things like they were originally. I want ""Beatles VI"" for instance! Is this all Michael Jackson's fault?"
2,Beatles,"Easily the last of the major albums (I'm not counting Yellow Submarine) that I would recommend to someone new to exploring the Beatles' music. The first several albums, up through A Hard Day's Night, were great and I would recommend those highly. After that, maybe Let It Be and Abbey Road. The middle albums were among the least attractive, but even Magical Mystery Tour is better than Rubber Soul."
5,Favorite,"This album is fantastic. It seems to be the middle album between the era of the more ""Pop"" style of ""Hold your Hand"" and the more FM radio oriented acid trip stuff. It really is a historic piece because it does document a transition period. Besides.. Norweigan wood was the first song I learned to play on guitar so that makes this my favorite album."
4,The Beginning Of The Real Beattles,"Rubber Soul was the beginning of when the Beattles lost the suits, grew out there hair and started to play psychedelic music. This is not like the acid influenced Magical Mystery Tour, but it does have some trippy tunes. This is definitely a innovative album that set the future of the Beattles and the whole late 60's music scene. A must for Beattles fans"
4,"Some truly beautiful songs, not quite at peak","After the less than auspicious opening of ""Drive My Car,"" RUBBER SOUL hits its stride with the wondrous ""Norwegian Wood,"" the plaintive cry of ""You Won't See Me,"" and the alienation of ""Nowhere Man."" Things drop off a bit with Harrison's predictable ""Think for Yourself"" and the grating organ and high pitched vocals of ""The Word,"", but starting with cute ""Michelle,"" to the stalker's anthem ""Run for your Life,"" The Beatles are in top form. Playing with country, rockabilly, and even Tin Pan Alley, The Beatles really enter the realm of originals on RUBBER SOUL. While not as groundbreaking as REVOLVER and SGT. PEPPER, RUBBER SOUL definitely sends the message that this band is not really like anybody else."
5,The Most Important Beatles Album,"Rubber Soul is, without a doubt, the single most important album the Beatles ever made, if only because it signaled the group's shift from being more about singles and simple themes to a group about complete albums and much more complex musical themes. As such, the disc isn't as reliant on its hits as it is on the entire album as a whole. (Not that the individual songs aren't great; even the worst Beatles songs could easily be played on the radio with some regularity.) Between this CD and Revolver, you've got what is (or should, really) be the cornerstone of any music fan's Beatles library."
2,Rubber Soul,"I advise music fans just discovering the Beatles to focus on the early albums (up to A Hard Day's Night) and the last albums (Abbey Road and Let It Be). The middle albums are not as good, especially Revolver and Rubber Soul."
3,Be Careful. US Version is not the same as the UK even with remaster.,"I expected the remaster versions to be the same in UK and US, but they are not if you believe the track listings on Amazon.So, no 'Drive My Car' for us in the US. I think I'll get the UK version. (5 Stars for UK Version !)"
2,The Beginning of the Slump,"After the powerful early Beatles releases, followed by A Hard Day's Night and Help, the Beatles slumped into the world of acoustics, orchestras, and slow pop with Rubber Soul. Unfortunately, they wouldn't re-emerge as rock artists until 1968 with the White Album and then released Abbey Road as a farewell. Comprising the slump were Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper, and Rubber Soul was among the least impressive. With songs like You Won't See Me, Wait, The Word, Think for Yourself, What Goes On and Michelle, this is tough to get through. It really hasn't stood the test of time.Focus on the early albums."
1,Not the album I had growing up.,"The songs are all in a different order and I've just seen a face"" is not even on it. I don't know if it was a different release but the cover is the same. Very disappointing because the order of the songs on the album told a story, and this is just a mixed-mesh of Beatles songs."
1,THE RUBBER SOUL IS SO BORING.................,"Okay, let's get it straight! I listen to this CD from the Florissant Valley County Library only once because ALL of the songs are totally BORING! I don't think I'll buy this CD...maybe...........................MY E-MAIL ADRESS IS thebeatlesfantanya@yahoo.com"
5,Tobruk,"This book, Tobruk would have to be the best version that I have ever read and I have read a few of them. The detail that the author has gone into is excellent and has made this read a better read."
5,Mania,"This is one of the early Beatle releases that blew the U.S. market away. Beatlemania! Along with Please Please Me, Help, and A Hard Day's Night, among the Beatles' top albums.Enjoy the early days of the Beatles before they faded away into the over produced studio fare of Rubber Soul and Revolver that prevented them from going back to the stage until the rooftop finale."
1,Poor quality,"Like my dad I really love The Beatles but we were both very dissapointed when we sat down with a good glass of wine to listen to the CD we ordered. It didnt take long before we turned the CD off. Its was what we both called a ""flat"" sound. We couldnt believe we spent money on such poor quality sound! We compared the sound quality to the old tapes dad had and we quickly disposed the CDs. It wasnt only this particular CD. We ordered 3 CDs of The Beatles and they were all ""bad"". They were all lacking the sound depth. Just to compare we borrowed the same CDs from my dads friend, but recorded in 1994. Beautifull sound depth! Im sorry Amazon.com but the CDs does not deserve even one star for such poor sound quality."
2,"No, All the Beatle Albums Aren't the Best in Rock","This is OK, with a mix of originals and covers. If you want to hear what the world heard with the introduction to the Beatles you need to get this. Samplers like ""Beatles 1"" don't give that flavor.But don't get carried away. The Beatles are OK, but they were pioneers of rock only until about 1964, then started to get off track with Rubber Soul. 2-stars."
1,Weak,"This is The Beatles' weakest album. Seven Lennon/McCartney songs, one Harrison and the other six are cover versions. Isn't that sort of pathetic? I mean, the White Album had 25 Lennon/McCartney songs and they were almost seperated by then! Most of the songs are bad.""It Won't Be Long"" is alright. About average.""All I've Got to Do"" is horrible.""All My Loving"" is alright, sort of""Don't Bother Me"" is probably the best song on the album. It's Great""Little Child"" is good, too""Till There Was You"" is good""Please Mister Postman"" is dumb""Roll Over Beethoven"" is sort of bland""Hold Me Tight"" is the WORST song on the album""You Really Got a Hold On Me"" is boring""I Want to Be Your Man"" is too repetitive""Devil In Her Heart"" is boring""Not a Second Time"" is really, really boring""Money"" is excellentSo, in all, the only good ones are ""Little Child"" ""Don't Bother Me"" ""Till There Was You"" and ""Money""Not The Beatles' best work. ""Please Please Me"" or even ""Beatles For Sale"" would be a better choice."
3,Good and not Great,"Good first impression on the US market, but not as good as A Hard Day's Night. All my Loving is enough to buy this album though. It has I Wanna Be Your Man which made the Rolling Stones."
3,"With the ""un-mastered"" Beatles","What a crime against art. The music is great, the cover is a classic, but the digital production really stinks, even worse than the ""Please, Please Me"" disc. Shame on EMI/Apple and George Martin for settling for this kind of sound quality.01. It Won't Be Long - 10/1002. All I've Got To Do - 9/1003. All My Loving - 10/1004. Don't Bother Me - 9/1005. Little Child - 8/1006. Till There Was You - 10/1007. Please Mister Postman - 7/1008. Roll Over Beethoven - 10/1009. Hold Me Tight - 7/1010. You Really Got A Hold On Me - 7/1011. I Wanna Be Your Man - 8/1012. Devil In Her Heart - 6/1013. Not A Second Time - 10/1014. Money - 10/10This is obviously a 5 star album, but with such poor ""digital"" production once again, it gets 1 star. So that looks like 3 stars."
3,"Disappointed in the ""remake"" of Meet The Beatles","As Beatles music goes, this is still a great 5 star CD. Nothing but the best. As an attempt to re-release ""Meet The Beatles"" on CD (from the original LP) it rates a 1 star. Only nine of the twelve original songs made it to the CD. What a disaster, especially when a CD will hold more recording time than the LP. Songs left off the CD are three Beatles classics -- I Want To Hold Your Hand; I Saw Her Standing There; and This Boy. Why? I can't figure it out; especially since ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" made it to the new Beatles #1 CD. It's not because of recording time since five other songs were added -- again classic Beatles songs. This is great, but still why drop three classic Beatles tunes? This is room on the CD for all of the original twelve songs, plus the new five songs. Come on, EMI and Apple, re-release ""Meet The Beatles"" the right way."
3,Better In Mono?,"Although I have Meet the Beatles on 7"" Reel in Stereo from itsvery early release, I never bought the first 4 CD releases inMono. This is a Brazilian copy made in 1990 by EMI. So, maybeit was a better version. It sounds clean, full bodied. Naturalhighs and plenty of deep bass. The reason for me to change toMono now, I finally agree with George Martin on the oddity ofvocals on one track and instruments on the other, at least forthis one. Bought the remastered Please Please Me and find it OKin Stereo, don't ask me why. My guess is I didn't have a StereoLP version of PPM and only played the Mono version for 40 years.This Amazon buy was very inexpensive, brand new and arrived fast."
4,Important primary source,The seminal work that launched Gorbachev's reform movement. It is written by a young and enthusiatic reformer. This is before the setbacks and opposition to his reforms as being too radical or not radical enough ruined his career and sidetracked the entire program. This book is a good historical review of the failures of Soviet economic policies up to the Brezhnev era. It is an optomistic appeal to save communism by turning it into a socialist democracy. Unfortunately it didn't work out for him or his country. This book is a valuable glimpse into the man and his times and will no doubt become an important work in the historiography of the latter 20th century. Any understanding of the fall of communism and the collapse of the USSR is incomplete without reading it.
5,This book should come with a warning label.,"Euftis Emery's ""Off the Chain"", is just that OFF THE CHAIN. This book should come with a warning label, be prepared to go on a wild ride with this one.Depending on your preferences, you will either be turned on, turned off or turned out."
2,Very basic text,"Silliker maybe a good photographer, but he also is quite conceated (full of his own importance). The text often rambles to conclude a very basic comment. Some of the moose and white tail deer information is interested on a biological perspective.In short - he provides a few good points, but most of the information in this book is very basic.Save your money and grab a copy to read from the local library"
3,"MORE Gilmour, No Barrett","An interesting little movie soundtrack album from a band trying to find an identity. It's actually a pretty good album. Maybe not a 4 or 5 star one, maybe a 3 or 3.5. There are 2 songs that I love, Cymbaline and Green is the colour. But there is enough in this smorgasbord of a track list to enjoy the whole thing from start to finish. The instrumentals are interesting, Roger Waters folkie/ acoustic type number are good, and they even through a couple of hard edge rockers for David Gilmour to drool over and show his chops. They sound like that they were finally figuring what direction the band was going in and were on their way of making Syd Barrett's influence a distant memory. This is the first Floyd Album without any involvement from their founding member, Syd."
2,Least Essential Floyd Album,"Pop Kulcher Review: This is probably the least essential album the band released (not counting the post-Waters garbage). The album does include two signature pieces which stand out among their best music from the post-Barrett, pre-Dark Side era: the quietly beautiful ""Green is the Colour"" and the brooding, melodic ""Cymbaline."" The rocking ""Nile Song"" (and ""Ibiza Bar,"" a reprise of sorts) show the band had the ability to crank up the volume on occasion, but both grow tiresome after awhile. The rest of the album, however, is relatively forgettable; some pleasant instrumentals and enjoyable enough acoustic numbers, but nothing that rises to the level of the band's better work. Fans will obviously need to own it, but others should borrow a copy, tape ""Green"" and ""Cymbaline,"" and buy it only after collecting the band's other albums."
4,Maybe 3 1/2 for the third Floyd album,This is a pretty good album although it's one of the band's least remembered. I love the opening Cirrus Minor with it's far out sounds of birds acoustic guitar and keyboards-In a churchyard by a riverLazing in the haze of middayLaughing in the grassesAnd the gravesYellow bird you are not longIn singing and flying onIn laughing and in leavingWillow weeping in the waterWaving to the river daughtersSwaying in the ripples and the reedsOn a trip to cirrus minorSaw a crater in the SunA thousand miles of moonlight laterActually with the exception of The Nile Song and Crying Song this is a pretty good album and most of the instrumentals are very good.
2,Less,"2 1/2Floyd jam out a few decent tunes here but ultimately the laid-back vibe can almost double as an early career b-sides disc- in fact, you can actually hear them already borrowing from a few of their previous, more memorable freakouts."
3,2.5 stars,"A difficult album to rate, in that it was written to score a film and, if any limits can be imposed on Pink Floyd, this one has been. Again, flashes of future greatness, with Roger Waters doing most of the writing, but possibly their weakest overall effort."
3,More Or Less,"Pink Floyd's first foray into film scoring is a solid and decent effort. The album contains numerous cosmic sounding songs that were Floyd's specialty at the time, but there are some acoustic-based songs that are quite strong. They include ""Circus Minor"" and ""Crying Song"". Other strong tracks include ""Nile Song"", ""Cymbaline"" and ""More Blues"". More isn't one the band's greatest albums, but it is a mildly interesting affair."
4,Best misunderstood Floyd album,"I think even though this cd gets not the best rating,it is still a very stong cd.The songs range from blues and accoustic to raw psycadelic punkish songs.I personally thing that the nile song and ibiza bar is some of best early raw songs before punk was ever thought of.Cymbaline is a dreamy early bowish song that just flows.yeah there are some weal tracks but I think the rest of it more than makes up for it."
5,Bit by Bit,"I bought these bit to go with a newly purchased Router set.They are quality and a GREAT Price.My husband has tools, tools, tools and he really loves this set!"
2,Probably better than what you pay,"I was quite happy with these bits until the smallest straight bit broke off after cutting only a few mortises. Being the smallest of the lot, I might not be too surprised, especially when the same Freud bit costs $18 and this 15-piece set is only $40. Hopefully the others are sturdier and will stand up to the small amount of use they see. In the future I plan on buying better quality, but these may suffice for someone who doesn't expect much and won't be using them regularly."
4,Great bit set for the price.,This is a nice router bit set for a starter set if you don't have the cash to drop $30 on single bits. I've used it several times and these bits create a nice smooth cut on hard and soft woods. Highly recommended!
5,Great Bits,"I am new to routing and in fact had to look at the instructions on my Dewalt router (GREAT TOOL!) to make sure I was setting everything up correctly. The bits feel strong, are weighted well, and come with a very nice wooden case to protect the bits.I was putting a shelf made of a 1"" pine plank from HD in the garage. I decided to use the router b/c who cares if I messed it up. It was going in the garage. I studied technique online and it turned out great. My next project is to build a table from Aromatic Red Cedar for my Primo ceramic grill."
4,Problem with special features,"Some randomness last night, I was trying to watch the special features for At World's End, and the menu screen had options whereyou could select that would move the talking skull and crossbones to the top right corner as a sort of Picture in Picture thing. Then whenever I watched any of the special features they would only show up in the top right corner. Has anyoen else ever had anything like that happen, and where they able to fix it?"
3,Preview before your kids watch!!!!,The first scene of people being hanged is very graphic! It is followed shortly by someone being shot in the head and so on... I just want to warn parents who allowed their kids to watch the first 2 movies. This one is much scarier. I wished they had kept At World's End more like Curse of the Blackpearl - funny and exciting. AWE is much darker and scarier. Of course the movie is PG-13 (despite the heavy marketing of toys to kids under 10!) and they mean it this time!
3,Pirates of the Caribbean at Worlds End,"Loved adding this movie to my Pirates collection ... thought the crab/rock scene could've been shorter ... got bored during this part at the movie and at home. Otherwise, thought the movie was worth owning ... besides Johnny Depp could rock my boat anyday!"
5,Great buy,"This movie is awesome and it arrived in good condition. Johnny Depp is amazing, as always, and so is the supporting cast. What a great movie!"
3,"Nice effects, but not much of a story","Sure, it all looks very cool when there is a maelstrom, Davy Jones with a face full of tentacles, and thousands of crabs that help move a stranded ship back into the ocean. But this doesn't help the tired, third story in the Pirates saga. They could have cut the first 40 minutes, at least. The rest of it just isn't that interesting or compelling.The cast members do their best with what they are given, however, so I must give them some credit for that."
1,Please enter a title for your review:,"i enjoyed the previous two films but pretty much had no idea what was going on at any point in this one. who were allies, who were enemies, where any group or individual's interests lay, or what the point of most of what they did was, i.e. intentionally capsizing their own ship? there are about five lines of dialogue in the whole film that seem to communicate something about the plot, the rest is static. a waste of time to watch."
2,Pirates 3 - The End,"The final chapter of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy was not the best of the three. The special effects are good but they veer off into wierd places. I like Johnny Depp, but only one of him on the screen at a time is sufficient. I thought they could have come up with something more imaginative as an image of Davy Jones' locker. I did like how the romance between Will and Elizabeth turns out, very unexpected. The addition of Keith Richards and Chow Yun Fat to the cast is also a plus."
5,Pirate overload,"I pre-ordered it from Amazon, the Dad bought it at the store a few days later and the kid put it at the top of the netflix list. Result: Pirate overload. No problem during Christmas, just gave one away and returned the netflix. Was NOT as quick as buying it at the store the day it came out. Do not understand why."
4,Pirates of the Caribbean 2 disc,It was a gift for my grandson last Christmas. I'm sure he likes it as he was the one who requested it.
2,UGH,Shame on me for hoping for a really good third movie. Johnny Depp was absent for about 80% of the movie. It was slow to start and the middlewas confusing. The end of the movie made for a nice story. I gave it 2 starts because Transformers got a 1 from me.
3,A Shiny Swashbuckler,"Okay - this wasn't terrible. We watched it and thought, ""That was fun."" But for as much as we loved the first two films, it was sort of not how we'd hoped the trilogy would end.It gets REALLY hard to track who's double-crossing who in this film. YES, I know it's a pirate film, and that's the idea, but after a while one does need a bit more set-up to know who's fighting with whom or against which other at any given point.Bill Nighy is surprisingly subdued here, given his domination of the second film, while Geoffrey Rush chews the scenery almost as much as Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom becomes far more interesting at the end of the picture, and Keira Knightley does well in a poorly-defined role (is she a pirate queen or Aragorn? a rousing speech as the climax of the film begins to build leaves you wondering what movie you're watching).In a word, it's a swashbuckler of a movie - lots of flash with not as much substance as you might hope. But it's not a movie I regret having seen."
1,"not bad, not good",i went into the theatre hoping for a great conclusion. it was entertaining and interesting to a point...too many cliches happening for me though. i wouldn't pay to see it again.
5,"A LOVE TRIANGLE WILL BE RESOLVED,AND A SEA GHOST SHALL BE FOUGHT!","One of the main reasons i want to see the new movie from Walt Disney Pictures-PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN:AT WORLD'S END-is bc the love triangle between JACK,WILL,and LIZ will be resolved.i want to know if ELIZABETH will end up with the charming yet rogue JACK SPARROW or the charming yet smart WILLIAM TURNER.i think she'll end up with jack in the end.also there will be a sword duel between JACK and the evil ruler of the ocean depths,DAVY JONES,on top of the crow's nest on the ship!how does it get better than that?anyway i can't wait till' may bc it is the month of the three 3's(pirates 3,spider-man 3,shrek 3)and pirates is the best one!good luck to you matey...but i still have a question-why is the rum always gone?lol jk"
4,What extras??,"I am a big fan of K. Richards and a big fan of J. Deppand could watch them be pirates for the rest of my life.But this disc is way short on extras...I use the ""special""second dics as a coaster.Buy this movie but dont waste money on the 2 disc. Ifthis was not a gift - I would return it for the cheaperedition."
5,I dont understand the haters.,"While to me the second one was not quite what I wanted to see I thought this one was great. Its completley different than either of the first two which it should be. The first was a classic, but this one was also great in its own right. Its very hard for a third entry in a series to compare to the first. But I think this one was almost just as good, its very far fetched but then so is the whole story. It also looks very good on blu-ray. But people who hate this one probly just wanted to see more of the same and be like the first one. This is one of the best trilogies ive ever seen all three movies have a significant story and in my opinion the second one was the only one with no replay value."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End [Blu-ray],Great movie that goes along well with the trilogy. Alot of action and plot twist as expected. The Blu-ray technology allows for stunning picture quality and detail. This is a great buy.
2,"1 hit, two strikes","Movie three had awesome special effects. Movie three had incredible concepts and a very cool look. Unfortunately infinite money and technology cannot make a movie great on it's own. All the actors seemed to be forcing their performances and rang phony. Watching the bonus features was much more entertaining than the movie. In my opinion, the writer tried to tell too much of a story. Maybe there was just too much action and not enough acting. I just didn't like the movie and want the joy I had from the ""Black Pearl""."
3,Difficult to follow.,"Great cinematography but a little childish. The first movie was the best. The second one was good, but not great. This third one is mediocre, and some scenes just got on my nerves, especially all the little doubles of Captain Jack Sparrow. It was just overdone.I loved Sparrow in the first movie. In this third movie, it seemed like he had no role to play. He was just there. The writers should have given him more of a role and more dialogue.The whole movie was overdone with special effects, and this made it very unbelievable. The story is also very difficult to follow. The characters are not well developed, and some scenes are rushed.I think the producers got so overwhelmed with the special effects that they forgot to make this movie into a believable and easy to follow storyline."
3,Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End,Quite the let down from 1 & 2! Bad ending! Had to buy to complete the set!
1,Horrible,"I just finished watching At World's End and it was horrible. I am so glad that I rented the movie instead of buying it, but it was still a complete waste of time to watch. The plot was very confusing and the movie was way too long. Johnny Depp's character provides litte comic relief. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie was great and I have watched it several times because I really enjoy watching it. The third installment I could barely watch once. It really was horrible. The end hints that there will be a fourth installment and I know that I will not watch it."
1,Pirates of the Caribbean -At World's End,"This Movie is vary dosconnected and does not tie any of the events of the story together. It just leaves youwondering ""is that all there is to that?"" It is Not nearly as good as the other two movies. It is sort of like the picked dup the cutting room floor and mad a movie & said here it is. We all felt vary lost throughout the complete movie."
1,"Great movie but very, very poor shipping.",Ordered this for a Christmas gift. Placed order on 12/3 and did not receive until 12/26. Very disappointed.
2,just an excuse for another pirate movie,"Oh well. Always fun to see Johnny Depp at Capt. Jack, but other than that, not one of the better of the ""PotC"" movies. Pretty much bought it to have as part of the collection. Effects are cool."
2,Waaayyyyyyyy tooooooo looooooonnggg.....,"The Bluray version is one the best picture quality discs out there, of course. The special effects are amazing, of course. I loved the first and second Pirates but this one should have been a little more ""short and sweet"" to finish the trilogy. They had to make it this long (listed at nearly 2 hours 50 minutes but plays more towards 2 hours 40)?! It just does not have enough material and plot for the running time. For the first time in the series I was getting bored and just wanted it to end."
4,Better Than Dead Man's Chest,"At World's End was much better than Dead Man's Chest. Neither, Dead Man's Chest or At World's End, however can surpass the first. Sequels seldom do."
4,Another Great Pirates Movie,"While the movie started a bit slow which Johnny lost and all, it gradually became better and better until I was so into it loving every second. A wonderful great addition to my collection."
5,Excellent,It was here on time which is very important to me. It works which is what i was looking for
5,Pirates of the Caribbean-At World's End,"Although it has not been watched yet(it's a Christmas gift), we did recieve it quickly and it was packaged well."
4,Great debut novel,This book was had me from the begining. The diverse mix of characters were very well drawn. I don't normally read thrillers but this one hit the spot for me. Highly recommended.
4,"Perfect for ""banana"" babies","Because of height limitations, our first baby grew out of his SnugRide seat by 4 months old. We assumed our second baby would be similar in stature and bought this seat. He is now four months old and would have already grown out of the ""regular"" infant seat but, luckily, will be in this seat for another few months. It is REALLY heavy with our skinny 13 pounder but we don't carry it for long distances. It goes from the house to the car or the car to a stroller. He is very comfortable in it and it is easy to get him in and out. It fits in our Prius but the front seat has to be moved forward a bit which isn't comfortable for the grandparents but I'm usually sitting there and it doesn't bother me."
3,STEREO??????,"What's the deal??????CD is supposed to be remastered in Stereo. Love Me Do and P.S. I love You are mono. They don't let you know until you spend the money. What a rip. Two things to make these cd's worth the money. Repackage 2 albums on one cd, 2-Make available for Download,so you can pick the songs instead of a record executive picking what he wants you to hear"
5,The Beatles Please Please Me,The Beatles will forever be the best musical group in history. I listen to all kinds of music but there is nothing so simple and pure as putting on an old Beatle CD and remembering what I was doing when those songs were so popular.
4,Aiming to Please,"This is the first LP (long-player) the Beatles made at Abbey Road. Before making ""Please Please Me"" in 1963, the band recorded some songs with singer Tony Sheridan, and laid down a few tracks during an audition at Decca. Following their first single, ""Love Me Do"", this record would showcase the Beatles performance repetoire at this time. It features many of the songs the band played to their growing throng of fans throughout Liverpool. With gems like ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Love Me Do"", and ""Please Please Me"", we begin to see how the Lennon-McCartney song writting team would become great. In addition to these Beatles originals, we are treated to several covers like ""Anna (Go With Him)"" and ""Baby, It's You"", as well as an unbelievable performance of ""Twist and Shout"" by John Lennon. ""Please Please Me"" is wonderful rock and roll and fluffy pop. END"
5,Not into the early stuff but still a must have,"The early Beatles are fun to listen to only because they were new to music and the tunes were cute. Their early music sounded 1950's, which is the main reason why I gravitate towards their later work (from Rubber Soul on).The Boys harmonized like no one else could (then or now) and they took control of their instruments and their audience from start to finish.That's what makes The Beatles the greatest group of musicians ever (despite the uninformed opinion of certain folks who are desperate for attention and feel the need to post immature ""reviews"" that have zip to do with the Beatles' music)."
1,they make hanson look like legends,"oh,my god this album is so funny to listen to man,the WHOLE album sounds like hanson's MMMBOP. which proves onething the beatles suck get something else."
4,Questionable sound quality on some songs,"I agree with most of the other reviewers, for song selection this is great for a single compilation. However, I was not very impressed with the sound quality on some songs, especially the beginning of Sweet Little Rock & Roller, which sounds distorted as though the master tape was damaged. Also on some other songs (ex: Reelin' and Rockin') the sound is distorted on the low end, as though the levels are too high in the mix. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm actually wondering whether the copy I purchased is legitimate. I do not own previous versions so I cannot say whether this version is actually an improvement."
4,Necessarily superfluous,"Look, this is the same exact material that's on 2000's 'Anthology'. The only difference is the Gold collection is not chronological. So if you do not have or cannot find 'Anthology', then by all means pick up this one. You will not be disappointed. Why? Well, look up 'Anthology' and read my in depth review (I hate repeating myself!)."
1,You won't get a cable flex,Like others I received a single DVD no cable flex. Save your self the hassle of having to return the DVD. Look else where if you want a cable flex.
1,"It's 3 protectors, not 12! DO NOT BUY!","It lists as a 12 pack, but it's actually only 3. It has instructions for making ""up to"" 12, if each of the ones you need to make is only about an inch square. It's a misleading listing."
4,Cool shirt,"Arrived in timely manner. Cool shirt. I got the black version for my boyfriend last year after he asked for the blue one. He still wanted the blue one a year later, so now he has both."
2,Condescending in tone - but is it helpful?,"I agree with Pilgrim & Antonio on this one...A third of the way through & I'm not sure I can suffer the ""Advanced"" chip factor-relative to inherent value. Yuck!"
3,a good EP,"4 new songs, 2 duplicate tracks, 7 instrumental soundtracksIMO, 3 out of the 4 new songs are quite good. Perhaps it should be called an EP."
2,Would've been better as a 4-song E.P.,"The album's ok, but it would've been better as a 4-song E.P. That said, the songs are great. My favorites are the Harrison tunes, Only A Northern Song and It's All Too Much. All Together Now and Hey Bulldog are ok. For the completist."
