3,Freezes during notifications on base,"Was pleased initially with this basic PDA. Did what I needed which was setting appointments, editing/views Word Docs. Viewing PDFs to act as a e-book reader while waiting a various places. But it has begun to freeze each time it reminds me of an appointment while it is charging on the dock. Major blemish to an otherwise lightweight and handy device."
4,Picture not very good,"I thought from the photo the watch would have a brushed or matt finish. It is in fact polished on the case and band. A more formal appearence than I expected, It does appear to be well made and substantial. The band was a generous length, and I normally have a hard time finding a watch that fits me out of the box."
4,Readers of the Mahogany Soul Book Club,"The Great Pretender by Millenia Black was very fulfilling. This book is filled with many characters that each has their share of drama. Reginald was a married man caught in a web of lies who suddenly wanted to be set free. But, after six years of lies it isn't easy to start anew. After reading about the lives affected by Reginald's deception and the pain that he caused, it is still easy to have compassion for him at the end of the book. From this book we recognized unconditional love and the importance of honesty. This book is well written and we will look forward to reading the sequel! WWW.RMSBOOKCLUB.COM"
2,Just Average....2.5 Stars,"I expected much more from this book after reading the reviews, but to no avail. The book was just simply average. Nothing really came as a shocker (except one part at the end)and the message that the author was trying to make dragged on. I only continued to read beacuse I was curious to see how it would end. It wasn't the worst book I've read, but far from one of the best. Check it out from your local library."
5,Great book!,"The Great Pretender was a book that really made me feel. The characters were so real that it really made me think about my own life.Millenia Black is a great author that took an interesting idea, and made it into an intriguing story.And one thing about this book--I've never been so mad in my life (while reading) than when I read a certain part of this book. You'll just have to read it to see why!"
1,Disappointing and disturbing,"What a disappointment. The premise seemed interesting but instead the book turned out to be like watching a bad movie on Cinemax. Filled with trashy sex, undesirable people and a disturbing story. I'd say skip it."
2,Two Left Arm Straps!,"ok, gotta admit the price was cheap....but why send me two left arms straps. oh not only did they send me two but they sent me a left strap upside down an the left label part marked out an placed a red ""R"" under it... like i wouldn't notice it... liked the price but having a strap upside down throws off the way its gonna set on ya. Very important to have them correct. Its usable but its not what i expected."
2,ALICE pack frame,"As a Made-In-USA guy, I was hoping it was an authentic USMC/Army issue/surplus and would match my backpack. But it was made in China... :("
4,The old stand-by,"ALICE packs are the military standard, now replaced with the modern MOLLE system, but surplus gear is hard to turn down for durability and affordability.The frame and strap assembly is a key component to the system (can use the pack without the frame and waist support, but not recommended!) and the price and shipping were reasonable.Min arrived quickly and in excellent condition.I was pleasantly surprised to find that it even came with a sternum strap.The only downside I found was that my shoulder pads were cheesy woodland camo while the rest of my pack and gear is OD. Not a big deal - the serviceability more than makes up for the cosmetics."
5,Perfect for my kids!!,My kids love this DVD and play it over and over again!! They totally love the DVD and it has kept them so busy!! I just wish it had all of the songs on it!
5,Best Book on String Theory and its Limitations!,"I have a life long fascination with all aspects of Science. Although I am not a professional physicist, I have read many books on relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, and related topics. Smolin's book has emerged as my single favorite for one very simple reason: the realism and balanced view he brings to the subject. I agree with him completely on his analysis of the limits of current M-theory articulations and welcome his reassertion of the scientific method into the debate. If it isn't falsifiable it just is not science in my opinion. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been overwhelmed by all the apparent complexities of string theory."
3,Break the Mould,"I like the basic premise - scientific research has a vested interest in supporting its own favored sons (ideas), and has a great difficulty seeing or supporting new thoughts. As many out-of-the-box thinkers, I also have suffered this prejudice in my own field of computer science, and have spoken out on this subject ([...]). I really liked the clear demonstrations of the limitations, if not outright errors, in the established theories, but I didn't love so much the use of the book as a soapbox to promote the author's personal theories and preferences..."
4,wonderfull,I am really enjoying this book. Smolin takes the rather difficult concepts and get you through them with ease. I also found smolins desire to stay balanced and still stick to the precepts of science and scientific discovery as enlighting and refreshing.
4,Great budget watch,"Downside is the enclosure is plastic, not stainless steel. Another thing is that it is a little bit thick. Everything else works great."
5,Sharpe Strikes Gold...Again,This is easily one of my favorite books in the series. I highly recommend it.
4,Love the Sharpe Series,"Sharpe's Gold is an installment of the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell which takes place during the Peninsular War and one year after the Battle of Talavera . Captain Richard Sharpe is with General Wellington's army in Portugal where the British are in dyer need of money, food and supplies. Sharpe's mission is to steal gold to continue to fund the campaign. Sharpe finds himself stuck in the fortress at Almeida, Portugal and he must use all of his cunning to escape and help save the British army."
3,"Difficult, takes much time to understand.","The information is good, and looks almost exactly like Chian rong-qiao's form presented in his book.It took me a lot of time to understand this book, and unfortunately with such a complex art as bagua, you will find it hard to comprehend exactly how some of the forms are performed.In the fourth palm change, the spinning around to a point behind you is so obscure, you can be sure to throw in the towel right away.The rest of the book is great though, however expect to have to xerox the pages into a flip book to make it easier to work with when training, otherwise the book is so cumbersome it is rediculous unless you have book holders.I recommend getting park bok nam's 2 books on pa kua chang also, so that you can understand the concepts a bit better.Looking back I thought this was easy, but to a beginner, you might as well have cancer, as it is so difficult to start out with this book, as with any book, however by far this is one of the *BEST* I have seen."
4,Ain't no wimpy stuff!,"Wow - I dare say this is full-grain leather. My only down on this item is that it wasn't as big as I needed for my application. The piece I got was like 4' x 10"" to 9"" wide. Just a little too narrow for what I needed; however this is probably the thickest material you can get your hands on; I'd say it's belt-grade (in the leather world, it would be TEMPER:Firm or higher). I picked up a much larger remnant from [...] and it had a soft temper, and a very nice finish in comparison, but it was vastly thinner and nowhere near as strong. This stuff ended up working wonderfully as book cover material, (WITH NO BACKING!) It's that stiff and that thick! Best cut with a scrollsaw if you have it, otherwise either a coping saw or if you don't have those - get tin-snips."
5,So far so good!,No complaints so far on this pretty garbage can. I have a light cornflower color wall in the room where I put this yellow trash can and both colors go really well together. I love that the color is so different. So far the mechanics are working well and the trash bags come out of the liner very easily and are hidden from view.
5,Awesome Trash Can,I have had this for a while now...it is not only durable but it is also an awesome color. This is the most money I have ever spent for a trash can but it is well work the money. VERY DURABLE!!!!!
3,Arrogant or not there is no plot,"I borrowed the book from a friend thinking I was going to go home and learn some great dylan solos. the truth is it was a little dissappointing. the great thing about dylan and the harp is the rhythm he uses. I think you could pick apart the chords that he plays without the book. But we also cannot expect too much from tab books. the only way to learn some good solos is by the good old fashioned ear, and it really makes you a better harmonica player. The book is very simplistic, if you are a beginner than maybe look into it, but I have faith that you could jsut as easily go step by step and pick apart the melodies of bob dylan."
2,dry fruit lousy fruitcake,"Ive had Claxtonfruitcakes in the past. This fruitcake was the bottom of the barrel. How old is it? I bought three one pound cakes. I looked forward to enjoying these as in the past. The one I opened, was dry....I moistened it with Rum. Still dry, I drenched it with rum and, while the cake got gummy, the fruit stayed hard and dry. There was an abundance of raisins and currents (all hard). Fruits and citron were hard. Nuts hard and dry ( small pieces at that)..... Cherries were few...very few. Slices just crumbled into little wads because the fruit and nuts were so hard the knife wouldn't slice them neatly. I'd send everything back, but the postage isn't worth the bother. No more Claxton for me!Fruit Cake Boxed 3 - 1 lb Dark Recipe Claxton Fruitcake. Sandra C."
1,you get what you pay for,i bought this guitar for a beater but it isnt even playable .. it doesnt hold a tune. the action is miles from the fret board. its cheap woood with a bad finish and poorly made. if you want a cheap guitar front the extra 50 bucks and get a jasmine by takamine.. wonderful guitars. this things a piece of junk!
4,You'll be full of hot air!,"A simple although short exercise book, with only 70 pages.Yet the exercises are easy to follow, simple and very effective, I've got results just after two weeks!A very good book for those who want to increase their lung capacity and power control."
1,product came damaged,I was only able to try very small amount of this cream as the jar arrived broken. Better packaging might have helped or a plastic rather than glass jar.
1,Bummer!,"I had high hopes for this stuff, but I was allergic. I guess I had no way of knowing until I tried it, I don't have sensitive skin. I had nasty hives and swelling on my face and neck for a full week. More power to everyone else though that says it works for them."
3,miracle in a bottle,this really worked. my skin was soft and wrinkles were diminished and skin had a younger look. I saw results in about three weeks. Definitely would recommend this product.
1,Yikes! This stuff is terrible!,"I was anxious to get my jar of DMAE Cream, after reading so much about it. Unfortunately, I was not able to tolerate the stuff. I put some on my face prior to leaving for my hair appointment, and I was quite ill from it by the time I arrived. My stylist had to get me a wet towel so that I could wash it off. I'm not sure whether it was the obnoxious smell of it or if it contained some ingredient to which I'm allergic, but I will never risk using it again."
5,Comparable to High-Priced Creams!,"I recently tried a Lancome firming cream priced at $90.00. It was an excellent cream, but I didn't want to pay $90.00 for a one-month supply. I heard that DAME is good at firming the skin, and I found this one on-line. I absolutely love it!!!!!! It does as good a job as the Lancome high-priced cream at firming the skin... I use it on my neck and face during the day and it smells great too!I wouldn't be without it.."
2,No difference,"I gave this product 30 days. It has a nice fragrance and feels good. However, I see no visible difference from other creams of this type that I have used over the years. Also, it advertised ""high levels of DMAE"". Would like to know exactly where in the list of ingredients DMAE falls?????"
3,A Must for Morgan Fans,"OK I'm probably being too generous with 3 stars for this ""erotic"" thriller. Make no mistake, this is a poorly acted, directed, written, and photographed thriller that is seriously lacking in thrills.However, I'm being generous for the lovely Morgan Fairchild. While not an Oscar-caliber actress, she is a striking presence nonetheless, and anyone who enjoyed her vixenish charms on the TV show ""Flamingo Road"" will want to check this out.Ironically, both Morgan Fairchild and Andrew Stevens teamed up again years later in another similiar thriller called ""Body Chemistry III: Point of Seduction."" Also, Anchor Bay is planning on releasing this film late in 2005 on DVD with special extras; hopefully they will get interviews and/or commentary from Morgan...if so, I'll be buying!"
5,Great Addition to a golf bag,I recently received my unbreakable tees and they definitely are. My driver club-head speed average 110mph and i was able to use 1 tee for two rounds of golf and it's still in my bag. The only issue you may find is trying to find the tee if you knock it out of the ground because they will jump if you hit it right. Otherwise a great product that i highly recommend.
5,Golf tees,"These tees are simply the best. As advertised they do not break. Great product but a little pricey. I've used two from the pack and no matter how hard I try, they will not break."
2,Takashi has left the building,for me takashi has been on a steady decline in the last 3 yrs films like Izo and One Missed Call(wasn't bad) have really just tarnished his reputation as an over the top overly violent movie director and really thats why we like him. This movie is just bad for his standards not The Takashi that we know and love. Imprint for instance is one of his masterpieces Audition Ichi the Killer Dead or Alive Trilogy. Takashi used to have a way of giving a really deep story line masked behind graphic images that only he could deliver and i hate to say it miike you lost your touch.If your a fan of early takashi you will be dissapointed in this trust me.
3,I hope he really does becomes a star,"As My first Bowie book to have read I was thrilled to learn all I could. It gave a lot of information an David's life, but most of it was very nagitive! If this is the only David Bowie book you have on hand, read it. But if you can get a better, more recent one, I would suggest it."
5,Run as fast as you can!,"Run as fast as you can, and get this book! The illustrations are fantastic, and the rhythm and rhyming are far better than ""The Ginger Bread Boy""! I have purchased copies of both, and my 3 year old enjoys this one MUCH more! This is a book that every child should have in their room! Even if the ""Ginger Bread Man"" does get eaten in the end, he is after all, just a cookie! This is a fun book to read to your children, and I highly recomend it!"
5,Recognition of high tech workers uniqueness,"This book encompasses an all inclusive recognition of the 'techie' world; who we are, how we function and the leadership needed for success.Also, many of the management tools discussed are applicable to other business environments.Thanks for this understandable and informative guide to the uniqueness of our workplace environment."
4,Perfect,"Product is great, exactly as described and perfect for my Winnie the Pooh baby shower cake. However, I gave four stars due to the way the items arrived. 12 pieces were in a nice shrink-wrapped package, but the other 4 pieces were haphazardly wrapped in a wrinkled piece of foil. As this is a food product, I was a little wary and expected better packaging."
5,Too tempting!,"Bees arrived as expected, packed super securely and as pictured. The only ""problem"" is that they were too tempting, and my 9 year old niece picked every single one of them off of the cake and ate them...before we had even served dessert!!"
1,THE ABSOLUTE WORST HIGH CHAIR!,"The only thing positive is the neutral color and it looks nice in the kitchen. Here it goes: Like everyone else says IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to clean. There are so many nooks that food gets caught into that I have actually tried plugging up the holes with paper towel and then I remove the paper towel after every meal and set new pieces in the holes for the next feeding. The toys are worthless, you need strength to push the buttons and my 2 year old isn't that strong and even as an adult pushing them the rattles barely move. As another poster mentioned the tray is on a slant and everything slides to the lip of the tray even when everything is in the upright postion. It really makes you ask what type of market research they did on this item."
1,Not Convenient,I bought this product because it was supposed to be convenient and easy to use. Before I put it together I read the reviews of other users and found their comments to be true. It is very hard to incline and awkward to use with the tray in the infant recline position. It doesn't recline enough to feed an infant either. We are returning ours today and sticking with ourGraco which also has multiple reclining positions. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Didn't stand up,I bought this chair for my sister visiting for 10 days with her 8 month old. We could not get the chair to adjust right and the tray kept falling off. Food was trapped everywhere and it was a constant mess.
2,Poorly Designed Booster Seat,"I purchased the All In One Reclining Booster by Safety 1st and was extremely dissatisfied. This product was so poorly made. The backrest was supposed to snap into the back of the chair in three places. Only the left side snapped into place, the right side had a huge gap between it and did not line up properly. The ""T"" bar that is supposed to pop right into the front only worked on one side also. The toy that is provided on the tray is completely useless too. Difficult for an adult to push never mind a baby! A total waste of money and a big headache too!"
1,Don't buy!,As everyone else has said....the food gets stuck in the belt holes and you can never get it out! It's nasty! And my son always gets his ankles/heels stuck when I pull him out!The fisher price one is sooo much better!
1,Do your research,"If I had only known that I was going to waste $30.00 I would have gotten a manicure instead. This booster seat is insane. It does not fit properly on our kitchen chairs since the base is so wide. The flip down back support does not support my son and comes apart when I am feeding him. Luckily my son has not cut himself when getting in and out, but it is a trying ordeal and he always screams. The food tray is a piece of junk along with the entire booster seat. I too have limited space and thought that this would be my blessing disguise. Instead it is easier to sit my son in his car seat and feed him sitting on the floor."
4,A pretty good chair for a small space,"I was surprised by the other reviews. I love my chair b/c it's lightweight, easier to clean than a full highchair that would have lots more nooks & crannies, and takes up less space in our small breakfast nook. I found it very easy to adjust as long as Baby isn't in the chair."
1,Liked it at first but learned to hate it...,I got this chair as a shower present and loved it but when my daughter started eating table food I quickly changed my mind. The chair is wonderful for younger babies who just need a place to sit while being fed baby food or even cheerios but once we atarted on table food it was impossible to keep it clean. Food goes down the holes for the straps and is nearly impossible to get out (I even tried using my shop vac). Once my daughter figured out the food could fit down there she thought it was funny to put it in there. I ended up buying a new Fisher Price Healthy Choice Booster and like it much better. I would not recommend anyone spenmd there money on this product because it is unsanitary.
1,AHHHHHHHHHHH dont buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This thing is evil, every little bit of food my child drops gets stuck in the holes in the seat!! Who designed this??????? Impossible to clean!"
4,It's great except for 2 little things!!,"Like everyone else mentioned, the ""toys"" are worthless - unless you are a full-grown adult with leverage, they don't work at all... I just took them off entirely.The other thing is the rough edges around the ""leg bar""... I've banged her thighs more than once getting her out of the chair, and I'm always terrified of scraping her poor little legs on the rough plastic under the edge of that bar.But the space saving part of it alone is worth it!! It takes up no room in the kitchen, and allows her to sit at the table with us!I'm so glad we got this!"
1,Not good quality,"This chair is horrible. We bought it for our 4 month old and, like many other reviewers, we have to fight to adjust it. We were attracted by the reclining feature, but after the first use, we found that the edges are rough and the back keeps snapping out of place. The other thing is that right smack in the middle of the seat is a hard piece of sharp plastic sticking up. We folded up a receiving blanket for her to sit on. Whoever designed this did a horrible job. We threw the box away, but it's definately going back to Babies R Us."
2,Found a way to clean it,I agree with everyone's comments that this seat gets disgusting -- whoever designed it clearly doesn't have kids. I did find a way to get the food out of those holes though: Stick a vacuum cleaner hose into them. It's pretty gross to hear all of the food that comes out of there!
2,I loved it until . . .,". . . my daughter began to feed herself! Booster seats are the way to go, but only if they can be cleaned easily and this one can not. Tons of food gets ""lost"" in the two holes in the seat where the straps come out. I too have tried stuffing papertowels into the holes, but my daughter just picks them out. I usually have to get the vacuum out to clean the chair after meals. My daughter is 18 months now and the chair has served me well, but we are going to buy a different one, now that we know what to avoid."
1,waste of money,"I bought this high chair thinking that my son could use this for yrs to come, its going in the trash! The toys are useless. It is very difficult to recline the booster. Worse of all, all the food gets stuck on the bottom of his seat (by his tushie) where the straps are. You can't get them out! The only way to remove the food is buy disconnecting the seat from the chair and turning it unpside down! I'm on-line now purchasing another chair and I want all the Mommies to know, ""do not buy this chair"". It's a waste of money."
3,fun,My daughter put this on her Christmas list. We had fun looking at it on Christmas day. I don't think it will be somethingthat gets used over and over.
5,No more ADHD Meds!,My son has gone off his ADHD meds taking this and Source Naturals Attentive Child. The teacher didn't notice we had stopped his meds. No more fits of rage either. We are very pleased. Getting ready to order some more.
4,"Less quantity, but more quality","The 2002 version is much more user-friendly with its color pages and helpful organization than the bigger and less-organized 2000 offering. An added bonus for those looking to take the Microsoft Office Specialist Exam is the fact that this edition lists which core and expert objectives are covered when covering a lesson. Also, the interactive practice files make it extremely easy to follow and learn - for anyone.This book, in conjunction with the one by Barbara Clemens, helped me to not only garner Excel 2002 proficiency, but to become an Excel 2002 Expert. Now that I'm an Expert, I can tell you this book might be too easy for me - but maybe not for you. And that's the real deal."
2,Not that great.,"I thought that this baby bather would be great. My husband didn't want one AT ALL because he didn't want to store it so I thought this would be good because it folds up. My baby didn't mind it, but I hated it. I had a preemie and he would slump down in the seat because it doesn't recline enough. He would also slip to one side because it is very wide. Also, when it is in the tub, you have to fill up the tub all the way to get even part of the baby covered, so he was cold during the whole bath. When he was a newborn, we just laid towels out on the kitchen counter for sponge baths and now that he is older, it is easier to stick him in the shower with one of us."
1,Not so safe product....,"I'm going on vacation next week and purchased this thinking it would be the perfect thing. It looks like a really great bather...compact, comfortable for baby, easy to use....I thought my 5 mo. old would love it. Well, she's starting to roll over now and it turned out to be not such a great thing afterall. The bottom flap kept popping up and I had to hold my daughter down so that she didn't roll over and out. I'm returning it today....."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"This seat makes bathing even the squirmiest baby quick and easy. It's mesh, so it's not uncomfortable for the baby like the other hard, plastic tubs out there. When pouring water on the baby, it drains right through the mesh. The seat dries fast, and doesn't grow mold or mildew."
4,Grandson Love It,"My grandsons (3 and 5) loved the robot - its size, noisemaking and shooting. They were thrilled."
3,"I like the feeder but they need to find a better way to attach suction cups to it, not too stable on window.",The hook and slot system they use does not work very well. I can only get one hook to hold it on the window. The other hook is there but doesn't do anything. Other than that I do like the feeder.
1,Not Impressed,"I did not enjoy this book. With all the spelling and grammatical errors I found it difficult to follow. The author couldn't decide if the story should have been written as herself or Betty and it was evident throughout the book where there were references to both ""I"" and ""Betty"". I felt the synopsis of the book written by the author was misleading and a stretch. It wasn't spiritual, funny or educational. I didn't see any positive resolution to any of the issues presented. It didn't inspire me in any way as the author said it would. Betty didn't seem to learn from her mistakes.On another note, I had the pleasure of meeting the author and she's very down to earth and very accepting of criticism. I give Michelle credit for publishing her own book when others told her no."
4,"Very moving, a story we can all relate to...","I met Michelle back in the '80's when I was searching for a hairdresser who could tame my Innovations curl. While sitting in her chair or with the phone dangling from our ears, she'd replay these incredible life stories, and we'd laugh, and many times cry, together. Stories about the men she'd met and the children she was raising (or who thought they were raising her!). She'd always end with, ""Girl, I should write a book!"" Well, I was fortunate enough to read the preview chapters and couldn't believe that this lady who always had a smile to share could have survived through some of the most trying times and funniest adventures. Her story is like the lady next door. She's been through some ""stuff"" and we'll all see our lives entwined in ""All the Right Men."""
2,"Clarks Women's Cabernet Slip-On shoes, Black, 7.5 M","Although these shoes are wider in the toe area they still feel tight and they pinch. I hope that they will stretch a little. I have never had ""break in"" issues with my other Clarks. I have several pairs of Clarks and these shoes are not even close to being as comfortable as my others. Also, they do not look as cute on as they do off. When I am wearing them it looks like I am wearing a cowboy boot. I paid a lot for shipping or I would probably send these back."
1,"if your class is using this book, abandon ship now!","in a word this book is at best confusing. it tries really hard to be a good book that combines the theory behind how everthing works and how to become a competent linux user. unfortunatly, i'm not sure what these guys were smoking when they wrote this ( maybe some ground up windows cd's, since they're so good at linux they didn't need to buy any more windows products) anyways I suspect that the writers are much bettr linux users then they are writers. If you buy this book and it works out for you, thats great but I think the odds are against you."
3,"Come on Paramount, Quit Being Stubborn and Give us the Lucy Show!","Like everyone else who has reviewed this set, I have to agree that it is the best so far of what is available out there, but the quality is terrible. The episode selection is really quite good, with most episodes being from 1966-67, but would like to see more of the early ones as well as more from the 1965-66 season. I simply don't understand why they put so much emphasis on I Love Lucy and Here's Lucy, making available the best remastered versions of these, while ignoring The Lucy Show. This is the best and funniest series of all the Lucy series, in my humble opinion. I would like to see The Lucy Show released season-by-season and in beautifully remastered versions, like ""That Girl"", which was also made by Desilu studios. In the meantime enjoy this set, which for the price is the best choice for us Lucy Show fans."
3,LUCY FAN,"YOU CAN FIND MOST OF THESE DVD'S AT THE DOLLAR STORE,BUT IT WAS THE TIN BOX THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN- WHICH ARRIVED WITH DENTS."
5,A J Quinnell is a Master,A J Quinnell is my favourite author of all time. His ability to marry action/adventure while extracting deep emotion is unique. He has made me cry on a train in the past. He has a brilliant way with words - he constantly amazes me with his ability to get so much meaning in so few words in a way that I know no other auther able to do. I discovered him in 1989 with 'In The Name Of The Father'. I then went out and promptly bought every book he had ever written. I cannot recommend him highly enough. SnapShot was the next book I read and his story of Munger the photographer in VietNam is heartwrenching and the way the author brings two seemingly unconnected actual historic events together is superb. I cant say any more...just buy this book and while youre at it by all his other books - you will not be disappointed. If you do read any of his books please email me and let me know what you thought.
1,"POWERMADD 5"" RISER",GREAT BUT DID NOT COME WITH CORRECT HARD WEAR LOT OF MOD TO MAKE WORK. LUCKY I HAVE SOME MOD SKILLS
5,Excellent fragrance and value,"This is a well-balanced cologne. Good notes of spice and wood, noticeable but not overpowering. I am a fan of Burberry.I wore this scent one day when I was wearing a jacket. The next day I was wearing the same jacket, but not the cologne. No kidding, a woman in the grocery store came up to me out of the blue and said that I smelled good!"
1,FAKE / DUPLICATE perfumes on sale at amazon.com,I ordedred this perfume Burberry By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 OuncesBut to my surprize whenever I use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perfumes from vendors at Amazon.com. Its is total waste of your money.
2,sub par,"Went strictly with amazonian reviews... Last time I will do that again with colognes. really should have visited the mall or dealer to smell it first hand. I used to own Burberry Touch, which I really liked for a spring cologne but wanted something a little bit more long lasting. I gave this a shot and I was not only disappointed but it gave me headaches every time i used it. I know some cheap colognes do that to me, but I wasn't expecting this from burberry. The bottle quality sub par and the smell over the top! not sure if it was the spice used but in a closed door meeting at work I noticed that I started to have the headache and also noticed people inching away from the strong smell. And this is just from one spray to the chest under my shirt. I probably would put it up on craigslist for 10$."
3,Soild Effort,"This is a solid bit of historical reference. The book is well laid out and easy to use. It is not the ""complete"" guild but it does cover about 95% of what the general reader would be looking for. The items that are not in there would probably only be looked up by the real hard core World War 2 fan. I would have preferred a few more pictures and maps. Overall this book gives you what you need in an easy to use format."
2,Only if you love Andy Griffith,"Though this book should appeal to the Andy Griffith fanatics, novices should stay away. The book is not very funny, simply giving Barney Fife's views on dating, law enforcement, fashion and nutrition, as if Barney were speaking himself. Really not very interesting. However, the section on finance does contain sound principles as does Barney's arguments for a simpler life."
4,Chilling but leaves you hanging,"This was really enjoyable to read. At first I was weary of the surrealistic content, but I really grew into it.One thing though, I was kind of perturbed that it is very easy to get two characters, Keith and Rob mixed up. They are drawn almost identical, and I thought Rob was Keith at times and Keith was rob. Therefore, I was confused for half the story. Just remember, Rob has a small beard and Keith does not.Ending was what I expected, but I was a little disappointed, it kind of seemed to trickle out. Doesn't explain why or how certain things happened. However, this seems to be quite characteristic of this style of storytelling so I wasn't too surprised.I love the cleanline drawing style."
5,Shockingly Well Done!,"This is my first Charles Burns experience, and I must say, this is chillingly odd, erotic, and psychedelically-charged. The genre of art is hard to describe, but I'll try... it's a cross between punk rock and hipster with a little bit of LSD. I highly recommend this book. I wrote this review simply to have people tell what other books have this style of storytelling and/or art style. I love it. After reading this book I literally bought every book Charles did from Amazon and then his underground stuff on eBay."
4,Blackest Despair captured brilliantly in comic form,"Black Hole is a disturbing story filled with love, loss, transformation and the grotesque, but with a sense of hope as well. The art is stunning and the inking of each panel is particularly well done, giving a sense of darkness to each chapter in accordance with the title. If you haven't read it yet, borrow it, buy it, get your hands on a copy any way you can!"
3,It's alright,"I was hoping to find a CD with all of the greatest songs that I love. No luck. This is the closest thing to it, but still a little disappointing."
4,THE VERY BEST OF CHICAGO: ONLY THE BEGINNING,"I have always been a big fan of Chicago, and this 2 CD box set gave me all of their hits I have ever wanted to hear. When it comes to all of their songs over the past 30 plus years, I'm still trying to figure out what they're talking about in the song, ""25 or 6 to 4""."
5,No Question .... One of the All Time Great Groups!,"If you don't know about Chicago, you should!""25 0r 6 to 4,"" ""Beginnings"" and ""Questions"" are just some of the popular masterpieces. I saw them in 1997 in Fond du Lac, WI...hadn't lost any of their luster."
1,Climat 0.47oz. Parfum Splash for Women by Lancome,"My mother and I do not believe this product as authentic. The bottle packaging is strange and the fragrance does not last very long. The true product, we are familiar with, has much better attributes. We are disappointed and would not purchase this item again."
5,Ahhhh - relief,This is a great product. I was investigating affordable options for self massage after workouts (I run triathlons). This is exactly what I needed!! It is easy to use and easy to take wherever I go. Highly recommended!
2,Joseph Mastin did great things,"Joseph Mastin was an important figure in Virginia'a progressive era. He helped establish modern day social services, prisons and other reform efforts. This book can help anyone interested in Virginia at the turn of the century."
1,Slap bass lines,"Total waste of time this book in my opinion. Loads of pages with ledger lines on them( create your own tunes). What a crock, I bought it to learn. I bought ' slap it' at same time.... No comparison, full of slapping excersizes, the way a tutorial book should be. In conclusion, don't buy if you are looking to improve you bass skills."
4,Very Close to Being as Good as Their First Album,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by Caraluna. I have been following the music of Los Bacilos for years as they played the Miami circuit and adored their first album. I heard ""Mi Primer Millon"" and ""Caraluna"" live several times before I heard the recored version and though the songs didn't grab me right away, I love them now that I have heard them a few times. There is significant growth on the new album, a lot of fiddle, some tango ingfluences, and it is not as beautifully naive and basic as the first album but clearly these guys are working on a bigger budget now that they are touring like crazy with Alejandro Sanz and have one grammy nod in their pocket.Buy this album, you won't be disappointed, but the best thing is that it shows that these guys are not wearing thin and there is still so much great music to come. See Los Bacilos live if you ever have a chance. They are great in concert!"
3,Lots and Lots of games but analysis is not for a beginner,I was very impresed with so many games in one book. The analysis of games is over my head as I am just beyond being a beginner. If you are a collector of games you must own this book. If you are not advanced though get a book that covers games with analysis that is for you.
5,"Good, but left some other ones out.","This books certainly contains some of the best, most creative games ever played, but it left some other good ones out. For example, Karpov/Kasparov World Championship game 23 from 1986. The game with the famous Nd7!! and then Rb4!! Although they were sealed moves by Kasparov, it is an unbelievable combination...No games by Paul Morphy!! The first star of the game of chess has no games in this book. Also, Fischer/Spassky 1972, game 10. Fischer played, in my opinion, one of the most devestating endgames ever. Finally, Deep Blue/Kasparov 1997, game 2. One of the greatest players ever resigns in a drawn position! The game should have been in here for its historical value. Other than that, it is a good book for a reasonable price."
3,Manhunt in the African Jungle,"This is a typical cliffhanging serial with plenty of action and even good creativity, but ""someone forgot the jungle"". Its painfully obvious this was shot in the foothills surrounding L.A. and unfortunately every episode winds up in in the same old fistfight, usually between ""wolf"" the Nazi spy and Rod Cameron, the American hero, not to mention the spear chucking arabs, who also become routine and who are dispatched by the dozen, usually accidentally, by their own kind, during the struggle for the gun during fist fights. Okay, but no prize!"
4,Another great resource from Pinky,I loved Pinkys book Sleep like a baby so I knew I would love this book. It's a great common sense read that covers off on so many of the topics no one writes about. There are so may books on pregnancy but very few good books on life when you go home from hospital. This book gives me a greater confidence in being a mum
4,A bleak picture of women in Algeria,"A compelling but disturbing portrait of womanhood in Algeria. Told through the eyes of a spirited young woman who offers glimpses of potential liberation from the subservience of a male-dominated society. In the end, however, she seeks her future in a new relationship with a young man of unclear sexuality, giving up at last on her hopes of marrying the family man to whom she has been the mistress for the past three years.I was pleased to discover a film of this narrative and technical competence shot in North Africa by an Algerian director and I came away with a good sense of the flavor of some aspects of life in that country."
1,a leap too far,"the book tells a different story, true. but it tells it with such one sided-ness that it loses almost, if not all credibility. my history classes did not romanticize the idea of conquest. it was ugly, people died. they did not focus on a native point of view, but they also did not support the conquistadors views of savages, sub-human people either. it was a stupid excuse to do what they did, but wars are not built on intelligence, they are based on greed. it compares european conquest (or greed) to the tradegies of wwii (pure hatred) and thats a far leap."
1,Wild guesses are often inaccurate,"Though I obviously find it tragic that so many Indians died of disease, etc... in this time and that many blacks died from the slave trade, I find it morally reprehensible to exaggerate numbers of deaths by one or two orders of magnitude. Few serious scholars buy into these wild extrapolations."
4,toysmith kid's big tool set,"i ordered this tool set for my 3 year old grand son along with a wheel barrow. i gave him the wheel barrow which he absolutely loved and he asked where is the shovel. I decided to wait until spring for the garden tools. they seem well constructed but quite sharp therefore they have to be used with care and supervision only. they look sturdy and very much like the real tools.I know he will be thrilled to dig and rake in the garden when spring, comes he always wants to help."
5,Great for kids,"My kids have this set, and I give it as a gift whenever I can. Its great, a great price, well-made, colorful, useful, handy, just perfect."
3,"Not really a ""Kid's BIG Tool Set""","I love the hardwood handles and the metal ends seem to be fine, the biggest problem is the length of the handles!! I bought this for my grandkids and actually the tools are a little short for them. Had the handles been another 6"" - 10"" longer it would have been a great set...worthy of a 5 star rating."
1,Very small and taste bad!,"I never thought I would write a review about roasted and salted peanuts.Yes some are better than others. These are just really bad.When you open the OK looking shell you find small hard peanuts.There is also an unidentified strange taste. (Aftertaste?)After opening 6 or 7 and tasting them I threw the entire bag in the trash.(Well, upon further thought, I just took the bag out of the trash and will try to get a refund from the local store.)I have lived in various countries around the world and have never had peanuts that were so bad. Seriously.To be clear these exact peanuts, as picture, were bought at a local grocery store. ( 1lb size)"
3,Errors in kindle version,"I would have given 4 stars, but the Kindle version I bought has many errors, most of which cut off several sentences at the end of chapters every now and again. You would have thought the errors would be caught! If you want to buy the book and avoid errors, get the print version, not Kindle.This book provides additional ideas to help you understand why you might get caught in a ""pleasure trap""....any type of addictive behavior. Knowledge is power, and this should hopefully help you to add a bit more knowledge to increase your power to make good decisions for yourself and your body. However, it's not what I would call a 5-star book."
1,Flip is a Flop,"The hype is just that. Used mine twice and it locked up. I uploaded the software update, their idea of customer support, and it still doesn't upload all the video to my computer. What's worse, when you remove it from the USB port, you can't get the ""connected"" screen to go off unless you remove the batteries. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,Love this camera!!,"This camera is perfect for me. I have a lot of gadgets, but if they're not easy to use, I drop them and leave them to my more patient, adept husband. I love this camera. It's perfect to fit in my diaper bag, purse or just walk around with it tethered to my wrist. It's light weight, good quality picture for what the product is, and I never miss a precious moment of my daughter learning how to walk, talk or sing to send along to my eager family, or a dare devil bungee jump by aforementioned husband. It was SO EASY to figure out how to download the film, save it to my external hard drive and then upload to our blogs to share with family. You literally just stick it into your computer and it does all the work in no time. So much fun!!"
3,Great for a few weeks,"This camcorder worked great for a few weeks, was conveniently small, and easy to use, but then the LCD display would only show lines across the screen. So, I returned it for a full refund."
5,Flip Video Camera,Easy to use. Small and inconspicuous when in use. Great film quality. Excellent value for the price
1,Doesn't work,"I am ready to return this as it will not download to disc or computer. I called customer support and they were supposed to call me back but never did. Great if it worked, but very frustrating when it doesn't."
4,Love this digital video recorder!,"I bought this camcorder to take video of my son's wrestling matches. LOVE IT. It is so convenient to carry in my purse that it goes everywhere. It is simple to use and review on the camera or at home. The low price is a real plus.There are a couple of limitations. The sound quality is not the best, and it runs through AA batteries fairly quickly."
5,Digital Video camcorder,"We bought this product, Flip Digital Video camcorder for our sons, aged 35+, as a christams present. We were worried once we had purchased it as both of them have I pods and other camcorders. We had no need to be worried they were both highly satisfied with the gift, it gives them instant access, via the computer or TV, to the video they have just taken. It is so easy to operate just switch on and point. The quality of the recording is exceptional considering its small size. As we have just said, the beauty of the Flip is its small size, it will fit into a handbag , pocketbook, golf bag, beachbag or whatever you are taking with you. Think how many times you have seen something you would have liked to record in that instant and have not been able to, this solves the problem. Would I reccommend it? in a heartbeat. This is what we call value for money."
3,Flip Video Camcorder,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. It takes great video up close but is nearly worthless for anything over a few feet.. which I wish I had known before I bought it, since it was mainly to be used at ball games and band concerts.It is very easy to use, and is a nice size.. I would be much happier with it if it had more distance capability."
5,LOVE IT!,It even works before you take it out of the package. Edit by just draggiing the cursor to a start and stop point. You can also add your own music to the background of your video and it will mix your different videos together. This is really amazing technology for the price. An idiot could work this in the dark. Plus it works fine inside with natural lighting at night. It even zooms and weighs nothing. I've barely had a chance to really put it to use. Everyone is amazed by it.
4,"Simple and easy, good image and sound quality","Simple and straightforward. Would recommend it, if for simple daily out of the pocket use. Nothing more advanced.Sound is great, image slightly saturated but i like it, works well in low light, quite quick (2 seconds more or less from start to shooting), TV quality is great, application+driver are on the memory (no instal required), ...Downside: not enough configuration (no menu, not able to disable the sounds, ...). Able to take a still picture from the application (once camcorder connected), but not from the camera itself."
5,This product wowed me!,"This product has absolutely wowed me. Two minutes after taking it out of the box, I had shot a test video and emailed it to someone. There is essentially no instruction manual, but that's because a 5-year-old could figure out how to use this camera.What would you expect from a video camera that costs $120? I guarantee that you will receive more than what you'd expect with your Flip!I use my Flip to upload video blogs to YouTube to draw people to my Web site. It's absolutely perfect for that, or for recording basic videos less than an hour in length.Highly recommended, especially if you have a laptop (it plugs directly into your USB port - no cord needed)."
3,Pretty Okay...,I bought this camera and at first it seemed pretty good. They updated the program on the camera so that when you use it for the first time it asks to download an update. When you do the picture quality and sound quality of the videos you create are of very high quality. I can post them up on Youtube and it'll be High Definition. I use Windows and I believe most people who are having problems are using Apple. Now the program used to create and edit movies are actually downloaded from the website and not the small version stored on the camera which is really nice.However I was really dissapointed that the details said it's a 60-minute camcorder and mine only lasts for about 25 minutes. Maybe it's a problem with mine I'm not sure but that's a real letdown.
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"THE FIRST UNIT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DELETE VIDEOS FROM THE UNIT. SECOND UNIT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DOWNLOAD TO THE COMPUTER. CVS RX CHARGES $12.95 TO PUT VIDEO ON A CD.PICTURE QUALITY IS OK, BUT PICTURES VERY NARROW AND SOUND IS VERY POOR.WISH I HAD MY $100.00 BACK."
2,not too good,"for the price its ok-but no still photos, and the zoom is horrible- the usb gives a lot of weight to it when its plugged in. you get what you pay for."
1,Broke too quickly,"We bought this for our teenage son for Xmas and it was busted by March, although it had not received unusual use. We wrote the company and got some help that was not helpful. It seems that it is too fragile for real use."
5,Same product; new name,"Pure Digital has developed the Point and Shoot camcorder (Model 351) and this is their next generation product under a new name, Flip Video. There are a few new features, even better software, and increased video quality and performance. All in all, another great step forward. Why can't others do this?"
3,Easy to use but be careful.,"I purchased this camera because it was simple and compact. However, it may be too simple. I took the camera on my trip to Italy. After three weeks of shooting, I realized I had gone slightly beyond the 60 minutes (by 2 minutes). Instead of automatically stopping the process, it deleted my entire film except for those two minutes. When shooting outdoors, the glare of the sun does not allow you to read the settings. In addition, the instruction book makes no mention of this factor. I cannot express how disappointed I was to not have the film I shot over three weeks. There should be a feature that stops the filming when the 60 minutes is up and allows you to reset when you are ready."
3,good for the price,Just received and tested this product. Good to have when traveling light.Good quality and easy to use. Pretty good in low light situations. Only problems are limited zoom and very difficult to see screen in daylight.
2,Not what I had hoped,"I had high hopes for this camera after reading all of the reviews. Unfortunately, when I used it for the first time it froze, wouldn't turn off, and two pixels were lit up on the videos."
2,bad microphone,"This product is ok if you don't want to hear the other people in the room. Also, when I clicked on zoom, I could hear the clicks on the computer playback. (you have to push on the play button, more than once, to have it zoom in on whatever you are taping). It would have been ok, if not for these 2 things."
3,Fragile but fun,"This is my second one; the first one went hay-wire after a couple of weeks. I got a replacement in time to take some really great shots but then it dropped from my hand to a table, maybe, six inches and wham! it won't play now.I think it needs to be a little more resilient and able to withstand a minimal jostling around.Otherwise, it is really easy to use."
4,Great gift,"I bought this for my brothers birthday. He absolutely loves it. It's small enough to carry around and capture life's moments on the go.The only complaint is that once you upload the files onto your computer, they are too large to email out to friends and family. Otherwise, it's been perfect. I highly recommend it. The price was right."
2,Don't hurt your self,The camera is great but it's not working well with MAC.The worst thing about it is the package.It's not possible to open it to a point that a hurt my self really bad trying to open the product..Good camera but for a PC users.I hope Steve Jobs will come up with something simular that will fully work with MAC b/c we all know PC is s..t.
1,"Flip Video Camera Rendered Obsolete by ""Upgrade""","Since I downloaded the new version of software for my Flip Ultra, all of the video clips I download are in reverse order, making it impossible for me to conveniently make complete videos editing the clips together.When I downloaded video clips before and then tried to make a movie, they were all in chronological order.Now when I try to make a movie, the clips are in reverse order making it almost impossible to move around, especially when you have more than 20 clips, which I often do.If you stop-and-start and make 10 short videos to stitch together to make one longer movie, it's almost impossible because the videos are downloaded in the wrong order. So to make a coherent movie, you have to move the first one to the last order, the second video to the second-to-the-last order, and so on. It used to download in the correct order, but since this last ""upgrade"", mixes up the videos so they are unusable."
4,Flip Video Camcorder review,"The Flip is an awesome innovation. For about 90 dollars, you can't go wrong. It's easy to use, has nice resolution and is very convenient due to it's size and no need for mics and other add-ons.The one draw back is that getting vids off the Flip requires downloading software from the web and following several steps. For a computer novice, it might be a roadblock. They need to figure out an easier way to do this with newer models.But once we figured out how to get the vids off the Flip, everything was great. It's a really cool video camera and I highly recommend it."
4,Nifty camera,"Overall it works great - I wish I was more into doing videos, I take it with me and forget to use it half the time - LOL.The only negative is that the movie-making software that is comes with really sucks - very limited."
4,Funny,This show is funny. It is of course outrageous and ridiculous but if you like that sense of humor. All the actors are excellent. This is a must for the 3RFRS fans. Only complaint I had was the bonus features. you would think for a final season they would have good bonuses. I love the goofs/outtakes etc and was looking forward to that on this DVD (this feature is on other seasons) but it was lacking. I was sad about that but as far as the show it is great
1,CONFUSION,please note that the album titled VITTORIO is essentially the same album as IN THE HANDS OF LOVE. There is a difference of two songs.PLEASE DON'T THINK - AS I DID- THAT THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO DIFFERENT ALBUMS! tHEY ARE NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,One trick pony,"One-Horse Railroad is a professionally produced video that goes into detail about the South Pacific Coast Railroad. I wish there were more video of the train ride, which is what I bought it for. It's a spectacular ride even today over the route from Felton to Santa Cruz. The ride through the tunnels must have been something else.We also don't see all the existing tunnel entrances, but we do see a couple. I especially appreciated the personal accounts of riding the train to school from Laurel.We see Bruce MacGregor on film, which is remarkable because he is the author of several books on the railroad. He tried, unsuccessfully, to generate interest in reviving the line."
4,they do it again,"Strung Out has always been one of my favorite Fat Wreck bands and American Paradox is another fine release. I am pretty bored with the Fat Wreck sound, but this band just blows me away. They are technical, fast, melodic, and much more interesting than most of the ""punk"" bands these days. They are agressive in their sound with great guitar hooks and fast solo's. I would compare this to their last EP that was released (which left me wanting more, EP's always seem to do that). If you liked Suburban Teenage Wasteland, or Twisted By Design (which I rank as their best release) you will not be disappointed with American Paradox."
2,Way over rated here,"This is the album that should not have been. The last EP was supposed to have more songs on it and actually be a full length album, but it was bootlegged so they decided to release it as a EP instead. American Paradox sounds like the left overs from the The Elements of Sonic Defiance sessions. They needed to put something out so they rushed this. If you see them live, they only play one or two songs from this album. Buy Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues or Twisted by Design instead."
4,A must have for sony ericsson smartphones,"I purchased this item to serve as a portable speaker system for my macbook pro laptop and my Sony Ericsson P990i smartphone. I wanted to play my playlists and fm radio on my phone in the house. I LOVE THIS THING. The sound is rich and will nicely fill a 200-300 square foot room. The remote is only useful for sound settings. The only thing I wish it could do was allow me to remotely change tracks, playlists, and radio stations. otherwise, I'm happy. It's the closest thing I have to an ipod/iphone stereo docking station. If you want to get more use out of your smartphone without buying MORE gadgets, definitely think about this item."
5,Great,Works well with cupcakes or cakes. I made cupcakes for a friend's child at school and everyone loved the designs.
3,A good introduction to the espionage heroes,"Ernest Volman has the talent to tell his stories in a wonderful way, like watching a thriller on TV. The case he presents are very interesting and cover a wide range of countries and eras, so it is a very good introduction to the international spy game for a beginner. I must say that I had only minimum knowledge about the stories presented here, but when I was able to compare data from the ""Sorge"" chapter of this book against Whymant's masterful book ""Stalin's Spy"", I was somewhat disappointed by the numerous mistakes and the plethora of annoyning errors that Volkman's work includes. Still, it is a very readable and enthralling look to the world of espionage."
5,Wonderful book; a keeper,"This is a truly amazing book. This is the second David Deida book I have read. Six months ago I started my first year of law school, in a new city where I knew nobody. I was really lost for a long time and hit a new low. I eventually took the initiative to do several things to improve my situation, and this book was one of them. It has really helped to change my life by realizing just how closed off I was/am to the world. Change is a slow process, of course, but this book really helped and continues to help. The advice is solid, true, and open. There are no false pretenses in this book; no ego; just insight and something that offers to help.Also, Deida's writing style is very beautiful and sincere, which makes the book that much more helpful."
5,Quik Time,"The book was in fantastic shape, no tears or cuts. It arrived quickly and expeditiously. If possible, I would order from them again and I highly recommend them.Samuel Crow"
1,Great title for Florida this time,"Yes, if only Kerry can win Florida by an unstealable margin, then the Republicans won't be able to do what they did in 2000.Hewitt is a biased moron. Redefeat Bush in 2004!"
2,OK,JUST AN EASY LISTEN. THIS IS FOR A CERTAIN TIME TO JUST RELAX. IT'S FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING.
4,A Woman's Journey,"This book is a journey for one woman who seems solidly real while surrounded by outlandish characters. There is something to gain in realizing that part of yourself is found in the title character, and something to learn when she takes her own route forward into the world. The book is outdated, but is still modern in its approach to women's place in society. I highly suggest the reading and research of this understated story. The play is also a worthwhile reading, and piques more interest as it adds a revised ending that was more pleasing to the crowd of the 1920's. It is an added interest that Zona Gale (the author of the book as well as the screenplay) is the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for ""Miss Lulu Bett."" Overall, Zona Gale is an amazing author, as everything she writes, every little word and sentence, was certainly well thought out and was meant to matter. The book is a trip to the past as well as a peek into a woman's part in life."
3,classic Raquel,the one that got Raquel noticed!well worth a watch..great film NOT because of CGI etc...great ideas made into a great story....classic
1,A B-movie that defines the B-movie world,"Please, please, please reconsider purchacing this movie new unless you absloutly must have it in your collection. This thing is absloutly horrid and the only two redeeming things are the Harryhausen animations and Ms. Welch in that furry bikini of hers. Personally I find it amazing that cavewomen could keep their hair so clean and styled here but that's just me. Now as to the best time to view it? Best when under the influence of a pint of fine whiskey and in the company of good friends that want something to make fun of for a short period of time."
2,Insomniacs delight,"No script. Grunts and screeches replace the English language in this film.The best 2 parts belong to Raquel, and you don't see much of them.Boy gets away from his tribe of angry boys and gets taken in by a tribe of nice people. Earthquake pushes them together. Fighting, grunting and lots of breast heaving makes for a happy ending.If you can get your mind around a fur bikini (al a Ms Welsh and her chums)and still think that this movie has anything serious to say, then this is for you.For the brain dead only."
4,One Million Years B.C.,"It was good movie, but not for kids because this movie has some quite pervert as their female appearance for too sexy."
4,An Examination of Desire,"""Shall We Kiss?"" is a curiosity, and a very watchable one. It seems like a chatty, elegant French romantic comedy-Eric Rohmer Lite, perhaps, or sexier Woody Allen-until it takes an apparant turn for the melodramatic. Behind the melodrama, though, is a further layer of subversive parody, and behind that is a real knowledge of the power of desire. Yet the whole thing's weightless: An upscale date-movie bonbon that keeps yielding pungent aftertastes."
4,DVD WARNING,"I concur with others about the quality of the film. Serious, insightful, wonderfully acted, one of the best screenplays to ever come out of Hollywood. However, the DVD is abysmal. The video is grainy and indistinguishable from average VHS quality. The worst, however, is the ""Widescreen"" presentation. To achieve the effect, Warners video actually cuts off some of the upper and lower part of the screen. This, of course, defeats the whole purpose of widescreen. This is not the first DVD I've seen this on, and it's a disgrace: consumer fraud of the highest degree."
5,A plausible depiction of the behind-the-scenes world of TV,"A well-made film about what executives at the television networks can and could do just to draw bigger audiences and better ratings. This is one film that not only entertains, but also informs us about life in an extremely competitive environment such as the television industry. Excellent performances are rendered by the entire cast of this film although Robert Duvall is a little underutilized. What ever happened to Beatrice Straight?"
5,Can't believe it took this long to see it!,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Very relevant today, as it has been since it was made. Great acting, great story, interesting message. A classic."
5,Great movie,This was a great movie. Very intense and filled with drama right from the beginning. I had seen excerpts of it in other movies prompting me to check it out. Wow it should have won more awards. Being from 1976 it is still pertinent today. Big business TV is probably worse today. I made other people in my family watch it just for the feedback and conversation.
5,A fully politically incorrect comment,"'Network' is unquestionably one major cinematographic achievement of the 70's, but it is also well known among die-hard movie buffs as one of the very few movies allowing for a nice glimpse of Ms Dunaway's anatomy (in the bed scene with William Holden). Now, although this new release is technically much better than Warner's previous release, it is widescreen only whereas the older version offered both widescreen and pan & scan versions - and the P & S version, although heavily cropped on the sides, was slightly less matted on top and bottom, thus offering a better view of the above mentioned treat.So, gentlemen, although this new release is definitely worth buying, maybe the old one is worth keeping on your shelf as well..."
4,Terrific!,"Should be required viewing. I consider it fiction based on fact, not to mention great acting all the way around."
1,The Decline of Western Illustration,"These other reviews are enough to make somebodyt gag... obviously written by one of Tom Tomorrow's cronies, or maybe even Ted Rall.This exactly the kind of book we need LESS of. Further proof that Clip Art and holier-than-thou witicism don't make up for actual talent and craft!Buy this book if you are a high school english teacher in middle America and want some ""poignant"" ""fresh"" political humor... otherwise stay away!"
3,Good Deal,"This book shows the necessary progressions Tom Tomorrow made to become one of one of the best cartoonists out there. Where this book fails to me is the lack of interest I have in some of the older topics that may have been cutting edge at the time, but come off like old political satire on Saturday Night Live where the jokes have exceeded their expiration date. For instance a lot of the Clinton comics just felt like a bad trip down memory lane. I am a bit wrong though as some of the strips from the older Bush presidency have a lot of distinct parallels to the current Bush presidency. All in all this book does give great insight into the long career of Tom Tomorrow. One of my favorite parts was the picture of Tom Tomorrow with Bill O'reilly and the two comics from the Philadelphia Republican convention and the Democratic convention."
1,Very low quality steel and rusts,"Ordered this as a christmas gift to a friend. The shaker is too big for normal drinks, steel very flimsy and it rusted. Seal wasn't great either. He asked for receipt and returned it immediately. Don't bother buying this."
2,Fix Your Own Problems,"This shaker works great as long as you typically mix drinks into either giant glasses (1 gal. +) or you have a really big funnel lying around that you could pour through. If you like to use normal size bar glasses, then you are probably going to make a mess when you spill everywhere. Also, I'd recommend a pair of leather gloves to avoid slicing your hand open when using the shaker. I don't like to wear gloves, so I just drilled a hole in the side and pour ingredients through that. Then, when I am ready to mix I just hold my thumb over the hole. That's a pretty good alternative.The best alternative would be buying a different shaker."
4,husband's toy,"Simple, easy to use drink shaker. We've been looking for one for a while now. This one works out just fine."
1,Not Effective Shaker,"I bought this cocktail shaker in preparation for one of my friend birthday parties. I used it as instructed (placed fluids inside and shook). However, every time I tried to vigorously shake it, liquid would leak out of the poorly fitted lid to base. This made a huge mess! I was thoroughly disappointed. DO NOT buy this product unless you want a mess!!!"
2,Can't finish the book,"I'm sorry, but this book is incredibly dry. I can't seem to finish it no matter how hard I try. Don't buy it if you have short attention span."
1,For readers who like book reports.,"What a disappointment on so many levels. The author appears to prefer long involved sentences and paragraphs. She promotes flowery description a la Jane Austen although such description, to a modern reader, is extraneous filler. But the most egregious failure of this book is that it is filled with quotes and descriptions of novels. If you are looking for an extended series of book reports this is the one for you. It was not the one for me."
1,Writing teacher should not make errors in writing,"Since Ms. Prose is a teacher of writing, and this book purports to be a tool to improve others' writing, it's inexcusable for it to contain errors in punctuation, usage and translation; in addition, some of her examples of to-be-emulated writing are overly subjective and overly long. I noted 92 outright errors and questionable examples and might have found more if I hadn't got so bored that I skipped 20+ pages.As a memoir, this book is reasonably enjoyable. It's not an informative writing guide."

2,POOR QUALITY,"I just played this dvd and its not very good quality at all. It comes in like a old vhs tape. i have a samsung 55"" l.e.d. tv and it still isnt very good. bad thing is i actually paid 20 dollars for this movie. I realize it was made in 1993 but shouldnt they have cleaned it up for DVD? I'm very unsatisfied with my purchase. I doubt i can return it because it's already open..."
1,Mold alert,"This was the second gourd I had acquired after successfully curing and enjoying my first one for a while. This gourd is very attractive and the mate that comes with it is tasty. However, after following the directions for curing, several patches of green mold appeared. I tried to kill these with boiling water as recommended in some mate-related websites, but a weak spot in the bottom of the gourd was apparently cracked by the heat and a leak developed. Amazon gives no refunds on these types of items so as another reviewer mentioned, you're rolling the dice. On a related note, contrary to what some mate enthusiasts on the Internet may say, it is NOT safe to drink from a moldy gourd. Green mold appearing in your gourd will likely be penicillium, which has the ability to produce mycotoxins."
1,This should be Freeware!,"This software has a few nice features and does some of these nicely. However, the rest of it performs like a DOG (and I am using a very high-end computer loaded with lots of memory and super-fast). But if you're lucky you will even get a crashing error message when you go to Exit. However, DON'T dare try to UNinstall it! It will trash your Windows operating system (I am using Windows 2000 with latest service packs) and take system files along with it!! I had this problem on 2 different computers and ended up having to totally reinstall Windows! It was a nightmare. If I did not own Pinnacle Studio 8, I wouldn't take it if it were given to me FREE. Beware!"
2,Try something else first,"While this product is functional and relatively easy to use, it seems to struggle to keep even the smallest projects together. My latest project, a 20 minute production with mostly still images and MP3 music, continued to crash until I removed all of the music and readded it. The product has a self update feature that prompts you when there are fixes available. While this is a very nice feature, I have patched it at least three times and the product still seems to have many bugs. If you have endless patience and enjoy battling frustrating software this is the product for you. Two stars is probably generous."
1,DVD Authoring Limitations,"I researched several DVD authoring packages to find one that lived up the claim to create DVDs ""like Hollywood"" productions. I spent the money for Video 8, and if you need all the video capture and editing tools, this may work using the Hollywood FX features. However, I had already edited my video using Vegas Video (a 5 star video editing package), so Video 8 did not offer any value to me for video editing. What had caught my attention were the motion buttons and menu backgrounds. Those work but the customer support could not tell me how to create menus that skipped other menus or assign specific chapters to menu buttons. Above all, on WinXP, Video 8 crashed and sent error reports about 15 times in a two-week period. This forced me to research further and I found Ulead DVD Workshop (ASIN=B00006412S) to be superior. Of course, it is about $... more than Video 8 but it appears to be worth it to have the ""Hollywood"" navigation features available for DVD."
1,Bug infested software!,"Let me just say that I can't even TRY to burn a DVD because I can't get past the editing phase. Everytime I try to insert a transition the whole program goes haywire, and it's an ongoing battle to even get Window's to shut the beast down! And I have a top of the line Gateway 700 series computer with a decent 512 MB of ram. I have oodles of hard drive. This software came with the computer but it isn't even close to compatable. I feel much better having read through all the reviews. At least I know it's not user error. It's just a downright unstable program!IF it worked it would be a fun and easy way to edit home videos. However, it does NOT work. Now I have to try to find some other program to burn the three hours of home video I have accumulated.Back to the drawing board!"
1,Bugs...,"I have tried many versions of Studio over the last three+ years. They all have serious bugs such as crashing and hanging which make them useless. I tried Studio 8, installed the upgrade to 8.3 and hand many problems. I am using a standard P4 system with XP SP1. Iy you do try Studio then make a project from start to finish with minimal editing so you don't wast a lot of time editing to only find out you cannot rednder, burn, save, etc."
4,Good end-to-end movie making package,"Studio 8 takes an already strong video editing package and makes it even stronger by adding new features that allow the user to burn their movies to DVD. I've enjoyed using Studio 7 to turn my own camcorder footage into movies that I can share with family and friends for some time now, and being able to create the DVDs from within the new Studio 8 is a major improvement."
1,simply does not work - do not buy this,"I have a pumped, brand new box with a fast chip and a ton of memory and this software consistently locks up on me. I cannot get it to render a movie.Importing and editing the video was fine an dthe UI is OK. I was able to import images once, and now the software gives me an error every time I try to open an image.I cannot even navigate to the ""Make Movie"" UI without my PC locking up.Tech support has been zero help."
2,Oh I wish I would have read these reviews first!,"I bought my full version of Studio 8 today after playing with and enjoying the downloadable trial. Unfortunately, it won't even install (on a 24 hour old P4 2.6 ghz HP computer with XP). Apparently Pinnacle produced God knows how many install CDs with bad serial numbers. So now I get to wait to have Staples overnight me a new CD ... who knows if that will have the same problem or not. The good thing is that I didn't buy direct through Pinnacle after seeing how bad their support is.That said, I thorougly enjoyed the Trial Version and thought they had a great program until I experienced difficulties right out of the box."
3,So far so good,"As War02Orc said, a higher end computer would work better for the Pinnacle Studio 8. The more RAM your computer has the better. The more hard drive space the better. The more speed the better. Currently I work with a computer that has 1.8 gigahertz speed, 1 gigabite of RAM, 100 gigabites of hard drive space,and I use an external hard drive with 120 gigabites of space. And both hard drives are formatted to NTFS instead of FAT32.( Note:You can capture more video with NTFS than with FAT32.)I also make sure that I defragment my hard drives frequently, and when I log on to my computer, I look at my tool bar and check for other programs that are running and exit out of them before editing. From time to time Studio has its quirks, but I have not had any problems with it so far."
1,Where's the German quality?,"Total garbage. Won't capture more than 55 minutes of video ata shot. Crashes regularly. No Mercedes or BMW here. The Germans should be embarrassed. Get the Taiwanese stuff: ULead DVD MovieFactory. Cheaper, simpler and better"
2,Problems: rendering stops ... hard to find a solution,"A very common problem with this software. The program stops at certain point and that's it. I read in the web that too many people are having similar problems. There should be a patch available by now but none. Not even instructions how to correct the problem. It is fine to create a movie, add titles, sounds, transitions, etc but when you want to create you own dvd or mpeg file not so easy. I wasted hours and why not days trying to find a solution to my problem and still nothing. I am thinking is finding a better software that does the job. Good luck if you buy this software. I recommend to download a free trial copy, if possible, first before you buy it and test it very well. Create a movie and make as complex as your normal work will be and see if it works for you."
1,LIke the other reviewers have said...,...avoid this software. Spent hours rendering a 15 minute VCD using a P4 1.8 Mhz Dell. My computer is up to date and not a slow machine. I made a bunch of coasters as a final product. I have returned this for my money back. Look elsewhere!!!
1,Read the pinnaclesys.com forums first,"The Studio 8 upgrade will trash your computer if you are using Adaptec EZ CD (aka Roxio). By the way, their MicroMV support doesn't work yet despite what the marketing literature says (see their faq). If you don't believe me, spend some time on the pinnaclesys.com support discussion forums. Plenty of users, including myself, are having their computers trashed by the Studio 8 upgrade. The CD ROM drives disappear after the upgrade reboot, and to get them back you have to uninstall Adaptec (Roxio) and fudge the registry by hand. Again, don't take my word for it, go read the discussion forums on Pinnacle's web site."
1,Hopelessly unreliable,"I have never encountered such an unstable program of any kind before. The crashes are not even consistent in terms of what causes them. Performing the exact same steps over and over again results in different program responses from lost scenes, to total hang ups, to almost working OK etc. The features and price would be great if this program worked.For a major software house and a big player in the video editing field, Pinnacle should be ashamed of the implimentation if this program. If they had any decent corporate morals or ethics, they would pull this program off the shelves until it worked and offer its current users a free upgrade to the working version.Until there is a working version of this program, DON'T BUT IT!"
1,Pinnacle Studio 8 is a Disaster!,"If you bought this for someone as a Christmas gift, return it! I'd rather be given a lump of coal! They will hate it and you associate this unusable garbage with you every time they try to use it. It's been almost 6 months since I first encountered the audio out-of-sync problem when I bought it, and the problem is still not resolved. It has affected roughly 90% of its customers. Yet Pinnacle has no problem continuing to sell its Studio 8 line. It is rather disgusting that this company has no conscience in marketing their defective software just to make Wall Street's profit estimates and enrich themselves with stock options. Go to their forums at pinnaclesys.com and read what others say about this product before wasting your money AND LOTS OF TIME struggling with this defective product."
1,...,"Underneath all this fancy packaging, is a satanic soul reaver that will suck the very essence of time itself right out from under you.example - I spent 7 HOURS capturing and editing a FOUR MINUTE video, and just as I was about to save it to my computer, Studio 8.5 decided it had to shut down, and it deleted all of my work without saving jack. The few times I did actualy get a couple of things burned onto DVD, the picture was pixalated that it looked like I downloaded them off the...net. Anyone who gives this ...a good review is either working for Pinnacle, or they are working for the Devil (maybe both).I do not jest."
1,Waste of money,"Here is a summary: Studio 8 lacks a full comlememnt of file conversion tools; It just says ""cant access file"" and drops it. I have to convert video clips with VideoWave 3 just to get the Studio 8 to accept them. The scene detector tool is maddeningly slow. Luckily I figured out how to shut it off. I cant write a video CD because Pinnacle 8 locks up during the ""rendering"" process and it nearly impossible to shut down. Since I bought this for making CDs it is useless to me. If you want to make a cd for viewing on your TV set forget it. The manual is really bad, not much help for incessant bugs and breakdowns. You can't easily delete files from the album and when the software opens the next time you use it there are all sorts of surprises that appear for everyone to see. I am sorry I bought this software. Don't waste your money."
3,Not all that bad,"I think it's a pretty fair program, but then my needs aren't too great -- just stringing together a few clips along with transitions and titles. If I was going to do serious editing, I certainly wouldn't buy an inexpensive program like this to do it. It does crash fairly often but I just work around that by saving frequently, something that should be done anyway. I've found it easy to use and have been pleased with my results. I think it's really a quite capable program for the price."
3,US version won't do PAL video,"Beware anyone whose video camera records in PAL format. The version of Studio 8 sold in the U.S. does not support PAL. You won't see anything about this in the product literature. Only after trying to capture PAL video will you search the knowledge base and find out. The KB contains an item asking where you can buy the PAL version, and it doesn't even answer the question!We bought Studio 8, and then took a vacation. Our au pair, who is from France and who has a recent Sony DV camera purchase in Europe, taped the whole vacation. When we got back, we tried to capture the video. No luck. Now we're searching for the European version, which apparently handles both formats."
1,IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I bought it bundled with a DVD burner and I'm going to return the whole thing all together, because it will cost more to just buy another stand alone program if you add the price of the burner to it. It has nice features but THEY DON'T WORK!!!! I already wasted 3 DVD-R's. Too bad I'm not allowed to shovel it back into the ""mouths"" of the people that wrote this software."
2,Very disappointing,"I've had many problems with S8. Although I like the overall structure and advertised functionality of the program, the many bugs make this a very frustrating program to use. I use the program for editing my captures, creating DVD menus, and convert to MPEG. The actual capture and burn to DVD are done with other programs I have. Editing is the worst. S8 loses track of where it is. Scenes are marked on the timeline by still-scene clips. Often, the still-scene off by a few frames, sometimes it's off my minutes. This makes it almost impossible to know where you are in the edited movie. Before you buy, check out the many problems on Pinnacle's user forums. These are real problems although it appears a few systems are immune to them. So the question is ... do you feel lucky? Unfortunately, I haven't found a reliable alternative in the same price range."
1,greatest waste of time in the history of software!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this software. Seriously, if you spend the time you spend working with this software at a part time, minimum wage job to buy a better video editing package, you would be happier. I have worked with literally thousands of software packages in my 15 year career as systems\network Administrator, and this is the most pathetic software I have ever used. There is not one facet of the package that works right. You will spend hours, days, weeks creating a video only to find it has disapeared or become corrupted."
1,Problems with Studio 8,"Except for a very long rendering time, Studio 8 ran fine until I upgraded from 8.10 to 8.12. When I clicked on the ""Make Movie"" tab the computer consistently crashed with a Windows Protection Error or just hung up the computer necessitating a cold boot.The Pinnacle Tech support came up with all sorts of fixes which none worked.The program obviously was released and not tested prior to release.It is junk and I would not recommend it to anyone.I am using Windows ME but others using XP are having similar problems."
4,good stuff!,"Really helps with my digestive problems, it seems to work best when I take it approx. 15 minutes before eating. However it can also be helpful when taken after eating."
5,work for my facial rashes,"I started to have facial rashes and acne 2 years ago, which I never had in my life. After researching and googling, I tried the enzymes I bought from local stores. My facial problem started to improve drastically after one week. Eventually, the rashes and acne were cured. The price from Amazon is excellent."
3,Not effective for me,"I bought these to replace another product and did not find that these helped much. They did work, but I found that my other product was far more effective."
5,kids love watching,"My kids (6,5 and 2) love watching this and, since it's a PBS kids program, I don't mind letting them. I love that it streams free with my Prime membership."
2,very light duty coin sorter,"This sorter is very light duty. It jams frequently and unless the coin tubes are perfectly round, the coins do not enter them squarely. I can not recommend this coin sorter. I am looking for a better quality sorter...."
2,Bad buy,I would say this is a bad buy because it broke right away.I would not recommend you get this!
2,Save your money,"Bought this sorter about 10 months ago and have struggled with it since.It usually missorts coins (7 of 10 tubes I took to the bank were miscounted or missorted) so plan on recounting coins prior to heading to the bank.Other defects...Constant Jamming, Very weak motor and cheap plastic construction.The motor just died on mine and its heading for the trash after less than a year. I could've saved the money and got the same amount of frustration for free from the wife."
3,Great Show - Mediocre Quality,"As much as I love this anime and have wanted to order for quite some time, I was disappointed with the product itself when I got it in the mail. Disc 4 and half of an episode on disc 7 do not work, no matter what I use to play them with. While it says it is in great condition, it's evident either the item was tampered with or was damaged during shipment. Hopefully, getting the items resurfaced will make them work, though hopefully I won't be getting such mediocre merchandise next time I decide to place an order."
1,Is the author BRAINWASHED?,"Unfortunately, the option of zero stars was not available for this book. This is conservative reactivism at its worst. The author obviously misunderstood the purpose of a university education. The point of higher education is to open your eyes, not to further close them to the possibility of new ideas. Coming from the MECCA of campus ""liberalism,"" Berkeley, the leftist exterior is a faccade for latent conservatism."
1,irresponsible.,"I used to read Shapiro's columns in the Daily Bruin, and this book follows the same pattern-- sneering, arrogant writing that doesn't really bother with ""facts."" It's all very well that he's got lots of footnotes-- if only they were accurate! He's obviously smart enough to know the difference between reporting facts and quotes and distorting/falsifying them-- and perhaps if his argument were stronger, he wouldn't have to resort to such exaggeration and distortion."
1,Our universities are failing. . .,"to reach people like Mr. Shapiro. From his on-line column of July, 2002 Mr. Shaprio says:""I am getting really sick of people who whine about ""civilian casualties."" Maybe I'm a hard-hearted guy, but when I see in the newspapers that civilians in Afghanistan or the West Bank were killed by American or Israeli troops, I don't really care. In fact, I would rather that the good guys use the Air Force to kill the bad guys, even if that means some civilians get killed along the way. One American soldier is worth far more than an Afghan civilian."" (...)No wonder smart, educated professors offend Mr. Shaprio. Too bad the university failed to teach him critical thinking. His brain could have used a little washing."
1,Just Awful,"I read the first part of this book while spending time in the library last week. The kid is just awful. I doubt he believes his own writing, but rather is just taking advantage of the extreme-right for financial gain. Deplorable."
3,Not dishwasher safe!,"Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid Professional HD Series 5 Quart Bowl Lift Stand Mixer, SilverThere was a significant blemish on the side but it is reconditioned, otherwise it has worked well so far. My only real complaint to date is that I put the blender attatchment in the dishwasher and it ruined it. I didn't realize that it had some sort of coating on it which came off when it was in the dishwasher. I'm irriated because it said that it was dishwasher safe but it definitely isn't."
1,Im not pleased,"the article said i was supposed to recibe this: Extremely limited four disc (threeCDs + PAL/Region 0 DVD) Gift Set edition of the 2007 compilation features a bonus DVD, a bonus Karaoke CD, a bonus remix CD, postcards, a friendship bracelet and more. The 15 track album features two new songs ('Voodoo' and 'Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)') while the DVD contains 12 of their music videos. The karaoke CD includes 13 sing-a-long tracks and the remix disc closes out the set with 11 remixed classics. EMI.that's the exact text from ediros review and also product description, and I ONLY GOT A CD CASE WITH 2 DISCS, GREATEST HITS AND VIDEO COMPILALATION. no karaoke and no remix. i wish i could get what i order"
1,Headlines (Friendship Never Ends) video???,"does not have the video Headlines (Friendship Never Ends), the cover of the cd says it has more on the dvd it does not appear. I felt cheated."
5,Come on...you know you want it,"If you were older than 5 in 1994, then you remember this quintet of Brits bursting onto the scene. No, I'm not referring to the Beatles--it's the Spice Girls! Ginger, Sporty, Baby, Posh and Scary (otherwise known as Geri, Mel C, Emma, Victoria and Mel B) took the world by storm (even outselling that other famous Brit quintet I mentioned earlier), and introduced the world to Girl Power. Even though their career went by the wayside far earlier than it should have, their multitude of hits are still great today (and they're even making a small comeback). This collection not only includes pretty much every big song they ever put out, it also includes a 2nd disc with the videos of all but 2 of the songs on the CD! If you ever liked them--even if it was only in the privacy of your bedroom--buy this. You won't be disappointed."
1,If you really have nothing to do. . . .,"This has to be one of the worst movie I ever forced my way through - it fact - I could only watch about half of the movie. The actors and actresses (I use the terms quite loosely) plus the ""background sets"" - are all fourth rate material.Don't bother buying this DVD. If you really want to watch it - please just rent it. Then if you want to buy it - be my guest, you are truly a better person than me."
1,Please....,"Special Edition? How about Special Ed?I watched ""Science Fiction,Fantasy Reality"" on the ""Global Warming Edition/Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"".These idiots were trying to say that Global warming was not invented by Irwin Allen.They actually claimed that Jules Verne predicted the size of the Apollo spacecraft.He didn't,he just set up some chairs in his parlor,added a walkway and gave it the shape of a bullet,duh.[20 bucks says that Verne had a chair,if you multiply it's width by 5(passengers+ walkway on either side) and add the hull thickness of the USS Maine..you have his ""prediction"" of the Apollo spacecraft's size,minus the Saturn V booster,of course.Those science fiction writers aqre so stupid,The Nautilus was just given a magical way of propelling a surface warship sized sub,look at when it was written!!!]Now these idiots have to update the whole Irwin Allen catalog so nobody suspects what they are up to.Thanx,You know who"
4,it goes back along way,The copy is very good but it would've been better if they had add ons and special feature of the editing and actors.
3,Good old movies,This is the original lost world movie much better than all the remakes. This has good acting and good special effects for the time.
2,Now that's what I call quite....dull !,"Aside from the super fun and musically spriteful 'Happy Hour' or the two sweet recalls of classics 'Caravan Of Love' and 'He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother', which were so well covered a la accapella by these Brit boys (super job), the rest of the 'best' of them were not really bad. They were dull. The writing and instrument 'choices' were good, just the construction of the songs give a mood of an overlong grey, rainy day.Gimme Happy Hour again !"
5,so much fun,"had a great time with our kids ages 5 thru 13. easy rehearsals, used low key set/props and traditional costumes we already had, great music selections - we used a combination of cd and piano. the audience/parents loved it! the kids really enjoyed performing. so much fun!"
1,What the....,"Deep and emotionally moving? Please. A pop star that should have ended his career when Nirvana took over the charts. This music is as shallow as it gets. I understand that he is not angry or loud, which is something I would say everyone respects to a certain degree. But there is good soft music that makes you think and has concept behind it, real ideas. Micheal has done nothing good for music except clear paths for solo artists like himself who have nothing to offer but a voice, and sometimes looks."
4,It Takes Time.,"When I first got this cd, I was thinking in my head oh what happened to Michael Bolton. But after listening to it for the second time, I just love the songs. There is variety and still he manages to add his own trademarks. He manages to remain romantic with a twist of modern pop and latin beats to add a bit of freshness to his usual style. For anyone who is an old lover of Michael Bolton just give this cd sometime, and I am sure it will grow on you. As for others who seem to insult him, why don't you give him a try before you insult it. It Takes Time."
4,Surprise villain,"Christie doing what she does best. I never would have guessed the villain, though she uses a few unorthodox tricks. Perhaps a bit convoluted, but a good read."
3,"Good, but complicated","The story first started off alright- all the characters were introuduced, and everything sounded interesting.however, the story goes on and on and it became a bit complicated. without paying close attention, one could be easily wandered off somewhere and got lost in the plot.but it isnt a bad one. recommanded to skillful readers / experienced Christie's readers."
3,"A good book, but not as good as most of her work.","A reasonably interesting mystery. In classic fashion it turns a simple ""suicide"" into a case which could implicate and one of a number of suspects. However, it is less straightforward and easy to follow than most of Agatha Christie's novels with the role of various characters not fully explained."
5,An american with aussie tastes,"After spending six months down under I grew to love both Killing Heidi and another aussie band Spiderbait. I own all of the singles that came out while I was there and I also bought the album. If you get a chance to buy the singles, they are great. ( i love the acoustic version of Mascara) And check out Spiderbait---""Glockenpop"" is a varied and great album."
2,My girls had no interest in this toy,I thouhgt the toy seemed like a good idea once my twins were around the crawling stange. They have never played with this toy. In fact the only part they like is the little plastic balls that you put down the middle. They will hold and chase the balls around the house but they never actually connected the balls with the tube part. I wish I had saved some money and just bought the balls instead.
1,This Drum's a Flop,"I am a first-time mom of a 17 month-old toddler boy. I, like many of you, am constantly in search of reasonably priced, quality toys. This is not it. I bought this before my son was crawling because the box had said that is will promote crawling.Well, my son thought nothing of it from the start and still has no interest in it.My son is very active and loves to explore. After the drum rolled away, he didn't find it engaging enough to follow after it. Also, his hand got stuck when he tried to retrieve the ball by holding onto it. The only good thing is that now he uses the balls to throw around. This toy is one to skip."
2,Waste of money,"I was very excited to purchase this for my son but he had no interest in it. He did enjoy playing with the balls but never actually put them inside and never crawled to get to the toy. All in all, I feel it was a waste of money."
2,Save U Money,the only thing that i've found good about this toy is that the balls can be used in other fisher price toys.
3,My daughter is indifferent and so am I...,"I suppose that this toy is okay, but its a pain ...when the balls are always coming out of it because my daughter really enjoys them rolling around in the thing and when they come out she loses interest immediately. She'll put them back in it on occasion, but she wants the lights and sounds from it to work together and it's just not working out for her."
2,Wouldn't bother to buy again,"I thought this toy would be fun for my daughter as well as encourage her to crawl. Basically, she likes the balls. I bought it when she was about 6 months old and she has spent maybe 20 minutes total playing with it in 4 months. If it rolls away, she loses interest and she doesn't have much in it to start with. Don't bother with this toy."
4,Two toys in one,"My 8 month old son loves this toy. Not only does he enjoy the sounds and light rewards when he puts the balls away in the canister, but the balls themselves have become a toy of their own. They're just small and lightweight enough for him to pick up on his own and carry around the house."
3,Not as pictured,"I expected these to just have the Ram's head old Dodge logo as pictured, however they also say ""RAM"" on them. I got them for my Dodge, not a RAM, please update your photo. Will not be going through the hassle of returning but did not receive what I was expecting."
4,In The Ashes series,I have been ordering these books for my husband. He loves this series and goes thru a book as fast as I eat chocolate. I am having trouble getting the rest of the series. He is about half way thru it and I either can't find the next book or I can't afford it.
3,this heli is a lot a fun,this is a really fun toy to play with but the bad thing is that its very cheap quality. the first day i bought this toy it broke. but then i exchanged and i got a good one that works
2,A Pirate How too...,"""The Pirate Life"" is written in bespectacled Pirate speak that pours what they call Pir-attitude ""Arrr Matey. What's that your carryin' 'neath yur nickers?"" to and fro in order to make whimsical patter and frolic fun. or ""Whose that winch you takin' out tonite capn' Blood, me havn't seen her round the aft bunkhouse afore.""Pir-attitude is something necessary to become a pirate, especially on talk like a pirate day... but it's all in fun... I recommend this read to anyone who wants a lackadaisical laugh at a pirates whim..."
5,A fun book,"This was bought by my fiancee. I have little to do with the planning of the wedding so I haven't seen the book, but she seems to like. She says it is fun."
5,Perfect gift,"This book is a perfect gift for a flower girl. Should give it to her a few months or weeks before the wedding, as it explains what her job is. You can fill in the names of people in your bridal party, that way she knows before the big day."
3,Slightly transparent pulpy fun mystery,"It ain't Agatha, kids. Get over it. This is an adventure for armchair adventurers and isn't supposed to really make sense or be realistic. Once you get over that, it's an amusing cartoon -- one reviewer here compared Amelia Peabody to Mary Poppins, and that's not far from accurate -- that transports you to far-off Egypt and invests your emotions in a soap opera while something mildly suspenseful goes on. Characters have the depth of popsickle sticks, there's plenty of humor, and a few cool relevations about Egypt. Would I read another? Depends on what my other options are, but I don't have a negative memory of this book, even though it took some concerted effort to get past the very Britishy (formal, logical, heroic, ineffectual, neurotic) beginning."
2,Fair Book from Drake,"I am a big fan of the Hammer's Slammers series and have enjoyed some of Mr. Drake's other books, but this was not his best effort. The premise was good but the book never grabbed me. It was a Fair book at best."
2,"cute, immature and a little boring","IN ""The Gift"" I found the premise of psychic abilities and the lack of acceptance of the community, interesting...but the story and the characters never fully develped beyond a two-dimensional realm. I found it immature and unrealistic to say the least. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this one."
3,You must pay attention to the writing and not photo!,Photo! Is misleading. Make sure when getting cheap Famicom system / Us Nintendo system (clone). You read that it states US only!!!! Even though photo shows it coming with converter cartridge never got one with my system. If your looking for cheap Famicom / us Nintendo top loading with converter. go for product called super fc loader or super 8. or just make your own converter using r.o.b. us cartridge or excite bike us cartridge. other that i love the system it's cheap top loader at only 20 bucks and controllers kick ass but dont work in regular system :(!
5,"Blues Clues, dvd","A recent interest and a definite winner with my toddler. She fell in love with the blue puppy and she (Blue) has a great way of educating and expanding young minds. Music, dance, imagination, drawing, coloring, tracing, exploring, you name it Blue does it in her movies. I ended up purchasing all the dvd's to make certain my daughter doesn't get bored with the same dvds over and over. However she doesn't mind and enjoys her blues clues. Big on imagination? I recommend this toddler Nick Jr character for your kids."
3,"Effective, but ...","I used this to advantage, although getting the password was a hassle, and when changing comnputers getting hooked up again almost impossible. Fairly easy to use, and motivating, although it takes a fair amount of time. Frequent weighings can be discouraging. Mostly I was disappointed in paying for something I then couldn't access."
2,Just another diet program with problems,I've had this software for about a year now and I just upgraded to vs.9 and the usual problem getting the software registered occurred. I also have been trying to get a question answered without any success. They just ignore me. This last time they cut one part of my email out and responded to it and ignored the question I had. Pretty arrogant. My wife uses Lance Armstrong's software on the cloud and it works better and is free. I regret I ever bought it and will not be spending anymore money on upgrades.
1,NutriBase7,"I have not been able to register it. The second time I tried to opened it and use it it wanted me to register and I have tried 3 times, if I donot get it register this week I am returning it.thank you, Lynn"
3,"sad, somewhat enlightening book","Ordinary people tells the story of what happens after a son in a family dies in a boating accident. The second son attempts suicide but fails and the father and mother and son try to cope with their life. It is sad throughout and ends on an indecisive note. The best part is the relationship between the son and his counselor who helps the boy to see that what happened was not his fault and that he can get on with his life.The biggest problem I had with the characters is the mother who is presented as unable to relate to her remaining son and constantly arguing with the father. In the end she leaves, but in reality she was never there.This book can be a thoughtful way for families to think about their own problems."
4,Psychological Drama,"""Ordinary People"" can best be described as a Psychological Drama because of the complex character development that leads you to analyze the motives and reactions of Conrad, Calvin, and Beth in the wake of Jordan's death and Conrad's attempted suicide. The characters reactions to grief are vastly different, which gives the novel great dimension and different perspectives.If you are looking for a light read, this is not it. It, at times, can be deeply depressing and heartbreaking. Also, the ending has no real resolution and will leave you wanting more."
5,Best on the 2nd and 3rd read,"I think most people will agree that Ordinary People is a very good book, in its content. Some may think that it was a little confusing or over-dramatic. I can guarantee you that you will change your mind the second time you read the novel. Honestly, this book gets better and better every time you read it. It doesn't hurt to watch the movie a few times either, though i prefer the book over the movie any day. I think one of the best things about the novel is how there's no ONE protagonist or antagonist. You might say the story was all about Conrad. But couldn't it also be about Cal? or about Beth? This novel prevents you from putting labels and tags all over it. It is just too realistic and very emotional and everyone should read it!"
5,Helped shape my early adulthood,"I read this in high school the semester after I read Catcher in the Rye. At the time, I couldn't relate to Salinger's Caufield, but something about Conrad and his family really resonated with me. I still consider this one of the best books Ive read. It is painfully real, and almost impossible, as far as I can see, not to relate with. In the time since I read ""Ordinary People,"" I have come to appreciate Salinger's work at least on the level of this book, though in a different way. Conrad and Holden Caufield are two of the only modern characters who have really affected me. Conrad when I was a bit younger, and Caufield more recently. If you liked ""Catcher,"" you should really give this book a read."
1,Confusing and inaccurate,"In a series of more or less disconnected scenes and vignettes which oscillate randomly between reality and the protagonist's hallucinations, the movie depicts the mental deterioration of a character loosely based on the Viennese Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt. According to director Ruiz, this fictionalized Klimt was ravaged by general paresis, that is, syphilitic dementia. The real Klimt died not from syphilis but of complications of a stroke. Largely unexplored by this film are the Vienna Secession, and the development of Klimt's artistic style. Certainly this is not the first fictionalized biography: in contrast to Shaffer's Amadeus, for example, Salieri was not responsible for Mozart's death, but in his fictionalized version of history, Peter Shaffer far more deftly explores the mystery of genius. Some reviewers have commented that one needs to do research to understand the film. I submit that such a requirement is evidence of the film's failure."
2,Biography about the famous artist,"I must admit that what attracted me to this film is the fact that film is about Klimt -- artist whose work is recognised immediately and the fact that he is portrayed by the actor John Malkovich - great character actor. But I was disapointed by both Malkovich's performance and film direction.Perhaps if I knew about Klimt's life the film would complement that knowledge. As that was not the case, I found film to be too fragmented and confusing. Was Klimt a complicated man, or was he plain crazy? Was he promiscuous, or was it his art that required unlimited supply of women to serve him as models, muses and lovers?No matter what, the remaining stars for the movie are for wonderful costumes, reproductions of some of Klimt's best known work and beautiful actresses on the set."
1,Klimt is a BAD movie,"Stay away. This is one of the worst movies ever made. It is all pretence and superficial doddering about on the set by John Malkovich. No insight. No story. No argument. Not even a painting... Some good looking naked women, though. That is all."
1,the graphs and ables are omitted,"I bought this paper, I want to say, don't do that, the equations in the paper are impossible to read, the graphs and the tables are omitted."
2,Complaint - poor quality,"The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation."
5,"Astonishing, but plausible, explanations of sexual behavior","This book bowled me over. If one believes in evolution, one should be prepared to believe that the body has reasons that the mind can never know, or couldn't until now.The complaint from many reviewers that no research is cited to back up the astonishing claims merely shows their lack of attention to the Introduction, where the research book is named: Human Sperm Competition, by Mark Bellis and R. Robin Baker. Unfortunately, it costs about $85"
4,Moving in a new direction,"I enjoyed this album...but I still find ""Prose Combat"" and ""Paradisiaque"" as the best Solaar albums out there. The beats are really heavy, and I'm curious to know why he's moving in a more ""Gangster Moderne"" direction...away from the more lucid style of ""Qui Seme le Vent""...."
4,Good book,"Very cute book, just keep little fingers away from it or the book is broke. Very colorful and fun. A joy to read and my 10 month old loved it."
2,poor sound,"Huge Eric Clapton fan ,saw him in Melbourne - brilliant, but the sound on this dvd is poor, better off saving your money"
1,Bootleg with poor quality - Amazon shouldn't sell it,"Poor audio quality, no-name publisher, even gaps inside songs when whoever taped this hit the pause button by mistake. Don't buy it."
4,bearing packer,Use this item when replacing or reinstalling wheel bearings. Works fine and helps keep the grease off my hands. Would recommend.
5,Nice Way To Pack Bearings,"This is a great tool for the automotive enthusiast or event the professional. This bearing packer does what it claims, it packs bearings. The materials are all high quality, the ease of use is first rate and the effectiveness of the packer is great. I would highly recommend this product, it's a lot easier than hand packing, and not too much money."
2,I guess every1s wants in on the electronic/techno craze...,"So are these girls the classical version of the britney spears/n'sync poster icons... did some fat guy bring them together, find some producers to write the music, and mass market their pretty faces to the mainstream?The music is only so-so... i do believe that classical instruments can be integrated with modern electronic sounds very beautifully... but these girls (or whoever wrote the music) are trying way too hard. Personally, I'd rather hear something new and innovated than regurgitated classical pieces kludged together with underdeveloped generic techno/breakbeats.and what the hell is up with the track ""Alexander the Great""... Scratches and Hip-hop vocal samples ontop of some classical quartet piece?"
5,The Victory of Victory,Victory is the the best modern violin song I ever heard and all the others are just iceing on the cake!!! :)
5,"Classical Music, built for the Dance Floor!!!!!!","This is it, the CD that started it all, Bond's debut album. What can I say that the other positive reviewers have already said here? The musicianship is top notch, the arrangements are stellar and the beats are mad! Classical fans may want to stay clear, but dance fans (like myself) will eat the girls up :) !The Victory Mix is just killer and is worth the price of the disc alone.I highly recommend this CD along with Bonds new CD ""Classified"" and another great dance CD called ""Techno Obsession"" by mr.deviant. ""Techno Obsession"" is a powerful mix of rock and hard dance music that is just killer and very diverse."
4,Great arrangements,I love this CD. I reminds me of Vanessa-Mae's debut CD. I love how the ladies re-create classical hits into electrifying numbers.Great CD!
5,truly great CD,"every track is worth hearing, you won't be disappointed, every single music is amazing and the group truly did an excellent job, to truly appreciate it you have to experience it firsthand."
3,Guess I'm Not into CrossOver Music,"I was intrigued to get this CD after hearing some of it on beethoven.com and Sir Stewart's recommendation of this.I find myself disappointed with the majority of tracks on this CD, they all leave me back in the disco age with that same monotonous beat. The beginning held great promise for their version of 1812, but then the disco beat boomed out and left me uninspired until their ending, which wasn't bad but not great.Did enjoy both cuts of ""Victory"" as well as ""Horobushko"" ""Duel"" ""Bella Donna""They certainly are attractive young accomplished musicians. I'm not really into this throbbing, pulsating sound though. Little is ok, but can't listen to this for very long."
3,"They look HOT, their music is so so","Hot babes on the cover..... don't judge a CD by its cover. The music is OK, would never have purchased but for the hotties on the cover."
2,"Its ok, but i would like to fine the original vol.'s","i agree with another reviewer at of the vol's are totally wrong for example vol is totally wrong the vol. has songs i've never heard they left out all the best like somebody please . oppertunity , n so on if any one has the orginal copys please email me the list i would really apperciate it"
3,"East Side Story, Vol. 1-12 [BOX SET] [LIMITED EDITION]","I grew up in Cypress Park (The Avenues) area of Los Angeles in the 50s and 60s. I'm a big fan of Doo Wop/Low Rider style music. I was excited about the ""East Side Story Box"" release. There is a lot of rare finds and standards in this box set. I was glad to finally get ""Talk To Me"" by Sunny & The Sunliners.There are more great songs on these discs but some are obviously recorded from vinyl (surface noise, pops and clicks) or there are better recordings in other collections (the Doo Wop Box sets or the Vee-Jay Records Box set, etc.). The collection has a mix of early R&B; and East L.A. favorites. I just wished they`d taken the time to get the best recordings possible."
2,Nice Try,"This is not the original East Side Story Collection.More than 50% of the original songs were deleted.Some volumes barely contain one or two of the original tracks, while others are in fact the real deal and contain all the correct songs in the correct order. I do not wish to sound negative, I'm shure the people who made this compilation tried hard to get all the rights to the music, and for this I aplaude them. Althoe I wonder if maybe they should have waited to get the rights to Thee Midnighters songs, who's Cd was released around the same time.If I was experiencing this for the first time I would have to say this is a great collection and would give it 4 or5 stars. The replacement songs are good enough to warrant there own volumes such as EAST SIDE STORY GOLD Vol,4,5,6, Etc;In my defence I do own all 12 volumes on vinyl including East Side Story Gold Vol.1,2,and 3."
1,Wish there was a zero stars option!,"This video is too bad to even rate a ""campy"" label. The director could have picked 20 people at random off the streets and gotten more intelligible performances. It isn't the gore and violence that is the problem; it's the fact that the actors don't understand their lines, making it impossible for the viewer to do so.Don't waste your time and money on this."
1,"O, horrible, O, horrible, most horrible!","All I needed to see was the opening scene was this: Christopher Dunne's Titus Andronicus is the absolute worst interpretation of Shakespeare ever created! The music was badly written and played. The man playing Saturninus looked way too old to be the son of the recently deceased emperor, and the man playing Titus looked like he should have been cast as one of Shakespeare's whiney, annoying, innefectual characters. The violence was so over-the-top and disgusting, it was absolutely ridiculous. The two men doing the killing in that first scene were having far too much fun, and the facial expressions and laughter were totally out of place. I've never written this bad a review before, but now I realize it's because this movie is the first one I've found that's deserving."
1,Unbelievably Bad!,"The reviews on this page were so mixed I had to check this one out for myself. PLEASE trust me: if you know ANYTHING about Shakespeare, don't waste a penny or a second on this piece of trash. The acting is about high school level...no, make that Junior high school level, the sets and costumes are a joke, and the special gory effects that are supposed to make this a cult film are laughable. (When they cut off Titus' daughter's hands, they actually use a department store mannequin with little tubes in the middle of the wrists squirting blood.) I can only imagine the ""cult"" status is because, like Plan 9 From Outer Space, this movie is so bad its funny. Let me put it this way: if you're looking for a good Shakespeare film, this ain't it. If you're looking for a good horror film, this ain't it either. (I have a very strong suspician that the good reviews on this page are from friends or business partners of the producers!)"
1,"Never seen it, never want to.","I have never seen this movie, and, as the title suggests, I never want to. I have, however, read ""Titus Andronicus"" by William Shakespeare, and, although it is bloody and violent, it is not so much as this movie apparently portrays. And let me say this: YOU CANNOT TURN A PLAY OF SHAKESPEARE'S INTO A CULT MOVIE WITHOUT COMPLETELY RUINING AND MUTILATING IT FROM WHAT IT WAS AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE!!!!!"
5,COOL ALBUM,"I USUALLY LISTEN TO DANCE MUSIC BUT THIS CD IS GREAT. THE SONGS ARE CATCHY AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF IT. I LOVE CUENTA ME AL OIDO, IT IS SO RELAXING AND A NICE SONG TO HEAR WHEN YOU ARE STRESSED. THEY REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY AND I DEFINATELY HAVE TO SAY THAT GIRL CAN SING."
3,Service Too Slow,Delivery took way too long. I ordered two similar items from other vendors and received them right away.
4,Pretty Good,"I only knocked a star off this because I had purchased it thinking it would please me as much as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". It did. . . for the most part. There seems to be a lot of songs on here that I didn't hear at all in the movie (irritating) or I had not noticed (equally irritating, since that means the song didn't pop enough for me to notice). Other than that, not terrible in the least bit."
5,Framesi Products,I discovered these products while residing in Texas. They are easy to use and the texture is great! Never leaveshair sticky or hard. Nice and light! Especially on medium to thin hair! Their Strait Fusion is also great on taming the frizzies in the heat!
2,nothing to see here,"well, not a good showing for Mr. Strand. After reading a few of his other books, I was surprised at how shallow this effort was. Basically, the story is a straight narrative; i.e. Some goes here, someone does this, something else happens, etc. Be warned that there is zero character development and no suspense whatsoever. It reads like a bad 50's B-movie. The sub-pots are idiotic and do not advance the central story. (it has some odd convenience-store robbery sub-plot)MY ADVICE: Pass this story by!!"
1,If nothing is scary then this book/movie was terrifying!,"The book compliments a low budget, terrible acting, and a good waste of time. I've had more fun and was more afraid at the Dentist. If you are looking for something to do with your hard earned money... don't waste it on either the book or the movie!"
2,The real witch project,"I heard a radio interview with the directors and an actual witch, discussing witchcraft in the movie and the practice in real life. I ordered this book, as well as the book by the witch, called Book of Shadows. While Blair Witch is enticing, I found the truths that can be found in true witchcraft are far more fascinating and mindblowing. I think the point is not to fear the world around us, but to feel empowered by it -- and after some consideration I think this movie and companion book really miss the point."
4,IS THIS FACT OR FICTION????,"All the reviewers admit this is a fictious story, but how do you get official documents, evidence, transcripts, investigators, news footage, police affidavits, and authentic looking diary to stir up a hoax?? Forensic scientists were even involved to help bring this myth to life. No part of the book states whether this is fact or fiction. The idea is ingenious but very deceitful in portraying a real life documentary. The term dossier means a compilation of documents on a subject based on facts! I believe we should be given the facts of the case to determine what we want to be believe free of colorations. There have been actual local newspaper articles on this strange occurence with these three people. Is this whole thing BS? If these people are alive where are they? Is everyone a liar and go this far to entertain? Otherwise, a very scary movie and book."
4,An Ok Project,The book The Blair Witch Project was an ok book but they never really explained the question of the project caused by the Blair Witch or the hoax caused by the college students. The Blair Witch Project was overall a pretty good book that was spooky in some parts but also boring in others but i think that I would recomend it for other people to read and see what they think of it. My favorite part in the book was like another reader said how Helen killed the other college student. So overall i would say the book is pretty good.
5,suspenseful thriller,When I saw the movie I didnt know much at all about it but when I saw the whole thing I found out it is the BEST horror storie ever made.
4,Great companion piece for the movie!!!,"The movie 'Blair Witch' screened the footage that Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Micheal Williams made for Heather's school thesis. From the fun, frolicking beginnings of thier journey into the Black Hills, to their terrifying (supposed) demise in the strange house with written symbols inside it. This book gathers up a majority of the investigation through either interviews, local history of the Blair Witch, pictures and the best of all, Heather's Diary she was writing during their terrifying ordeal.It helps further the mythos of the Blair Witch, is she real or not? Plus also raises the question, was it all a hoax? You will find that the book does not answer any previous questions you had about the movie, it just adds a heap more (plus it makes the storyline of the movie sequel 'Book Of Shadows' even worse). Recommended for a chilling read!!!"
2,"lovely ,,, french cooking","I was hoping for a more rustic /peasent cooking style. This is true french cooking, everything made seperate then, put togther. I do not have time for this. Nice ideas on savory fillings."
1,Damn he's wack...,"Yo diz fagot is plain wack and why every one on his d*ck ? Get off it. Admit it, b*tch lynch hoe is weak and his lirycs are stupid and what he talks about? Thats for crazy white ppl coz black ppl ain't suppost be talkin bout cannibalism bullsh*t. F*cking fagotz. Anyways, Brotha lynch hung's "" season of da siccness"" is horrible and ain't even worth mention coz its prolly the worse rap record i've ever heard. Dont support diz faag."
3,Hidden Song on Screamin Ray's CD,"This cd goes from good to bad. Some songs are worth the listen, and others are good to skip. But what got me was that years after owning this cd, I found a hidden song about 12 minutes after track 10 ends. An easier way to hear it is to go to track 11, which is a few seconds of silence, and back up from there.With Crystal Lewis singing with her husband on this Cd, it is worth checking out."
4,Great album!,"I have most of the Sarah Brightman albums, but had not heard this one before. This album seems to be a mixture of show tunes (not my favorite) and some opera (which she does the best)."
1,The worst from Brazil !,"I was surprised when I noticed that the worst from Brazil has come to the Amazon hosts... unfortunately, brazilian music has been focused on vulgarity, poor artistical quality and nonsense lyrics that made me depressed... not only Karametade is a clear sign of all these bad attributes that qualify our ""music"", but there are lots of other ""musicians"" that put our culture deeper into a dirty hole (I'll not mention then, since it's not ethic - but every brazilian knows what I mean !) and make us to be ashamed to say: ""I'm brazilian"". Please, Amazon, let the world know our true musical talent. Sweep away these garbage named ""Karametade"" from your catalogs !"
2,Incredibly Over-Orchestrated Recording,"I call tell that the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir has a wonderful, rich sound -- from what little of their voices one can hear on this CD. The orchestration almost completely drowns out the human beings -- it's way, way overdone and out of balance. When I ordered this CD, I expected an exciting, vibrant, uplifting Gospel recording. This CD sounds like a bad movie score."
3,Not much info if you are looking at a 426,"An excellent manual if you are interested in the early HEMI engines, but if you are building a 426 (or as in my case, a 528) you will be disappointed."
2,Expires soon,"Purchased in Feb 2013, expires in June 2013. Not good since this item is was purchased for the first aid kit."
4,A journey thru emotions!,"The dance songs range from 118 bpms to 136. Inbetween are a series of beautiful love songs. ""Parlez moi de lui"" will keep you hitting the repeat button. Throw dishes on the greek ""La danse de Zorba"",sway on her version of ""La vie en rose"" or shake a dirty sock on ""AMOR AMOR"">>>INDEED!!!!"
2,"Cheaply Made, But Ok for the Price...","I bought this mirror because my old one broke and I was looking for an upgrade. The reason I was really interested by this mirror was its large size. It actually is pretty big for a handheld mirror, its a really great feature. But, I have to stay, I was really disappointed by the quality of the handlebar. It's so flimsy! I swear I'll probably break it by the end of the month, and i just got the mirror today. Normally, you'd expect a handlebar on a mirror to be firm and strong, but this is the opposite! The mirror handle and the back of the mirror are just a cheap piece of plastic that encase the mirror. I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. I would have much better preferred to have paid a few extra dollars for a better quality handle. I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for..."
1,Flimsy plastic,"The plastic is so flimsy that the mirror wiggles when you pick it up. I do not expect it to last long. Needless to say, it is very disappointing and a total waste of money."
2,Box with 12 glasses of beer only 4 turn on the light!!!!,"I buy one box with 12 glasses of beer only 4 turn on the light, I am very disappointed because I bought to use at the party and not worked. I need 24 batteries for them to work, i think you should supplied me with it, let me know what you want to do! I buy lot stuff from you!!"
2,No effort!,"This film had no effort put into it. With so many great players to talk about, it was a particularily dry film. The selection of clips that were supposed to offer insight into the players greatness were often poorly chosen, while little information was uncovered. This movie only has a purpose if you want to know who was actually on the team, but nothing else will be gained from this film. Noteworthy is the absence of Clyde Drexler and Christian Laettner, because this film was made in 1991---before the two were named to the team and a whole year before the team played their first game."
4,Tie clip B30,"I received this product in a timely manner and my order was correct. Although, the button eyelet seperated from the chain. Since the material that the chain is made of is very weak I never could make the eyelet to stay attached."
3,Oy My Head Hurts!,"This movie is bizarre to say the very least. I did not find it to be boring but it is a little hard to follow at times. It is weird and not for anyone who likes their movies to have a definative ending. This movie offers no answers and leaves the viewer to desphifer what they saw and make their own decisions on what actually happened.The acting is very good and the movie is made even more tolerable with the casting of GORGEOUS, FLAWLESS Colin Firth as the supposed psycho. No one truly ever made mental instability so appealing.All in all, it is an acquired taste meant for those who favor their movies to go deep into the mind and make you think."
1,Boring is too good a word for this.,"Watching this makes watching grass grow look good. I cannot believe Colin Firth would make a movie that is beyond amateurish. I've seen bad movies and this is as bad as it can be. It seemed to be about five hours long, 4 hours and 59 seconds too long.If you suffer from insomnia, this would be a great aid to make you sleep."
1,Pretty Silly,Just your average bland-o Hootie & The Blowfish type stuff. Pretty boring. Sorry I took a chance on it.
1,Sound recorded under a waterfall?,This software was a complete waste of money. The layout of the software is very confused and there is no guide for the user to follow. The biggest problem with the software is the sound quality. The recordings are so noicy that I got a pain in my head after just a few minutes. The speaker are frequently cut short a few ms or the recording start or stops with a *pop*. The amazingly poor sound is combined with a really unclear voice from the speaker. (The girl sounds like she has some thing in her mouth) I saw PowerJapanese at a freinds house but it was unavalible. So I got this... I will now start looking for PJ in the used section.
4,Great for hand Eye Coordination,My son can sit and play with this for hours. Had no problems with the latch...nothing has broken in a year
4,Candelabra Shade,"Attractive, detailed and a fine replacement for the previous shade on my antique art deco lamp. Only criticism would be the metal clips were difficult to form to the shape of the bulb since they are manufactured flat and are quite stiff ."
1,pathetic,"i dont know where to start, the raptors are depicted as fat, slow, dumb animals who has to get shot 554 times before they die the acting is really pathetic and laughable. So this is pretty much a thing to watch if you absolutely have nothing else to do and if you want a good laugh. peace out!"
5,amazon you are not right,"Phil Collins did never better singing than drumming...perhaps he's not as subtile now as he was with Brand x, that's true but i'm a drummer and i know some things about drumming and what he did with genesis in the 70's on drums was great...HE's surely one of the 100 most impressive drummers of our century but i don't think that he's part of the 100 best singers"
3,Not a keeper.... Forgettable :(,"I thought the hero annoying, and it ruined the entire book. I found myself just wanting the story to end already, and that is never the case when I thoroughly enjoy a book. I get how at first he is reluctant to be with her, but he ridicules and doubts her on too many occasions. It was irritating to say the least! Then the heroine is just as annoying because she just takes it. Not one I would think about again."
5,I love Kat Martin's Books.,This was a great book. I love how she allows you to meet secondary characters that you will find in future books. The one thing I wish she had done differently in this book was to just introduce Gwen and Adam. I found that I was excited to read their story as much as the main characters Matt and Jessie. And was a little bummed when she quickly had Adam rescue Gwen and marry her. I thought there could have been another good book there. If you love Kat Martin you will love this book.
2,Ho Hum..,"It's amazing,this book was written in 1996 ,and nobody has bothered to write a Customer Review yet.Maybe I was the first to buy it.The picture on the front sort of tells it all.The book was a light-hearted, off-the- wall kind of summer afternoon read.His comment ""Now I tell you honestly,unidentified bodies in the morgue have a higher recognition rating in Canada than writers."" ""Saying I was deflated is like saying the Hindenburg was just a little late in arriving"".This was one of the better lines in the book;not surprising a writer of such stature gets little recognition.His French motto ""In War,We Surrender;In Peace,We Detonate Nuclear Bombs"" really doesn't break any new ground.I guess the cover picture shows what it's like for a struggling Canadian writer to crank out something in return for the grants from the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council who supported the development and writing of this book.Look out World, the Taxpayers of Canada are on the move!!"
3,Very practical,"It's not too hard to assemble. I assembled it without power tool or help. Make sure that you have a hammer before you started. Usually a city girl doesn't have a hammer at home, but a city girl definitely needs a shoes cabinet like this. Now the entrance of my door is clear! The shoes cabinet seems very durable. It doesn't have the look that you feel it's going to fall apart. Well, it's two hundred something after tax and shipping. It better lasts! The only thing I'm not happy about is there are some defects on the surface of the cabinet. It seems that some board got hit during the transportation. After I assembled the whole thing, one of the drawer's eage and a little area of the bottom of the side board looked chipped. Since I paid more than $50 for shipping and handling, I should have gotten a better deliver service! Well, I guess those deliver mem don't care. I thought of complaint, but I wouldn't want to get a new set and assemble again..."
1,Saga Continues,"Well, we got the parts that were damaged (some of them) after two weeks and finally got around to fixing it and now find that one of the washers that needs to go in the side to hold the door up is also missing...sigh! So we have a shoe cabinet with one of the doors hanging off one side!! So now we are going to be back to asking the manufacturer to send us that small piece....Really!"
1,problematic coupler,"I recently purchased a Lincoln 1134 grease gun. Its well constructed and the level delivers more than adequate pressure. BUT the coupler is nothing but problems. It fits on a grease fitting easily, but will not come off. I have to unscrew the tip to remove it. Not only is this a major pain, but it also causes the grease fittings to loosen.There is another Amazon review that talks about problems removing the coupler - but it gives the problem 5 stars. If you have to wrestle with the gun with each grease fitting, its not very useful.One more thing - the instructions are really lame. I took apart the coupler, hoping to find some problem and referred to the parts diagram to reassemble. Low and behold - the coupler parts are not shown in the diagram.I've registered a complaint on Linclon's website, but have yet to hear from them."
5,What would you expect from Lincoln,You can't lose with a Lincoln. Words to live by! This gun outperforms any I had used previously. Those stuck zircs that will force air into another gun don't stand a chance with this model. Love it!
2,somewhat of a disappointment,It looks good but does not load easily. The piston hangs up on the lip of the grease cartridges. The pump seems to produce only half of the stroke of grease - like there is some air in the system. It does not work as well as an older John Deere branded grease gun that I also use. I would not buy again.
5,Time to Toss out the Lever-Action Grease gun,I've been struggling for years with my lever action grease gun as you really do need a third hand to use it. I finally got fed up enough and did some research on-line and noticed the LINCOLN model had the best ratings. I love the way it locks onto a fitting and doesn't leak all round the sides of the fitting instead of going into the fitting as my old gun did....(made a mess and wasted grease) The Lincoln forces all the grease into the fitting easily...once you snap onto the fitting you only need ONE hand to operate! This is a quality piece of equipment and worth every penny especially with the best price and free shipping from Amazon. Now I wont get aggravated and talk myself out of greasing the cars and lawn tractor as I should be.....THANK YOU LINCOLN INDUSTRIAL 1134.....
4,nice blend of today's female R&B superstars,"This is a 2 cd set from England including 38 tracks. Both discs are full of enough hits to keep any R&B fan happy, and the material that did not see chart action in North America is pretty decent stuff as well. You get to hear your faves like 702's ""Where My Girls At?"", Faith Evans' ""Love Like This"", En Vogue's ""Whatever"", Nicole's ""Make It Hot"", Foxy Brown's ""Hot Spot"", Blackstreet & Janet's ""Girlfriend/Boyfriend"", Tatyana Ali's ""Daydreamin'"", Mary J Blige's ""All That I Can Say"" & ""Seven Days"" and Des'ree's ""You Gotta Be"" alongside of lesser known tracks like D'Bora's ""Honey"", Deetah's ""Relax"", Beverly Knight's ""Greatest Day"" and N-Tyce's ""Telefunkin"" to name a few. A very solid purchase especially if you do not want to purchase the individual albums of all of the artists featured on this compilation."
3,Interesting Look at First Contact,"West of the Sun is, I think, a very early work by Edgar Pangborn. I ran across it and was pleasantly surprised that it's still good. Yes, it has a major flaw that really isn't the author's fault, the attitude towards women. At least the women take an active part in the story, but they're still out of the 1950s. That aside, this is a good account of first contact with not one but two alien races on a planet. The little group of six astronauts accidentally land in a messy conflict, on top of which they have their own conflicts within their group. Everything is nicely drawn and I like the fact that the end of the story is not the end but clearly a beginning for all three races."
1,"Good gift idea, poor quality item","I read about the ritual of yerba mate inHow I Write: The Secret Lives of Authors (Hardcover), and I had an Amazon gift certificate so I figured I'd check it out. Unfortunately, this gift set isn't a good place to start. While the bombilla is OK and the yerba is fair, the gourd is weak. It cracked during the curing and remained soft after drying. For the same price of this kit, you can choose a sturdier gourd, a nicer bombilla and a kilo of yerba at a place that really knows what this stuff is all about. Google ""yerba mate tea gourd"" or go to yerbamateteagourd dot com. I give this one star because it's the only set available on Amazon, and I think Guayaki is trying to do a good thing. Might be OK for your first yerba mate, but do yourself a favor and comparative shop at the suggested link. If yerba mate is a ritual, you'll enjoy the ability to pick and choose your kit and kilo."
2,Tastes awful!,"I had high hopes for this product. Heard so much good stuff about hoodia. But this sad to say, did nothing. And it tasted like pure alcohol with grass in it! Had to drink something with a lot of flavor to it while taking it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money- Rent It First,"We bought this for our 8 year old son. He likes role playing games and Disney. We thought this would be a good combination. There is really no storyline. The only objective is to ""dance"" to the right combination of buttons. My son no challange in this. He finished the game in less than 1 hour and was very disappointed.If you have kids, or even for yourself, get KINGDOM HEARTS. This game will become a classic. Both my kids loved it. After they finished KINGDOM HEARTS they were sad that it ended and they started it all over again.So NO TO JUNGLE BOOK and YES TO KINGDOM HEARTS"
5,loved it,"This book illuminated on how society has designated privileged roles to one gender over the other. The story was engaging, and the use of menwim, wim, penhoes and other new words made the book even more engaging. Story is very captivating. I would like to see a sequel to this book."
3,WCW Spring Stampede 1994 Review,"This was the first Spring Stampede, and quite possibly, the best. This video had great matches like Sting vs. Rick Rude for the International title and Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat for the world heavyweight belt. I would buy this video for $10 because I don't know where else you can get it for that price. Probably the best match on the card was Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys in one heck of a fight. The Steamboat-Flair match has a very odd, but exciting ending. Much similar to their match at Clash of the Champions VI: The Ragin' Cajun. All in all, it was one of the best WCW cards of the year. 1994 wasn't a great year financially for WCW, but they had guys like Ric Flair and Vader that carried the company on their back. This video is highly recommended."
4,Excellent album,"This a great album, and in every way just as good as Chaos Born. Apparently they got a new singer on this album, but he sounds EXACTLY the same so don't worry. I only detract from this album because it's a little on the short side (9 original tracks, 47 minutes total).Would've liked more content, but a great album none the less."
1,very user unfriendly,I would not recomend this product to anyone.There is no way that a person that has limited time available could expect to gain any thing from this product.I honestly believe that I have not gained a single word to my spanish vocabulary from what I knew going in to this program
1,The absolute worest . . .,"If I could have given this a 1/2 or a zero star, I would have. One star is too generous.I have used the ""Smart Start Spanish Deluxe"" software by Syracuse Language which is very, very good and entertaining. I recently switched from a PC to an Apple Computer. Unfortunately, ""Smart Start Spanish Deluxe"" doesn't work on an Apple Comuter so I ended up purchasing ""Learn Spanish Now."" What a BIG MISTAKE!""Learn Spanish Now"" is not very user friendly. It's also very boring. It is probably better suited to an advance beginner or intermediate student and someone who can drink many strong cups of coffee to keep awake.If you're looking to buy a good Spanish language software, keep on looking. You'll be wasting your time and money on ""Learn Spanish Now."""
3,Missing some key stuff IMO,"No a-ha?No Dido's ""Thank You"" or ""White Flag"".No Green Day doing ""We Will Rock You""?Very disappointed in those omissions. Just an FYI, as I'm still giving the set 3 stars. Sound and video quality is excellent."
1,Cheap knock-off,"Not the real thing. Don't even think of using out-doors. Save your money and use masking tape, it will do just as well as these."
1,Gun does not work,I love Duck Hunt the game but was very disappointed when trying to play the game that the gun I ordered did not work at all.
4,Good read,Part of a series and very interesting. Here we go again with a quota of words needed to submit. end
2,Disappointed,"I read the book he co-authored with Robert Kiyosaki ""Why we want you to be rich"" and I liked it! So I decided to read some more of Trump, but without flicking through this book as I was catching a plane to Korea. I was disappointed as it is just a bunch of affirmations really. Sure.. good advicefrom people who know how to get things done. But I was hoping to get more insights into investing."
3,Some good advice,"The key word is ""some"". Most of the advice is commonsense or if you don't have any, I take it back. This book is just a compilation of advice from successful business contacts of Trump. Trump doesn't really offer any advice except a few lines in the introduction."
4,3 and 5 year old love Bullfrog Grows Up,A short but sweet tale. Makes a great bed time story that has instantly become a nightly request from my 3 and 5 year old.
3,Good For Younger Kids.,"I first got into Pokemon at the end of 5th grade. I bought the Pokemon blue version and thought it was the coolest videogame ever! But then I entered into Middle School and soon the Pokemon craze faded away. I now think their just stupid and pointless. Don't buy this game if your about to go into middle school. You'll soon findout that their just a ""little kid thing."""
4,Wish it wasn't only Highlights,"This cd if I am correct left out at least Duettino: Via, resti servita, which I think should be included in the performance or a Highlights cd shouldn't be considered sold at all. I'm looking for this same performance but in whole, not having any luck as of yet.The rest is superb, if I had to nit pick Figaro seems a little sleepy and behind the ladies. The overall pace is slowish which is very nice for the female solos in particular but the tempo at times could use a little kick in the pants for me. Rene Jacob's version is hip hop in comparison, for the most part appreciated more by yours truly. But the ladies singing in this version are just angelic."
2,mapsend 3d topo,i was disappointed. it is outdated material.it is missing many trails i use out in utah. 4 wheeler trails. i could not use this to find out where i was on half of the trails i rode. gps's have come a long ways in a few years. there are better topo's available.
4,BRINGS BACK THE MEMORIES,"From 1970 to 74 my family was stationed in Germany. My father was a thirty-year army man and this was our second tour in europe. I was grade school age and just about the only american entertainment around was the base movie house. Anyway, every saturday afternoon they showed a couple of serial chapters with a feature. The Masked Marvel was one of the ones I remember most. However, on the day that the last chapter was to be shown I had the flu and i never did get to see how it ended. THANK GOD FOR VIDEO! It's still great after all these years."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"This book was misrepresented in it's description. The book has a brand new modern looking cover but is anything but modern, in it's title or content. The text was a xerox copy of the original 1945 version from the government printing offce (original price $1.50). This book is fine for the old school nastalgic types that have lost their original copy. This text has little or no use for the present day deck officer or cargo terminal employee."
3,Surprisingly fun to watch,"I got this movie with the full expectation that it would be terrible. But it wasn't! (Last Airbender was -- what the heck happened to M.Knight?)... Anyway, The Sorcerer's Apprentice was fun and entertaining and Nic Cage is only slightly annoying. There are some great action sequences, especially those involving mirrors."
5,Rocks..,Awesome movie. Highly recommend. This movie does not disappoint. Has been out awhile but I would still watch at the drop of a hat.
5,The Sorcerer's Apprentice Blue-Ray/DVD Combo,"I liked the whole buy Blue-Ray/DVD idea but I've never gave it a try; after I saw Sorcerer's Apprentice I decided to give it a try. I must admit; I'm very surprised.The image is clear, the blue-ray is filled with goodies, the DVD also some bits of good magic-making features. The items were well protected and delived before the estimated time the information said. The best part; no shipping because I pre-ordered. Love the idea and will continue to buy!"
1,No Disney connection,Awful all the way around. Cage just out for another paycheck turning the promise of an old classic into a modern day Harry Potter rip off. A weak lead with strength in poorly supporting roles makes this waste hard to sit through
4,Disney goes on...,"This was a very cute movie...I mean to say for family viewing ""clean"" ... I truely thought for a humanized Disney re-make, this would have taken on much more of the story than it did. If this had been 120 min. it would have rocked ! BUT good none the less."
2,HO HUM,"This looks wonderful in blu-ray but it really is so, well, boring. I don't want to waste any more time."
5,Sorcerer's Apprentice,This is one of the DVD's that our grandson wanted for Christmas. It was offered at a good price and I know he enjoys watching it.
3,Magic and special effects,"This movie is about warlocks, sorcerers, magic and spells, sothe suspension of disbelief is a must. But even so, Iwould have cut the mop scene out. Also perhaps too muchof throwing plasma balls at each other.I liked the special effects, the plot was fine. The apprenticewas a mis-cast. China town scene was pretty amazing.All in all this is a good entertaining family movie."
4,Sorcerer's apprentice really good movie,"Good movie for the whole family. Not too dumb, but interesting. Rally liked the acting. All really good actors in it and exciting."
3,Sorcerer's Apprentice,"The movie is entertaining in its own way, but at the same time feels bland and uninspiring. The special effects and fight scenes make up for some of this, but I just never found myself caring that much about what I was watching. The movie feels like it skips over things and rushes through too much to truly connect to it in almost any way. The character of the Apprentice is played in a way that makes you want to punch him in the face as much as see him succeed in becoming Merlin's heir. For Nicolas Cage, this is one more mediocre performance to add to his career. The people playing the evil characters were more interesting, but also not really used effectively. This movie should have been longer, or split into more than one movie to spread out the story more. The way it is now will keep you entertained, but also not particularly impressed with what you are watching. Its an average movie."
3,Just OK,"The movie as a whole was OK, nice escapism. The character of Dave was irritating as the devil though. I don't know if it was the actor or the way he was told to play the part, but I found myself trying to ignore him as much as possible. Since he's in practically every scene, it was difficult to enjoy the movie that much."
2,Not the greatest but not the worse,I bought these to use on international trip. The size combinations are not great and the bags were awkward to use. Decided against using them as I could pack more without the compression bags. Would be good for organizing but a little too flimsy for bulky items.
5,Eagle Creek Travel Pack-It Medium/Large Compression Sac Set,Quite happy with this product. The material is thick and of good quality. Product does work but you have to really use some muscle to get all the air out of the bag. Will recommend this product.
3,Good Compilation,"I'm a big fan of ""Fly Life"" and that encouraged me to buy the CD. Needless to say, I had never heard many of the tracks before but I enjoyed them anyway. The CD order of tracks was off but that was the only flaw."
5,Que viva Ferreira! Dedo Arriba...,"Un grupo excelente de rock y pop, va por lo alto... Vale la pena tener en el repertorio de CD's el Viaje. Nena es el gran exito, esta en los primeros listados de la musica latina."
2,Somewhat a disappointment,"After reading John Knowles' A Separate Peace, I anticipated great things from Peace Breaks Out. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Although Knowles talent at creating vivid characters and imagery survived, the intriguing and touching plot did not. The book did not leave me feeling like a changed person in the way that A Separate Peace did. I would recommend you read it, but don't expect too much."
3,Harvard Business Review on Knowledge Management,"Used as a textbook for a leadership course. It is o.k., have read more interesting pieces of KM. Recommend if you need scholarly material."
1,Boombox was defective.,"When I received the Stiletto Boombox, the speakers on the left side of the radio were blown and the sound wass horrible. I called several times and finally I was given my refund."
3,Son likes it but not as much as Gold Version,"My son wanted the Red Version soooo bad, so he used some of his allowance to get it. He likes it but he'd much rather play the Gold Version that he's had for much longer."
4,A ot of fun!,In pokemon red you don't just catch pokemon you train them and play with them then you get the link and you can chalange you friends to battle. Pokemon red is a fun (yet chalanging)game for young minds to decide how to raise their pokemon
4,A good old Fashioned Pokemon.,"I love this game, but i personally believe that Pokemon yellow is so much better, but anyone looking for a good Pokemon game, this is the way to go."
5,Great game!,"Great game. Was one of Nintendo's best handheld/GameBoy/Pokemon games if not the best. Only thing I dont like though, is that although it can pretty fun most of your time is spent training to defeat super high level pokemon or long/tedious battles. Great game overall, great start for the Pokemon series, but needs more adventure and less battling."
3,Not great,"I bought this based on the great reviews, so perhaps it was a let-down because I had high expectations. This is a guide book with a slight dog orientation, but honeselty, I didn't feel like this really gave me much valuable information about living and traveling in the DC area with a dog- other than telling me where parks are (info available on many web sites). The actual dog-friendliness of the parks, and rating system seemed totally off with how I would have rated parks. Seems like they are rated more for person-appeal than dog-appeal.But maybe I'm just biased as I have a hound and value FENCED off-leash parks above all :)"
5,"Good music, bad CD.","The music is beyond comments, it's absolutely great and unquestionable. Thad Jones is one of the greatest arrangers ever, period. This is the original band, Hank Jones on piano, and it's a killer band, maybe the best jazz big band ever. But the CD I got is terrible. The actual artifact I bought is very poorly made, probably with cheap materials and so on. Track 12 doesn't play well, it's full of errors, and in the case I try it on the computer, it simply ejects the CD. I extracted track 12 on another computer and the audio file itself contains the errors, very weird. Never seen this before. So it's very irritating because it's a historic event, imagine the first night of this band at the Vanguard, and so I had to contain my impulses of throwing the CD out the window when I reached track 12, which is nothing less than ""A Little Pixie"" (on the CD as ""The Little Pixie""), the track I've been waiting desperately for during the previous tracks. I hope it's just this CD..."
2,"Lacks ""hold"" button...","I have a PEG-S320, the precursor to the S360. The clie is a good value, in many ways better than what Palm has to offer, but it has a couple of design flaws. Sony can be kind of arrogant in its cost-cutting:- There is no ""recharge"" indicator LED on the unit or on the power adapter. There is the lighning bolt that appears when it is turned on, but an indicator light on the power plug would be useful too.- There is no hold button, so the Clie spontaneously discharges itself in your pocket. This has happened to me a number of times. For some reason the buttons are just especially easy to press by mistake.- In my particular case, the Clie stopped working after about 6 months of light use. It just would not turn on. Sony tried having me recharge/reset it, but since there is no indicator light, there is no way of knowing if the problem is with the AC adapter or with the unit..."
4,"Attractive, efficient and great value for money","Im delighted with this entry level PDA. As always, Sony has a great looking product with everything you need on it - and more. Used to own the Palm III xe - the Sony beats it handsdown.Couple of issues - the screen resolution, while just a number (160 x 160) is a little poor....Instinctively, I was looking for the screen backlight in the hope visibility would improve.Other than that - typical palm navigation - the jog dial is useful. The packaged software - a lot of it expires in 30 days ...you will have to pay afterwards !"
3,George,Well recorded technically. Heard some instruments for the first time. The fourth movements of Symphony 1 and 4 were not as good as in other recordings. Much too slow and it was painful to listen to. This was not really worth the price.
2,Historical Fiction based on Strongbow and Aoife,"This is not one of Llywelyn's better efforts. The book is historical fiction loosely based on Strongbow and his Irish wife, Aoife. It is written in first person alternating between two narrators which requires, at times, keeping track of who is talking. Considering the emphasis the book seems to place on wives and daughters, it completely neglects any mention of the daughter of Strongbow and Aoife who was the heiress who inherited his estates (he had no surviving sons). It is at odds, on various points, with conventional history and genealogy and is not recommended as a source. Llywelyn could have done much better."
3,"An interesting book, although not one of her best.","I'm a huge fan of Llywelyn, and have read most of her books. This one isn't one of her best, although it does have some interesting information about 12th century Ireland. The book is historical fiction based on Richard ""Strongbow"" and his Irish wife, Aoife.The book is written in the first person, alternating between Strongbow and Aoife narrating a chapter. This can be a bit hard to follow at times.The reading is relatively easy even with the first person writings. Unless you are an avid Llywelyn fan buy one of her other fantastic books."
1,"Nicely written, but very flawed","Poor use of source material and an apparent preformed bias against Richard III makes this supposed ""historical"" work into a nothing more than a nice fiction story.I was very disappointed in the author, as I have enjoyed some of her previous work. Please *don't* take this work as a good historical reference of the Richard III controversy."
1,One star too many -- make it zero,"Please move past this book and read Ross, Field, Tey, Kendall or just about anyone else on this subject. Weir approaches the issue with an obvious bias which results in her taking sources out of context or making tremendous leaps of intuition."
5,"Perfect, No problems",We hooked out Zodiac PB4-60 up and it worked like a dream. There have not been any issues. It has plenty of power to run our new Polairs Vac-Sweep 360 like a dream. Highly recommend this pump.
3,misleading picture,I bought this product based on the pictures to replace my pump. It showed my old pump pictures so I bought it. It arrived and it was a different model.
3,short and sweet,"I bought this book for an introductory class in audiology. Thus far, I am fairly unsatisfied with its condensed treatment of sine waves, the anatomy of the ear, and explanation of dB. As an introductory student, not only was I confused by the first chapter, but I was also astounded that an author would attempt to describe anatomy verbally without relevant figures. Past the first chapter, thing calm down a bit, but the amount of information crammed into the first 50 pages is a bit much. I'd rather have paid extra money for a longer book with a better explanation. However, if the basics of anatomy and acoustics aren't new to you, I suggest this as a good starting point."
2,Mine was defective,Normally these work good but I received this one defective. I am a professional operator and general contractor and have used any of these that work good.
2,My 7 year old was bored,"Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good. It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed. The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl. It was really just plain boring."
5,Great for Kids and People who like our World,"This book was so beautiful. I love unicorns and dragons, so it was great seeing the two together. i liked this book because of the story it depicted, and that is that we can all be at peace with the world, and those around us. I recommend this book for people of all ages. it is beautifully illustrated and is full of love!"
3,Quaint and cute,"I want to preface this by saying I just don't understand Jennifer Garner's appeal. Sure, she's 13 going on 30, but somewhere around 25 there was an incident with hormone therapy and a malpractice suit. The first part of the movie takes place in 1987 in a town that doesn't listen to music made after 1983. (Bonus points for The Go-Go's being on the soundtrack.) Having a small place in my heart for romantic comedies, I was pleasantly pleased."
5,GOOOD!,"Its awsome you need to see it. It has great lessons about life! I loved it! I watched it with my 7 year old cousin I don;t think she understood it, but she told me she love it too!"
4,13 Going on 30,"It is a fun movie -- I saw it in the theatre and really loved the scene when they dance to ""Thriller"" -- I enjoy watching that scene over and over!!"
5,Go Jennifer!! It's your birthday!!,"Jennifer Garner (Alais) stars as Jenna Rink, a 13 year old who doesn't really fit in with the popular group of girls. She only has one friend Matt (Mark Ruffalo) they are BEST FRIENDS. This movie reminds me of Tom Hank's classic Big but this is a girl version of that movie. Jennifer Garner really shines as Jenna, a girl who want's to grow up in a hurry. Her birthday wish was to be 30, flirty, and thriving and that's just what she got! Suddenly, her whole teenage life passed by when she wakes up and discovers she is thirty years old and also has a boyfriend. She finds out that she is the editor at Pose, her favorite magazine in the world!! Also, her best friend is Lucy, one of the most popular girls that treated her like she was a nobody!! Besides that, this is a good movie!! Jennifer is the bomb!! This is also a chick flick that you will love!! I know I did!! Go Jennifer!!"
5,Fun and light hearted,"I really enjoyed this movie, it is cute, funny and left me with a smile on my face when it ended. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Chick flick that even my husband loves,Jennifer Garner is wonderful in this. Can't imagine anyone else in the roll. So funny and with enough in depth stroy line that even my honey like to watch it.
1,Not Received,"I have not received this item yet and i ordered it over a month now. I would really appreciate if this could be sent as soon as possible. I dont know if it was sent and got lost in the mail, but i dont have it. please write me back.Thanks big time!!!!Sincerly, Joshua K."
4,"The ""I got divorced"" album","In a recent interview, Tom Petty said that this was not an ""I got divorced"" album. I'm not too sure I believe that as this is an epically sad compilation. In the past, he has been angry at loss, or sarcastic about it, or even momentarily frightened. In the songs contained in this album he seems to have been existentially scarred by whatever happened. Within the context of the album even the ""I'm OK"" and the story songs sound like he's trying really hard to convince both us and himself.He is still a great rock and roller, and I really enjoy his music. I love the almost tragic songs on this album but I still like to hear him kick the doors down every now and then. Think I'll go pop ""Long After Dark"" in the stereo."
5,Uplifting!,"Tom is a great artist and this album is a great one that won't disappoint.It is reminiscent of earlier works, laid back, mellow in a lot of ways, yet kick ass in others. You'll play it all the time. Great guitar solos."
1,Echo,"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers's Echo is a very laidback effort. Room at the Top is a pretty good song, but the majority of the songs sound to lazy and are unmemorable. Echo is a very lame album considering the highstandards Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers usually produce. Skip this one."
4,Not their best...,"...but a solid effort. He is better for some crazy reason when he bills himself solo, even though he uses the same guys. He'll never top Full Moon Fever, an album that ultimately will be regarded as his masterpiece."
3,"A Big Tom Petty fan. However, not that impressed.","I have to say that I am a huge Petty fan. Have been for over 20 years. However, can't get past the fact that he needs to get back to his ""Damn the Torpedos"" days. Leave the Bob Dylan singing to Bob Dylan and sometimes Jeff Lynn."
4,"Not their best, but pretty darn close!!!","When I first heard there was a new Tom Petty album coming out I was thrilled. I'm a huge Tom Petty fan and I couldn't wait. Then when I heard some of the reviews I was, initially, disapointed. Nevertheless, I rushed out to buy the album. That was three weeks ago. I think I've listened to a hundred times since then. It's great (probably four and a half stars), but not quite as good as Full Moon Fever, or Into the Great Wide Open. Then again, those two albums are among the greatest albums of all time! Echo is probably the best rock album of the year. I can't wait for the next TP album!"
2,Sorry I can't recommend this one...,"Tom Petty is the master of simply-written songs. He can do more with three chords than most songwriters can with 20, as demonstrated on his masterpiece, ""Wildflowers"". On ""Echo"", most of the songs aren't very hooky. Petty just seems muddled in his songwriting. The band went for more of a garage type feel for this album and succeeded sonically, but the songs shouldn't suffer. While not every song on here is shoddy, I don't like enough of them to recommend the album."
1,Not sturdy,"I was very disappointed, it was easy to put together but does not hold the cage. As soon as you put the cage on, it tips over."
1,Worthless bird cage stand,"I bought the cage and the stand together and it was a total waste of money. This stand is so flimsy that it's almost impossible to balance a bird cage, which I bought with this, without it tipping. It went to the Goodwill the day I got it."
4,Very satisfied,"I was very concerned at first when I received my stand. The box was very damaged...large tears in the box as it is shipped in a very flimsy cardboard box. However, the stand itself is in great shape and was so easy to put together. This is exactly what I wanted for my birds. It is very light weight so it's easy to move from one room to another."
4,Good Stand,The stand is solid and study. Good enough to hold a normal size bird cage. For the price I would recommend this stand.
5,The Best,This is 1 of the best soundtracks ever. every song on here is a classic. from start to finish it is sheer classicness. There could've been more songs but most CDs could have more songs.Does any one know the song that was playing on the record player when they all got busted by Mr Funderburk in their dormroom?
4,Roundabout,The answer to the question of the song playing in the guy's room when they get busted by Funderdurk is called Roundabout by YES.
5,3 cheers for a great read!,This book is so good and a breath of fresh air. The bad part is having to put it down.
4,It's Method Actor!,The Method Actor CD is now available for the many Eva fans who requested it. It should be noted that this is not a Eva solo release so don't expect it to sound like Songbird. Method Actor was the band Eva sang with when she was introduced to Chris Biondo and these songs represent her first efforts in a real studio. It's really for the Eva fan who cant get enough.
1,dear god no,"The current state of popular music is the worst it's ever been. Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Brittney Spears, etc. etc. and now this guy. it's out of control. isn't this one of the signs of the impending apocalypse? egads"
5,:),"This alblum has been an essentail part of my family's Christmas tradition for as long as I can rememeber. Like many have said, we owned the cassette, but it has worn out. I am so glad to find the cd. I just can't imagine decorating the tree without these beloved songs."
5,This is what I was looking for.,I found this book very useful for me. There is a lot of information I don't know in the book. I'm very glad I bought it. I would buy second book from the same author.
4,Good place to start,"This book is a great place to start if you're interested in learning outdoor survival. Very practical, not just what to do, but how to think when you're if you're stuck in a survival situation. Clear directions, simple illustrations. Not as dry as, say, a Boy Scout manual."
1,The silicone tears,"Only last about a year before the silicone started tearing and peeling off. It was nice when we had it, but didnt take long to become junk. Do not buy unless you like buying a new rolling pin every year!"
3,TWO WAY STREET,I haven't gotten the cd yet but I am going to. I heard TWO WAY STREET on the Deliver Us from Eva soundtrack and could not get enough. I decided to do a search to see if she had more to offer and she does. I listen to a sample of the cd and liked what I heard. I agree with the other opinion she was not well promoted. I wish her the best.
4,I'm very proud you finally released an album. Work Girl!,"Terry And Company, G.Town Entertainment. Your On your way You look great. Sound great. Very excited for you Renee Ochoa"
4,Pretty good entry in the series,"This book is not as memorable as some of the others in the series, but for entertaining military sci-fi, this book can foot the bill. The tactics are smallish in scale, and there's a new alien race to contend with, but this book can pass the time as a decent read."
3,What a shame!,"The Ultrasone's sound very good and do a good job of canceling noise. I tested them first listening to music, then I started playing a video game. I couldn't have been happier with their performance. But the big problem was after only about 20 mins they started getting tight and were getting warm. 30 mins into my test they were very tight and my ears were sweating. There's no way that I could wear these for more than 30 mins without takeing them off for a few mins. I used them a little bit everyday for about 2 weeks trying to break them in without success. The bottom line is I'm back to using my $35.00 Koss Porta pros."
1,Does not stay on....only 1 month old,"I have this for one month and only used it for 3 hours in the garage and basement. Now, the heater keeps going off. The phone number for tech/customer service does not work at Mr. Heater....The no. is off of the instructions and the same no. at MrHeater.com.Don,t waste your money. Mr Heater sucks. 0 stars Best to buy an electric or another brand."
2,Coming of age story falls flat,"Hawn is a single mother trying to raise her 12-year-old son by bartending, waitressing, and stripping in a small coastal Florida town in the summer of 1969 (there are various mentions of the impending Apollo 11 moon landing and the war in Vietnam throughout the film). The son, struggling to deal with his mother's nightly activities and a weakening hope that his father will return, tries to raise money to help his situation by ripping off a drug smuggling scam and selling the goods on the side. The Florida scenery is very appealing and well shot by former award-winning cinematographer-turned director Chris Menges, but what might have been a touching story gets bogged down in a somewhat convoluted and hard-to-swallow plot. The talents of veteran actors Goldie Hawn, Keith Carradine, and Arliss Howard are wasted here, and young David Arnott gives a particulary wooden and at times annoying performance. Based on a novella by Scott Sommer (he also wrote the screenplay)."
3,Not too bad,Interesting movie. I wanted more insight on Key West before a vacation. I't never a waste of time to see Goldie running around.
4,Background info useful,I would recommend this commentary for study or teaching/preaching in a church setting. The author provides useful background information on the culture of the time and brings out some points missing in other commentaries.
3,Did not get a chance to use this book,"I purchased this book to get to know Access 2002 in depth, but my company upgraded to Office 2007 so I had to start all over again!! 8-("
3,"Nice, but not quite as advertised","This is a nice slip-case, but I doubt that it's leather and it bears no resemblance to the case described in the other review (for example, no pockets, no ID card window, no velcro that attaches to the Mako). It provides a tight protective cover into which the Mako slips pretty easily, but not so easily that it will fall out. The way it's constructed, however, means that you could still injure your Mako if you drop it on the unprotected end. Also, the cover is soft so it won't protect against all injuries anyway. But it will keep your Mako from getting banged up in a purse or briefcase. And it doesn't take up much more room than the Mako itself."
5,My Favorite Perfume,I love this perfume and always get compliments when I wear it. The price was great and I didn't have any problems with shipping. It arrived in the expected time frame.
3,unappreciated gift,It was a gift for my husband and he didn't like it. Too slow in the beginning. So it sits on his kindle unread.
5,Arrigato Gozaimasu Alex Kerr,"Alex Kerr has authored the best book I've read on contemporary Japan. I lived in Osaka from 1992-1994. Mr. Kerr's observations on everything from the arts and environment to business and education struck familiar chords. This book is excellent for foreign nationals currently living in Japan, and for anyone who's ever lived there. The book was originally written for a Japanese audience so some points may be lost on readers who've never made the trip. However, if you're planning to go to Japan and want to learn about more than cultural stereotypes, Lost Japan is your ticket."
5,unique & revelatory,"This book is more or less a collection of loosely connected essays about Japan and its culture based on the author's own experiences living in Japan as an art collector and business person. Having lived in Japan for several years myself, I found the book extremely interesting and full of insight. You won't run into too many expatriates who have hung around backstage at kabuki, restored a Japanese thatched-roof farmhouse, became an asian art collector, lived on the precincts of a temple as well as took part in the heady bubble-era as a business person. I feel grateful that these unique experiences were written down for all to see."
4,A reasonable synopsis of life in present Japan,"Lost Japan consists of a number of well-written essays on the current situation in Japan. Although the book's major emphasis is on the arts, it includes in passing a number of accurate observations on everyday life. It is the best book I've found to date to explain to relatives and friends what it is like here."
4,"Ganesh, Remover of Obstacles","This is a lovely albeit sad, novel about relationships and culture. The storyline meanders somewhat, however, that is probably necessary as it is telling two stories in parallel - the story of Krishna, a young India women who dears to o against the mores of her culture and community, and the story of her daughter, Sushi who struggles to find her own path as she learns her mother's carefully guarded secrets. The book is a celebration of mothers and daughters and gives an exc3llant understanding of the importance of traditional dance in the Indian culture."
5,Love this book!,"I gave this book to my daughter-in-law, who is an English teacher. The paintings are beautiful and the story touching. It's not just for children!"
4,Good reading for a colonial vacation,"I acquired this book while on vacation at Kiawah Island, SC. If you fancy yourself an amateur historian, this is the book for you. Prof. Weir provides a detailed review of the formation of South Carolina and its growth from proprietary colony to royal colony to free state. He blends social, economic and political history with fascinating tidbits about the geography around you. It is a little heavy on the political aspects, however, and sometimes my mind glazed over with governor-this and who owned what. But all in all, I quite enjoyed reading it as I toured the area. One of the most interesting parts was the extensive information he included about the interactions between the colonists and the native American populations which they ultimately destroyed or enslaved."
1,I want the last 2 hours of my life back!,This movie is atrocious! The acting is horrible and unbelievable! This movie will make u want to drink after being subjected to this piece of garbage for 2 hrs!
5,This is one of the best movies that was ever made!!,"This is a really great movie because it shows that it is not always the man that get a problem with alcohol in a relationship, it happens to women too. Meg Ryan did a great job in perfoming her role and Andy Garcia did a good job too. This movie shows the struggle that a family must go though to over come a battle with an alcoholic parent."
4,More Relevant Than Ever,"I never remembered the little girl who would grow up to be ""Deb"" in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" turned in one of the finest performances from any child actor ever. The adults are usually subtle and effective as well. Minus one star for the somewhat contrived separation (would a caring man like this abandon his daughters at the most fragile moment of their lives?) and the slightly cliched speeches each makes at al-anon, but the basic structure is extremely lifelike."
2,Not entertaining,"Even though Meg Ryan does an excellent and credible job, I thought Andy Garcia was a dud. First let me say that if you cannot relate to a rehab situation, this film is uncomfortable to watch. Most dissapointing was that I did not believe that the speech Andy Garcia's character gave at the end (that made Meg Ryan's character as his wife apparently return to him) had any substance to convince Meg that he really ""got it"" in terms of her struggle. The scene at the marriage counselor had some promise but then it ended too soon and was not revisited. Again that scene was great for Meg's character but did not do much for sphinx-face Andy. Also, supporting characters, aside from a few short moments at the rehab center were weak and uninteresting. Bottom line, if you come from a sober family, don't bother watching this flick."
5,168 Lives!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was an outstanding book written by Jayna Davis who I have contacted once by e-mail. I never believed McVeigh and Nichols were the masterminds. Bill Clinton and Janet Reno let many terrorists who took 168 lives, escape justice. If the government would have captured each and every terrorist responsible for, at the time, the largest terrorist attack on American soil, the Twin Towers would probably be still standing today."
4,The best spanish artist,2 years ago I was in the concert and I enjoyed very much¡¡ I bought the video and I remember this day forever.He is very friendly and talented artist. I hope go to the next concert very soon in Spain ¡¡¡
1,Waste of time,"I am a voracious reader of historical fiction as a conquence seldom remember title or authors names. I will remember Ms Young's so that I do not ever read her again. The book drags, discriptions are tedious and it is overly violent with graphic descriptions. Thankfully, I got this book from a public library. I stopped at page 72 of a 475 page book."
3,Just OK,"I've been on a Crusades binge for several months, reading quite alot about this period. I read mostly non-fiction, but like to pick up the eyecatching novels, as well.I saw Brethren and the 2nd in the series at the library, and thought this could be a good one. Unfortunately, the story didn't really do it for me. It was OK and had its moments, but overall too much sap and not enough Templar v Saracen intrigue. Seemed to me that Ms Young was more interested in telling a story about trust lost and love out of reach. That's fine, but not what I'm looking for. The Anima Templi storyline was a decent idea, even if just a knock off of others' Priory of Sion threads. Brethren, though, seemed to give us only the set-up for the following books.3 stars for some good sequences in an otherwise ploddingly-paced story and good historical context, but I've already decided against the sequels."
5,Nice Hitch,I purchased a few of these for Christmas gifts. I have a lot of Harley lovers in my family. They are nice looking and make a great gift.
5,Rock Solid,"Well worth the online price. I installed mine with a locking pin, as my previous hitch plate cover was stolen."
5,Homesick for Originality,"This CD is full of vitality, originality, and poetry. The band is a favorite of New Yorkers who have followed its development into a lyrical and melodic powerhouse. Listen carefully to ""Oh, How You Shine,"" a song meaningful in the deep recesses of any heart that has suffered loss. ""Unison"" is a comforting and compelling title song. ""Drop Your Mask""is pure. These guys are something else - poets in a void. Treat yourself to the best of the next generation."
1,overrated dribble,"First clue that book is overrated is fact that one reviewer in these pages has filed 2 glowing reviews but failed to disclose that he is the author's ""significant other"", for lack of a better word. The other great review is from the publisher! What do these self congratulatory reviews contribute to the rest of us who might be tempted to then rush out and buy this pap?"
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I bought the CD in a music shop and wasn't able to have a look at the song list (it was hidden behind the outer packaging of the CD), thus I was quite uppset when I realized that the soundtrack only contains songs of one musician. it might be good music, but as far as i remember, the movie had to offer much more than this. the least one can except is song that appears throughout the whole movie sung by the boy and his mother, and which is finally performed by the boy and Hugh Grant himself on stage!"
5,Classic!,"Boy this is a classic! ordered this for christmas. Great acting, story line. Got this at a great price. love it!"
2,better movies than this one are out there,Anthony Hopkins as Stevens the butler constantly lets the profession of butler interfere with the living of life. The insular butler is not worthy of sympathy. Better go see an ostrich with its head in the sand. Only Hopkins and Thompson themselves garner attention in this huge yawner.
1,unsubscripe american baby magazine is not easy,"We received magazine with suprise. We have no baby and absolutely no need for it but dont' know how to unsubscripe it. There is no phone number on the magazine and website. The magazine website ""Customer Care"" link also doesn't work."
1,Please stop sending this,"I, too, am suddenly subscribed, but how? I didn't subscribe and now I'm on a baby mailing list and am receiving samples of Enfamil in the mail and countless baby mailings, all deemed for the recycling bin."
5,We love Perry,We like Perry Mason and are replacing our VCR version with digital quality DVDs. Product is as expected. Will likely buy rest of series as it comes available.
3,Not the best of the series.,"I am a big fan of Perry Mason, both the books and the TV show, and have enjoyed all of this DVD series so far, but of the four sets (From Season One, Vol 1, to Season Two, Vol 2.) this series of episodes are the weakest. The stories don't stand out, and the dialog in some of the episodes is flat and predictable. Not all of the episodes in the set are like this, but enough are that I wouldn't recommend buying this set in the series, unless you're attempting to collect the full series. To be fair, I would still take a bad Perry Mason episode over nearly anything on network TV right now."
5,Totally Great!,I really love this collection of old Perry Mason television shows. The quality of the dvd is great as well as the content.
3,Great series but why not the entire season?,This is a wonderful series as others have written but only getting one half of a season per release is REALLY BAD. If you buy all nine seasons one half at a time (for a total of 18) the full set is going to cost about $500. What a rip off.
4,"Buy for the DVD, if not for the CD","It would be difficult to recommend this disc without the DVD- finally, most of Stevie's music videos are out on DVD, including the rarely seen ""Scarlett"" version of ""Stand Back."" The commentaries are interesting for the most part, with amusing anecdotes spread throughout by Stevie. And the ""Making of Bella Donna"" segment is interesting as well. The CD itself, well it's hard to get too excited about another ""Greatest Hits"" collection. I mean, most everything here is already available on her previous ""Best of"" collections, Timespace and Enchanted. Plus, it's hard to imagine a ""Best of"" collection without either Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You or Beauty and the Beast. If you're a casual fan, I'd recommend Timespace over this collection any day, because that album features a better, more balanced selection."
3,Beauty and the Beast,"Where the hell is Beauty and the Beast? I love that song, it was included on Timespace, I wonder why it got the boot here!"
2,Only a Few Good Tracks,"The only good songs on here are ""Edge of 17,"" but only the original and not the live version at the end, and ""Leather and Lace."" That is a duet with Don Henly and is great. Most of the rest of these songs are live or redone some other way, and they just don't sound as good. The live version of ""Rhiannon"" was especially horrible."
3,Good cd but,I do like this cd but not fussed with the live tracks and the song selection.I think the previous greatest hits that was put out in 1990 with sometimes life is a bitch released as a single was much better. The only down fall with that compilation it was not remastered.Stevie has had some amazing songs through out the years even with Fleetwood mac but i am a little dissapointed with this cd.
3,Gypsy??,"Is there a reason ""Gypsy"" is missing frm this CD? That's one of my all-time fave Stevie songs....very disappointing!"
3,"good songs ,couple of poor renditions",i bought this for my daughter for christmas.i dont like greatest hits albums that have versions changed from original popular ones. it had a few live or changed versions.barely recognised landslide.i should have researched better.
3,Who knows? It's anyone's guess at this point.,"This book is better than ""The Great Bust Ahead"" by Dan Arnold in that it is more practical and less fatalistic and hyperbolic. And it is not based solely on demographics, but rather primarily on DEBT. That nasty four-letter word that got us into the mess we're in now, and it does not take a rocket scientist to predict that. You can't ride the crest of a wave forever--the boom of the '90s and early 2000s was simply unsustainable. Government debt, personal loans, student loans, mortgages, credit cards, we are one nation under debt. And the national debt is still rising at an unprecedented rate. That said, it is still too soon to say whether Brusse is right or wrong. This recession may very well turn into a depression, or maybe not. There are more safeguards now than in 1929, but there are still a few chinks in the armor that we count on to protect us. 13 years seems a bit too long however."
4,Decent Presentation For Those Unaware Of the Coming Crisis in The Financial Markets,I first came across this author when he was featured on the Financial Sense program. This author does do a decent job of presenting the potential blood bath that could occur because of the unregulated credit default swaps.
4,nice read,"This is my, second time writting this review, there is something weird about it not being posted. I find this book very nice and the comments on the blog on Amazon very interesting and responsible. For someone who tries to predicts the economic future, it is very bold of him to continue to defend his ideas. The posted comments were still blocked at 11.....why? Being a believer in any form of conspiracy i will keep asking ....why?"
2,Half Supposition- Half Regurgitated,"This is one of those situations where you can't believe that anybody rated this book higher than a 2. The first half of the book is simply a bunch of opinions and fears put out by the author without statistical support. The second half is just the same old ""how much do you need to save in order to retire"" discussion available in every investment and retirement book available. I was sorely disappointed because the author's premise seems very interesting. Unfortunately, the intellectual rigor necessary for this book to add something unique and interesting to the economic dialogue was just not invested."
1,Crap - Don't Order,"This order only comes with a very thin robe, yet shows a complete costume. The material is junk and I won't make the mistake again. I am returning this junk product."
2,So different from the picture!,"I am not one to write bad reviews but this robe was not at all like the picture shows. First, it has sleeves (which are pretty long but I understand this and tried to shorten them myself) and second, it does not tie at the neck. There was no way to secure it so it kept falling off. In hindsight I could have used a safety pin but I didn't. I ended up tying the sleeves around the neck so that it wouldn't fall off as he ran around trick or treating but it looked pretty bad."
2,Misleading Picture,"Well add my name to the list of people mislead by the photo on this product...it's only the brown robe. The picture on Amazon & the picture on the package both show a robe and a costume, but again: IT'S ONLY THE ROBE. Which is total BS. But hey, shame on me for falling for it without double checking the reviews. I was just happy to have (thought I had) found a Star Wars Jedi costume for under $30, which seems to be the norm for cheap earth tone colored fabric.Anyway, the robe is brown. It has a hood. It's thin, cheap material. My son seemed to like it ok. There you have it."
1,VERY DISAPOINTING,"The song""Boogaloo Party""is a mixed version of the 1964 song.A very poor remix,and the rest of the CD just gets worst.DON'T BUY THIS!"
5,A great new song,"I thought that ther first song ""All My Life"" was a beautiful song. Then K-ci and Jojo came out with ""Tell Me it's Real"" and I thought that that song was just as good!"
2,This really ain`t all that great in my opinion.,"Okay, first of all, Tell Me It`s Real is VERY annoying. When K-Ci and Jojo sing the chorus it makes me wanna cover my ears! They just belt it out like they`re Celine Dion or something. This song is a real disappointer to me, `cuz those two did such a beautiful job with All My Life. Where the hell did they go wrong? And for some reason, their voices sound different and not as good as when they sang All My Life. I can`t believe how every dang person in the U.S. can listen to this song and consider it one of the best they`ve heard. Maybe your eardrums are different from mine, I don`t know. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the story K-Ci and Jojo are trying to tell people about true love and deep emotions, like they did in All My Life. But unfortunately, that was blocked by bad melodies and a chorus that sounds like a mare in labor is singing it."
4,son favortie movie,the movie is a hit.my son loves it. showed up on time.with no complaines.will buy again from this company. this is a great kid movie
4,Who doesn't love this classic...,I bought this for my neice....really.... ;) I thoroughly enjoy this Disney classic...
5,Underrated Disney Masterpiece!,"What a terrific movie! I had forgotten how wonderful this movie was until we purchased it for our daughters. The music is stunning, and the voices are perfectly fit for the characters they serve. Especially noteworthy is Louis Prima as ""King Louie"". The score is beautiful as well, using much haunting alto flute playing. A masterpiece that deserves a place on everyone's video shelf!"
4,Stupid man cub.,I'm no fan of Mowgli when he's being disrespectful to his elders (Bagheera). But the animal kingom that comes together is astounding. My husband who will not watch Disney movies will sit down to enjoy King Loui.
5,Really Great,This product was shipped exactly how I expected it. This vendor really met my expectations as a shopper. I wasn't sure what to expect upon buying this product but I was not disappointed. Thanks.
3,Skips a lot,"I received the product in great condition and there are no visible scratches or problems, but the disk still has 3 major skips on it."
1,I love the movie but this DVD is seriously flawed,"I picked this DVD up today and got it home to find that Disney had altered the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to make the movie ""fit"" on widescreen TVs. They did this by chopping off the top and bottom of the image. This results in the loss of a good deal of character animation (at least the tops of their heads and their feet). Trust me, I own the original Limited Issue DVD of this film and I did a side-by-side comparison as soon as I got the new Platinum Edition home. If you are a purist about original aspect ratios, please avoid this release and petition Disney to start a free disc replacement program. We should at least have the option of watching the original unaltered film the way that it was meant to be seen.***NOTE: There are now user images that can be viewed for this product that illustrate the cropping discussed in my review."
4,Pleased,"I have always loved this movie. It is my favorite Disney. The only thing that would have made it better would have been some extras and the suposed suround sound. Of the 9 DVD's in the boxed set (that all state they have full color discs) 3 did not have ""full"" disc art including this one. I don't care if it is the same as the VHS, This one will not break as my VHS tape did and it is so much crisper in color and sound. If you don't have it, get it. Hopefully they will not reissue this in a new ""gold"" edition ala Pinnochio."
3,Great study guide,Highly recommend for study of Paul's writings. We used it to supplement a class and were very happy with it.
3,Banking on Heaven,This was a very interesting DVD. What it lacked in polish was made up for in content. I have read extensively on this topic and still learned some things. I will share it with others.
3,"Great singing, odd dancing","I purchased this DVD based on my interest in Baroque music and having seen on TV some of Mark Morris's interpretations of Handel, which were wonderful. However in this case, I found the choreography odd and and awkward. I am not an expert in dance and probably don't understand what Morris was trying to accomplish, but this intrepretation didn't connect with me at all. On the other hand, I thought the singing was terrific."
1,Doesn't work with Enegizers own batteries!!,We bought this thinking it would work with ANY rechargeable batteries. It says on there that it MIGHT not work unless it's xbox360 rechargeable or Energizer rechargeable batteries. So we bought the Energizer batteries and they don't EVEN work! It took us 10 tries and a lot of time googling reviews before we realized we probably need to buy xbox360 rechargable batteries. At this point it is so not worth it! Ugh!
5,"a look at Smashing Pumpkins, not THE smashing pumpkins","I love this video because it shows 'old school pumpkins' when they first became popular, when they were just discovering what it was like to be in a successful rock band and before they changed their name to THE smashing pumpkins. There are so many awesome live footages from their siamese dream tour and ... which show the band's weird sense of humor. If you like them at all, you should buy this."
4,My son loves it more than I do!!,"My son is 8 months old and loves this toy! He will sit on the floor and play with this toy for over a half hour! I will have to say, though, he likes it more than I do!!! First, the toy plays a variety of songs, however, at times it will play the same song over and over again....AHHHH! Second, the tubes on this toy are easy for my son to grasp, but he likes to reach for the inside tubes and therefore gets his arm caught in the toy every time he plays with it. He doesn't seem to mind this, but it is nerve-wrecking for me!!! Those seem to be the only complaints I have about this toy, but like I said, my son really enjoys it! :)"
3,Symphony Star Beads,"I have an 11 month old that plays with this toy. My only concern with this toy is he gets his leg caught inbetween the colorful plastic that holds the beads on. He has done this several times, and each time it is difficult to get the toy off his leg without causing him alarm."
3,A little disappointed but still good,"Still a good CD but I was certainly hoping for more in the way of Disco Volante. This beach music sound is certainly different, but I was expecting something a bit edgier. I probably need to hear it a few more times but as of now, it is not my favorite of the 3."
1,just not feelin it,"I just cant see the whole Mike Patton thing,I mean yeah hes a great vocalist and i CERTAINLY THINK HIS BEST WORK IS BEHIND HIM. Faith No More had a COUPLE of good albums,and im not talking about Epic, but drivel is drivel is drivel. Maybe I have been spoiled by some real cutting edge music,or some of the vastly talented bands that metal has to offer,even on the progressive side. I'm sorry guys,this stuff to me while interesting,is just a complete cacaphony of noise. Perhaps Mike Patton should get together with another vocal icon who has long since run out of gas,Axl Rose,and can do some 50's doo-wop and perhaps some ballroom standards. Now THATS cutting edge."
1,Just didn't get it,"I liked Faith No More.. I liked Fantomas.. and Tomahawk was pretty good when I saw them open up for Tool, but Mr. Bungle I am not impressed with. I did not like this CD. Sure it's experimental, but it doesn't sound very good. Could not find one memorable or listenable thing about this album, thus making this a drab and torturous musical experience."
5,I HAVE NO CONNECTIONS!,"I HAVEN'T GOT ANY CONNECTIONS, BUT I'VE HEARD BITS OF THE SONGS THROUGH THE INTERNET. NEVERTHELESS, BUNGLE IS THE GREATEST BAND EVER AND EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM."
4,very enjoyable,"People who never heard Gong and their 'pataphysical' music in the '60, unfamiliar with the early albums by Todd Rundgren and something from Zappa will find much novelty and a fresh approach to arrangement and composition here. Nothin' really new, but all funny and well done. Buy this cd; but if you like it, try also the old stuff above mentioned or John Zorn (not for the faint-hearted)"
5,None of them knew they were robots,"This CD is FAN-Frickin-TASTIC!""None of them knew they were robots"" could have perfectly been the opening song for David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. It is a weird 50's style rock & roll song that all of the sudden is sung in latin. (??) Yeah, that's just one song.You have to get this CD!! Check the video posted on YouTube of Pink Cigarrete. That was exactly what I was envisioning this song was about! Pure madness but extremely well done and pure genius!"
3,Collaboration from your bookshelf,"I'm a avid reader of O'Reily Publications. The majority of their books provide a thorough and complete explanation and examples of how to and why you are doing something. This book gave a very general touch of the major aspects of the Common Gateway Interface. However, the book assumes that you have a solid understanding of Perl and suggests that you look at other books for deeper understanding of the programming concepts. A newbie at Perl will find themselves making constant trips to his bookshelf to look something up to make sense out of what the book is saying. So all in all the title is a bit missleading as this book is really more about concepts in CGI mixed with some simple examples, but fails on really covering the ""programming"" part of it."
2,Feh.,The earlier reviewer is right--there are many factual errors in this book; so many that it becomes merely a collection of opinion pieces. Frequently the author digresses so far from his stated subject--the essay on I Spy hardly says anything about I Spy--that you wonder if he even remembers what the subject is. The book is pretty much a waste of time.
2,Who is Jimmy McGarrett of Hawaii 5-0?,"In one point the author refers to Jack Lord's character of Hawaii 5-0 whose name was actually Steve McGarrett as Jimmy McGarrett! Also, the author writes of Barretta as if it was after Starsky and Hutch. But Barretta actaully debuted before Starsky and Hutch did--no?"
3,not as advertised-black and white- no subtitles,I paid highly for this version thinking it was in color and had subtitles wrong!Movie itself was interesting. It has been mentioned as a predecessor of Sin Nombre. Just go see Sin Nombre!
5,The best of Mexican cinema,"This realistic look at life in Mexico City in the 1950's is a masterpiece by film maker Luis Bunuel. I am happy to see it offered by Amazon as I can now own a copy (I have previously watched a copy from the Phoenix, Arizona library)."
2,Very Average,I was Looking Foreward to this Disc but after Hearing it Nothing Special too say.I was Hoping For More of His BeatBoxing as opposed to His Rapping.it Doesn't hit at all.A cut Here&there but Nothing worth Seeking.
2,"All the anticipation, so much disappointment","After being delayed for nearly two months, I was happy as hell when I finanlly saw Make the Music 2000 was out. But, all that happiness faded when I pressed play. There is a suprising lack of the vocal gymnastics of which Rahzel is capable, and while there are 2 or 3 good tracks, the hidden track being the best, the majority of the ablum has too much of Rahzel's not yet pollished rap stylings, and not enough of his human beatboxing that has made him a force in hip-hop music. Overall a huge disappointment."
4,"Cute, but not necessary","These go perfectly with the Zanzibar crib set and are great for tying the nursery together, but they are not a ""must have"" item. They are lightweight and can be hung with the 3M adhesive hooks in order to avoid damaging your carefully painted nursery walls."
4,Awesome Rollers Set,Excellent product. Thus far I've only used the the ionic feature. This feature produced way more steam.I have 4a4b natural coily hair. Of course I straighten my hair first. These rollers worked magic!!! Loooooove. I will definitely use again.
1,No dual voltage,"I bought the C97958 Ionic Steam Hairsetter recently because on product description it is stated ""The only patented steam hair setting sytem with worldwide dual voltage"" and I wanted to use it abroad. However on the device I received there is no switch to change the voltage setting. The operating instructions also states ""OPERATES ONLY AT 120V, 60Hz"". The worldwide dual voltage claim appears to be misleading and totally untrue!"
4,Caruso Professional ION Steam Hairsetter,"Steam hairsetters are great for making smooth, shiny curls in my wavy and somewhat frizzy hair. I love this one because it has 30 rollers in 5 different sizes and you can buy more of any size you want. I think that the jumbo rollers are the largest-sized rollers of any steam hairsetter on the market.The covers that hold on the rollers don't work too well, though. They leave a dent in your curl and sometimes the roller slips. I solved that by using some of those spring loaded ponytail clips instead of the roller covers."
3,It's okay,"I've tried to use this product a couple times with 'okay' outcomes. In terms of likes, the product is easy to use and it doesn't take long to apply the rollers or for the steam to curl my hair. I also like that it doesn't fry the hair like some other products might.In terms of dislikes, I felt that the plastic guards left unsightly dents in my hair, the curls that it produces on my hair are not as smooth and lovely as I would have hoped, and I found it difficult to get my thick, somewhat frizzy and wavy hair to wrap around the curler. I think the product works best when I thoroughly blowdry my hair straight and then apply for waves. I guess I had hoped that this would be a little more of a miracle product but of course it isn't. It's gone into the cabinet and I'm sure I'll use it once in awhile but not as often as I hoped."
3,Is this normal??,"I just received my hair steamer today... I am sure I putted water, everything was fine, but when I turned on to Ironic steam, it had the ""Bi bi bi"" sound non-stop! But when I switched to steam, it doesn't has it... Is this condition normal?? Also, there are few cracks on the gray cover when I received it..."
1,Not for my hair,"This might work for some, but not my hair. I have thick hair that holds onto moisture (shoulder length that takes 1 hour to blow dry) and the rollers left my locks a complete mess. No curls, no shine-just a frizzy mess. I experimented with the amount of time I left the rollers on the steamer, but nothing worked for me. I was hoping that these would work because I am concerned about heat and damage, but returned these and bought the BaByliss Professional 30 Nano Titanium Hairsetter Roller Set."
5,Couldn't be happier!,"I have very thick and very long hair, I use all the jumbo large sized rollers and I'm left with beautiful thick enviable waves that last a few days. I was so sick of using a curling iron that I ordered these on a whim and I'm so glad I did! Will definitely recommend to others."
1,faulty ion steamer,"I bought this Caruso Ion through Amazon and the first time I used it on regular setting. and it was fine. The first time I tried to use it on the ion setting, it just wouldn't work and I cannot even get the regular setting to work after I tried the ion setting. So I have it setting in my drawer with the other 2 sets of rollers from the two previous Caruso I had. I now have 3 sets of rollers. MY other two machines at lasted about 2 years each. Now I have a drawer full of Caruso rollers, but not a machine that works. I look at it every once in awhile so I can remind myself to never buy another one"
4,Fast and effective,I purchased the Ion steam hairsetter after reading all the reviews. Love the product! My hair is curly in a few short minutes. I only have one complaint - the foam on the rollers tend to wear out quickly. I wish they sold foam replacements!
5,Preserve History,"Get a copy or two for history's sake before all is re-written and it's all sunshine, roses, honey and milk. Go to YouTube and watch the clips. History will repeat itself if we don't read and preserve it for the younger generations."
4,Galileo's Daughter is Light on the Daughter,"Suor Maria Celeste provides a great supporting role in Sobel's book as Galileo battles the Church and himself in a struggle regarding what is Truth. Unfortunately, not enough of Galileo's daughter is revealed to warrant the book's title Galileo's Daughter.Sobel uses letters and parts of letters Celeste had written to her father throughout the book to underline how supportive she was of him whilst the Church pronounced him a heretic. Although the book should have been comprised of letters Galileo had written to her daughter, this, sadly, is an impossibility. The only remnants containing information on his private life is a mere 124 letters from Celeste."
5,"Finally, the *facts* about Galileo!","It is amazing the amount of misinformation that is floating aboutunder the guise of factual accounts of the life of Galileo. Thiswonderful, unabridged audiobook weaves Galileo's extant letterswith historical narrative. All of the ""holes"" are patched; all ofthe evil deeds performed by the Catholic church against him areitemized and explained; and the true man comes to life throughhis remarkable correspondence with his oldest daughter andothers. Although I also own the hardback version, I prefer theaudiobook because the narration is so good, and it makes foran excellent listen while on the road."
2,Just didn't interest me,"Somehow, this book just was not as compelling or interesting as Sobel's terriffic ""Longitude."" Probably this is because of the letter format, which is distancing and rather off-putting."
5,Safe and secure,"The i1030 is for someone wanting to keep their iPod safe and secure from bumps, scrapes and drops. You cannot listen to the ipod while the i1030 is closed. However, it works as a nice holding device on an airplane for example where you can also store your earplugs and camera uploading cords. I used it open on the airplane with the ipod nicely perched inside where you can easily see the screen if necessary. I wasn't as paranoid about taking my iPod out of it's speaker dock at home and carrying half way 'round the country as I usually would've been without this great ""suit case"" for your sounds and movies."
5,Great Product for any Cyberpunk Fan,"I have to agree that although the system might not be as detailed as it was in 3rd edition, this new edition that WizKids has released is way simpler for any GM to run a very fun game without being bogged down with a complex system.The character creation system is very balanced and gives players the ability to customize their characters better."
4,Warm and cute,It may not have the greatest rhymes but it relates well to the familiar activities of children and catches their attention.
2,Not as good as the first,"I was disapointed with the lastest Queer as folk CD. Definatley not as good as the first CD that came out last year. I only like 2 songs on this CD. Plenty and Underwater, but the rest of the CD is very gay anthemish. The tired music you hear in the bars over and over that have the same beat to it. Not worth the money."
3,More dance than season one-but still only one disc,"Progressing towards what it would eventually be on season 3, volume two segues strictly dance songs together, but it's still only one disc of music like volume 1. Season 3 would break out with an all out club feel on disc 1 with all long versions of club hits-and eventually, the Club Bablyon disc would go with 2 discs worth of it. Great dance tracks here, but track times are too short, and the disc doesn't utilize a full 20 minutes of disc space! It would have been amazing to have longer versions of hard to get diva anthems like Rising, one of the strongest songs on here. Track times:1. hide U (5:07)2. Absolutely not (4:46)3. everyday (4:38)4. caught up (4:24)5. Rising (4:23)6. Sneaky one (4:14)7. Harder better faster stronger (4:59)8. Star guitar (5:00)9. Miss you (5:02)10. Plenty (5:04)11. Underwater (4:59)12. Beautiful (5:07)"
1,v3m?,"its says its for v3m motorola but it doesnt list a v3m anywhere for you to select from the list of phones, so i cant import my own music only gives me samples, even with the updates. i dont understand why not, i guess i'll try again for the fourth time."
1,Failed.,"Don't get me wrong, I think this ring is absolutely beautiful-- from the differentiation of the blue pearls to the detailed crafting in the silver. If it weren't for the fact that a pearl fell out within less than a month of purchasing it, I would've rated this ring a 5/5.However, as it stands, I probably won't be buying anything else from Dahlia."
1,ring,I bought the ring for my 16 yr old granddaughter for xmas. It is Jan8 and already 4 small pearls have fallen off of it. I am contacting the company and hoping they will refund or change the ring to one that does not fall apart.
2,Mr. Lucky is Simply Boring,"While the book starts off interesting and certainly from a non-gamblers point of view the scams are really cool, the book just doesn't do it. I got about 1/2 way through and then started to struggle - does it pay to finish this one or ""give it up""?Truth be known I should have called it quits. With the exception of understanding how the scams worked, it's just gets really boring.So, sorry to those who loved it, it just doesn't stand in the same league as the great mystery writers.I has previously read Midnight Rambler, liked it a lot, and based on that book, decided to read more of Swain's work; but this one's a stinker."
3,"Stardust, but not quite stardust","First of all, let me say I absolutely love Hoagy Carmichael's music. He's one of the greatest American song writers. But, I was disappointed on a few of the tracks. I wanted a CD for driving and I got it for my trip to New Orleans. I wanted to hear Hoagy sing the songs he wrote. Instead, he played his piano and riffed on the melody on some of the songs. Some he sang on. Not bad, but I did want that voice in the car as I drove. Otherwise, it's a good album, just not great. Stardust is probably my favorite song of all time (when Cole Porter's Begin the Beguine doesn't nudge it out of first place) and I wanted to hear Hoagy sing it. There are two songs that have never been done badly, no matter who records them--Stardust and Amazing Grace. Just perfect melodies. And I'm a big fan of Willie Nelson's version of Stardust, he just knocks me out when he sings it. I really, really wanted to hear Hoagy sing it."
5,Tissue Paper Flowers,Made a wonderful and fun gift for our neighbor girl! She has had lots of fun making flowers!!
5,Exactly as expected: awesome,"It's maintained the grit, cleans easy, and has a wonderful sharp tip. I know some folk aren't as keen on that last point, but I like it. My nails have never been happier. I can address every little snag immediately with far smoother results and less loss of nail. Not sure what else to say!For the record: I am SO glad that I found the recommendations for this, after my terribly friggin' pointless experience with the Revlon ""crystal nail file."" The worst part is that this awesome OPI file was CHEAPER than the Revlon crap. *sigh*"
3,"Some good, some bad","The file worked VERY well at first but after two uses it lost a lot of its' abrasive nature, taking more than twice as long to work on my nails.To be fair, the degradation of the abrasive did not continue, I do not have a lot of patience for grooming my nails (it is a necessary evil) and I have extremely hard nails but I did not feel that it was worth the money.It broke through carelessness (put it into a pocket) and am hoping that a ceramic will hold its' qualities longer."
1,Snapped into two pieces with minimal pressure,"I used this fairly expensive file about a half-dozen times before it snapped into two as I applied a minimal amount of pressure on it. I was also unimpressed with the abrasiveness of the surface, and found the file to be too thick to use as a pick, despite its shape. What a waste of money."
5,Good jeans.,I got them at Amazon.com few days ago. It is a great looking jeans and they look great with both black and brown boots and sneakers as well. The size and lenth are right and the item arrived as promised in 2 days. Highly recommend.
2,"Cheesy B-movie, total MST3K win!","I love the Snow White tale, but this was just ridiculous. We started out with high hopes, but they were quickly dashed. The CG was HORRIBLY cheap, the makeup was almost as bad. My husband and I ended up laughing our butts off by the end of the movie because we turned it into a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie, by adding our own lines, singing our own songs, etc. AND honestly the plot is so thin and the acting so questionable, it really appears to be a bad x-rated movie without the dirty parts.Not a good buy if you want to enjoy a movie about Snow White. Totally a good buy if you like B-movies and you want to poke fun at it all night. Enjoy!"
2,slow strange disappointing and low budget,The trailer was better than the film. Could have been better with a better script and more money for decent CGI. It had the equivalent of video game graphics. I feel sorry for the actors. They did the best they could with the lines they were given. I'd classify it as a B or high C movie based on script and graphics.
4,Computer Maintenance,This book is several years old but I still found it very helpful. I like the author's style. Its easy to navigate and find solutions to most problems.
1,Horrible.,"All they did was white out some of the writing,not even all of it.Crappy book I regret purchasing this one."
1,Ancient and Used,"This book was full of writting, and it's a book full of practice tests. Its also 14 years old so not at all up to date with the current AP exam."
2,Too Long...,The photography and the editing were great and considering that this is a lo-no budget movie the director is to be commended. But the big problem I had is that you just can't follow the story. It runs about 40 minutes to long and it looses focus going from one meaningless scene to the next. I tried to watch the whole movie three times but just got frustrated and turned it off because there seemed to be no end in sight. If your a fan of independent lo budget movies it's worth checking out because it has a lot going for it. I just wish the movie was shorter and the story was tighter.
5,New country fan in Louisiana,"I bought Michael Peterson first CD and fell in love with country music. Now thats all I listen to. Michael second CD ""Being Human"" is one of the best I've heard. If I had to pick one number it would be very hard, there's not on cut on this CD that I would skip over, but my favorite is ""Two of the Lucky Ones"". If people would listen to these beautiful words, they would fall in love all over again. Michael has a way of showing you through his songs a way to his heart. If you buy any CD in the future I recommend this one, it is the best."
3,Im not sure it works right,"It seems simple enough that i just plug the cable into my usb port and then my clie (peg-nr70r) but it doesnt seem to charge or recognise it, im starting to get a little upset but im thinking i may need software to instal. can anyone please help me out i would greatly appreciate it email is adidssocer@aol.com"
2,Overrated book,"I ... was disappointed to find such poorly written material. With every turn of the page I expected it to pick up and smooth out, but it never did. It's in need of serious editing. While some dialoque is quite good, overall it is too inconsistent in quality. It's too bad editors don't help their writers like they used to. This could be a promising writer with some help."
3,For Home Theatre Lovers Only,"This behemoth (weighs around 80 Lbs.) will certainly provide more than enough bass for most home theatre systems, all the way down to 20 hertz...bass you can not only hear but FEEL..the video contour button and front volume control are a nice touch.However, this is not the most musical of subwoofers as it takes sophisticated electronics (servo control) to keep a 15 inch driver from distorting and enable it to provide quick, tight, punchy bassIf you will be using it for mostly music, I would recommend a smaller 10"" sub that can provide a better reproduction of that all important mid and highs.But if home theatre is your game and you have a large room to fill (20'x15'), this sub is a great place to start."
1,Great till it stopped working,"I have had this unit since 2001. However, but it stopped working in 2004. The amp started a loud popping noise after being on for less than 5 minutes.Mind you, that we only used it occasionally and never very loud as it could rattle pictures off the wall.I've looked around for a replacement plate amp but never got one.I'm working on wiring it so I can by-pass the amp and run it off the sub output of my AV Amp...but I will use an old Yamaha Receiver, with the left and right output bridged, as the power for the D115.BTW:Somewhere I once read the following:""The 10"" will annoy your neighbors...with the 15"", they'll call the cops.""Anyway, that convinced me to buy it. When it worked, it was great!"
3,Not bad,"I purchased this because I could not find white lights with white wire in any of the stores. The only complaint I have is that the bulbs are not removeable, so they cannot be replaced when they go out. However, this is the second year I've used them and, so far, there are no burnouts."
5,24 beautiful tracks by the lovely Dinah Shore....,"These are Dinah's early sides, and feature her with some big bands and strings. Shore had a special way with a jazz standard, and especially with a torch song. Dinah Shore could easily be considered a jazz singer on some of these tracks, which makes this great disc of interest to jazz vocal collectors."
4,Not just for warts,"I initially bought this for getting rid of skin tags. After three treatments on the same one, it's still there, although it does look a bit smaller.What it DID work on was a seborrheic keratosis on my shoulder. Again, it took three separate treatments, but I'm happy to say that it finally fell off the other day and the skin around it is mildly red but doesn't look scarred...i.e. I think it will heal up just fine.As the first person stated, it does sting a bit, and I would recommend having someone else do the freezing if you're not into inflicting unpleasant sensations upon yourself, or if the spot you want to freeze is in an awkward place."
1,"Don't waste your money on this product, it doesn't work.","I have given this product more than one chance (I've bought it twice now, and there are 12 freeze sticks in each pack!) but it just hasn't worked for me. I have multiple warts on my hands and have tried everything under the sun, but this is not something that works. Don't waste your money! Upon first use, I felt a slight burning on the wart as I held it for the allotted amount of time required and then it turned white. I bandaged it up and the next day it was slightly smaller but definitely did not make ANY difference within a few days. The directions specifically say to use the product in spaced out intervals so I'm not sure how it could have been successful.I would instead recommend Apple Cider Vinegar or even Dr. Scholl's liquid wart remover, both are so much more effective and much less expensive!"
5,Metal where the sun don't shine!! Grrrrrrrrrrreat!!!!!!,"Never have I seen a band improve like this. An absolute Masterpiece of Metal.For fans who love their metal with multiple rhythm changes multiple solos great vocals all done with style power and beauty,buy it !!!!Best Metal Album In Years!!!!"
5,beautiful,As a harmonica player myself and a Christian any music that honers my Lord is more than worth it.
3,You are so close...,"This band put out a great album called Souls for Sale. This album is too routine and not as loud as SFS. There's more of the country blues sound on that previous release. I think Grohl was too much of an influence on the sound of this record, and I love Nirvana and Foo Fighters. Pass on this release and get Souls for Sale."
2,So-so,"This was one of four required texts for my graduate literacy course.. of all the required readings, I used this one the least. Although a quick and easy read, not very useful in the classroom or as a referencing source for writing papers."
5,3 seasons of pure seinfeld classics and then some...........,"this cost me a few xmas gifts for others, but i could not resist(and i really tried) from purchasing these hours upon hours of classic seinfeld! only viewing a tv showing here and there, i fell totally in love with the show! now, at last, i will be able to view over 40 episodes, plus such a bounty of extras, it will take a few weeks to go thru every thing included in this superlative package! the hi definition transfers are awesome-the sound is not! no matter, to finally own this classic package is pure enjoyment. laughs galore is an understatement! i cannot wait till spring for the next set, culminating next november with the concluding seasons. rest assured, i will stash the cash to own the entire complete seasons all on dvd. yada yada yada, this writer is totally thrilled and excited. bravos and kudos to everyone involved to bring this painstaking package of fun, laughs, and love to dvd."
5,HAPPY FESTIVUS!!!!!!!!!!,"Seinfeld is coming out to DVD, i can hardly wait for Nov 23. This should be the greatest dvd of the year!!!!"
5,Doesn't Get Better Than Carnival of Rust!,"I absolutely love Poets of the Fall, and this CD is really, really good. Carnival of Rust is fantastic--both the song and the music video!"
4,Fine fit for Jeep Grand Cherokee,"Although not specifically recommended for my 08 Jeep Grand Cherokee, these are a fine, secure, attractive fit. The adjust easily and hold the adjustment over long road trips. They provide good rear visibility when towing my 24' Airstream."
1,wrong,this was the wrong item did not go with what i already had. hohjfda dgjdsifjgda ghjaeroiuahga nfgajwehfiuwaes gbakjdh iuhgi hu
4,Time To Discover Thomas,"Ross Thomas's THE COLD WAR SWAP is a good introduction to one of the better and often overlooked thriller writers. Grab a handful of his novels (Briarpatch, Ah Treachery, etc.)and you'll come away liking his style, wit, and sense of story structure better than much of what is out there today.THE COLD WAR SWAP is a look into a period most readers won't remember (post War Germany) which also makes it 'new.' I don't think this one represents his best but it's enough for you to add his name to your reading list. By the time you get through several of his books you'll wonder why you haven't read him sooner.I'm glad to see the books are being re-released."
4,Acker Bilk-always good,"This album has several of the oldies that I like, plus it is one of several Acker Bilk albums I have and like them all."
5,steam rollers,I love the steam rollers. I have been using caruso steam rollers for quite a few years. The steam doesn't harm my hair like curling irons.
3,"Good, see newer Sassoon models",This was a good purchase - units are fast and very energyefficient. Different from units that heat the whole holder atonce. Does individual curlers. Girl friend loves em.Beware that hard water buildup kills these and you'll be buyinga new one about every 6 months (at least in my area).Search for the Vidal Sassoon newer model to save a few bucks!9/22/2007
1,Caruso Pro Traveler 14 Molecular Hairsetter - BUYER BEWARE!,"I owned an earlier model of this hairsetter for years before it finally gave out. I was VERY PLEASED!In spite of the less-than-glowing reviews I was reading about the current model, I was willing to give it a shot, because steam hairsetters do a much better job on my thick, but fine hair. The only other model I could find got bad reviews, too.Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that I only used this hairsetter an average of 3 or 4 times a month, it crapped out in only 9 months! If I had used it every day, it wouldn't have lasted much more than a month!What's worse is that it apparently has NO WARRANTY!!!I must say that I am shocked that people are rating this product with 4 or 5 stars, while admitting they need to replace it often. Have our standards dropped so much that we don't care if a product will last??? Especially one without a warranty? Does anyone think that's why they don't offer one???"
3,steam rollers,"So this morning I tried out my new Caruso steam rollers. I pinned the top of my hair, as it is shorter and did the long section first. I used to jumbo rollers and large rollers on the bottom and the medium rollers on the top layer. I have fine hair but it is pretty thick. I left each roller on the steam for about 6 seconds. I left the rollers in while I went to make a sandwich (about 15 minutes because I was cooking bacon too), then I went back and took them out. My hair came out a bit wavy- that's all. It looks nice but I expected that it would have a lot more curl to it. I will try again, this time, leaving the roller on the steam a bit longer and update soon."
3,ok,"I bought this based on positive reviews and personally find it ""ok."" I can not believe that other ppl claim the curls last for a couple days! unimaginable! I will say if you leave it in for any more than 15 minutes, you will come out with a head ball of curls (and not very stylish!). No worries, as the curls die out in a couple hours and relaxes to a very soft wave. I like this alternative to heated rollers bc it seems less damaging to your hair and at least for me, the results are basically the same (curls only hold for 3-4 hrs), so I chose to keep this set over traditional heated rollers."
1,Dissapointed,Did not work on my hair at all...I have very long blonde hair! The ends were frizzy and the curl went out of my hair with in minutes!
5,Wonderful curls,This is my second set of Caruso Curlers and I love them. They work very quickly and give you long lasting strong curls. When I remove the rollers I just leave the hair in place for a few minutes before fixing to give the curls time to cool completely and set.
5,A great product,"I've had one for years. The steaming unit quit so I had to have another one. I have plenty of rollers and didn't really need another set of rollers, but they come with the unit."
2,Doesn't curl hair much,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter, thinking it would be effective, but safe for her long, thick hair. Even though I have been doing the rolling (since I thought it would work better if the rollers were placed properly, steamed appropriately, not much hair in each, etc.), the curls are pretty disappointing. Nothing like the photographs of girls with long flowing hair with gentle curls. These usually fall out pretty quickly, and don't ever brush them or they are completely gone. Would not recommend for thick hair - maybe okay for thin hair."
5,Curly haired girl,"My hair is straight and nothing I did would keep the curl in for very long. I've used regular sponge curlers, hot curlers, and a curling iron. Where I live is humid and the curl would disappear within the first 30 minutes after using these other methods. My daughter bought the Caruso steam curlers as a Christmas gift. It was the best gift I receieved. I love these curlers and the machine! It takes up very little space on my counter. Every time I use it my curls stay in all day long and into the night. When I wake up the next morning, my hair still has some of the curl left. This machine is amazing! I don't know how this works.....but it works. I'm happy and my husband is happy. He loves me with curly hair. If you want curls in your hair, then I highly recommend you buy this product. You will not be sorry."
3,not really sure yet,"I am not really sure about this product. The curl just does not stay. I do use a flat iron, so my hair is smooth, then put the rollers in. It doesn't stay as smooth with the rollers, possibly due to the steam, but I know it is better for my hair than dry heat. Maybe I need to try it without using the flat iron first. It sure heats up fast though and is very easy to use."
5,Great hairsetter,"I have used the Caruso Hairsetter for years. The first one I had bought, you had to use salt in it. I like it because it is kind to your hair because no heat is used as with other hairsetters. However, I have found out that the new ones do not last as long as the earlier ones with salt. I do not use it every day and I think it should last longer than it does. I just purchased my second one from Amazon and the first one did not last more than a year. Great product and if anything happens to this one, I will purchase another one. In fact, I should keep an extra one on hand in case the one fails to work."
5,Best steam curler setter ever!,"I am so pleased with this Caruso hairsetter system, i would recommend it to anyone with thin, polka straight hair like me. SOOOOOOOOOO easy to use. Put one curler on the setter for 5 seconds while your curling one a new curler is heating up on the setter. I do my light makeup routine and whe Im finished Voila Wavy spiral curls and created by moist heat. WONT BURN HAIR! Buy one and give one as a gift- small and compact."
1,carusso hair rollers,Found the product very difficult to use and using one roller at a time is very inconvenient. Very disappointed with the product
1,The curls end up all raggedy and inconsistent,"I don't think it's necessarily the products fault. Maybe it just doesn't work with my hair. I have another steam set that's bigger and not as travel friendly but boy the results are unbeatable. I just can't travel with it, so I tried this one just to look super glam when I travel. What a disappointment. I've used it twice. It curls, just that the curls are not smooth at all all crinkly and irregular. I don't like it."
4,Caruso Steam Roller,This is my second set - one for home and one for our weekend cabin. The steam rollers are the only device my fine hair respects and I can set it and be ready to go in less time than I can use a curling iron.
3,Product probably NOT dual voltage,"I'd love to try this hair system. I live overseas, ordered it and it's marked 120V AC, not dual voltage. I dare not plug it in to my 230V household current. Don't know if it's dual voltage or not but not willing to try. Just a warning."
2,Too Cumbersome,"I returned this product. I did not like the inconvenience of heating one roller at a time, and it seemed impossible to roll the hair without rolling it too tight because the foam gives so easily. I was not pleased with the results after only 1 try. I would not recommend this product."
2,stops working,"I bought Caruso steam roller set and loved it. It's quick and makes great curls and waves. In just under a year of intermittent use, though, it has stopped working. No steam will come out, and it's not producing any heat. It happened suddenly, one day it worked, the next it didn't. I can't find a phone number for the company to complain about it. I read some other posts on other sites, and a lot of people have had the same problem. Apparently, the older models work for years and years (I have a friend who's had hers for over 15 years,) but the newer ones break down within a year.I'm very disappointed. I don't want to buy a new one every year, and even if I did, you can't buy just the steamer.It's a shame because when the product works, it works great.Just thought other people might want to know.T"
5,Love them,This is probably my 4th set total. I have used these for probably 10 years and LOVE them. I was a cheerleader in high school and they are so fast and easy and travel well. I put them in and do my make-up while the curl then by the time my make up is done (like7 minutes) I take my hair out of the rollers and am on my way! Anyone who is looking give them a try you won't regret it!
5,Amazing on naturally curly hair,"Preface this by saying that this system won't work for everybody. You California girls with fine, straight hair may not have the best luck with this.However, this product is AMAZING used on naturally wavy or curly hair! After years of using regular hot rollers (and having the curl fall out by the end of the day), I tried this on a friend's recommendation. The results of using this little gizmo were stunning. Not only was there a lot of curl (I actually had to let my hair settle down a bit before styling!) it lasted well into the NEXT DAY.I bought one ten years ago, and it just gave up the ghost last week (so they do hold up well, too). I'm buying another one, needless to say."
2,Disappointing,"The scenery is beautiful but lacks the stunning ""depth"" that Blu-Ray is capable of presenting. Sadly, he music is more ""MUSACK"" than the truly moving 5.1 Surround Sound I was looking for from a BD (the reason I bought it)"
3,"Marty was a monster in Megadeth, but this is a kitten!","Disappointing release, especially since I based my purchase on the reviews posted right here! Rust in Peace by Megadeth remains my favorite Marty Friedman work. The whole thing sounded thrown together to me, nothing real memorable, and I hardly ever listen to it."
5,Designed with the viewer in mind,"Recently I bought the Panasonic 19"" LCD TV. I have been really pleased with it in every respect. The picture has real depth (thanks to plenty of pixels) and the sound quality is amazing (I have taken to playing CDs through the sound system from my Panasonic DVD burner).But it really scores on consumer friendliness. You can adjust picture attributes for each input individually; no more having to find a compromise between off-air and Tivo.You can adjust Zoom to the extent you wish and more..It is a great buy."
1,Boosie is a joke...,Lil Boosie is got to be one of the worst alive.Worst Alive lisrt:1. Lil Boosie2. Lil Webbie3. Yung Joc4. Dem Franchise Boyz5. D4L6. Young Dro7. Young Jeezy8. Lil Wayne9.

Diplomat RappersBad Azz is wack like I dont know what. Thats all I got to say
3,A list of bad explanations,"This book is a case study in misdirecting the public. Never mind that military pilots and others who are trained to observe objects in the air had sighted UFOs, this book lamely lays out cases and tries to explain a few. The result is a few obvious examples of attributing something to nothing. Little more than a repeat of the ""swamp gas"" explanation of a few years prior to this book's publication. I gave it three stars since the publication of this report marked the official end of U.S. Air Force involvement with UFOs.The fact of the matter is that UFOs have not gone away and neither has U.S. Air Force involvement. The book to get to make sense of things is U.F.O.s? Yes! by David Saunders. Although not very illuminating, it does nail down the fact that this study was headed to a predetermined destination."
5,Excellent Product,Added capacity to my MP3 player and cellular phone. Also good for a back up to digital camera.
5,Inexpensive card - works fine,"I am wondering why I bought a 2GB card when market has higher capacities card for a fractional higher cost. The card itself works fine (what does one expect).I bought it for Tom Tom 720 to store my music. I misjudged Tom Tom's SD storage capability. I read somewhere that Tom Tom 720 won't recognize SD cards above 2GB, so I bought this one. I had an HP TravelAssistant RX5915 which runs Windows Mobile OS and Tom Tom as Mapping software and it won't recognize storage above 2GB. So I thought similar problem with Tom Tom 720.Anyways, I am stuck with a 2GB card when the market has 8GB cards for cheap. Also I returned Tom Tom 720..."
4,"Its just, alright.","I got the card about 5 weeks after I ordered it. And then I plugged it in my phone, and the transfer speed is about 200 kb/s. Although it's basically a low quality card in comparison to other brands such as SanDisk, it will do alright for people who just want some more memory on their mobile devices.I would most likely not purchase again."
1,Calendar Girls,"I can't review it because I never received it. This was a Christmas present which I had shipped priority mail. When I questioned it's status, I was given a credit. Thanks for the credit but I would rather have had the video!!"
2,Only good for a rental,"My grandmother actually wanted too see this film so I went along with it but I really couldn't relate too the entire plot. It had a few funny and heartwarming moments. But, don't buy it."
3,Movie Good...Streaming Sporadic,"The movie was good, but Amazon's capability to stream even SD content is severely lacking. We typically stream 780p from Vudu and standard content from Netflix without any of the lag, buffering, and poor connection issues we had with this rental. When the movie started the connection was solid, then it dropped about 10 minutes in and we had to pause the movie to ""re-establish"" a full bar connection again. This would happen through-out the movie and it diminished the value of the viewing a lot.This was the first rental we had from Amazon and until they can shore up their connection speeds it will likely be the last for a good while. The $1.99 was a great price, but not at the expense of a crappy ability to stream."
5,Great movie,Love it more each time I watch it! These ladies are very entertaining. Great actresses in their prime. Watch it you won't be disappointed.
3,long but heartwarming,"This film gets to be a little long and drags itself to a slow end. In it, a woman loses her husband and decides to organize some kind of benefit. Her local women's society is dull as ever, and finally she and her friends agree on a rather unorthodox benefit: a nude calendar of the middle-aged local women's group. Interesting premise (based on a true story) and excellent performances with individuals defying stuffy expectations in the spirit of ""charity"" and of freeing and surprising themselves. As the hubbub around their ""achievement"" escalates, some of the attention goes to their heads, and the friendships start to come undone and families start to suffer. In the end core values of friendship and what friends mean come back into play, but not before edges are frayed. Julie Walters is especially good in her role here, although Helen Mirren (just as in the story itself) will get most of the attention and accolades."
5,"Fun, fun, and more fun!","This isn't a ""Mrs. Pollifax"" book, but it is extremely fun to read, and has many very insightfull characters. This is humor at it's very best, and a bit more besides. Every character in this book ""casts a long shadow."" (Read the book, and you'll know what I'm saying. <EG>)"
1,Sucks Balls,This is the worst book that i have ever tried to read. That is right i couldn't even finish this thing. If you are not being forced by a university to buy this then save your money and buy yourself some booze.
2,"A dissapointing, self-indulgent story","This is a dissapointing, self-indulgent story which must have been interesting for the author to write but is unlikely to engage the average reader. Being a bilingual person myself, I could not find the story interesting, or well written or presented, from a personal perspective. Perhaps Mr Dorfman overlook the well established notion that people are interested in his ideas, opinions and thoughts, not his own personal story which is, like the vast majority of men and women, of no consequence or interest except for some defining moments. A boring read, which I cannot possibly recommend."
2,Beautiful Stylling but...,"I really like the styling of these earrings, and they're well made, but they weren't very shiny or sparkly. I don't think they're worth the price. I returned them."
5,very pretty,"These earrings are amazing!!! they look much more expensive than their price. very fancy-looking, I will be wearing them for my wedding, Absolutely love them!!"
2,Piers strange book,"Well Iwas hoping for something better than this despite the title. While accepting the strong sexual content as Antony's style the story seemed too tongue in cheek for my taste, hope for something a little more profound"
3,Yikes!,"When I was in college, I taught human sexuality. But this book left me blushing in my permanent tan (I'm a Black woman).I'll just keep chanting ""I am not a prude. I am not a prude."" Nope. That didn't help!Don't read this expecting a visit to a risque Xanth. You'll find yourself surprised."
3,Loved it With Reservations...,I liked this product however please be aware that the sound quality isn't remotely as good as a modern stereo or home theatre system especially in the volume and bass department. I choose to hook up a couple of quality speakers to my unit which was easy and I really enjoy it now. However others might not feel that way. The actual unit is beautiful and very easy to use. I am happy with my purchase however please be warned that the sound quality/speakers it comes with are not that great.
2,CD Player does not work,"I have an extensive vinyl collection and was very excited to receive this product. Unfortunately the cd player does not work and I will have to return it. The motor makes a whirring noise, and it does not read or play the cds. I read some other reviews where it actually ate some users' cds, It just seems very cheaply made, which is a shame considering it could be a really great piece. I contemplated keeping it just to use the record player, but even that feels a little weird to use. It's disappointing because the item itself is actually quite beautiful."
5,Beautiful and sad love story,"This movie is a favorite of my mentor in college, and it took me eight years to get around to watching it. Although the character development isn't what we would expect from more contemporary movies, the theme is universal, the imagery is beautiful, and the story is gripping, touching and wonderful. It is a love story unlike any love story I have ever encountered."
5,A classic,"Great cast, great idea, perfect location, incomparable score by the underappreciated Bernard Herrmann; it's sad and funny and yes, romantic. One of the few enduring films, it's timeless. At its very heart is a wonderful relationship that is inherently limited and yet, unlimited; until memory comes into play. The ending is very poignant. Everyone on the planet should see this film at least once in their life."
5,Love this since I was a teen,Another great!What can one say with such great actors. I seen this moive more times than I can tell you. At long last I bought the DVD and enjoy this wonderful heart touching and yet funny movie now whenever I want to.If you dont buy it your passing up a great movie that should be shown to the whole family.Keep a pice of movie history as no one can ever replace the actors of the pass.
5,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,Put this in on a rainy day and thoroughly enjoy yourself. Sweet and tender. A classic romance. Never tire of it. Rex Harrison is a perfect sea captain.
5,Excellent movie,"This is a very good movie. I have looked for a long time for it. So happy I found it. Such a good story line. The very ending could make you cry, but it is an excellent movie. I recommend it to everyone."
5,The greatest romance,"I know this sounds cliched, but it is truly the most moving, beautiful, emotional and breathtaking book I have read. I picked the book out simply because I liked the cover, and when I started reading, I couldn't put it down. What I love is the story of the interracial marriage. How two people from two worlds could come together as one. Simply beautiful."
4,Excellent,"The only limitation this pan has is that it's not dishwasher safe. It's the perfect size to prepare meals for one to four, cooks evenly and retains heat vey well. The weight is easy to manage even when the pan holds heavy soups ans sauces. The glass lid makes it easy to keep an eye on the progress of your dish. Last, the non-stick surface is very easys to clean by hand. All around great chef's pan."
2,Taras Bulba DVD Review,Taras Bulba is a pretentious film with poor dialogue and phony characters. The only decent thing about this film is Franz Waxman's musical score.
5,Book of Numbers,"Excellent Bible commentary. Will of great help to me, when I prepare for sunday school class."
5,Ten years old...,"This book is a classic! To Derek who posted a recent review (October 2003), note that this book was written something like 10 years ago! That's why it's outdated. Still a great book, though!"
4,Two CDs Total Only 87 Minutes,"Good stuff, but be aware that the combined length of both CDs in this two-CD set totals only 87 minutes -- in other words, a mere seven minutes more than what would have fit on a single CD."
2,sorry to say--boring,"I have LOVED Richard Thompson for years! But, I have to say, this is not a very interesting CD. Nothing comes close to the genius of ""Vincent 1952"" and many other previous songs. I was so looking forward to this new CD and was very disappointed. I'll keep playing RT's earlier CDs and await his next one with hope."
1,defective download,bought and it will not download...waste of money waste of money waste of money waste of money waste of money waste of money
4,two thumbs up for the christians,"im not really a christian, I was just curious and started to listen to the christian metal bands....this cd is really good.I was surprised that christian metal sounded so heavy.Very impressive Jesus lovers, I hope these bands are really christians"
5,"A WORD ON ""OWLS""",BERND HEINRICH IS ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS IN THE LIFE SCIENCE FIELD. HIS WONDERFULY DISCRIPTIVE NARATIVES ARE REMINISSENT OF KONRAD LORENZ AND GERALD DURREL . ONE MAN'S OWL WILL EDUCATE YOU AND PULL YOUR HEART STRINGS. BUY THIS BOOK!!
2,"some good, some bad","some of the recipes work, some don't. i've made the white chocolate whisper cake several times and it always turns out. however, the country buttermilk cake NEVER works -- the liquid measurement (2/3 cup) of buttermilk does NOT equal the given weight in ounces or grams. two-thirds of a cup of buttermilk equals 120 grams / a little over 4 ounces, yet the recipe says 160 grams / 5.5 ounces. this will make or break the recipe, and apparently it breaks it.rose has a blog web site which i went to looking for help. this is march, 2011, yet she has not answered a single query on her web site since 2009.i'm no longer impressed with the ""bible."""
3,The Cake Bible,I have tried to bake several of the cake recipes and buttercream recipes. I have 6 years experience an I found them difficult to follow...The flower construction section with pictures was great as is the reference section...Many of the recipes do not contain items you would normally have in you house. I find I rarely open this book to bake from as a result. I use it often for reference.
3,Fine for some people,"I borrowed this from a friend and made a couple of cakes but as one reviewer said, this book is for people who like a challenge. I'm just not sure how many people have time for this kind of a challenge. If you are someone who would resort to a cake mix rather than try these REALLY complicated cakes, I encourage you to check out Cakes From Scratch in Half the Time by Linda West Eckhardt."
5,Best cake cook book EVER!,This IS the cake bible. These recipes are incredible and are quaranteed to come out perfect if you follow the recipe. This will make a perfect gift for anyone!
5,One of the most comprehensive books of its kind.,"I am a culinary student concentrating on baking/pastries and this is one of the best books on the subject I have found, for both beginners and experienced bakers alike. I highly recommend it."
3,DRY cake,"I have been asked by my in laws who are renewing their vows in Nov., 2011 to make their 3-tier cake. I saw this book on tv and decided to try it. I made the yellow butter cake. The cake had a wonderful smell and flavor but it was dry super dry. I have made the recipe 3 different times but all 3 times it came out dried. I used the simply syrup it recommened but it was either I didn't use enough the first two times or I used too much the third time that the cake cracked. I did make a lemon curd mousseline filling & a vanilla bavarian cream from the book. The two fillings were so tasty. I am not happy with the cake recipe but as for the fillings they are truly delicious.If any one knows of a wedding cake book that the cake is not dry, please let me knowThank you"
1,Surprisingly Disappointed,"I began baking from scratch a little over a year ago and the Cake Bible was the must have book. I stocked my kitchen, was eager to learn and expand my horizons but the cakes from the Cake Bible were dry and the icings were greasy. I was convinced it was me. I almost gave up my new hobby. Then I found several very good food blogs(Annie's Eats, Pioneer Woman, Brown Eyed Baker and Smitten Kitchen) and began using their recipes. Success!!! I even started getting requests for my baked goods. With my confidence in full swing I thought I would give her next book a try...Rose's Heavenly Cakes. The cakes did sound heavenly....banana, coconut, red velvet! I've tried 3 recipes with the same results....dry, disappointing and unimpressive. Still thinking I was doing something wrong I checked out the reviews on Amazon. I was surprised and relieved to find out that I was not alone in my experiences. So I encourage all you bakers not to give up and to find another recipe book."
3,Undecided,"When I got this book, I was thrilled. I am a decent baker, I like detailed descriptions, I thought this would take my baking to the next level. Yesterday I made one of the cakes. I weighed, measured, was precise, even used a cake strip on the pan. after 30 minutes the cake was too wet. I waited another ten, just like the recipe said, took the cake out. Cooled it, glazed it, snd when we ate it, it was like dust. Too dry, too overdone. I wish I had ignored her and only waited five minutes. Maybe I am having oven temp issues . . Although this is not usually a problem. I will try one more cake, but I am afraid that the recipes are just too precise and too demanding. and there was a mistake in the recipe it said 8 tablespoons of butter was 5 ounces. I just don't know about this book.And the cake was supposed to be flat, just because of the ingredients, and it was slightly mounded."
3,OKAY,"Okay, nothing to write home about. I would not purchase this product again. No specific reason, it just isn't special enough."
4,Upward Mobility,This is a story of one man whom starts as the lowest member of soceity: a slave. Through luck and careful planning he moves up to find his freedom and begin a new community where slavery is not the norm. The idea of a child owning an adult male as a slave was quite attractive to me when I first read this book. Now it's a bit distrubing. But the message that one can move up through hard work is still appealing while the slavery is still erotic.
4,Move over N'Sync and Backstreet... There's a new kid in town,"I think Bossom is a great singer and his single the remix for his single ""We Live"" is as American as apple pie. I have a feeling this guy will be around for a while. I can't wait for the album release."
4,Pronunciation Problems,"It's truly wonderful that Teach Yourself is producing such excellent cd's and texts for simple conversation. Unfortunately, only a few of them have any guides for pronunciation, other than the native voices. This Irish course makes things even more difficult because the speakers on the cd's apparently come from different dialect areas and the very first sentence, repeated by both people (good morning), is pronounced differently. Which is the more widespread form? Why didn't anyone discover this while recording? I guess I'll memorize the one that is easiest and move on, and hope to find a local native speaker. To supplement the basic conversations, you might like the Teach Yourself Irish book and cd's."
5,WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW,This is a wonderful book. This is my first Suzanne Brockmann book and wont be the last!...This story is so emotional and romantic! Steamy too! Its about true love!I recommend this one to anyone who loves a true romance book filled with real emotions that grab you from page 1! The hero is NOT whimpy like other reviews say..instead hes real about his feelings and not afraid to show it!Get this one! This is a woderful heart moving book that you will want to read a million times over!
5,WONDERFUL!!!!,"Heart-wrenching, enthralling, poignant and captivating. This latest work of Ms. Brockmann's is everything that I have come to expect from this talented author. Jax is a sweetheart of a man that proves to be a unique and irresistible hero. Though this book was written years ago when Ms. Brockmann was just starting out in her writing career, she brings us a well written and heartfelt story that captivates readers."
4,A slapstick extravaganza with likable villains and a baby,"The first time I saw this movie, I laughed until I couldn't breathe. It harkens back to the very best Sweet Pea / Popeye cartoons, and involves three, otherwise very likeable, bumbling villain and a baby on the loose for his first taste of the world at large. Very good fun."
5,FUNNY-FUNNY-FUNNY,One of the funniest movies ever made!!!! Joe Mantegna and Joe Pantoliano are fantastic!!! The whole family will enjoy this movie! Gets funnier every time I see it!!!
3,good,hi who ever is reading this:the video is so good and funnywhen i got it from the post office theysaid that the form that it was shipped wasthe the corrects form.
5,Humor has staying power. Suitable for more than just kids.,"Why should kids have all the fun? This movie is hilarious, even after several viewings. It's a film that can be enjoyed by the whole family, from youngest to oldest. It's like Jumanji in that it keeps you wondering what over-the-top circumstance is coming next. No heavy social commentary here, only lighthearted fun. The comic timing of the actors is wonderful, and the child handlers deliver a portrayal of Baby Bink that is expressive and on target. Definitely worth the space in a home video/DVD library."
3,okay album,"I respect this album in that it was made to help Wes King; however, the musicians that were chosen did not seem to resonate with Wes King's songs as I would have hoped. It was an okay album, but not great. I did like Adison Road's version of one of his songs though."
5,DAN non ni smentisce mai!!!,"Dopo quasi 40 anni di carriera questo cantante-chitarrista bretone, legato moltissimo alla sua terra, è ancora ispirato e sforna un altro album di ottima qualità, con brani rilassanti e suonati molto bene: un album che si ascolta con spensieratezza e risulta molto gradevole in ogni sua canzone"
1,poor quality,"I purchased this watch for my husband as a Christmas gift. It arrived promptly and seemed very nice. My husband did not start to use the watch until a month ago. The leather strap broke off within a few days but the watch was still usable. About a week later the lid broke and is unrepairable. I contacted the company and their response was because it had been purchased almost 3 months ago they doubted they could do anything about. Actually the watch was used less than one month. Even if they doubt my word, it broke within 3 months of purchase. I am disappointed by the quality of the watch and the seller's response."
1,misleading advertising on the quantity,"Very poor, as bad as you can get to advertise the quantity as 50 but only ship 2 discs. Web page is deceiving. The way it is worded makes you think you will get 50 discs, but you only get 2."
4,Nice comeback concert,Goes through all the favourites and gives a few bonuses as well but I have to say that the version of Bela Lugosi Is Dead is not half as good as the one on Press The Eject And Give Me The Tape. That one has a more claustrophobic nature to it. As for the cover version of the Dead Can Dance song - it's good but I would prefer to hear the original
5,You Can Hear the Fog Machine Whir...,"Not many bands can pull off the solid-black thing without eliciting giggles, but this one does. I thought the Bauhaus were great 10-15 years ago, and was leery of getting this disc for fear it would be one of those sad reunion albums that always seem to come out a decade after the ""final"" tour. But not so! These guys still wallow in existential angst with the best of 'em. If anything, Peter Murphy's delivery is more substantial after a decade of great albums and vocal growth. And the band proves that they can still play rough, even after the pop and polish of Love and Rockets."
2,"Oh, so now they call themselves gothic?","As a long time Bauhaus fan, I must say this album is unforgivenly disapointing. The sound is no good and I expected they would sophisticate their songs after 16 years of learning how to play. Bauhaus was basicaly a punk band, now they assume their popularity among the gothic audience and call themselves gothic. For me, they sound just like old punks, and when you're punk you can do everything but growing old. If you wanna hear them live, buy ""Press The Eject"" or the semi oficial ""Rest in Peace"". ""Gotham"" is just a bunch of oldmen covering Bauhaus."
2,Monsieur Musk Impostor,It appears Dana has changed the formula for success. I've used Monsieur Musk for many years and this product is not the same. The fragrance is different from the original.
1,weak cologne spray,The product was advertised as cologne but arrived as cologne spray. I have used this product since the 1970s and the quality/strength of this particular item is weak and does not last. Very disappointed. I've purchased many bottles through Amazon and this is the first one that failed.
1,NOT A GOOD PUZZLE FOR LEARNING YOUR ABCs!,"Let me start out by saying, I LOVE Melissa and Doug products. If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I LOVE their Chunky Puzzles.But I DO NOT RECOMMEND this one at all!1. This is not a good Chunky puzzle. It is much more flimsy and the stickers peel off the pieces.2. The pieces are NOT shaped like the letter. So more than one letter will fit in more than one spot... Like the O, G, and C will all fit in the same spots.3. The pictures used to describe the letter are ODD choices... The first time I did the puzzle with my son, it took me a few seconds to figure out what the pieces were supposed to be.4. These pieces are a lot smaller than most of the Melissa and Doug puzzle pieces.I was very disappointed with this puzzle and bought the other Melissa and Doug alphabet puzzle to replace this one!"
3,Alphabet is incorrect....seriously?,"I loved the idea of this puzzle for my 2 year old daughter who LOVES puzzles. I thought this would be a great way for her to learn the alphabet...but the M is missing and there are 2 H's. I tried to find a way to contact the seller without having to write a product review but there is not an option to contact the seller directly. If the alphabet was correct, I would have rated the puzzle much better."
5,nice puzzle,"This is a nice sturdy puzzle, which my toddler loves. Also I would like to add that ""F"" is for ""fish"" not bird, and I don't really think that these symbols are too obtuse for a young kid learning the alphabet. The pegs are a good size for little hands too."
2,2 Stars for two great actresses who deserve better.,"Angela Bassett and Loretta Divine are two of this countries best actresses. However, this film had one MAJOR PROBLEM and her name is Whitney Houston. Those studio heads with below average intelligence thought that because Bodyguard made millions that she was a movie star. When in actuallity all she is is a soundtrack star. Her studio recordings have been dismal and she is fading once again. Her pain inducing ""acting"" is no longer required for public consumption. But Angela was beautiful, wasn't she?"
3,Waiting to Exhale Strikes A Blow to 90's relationships,"Contrary to popular belief, Waiting to Exhale is not an unabashed anti-male bashfest...It is, instead, an indictment of the choices and consequences that African-American women make regarding their careers and romantic lives...Although the stories involved make for great fiction, Terry McMillan's characters highlight the ignorance and stupidity that threaten to destroy the fabric of black love in the 1990's...Forest Whitaker's direction, and top-notch performances by Angela Bassett, Gregory Hines, and Wesley Snipes, in an unbilled cameo, make this movie soar. END"
2,"Good music, beautiful actresses, DUMB movie!","Why would women as beautiful as Whitney, Angela and Lela sleep with men who are obviously either jerks or otherwise engaged? So they can sit around and cry and feel sorry for themselves when these guys (what a shocker!) turn out to be just as rotten as the audience knew they were from the beginning."
5,Fun for white heterosexual males!,"I'm not gay, but I loved this movie. When Angela Bassett (foxy, foxy FOXY!) burned that car I jumped up and yelled ""You go, girl!"" and I almost knocked over my wine spritzer. My mom was like ""shut up."" I gave her the finger but she didn't see because she was upstairs on ""the machine."" She's invalid, but she just says she's resting. Screw her. Walk! Anyway, I wish I was Whitney Houston. I'd punch that Bobby Brown in the teeth and then sleep in satin. My life makes me cry... I'm still waiting to exhale..."
4,Enjoyable movie,This movie was well made and was enjoyable. The soundtrack is also very good. Whitney Houston does a good job acting along with the other cast.
2,Buy a real plunger.,Its so fake... i mean.. weak.. feeling.. I'm scared to use it in a real situation. I wasted my money.. but for 15 bucks.. if it works twice I will be happy. I will update to see if this thing is any good.
5,Finally - as good as.advertised,"I have a lung problem so when a sink or commode is plugged it is very difficult for me. I purchased this product really believing it couldn't work as easy as it has been advertised on Tv. Well, it is so easy to use that I thought it wasn't working. This is one of the best household products I HAVE EVER purchased."
1,what the $%&???!!!,"Why would you buy this piece of S**T when you can get Pyromania and Hysteria by the original band? Don't waste your money!! And those who say this album is good, you've OBVIOUSLY never heard Def Leppard play."
1,Rust In The Dust ~ Anything But Divine,"'Lust in the Dust' released in '84 is an irreverent parody on spaghetti westerns that just doesn't hit the target. I did enjoy Tab Hunter doing his best Clint Eastwood impersonation in the role of gunfighter/drifter Abel Wood and Gina Gallego was a lovely addition as working girl Ninfa, however that is the extent of anything positive I have to say about this film. I'm not a prude by any means and can on occasion enjoy low brow humour as well as the next guy but this movie couldn't ellicit as much as one laugh out of me.Lesson for Today: Irreverent and crude doesn't necessarily translate into funny and entertaining. For Divine fans only."
5,Good Book,"I recommend this book. Is very important to not english speakers, like me. Is easy to understand and with the cd all the things make a sense.In my country this book is more expensive than Amazon. Here were the best option for me! Thanks"
4,Don't buy it for elementary or intermediate level,"As a reference for thorny grammar questions from advanced students, it's fine but as a classroom book, it's too detailed and too advanced. I have a copy but I rarely use it - the Intermediate and my ol' favorite, Beginning Grammar in Use are usually better suited for my lessons."
3,Zorp,"This was pretty good, kind of like Doo Rag, only you can understand most of what the guy's singing. Very hillbilly/blues oriented, maybe like an acoustic Cramps. Not necessarily to be taken seriously, and kind of bordering on caricature.The song about Lon Chaney has really weird lyrics and is worth the price of the album."
1,Bad Product,We just purchased this item and it is now can't be operate. It is broke and we need to return it. Cannot be use for sharpen the pencil anymore.
4,Fine clamping system,These are smooth working screw clamps. The only issue I have with them is getting used to the rubber caps which can slide off in certain situations.
2,I wasnt so lucky,"Bought based on the reviews, needed some heavier duty clamps than my 1/2""... what i received was a box of 12 sets, but atleast half had thread problems as well as castings were not square to each other when tightened, consequently not giving good compression across the rubber.....i thought it was a waste of money, Amazon cheerfully refunded, and i noticed product has not been available since ? ?IF for no other reason, You gotta love Amazon for taking their responsibility to customer service so seriously"
4,Great value,"The cost is low for these pipe clamps, but the quality is fine. They work as well as other more-expensive clamps. No complaints."
2,"Good, but not for swing traders","This is a good book, with very complete info on many market topics. The problem is that the focus is more on day trading than swing trading. There is little or no real info or real life examples of swing trading styles and strategies. Instead it focuses too heavily on market mechanics more relevant to day trading.The writing style is fairly easy to read, but the poor editing and grammar made me question the quality of what I was reading.Not too bad, but still disapointing. I'm left still looking for a good book on swing trading."
1,Not about Swing Trading at all,"I bought this book specifically because I thought from the title that it would be about swing trading, and in particular Gann's method of swing trading (since he was the one who coined the phrase), so I was terribly disappointed after reading it to discover that it made no mention of Gann, nor any mention of the method of swing trading. Sure it mentions the word ""swing"" a lot, but nowhere in the book does it actually tell you about the method of swing trading itself.The book is no more than a general introduction to the whole business of trading, which as a previous reviewer noted, information such as this can be gained from any of 100 sources. And if its an introduction you want, you're better off getting John J. Murphy's ""Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets"".The ""Buy Used and New from $5.99"" says it all...sorry, this book is not what it says it is."
2,Not impressed,"This salt is very very 'salty' with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.There are better products (search for South African East Coast sea salt).I much prefer Maldon's, which is hardly gourmet."
3,Rick Astley review,"His voice is still good, but different. More mature and sounds like a jazz lounge act now. Preferred his old sound although disco is dead."
4,comfortable quality boots,"These boots are made from soft, high quality leather. They are comfortable to wear all day long. This is my second pair because I was so impressed with the first pair."
5,Love these boots!,This is probably the 6th pair of these boots I've had. I work in the oil and gas drilling industry and these boots are great. They usually last a bit over a year on average and they're comfortable on steel for 12 hr days. I do add an insert for extra cussion. They have great traction and the tread really holds up.
3,Not the quality I expected,"I'm giving this 3 stars because it is unique and attractive, but below my expectations. They claim to be hand painted, but It looks like a sheet of paper was inlayed instead. And it also warns you to keep it dry which also indicates that it is some kind of paper, not individually painted. The crystals are tiny so they don't stand out much either. For the price, I would have sent this back if it wasn't so close to Christmas."
4,Simply Beautiful,I bought this project after hearing a few samples and I knew this CD had to be in my collection.The production on this CD is simply and not overdone; the harmonies and the instrumentation are beautiful in a way that incorporates you in the presence of God.Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed...
5,favorite Christmas music - ever!,"Do you want fun, perky, up-beat music? Look no further with the Andrews Sisters. It's not Christmas without them belting out the classics with Bing."
1,What's worse than poor?,"This is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was I actually paid money for it. About 100 pages were a repeat of the previous page. The characters were unrealistic, and the plot typical. What's worse than poor? That's how I would describe this book."
3,Linecounter,For soaking suckers to catch musky its sufficient. I only drop them 5 to 10ft. But I noticed the actual counters get jacked up and tend to get stuck in frigid weather. Once you bring them back in to warm them up they are fine. I still would by this product for the price.
4,Personal Stories,This book was very helpful to my daughter when she was working on her 7th grade wagon train project. Insight as to how difficult the journey west was for those who were brave enough to try.
3,"For light beer, it's okay.","I watched this movie on 1080i, with 5.1 Dolby Pro Logic, and have to say it is an above average comedy. I do think it is very funny, but the blu ray disc capabilities do not shine in this disk. The picture is great, sound is okay, and the extras are limited. Unless you have to see this in it's clearest format, the DVD would suffice."
1,Great movie for an 8th grader who's never seen boobs.,"Is this what society has come to? I enjoy stupid movies, seen many of them. This one was horrible. Don't waste your money. It'll be in the dollar stores in a matter of days. (And that may still be too much money!)"
1,beer fest,hi well can't really give a review on this movie cause i still have yet to receive really don't know why
4,Don't Hate It Because It's Stupid!,"You will definately feel like you lost a few brain cells after watching this movie. But you know, it really made me laugh. If you ever went to college and participated in any of the following drinking games; quarters, mexican, beer bongs, etc you will think this movie is funny. It's been a long time since I've partied like that, but it all came back to me and I laughed. I think that is the point."
5,Beerfest,"Funny movie, wish these guys would finish supertroopers 2 but oh well. The price was great and got it rather quickly."
1,"A new low! (Watch THIS ... and you could, potentially, become much DUMBER!)","Seriously: it's like they were so unable -- and afraid -- to come up with a real ""conflict"" so THIS is the best they could do ... ick!It's lazily & insultingly stupid in a way that you couldn't even imagine anyone could ""achieve"" before, or would ""bother"" to ""try""; sort of an ""inverse Stanley Kubrick."" (Giving you that ""Where on EARTH did they come up with this?"" impression -- except, you know, in the OPPOSITE direction of being ""awed"" or ""amazed""!)Bleah! Phooey!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------ON THE OTHER HAND: I lost ten (10) minutes of my life (i.e., from hysterical, helpless, totally-lost-it laughter) when Will Ferrell says: ""Get -- get OUT of TOWN! That's OUTRAGEOUS!"" in THIS movie:The Other Guys (The Unrated Other Edition)"
3,"Dumb...Freshman...But, Yet Funny","This is one of the most freshman movies ever. But, like any good car wreck, you can't take your eyes off it. It is side-splittingly funny in parts. Is there actually a story here??? Yes, there is...and it is not too terribly bad. Sophmoric humor is too much of a compliment, so I call this one ""freshman humor"". The gratuitious nudity at the beginning is just dumb, but the rest fits the plot. And in the end, what's not to like...it is about BEER after all..."
4,Almost there,"The Broken Lizard crew has done it again. They seem t opush the envelope a little further each time. ALthough I feel Supertroopers is by far the funniest, and Puddle Cruisers the least funny, you gotta hand it to these guys for coming back again and again. I knew it was going to be good when I read the opening warning ""IF YOU DRINK THIS MUCH BEER YOU WILL DIE!!"" If you enjoyed the other Broken Lizard movies you will not be disappointed here."
1,Skip It!!,"This is definately a movie to SKIP! It just plain sucked! Simple as that. It belongs in the $4.99 bin a Wal-mart but you still won't see me buying it. Glad I rented it first although it would be nice to get my money back. You can read about the plot from the other reviews. I thought it would appeal to me but I guess I would have had to be as drunk as the guys in the movie to enjoy it. Do yourself a favor, and look for something else!"
2,"Questionable Quality, Poor Mfg. Customer Service","I should have known better - you get what you pay for. Knowing that I would likely only use this product a dozen times before my youngest child would out grow it, I thought I could get away ""very cheap"". Unfortunately, this product exceeded my expectations, on the downside, of quality. I'm not even sure that this thing would last through a year of use. In addition to the general poor quality (see other reviews), the coaster hub did not work - the peddles would continue to turn if the child tried to coast. I attempted to get the manufacturer to send me a replacement hub, but after waiting 10 days, still didn't receive the shipment as promised. After calling again, they said another was ""on the way"" but would arrive after the Amazon ""last chance to return"" window. Decided that it was not worth the risk of dealing with a poor quality product AND lame customer service. I'll spend another $100 and avoid any further hassle....."
2,Picture was misleading in color available,"When I placed the order, there was a different picture than there is now. It was a navy blue with silver co-pilot bike. There was nothing to indicate other colors. When the bike was received it was all white, which did not match my bike. When I called the company, they said white was all that they had and that Amazon had the wrong picture on the web. I was upset because I felt that the picture was misleading and even though they tried to blame Amazon, they should've known what they were selling on the web, so there is no excuse."
5,This is awesome!,"I have taken my son out for 3 rides on this new bike trailer since receiving it. It is absolutely everything I had hoped it would be and more. It only took 30 minutes to put it all together, and the attachment that connects the trailer to my bike only took 4 bolts to install. My 3, almost 4-year-old can't quite do the pedals all the way, but he thinks he is and can just ride without pedaling if he wants. Worth the money, for sure."
1,You get what you pay for...don't go cheap on this!,"We were all set for our bike ride...we made it about 1 mile, if that, and the WeeRide wheel froze up---wouldn't budge....we were stranded unless my daughter and I wanted to walk and drag the tire all the way home which would have ruined the tire and at that point I didn't know what was wrong so I decided against that. Fortunately a police man happened to be driving by and had to give us a ride home...so much for the bikeride and picnic my daughter was soo excited about.Turned out, per our local bike repair shop, that there was a factory defect with the wheel. The sprocket on the wheel was cross threaded-- which relative to the cost of the bike, was a costly repair.Had to return the bike. My recommendation: Don't go cheap- you get poor quality!"
4,"a stiff ride, a tough build","I was skeptical when I read the many reviews posted about this bicycle attachment. My first grade foster son is too young for single bike, yet I want to be able to take bike rides. I ordered the co-pilot and put it together when it arrived. Several of the instructions in the manual left me to some creative interpretation. Some of the parts were stiff and difficult to turn, move and attach, but I used a rubber mallet and I was good to go. Aside from the instructions, the bike seems solid and well constructed. The comments about the turns and difficulties with sharp turns is true, in my opinion. Definately takes practice from both of us."
1,Broke apart while riding,"Our 3 year old daughter LOVED this and we used it approx. 4 times. On the last ride with her on it, my husband was just pulling in our driveway and all I heard was crash and then crying. I saw her on the ground, the bike broken apart and my husband standing there in disbelief. The bike literally just broke apart at a place where it should have been welded...maybe this was welded wrong, but needless to say - this thing is not safe! Imagine if it broke apart when crossing a road, not in our driveway!!!! Completely dissatisfied!"
4,FIRST RIDE,"I was able to take my 4 year old grand-daughter on a ride last night. She was a little scared to start but we both the hang of it pretty quick. She was thrilled to be able to stay up with Nana, which is the issue when we try to ride our bikes together. Can't wait to do some more riding. Looking for a second hitch so I can use either of my bikes.best,Nana"
4,Nice for the price,"Good product, was concerned before purchase based on other reviews. I had no problem with assembly. on the first couple of uses the mounting bracket seemed to turn on the seat post but then I realized it was the seat post itself that was turning. Tightened its bolt and everything is working fine."
5,The only way to ride together,"Bought this in April 2009. I ride with my 6 year old. Other trailers I considered advertised no movement (stability), but cost much more. When riding, any wiggle is hardley noticed, can't tell any difference between wiggle and bumps in road. It's now beginning of August 2009 and we ride about every other day. I added a small basket to front for her drinks. I don't have to stop and she dosen't forget to drink.Without this trailer there is no way she would last and riding close to city traffic would be impossible."
2,For beginners but just that!,"This may be OK for beginners but has too many gaps for anyone else. It is nice to be able to keep your verbs in your pocket, but not nice if the book you keep in your pocket does not come up with the goods when you need it. Perhaps for beginners but just that."
4,More Spacy than Racy,"Call it the flip side to King Kong's 1995 concept album, BIG BANG, where unibrowed genius Ethan Buckler told the story of a man, a yak, and the ice age that tore them apart.Produced by ex-Royal Trux man Neil Hagerty, BIG BANG is a post(as opposed to pre)-historic venture beyond the stars.Especially on their last two albs, ME HUNGRY and 97's KINGDOM OF KONG, Buckler's always been sort of a foul-mouthed second grade life sciences teacher, plainly explaining simple physical processes with the F-word tossed in here and there.Here, King Kong becomes even more of a nerdy jam band than ever before. The tunes are stretched out for hours (well upwards of 8 minutes most of the time), and there's less of the blunt humour that I used to really like.There's also a pretty liberal use of electronics, and y'know, if the right people here this, it could be freakin' huge!I prefered the stone age smut of ME HUNGRY, but the BIG BANG ain't no small potatoes."
3,Pick Longenecker instead,"This is an OK commentary, but not as excellent as other volumes in this series. I'd put my money on Longenecker (WBC) instead, which is quite easily read despite the technical format of that series."
2,Disappointing,"Hailing from my hometown of Fresno, CA, Let's Go Bowling was one of the first ska bands I was exposed to in the early nineties, and have remained a sentimental favorite of mine. I bought this album expecting an evolution of the same band that produced ""Music to Bowl By"" and ""Mr. Twist,"" but was shocked and sadly disappointed to discover their sound had drifted VERY far away from their roots. Maybe I was expecting too much, but if you are looking for good Third Wave ska with a First Wave mentality, steer clear of this album."
5,HBR on CHANGE--great little book,"HBR is ""the"" source for major management topics. This is one of the best, on a topic of importance to real managers trying to manage change in a wild world. Seminal resources. Will be read and re-read."
4,THIS LADY IS BAAAAAAD!!!!!,"Now this is Gospel Music at it's best!! If you haven't bought this CD yet, I highly suggest it! This lady is not a joke!! Her vocals are slammin' plus she can take it back to the old-time way, and hit the young people with some contemporary funk! And my favorite track happens to be ""Get Me Out Jesus."" So for all you backsliding, unbelievers, you need to hear this song. She's gonna tell you like it really is. So those of you who don't like to hear the truth, don't listen to that particular track! But you can still buy the CD! The lady is baaaaad!!"
5,The Scurvy Dog: King of the Sea!,"My friends and I had a blast in this pool! It was definitely worth the money. Since we had a great experience with the product, I want to defend the honor of the Scurvy Dog!1. The size was PERFECT. We fit FOUR FULL GROWN ADULTS (late 20s) in it without an issue. Everyone had space to sit and enjoy the water.2. The pool didn't tear ANYWHERE (including the slide) after a full day of use. Keep in mind my pals are a rowdy bunch that could match the might of any group of children.3. We had absolutely NO issues inflating or deflating it. It took about a half hour TOPS to do it. This was done with ONE electric air pump and lung power on the small areas."
1,"This one is fair, at best. For the hardcore 66er only!","If you're interested in the Mother Road and want a tape to inform and let you know how the road and people are today, you do NOT want this tape.Filmed in the mid 80s, this tape is NOT an accurate depiction of the road as it is today.As the road is always changing, restaurants and motels opening and closing, buildings being torn down, etc. - I found this tape useful in providing a view of 66's roadside as it was in the 80s, and not much else."
5,Her voice is magnificent,I love her voice and her fearlessness. She will say whatever is on her mind and she is a genius like her brother and her mom.
5,Great book but i thought it was supposed to be a SERIES?,"Hey great work on Into the Land of the Unicorns, Bruce, but it says this is a Series? I have been waiting for something like 3 YEARS for the next one to come out. He wrote A Glory of Unicorns, but that WASN'T the sequel like i was expecting it to be. Hey come on, you cant have a one book series, it is a contradiction! The way this is going i will grow old and die by the time the next book comes out.Hey but dont let my whining bother you, i really loved the book. If you love unicorns, magic, or things like that, get this! Also check out the Harry Potter series...AMAZING!"
1,Disappointed,Still havnt received my book!! Supposed to revive it October 22 it's now nov 12. Not to impressed with this websit taking my money & not giving me the product I paid for ?!
3,You can see the gears,"I really like this story, but I didn't like the way the author presented it. It didn't flow; it didn't move from one action to the next of its own accord. You could see the author plotting the story and pushing the action to its conclusion, which was annoying. While reading it, I was aware of the fact that it was a story in a book. For contrast, when I read The Chronicles of Narnia, it is as if the action is really happening, outside of the book.The book is intended for 9-12 year olds, and I don't think most of them would notice this. Certainly my nephew didn't when he read it in Junior High. But an avid reader might feel somewhat cheated by the poor mechanics. And if you are an adult fan of juevenile fantasy (e.g., Harry Potter, The Frightened Forest, Timothy and Two Witches, etc.) you will be less impressed."
1,Bad Writing and Editing,"No offense to Col Fox's military service but this book was poorly written and edited. Some examples:Poor grammar:pp xiv: ""No enemy soldiers were in my way or took me under fire in the blackness.""pp 44: ""Because of the lateness of the night, no food other than C-rations was found.""pp 50: ""Canon fire from the gun tank cut the bridge loose from the north bank...""Almost one grammar error on every page. There are also sophomoric bulleted lessons learned at the end of each chapter, that detract from the text. The pictures are oddly captioned in the third person, a rookie mistake for an autobiography. This book should not have been published without extensive editing."
5,"I still adore this book, almost 15 years later","I'm sad that other reviews (but one) did not like this book. I loved it when it first came out, and it is still one of my favorite books on apparel. The lists are are helpful place to start building a wardrobe, and many of the suggestions are true over a decade later. Chic Simple Clothes was the first time I'd seen outfits put together in such a minimalist/clean and appealing way, and I never tire of flipping through the now dogeared pages.Yes, the information may seem to be spread thin, especially given all the other Chic Simple books, but don't forget this was the first book.If readers are looking for trends, this isn't the book, but for timeless fashion, Chic Simple Clothes is a great reference."
3,Will Pattie and her family survive on Planet Shine?,I rate this book a *** star book. This is about a girl and family go into a spaceship with some other people to another Solar System because Earth is dying. When they get to the new planet Pattie names it Shine! Read this book to find out what they do on planet Shine and if they can survive on it!
5,The Best Book Ever,"I think this book was very exciting. The kids always find stuff and help survive. The moth people seem scary at the beginning, but they're actually nice. I hated how the moth people only survived a few days. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. I love how they used nature. They turned the jellyfish into lamps. I really wish they would make a sequel or sequels about where the other people went. That's why I think this book is exciting. Harley W."
5,Beautiful and effectively simple,"This is an extraordinary book. It is written for children, but it appeals as well to adults. Its plot may seem simplistic and childish, but it deftly illustrates the beauty of family and life, prevailing in a survival situation. The setting is imaginative, and while the end leaves you wanting more, the story seems metaphoric for an utopian society. I read this book for the first time in fifth grade, and have been reading this book at least once every other year; it is an enchanting children's story, but every time I read it I gather something more."
5,Sony Cradle vs. iConcept USB Sync Cord,"I wanted to amend an inaccuracy in my review below for the Sony USB Cradle. I mentioned -- erroneously -- that the iConcepts USB Sync Cable does not work since it doesn't have a hot sync button. I just learned that its possible to sync my Clie via the Hot Sync icon in my program menu, and the iConcepts USB Sync Cable works just fine!"
4,Entertaining read,"An Australian soends a few months in St Petersburg, getting to know locals even though she speaks no russian.Mostly about the art world, with reasonably well to do russians, it was a delight to read."
3,"Pretty and handy, but very heavy.","I really like this bag, I just wish it weighed a little less. I've ended up rarely using it because it's too heavy to lug around. I live in NYC and we walk everywhere. It might be handy for use with a car. Great pockets and very nice looking."
4,Cashmere Comfort,Oh so soft cashmere wraps around you with comfort. Great price for a well made scarf. The black is not too intense. The lack of tassels makes this scarf great for long term use. The stuff that gets tangled up in tassels just irritates me because things don't look good for long. This item has worn well.
5,Nature at its best,"This is the best nature series I've ever seen. If you can buy no other series, buy this one. David Attenborough gives you both an overview and a detailed look at plants. If you thought plants were quiet, uninteresting inhabitants of the planet, these films will change your mind. David Attenborough is a very knowledgable guide who knows where to look for things and he has a splendid crew to do the photography worldwide."
1,"Excellent series, crappy format, overpriced.","The Private Life of Plants is a fantastic series, well worth buying.So why the one star review?Because VHS is an outdated format. The same exact series is available on a 2 DVD disk set here:The Private Life of Plants [Region 2] for one tenth the cost (as of this writing).The only problem is that the DVD disks in the link are Region 2/PAL (instead of Region 1/NTSC as is common in the USA) so you might need to use a computer or buy a special player just to play the Region 2 disks."
1,Let's try this...,"If you think H.I.M. are a bunch of MTV goth posers and real goth music is Christian Death, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, My Dying Bride, or Candlemass click ""yes"".If you think that H.I.M. are ""da freekin bestest gawth band eva!!!!!"" along with Evanescence and My Chemical Romance and those awesome bands are posers click ""no""."
3,"3,5 stars","I have to say that i dont like so much this poser style that the singer has. It makes me feel that they are only for little girls. ANyway .... the album has some good songs with the peak : Join me in death + Wicked game which is a very good adaptation. The first 4 -5 songs are good and if you like poser songs then you will love these songs. On the other way (i believe i am an exception) if you like really dark bands like Paradise lost - anathema ... then the best you can feel is that it is just ok. So...... Im between its just ok and i like it - that is for 3,5 stars."
4,PRETTY COOL,"I'M IN TO ALL TYPES OF METAL SUCH AS IN FLAMES, MOONSPELL, TIAMAT, OPETH... STEREOTYPICAL GOTH, BUT I JUST REALIZED HIM AND THEY DON'T EXACTLY FIT INTO MY STYLE BUT THEIR STILL PRETTY COOL. VALOS VOICE IS REALLY TALENTED AND THE GUITAR FITS."
5,best fuxxing cd ever,him is my fave band this c.d. rocks but guess what MY HMV DOSENT SELL THEM. because they have to specal order it and they suck donky wang
1,Pathetic,"A truly pathetic CD. The only good song was ""Right Here In My Arms"". Of course, you might like all of it if you're a suicidal goth, but.. it's not for those who enjoy any part of life or who even tend to avoid stupid lyrics like, ""My sweet 666!"" and ""Join me in death!"" Come ON."
1,"Haven't listened to it, yet","I didn't actually hear any of the songs on this CD. I didn't even take the time to listen to the sample tracks. But I have a strong conviction that heavy metal albums should NOT have any pink on the cover. For this reason only, I refuse to buy the album, and will make fun of anyone who does. Is that a chick on the cover?"
3,Three and a half stars,"I thought this album was pretty good. If you've just heard of HIM, then you might want to start with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. Razorblade Romance is pretty good, I just don't think it's as good as the other cd mentioned. From the cds I've listened to HIM seems to be a good band. I wouldn't call them metal really in this album though.I didn't start listening to HIM because of this BAM guy. I don't really know who he is. Anyway, I think you should give the band a chance."
4,Getting their act together for better subsequent releases,"I've given every HIM album 4 stars. That's how minute the differences in how much I enjoy each one are. I don't think HIM is the greatest band in the world like so many angst riddled teens seem to, but I think they're pretty damn good. This album is probably the least impressive of their CDs that I've heard. That isn't to say it isn't good, it's just not quite as good as Love Metal or Deep shadows and brilliant highlights. Some songs (""your sweet 666"", ""poison girl"" and the cover of ""wicked game"") are just awesomely dark, catchy, and beautifully crafted with HIM's unique style, but some of the other songs (""razorblade kiss"", ""One last time"", and ""Heaven tonight"") just fail to set off that spark of interest that HIM seems so capable of doing so frequently. This album probably isn't the best 1st exposure to HIM, but if you enjoy their style, then by all means add this album to your collection."
5,Find your soul,"This is definately an album worth getting. If you're interested in poetry and bringing it to life, get into Finnish band HIM. Singer Ville Valo battled a hard road to bring his thoughts to fruition. Many people believe HIM is all about devil worship and death, but these rumours need to be deteriorated. HIM is about love and the torture of love as well as its beauty. I know Ville's lyrics have touched people young and old, married and single, from every nation. After all, love makes the world go round!Not all of HIMs music might appeal to you, but at least try it and see, you might be pleasantly surprised. Listen to Ville's poetry and escape into his world for a while. It's beautiful, full of mystery and hope."
1,What the hell is this?,"This is not Goth Metal. This is not even Metal. You want Goth Metal go put on Some Ram-Zet, or even better Darkwell, and Tristania. Or you can even put on some The Sins Of Thy Beloved who are far more Goth. Put on After Forever.You want really Metal go put on Nightwish, Tarot, or even Arch Enemy.This is just the wrost music I have ever heard in my life. This is nothing but an MTV band that stinks.Oh and to the person that said Punk-rockers, skaters, and goths dress in pink, and shop at Hot Topic. Well that may be true to may not be true. But I can tell you one thing you can't call yourself a metalhead."
1,BAD BAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i hate H.I.M they only reason people know of them is because bam margera likes them. they'd be nothing if it weren't for bam. and i wish he didn't like them so they would have never gotten big. THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!
1,hot topic rock,"""I expect you to spout off things like oh its totally (...)"" i never said it was (...), but thanks for reminding me. IT IS (...). and completly devoid of musical depth and persona. Stink 182 has a better guitarist. Simple Plan has a better drummer. and green day has a better singer. and never thought the day would come when i'd say that. holy (...). if you want something with dark lyrics, try alkaline trio, the cure, or atreyu. and yes, i know, atreyu is not heavy metal."
1,LIES,GRILL DONT FIT.NO INSTUCTIONS AVAILIBLE 4 EXPLORER BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT DONT FIT.PROB FIT IF YOU CUT YOUR ORIGINAL GRILL.NOT GOING 2 CHOP MINE UP 2 FIND OUT!!!!!
4,jitsu64,"Tried both watching DVDs and transferring from VHS to DVD. Player worked extremely well in both instances. However, I must agree with earlier reviews that instruction manual could be clearer and more user-friendly. Hookup was easy for me because I just transferred cables from old one to new one but I would have hated for this to be my first one and have to rely on manual."
1,"Great pot, wrong measurements!","Great shape for my Gumbo, wider instead of taller. I love the strainer included and the lid fits fine. Unfortunately, I'm no tracker of algorithms, but this pot measures at 12 quarts not 16. I'm still trying to reach the company."
4,As expected,The dutch oven did everything I expected it to. I would have preferred this item be identified as imported in the description. I thought it was made in the US
2,very brittle material,"got these as it was simpler than replacing the cable for my dvd player in the car, they work okay, but I wasted the first 5 or so by over crimping them and the barrel cracked and broke (I didn't buy the manufacturers crimping tool, just used a standard crimping tool). so a careful balance between under crimping (the connector slides off from the cable) to over crimping (the connector barrel cracks and falls off the cable) - they really could do with a better strain relief mechanism too - as it's too tempting for my kids to pull the cable rather than the connector to detach from the dvd player. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Andy Griffith does Shakespeare,"I confess I got this almost entirely just for Andy Griffith's hysterically funny version of Hamlet. It's extremely dry and sly humor, since his folksy and ever-so-slightly twisted retelling of the tale is delivered as pure cornpone, but most of the humor only makes sense if you're pretty well acquainted with Shakespeare's play."
5,Just as I remembered it!,This brought back sweet memories of growing up listening to Andy tell his stories. I purchased two for gifts and one for me.
3,Works good but there are better options,"You don't need a set of expensive Monster Cables to get a good quality image. This one will get the job done but you can still get higher quality cables for less from places like Monoprice. I have tried Monster, Belkin, and numerous other brands and they all work well."
4,Very Good Cable,Cables are really good i was thinkin of buying one of those high quality cables for may be 3 times what this is worth but this baby right here did the job! so for a less price you can get the same quality to save some money! and spend it on something else like gas...
5,Excellent High Definition Picture,"I have this connected from my PS3 to my Samsung 32"" 1080p tv and the picture is superb. I absolutely love it. No regrets"
4,It works and it is cheao,"I read through the other reviews before I ordered this cable. I had no difficulties with it connecting a Samsung 40"" TV with a TiVo series 3I can recommend it"
5,It just works...,"Stores, in general, will continue to take advantage of these ""new"" cables, charging crazy prices for them. I like Belkin as a brand and was more than happy with the cables so far. They don't feel cheap and both have worked fine since installation.I would buy these again any day!!"
2,AWFUL movie.,"First of all, I'd like to point out the fact that I am a B-movie buff and this movie is definately a B-movie disguised as a mainstream one. It's true that the special effects are great, but the movie itself, well, just plain isn't. I really didn't even like it, though usually I can enjoy some B flicks this one was a tad too stupid. Yeah sure, it had some really funny cheesy scenes but thats the only redeeming quality and then some people don't even enjoy cheeseball humor. This movies about a scientist doing some really idiotic experiment on himself which turns him invisible. Then he abuses his supernatural powers and does some naughty stuff with it. That's it, that's the entire plot. If you're looking for a GOOD B MOVIE, look no further than Evil Dead 2. That one you'll have a blast watching."
2,Terrible film,"A very, very, very poor film. I still remember how terrible this movie was. I only tolerated seeing it because I was with my friends. Besides the extensively long, boring intro...and the slow development of the plot, which couldn't have been more than five sentences long, this movie was ultimately predictable. There was maybe one twist.However, if you are a fan of Kevin Bacon or any other actors/actresses in this film, I have some good things to say about this film. the acting is not bad. I won't say that it was good, but I won't say that it was bad. Second, the special effects in this movie are very good, actually I'd say that they were excellent.This does not mean that I recommend the film. Because sadly, it lacked plot and it lacked interest. the movie was not going anywhere, and I knew what was going to happen in the end, I was just waiting for it to happen."
1,Get the bon fire ready for this one!,"Now, lets start off by saying that Kevin Bacon hasn't made a good movie for twenty years. Second, lets say that a movie solely dependant upon good special effects for the most part turn out for the worst. This is one of those films. I could barely make it through the entire film. A pentagon experiment which aims to be able to succesfully transform a human into an ""invisible"" being goes terribly wrong. The top scientist (Bacon) volunteerd to be the first person to change invisible. Eventually the transformation is a success and Bacon begins to take advantage of his ""invisible"" situation. So, in retrospect, Bacon runs around raping women, killing his friends, and being a total jerk, until they eventually kill him. I think it would be better if this movie was kept ""invisible""."
4,could've been better,This director's cut pretty much contains all of the deleted scenes from the previous edition with only a few other scenes added in.They could've included the two commentaries from the other dvd.I would've liked to see some more new footage as opposed to seeing the old deleted scenes.
2,The Best Comedy of 2000,".....oh wait, it wasn't supposed to be funny! Yeah, so I thought I wrote a review of Hollow Man before, but I can't seem to find it. Any way, Hollow Man is completely Bad, yet it is completely worth watching (hence 2 stars). In 20 years, when the special effects and haircuts look cheesy, it will be pee-your-pants funny. Oh wait, Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue's hair ALREADY looks bad. The script has some very memorable lines including ""I could suck the ---- off of you."" uttered by a slacker scientist looking at pornography on the job (because scientists on top-secret government projects have nothing better to do). Rent this Bad Baby and laugh your pants off."
2,The special effects made the entire movie,"Yup, thats right, the special effects were the only good thing about this movie. They were phenominal the way the made Kevin Bacon and the other animals disapear so seemlessly. However, the story became highly unbelievable once Kevin Bacon became invisible. Like the part towards the end when he and Elizabeth Shue were in the elevator....I mean come on! And when Elizabeth tried to patch up Josh Brolins wounds with duct tape! The first, 45 minutes of this movie were good, but after that, I began to get fidgety in the theater and lost interest quickly. I wish I had waited to rent this movie, I would have saved 8.50......."
2,Can someone please buy Kevin some invisible pants,"This was a film that i was looking forward to. The trailer made the special effects look incredible, and they were. The one thing that i had trouble believing was the actors of this film. Sure Kevin ""I don't like pants"" Bacon can pull of being invisible, but Elizabeth Shue being an action hero, very hard to believe. She looks like she should be in one of those tear inducing Nora Ephron movies, not having to face the invisible man. Joey Slotnick, who we all remember from the sitcom 'The Single Guy' is great in the film, as he is everywhere. But where was he in the film. He had about 7 minutes of screen time. Let him, a real actor battle invisible Kevin. A little note to Kevin Bacon: Just because you like to be naked, does not mean that everyone in this country likes you naked. Buy some invisible pants and keep them on buddy."
4,Take this movie for what it is,"This is considered a ""guy"" movie, that means it has no plot, just a lot of fighting and blood. It may be thin, but it's a movie you can come to time and time again and never get tired of."
2,I usually like Kevin Bacon movies,"I really do like most of Kevin Bacon's movies-but not this time. The ""science"" is insipid-his invisible eyelids can't block the light, but his invisible retina can form an image from his invisible iris. And duct tape is put to marvelous use in this movie as well-enabling a man who has a hole punched in his abdomen by a crowbar to hang from a ladder by one arm while holding his girlfriend with the other. It's also hard to see why Kevin Bacons character becomes nearly invincible once he becomes invisible. The acting if okay in this movie--it's the writers who failed miserably. Ths movie also has several scenes which seem to be there merely to appeal to deviants. I borrowed this dvd to watch it-and I still felt ripped off!"
1,Hollow man left me hollow,"A new twist on the Invisible Man is what I expected when I saw the advertisements for the movie. The plot started out good enough, Kevin Bacon's character, a know it all scientist, has come up with a solution that can turn lab animals invisible. Being the pompus scientict that he is, Bacon's character decides to test the formula on himself and things go straight to hell from there. The special effects were awesome, but the lackluster, sucky (there is NO other word for it) plot made the effort seem waster. In reality I would give the special effects 5 stars and the plot minus 2 stars."
1,A Waste of Two Hours,"At first Hollow Man seemed like it was going to be a good movie. Then it got kind of stupid towards the end. I had kind of enjoyed it until the invisible guy gets tourched and then blown up, and lives. Just because he is invisable doesn't mean he is invincible. It was entertaining until it started to get rediculus. That's all."
2,"Not bad, Not good either...","Okay, I rented this movie because I'm a major sci-fi horror fan, and about five minutes into the movie I was ready to burn the thing! It's awful! FXs are good, and that's the only thing that's good. Bacon's performance is terrible; the plot is dry, old, over-done, and WAY too predictable! This makes its way to number 3 on my top ten WORST films list, and it's BAD! The acting is bad, the story is bad, the usage of the ""F"" word makes even the roughest of sailors want to keel over dead, and the gratuities nudity is disgusting! DO NOT BUY OR RENT! And if you own it, BURN IT! This is simply a good B movie gone bad F- movi!"
3,Certainly a Film For Aficionados of Visual Wizardry,"Remove MAN from this movie's title. What remains sums up the stock characters and thin plot tossed into a screenplay overflowing with complicated descriptions of effects, sounds and stunts. Although those complicated descriptions made their transition to film and soundtrack beautifully, better films of this genre sparkle with a near-perfect balance of dramatic narrative and effects. HOLLOW fails in this aspect of solid storytelling. For its visual aspect (and feature films must first and foremost be more visual than dialogue oriented), HOLLOW MAN passes with the highest marks."
1,UGH!,"If you have read my reviews for other dvd titles (Scream Trilogy Set, The Birds, Vertigo), you have probably come to know I write long reviews. But this is not to be the case. I will inform you that this is THE MOST wretched piece of FILTH two hour waste of ANY DECENT HUMAN BEINGS TIME it's laughable. I'll put it to you this way: They should show it to prisoners for PUNSIHMENT! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE run in the other direction when you think of buying this. I just surely hope that my seeing this film and being tortured for two hours will not be in vain. I hope that some poor soul will NEVER have to cringe because of this CRAP again. Thank you, I have said my piece, and good night."
1,wake me when its over,"my best advice regarding this film, is that if you have a functioning brain, it may not be by the end.boring pointless bacon vehicle.I expect more from Paul Verhoeven, its almost a travesty to mention robocop and starship troopers alongside this."
2,Hollow Movie,"The question that comes to mind here is: Why bother? The storyline offers nothing really new. Scientist with no ethics invents a drug that makes creatures invisible (and thinks he has another to reverse the process). He tries it out on himself (why?), becomes invisible, then goes berserk. In the end, he is killed several times, but keeps reappearing to the point of ridiculousness (and haven't we all seen that one a few times before?) in true superhuman fashion. Presumably gets done in at last (but who knows for sure?). Kevin Bacon isn't bad as the mad scientist, and the special effects are truly special, but the story is predictable and lame from beginning to end. There really is no reason to see, much less own, this unless you have a compulsion about maintaining your complete collection of ""invisible man"" flicks."
2,"Good try, but I'd rather it was an erotic thriller","Hollow Man was on its way to being a good, albeit trashy, science fiction thriller when it was as if the idea train derailed. Let me explain.The film starts with great special effects. First, the ape is returned to the visible and then Kevin Bacon is made invisible. These were incredibly cool moments. What follows is a masterpiece of erotic filmmaking as Bacon sneaks around molesting a few women and terrorizing others. This was an ultimate voyeuristic moment and made the movie worth watching.However, instead of continuing in this vein. The invisible Bacon returns to the lab to murder his co-workers. The film becomes a stupid, over the top bloodbath. It becomes the kind of film where characters take crowbars to the head and aren't really hurt. Stupid not suspensful, and unexciting.Its too bad the director chickened out of a great erotic film idea."
1,standard horror,i was expecting alot better. this flim is boring you can guess whos going to get killed and when the big scares are coming up.oh well a least the premise was a bit differnt than most.
3,The Invisible Man Returns....and returns....and returns,"As I'm sure has been pointed out, this is a good update, through better technology of transformation, of The Invisible Man, who first made his appearance in talkies in the 1930's. Never before have we seen the anatomy of appearance and disappearance so vividly. Once the protagonist is invisible, it looked like we were going to veer into soft, if not hard, porn but, unfortunately, it was violence not sex, which got the go-ahead from the director, and the film settled into a repeat of Friday 13th and similar Drive-In Theater clambakes. Of course, that still leaves it with a large potential audience (given when this is being written, I should say, gave it a large potential audience). If you are one who likes that sort of thing, you should like this one. As for me, I will forgo the pleasures of Hollow Man 2."
2,"All effects, no story, no acting","The only redeeming feature of this movie are the excellent special effects. The story is almost non-existant, and you are constantly shown ho-hum outbursts by Bacon's moody character. His acting isn't at all impressive, although his part in the movie doesn't allow for him to be. For that matter, the acting of Elisabeth Shue isn't any good, either. None of the acting is. And there are many technical questions I have and think are funny. For example, when injected with the invisible liquid, the people miracuously disappear from the outside and it works its way in towards the internal organs and bones. But, when injected in the same vein with the reappearing agent, they strangely begin reappearing from the inside then moving outward. That's just one example of the many horrible scenes of the movie, although the rendition of the body as it is disappearing/reappearing is excellent."
4,Nice!,"Kurtis calls all wanna be Mantronik(X) to task on this CD. He rightfully returns to reclaim his title as the King of The Beats! Push your hands up is the highlight of this CD. Buy this one, you will not be disappointed by this effort from Kurtis."
4,has Gladys's talent all over it,I was also surprised to learn that Gladys does not sing the vocals except on a couple of tracks. This is an excellent addition to any Christmas CD collection. Gladys's talent and gift for music come through in every number she produces and it's refreshingly easy and satisfying to listen to. We've been playing it everyday since we received it and haven't grown tired of the vocals. Even to hear Gladys sing one of the Christmas songs is well worth buying the CD. The Choir is outstanding and the chosen vocalists are varied and good. Worth buying!
3,Gladys does not sing on this c.d.,"Buyer beware. Although Gladys is on the cover, she mainly produced and arranged the album for All Saints Choir. She does talk in the intro and you can hear her voice sometimes. The album is well done with the choir so it is not a complete waste of money but they should be on the cover NOT Gladys."
1,Misleading,"This Bible is only 3 books, and is very difficult to transition through. It would be great if a woman's Bible contained all the books, and offered a devotional."
2,Not the complete Bible,"I was very disappointed in this. I thought I was getting the complete Bible, but many books are missing. Some of the commentary was good, but I was looking for something I could read from Genesis to Revelation, but not all the books are there."
2,not a woman's bible,I think the author of this book should have titled it (there's nothing good about women in the bible). I wanted to learn and understand more of God's word not read a hate review of his word.
3,The Woman's Bible,I found the book was easy to read. I am still reading it but so far I have really enjoyed The Woman's Bible. Hope you all like it.
1,Look at the Reviews First,"I should have looked at the reviews first. This isn't really a bible. I thought it was when I found that I couldn't navigate to any particular book or chapter and verse. I fiddled with it for a while before I realized this is like a commentary but not on the whole bible. It's free, but don't waste your time."
1,Not a Bible for women,This is not a Bible for women but is instead a book written by a feminist on sections of the Bible that mention women. I would not recommend this to anyone. I deleted this from my kindle.
5,A Classic Work,"A good, logical discussion of the Bible passages pertaining to women. Even tho this old work takes the premise that the Bible actually has some historicity to it (there is a very poor correlation to actual history and archaeology), it shows just how illogical and misogynistic the male interpretation of woman's role is. It also shows how totalitarian the morals are shown to be in the Bible. Like Mark Twain's writings on the same subject but without any concentration on woman's role, the Bible does not stand up well to any logical analysis.The brainwashed true believers who never let logic, evidence, or reason stand in the way of their authoritarian beliefs give this a 1 star. It would be interesting to do the same treatment with a 100 years additional information to add to the discussion. That would really anger the fundies."
3,Arduous read,"A long arduous read, but I did learn a lot in this book by my famous ancestor. Interesting to read non-fiction work from the close of the 19th century when so much was changing for women."
1,Do Not Read,"This is not a true Bible, The auther takes certain excerpts from the Bible and illistrates her DILUTED opinion. I am a christian and have been for all my life and I have never been to dis-heartened by what I read in the first few pages of this book. To christians it is appauling and to new believers, it will be detrimental. In my opinion, this book should not be published for anyone to read, Shame on this publisher!"
1,Warning,"This bible is a new age book and not the Word of God. Twists scripture to form untruths. If you are a Christian, this ""bible"" is not for you....dangerous"
1,Beware of Freebies.,"Very poor interpretation attempt. Hard to read, hard to chronicle. Deleted it almost the same day."
2,confusing,I bought this bible for a study guide and it was really confusing did not start with Genesis like it should have my old NIV was much more usefull. Don't know why I thought a Women's Bible would be more usefull but it wasn't. Fortunately it was cheap. Got what I paid for
1,No functionality whatsoever,"This reads exactly like a book...You aren't able to access the individual books of the Bible or do any searches. All you can do is hit the next page and it takes forever to get out of the Prefaces and Author comments. This is all well for those who want to go from next page to next page, but if you want access to Revelation...it's going to take you a long time to get there."
1,ABSOLUTE TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"no WAY should this be advertised as a Bible! the TRUE Bible is the inspired word of God, NOT mankind's work. it may not, shall not, can not conform to fit your political views! take your liberal feminist ideas somewhere else."
2,Hard to navigate through,This amazon bible is okay sort of hard to navigate through compared to other bible applications and Amazon bibles that I have purchased.
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for a simple daily bible study which can be easily read. This is not what I expected.
5,"Excellent critique of the Bible, continues to be relevant today",This is an excellent critique of the Bible written by one of feminisms founding mothers. Recommended for all as a great read.
3,Overloaded and overwhelming,"Massive amounts of information. At times long-winded and difficult to read. Don't look for any sample recipes although they do periodically give a ""uses"" paragraph(s). They are definitely more for the academic rather than the foodie -- one look at the table of contents will convince you of this. Sample entry: ""The Question of Paleolithic Nutrition and Modern Health: From the End to the Beginning"". One's simple question may be deluged with a tremendous amount of information. That aside, they are very good reference books. Very informative and very seriously written. The books are divided into ""Parts"" and, within the Parts, ""Chapters"". Very good bibliography for each chapter. The index was very helpful however, since the index is in volume 2 and a topic can be in volume 1, it can get a little unwieldy. I would recommend the Oxford Companion to Food for a little more simplicity."
3,anxiously awaiting !!!,"I bought this Dvd(not a Book !!) for the video i remember on mtv ,of goody two shoes"" song with the secretary that lets her hair down,looks really hot after she loosens up,and Michelle H,who ever you are/ why did you say book? this is clearly a video !!!"
1,Do NOT buy this from Amazon,"Took me more than 2 weeks to receive this TV, which was fine. However, it's not working from minute one--the huge thing just would not turn on!! I went through all the trouble--calling panasonic customer service, calling the local servier, calling another local servier since the first one insisted that I bring this TV over to their store, which is against the in-home service warranty. Finally someone came and picked it up. But the communication between the local servicer and Panasonic is still gonna take some time and I don't know what would be the agreement between them.I suspect that Amazon sold us an used TV (when I told the repair guy this thought, he said ""that explains the damage"").We ordered the TV on Aug 21, and today (Sept 12)I am still waiting, hoping that it will come back and be OK. So if you take my lesson, go to local circuit city or bestbuy. Just don't buy from Amazon."
3,Not his best work,"I really wanted to like this book, but it was slow going from start to finish. I found myself not really caring about the characters and their contrived predicaments. A few hours' reading took me almost a week to finish.Having said that, the language is still as beautiful as ever. Wodehouse is always putting words in uncommon situations. For example, someone will ""trouser"" an item, or instead of screaming shrilly, he will say ""she shrilled."" A wonderful way to expand one's vocabulary.But all in all, this book failed my acid test of a Wodehouse novel: I didn't laugh out loud once."
5,I'm not talking about playing tennis,"I read this book a few years ago, and it radically changed my life. The first book that I ready written by Chuck was The Grace Awakening, and my eyes truly were opened and my mind enlightened, as to how very easy it is to be legalistic and judgmental. In reading Improving Your Serve, I felt smaller and smaller, and realized how Big God really is and what it really means to ""be like Jesus."" Thanks Chuck, your books The Grace Awakening, and Improving Your Serve, have done for me what being at church Sunday after Sunday was not able to accomplish. In reading these two books in particular, I realized that being a writer is a powerful tool to use as a witness to the truth of Jesus Christ. Continue to operate in this ministry wisely. May God's blessings continue to be on your ministry."
3,a good workout,"eric nies is quite motivational for anyone to work out. The music was great and the dance moves fun. The video is not one you can grow with, though. After a few times, it lacks challenge to your heart rate or muscle growth."
1,It is horrible,"The video is a really stupid video. It lasts for about an hour and you barely get a workout. You just follow the same dance over and over for an hour, how boring. I thought the combination was so easy and the video is really stupid. I would not suggest it to anyone. I used it once and I don't think I will ever use it again. What a waste of money."
4,Adam Ant Movie Lover,"How did a movie with Hopper, Pare and Adam Ant get missed at the theater? I bought this movie because I'm an avid Adam Ant fan who wants to see all his movies. This one suprised me becuase it wasn't just good, but I'd never heard of it before. A definite must for any fan of the above but especially for me as an Adam Ant fan."
2,The charging lead connector is not very durable,"Sure the cradle is fine for synching/recharging but after about 16 months of use, the charging lead did not make a clean connect with the cradle interface (or directly with the clie). I had to take apart the charging interface and force the pins out a little more then try and tape it all back together. I have to do this every month now since the pins gradually retract.It's the only fault I've had in using the Sony Clie but I'll prob have to get a full cradle replacement becuase of it."
1,Guaranteed Tough. Hah!,"I bought these gloves because I have found DeWalt tools reliable and durable (I own 15 DeWalt tools in all). After three days of moderate use, the seams began to come apart, and after a week the gloves were useless. I sent the gloves to DeWalt and they just told me that they don't make them, and put me in touch with the manufacturer. Save your money, and buy own brand gloves from Home Depot or Lowes. They cost less and last longer."
4,buy these for gifts...,co worker contractors like them..once again a yellow glove to spot easy in dark warehouses or work areas// good fit
2,Comfortable but Didn't Last Long,"The Dewalt gloves have a nice feeling leather along with the spandex backing makes this a very comfortable glove. The palms are durable and didn't show signs of tearing even after lifting bricks, branches, and bamboo.However, I bought these just 5 months ago (used them every weekend), and now the tip of the middle finger on my left glove has a big ole tear in it. Granted, I'm not sure if these gloves were designed for gardening, where the gloves get wet and are in the dirt a lot.I was disappointed that they tore, so I'm going to try the synthetic leather ones instead. They got a better review rating and they're cheaper."
4,Good movie for fans of Oyama,"This movie traces the life of Choi Baedal, a Korean who learns to prove himself in the martial arts world of post-WWII Japan. Loosely based on the life of Mas Oyama (Sosai), founder of Kyokushin Karate, it is an enjoyable watch, especially for those who practice Kyokushin. It is not, however, all fighting and training. A fair amount of the film focuses on Baedal's life before training in the mountains, including a love interest.The movie is in both Korean and Japanese. English subtitles are available. The only downside is that in the options submenu, the languages are not labeled in in English, so I have to fish around to see which of the five subtitled languages is English (I think it's the third).On the whole a good movie."
2,Daffy Duck and Company,"I've have ""The Dover Boys"" and ""The Hep Cat"" on the Looney Tunes Volume 2 DVD."
3,Buyer,"Looks Gorgeous. Sounds good.Construction is below expectations.Mechanics of the metal lever connecting the top are shakey and more difficuly than it should be.Volume control is AWFUL. It's a wobbly plastic knob. Digital so you click it left or right, not smooth turning like the tuning button.Plastic foundation for vinyl record and the needle bar are wobbly. Do not have feel of quality.Looks great sounds good. Wish it had an aux plug."
3,Ink Jet Ink,"Sadly, ink jet printing is still relatively expensive. You can typically buy a budget model printer for not more than the cost of new cartridges... That's an odd world to live in, considering the raw materials for the cartridges are cheaper. But, that's the ink racket.These are performing as expected."
1,How this was suggested to me is a mystery.,This is in the top 100 worst films of all time. I didnt even read the cartoon inwhich it was bsed on.
4,Finally!,"Well it's about time this gets a DVD! By no means the greatest movie of our times, but it's hilarious, it's well formulated cheese, and it's so much fun to watch. I remember this being one of the 7 movies HBO had it rotation back in the day and watched it every chance I got when I was young. Yeah for Howard!"
3,Entertaining and a bit out there,"Come on! Howard Duck was fun and a bit wacky. Yes, this out-of-space duck was bit horny, a bit of a coward, and completely psychotic but, at least all of this was funny. My favorite thing is just watching the duck run, as hard as he may try, he just can't go that fast. A bit sadist yes, but funny. The ""love"" story side of the movie may have been a bit too much. A bit too out there and unlikely...but hey, it's sci-fi! The movie is entertaining. If I were flipping through channels and stumbled across it, I would certainly stop and watch it."
4,don't listen to the naysayers,"this movie has comedy, action, drama, and a touch of sci-fi monster mayhem to keep anyone with some imagination entertained. besides lea thompson is hot, and she sings pretty good too. hell if you like back to the future, teen wolf, weird science, breakfast club, and short circuit you'll like this. just sit back and laugh its really well done."
3,No sense of humor,"This movie is like Hudson Hawk in that the people who call it stupid appear so humorless in their attacks.I had no idea this was a comic first, but this movie made me laugh. It's pretty darn stupid in a funny way and it has some serious laugh-out-loud moments.Jeffrey Jones (principal from Ferris Buehler) can make me laugh just by appearing, so maybe I'm biased but this movie is still pretty funny.I can't wait until it comes out on DVD."
4,howard the duck,this movie should be considered classic. there is no other movie like it.it should be put onto dvd a.s.a.p. if it were i would rate it a 4 star.
3,Surprised fanboy,"Years ago Howard the Duck comics were one of the hottest titles out there, with books selling for high prices almost as soon as they came out. When we heard about the movie, no internet back then so just word in some movie mags, all of us fanboys were excited (remember this is a time with almost no movies based on comics). A friend and I saw the movie and loved it, we came out of the theater sure that this was going to be a summer blockbuster. Next day we read the reviews and overnight we saw the end of Howard the Duck's popularity. Looked like my friend and I were the only 2 people in the world who liked the film. Saw it on cable a while ago and I still liked it. It's a fun silly movie based on a comic that was fun and silly. Forget all the negatives and just enjoy it for what it is, a silly entertaining romp. Lea Thompson has never been cuter, Jeffery Jones does his usual excellent job, and a chance to see Tim Robbins when he was just a goofy kid."
1,money back,"It didn't finish downloading so I deleted it, and I DIDN'T get my money back! I would like to have my $10 back so I could use it on something else!"
1,Worst Movie of all Time!!!!!!!!!!!!,"How can anyone think this movie was good, or worse, cry. It was painful to watch it. This is by far the worst movie ever written. Worst plot in Hollywood history"
4,Howard Lives on!,I have to agree that it's about time it's on DVD. I grew up with this movie and to this day highly enjoy it. Movies from back then aren't what they are today but it's still nice to be able to get a hold of a movie you grew up with and share it with your kids.
2,Not a movie for children,"As campy or dumb funny as some might consider this cult flick, it's definitely less child-safe than the PG rating and title would imply. There are depictions of duck breasts (like human breasts with feathers), alcoholism, near constant violence, implied bestiality (between the duck alien and a human girl), etc. The film takes all these elements too seriously for you to write it off as knowingly stupid.. making it just.. stupid.The special effects were mildly impressive, but given how George Lucas helped out in the making of the film, could you have expected anything less? Perhaps this film was the first mainstream warning that Lucas wasn't good for anything else besides THX and Industrial Light and Magic anymore. Next to the Star Wars Christmas Special of course."
5,HOWARD COME BACK!,"I am finally standing up for this movie, I have had heard enough flack about this movie, it is one of my favorites, sure, no plot, the acting could have been better, and the writing could use some work, but, LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! ,To quote the great Duckie from Pretty In Pink ""It's called a sense of humor, you should get one they're nice"", what were you expecting when you saw this, Ghandi? Lighten up and give this movie another chance.P.S.: Mr. Lucas, if you are reading this, HOWARD THE DUCK 2! , think about it :)"
3,So-So,"I couldn't really get into this book. While I chuckled at some of the stories (like the muffler bearings story), other times I thought the book delved into the sugary-sweet. As an example the two and a half pages taken up to spin the tale of her date with a present day driver. Another time she writes how dressing femininely works for you in business dealings. Huh? This book seems to be an extension of What Southern Women Know with Nascar thrown in. I don't think we're getting a good picture of life in the pits. There is Ms. Rich's side of pit life, and there is the grease under your fingernails and a motor roaring in your ears side. I would've liked a view from both sides. Perhaps it is because I've read Dale Jr's and Tony Stewart's books that Ms. Rich's book is a bit of a disappointment."
5,A Great Beginning,"This shows how it all started... This pilot episode of I Love Lucy is very funny. But, the interviews with the creators and stars of I Love Lucy make it even better. It also is hosted by Lucie Arnaz, who does a wonderful job."
1,prongs get stuck,"I would not recommend this. I had one (unknown brand, but researching now, think might be Monopol) that I bought at the Mondavi Shop probably over a decade ago. It served me well. Unfortunately, i lost it. this was supposed to be its replacement, but the prongs are so thick that it has pushed in many a cork. Aaargh. Don't buy this. Not worth the aggravation."
5,The Ah-Soo cork opener,"Great! It preserve the cork and I know it will work well with older bottles. A must for your cellar. I should have been told earlier, no more pieces of cork in my wine. I used to use a coffee filter to screen broken cork!"
4,Good overview of DoD distributed simulation,This book is not for simulation developers. It is a book for someone who is new to the DoD modeling and simulation industry and needs to understand the big picture. The 36 page glossary is a plus.
3,Great food set except...,"Okay, the food that came with this set is very realistic and my daughter could play with this stuff in her kitchen for hours, BUT...the yogurt container was crushed and unusable when I received it. I'm STILL waiting on that replacement product. This is an expensive food set, so I was not pleased to receive it damaged. However, the rest of the food seems to be durable. My daughter has a blast identifying the various foods and serving them up to her family, friends, and teddy bears--great for the imagination! Despite the yogurt container, I still feel this is a quality food set and I'm happy I bought it."
5,High Quality,"You pay a little more for these, but it's well worth it. It's a lot more realistic than the others I have seen on the market."
5,Amazing Play Food!,I have purchased many of the Learning Resources Food Baskets. They are all AWESOME! They look realistic and are high quality. Best play food that you can buy!
2,Who typset the math in this thing?,"I realize that this is a layman's version of the theory, but couldn't someone at the publisher really take the time to typeset the equations correctly? They don't make any sense and they aren't set up right.Also, although this is translated from Einstein's German version, there are books that better explain his theory of Relativity. He wasn't all that good at it. However, it is an inexpensive alternative for my research."
1,No Sound for Arrival,"I was dissapointed at being unable to hear the movie. There was no audio to the movie, hence, I was unable to view it. I gave it a couple of opportunities by giving it some time and even switching tv's but it was all a no go! At this time I can't give a review to a movie I was not able to hear. The picture was okay, for what it's worth."
4,"Zane, Alien Inspector Clouseau",Zane the astronomer finds an alien signal. Then he finds aliens that look like humans. Then he uncovers plot of aliens to destroy the environment. Then he makes a sweet tape and broadcasts it to the world and now all of earth knows about the aliens. Then the movie ends.
2,"Fun plot, bad acting","This was an ok movie: a decent plot, fairly enjoyable, plot twists I didn't expect, but the acting wasn't really that great. Charlie Sheen was just over-the-top, I expected more from him. If you want a good alien invasion movie, ""Independence Day"" is MUCH better than this. If you want a good ""contact from outer space"" movie, ""Contact"" blows this one out of the water."
3,Where's The PLOT?,"Arrival was well constructed and had a plot or at least a basic plot. The acting was very well done. Now; as for Arrival 2, it would have been best for them (writers)to have remained back in another galaxy far far far away. Patrick has done much better work in the past. The visual effects were well (the scene where Patrick attempts to smash through the locked glass doors has a sense of humor. The glass door had obviously been scared! The glass door is cracked and ready to shatter before it is assaulted by Patrick's panicking throw. (Film editors miss) The writer could learn a little something from successful screen writers of such films as Alien and it's follow ups or the nightmare on Elm streets (excluding part 2 the worst). Keeping with the original story line and still able to make it a completely separate individualized movie worthy of its predecessor. Well better luck next time if you dare. It really had potential of becoming a brilliant successor. Write and learn."
3,arrival/arrival 2 pretty good,i must say that after reading the reviews of the other people that have seen these movies i thought both movies were going to suck. i have to said that they did not suck. everybody put down arrival 2 and i think that arrival 1 and 2 were very good. the special effects were good and the story lines were very good. i would recommeded people to see both movies. they are both worth watching.
4,The Arrival,"Very cool movie, I reccomend it to anyone that likes a little sci-fi thriller with a little funny stuff mixed in"
4,Keeps you on the edge of your seat!,This a a 3.5 star flick; entertaining but not the most believable. The bad guys would have the technology and personnel investment to ensure Charlie would not be able to penetrate them and survive as he does - but the writing and action are good enough to bear the glitch. The plot is compelling. You are sort of left wondering what happens next.
1,This The World's Worst-ever Sci-Fi Movie,This the most god-awful movie I have ever seen. The plot was just short of non-existent and the acting was downright pitiful. How anyone could have liked this movie (see other reviews) is a mystery to me.
1,Arrival II ...BARF!!!,"If Patrick Muldoon wasn't bad enough in this stinker they gave him Jane Sibbett to ""act"" with. She would be out of her league in a school play.Stay away from this one if you want to keep your lunch down."
3,Not bad for an older movie,"If your into aliens and so on, you will like this video. Was given as a gift."
3,Still missing the LaserDisc extras!,"A great SF film, and great to have it in BluRay. But where are the special features (e.g., alternate ending, commentaries, etc.) that were on the LaserDisc? I thought BluRays were supposed to have more content, not less!"
3,A decent Sci-Fi paranoia flick...,"I watched this one in the theaters and was one of the few in the seats during the first weekend. It disappeared a few weeks later. Again, I enjoyed the film and enjoyed it for what the company had to spend on to make it. Don't expect no big Wows and bangs here. It's just good cheap cinema."
1,How could you even review it?,"We have purchased three copies of this DVD and all three shared the identical defect--there is no sound in the first and last acts of the movie. We have even rented it and found the rental DVD to have the same defect. The first time I bought it was maybe 8 years ago. Then I bought it used--same flaw. Recently my husband bought another copy and guess what? No sound.So what are you all reviewing?It's just hard to believe that the flaw was never corrected. Too bad, because I love the rest of the movie, but am sad to say I have never seen it in its entirety."
2,"Not so great, but pretty colors","I tried/own both the pink and the orangish colors and both work the same way. It is true that it goes on smooth and easy. You apply it with the pen and then smear it over your lips with your finger tip. However, the color wipes off easily even after letting it dry for over 15 minutes. I kept doing tests to see how long you had to leave it on before it would not wipe off, but even my 30 minute test did not work. The color still wipes off. I'm disappointed because the colors are really pretty but the stuff just won't stay put. I have to keep reapplying it all day long. I bought the two colors because the product came so highly recommended by Alive magazine, but just goes to show you that you can't believe everything you read."
1,Lester Cheetah from Cheeto snacks would have been proud !!!!,"this movie really has the cheese that goes CRUNCH!!!!!. its so lamely cheesy, its so bad it stays bad, with never a chance to turn good. the ninja costumes look like the were purchased at toys r us. not to mentioned the evil ninjas helmet its a copy of the splinter cell helmet.the acting is the pits. to the fake screams, to gestures, everything is acted out of place. the story is just boring. badly edited, theres a part were a helicopter just vanishes out of nowhere. . the fighting was bad, i cant recall a single second of this movie that caught my attention. if you are thinking about buying this movie, just flush the money down the toilet. at least some sewer rats will benefit from it."
2,Don't waste your time!,Don't buy this movie! Waste of time and money!There are hundreds of martial arts movies better than this one! Wish I had bought something else!
2,"COOL cover!, BAD Ninja film!","I ONLY gave this movies 2 stars instead of 1 because of the cover!! OK, is not bad as Black Ninja but is certainly NOT good as Ninja Assassin.First of all, this is not exactly a ninja film, is more like a karate film. The good guy is always fighting the bad guys with his modern clothes until the ending when he decides to dress up as a ninja (the one in the cover) so he can fight the bad ninja. The only ninja that fights during the entire film is the bad armored ninja that kills a couple of good guys with his stealth sword and pistols.Of course, the fights were so-so, the acting was terrible, and the story was predictable.The only goodies of this movie are the blood and gore (which was kind of cool)and the fight at the end with the two ninjas fighting other bad guys and themselfs. Note: The final fight scene wasn't THAT long.P.S: In my opinion, this movie is very similar to the Transporter movies but without car chases, less budget, and with a ninja concept."
3,Not quite as good as I was expecting.,"I love Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee. I have a lot of experience with it. I thought this would be as good as it usually is. While good, it wasn't anywhere near as good as I was expecting it to be. At least it was much cheaper than the stuff I get at the local market."
2,Way too mild,"This stuff is supposed to be primo. Was one of the mildest, least flavorful coffees I've tasted."
3,WOW!,"What can I say. If you have never read Bucky Fuller, DO NOT start with this one. That was my mistake. It was a good technical manual of his concepts of this spaceship earth and his idea on ecologically sound architecure. However, it gets convoluted and overly technical. I tell you what! If you want to read a book that can make you feel ignorant no matter how eductated you are, this is the book for you. Fuller was an amazing man and great thinker, but it would be best to start out with something a little less technical."
1,Don't buy this Blondie CD,"I was contemplating buying this one versus ""The Best of Blondie."" which was released in 1981. I assumed this one being released in 1999 was better quality, but boy was I wrong. The audio quality is horrible. I love Blondie but this is not the right CD to buy. I agree with the other reviewer's suggestion of purchasing the other ""The Best of Blondie"" released in 1981 or Parallel Lines."
2,Buyer beware!,I bought this for my parakeets and was really excited about getting this. The package arrived in a timely manner. Thanks goodness I had someone who knows how to fix things because some of the wooden parts did not match up to put in the holes. The perches are slippery so I went out and bought sandpaper covers to cover them with. The birds are much happier now that they aren't slipping off! Sorry but this was a disappointment!
5,Very cool!!!!!!!,"This DVD Rocks, it contains all the goals of the 2006 WORLD CUP And The Way its Done, Its Really A Highlight Film Of The Whole Tournament. It was a great world cup and thankfully France did not win and even better ITALY WON. The extras are the top 10 goals and the top ten saves. This is an exciting must have for world cup fans."
2,You will probably not find this review helpful,"Ok, so call me shallow, but I guess I tried to watch this movie a couple years ago, and I found it again the other day on my DVD shelf. I could not figure out how it got there or why I didn't remember much of it. Well, I figured it out pretty quickly. The female lead looks like she forgot to take off ghoul makeup and put on wrinkle cream or any other makeup. I mean seriously she looks so weathered that it pretty much ruins the movie, which otherwise is generally entertaining. I would have preferred looking at a fat lady for 90 minutes to looking at the lines all over her face."
5,Peaceful Dance,Today there are so many dance/techno titles that it is like searching through a field for a four leaf clover to find a soothing and refreshing peaceful trance song. I happened to pick up a various hits cd at a local store here in the U. S. and this smooth rythmic melody was there. The sound is enchanting and makes the listener want to listen over and over again. Good job Alena -excited to hear more from this artist.
4,Scandal at the Oak Beach Inn,"A very interesting book about Long Island New York governments and some of the people who take part in the ""protection"" of its people. Glad I moved myself and business out! The truth lie somewhere in the middle, but it is good to hear from the underdog. I have fond memories of the OBI. It really was an iconic establishment. Just sorry that future generations were protected so well. It will be missed."
1,Where is Roy Scheider's wonderful narration?,"Do not buy this DVD!!! Buy the VHS copy instead. It is extremely important to note that something very weird has happened to Roy Scheider's original and wonderful narration to this film -- on this DVD the narration is either performed by some flat and dead voiced wannabe, or something has gone terribly awry with the audio quality of the narration. Whatever it is, it is not like the original version. You have been warned."
4,"""Tracie's Comeback Album is a Success!""","I have been a Tracie Spencer fan since I first heard ""Make the Difference"". I was so impressed that I got her first album ""Tracie Spencer"" and I was still equally impressed with her dynamic vocal skills. Her latest effort, ""Tracie"" is no exception. The albums head-boppin' beats along with her melodic voice makes this album probably one of the best comeback albums of the year. My only problem with the album is that it lacks strong ballads that fans have come to expect and love hearing from her. I personally felt that her vocal range past songs such as ""Imagine"" and ""Love Me"" were missed with the ballads on this latest album. However, Tracie Spencer still has a winner here with ""Tracie"" . I am for one elated to see and hear her back on the music scene! GOD bless you, Tracie, and keep up the excellent work."
4,GREAT CD BUT BAD PROMOTION,"Tracie Spencer was one of the most favorite female R&B artist of the early ninties. I never cared for her previous albums but I love this album. Too bad the album got little promotion just like Tevin Campbell and Shanice's albums that were released that same year. Tracie hooked up with producers ""Soulshock & Karlin"" which I think she was dating one of them at the time. It's rare that you find a album where you could listen to every song. This album is very nice and I would recommend buying it."
5,Tracie's Return To music,"I remember this album when I was 12. I love this CD. It's hot. The album is filled with jeep-styled jams and heartfelt ballads. This is her coming-of-age album. This album showcases her musical skills in a truly contemporary setting. This album should have been promoted more. Remember,this was 1999."
1,Incomplete Item (Remote Missing),"Item shipped to me without a Remote. I have contacted Amazon Warehouse and am awaiting their response, but as of now: I'm not very happy"
3,Not so deep,"This is considered one of the most important essays among geographers, and being a geographer myself, i actually thought of this book (before buying it) as the one everyone involved in this subject should read.I have to say that while it is very well written, poetic and strong it doesn't really add anything specific to the community. I found it just a collection of many themes and ideas touched and developed by others in the past. Don't get me wrong, the book is beautiful and thanks to its fluidity it's a pleasure to read it, but it is more of a global vision of things ."
4,Refreshing entry,"Very nice ""Charity work"" by Gary Brooker for his local church. Good sound concidering the size of the church. Great Choir!I'm not too keen on the Gospel music bits, but you have to concider the location, I suppose. I had a lot of trouble understanding his spoken introductions, too. His composition ""Within Our House"" is strangely out of his vocal range, but it, still, is a beautiful song."
4,every social scientist should read this book,There are few books that are as honest as this and show the emperor in his true clothes. for years we have had to put up with a load of crap now we can say what we believe. Well done.
4,Carl Dreyer's creepy vampire mystery,"Carl Dreyer, one of Scandinavia's finest directors, brought this film to the screen in 1932. It is image driven, with not a lot of dialog. Dreyer creates a number of scenes, with the atmosphere raised to the peak, with scary music playing throughout the film. We see Allan, an occult researcher staying at a house. He sees some very scary, werid things there. It seems vampires are controlling the people there, and it is up to him to save them, destroy the vampire, and escape. We follow him investigating the gothic home, with images of death in every room. In one scene he dreams of his own burial! We don't see much of the vampire though, mostly the haunting effects it has on the residents. This film is really creepy, and atmospheric. I'd recommend it highly to those who enjoy the old style, slow, spooky, gothic horror films. 4 stars."
1,BORING,"In a word - BORING. A total waste of money, viewing time and celluloid.By far the worst vampire movie I've seen. Totally uninteresting, devoid of interest and barely watchable - the acting is such that ham sandwiches could be made from it. The previous review summed up my view re: transfer to DVD.Go elsewhere if you want to experience the genre"
1,Pretentious,"I love to read, and I was very excited when I saw this book. I thought it would be an etheral story of the thinning of the veil between our World and the other side. I am almost halfway through and I just cannot keep reading. I feel like the author is trying so hard to show her skill at beautiful prose that she forgets her story. It's boring, very confusing, and unfortunately did not live up (for me) to the wonderful painting used on the cover. Being a wonderful writer is one thing, but there is not a gripping story here."
3,Beautifully written,"This was certainly an interesting book. Truly, it was beautifully written and captured what seemed to be an entire town for the early summer. The meanderings about the nature of the world somewhat slowed down the action and because it didn't really delve too deeply into any of the characters' lives, it didn't seem like a very modern book. I did like the sections that followed the P.O.V. of the dogs in particular. While I did enjoy it, I don't think I would pick up just any of her other books, but I suppose I would keep an eye out for them... without any sense of urgency, however.It reminded me, somewhat, of Leif Enger's writing, but only in the careful construction of sentences."
2,Strange,"The story in this novel is rather oddball but in an interesting way. It keeps you wondering where it's going...and really, in the end, I wasn't all that satisfied as to where it took me. It seemed to end abruptly, and, for most of the characters, not at all well, so actually I felt like maybe the town these folks lived in was cursed, as there were no good endings for anyone, from the 1800s schoolmarm on up to the present day characters. What I did like was the unusual format, the chapters emitting different voices, even a dog's! I give it only two stars because if I wouldn't read it again, that's the rating it gets, and I wouldn't read it again. I will definitely pass it on to my reading friends, though."
4,Lasting Power,This film is just as exciting and thrilling as when first released. A true tribute to Madonna and her super special dancers.
3,Flawed Portrait of a Pop Star,"""Madonna: Truth or Dare"" is an up-close and personal documentary chronicling the singer's 1990 Blond Ambition Tour. Director Alex Kleshishian captures different aspects of Madonna -- the artist, the perfectionist, the shrewd businesswoman, the good bad girl, and the bitch diva, but the movie comes of as a shallow look at the performer. Kleshishian uses black-and-white 16-millimeter film for Madonna's off-stage life and 35-millimeter color film for her on-stage fantasy glamor life.We see an almost obessive desire to have children and be a mother, scenes that contrast interestingly to the cone bra she wears and the ultra sexy persona she becomes onstage. The concert footage captures the excitement and glitz of seeing the performer do her thing in front of adoring fans, but as an introspective look at what makes Madonna tick, the documentary falls short. The only extra is a theatrical trailer."
1,What a Terrible Movie,"Giving this movie one star is generous. I'd give it no stars if it was an option. I am a big fan of Madoona, but this movie is the worst piece of you know what I've ever seen. A ""real life"" documentary? Yeah right!"
5,Colour Blind....,"Living Colour transcended the boundries of music in the late 80's, early 90's. They are like no other band. They have a style all their own. (Like King's X, another band worth checking out). Livings Colour's music is mixed with jazz, hard rock, calypso, blues, r&b, you name it, its got it. Vernon Reid is such an exceptional guitar player and all round musician, where as Cory Glover has explosive lyrics, that move you to the core.With cuts like Cult Of Personality, Glamour Boys, MIddle Man, and others, you cant lose with this CD. Black guys playing Hard Rock, you bet Cha. And they do it like no other...."
5,A GREAT RnB album,"Due to the lack of MTV/BET/MUCH MUSIC/Radio, I don't think this album will be very successful. Which is a shame. Before Dark didn't rush this album and it shows. The album has a few tracks on it produced by S'hekspere who makes the BIG HITS for Destiny's Child, TLC, Pink, NSYNC, & more. U can here the famililar popping bubble noises in the song ""As Far As They Know."" DAYDREAMIN'is filled with great dance, hip hop beats, slow jams, and a little rock in it. Even rapper SOLE appears on the great track ""BABY."" If more publisized, BEFORE DARK could become HUGE stars. DAYDREAMIN' is definantly an album to buy if u like POP/R&B.RECOMENDED if u like TLC, Blaque, Destiny's Child, 702."
1,Worthless waste of money,"This book is a total waste of money. There are typographical errors, if you can imagine. The stories have no cohesion. If you don't already know the videos, you can't follow the stories at all. I bought this so that my daughter (3) can know what her friends are talking about who all watch the videos. The stories jump about here and there and change the original story line anyway so they just don't make any sense to her. Or to me, for that matter, and I have seen the videos. There are better books out there for your money."
3,Not the best pictures.,"For a picture story book, I was a little bummed about the lack of full page pictures. However, if you're more into the actual story this is still a great book. Good price."
5,Shipped as promised,This was sent to a niece so we could read stories together. It was shipped and delivered as promised
4,Doggie sweater,My little toy terrier loves this sweater! She dances around when she see me coming with it.
2,okay bike with many deficits,The bike rides okay but it takes a while to install. This could take a lot of time if you don't have the experience and tools... one of my pedals fell off after just two weeks and the inner screw thread is kinda washed already and cannot be put back on.
2,very poor shiftings,"The bike looks great, it has a decent height; nonetheless, the shiftings are horrendous, the bike is heavy and slow, if you can get this for 150 then go for it, but it should be used for sidewalks or perhaps 25 mph on the road. Don't even think you can climb hills with this bike, it's literally impossible. I bought this piece of crap for commute biking and I'm starting to think it was all a huge mistake. Sigh, just stay away from this one if you are using as a transport vehicle for work or schools specially if there are hills in your town. One other thing do not expect to go more than 35 mph YOU CAN'T"
1,GMC Topkick Dual-Suspension Mountain Bike,"I got same problems like one guy, so i just copy his review and added couple lines. The bike that came out of the box, it NOT the same what was promises on a purchase.1. All bike is felling a part.2. Strong aluminum wheel set featuring V-shape rim profile and high-flange alloy hubs but the actual bike does not have this, but simple rims3. Brake levers: GP 30 AP aluminum, but the actual brake levers are plastic4. Tires: Kenda black with yellow band 700 x 25C but the bike has some no name tires5. The front wheel has a quick release system but the actual bike has screws at both the end6. The stand of the bike in the pictures is also not the same as the one that I have7. Even didint take a test drive when so that a balls from the back wheel bearing.I then decided to return the bike, because I had thought I was buying a quality product, but what came out of the box was very disappointing. will never buy again."
2,poor quality,"I only ride the bike probably 5 times due to the cold weather. The first problem is the front suspension become loosen and shakes when I brake. And not too long later. When I'm on my way to the class, the plastic part of the right foot pedal broke."
2,First look,ok so this will update this as i progress but as of now its looking a little bit of a shoddy product. assembled it and knew id have to adjust the disc so thats fine. whats not fine is im pretty sure the rear derailleur system is bent because it hits the spokes when on the high gear. havent looked at it in detail so maybe i can adjust but we will see
4,"Awesome bike, Great for price!","I didn't want to buy a $500 bike, so I went to Amazon instead. Even though I had to put the bike together, it was still worth it paying half the price for a bike of around the same quality. Love the disc brakes on both wheels. My only problem was that I got a flat in the first four weeks of use (hard use for an all-terrain bike) and had to adjust the front disc brake so it wouldn't squeek so much. All in all, this is a great bike, and I anticipate it being my college ride for many miles to come."
3,GMC Topkick Ok,"The bike is good for what you pay for. However, some of the components are rather cheap. Personally, I had one of the pedals fall off after ~30 miles. The bolt that held it in place was stripped. For a mountain bike which should take some heavy hits, a few miles on paved roads should not break it. Looking into the warranty now to see what can be done."
2,Over priced for. The quality,"Cheap parts ,some rough finish parts, poor quality manual no real guide to asemble the bike, no technical support at all, I end up returning the bike, the front shifter never worked properly, I had to accept 85% of the value due to amazon regulation.:("
1,Worst ever,I got this bike and when assembled correctly it nearly killed me. It fell apart and just was a nightmare in general.
5,Gravel Roads,"I've had this bike for 6 months now and I agree that this is a great product. It shifted a little rough at first but it quickly broke in and now shifts great. I bought this particular bike because of the suspension and tires for riding on gravel roads. It rides a lot smoother on the gravel than I thought it would, potholes and loose gravel is problem with this bike.As I learned the hard way, I would recommend getting a bike pump that you can attach to the accessory screws where the bottle holder should be located."
2,"Sorry, Albert","I love Albert Cummings's playing, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of his DVD. Unfortunately, this DVD does very little to help you play like Albert. Very little tab and what tab there is is of a few simple licks you already know. Albert's obviously a nice guy with a great attitude, but leaves a lot to be desired as a guitar teacher. This DVD is almost entirely Albert giving his thoughts on pedals, playing style, gigging, etc. No tab of his cool runs. Only the most beginning player will benefit from the limited tab here, and only advanced players who like to learn without tab will benefit from watching Albert play a little on the DVD. Kind of like YouTube but for $20. Albert, you should hook up with TrueFire and do a real instructional video with accurate tab. Anyway, I'll keep buying your tunes on iTunes."
4,"If you're a Strung Out fan, please by this one...","Deville is a Canadian band playing technical, fast, hard-hitting punk. They sound almost like Consumed, only faster. While Strung Out changed their sound almost completely to the worse, and Bigwig split up, Deville are the ones carrying on the torch. This album probably is not a four star rating, more of an 3,5 but I rate upwards for once becouse I love the concept of fast, energic pop-punk with an slim influence of metal. Although nothing in this special genre will beat Strung Out's ""Suburbian Teenage Wasteland Blues"" and ""Twisted by Design"", I still grow lyrical when a great peace like this comes up. I found this by a coincidence when I was into Propagandhi, but now I can make more people hear this. I never speak highly of popularity, I simply want people who loved Strung Out to remember the great days. I probably could give this album five stars to get people more convinced, but I won't sink that low."
1,who the hell is jesse? arent they a band?,"i guess the jesse taylor band, i mean gloria bills, are rocking."
3,Not your rockin blues,"It was too smooth for me,I like my blues with a lot of guitar, it sounded like a 50's lounge act to me. ""I'm Your Girl"" was a nice cut, more of the style I like. The Sax playing on this album was definetly not to my liking. I thought the songwrtiting was a little lame/sophmoric on some cuts. I liked her singing, but I would have liked it much better with a differant musical arrangement-more guitar,a heavier beat, a little more rythmic shadings, lose the Sax and the song ""Blues Psalm"". Oh yeah- she's good looking, but I couldn't see her through my headphones."
5,"A really great ""gritty"" blues sound","The way I think the blues are best defined. In particular I enjoyed ""Please Stop Seeing That Girl"" & ""I'm Your Girl"". She can sing & she can write the blues the way that they are meant to be. I'm a big fan of Muddy Waters & John Lee Hooker also Bonnie Raitt & Angela Strehli and now I'm including Cathy Jean in that group. I really liked the music!"
5,Excellent album! A winner!,"Cathy Jean's got the attitude to be a great blues singer. She feels the blues! Very effective CD. Great vocals, clever lyrics, strong conviction, talented! --Karen Liebowitz, Music Monthly Magazine"
3,Maybe Lillie should have written the book....,"The reason I read this book was because I was writing a paper on the importance of attending church for a theology class, and I wanted a different viewpoint. While Dan Stockin makes some valid points throughout the book, his points are merely the flaws that are apparent in almost all churches (collecting money, inequality, etc) and are not necessarily reasons to stop attending church.I believe that Mr. Stockin firmly believes everything he says, but he also doesn't hesitate to use the phrase ""Lillie says"" or ""Lillie believes"" in every other paragraph. To explain who Lillie is, she is a woman pastor that was never officially ordained, but has strong beliefs that are made apparent throughout the book.Overall, it is an interesting point of view, but I think that it may be a bit too ""new age"" for some people, and certainly wouldn't stop me from attending church."
2,Good.....for the first week!,Tis was a good product only for the first week +. Then your clip function will start to break down because of te weakplastic cogs in the back. It is garbage and not worth the effort to buy.Do yourself a favor and get something authentic.
2,"No comparison to Villians. Disturbing, distorted production","Villians is a CD that I never tire of listening to. Unfortunately the new effort lacks any outstanding songs, the production quality is down right irritating to listen to far to much distortion. After several listens, disapointed."
2,Lacking the Verve,"The Verve Pipe's self-titled release (their fourth album and follow-up to the multi-platinum Villains) has most of the ingredients for a solid album: sophisticated arrangements, textures, and simmering lyrics. However, the key ingredient missing is the fire, the energy, that made their past efforts so much more enjoyable. Also, none of their tracks stand out (no distinguishing features), a result of repetition and lazy electronic tamperings -- most of the songs are drowned in guitar strings and computer beeps. This Verve Pipe set lacks the diversity and central energy that made Villains so edgy."
1,An outstanding disappointment.,"I loved ""Villains"". It was a great sounding album full of great songs. This album, to me, is quite the reverse. I found the songs very mediocre and quite honestly I think this is the worst sounding rock record that I've heard in a long time."
3,It's the sound quality.,I have listened several more times and am coming around it does get better with repeated listenings. The problem I have is the quality of the sound/recording.There is a distorted quality to it that is irritating to listen to and no it's not my audio gear it is all Carver.
4,real good!,"how can anyone like this CD? If you like alternative..you will enjoy this release.they mixed college and grunge together in this CD. the best song..i feel ..is ""hero"". the radio stations only played the song long enough to tease you..then just stop playing it. other stand-outs on the CD - ""she loves everyone"" ""kiss me idle"" ""the F word"" and ""she has faces"" buy it all you grunge fans...it's not dead yet!"
5,Wonderful ...can't get enough.,"I ordered this product a week ago and it came in as long as expected with ground shipping. The scent is hypnotic and absolutely beautiful. Recommend this to anyone looking for a scent that becomes your own after wearing. It is so soothing, goes on strong at first but once it mixes with you body chemistry it is wonderful. Please stay in business!!!"
5,Wonderful Scent and Pleasant to Use,This perfume has a unique scent--feminine and interesting but not fussy. I ordered it because other perfumes were giving me a rash. The organic preparation of this seems to have solved that problem. I wear it almost daily.
5,Superb!! Every family should own it!!,"This movie was absolutely superb!! The constant plot-twists, high level of adventure, acting, story-line, cinematography and statements about slavery and friendship are extraordinarily well-done. Kudo's to all involved!! I just wish Disney would release it on DVD. :) In short, it's so good that every family should own this film. I can see why Siskel & Ebert gave it ""Two Thumbs Up!!"" It's going to be recognized in later years as a true American Classic, right up there with ""It's A Wonderful Life."""
5,"Don't Worry, Just Buy It -- You'll Love It","What a great movie! Good for adults and older kids (maybe 8 years old+). Script is well written, based on Twain's novel. Character portrayal draws you into the movie, and then the film is just the right length -- I've really enjoyed it every time I've seen it. Somewhat serious, but with nice characters and relaxing humor so it's very enjoyable. Also a more accurate representation of slavery, too, so kids pick up some good horizon-expanding. Some parents might want to watch with their children for a couple of scenes -- one is with ""Pap"" toward the beginning when he's drunk, and another almost at the end, when the climax hits while Huck is trying to escape with Jim."
4,A favorite adaptation of a favorite novel,Twain's masterpiece could not be better portrayed than by young Elijah Wood and Courtney Vance. The portrayals of Huck and Jim are now the standard others will have to follow - and it will be a hard act to follow indeed. Mark Twain fans will be very pleased with this adaptation of the Twain classic novel.
3,A Children's Movie,"Although this movie is moreso for the younger audience, I feel that this movie in correlation to the novel by Mark Twain comes in at no comparison. The novel was greatly altered for screen. I also do believe that I cannot give a proper entertainment review do to that I happened to read the book first. To me, the movie seemed far too fast and choppy as well as lacking the emotional value given by the characters and deleted scenes in the book. I do not recommend this movie unless you have not yet read the novel.-Anias"
5,Fantastic Billiard and Pool Book!,"This book is exceptionally good. It's also WAY cheaper than it should be. It easily beats the other billiard books that I looked at. I luckily ran across this book while looking at (and reading!) many, many other books in the local ""Large Popular Bookstore"", and I'm glad that I chose this one. This is my first billiard book, and probably my last. It starts at the basics and goes through to the advanced topics. The book is very well written and the diagrams are superb and concise. The online content that he provided on his website is just icing on the cake. I also bought the DVD that contains all of the videos on his website, along with additional commentary, based on the quality of his book. If you're deciding on which billiard book to get, this should be the one. I strongly recommend this book."
5,An enlightening work,"Dr. Alciatore,Thank you for what you did in writing the book. I've bought three to four books on pool, trying to discover the mysteries.Yours is so thorough in its coverage and easy to understand. It must have taken A LOT of work to do what you did.I am enjoying it and it has greatly increased my understanding. It's a beautiful game and your work does it justice.Thank youBrittCary, North Carolina"
4,Great movie,"I can't say I have really cared for most of the Jane Austen movies that I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre these last few years, but this movie is an exception. The acting is good, but more importantly, the characters' personalities haven't been changed. Yes, a few things aren't quite right (including Mr. Knightly's age, but he is so lovely!), however, the movie is very entertaining."
4,Good but missing passion,"I really liked this version of Emma. It is definitely one of my favorite books. The only thing missing is the passion when Knightly confesses his love for Emma. I was anticipating this scene. I love the build up and hidden passion of the scene, for me it was missing. Other than that it was a very good adaptation."
4,Well Worth Getting,"Emma has been particularly well served on film and this version is much longer than either Paltrow's or Beckinsale's which is a plus. Here we have an Emma who is rich and handsome but not quite as clever as she should be, a victim of the modernized dialog many reviewers have commented on. Why not leave well enough alone - there's a reason we're still reading these books 200 years later!The supporting players are very good as are the production values. All in all not up to the recent Sense and Sensibility but despite the above caveats well worth having."
3,a bit too slow,love jane austen books and some movies. this just didn't have the character developement needed to draw you in too the story
3,Entertaining,Prefer version with Gwenyth Paltrow overall in terms of all character portrayals. Enjoyed the early years setup at beginning of this one which helps one understand the motivations of the characters.
5,One of the best Jane Austen movies I have ever seen,"I think this is Emma as Jane Austen intended it. Romola Garai is simply perfect, and Michael Gambon was an excellent Mr. Wodehouse. The dance at the Crown Inn was my favorite. You can actually see Emma and Mr. Knightly falling in love. The music is so beautiful as well. It made the book come alive for me."
5,Beautiful Production,"I think this is a beautifully produced movie. I did not see the original airing, so I am not sure if it is whole or incomplete. Regardless, the characters were well played by the actors, who I think were all well chosen. In my opinion, this is the best version of Emma I have seen."
1,Austen in Name Only,"The arc of the plot is Austen. The names of the characters. The outlines of their relationships.The verbal subtlety, the character detail, most especially the dialogue, are NOT AUSTEN. Terrible, heavy handed and clumsy version of the novel. The Frank Churchill sub-plot of the novel is vastly expanded - and not in a good way. Jane Fairfax is insipid. Elton and wife are not at all amusing.Were Austen alive, she would probably ask that HER name be taken off the credits.IT""S THAT BAD!!"
2,She's silly.,"I like period pieces and Jane Austen, but Emma leaves me cold. Maybe it's the portrayal by the actress...hard to imagine any of her friends liking her very much."
4,Beautiful and fun!,"This Emma is more fun and more understanding. The cast is perfect, Romola Garai is perfect as Emma Woodhouse, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley. I gave it four stars because the very end is not enough pomp for four episodes. With all the great language included. There are balls and more along the line of those Jane Austen may have attended. Lovely!!!!!"
2,Great but Cut short.....,"First of all, I think this is the best way to learn a new language. NOW, There are only 10 lessons that leaves you short if you want to continue. That means after 10 days, you are just past the beginner stage and you have nothing else. I used this for Japanese and am fluent now, If they had more for thai I would buy it too, but they don't...."
2,yellow card,"Michael Apted's film of the 2006 World Cup Finals is bizarre because it doesn't include footage of the two best goals of the tournament (Joe Cole for England against Sweden and Maxi Rodriguez for Argentina against Mexico). Also, there is extensive video of matches that were dull while no footage of the best match of the tournament, France's victory over Brazil, is included. Zidane's performance against Brazil, where he almost singlehandedly controlled the entire match, is where he demonstrated that he is one of the greatest players of all time."
1,I can't believe how bad this was,"this is a terribly done compilation DVD for soccer/football afficiandos...the focus on ""key"" matches was essentially showing poorly edited highlights of a match here and there made all the worse by the lack of any play-by-play or context. Brosnan's narration was banal, insipid, completely scripted and rendered in a state of boredom... he must have really needed to pay some bills to agree to put his name to this wretched production. It was produced by Sony, who couldn't, it seemed, care less about how to make a soccer/football compilation.the gold standard for these type of films is set by Reedswain, and this falls so far short, I should have demanded my money back as soon as viewed it (actually, as soon as I viewed the first half of it)... don't bother, there are other good ones out there."
2,Less than mediocre,"I found this DVD less than mediocre. It is difficult to understand how such a exciting sports event could produce such an underwhelming product.The commentary is sparse to say the least. Almost all actions (literally) are not commented at all, and often you have no clue about who the players are (unless you are a true expert...). There is close to no soundtrack. Most of the action is filmed from a really annoying low angle that makes it almost impossible to appreciate depth of field. About 20% of the movie shows unmemorable actions. Some of the best goals of the tournament are not shown at all, and some non-memorable matches are given way more time than they deserve. An example: we have to see ALL the innumerable yellow and red cards of Netherland-Portugal.It is hard to understand how FIFA could produce such a sub-par product. You can find much more exciting extracts on YouTube. Really not recommended, not even (or maybe especially) if you are a soccer fan."
2,A lot weaker than expected,We bought this table for its light weight and size. We knew it will not be sturdy but it is a lot weaker than expected. The top is made of cardboard. You cannot place heavy dish on it. I wish it can be somewhat stronger and still be light.
4,An engaging tale...,"Like a great crime drama, ""Ponzi"" takes you down the amazing road of a simple huckster, and how close he came to making it big. I knocked it out in under 3 days; it's impossible to put down!"
3,"Please retitle to ""Xenophobes Guide to Los Angeles""","The author missed the mark on any parts of California not already covered by ""Baywatch.""However, if California to you means ""Hollywood"", you'll like this. And may I suggest you watch ""LA Story."" Dated, but sweet and funny."
5,One of the greatest books I have ever read...,"Ya know, every book in the Netheril trilogy is a real piece of art, and this first one is what got me wanting to read the other two. Clayton Emery describes every explosion, cackle, screech, shriek, severed artery and punctured aorta with astounding detail. I could picture every moment in my head. This book is a definite five star book, and I think you should check it out."
3,Supurb Recording but Mediocre Performance,"I disagree with Stephen W. on one point, the recording. The 5.1 24 bit/96 kHz recording on this DVD-Audio is disc is supurb and very life like. However, the orchestra is not up to the professional quality. It's too bad because Dr. Mark Waldrep's recording technique is true art in the high definition audio recording field. It's too bad he can't record or is unable to afford to record a professional orchestra. His recordings for AIXrecords.com are the best 5.1 high resolution recordings I've ever heard, on par or even better than Dr. Johnson's recordings for the Reference Recordings label. Unfortunatly, due to the orchestra's performance I can only give this 3 stars."
4,Worthy of a perusal...,"The first collection certainly pales in comparison to this. The many guises of life are captured by some of the poets in this collection. However, I am amazed at what can be classified as poetry. Though it is obvious all contributors have something to say, few say it poetically. While many just seem to teeter on confusion while attempting to find a concrete resolve to their poetic disadvantage, some simply put pornography to verse. Contemporary or not, poetry should be respected. Not slaughtered.There are a few poems sitting with me still (check out Brett Axel, Tatiana Sanchez, Magnus Johansson, and Kerry Iona Dempster). These contributions, and a few more, speak volumes. One or two are even award material.Worth a read."
5,Secrets of the Runes,"This is a classic book on runic magic. A lot of New Age writers [copy] his occult ideas. The Right misunderstands him and the Left smears him. One of the most lied about men in occult history.This book is well worth the price. Even though many of his ideas have been used by other occult writers, and some of his ideas on magic are standard New Age rite, it is always interesting to visit the soucre where these rivers sprung. Hopefully, all of Von List's book will be made ready to an English speaking market."
4,CDs,"I decided to get the OST of Gungrave after watching my DVDs. I didn't hesitate in going to Amazon.com to look for my purchase. I am very satisfied with my CDs. In fact, I'm listening to them right now. They arrived sooner than I expected and in perfect condition."
4,Good choice,"Bike appears to be well-built. Comfortable. Took hours to assemble. Included assembly instructions not very good, so you are on your own most of the time."
3,Not the best.,"It was a very difficult bicycle to assemble and make all the adjustments properly. I should have realized that for the price I paid for it, it would not be the greatest bicycle. I learned a lesson. I will not purchase something through Amazon in the future if it needs to be assembled like the bicycle did. I had to contact Kent International nine times before they finally returned my call. They sent me a new rear shifter. After I received that shifter, I contacted them 3 more times before they contacted me to answer some questions for me about replacing the shifter properly. Now the bike is fine. I should not have had to go through that much hassle to get it to work properly."
4,Good reference book,I'm actually using this book in a class right now and it is quite a good reference book. It contains information on both the oils and different ailments.
1,Not recommended,This book does a good job describing almost every illness known to man but offers precious little on the subject matter. Will be donated and search will continue for a good reference book.
4,Les grenouilles de l'amour sont agitées...,"Touchez-moi, chéri. Remplissez votre bouche du lait chaud, le lait qui est venu directement de la vache. Léchez-moi de la tte à l'orteil comme un chat. Alors plongez votre doigt dans Nutella et collez-le dans ma narine gauche. Enlevez alors votre ceinture...Avez-vous pris votre ceinture hors fonction? Bon, bon... Mes yeux sont fermés, ainsi je devrai vous faire confiance.La double la ceinture vers le haut. Commencez maintenant! Fouettez les grenouilles! Fouettez les grenouilles! Criez tandis que vous battiez les grenouilles!Toutes les grenouilles ont-elles été battues?Ah, merveilleux. Je pourrais le sentir aussi, mon cher. Je t'aime. Je t'aime avec mon coeur entier. Je t'aime parce que vous tes le seul qui battra les grenouilles pour moi...Embrassez-moi. Je t'aime comme un fromage d'amours d'entraneur. Je t'aime comme des désirs de pain la radio. Je t'aime comme un bol de potage de poireau..."
3,"Long Slow Read, but Liked it Enough to Finish","Having read the blurb for The Dud Avocado I thought I'd LOVE this book because I LOVED A Moveable Feast. Instead, what I got was something more akin to On the Road.While by the end I enjoyed Ms. Dundy's book, it was a slow process of wading through it. Much of the time the story wasn't going anywhere. It was simply a long winded telling of the main character's (Sally Jay Gorce) experience in Paris...this was where the Moveable Feast comparison end for me.The On the Road comparison picked up with the grindingly slow development of any story purpose. Sure I like listening to my friends spin yarns about their experiences, but unless they captivate me with their storytelling style, I tend to mentally shut down after 30 minutes.I started this book months ago and read several other books in the meanwhile. I never thought about NOT finishing the book because I did like, however I could only take so much of it in each sitting."
3,Not what I expected.,"The book isn't bad. It just really isn't my taste. After reading many of the reviews, I expected to be laughing my way all through this book. I maybe laughed once. I just find the main character to be sort of flighty and self indulgent. I guess that is sort of the point, but I found it annoying. I measure how good a book is to me by whether or not I can relate to or feel something for the characters. I didn't care much for anyone in this book and that made it tedious for me to read."
2,Irritatingly bad,"The Dud Avocado is the story of Sally Jay Gorse, a young American woman living the high life in 1950s Paris. From cafes to nightclubs to art shows and the theatre, Sally Jay takes her reader on an intimate tour of her life.I wasn't keen on this book. It's written in a chatty, breathless tone, which was entertaining at first. But about a hundred pages in, the chattiness became almost senseless, irritating babbling. It would have been a better book had the narrator interspersed her story with some witty insights; but sadly, she's not bright enough for that. Sally Jay has a few genuinely funny moments in this novel (the disastrous dinner with Teddy, Larry, the Comtessa, and cousin John comes to mind), but they come at the expense of the other, lesser characters, who become caricatures as portrayed by the narrator. In addition, the book is very, very dated; I imagine some of the things Sally Jay did were shocking fifty years ago, but they're a little passé now."
4,"""Captivating and Maddening""","Hilarious at times, exasperating at times, this cleverly written novel focuses on 21-year-old Sally Jay Gorce and her adventures in Paris during the 1950s. Both clever to the point of brilliance and floundering to the point of being infuriating, Ms. Gorce is, above all, unequivocally lovable. Elaine Dundy has created a novel that, despite its flaws, the reader will find as captivating and maddening as the protagonist finds herself. It is a novel as real as its memorable main character."
1,"Warning - this brand changed packaging and formula - now need to take 2 per day UNLESS you buy ""Once Daily"" formula","I've been taking these vitamins faithfully for about a year now and paying a LOT for them.. imagine my surprise that with my next reorder I got the same 72count but now need 2 a day! What a rip off.On a plus size, these do not upset my stomach and I really like them. I will continue to buy, just make sure to check for 'Once Daily' on the box."
5,worth ordering for Child of Mine,"This is classic Carole King. It's worth ordering for the poignant Child of Mine. If you're looking for music for a wedding, or just to reflect on your child's life, this is a touching ballad."
3,some greats,"I bought this CD mainly for one song that I truly love, which is Johnny Mathis singing a duet on ""The Last Time I Felt Like This"", which is the theme song from a terrific movie called Same Time Next Year with Ellen Berskine and a very young Alan Alda....who overacts, incidentally, but Ellen is breathtaking. That song just takes me away! The other songs are generally good, but several are just too 70's or 80's - a little too much in the high-pitched range. (Some border on sounding like cats mating rather than being in love, etc.) However, if you love even one or two of these classic duets, it is worth the price."
5,Spider-Man The 67' Collection 6 Volume Animated DVD Set.,"Spider-Man The 67' Collection 6 Volume Animated DVD Set:Classic 1967 Tv series on dvd, 5 stars because it is Spidey! take note the series/episodes at times utilize the same animation more than once,has Canadian Voice actors(""Process"",A-gain,etcera)Peter Parker sounds like he is 40 and not a Teenager, His suit does not have all the lines. Villains who are not in the Comic book. Very Trippy at times,what were the writers thinking? almost all the made up villains were green or on some other dimension?Demons? other than that,it's a trip back in time for those who were there and those of us who were not.A Must for any SpiderMan Fan!Highly Recommend it!"
4,Lightweight and easy to use,"The cane was very lightweight and just the right length. If a cane is too long it can trip those around but this was just perfect for my brother who is 5'10"". Don't let kids play with it, the joints are at risk for bending. Otherwise a very good purchase."
3,"Amazing story, amateur production","This beautiful story was told in LDS General Conference by Gordon B Hinckley, and has since been made into a children's picture storybook too. The production values of the storybook are better than this video, but both fail to capture the profound emotion and principles embodied in the story. The title character in the story, the schoolteacher, is played well by Sam Payne, a very talented folk singer/songwriter, and the boy who plays Jimmy is also pretty good (until what should be the emotional climax, which falls flat). The other children are painfully amateurish, as is much of the writing/directing/cinematography. Having said that, the story is so good that the video is worth having as a modern way to visually depict it."
3,Didn't work out for me.,"I waited forever for this case to arrive, and when it finally did, I was disappointed. The cut-out hole for the apple logo did not align the the computer. Everything else seemed fine, but I sent it back because it looks pretty janky if only half of the apple light is shining through the hole. I'm curious whether other buyers have had this problem. I'm too scared to buy it again in case all of the cover have messed up holes."
3,Monster Magnet - self-titled (Glitterhouse) EP - 3 1/2 stars,"Cannot even believe this 1990 release is still available.Must've been reissued.This is the hard-to-find(well,in stores anyway)six track EP that Monster Magnet had put out as their very first CD.Duration,27:43.It's a good EP,with the better cuts being the ass-kicking ""Snake Dance"",""Tractor""(they've done this tune before during their live shows a few years back)and the seven-minute rocker ""Nod Scene"".Should be in every Monster Magnet's fan collection."
2,Few times played,"Seemed excited when she opened the box, but as far as I can tell, my daughter has not played this game much. Asked why, she said it was alright."
3,Undivided Attention,"Undivided Attention, that's what I give to this First Call album. Fine lyrics and lovely music. One of my all time favorite groups and style of music. Get your hands on a copy if you don't already have one!"
5,Hilarious!,"I saw this when it ran on cable a couple years ago - a really funny short film! A woman enters a Peep Show where men SAY all the things women really want to hear, but never get to. There are alot of good gags along the way and a hilarious ending. Very clever - why can't Hollywood make movies this funny?!"
1,Region error,"The first copy of this DVD gave the message ""Region error Please eject the disk Playback is not authorized in your area""The replacement disk was exactly the same.Diana Krall - Live in Paris"
1,Diana Krall Live in Paris,I am sorry to say that i cant review this DVD.And that is because Amazon dont understand the simple fact about regions for DVDS.As a customer from Sweden you would think that amazon could send me an DVD that actully could be played in Sweden.Amateurs!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Breathtaking, sexy, sensual, classy........and then some!","This DVD captures the true essence of the smooth and sexy Diana Krall. Sound Quality (DTS) surpasses any concert dvd I have owned or heard. Elvis Costello is one lucky guy! There is nothing bad to say about this concert dvd, a must have in any collection. Absolutely superb."
2,Felt very slow,"Caveat: I'm not into jazz. If you are, then probably just ignore this review.I thought I should listen to this concert since it gets such a high rating.I felt that the concert really dragged. I couldn't wait till it was over.The 5.1 sound mix is well recorded. I just couldn't get into this kind of music.I also watched the Norah Jones Live in New Orleans concert. That's jazz but I did find it very pleasing."
5,World Class Muscian Support,"Others have commented on Diana's superb talent and the marvelous production values of this DVD (except for a couple of grumpy people who don't like anything), but attention should also be called to the other players in her primary quartet, Jeff Hamilton on drums, John Clayton on bass and Anthony Wilson on guitar. They are premier world-class jazz artists in their own right, and Diana, as always, generously gives them room to play. It all makes this DVD an unbelievable delight."
3,It can be better,"Diana Krall will always be Diana Krall. Smooth as a silk voice. Impeccable and just right. She looks good too. I know some people will not agree on her being a great jazz performer but I like her. However, this DVD is badly made. Whoever mastered the sound for DTS and Dolby must be confused. The idea is to put you, the listener as a member of the audience listening in front of the performer. What is the piano doing on my right surround speaker? Some songs she sounds clear and too closely miked and in some songs she sounds singing 3 feet away from the micropohone. Bad sound mastering of what should be a great performance. It messed up the artist and the meticulous preparation they put into it."
4,USB to USB mini cable,It's a cable. What can i say about it? It got here fast and so far it is working. Thanks folks.
4,"It's a cable, no more, no less","Tad shorter than expected, but it's a cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Seems to be well made, haven't had problems, we we'll let it go at that.TIS A CABLE"
1,Awful,This cable is awful. Would not charge my phone or GPS which share the same connector. I could transfer data but it wouldn't carry enough juice to charge.I bought a nice OEM motorola cable and it has worked perfectly.
2,Cecil B. not that good,"I have seen and enjoyed many of John Waters films, but this was almost boring. I understood the idea of it and parts were entertaining. Im sure if you were a fanatic of Waters or either of the stars you may like this, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just ok. I'm most happy I rented it so now i know I wasn't missing anything as good as Waters old stuff. Even ""Serial mom"" and ""Pecker"" I enjoyed more..."
1,Garbage still smells like stank the next morning.,"I know that if my garbage can is lined with a scented bag, the insides still reak of yuck. Even if I tie it with a knot and place it on the curb, and the knot is finely taught and the bags lined in proportion, deep down somewhere in the recesses of my minds eye, I still know, no matter how hard I may want to candycoat it, that it is still trash.Here then is Cecil B. Demented. I understand that my foulness of this horrible film will be a flame war for those avant-garde, art house, belly churning, curtled milk type, Grindhouse-praising 'as-if-it's-the-next greatest-thing-to-sliced-bread' groupies, however if you are a die hard john waters fan, what's there not to love?? If he made poop walk, you would think it was fascinating.Waste money, buy this, and then trash it. It is as appealing as leaving your trash untied and unkept in your living room. Pure and total ca-ca."
4,Great Show.,"I didn't realize that there were 10 seasons of this show. I grew up watching this show every week, and when I found this collection, I couldn't help myself.Quality was great, and the set was neatly boxed and sorted by season.If you like the show, this collection is well worth the buy."
4,Season 7 disk 1,"Season 7 disc 1 does not work. Is it possible to get a replacement disc for it? Every other disc has worked perfectly up till now.Paul Nelson12735 State Road 70Grantsburg, WI 54840paul.nelson@my.uwrf.eduIf you could I would Appreciate it.ThanksPaul Nelson"
4,Keepin' the stoner rock sound alive!,"Are you kidding me? No one's reviewed this yet? Damn, this is a stone-cold classic. This here's from the early 90's, basically one of the few albums at that time keeping the Sabbath/Cheer sound alive. And with lines like: ""She wanted nuthin'/And I delivered,"" you KNOW you're in the right place. Fantastic."
1,I want my money back....,I used to like back in 2003 but now I absolutly hate this show and I want my money back. The episodes are boring and unrealistic and she NEVER FREAKING DIE. I hate it and (...)so stupid show.
4,Novel based on Sir Walter Raleigh (Ralegh),"From Publishers Weekly review on back cover: ""One of the finest novels we have ever read, a book that you will remember long after you have finished it. Mr. Garrett, a magnificent storyteller, opens out for us a vast world of the imagination. The whole panorama of Elizabethan England comes to life."""
4,Awsome game but difficult!,"This game rocks! You get to use awsome gadgets to get you through the levels. Plus the things that try to stop in the levels. I am talking to everyone, THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!"
5,Start your own wine club for and with your friends and learn about wine,"Start your own wine club for and with your friends and learn about wine with the help of THE WINE CLUB: A MONTH-BY-MONTH GUIDE TO LEARNING ABOUT WINE WITH FRIENDS. A seasonal arrangement offers monthly varietal focus in a title which includes recipes for complimentary dishes, tips on how to taste and learn, overviews of wines and glass styles, and much more.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,"Fresh, funny, informative","Maureen Petrosky writes fresh, funny prose filled with information that will be valuable for all levels of wine appreciation, but particularly for beginners. Her style and procedure are no-hassle, designed to reduce the fear-factor that enters so many people facing rows of bottles in the retail store. Her month-by-month guide runs smoothly through all sorts of wine and food concepts. A great gift book."
5,Thanks for the memories,"I didn't get to see Bob Hope when I was in Vietnam (1970-71) so this is possibly the next best thing. The soldiers I served with all thought the world of Hope. I remember the guys in my unit asking if they could go see the show, but were not able to because our officers said they could not be spared. This is a great addition to my Vietnam souvenirs and remembrances."
1,Problem with Cable Modem,"While the idea of the Turbo Twist Spelling is great, we purchased it with the Mind Station so that we could set it up weekly with our daughter's spelling list. Then the problems began, I am now in the fourth call with technical support, over an hour so far among the three calls. There is apparently an unresolved problem in using the Mind Station with a cable modem and perhaps other parameters of my system. I have used the Mind Station with a dial-up connection on someone else's system and it worked fine. The problem has been turned over to engineering but I have yet to hear from them.My conclusion - as a stand-alone Turbo Twist Spelling is okay but lacks the customization that really connects it with the child's school environment. If you have a dial-up connection that you can use for the Mind Station, you will probably be satisfied. If, however, you have a cable modem connection, you may be in for nothing but frustration."
2,Not too good,"This game really wasn't good. The entire game is dark, and you can't see anything. The mini-games are okay, but the story-line is practically non-existant."
5,It's Pretty GOOD!,"I have to say, it's buggy. One time i jumped on a plant and i kept tripping and never got up. It's pretty hard too. Otherwise, it's pretty fun."
4,A good sequal,"Bloch did a good job with the sequal to his maserepece psycho, but moste of it drug and focused on things that were not important, but I do recomend it fore those of you that have red the first one."
5,Amazing,"This is not for fans of MadTV. This DVD set is for smart people, so if you love MTV and corporations, this is not for you. Bob and David are absolutely brilliant, you'll understand why they have such a huge following. Make yourselves familiar with this DVD and their other works."
1,Tries too hard,"Just not that funny. I was really disappointed. Never saw the show on HBO, had great hype. Couldn't even finish watching it."
3,Not representative of their better work,"I was inspired by an earlier review that trashed Mr. Show. That review was basically correct as it applied to this DVD. I am a rabid Mr. Show fan and I was drooling to get this DVD and not have to watch it on crappy VHS tapes. But I was surprised how much less I liked these episodes than the ones they did later. There is a big difference. The shows I have from season 4 really could be called the best sketch comedy ever. Some of the shows on this disc are real stinkers though. If you are a die hard fan- I recommend this DVD just for the few diamonds in the rough you will find (like the sketch on how the founding fathers choose our flag). If you are not already a fan, wait for the later seasons to come out."
5,"Mr. Show is the cat's meWow! That's a good soundbite, right?","Mr. Show was a brilliant sketch comedy television show on television about comedy that televised things of a funny nature for telvision viewing audiences who turned on a television show expecting to see funny things on television. It never really worked out. But it did bring forth a huge mass of people known as the ""cult Mr. Show following"" whom through their will and strong conviction of trading bootleg copies of Mr. Show over Ebay raised the marketing eyebrows' of HBO. HBO did what any great pay cable service would do -- they milked the cow! Thank you HBO for milking the cow so that now all starving television minds may suckle at the teat of their boob tube."
3,Not bad,"This is a very Monty Python inspired style of sketch comedy where the sketches and monologues all sort of bleed together in one way or another. Sometimes the show will take the watcher from monologue, to skit, to a commercial parody, to song and dance, and then back to a monologue or some other weird avenue. I have to say that I like their fresh approach to comedy but I'll also have to add that their brand of comedy doesn't always work for me and I thought at some points the supporting talent outside of Bob and David were a little weak at points. On this particular dvd set I really enjoyed the musical, the music video, the mom and pop porn shop, and the episode where David tries to pee on the flag. I also thought the best thing on the dvd was in the extras and it was some weird episode about drugs. Really good stuff. Not on the same level as Kids in The Hall or The State but a good approach none the less."
5,"if you regret buying this DVD, then there's something wrong",Mr. Show is simply the funniest f#*@ing sketch comedy show of all time. Sometimes its the only thing that makes life bearable. Let's all pray the HBO releases the subsequent seasons on DVD as well.
5,Passion and Love,"This is one of the best books I have ever read!! Rolfe is a ruthless prince, sent to New Orleans on a mission to find his brothers killer. Instead, he finds a woman with a mistaken identity. This book is a great read over and over!!"
2,"Nothing new, just great past stuff! Five stars for the great","Maná's music and style are great but they are in the middle of their current tour; so instead of a new album we get this assemblage of past material. Though it is all prime material and a very good CD for a Maná neophyte, it does not even have one new song; which would make die-hard fans drool for it. It would have been nice if it included those Maná rarities that are found in other artists' albums; such as ""Celoso,"" ""Fool in the rain,"" and ""Corazón espinado"" so as to have them all in a real Maná album. For true fans this CD would not add anything to their collections so this is certainly not for the person that has all previous Maná material. If you are going to get into Maná, it is best to buy the real albums as you miss out a lot of great songs with this sampler. Nothing new, just great past stuff! Five stars for the great songs... but minus two stars for the lousy way of trying to get"
3,the scorpion king,"the scorpion king, starring the rock, has a video game debuting on the GBA in april or may. it is a fun side scrolling game, but is really not pushing the limits of the GBA's capabilities. it is not even close to the limits of the GBA. it is a simple side scrolling game, looking as if it is on the regular gameboy. if side scrolling is your thing, then i suggest you get this game. It is not a must have game, but can pass the time if you have no other games."
3,Peter Weller still kicks a$#...,"This cool heist flick from the folks at City Heat Productions (the best Direct-to-Video company ever) is chic, action-packed, and highly entertaining. The plot has been seen many times before. A retired jewel theif decides to go on one more big score in order to get his brother out of trouble. The acting could use a little polishing, save for Peter Weller and Bryan Brown, but the rest of the movie is very well-done and nicely polished to create an almost Tarentino-like feel to the whole thing. Sure it's nothing compared to Resevoir Dogs or The Usual Suspects, but it is a very fun flick with twists and turns up till the very end. I enjoyed watching this fun, but ultimitely forgettable flick. Just don't expect any extras on the DVD."
5,Great album!,"I saw this movie about 4 years ago and I loved its music. These tracks are all hand-picked to offer the maximum feeling for the movie. They just make you want to get up and dance. The best two songs on this album in my opinion are ""The Time of My Life"" and ""Hungry Eyes"", both being huge hits in America a long time ago. They're great driving songs and soon you'll find yourself singing along or tapping at least a finger to Merry Clayton's ""Yes"" or thinking of your loved one when hearing Swaize's ""She's Like the Wind"". Classics remain classics and this CD brings 12 high quality true pop songs."
5,Who could have thunk it?,"Where in the world can you get such a great combination of old and new and enjoy it so much? That's what this soundtrack offers: a little bit of something for everyone. Again, the movie without the soundtrack would have just been a movie - but it's the music that made it a hit. Another ""must own"" soundtrack!"
5,Just what the back needed!,"I have two herniated back discs, so I bought one of these cushions for my home computer chair for some temporary relief. The cushion works so well, I sometimes take it over to the couch and watch T.V., etc. as well.I am now going to order a 2nd cushion for my work chair, to replace the flemsy 1st lamb's covered cushion that I bought. This tush-cush is very durable and offers the proper tail-bone relief that I need...Highly recommend it!"
5,Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon [Hardcover],The book is in great condition and was delivered in a timely fashion. I recommend this book for those who are seriously caring about what our Creator has in mind for us. The best tool to study and interpret the Hebrew Scripture (so called Old Testament by the christians) on your own without the traditional interpretations.
5,A Hebrew student's toolkit,"I don't know why this great work has not been updated with Dead Sea Scroll information, but BDB is the standard lexicon for Hebrew students. Since the early 20th Century, it has stood the test of time and academic hubris to be the go-to lexicon, theological wordbook, and dictionary for Biblical Hebrew students."
5,An intense set of mystical images from MesoAmerica,"Where to start. These images were shot in black and white with red and/or infrared filters. The effect is mystical with dark skys and high contrast. What this does for the viewer is to convey much of the energy present at these sites if you can be still and tune in. So yes, this is a kind of initiation to these sites for the [now cheap] price of this book. Highly recommended.If you want more philosophical insight into the minds of the cultures in MesoAmerica and their views of the soul (which are quite similar to Egypt) then there is currently a singular master work in this areaBurning Water. Also a highly recommended view into MesoAmerica that the archeologists are just not going to get or be able to give you."
1,WRONG TAPE!,"So the case and product details say this is ""who stole the cookies"" BUT the tape in the case is ""Soap Box Derby"" TERRIBLE!!!"
4,"nice, but get a garter belt","These are nice stockings but they're not for tall or thicker people. The reason is the spandex band right below the lace upper is very tight. I was happy that there wasnt silicone stay up bands, i was afraid they had those. The lower striped portion is 100% nylon, there is no spandex or Lycra in it which I was disappointed about. They look good and are comfortable on me though. I am 5'7"" and 135 lbs. Oh, be sure you invest in a good quality garter belt with metal clips and adjusters and at least 6 clips. I ordered 5 things from different sellers and these were the first to arrive, in three days with standard shipping"
2,Don't buy unless you are a twig,"I liked these a lot but if you have a little bit of thigh don't buy these. I am tall and about average weight and these were a little tight on my thighs. Another issue I has was that they fall down, they start to roll at the top and fall. These were ok but I wouldn't recommend them for these reasons."
3,a little tight,this product is not intended for plus size women. When i made the search it said plus size and fits all. This is not true. they were rather tight on my thighs.
2,Not the way the world I live in works....,"I have a great deal of experience in working with executives in billion-dollar companies. The successful corporate model is much closer to Gordon Gecko than to the personal traits described in this book. I hope that I have simply wandered down a terrible path, and that everything is as nice as suggested in this book - but I doubt it."
2,I could've gained more insight from a nap.,"........that ""tag"" is actually a bit harsh on my part........this really isn't a ""bad"" book (i.e. one that's full of errors).....it's simply a book filled with cute little truisms that basically anyone who reads the Wall Street Journal 4 times a year already knows.Maxwell is really a ""Christian"" writer who writes these little overblown pamphlets. Technically, not religious or prosyletizing in nature, these little books smack of old-boyisms that are tired and have been re-hashed ad infinitum. If you're a young, junior level mid-manager, get it, read it. It's not a terrible book........just don't expect to be ""the Person Others Will Want to Follow"" by ingesting this little bathroom reader."
4,OK,"Shadow Fire is the fifth book in the Shielder series. Since I am a great fan of futuristic/sci fi novels I have read and, for the most part, liked the entire series. I liked this book the least. Jenna's refusal to try to understand the new culture she finds herself in becomes quite tedious. Her responses appear more those of a petulant child than a woman who understands what it's like to be judged on appearances. Still an good read for fans of the series."
1,ridiculous rubbish,"I have never understood why some authors choose to write about historical figures and time periods without doing extensive research beforehand. Although this is supposed to be a historical mystery novel it reads more like a confusing, ridiculous piece of fantasy. Why must author George Baxt include Peter Lorre and Erich von Stroheim as characters in his novel if he's not in the least interested in finding out what these men were really like? Baxt's description of Mr. Lorre and Mr. Von Stroheim is degrading and offensive. It's too bad the author doesn't have more respect for these charming and extremely talented men, who incidentally were both Austrian Jews, not Germans. As for the whole Nazi spy plot -- well, I've read plenty of better-written, more realistic, WWII-era mystery novels. Pass on this one."
2,B.O.E. -- BETTER OFF EXTINCT,"This game has some good ideas, but doesnt execute them well. Combos and Legacy Drives sound good on paper, but are rendered joyless due to E.O.E.'s god awful camera. Reading the instructions is better than playing the game and thats just not right."
3,Some good - some bad,"This movie has so many ups and downs it is hard to rate.I believe the fillers (parts with Burt Reynolds suffering or just lying around) waste this movie away.There are some amazing performances by April Grace, Orlando Jones, and Ja'net Dubois, but the film just falls a little flat in my view. I think most people will enjoy the film, but I think it could have been written a little better. The beginning is a bit confusing and needed more set-up...you'll see what I mean if you watch it.I give it three stars for the good acting by half of the cast.I would like to see Burt Reynolds do more Christian based movies though. He was awesome in Smokey and The Bandit!See ya next review."
1,Don't Be Fooled,I'm not blaming Amazon on this one but these are not the original artists doing these songs. I'm very familiar with the original versions and also with the new versions.This reminds me of the K-tel albums back in the 60's and early 70's. They are all cover versions by wanna be bands. Some of them better than others.For $5.42 it's not a total ripoff but I just want to warn people what they are really getting.
1,"""NEW"" Stereo Recordings by the Original Artists, don't think so","This is false advertising, these are not original artists and sound nothing like the songs. Deceptive."
3,"Easy to listen to, but not definitive","Nice collection of Mark's easy listening songs compiled from his 3 Columbia solo albums. His version of IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND is absolutely beautiful, one of the best vocals he ever did. This song just has a magical mood to it. Worth owning just to have it at last. ARIZONA is his biggest solo hit, but this CD is missing his other solo singles. I and I'm sure tons of other Lindsay lovers would like a "" BEST OF "" CD to collect ALL of his rare Columbia 45's like SILVERBIRD, MISS AMERICA, SOMETHING BIG, MAMACITA, CALIFORNIA, PROBLEM CHILD, ARE YOU OLD ENOUGH, and the others that defined his solo career. Hope a label does him justice with a more complete retrospective of hits & rarities. This is nice, but they took the easy way out of collecting mostly album tracks."
4,Works and fits like the original battery,"It fits just like the original, which was an initial concern as I've purchased replacement batteries in the past that were tough to install and remove."
2,worst troy ever,"I dont know what most of these other reviewers are talking about but if you listened to pastor troy from day one this is by fare his weakest cd EVER including all his underground cds. pt sold out he went commercial on this cd ""Are we cuttin"" a timbaland produced song wit Ms. Jade is the pastors worst song of all time. there are really only five DECENT tracks on this cd if anyone says this cd is tight they must not have been listening to the pastor for a long time or there used to the New York bs ort there just lying. I love Pastor but this cd is horrible and makes a mockery of everything hes built through his hardcoe rhymes."
2,Not as purchased in the past,"I have used this product for years, but this time it appears to have changed. It was always a firm gel which was easy to handle and apply. This tube is more of a liquid, very runny, and hard to use. I'm not sure if the manufacturer has changed the formula, or if it is just this one tube, but it is not what I am used to."
2,I don't think it original,"I have received the item, but unfortunately it doesn't smell as same as the one I had before. I don't think its an original perfume inside of it other than the box and bottle."
3,It's Okay,It's Okay. It kind of smells like cinammon to me. Smells a little bit sweet. The smell wears off after a while.
5,Invaluable reference book,This book should be in the lab of every scientist that uses mice in his/her research. My lab was very depressed when I took it to my new job.
1,Don't buy if you plan to keep for longer than 1 year.,This briefcase wore a hole in a non-wear area and is a signal to poor craftsmanship or it is not all leather as claimed. The leather gave way and it ripped. This apparently is NOT covered in their 1 year warrantee and they declined to take it back I would never buy from them again. Poor service too.
3,"Ceramic 6"" Chef's Knife - White","disappointing, because not sharp on reciept, and requires a special tool for sharpening."
4,"Not a field guide, but great for what it is...","This book is not a field guide...One must know the name of the weed to look up, and then one can confirm it by picture and description.The pictures in this book are beautiful, full color pictures. The descriptions are very helpful. The index includes a lot of common names, which refer you to the correct weed.However, if you did not know the name, possible name or family of a certain weed, then it would be impossible to find, unless you looked through every single picture. So therefore Weeds of the West is not a field guide.That is why I have only given the book four stars... if you are mostly clueless (like me, lol) it is very difficult to find the weed name. Knowing that, I still believe that because of the excellent full color pictures and wonderful descriptions, it is still the best resource on identifying weeds in the west."
2,"good idea, HORRIBLE/CHEESY SONGS","I teach honors 8th graders and used ""Vocab Rock"" (Scholastic) last year to teach SAT words -- the kids loved most of the songs, and they learned a LOT from the songs. Most kids memorized all the lyrics! A lot of those songs were hip-hop style, and that's what this generation (mostly) seems to be willing to get into.This book (ROCK THE SAT) has no real rock -- it's all ""light rock"" if you can call it that (my husband called it ""Christian rock""), and there isn't a single song I'd present to my kids thinking they'd enjoy it or sing to it... let alone in front of peers. Bummer."
4,"I like it, but...","I like the music and lyrics, but my students don't particularly. I use the CD as ""background music"" when my middle schoolers are working independently. They definitely prefer this to classical or soundtracks from classic musicals. I think they must be picking up at least a few words subliminally, which is great!"
2,Limp,"Unfortunately this movie doesn't stand up to the original or even the newer, Highlander: Endgame. This is truly a sequel...just going through the moves to make another in a series hoping to cash in on the dedicated audience. The writing in this is poor, though not as poor as the 3rd in the series. Christopher Lambert doesn't have the same energy or charisma as in others--this improved in the following film. If you never see this one, you won't miss much. Disappointing! The story line is also weak which really makes this an all-around let-down."
3,Nothing to do with the other movies,"This one was not made to be a sequel, because they wanted everyone to understand the story and the legend well. It disturbs me that Christopher Lambert look so old in the movie, but he looks young on the cover. However, that doesnt make the movie bad. This was the first movie I saw Donnie Yen. His remarkable choregraphy of the martial arts scenes made me start watchng other of his movies, but in this one he only has a minor role. This is supposed to be the end of the highlander legend, which has been on forever it seems. all three sequels follows only the first one, not each other.Best sword fighting scenes of all the movies, and the added martial arts gives another star. The only thing that I wonder about, is if Kate survived? in one version, she dies and in the other she survive. Whats the real truth?"
4,The theatrical version was better...,"Endgame is the best sequel ever made for the Highlander series. Highlander 2 Renegade Version was better than the theatrical, Highlander 3 has no hope (except for Debra Unger), Highlander Endgame was great....IN THEATERS! This DVD version screwed up the mood of the film. The added scenes are pointless and boring. The new ending was impossible and happy (with sad music)! The theatrical edit was the best thing to happen to this film, whoever did it should be commended (just look on disc 2 of the DVD on how bad this movie could have been!).I enjoyed the theatrical version, and so far, you cannot purchase it. For those of you who never saw the movie in theatres, you will think this is a bad film. Trust me, it was better."
3,They really need to re-edit this film.,If you like the Highlander tv series then this movie is pretty good. There are a few embarrassing flaws in it though. I hope they decide to release this again and put the effort into editing that it deserves. How many times are they going to screw up Highlander?
5,Director's Cut,"If you saw this movie in the thearether and didnt like it, dont worry i didnt like it either but, the director cut make it good....it re-edits the movie and it makes it fun and entertaing the new ending is much better than the theatrical one. and it promise to have a lot of extras since is a 2 disk set."
3,Pretty good for being a decade old,It was good. Better than the latest Highlander that went straight to video. I would watch it again.
2,A Little Dissapointing,"I, myself, have been a avid Highlander fan for quite some time. I love the first and second one...the third a little less. Endgame seems to land somewhere in between them. The movie tells the tale of the two main Highlanders, Duncan and Connor Macleoud. In this one a source of immense evil has come for their heads and they must stop it at all costs. The movie flip flops back and forth at times. Going through the two of their lives from early Scotland to Germany during the war. As a fan, I want to say I was let down. I love Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul does a decent job during the film. The one thing that saves it were the greatly planned out sword fighting sequences. But still, I felt like I was watching an elongated episode of Highlander on USA. Check it out if you're in the mood for some action."
2,You are kidding Right!,"A glorified TV episode with a few special effects. Potential was there to really crank it up but they just fall short. One would think that after 400 years you would amass a wealth of knowledge and talent. Speak many languages, blend into different customs. They should have done this on multiple locations with different fighting styles of different cultures. Guess I should start writing my own scripts. Buy something else."
3,"Okay, With One Big Redeeming Factor(Spoilers)","The movie definitely has it's flaws, but it's far better than The Quickening or The Source.To start with the villain is interesting, even if he's cheesy at times he's fun to watch. You can tell the actor had fun with the role. When he dies his quickening it pretty awesome too.I think the big thing here is Connor's death, I don't think they could have handled much better if they wanted to send him off. He goes out with a sincere and heartwarming goodbye as he makes the heroic sacrifice to give Duncan his power. It's really a sad and beautiful scene."
2,Don't bother watching it unless you are a Highlander fan,"I am a big fan of Highlander TV series, and I like Highlander movie one and three. That didn't help at all, I still think End Game is a bad movie.I can see why this did so bad in the box office. You need to know the movie and the TV shows very well, or you'll be confused. I wouldn't mind that if the overall movie is done well just for fans, unforturnately that's not the case. Relationships underdeveloped, scene of Duncan and Connor's fight too awkward emotionally, and the plot is not solid enough.Despite that, there are still three reasons to watch this DVD- Cool action scenes (great sword fights), Connor & Duncan together (yeah!), and the extra features & earlier cut of the movie."
2,"Not like the original, but it tried, but not really","All right. Watch the trailer. It is so much better than the movie. The trailer has all the good parts of this movie. There is nothing that great about this movie. There wasnt enough scenes in the past. I felt the lighting was terrible. The parts in the present looked so cheesy. Mario Van Peebles cant act at all. The girl in the movie is hot, but she couldnt act with anyone in this. Just watch the trailer folks. NO Sean Connery, no nothing. NO Queen music. Nothing. Very dissapointing. That is all I got to say about that"
3,The Last Big Mac,The third and final in the Highlander series is ok but after the first movie the the rest and the tv series made no sense. They could have made the other movies and tv shows better. The story lines had no sense of themselves. I think they just produced the movies without any thought to satisfy the hunger of the cult following the first movie produced. So after the first movie the rest were just a fast food version of the original.
2,The TV version much better,"This makes the 3rd Highlander I've seen (missed the second one), I've yet to be impressed. For your money you get something the length of two television episodes and with exactly the same format, lots more blood,greater violence and some nudity being the difference.I mean, the series had to have a lower budget than this thing yet it was still much better. Save your money watch the TV show if you can."
4,Tonic for the Soul,"I think this is a great album. Tonic is one of my favorite bands. I think they are a very under rated band. Along with Dishwala. It's great to be able to see them in small venues though because of this.I didn't enjoy this as much as Lemon Parade and Sugar on the first listen, but after a couple of plays, I'm hooked. This one is a little more slick.If you like Tonic, Buy it."
3,Not as catchy as their preivious offerings,"I Really Love Tonic! I still listen to them today. But this album left me a little disappointed. I think it may have to do with the lead singer's facial hair. Every album that I have of Tonic, the lead singer has facial hair and it is a great album. The others, not so much. There are a few songs that are worth a listen and quite catchy, but not the entire album.I do miss them, I hope they'd get their act together, grow some facial hair and make a new album."
4,The Most Authoritative History of the Order Yet Published.,"Hodgson's book is outstanding; a must-read for anyone with a serious interest in early Islamic history generally or in the sect of so-called Assassins particularly. The only shortcoming of this edition is the lack of illustrations (map, tables) that were included in the earlier edition. Hence I gave 4 stars rather than 5."
3,Mellow tunes to set the mood...,"I agree with the 2003 reviewer on the holiday spirit this set provides. Be aware though there are four versions of ""Silent Night"" and ""Jingle Bells"", as well as other multiple carols.The 48 selections are are actually 31 because of repeats by different artists. Nothing makes this compilation really stand out but the recordings dating to 1974 don't show their age. They are ideal easy listening background for what ever Xmas preparations your making or for cocktail hour, dinner etc. If you can get this cheap and your not concerned with superstar performers then enjoy!"
5,Classic R & B,Great selection of songs from the 60's. They still sound great and bring back a lot of good times. If you are a Carla Thomas fan you cannot go wrong with this album.
1,Not happy,I'm not happy with tiisc. I with that Richard wouuld stop makiing an album with the same songs on it. DO NOT BUY THIS CD.
2,"""A Short Course in Nikon Coolpix 990 Photography""","Sorry, I was not impressed with this book ""A Short Course in Nikon Coolpix 990 Photography"" It is fine for the novice trying to understand general photography, but if you are new to digital photography this book makes it hard to understand the Nikon Coolpix 990. The owners manual is much better for explaining, through photos & diagrams, (which this book has few of for the camera) the workings of this digital camera. Also there is no index to this book which I found to be very inconvenient. Stick with the owners manual till a better book on this camera comes out."
1,"VERY misleading, and poor quality too.","These claim to be ""seamless"" but they aren't really.They are three parts: a panty and two legs.The legs are very carefully stitched into the panty, with no seams visible, but they are not all ""one piece"" as claimed.The first time you pull these up, no matter how careful you are, you are likely to separate a leg or two from the panty.If you are a size A, you might order a size E/F and not have them be ruined, but I doubt it.If you did buy them like that, they would not be very comfortable anyway.Definitely not worth the hassle.On a plus note, the seller refunded my money on all three pairs that I bought, even though one pair was totally ruined.Maybe they had had this same problem with other purchasers before."
2,spiderman too large,"This costume runs bigger than the true sizes, therefore my grandson couldn't wear it. Other than that the costume was as good as any of them are and he would have loved it."
4,"Nice ""light mystery""","This book is perfect when you are in the mood for a ""light"" mystery.The book has subtle humor and a solid plot. The descriptions are not too graphic- allowing you to know what has happened without getting gruesome.I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
4,warm me up,We told our two boys we were getting a towel warmer and they hounded us to install. My husband had a easy go putting it in and it works great!. We are going to put the unit on a timer to save on our electric bill. We have used it for a week and love it. The towel are warm and dry. I am hoping it will really come in handy this winter.
4,Towel warmer is the ticket!,"Just what I needed! With limited space, it was difficult for my towels to dry. With the towel warmer, problem solved!"
4,"It's true: warm towels, not hot towels","The reviewers who mention you won't get ""dryer hot"" towels are absolutely right. My towels are sorta warm, and they are dry, but my towels always got dry hanging on the shower rod. The instructions tell you to really put towels on--more towels equals more heat. It seems the towels on top insulate the lower towels, keeping the heat in. Towels on the three middle shelves are warm enough--if you keep towels on top! The bottom towel and the top towel never seem to really get warm. I put a hand towel on top, just for drying hands. I should also mention I'm in Maine, and it's January, so what we want for a hot towel at 5:30am may be quite different from what you're after!Bottom line: Nice enough, I'm not returning it, but it's not worth what I paid. If the unit were $65, then I'd be telling all my friends. As it is, I just say ""eh."""
3,eh...,"Expected a heavier, higher quailty towel rack. It felt light for it's size. Not really a 'polished' nickel finish, more like a silverish painted finish. Hopefully it works better then it looks. Kind of a black sheep it my otherwise Kohler outfitted master bathroom."
5,A Great Addition!!!,We just did a remodel on our bathroom and wanted something that would add to the ambiance of the room. This was just the ticket for the price! Turn it on an hour or so before your shower or bath and you will be wrapped in warmth when you go to dry off. It adds so much without adding to your electric bill.
5,Primary Sources on Lynching,"Given its politically and culturally loaded history, lynching is one of the most difficult topics to teach in American universities. Ginzburg's book makes the job easier by providing the instructor with primary documents with which to examine the phenomenon. In particular, Ginzburg's collection is useful because it draws upon newspaper articles intended for a number of constituencies. Some, directed at racist whites, cheer the lynchings. Meanwhile, black newspapers and those directed at more progressive whites decry the practice. As such, the collection is a perfect tool for examing the place of lynching within various US communities in the latter 19th and early 20th century. Even more excellent when combined with the visual record of _No Sanctuary_."
3,Readable and entertaining,"The hero of this book, Joe Creed, is a sleezebag paparazzo, which is the singular noun for paparazzi. He has few positive attributes. He would do anything to get a good photograph so that he can sell it to the newspapers. He has an ex-wife whom he hates. He even hates his young son. This unendearing character holds our attention because of his complete lack of scruples. What makes this book so satisfying is that, despite himself, he does the decent thing, and at the end of the book, he becomes it's hero. It even has the corps of the paparazzi charging to the rescue like the calvary, which has got to be one of the cleverest twists I have ever read. The book is genuinely frightening. If the end doesn't quite resolve itself satisfactory, then the rest of the book succeeds in carrying you effortlessly from one page to the next."
