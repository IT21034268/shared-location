5,Best oil filters,I have been using Mobil 1 oil filters in my three cars from the first oil change to the last. One Outback has 136K and is going strong. One Baja has 59 is going strong and our new car a Mitisubsi Outlander Sport is fine.
3,1 out of 2 ok,I ordered two of these Eureka Hepa Filters and only one of them was a geniune Eureka product. I returned the other one.
1,Glorified storytelling,"Quite simply, if you want a one-sided glorified overview of Edison's achievements and life, then this book is for you. As is always the case, history is written by the victor (no matter how he won his fame). If you want a real lesson in the history of electricity, and how it affects you to this day - pick up a book about Nikola Tesla."
4,Time will tell,"Good product, seems good quality.However these are destined for impact use so they will have a hard life.Time will tell but these are very good value for money.However yet again another blow moulded case !!!Please listen, we don't like them, they needlessly fill our tool boxes or got straight in the bin.Use a socket rail and vacuum wrap to a piece of cardboard."
2,Just OK,"I got this for my 3-year old son and we returned it the same day. You have to push a button on the frog's back for the letter chips to shoot out and my son couldn't do it. I also had trouble with it! You have to push it hard and fast, and even then sometimes the letters would get stuck in the frog's mouth. It doesn't do much for letter learning either because the frog only ""ribbits"" when a chip comes out. Also, I was suspicious that there was no battery size indicator on the box. Since it didn't come with an instruction manual (which you don't need anyway), I had to open the battery compartment to find that it uses 3 of those small button cell batteries (a little larger than watch batteries). It's a cute idea and my son enjoyed it if I helped him, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great Shoes,"This is my third pair. I tend to wer loafers out pretty fast (Shoeswithin 6 months typically) but these last over two years. They are well made. I switched to these when Rockport stopped selling the style I liked. They were great too, but these last longer than Rockports. Price was great too. I am willing to pay for a good product, and these are good product."
4,What Do We Really Know About Canada?,"""Flight to Canada"" was one of the required reading for one of my literature classes. One debate that came up regularly during class discussions was whether Canada is used by Reed as a literal place or a metaphor as a ""state of mind"". There are solid arguments for both based on the text.For me, it became clear how fuzzy our history lessons were in grade school. We were taught how slaves escaped to Canada. But that's where the story usually ends. Happily Ever After in Canada. Ishmael Reed reminds the reader that there is more to the story."
5,Hot Glove Treatment,This product really reduces the amount of time and work required to make a glove plyable. After using on a new glove 1- 3 times in the first day the glove was easy to close at practice the next day.
5,best way...period.,"I have used this product on the last 4 gloves I have boughten. It is the best way I know to break in a glove. I have easily broken in 30 gloves in my days, nothing compares to this. On a softer leather glove, the process is ussually one time through and you're done. The most recent glove I bought the leather was the hardest I had ever encountered! The 1st time through the glove loosened up alot, after the 2nd and 3rd time through, it was game ready. The glove was a real beautiful color and soft.... Great product, fast and easy! I wont use anything else!"
5,great value,"What can I say? If your soldering wand didn't come with one of these, get one! This is reasobly priced, and a good execution of the classic design. Heavy base so it's very sturdy."
2,"First this isn't a ""triditional vampire""...",I think that is what throws a lot of people off into disliking this film. That isn't why I give it only 2 stars though. While the cinematography is fine and the overall story could have been interesting the execution falls flat. The acting is mediocre and the male lead rather than someone they attempt to make you feel sympathy for just comes off as pathetic instead. It was pretty much a waste of time. I gave it two stars instead of one as there was at least some quality to the film as a whole.
4,"Well, I thought it was pretty good","Jude Law gives his usual outstanding performance. This man has so much talent that it just isn't fair that he is also so pleasing to the eye. But I also found the supporting actors quite compelling in this film about a sort of emotional vampire -- a man who must feed on women who love him. Does seem like he should have had a couple of extra women around, though, in case there is a problem with one. At any rate, his relationship with the police detective who suspects him is really the best part of this film. I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a good thriller and, yes, a vampire movie without the usual amount of blood, etc."
5,The Best of the Books,"Its fun its excitement, it fun, it sad, its happy. If you are a die-hard Transformer fan like me you'll love it. As I said it's everything you'll love. I would have to say it's the best of the best of transformer books. It has an awesome title. I mean look at the title ""The Autobots Secret Weapon"". You don't know if the bad guys going to win or lose. They might win. Most people say ""Good guys always win"", also have you ever heard ""Nice guys finish last"". This time they might just finish last this time. Their special weapon might backfire on them and the bad guys just might whomp them. Well, I'm not going to tell you just have to read it for yourself."
4,Delightful little mystery,"This is my first experience with Maisie Dobbs and I found it delightful. Of course, as an Anglophyle that is to be expected but the author paints vivid pictures of WWI, country fields, WWI injuries....while drawing the reader into a gripping mystery. This is a read for those who love British light mystery."
5,fhopson-Maisie Dobbs 3,The author has created an interesting character in an interesting time - as seen from this time and place. The book is totally engaging and leaves me wanting to know more about the character. I eagerly await the next one.
2,Maisie Dobbs,"Although Jacqueline Winspear is British, ""Maisie Dobbs"" often sounds as if it had been written by an American, so thick with English slang is it. It also has the flaw often found in books set in Britain, but written by Americans, that titles of nobility are entirely inaccurately bestowed.The concept of the book is interesting, but Maisie is a comic-book superwoman. If the characters had been better developed, and the plot less rickety and ridden with coincidence, perhaps the author's impressive research might have been put to a more meaningful use."
2,"Maisie is a cute name, but that's about all !","Maisie was a story about a young woman living during WWI, and the plotline focused on that period. Folks are not too familiar w/that war, and this book did not encourage me to become any more so. It had a subplot of a mystery that was related to the main story, but a long way from Agatha ! I don't know ... I would not buy Book Two in the series."
1,Impossible to read,"It's a nice watch, but the face is too dark to read unless you're standing under a lamp. I had to return it."
4,Milk=good; Beer=bad; Crucial Youth=hilarious sXe fun,"ahhh...this one brings back some memories. in an age where bands were seriously touting themselves as the most ""positive"" band ever (now what the hell could that possibly mean?)...comes this joke band that satirizes every harcore, posi-core, sXe band that ever existed up to 1988. the really funny thing is that Crucial Youth outplay every one of those bands that they are making fun of...beating them at their own game. this music was at a time before terms like ""metalcore"" and ""mathcore"" existed. this is really just straight up hardcore with lyrics promoting dental hygiene, good grades, and condeming (beyond the drugs and drinking) acts of littering, and profanity. the comics inside the booklet are as hilarious as the lyrics and are probably really really funny if you were ever once straight-edge in your past...you sellouts!!! you betrayers of the XXX brethren!!! haha. time for a drink."
2,Book arrived!,I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased a copy for a gift. The book arrived promptly and in good condition. Sadly this copy was a barebones copy without the introduction. The introduction provides background and helps the reader really understand the context of the story. I returned it.
2,I thought the charachters were depicted as ruthless snubs.,It wasn't what I expected after the movie and I would like to see a different author take on this task of writing it.
4,Pure hilarity,"If you love black comedy, this is the film for you. Terribly offbeat and irreverent, but attains an addictive quality that is simply irresistible. One of Almodovar's earliest film and one of his best. Carmen Maura is delightful as is the entire cast."
4,Spatial Analysis - Excellent!,Excellent book. Highly recommended. I understood concepts difficult to understand in other books/papers.
2,Cheesy movie from the early 1990's,"This movie is definitely cheesy, with B-rate actors, an awful-looking creature/villain and it looks like something that should have bee made in the 1980's, not 1990. Only see this movie if you want to visualize Stephen King's short story from Night Shift."
5,Great movie,"I'm a big fan of Stephen King & have enjoyed alot of his books & movies. As long as they ship on time & in good condition, like thi one, I have no problem recomending."
3,"not bad, not bad at all!","When I first saw this movie, a couple months ago,I figured that it would be about a serial killer,not a monster. But I must say, I was much more inpressedwith this movie than I thought I would be. The monster waspretty good, the acting was OK, there was not much of a plot,but being a monster buff, that did not bother me that much.If you like this kind of movie, you will want to rent/buy it."
4,good movie,"I thought the movie was really good. there are a couple parts that could have been better, but for the most part it is a really good movie. if you like stephen king movies you will like this one..."
2,"OK for odors, but...","Doing the saturate thing on a 12-hour-old pet stain only spread the stain (color) instead of removing it. The odor seems gone, or nearly so. So, this is a mixed review. I don't think I'll use it again in any case."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"After twice treating a 6 square foot spot with a combined 6 bottles of this product, the smell remained and was just as bad as ever. I followed the directions to the letter and, while initially the smell was covered, as the area dried the smell resurfaced. I eventually had to replace the affected area with a patched in piece of carpet. Had I known how useless this product was, I would have saved myself 3 days of having the room in a shambles and over $30 dollars."
3,The most amazing pet odor remover not a great stain remover,"I have 2 large dogs and one messy four year old child- between the three of them my carpets and furniture are in various stages of disrepair.. I have found this product to be absolutely amazing on Pet Odors- I have a ""Leaky"" 11 year old dog who has started to dribble when he heads outside- this product completely removes the odor- no cover up. Same with general doggie odors on the furniture- leaves a fresh- almost medicinal smell.. I am not as impressed on it's stain removing ability- had zero effect on the red jello stain on my beige carpet.. also, it can be expensive, I found a loveseat requires about 4 or 5 whole bottle for odor removal. Similarly- it takes about one bottle for every 2 ""accidents"" on the carpet."
4,An interesting style that helps move the story,"EYE OF HEAVEN is, by no means, an ordinary Doctor Who novel. Instead of moving from beginning to end, Jim Mortimore chose to tell the story out of order, flashing backwards and forwards using multiple first person narratives.Does it work? Surprisingly so. EYE OF HEAVEN would have been a rather straight-forward story otherwise, involving a long sea voyage and Easter Island's statues. Instead, by shifting back and forth through the story, Mortimore is able to raise the suspsense level in an almost lyrical fashion.EYE OF HEAVEN was Leela's first major outing in the Who novels, and it worked surprisingly well. I wouldn't recommend this style for all books, or for even most stories. For this, though, it worked admirably. The resolution of the plot is a bit flimsy, but the rest is enjoyable enough that it's not as big a deal as it would have been. Lots of fun for the reader who's ready to be challenged."
2,Very hard to follow. Unusual style.,"The main detracting factor of this book is the fact that it is written ""out of order."" That is, it keeps going back and forth, telling events that happened later before events that happened earlier, and then back again. Also, it is written entirely in the first person, though the person from whose perspective each chapter is written changes from chapter to chapter, and one is left to figure out who the narrator is by the context.For those who enjoy experimental types of reading, you might like this book. I found it to be too confusing to be worth the resulting story."
2,Damaged DVD,"I ordered this DVD through Amazon and it was fulfilled by Clove Media.In regards to the review, it took seven minutes to get the disk to download. The movie is ninety-four minutes long, but the first eleven minutes were missing. Throughout, there were jerks, pauses, and skips.I took my wife to see this movie fifty-four years ago so we knew the plot well enough to explain it to our grandchildren--- Quite a dissapointment.The parts of the DVD that were watchable was great---it was only the provider that rates a one-star review."
4,A little seen gritty gem set in Philadelphia,"This was originally called ""Emmett's Mark"" and I saw it at the world premiere at the Philadelphia World Film Festival where it played to sell out crowds. It's a gritty cop drama about a police officer who belives he is dying (a mature and interesting Scott Wolf) and hires someone to kill him before his painful disease takes over his life. Twists abound at every corner and this film, shot in Philadelphia, makes excellent use of the city and has a gritty, realistic feel. The ending is a bit abrupt but the film is well acted (especially by Scott Wolf and by Tim Roth in a tricky role) and well made. Kudos to director Keith Snyder, he should be proud of his debut film. I only wish it got the theatrical release that it deserved. Highly recommended !!!!! 4.5 stars"
4,Good Quality,"You can tell this is well made, it has a good weight to it (not heavy, just substantial) and stands up on its own. The section dividers can be moved to accomodate what you are putting in there. I use it to line up grocery bags, which fit great. It would be even better if it were bigger to hold more.My only criticism is that it is overpriced - almost $60 is just too much. I paid it becuase the other choices had poor reviews and the size of this was closer to what I needed, but it is too pricey for what it is. It lost a star for the price, but just one because it is a really nice organizer. If you are wondering about quality and durability, this has it. Seems like it will last a long time and take a good amount of wear and tear."
5,Great for toddlers,"My 2 year old daughter can't get enough of the Madeline books. I suggest reading Madeline and the Bad Hat before this one so that you know the characters in it, but it's not essential. We read it so much that my daughter is now reciting it back to me."
3,Not too bad... not too good,I watched this in preparation for watching the new movie... The new movie was better I found the old total recall to be a bit silly and gory for me.
5,Excellent Nostalgia Experience in true Hi-Def quality!,"This is by far my favorite Sci-fi action film ever.Bluray quality:video 9/10audio 10/10features 10/10film 20/10I found the video transfer to have grain to keep up to date in today's picture quality, but still a great picture after 22 years.I remember I was 13 years old when this gem was first released on VHS 1990 and many of my classmate friends used to talk about the nude parts of the film back then. XDWow, Nostalgia trip feels like a kid again! I watched this film at least 15 times on cassette VHS, 5 times in DVD quality, now bluray about 3 times on the big home theater PC.This film is a treasure in my movie collection and I look forward to playing the video game episodes on Android OS. Yes, you can use Arnold in the Total Recall android games!"
4,A bleak view of the future where corporate greed rules,"Paul Verhoeven's bleak view of the future that was present in ""Robocop"" continues in ""Total Recall"". In this future corporations make their own rules and are indifferent to the suffering of anybody that stands in their way. One can see both films as devastating satires of Reagan-era America.As with ""Robocop"" Verhoeven indulges in gratuitous violence and grim humour that leaves one with a slightly bad taste in the mouth. Still ""Total Recall"" moves at lightening pace and the special effects are pretty good. There are also lots of nice humorous details included by Verhoeven and a superb score from Jerry Goldsmith."
3,It is okay,Entertaining and action filled with a good story line describes this movie. I liked it overall and would recommend it.
5,A Perfect fantastic movie..,This movie is my most favorite Arnold movie...Perfect scenario and acting..Special Edition dvd is also excellent..It has very original case..I will recommend to everyone..
3,"Schwar-tastic Movie, CRAP Blu Ray","Ok, it's my own fault for not carefully looking into this new Blu Ray thing. I bought Total Recall, one of the best Craptastic Sci-fi movies ever made hoping for some delusional reason that it would look incredible on Blu Ray. It's crap crap crap crap crap on Blu Ray and looks EXACTLY the same on DVD. Try it! Play your DVD copy and then play the Blu Ray. Hmmm, looks the same. Recent films look incredible on Blu rRay but this one looks just awful in comparison. I fell for it. Buyers beware....that's all. Some of the studios are sneaky and are mass producing a first generation of Blu Rays with their middle finger in the air daring us to buy a bare-basics Blu Ray with a transfer done by the AV guy from the local high school. Be careful folks!"
2,Not one of Schwarzenegger better movies,"I really for some reason did not like this movie. Found it kind of boring and just really could not connect with it or the story just did not seem to make sense. This would be at the bottom of my list of favorite arnold movies along with True Lies, at least for the ones I have seen so far. Maybe for the die hard fan to his you could like it but skipping it you will not be missing much.Peter J. Miller"
3,Really?,"I wanted to watch this before the remake and I was quite surprised such a movie was capable of being made in the 80's. As far as story goes, it was quite compelling. But knowing what i know now, some of the science seemed far fetched. And the violence, crazy amounts of violence. The special effects was pretty good for and 80's movie.(edit)Thanks for pointing out, this was a 90's movie. My surprise of the violence still remains."
3,NOT HD!!!!!,"Great movie, but if you own the DVD the blue ray is a waste of money. It's not high definition at all. I have the DVD and blu-ray playing at the same time. I see no difference switching between them. I'm using a 62"" tv and it should show any improvement. (Buy the Blade Runner Blu-Ray disk instead. The picture quality will blow your mind :-)"
2,Awful transfer of great film,"I am writing mainly for those considering purchasing this blu-ray edition of Total Recall. Don't ; save your money. It is the worst transfer I have seen so far. The picture is constantly grainy and ruins what is otherwise a fine film. It is just outrageous that they would market a film in blu-ray in such poor condition. That accounts for the two stars, which otherwise would have been at least four for the film itself. It still holds up very well after twenty years, is superbly paced with nonstop action, and great effects for its time. Unfortunately my laser disc version of this film is better quality than the blu-ray. This is totally unacceptable."
4,A great Verhoeven movie,"As a fan of Paul Verhoeven I like this movie.I like the violence because I think it is very funny.I particularly liked the scene where Quaid shoots the doctor in the forehead making his brains explode out the back of his head and splatter all over the wall.And where he jams that metal rod through that guys face at the end.A great Sci-fi movie for fans of Sci-fi,Verhoeven,And Arnold."
2,Not worth it to be blu ray,"I recived this blu ray version of Total Recall from amazon. To be honest my opinion... it's not worth it to watch with blu ray or pay more than DVD. Graphic isn't change as DVD or DVD is maybe much better graphic I think.I gave 2 stars because of the story I like but compare with bluray version vs DVD version review will be no star for blu ray.If someone never watch this film maybe ok but if already saw it bunch of time before, it will waste money."
4,I have like this movie for years,"I've been a fan of this movie for many years, but only now did I think the picture quality was good enough to purchase, and I really like it. It is a classic movie and if you like Arnold S. you should like this one too."
3,Works in Europe,"Blue Ray Quality decent, can be compared to an upscaled DVD.Film itself is a classic!"
2,Soylent Dick Says: Totally Overdone and Over-rated,"Saw in in a movie theatre. The story got so convoluted and complex, it was difficult to follow what was going on.Also completely over-done with absurd, trashy special effects and violence."
1,Just a bad movie.,"This movie was awful. Unless you like gore, blood, foul language & with poor acting. I guess that is the way they made movies back then. Needless to say the remake was good and thankfully nothing like the original."
3,Total Recall (blu-ray),"This review is not for the movie itself but for the blu-ray edition.If you're an Arnold fan you already the movie is a great action film.The blu-ray edition is very ""grainy"". the picture quality for a blu-ray is just not very good.If I compare it to a TV program like Fringe, Total Recall loses: big time.Although, it was inexpensive (I suppose you do get what you pay for); I still expected a higher quality picture.If you have the old version on DVD it's as good as the blu-ray."
4,A Futuristic Action-Drama,"This is a futuristic story that takes place after the planet Mars has been conquered and colonized by planet Earth. However, a population of rebelliousness mutants threaten to overthrow the ruling administrator.The plot centers around an earth-man called Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who seems to be unhappy with his wife (Sharon Stone) and for no reason other than some urge to go to Mars. He goes to Total Rekall, a business specializing in memory enhancements and takes the trip to Mars as a secret agent.The many sub plots twist and turn but Quaid eventually discovers his real identity.This is a good action movie with good graphics and screenplay."
4,Highly recommendable after bladerunner and minority report.,"Phillip k Dick being the great writer that he was had written some of the greatest sci fi stories that have been put from book to film including bladerunner and minority report and while this is the worst one been put to film it really is'nt that bad infact it's very good to say the least, total recall is certainly one of Arnies greatest films along with terminator and end of days. If you are into the sci fi genre then i'd recommened films along this line especially anything by the inovative Phillip K Dick (from book to film), almost as good as minority report but not quite blade runner."
4,Its a Webkinz!,"Webkinz came up with a great marketing tool. Sell the kids a stuffed animal and get them hooked up with video games on the internet. The games are cute and fun, and some are actually educational. But watch out or your kids will be on the computer for more than is good for them."
4,MURDER AND ATONEMENT,"New on DVD (August, 03), this overlooked, exceptional film strikes an emotional chord with universal truths.Based on real events, LEVITY (Columbia Tristar) stars Billy Bob Thornton as a convicted murderer paroled after serving 19 years in prison. Haunted by his spontaneous shooting of a store clerk in a failed robbery, he craves reconciliation and returns to his old inner-city neighborhood where he encounters a troubled woman (Kirsten Dunst), a mysterious street preacher (Morgan freeman) and the sister (Holly Hunter) of the boy he killed.It's rare that a movie tackles such difficult themes of guilt, forgiveness, reconciliation and atonement with such insight, grace and intelligence."
1,"Good idea, badly executed","Didn't even bother finishing this. Acting is fine - lots of great actors, story just takes itself far too seriously and turns you off quickly. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is very annoying. If you're a fan of Morgan Freeman, it's unlikely you will dislike this movie."
2,Disappointed,"Unlike the other reviewers of this CD, I did not particularly like it. All the songs sound alike, the pace is too slow, and the female lead singer sounds technically-enhanced. There was also an annoying, grainy quality to it. I listen to many New Age groups, but I will not purchase another CD from this one. I listened to it once and then donated it to the public library. On the positive side, it was soothing as I drove home in heavy traffic, but only because the songs were mind-numbing in their similarity."
5,Love this song,Heard this song an the radio and have been looking for it ever since. Want it for a ringtone. The song stays in your head for days.
5,Perfect tool book for foreigner medical guy,"If you don't speak English, and try to start your medical career in a English country. Merriam Webster's Medical Audio Dictionary can help you successful."
3,M C Beaton series,"All of these books are a bit silly and fun to read when you want a little escape. Some of the characters are funny and of course, there is romance, disappointment and true love. Formulaic but habit forming."
3,no standard def dvd,i heard this movie was coming and was excited. why it is being released as a bluray combo is beyond me. i don't own a bluray player and am not going to buy one in the future.
2,"Dolph Lundgren's version of ""Rambo""","I think this was one of Dolph's better movies. It does a pretty good job of representing the factions in Angola. It has a solid plot. Red Scorpion does what its supposed to do, which is make Dolph the savior of the people in Angola while showing off his body. Its unrealistic that one man is going to come along and single handedly end a war thats been going on for years (especially in Africa) but thats why its only a movie."
4,Good Explanation of Abraham,"I thought the book provided a good explanation of the commonality of Abraham to the 3 monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I enjoyed the author's discussions with religious leaders of all three faiths and his trips to various sites in Israel. It kind of bogs down in a couple of places, but overall an easy, enjoyable read."
2,Too Basic for Most Readers,"Feiler's ""Abraham"" is a good book about the father of three religions written for people who have never bothered to read the Book of Genesis. For the totally uninitiated, Feiler gives a summary of the biblical stories. Instead of Feiler's ""Abraham,"" I would recommend first that people read the biblical Genesis. This is a much more interesting and lively book than Feiler's. And second, if you want insight into the same material that Feiler is writing about, read Dennis Shulman's ""The Genius of Genesis."" Shulman's book has more depth, and is as well written as Feiler's."
1,Overly-simplistic. Not a lot of deep theological food here,"More of a cursory overview of Abraham with a watered-down perspective of the big three religions view of this individual, with plenty of glossy descriptions of holy sites and politically-correct ""BCE"" verbage, but not a lot of deep theological content, which was what I was hoping for.Bruce Feiler is no theologan, apparently, and there wasn't much to this book. There have been better works written about Abraham."
3,The common thread between three monotheistic religions,"I think I listened to this book twice, and I still should listen to it again. Bruce Feiler provides so much fascinating information about the three religions that claim to originate from Abraham -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He carefully compares and contrasts the three without pronouncing a ""winner,"" but instead, he repeatedly demonstrates how all three religions depend on the man (or the myth) called Abraham. I was especially intrigued by his exposition of the contradicting claims about Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael that are made by the three religions. It makes you wonder whether we will ever know the historical ""truth."" It's much easier to simply accept your own religion's teachings through blind faith."
2,Oh gosh -- the voice,"This is a review of the audio book, not the book itself. It's hard for me to evaluate the book itself because Bruce Feiler's reading was rendered so horribly.Memo to Bruce: Leave the reading to the professionals. Just because we can endure your voice for a few minutes on NPR does not mean we want to hear you for six hours on the audio book. Feiler has an odd, whiney voice that is painful to listen to. I don't recommend this audio book"
5,Another great book from Jim Bell,"If you liked Complete Idiot's Guide to The Bible, then you'll like this one. I've known Jim Bell from his well-known Christian books, so I'm glad to see the Idiot's people have picked up one of the best for their religion books. He really breaks down what Protestants believe and why in an easy to understand way that doesn't make you feel stupid. I'm going to use this in my Bible class over the summer."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This One,"A friend recently lent me this book for an opinion. As I read the book, I felt a vague sense of unease that was difficult to pinpoint. Some words that come to mind are irresponsible and selfish. It seemed as though she was looking at herself through rose-colored glasses. I am not able to recommend this book to anyone - especially new homeschoolers. There dozens of excellent books out there written by those who have successfully educated their children at home while adhering to a wide range of philosophies. This is not one of them!"
3,"Not great, but not terrible.","This was definitely one of Al's worst albums, but it's still not that bad. Good songs are Living With A Hernia, Here's Johnny, and Christmas At Ground Zero."
3,Big Rig LED,"I'm safisfied with my purchase overall. The pictureshown for it's advertizing is somewhat misleading.The lights on the picture appear to be bolder andbrighter, and in reality their not. However, theydo look nice at night and work as their advertized."
3,Wish they were a bit flatter on fridge,"So, I guess my husband doesn't like all of the picture on the fridge that are held up by magnets. When I was out of town he bought these. They are ok...they don't lie completely flat on the fridge (some of the edges curl) and to be honest, I like the magnets better. I'll probably use these to stuff coupons in or something of that nature."
4,Awesome!,Great magnets! I have them on my fridge right now! They stick well and hold the pictures nicely! Love it!
4,Easy & Simple,Very simple way to make magnetic photos. I like that it is easy to change photos and that it is a sleek look.
5,Great!,"I love having pictures of my family who live far away. My kids can easily ""play"" with the pictures, with out damaging them ...much... (They can reach in and pull them out, so it's not that much protection. But enough). The best thing is that the back is all magnetic, not just a strip or two."
5,Fine Gardening is more than fine for all levels of gardeners,"Whatever skill level you have -- avid gardener to willing accomplice -- Fine Gardening is a good reference and source of inspiration. From the attractive photography and appealing design to informative content, Fine Gardening packs a lot of useful information in a manner that both beginners and experts can enjoy."
2,"A Perfectly Good, Boring, Collection of Stories","If this type of short fiction is hailed as masterful, intriguing, exquisite, etc., then I must be missing something here. Davis is indeed, a good writer, but, I feel nothing for these sketches and the characters that inhabit them. If she is portraying the emptiness that so many people feel today, then she is masterful! But, what strikes me more than anything is a formula that she has contrived to be her 'style' and this leaves me very cold and amused that so many find this type of writing anything more than a mental exercise on the mundane. Her deliberate lack of emotion and endless trivial details in these stories leaves very little in my own mind or heart to mull over. Maybe Lydia Davis has been a housewife too long."
1,Want a digital camera? Picture something else!,"Save your money!!I bought this because I wanted a digital camera, but I didn't want to spend the big bucks. I thought it would be fine for what I wanted. The first group of pictures I took came out fuzzy when I downloaded them. I thought it was just my not knowing how to use the camera.... not the case, the next times I used the camera and downloaded them I got the same thing.Another Feature(?) is the auto shut off. I was on vacation and tried using it for pictures of action. I didn't want the continuous pictures so I used the regular point and shoot mode. When it got to a part that I was wanting to photograph the camera had shut off, causing me to have to go through the whole cycle of setting up the flash, pixels, and the amount of light etc.I will probably end up giving my 9 year old this camera and will buy myself a ""real"" digital camera."
3,Dreary Mystery and Romance,"Lt. Cowen Drake, SAO (Special Agent) for Interfed's Moonchild Forces, has been sent to the desert planet Semay to investigate a series of murders. Priestesses from Semay's two ruling religious factions, Triumphantes and Fideles, are the victims and Drake must find the connections between the two very disparate sects. During his investigation, Cowen must confront his own sad religious history and deal with the fact that he is slipping into love with one of the high priestesses.This was a hard book to finish, the main character is repressed (and depressed) and the entire story sad and dreary. Shinn explores in great detail religious convictions and faith, but there is none of the humor and spark of her Samaria novels. It also didn't help that the solution to the mystery was evident hundreds of pages before the ending."
4,As expected,"Could not beat the price. Using the battery as a replacement for my alarm system. As for its battery life, its too early to tell."
4,old school,4 stars minus one for s***** production. Sounds like it was recorded off a record. Great old school thrash from the UK. If you like obscure thrash pick this up you won't be disappointed.
3,Overpriced magazine,"I have been a subscriber for many years, but for $34.95, it just isn't worth it anymore. Woodwork is a better magazine with more original content. I just can't see putting out this much for an advertising based magazine. Look elsewhere, like used books for lasting content for much less. The magazine has always had an ""east coast"" bias, which is fine, but the lack of diversity of the woodworking styles represented is not excusable in a magazine supposed to be covering the furniture building audience. If you ever can get your hands on some of the earlier copies, you will be amazed at the quality of writers and articles then compared with now.I would recommend Popular Woodworking if you are interested in hand tools and methods. Seems a little fresher these days. Or for a more artistic bent, look at Woodwork magazine."
3,Repeated Content,If you subscribe to more than one Taunton Direct publications you will start to see some of the same content repeated. After getting both Fine Woodworking and Fine Homebuilding I'm not suprised to see similar stories.
1,Poor buisiness practices,"Started my subscription in March of 2008. Got my first copy (April issue) week of April 7th, 2008. Got two more issues (June and February)next week (April 14th.) They had backdated my subscription to January 10, 2008, and had sent me back issues from thier trash bin. I have now gotten six months of magazines in two weeks. I have had them do this also for Fine Home Building and Wooden Boat."
1,Useless and bad for your wrist,"If you have to twist or bend your wrist to use a wrist-saving device, it's safe to say that the device is useless. This thing stands WAY too high even on the lowest setting. It stands a good 2 inches above your average keyboard on its highest setting. This means you have to bend your arm up then back down to type. I would have to prop my keyboard up somehow. To make matters worse, the gel does not give when you rest your wrist on it.This thing is very cheap but it looks well put together.It's a lot bigger than the picture portrays. However, that all becomes moot once you actually try to type with it."
2,Teknno Lost!,"This film's really strange. Tilda Swinton plays four characters; Rosetta/Ruby/Marinne/Olive. One is the creator, the others are clones.A definciency in the clones means that one must regularly go out and have sex with men in order to harvest their semen, which she collects in a condom. Then she takes this back and makes a tea out of it which they all drink from, as well as they inject themselves with another by-product.It's too weird"
4,6 rounds at 14 steps each,If you are a fan of the book and like strategy games then you will enjoy this one. It is made up of 6 rounds of 14 steps each. At the beginning of the round you choose resources and craftsmen to use at the end of the round. A lot of the strategy is determining where to place your master builders so that you get the best resources and therefore receive the most kudos for contributing to the cathedral. The first time we played it took us about 3 hours to go through the instructions and firgure out all of the possibilities. It was fun and challenging but further play will determine if this game is a long running entertainer.
1,Handout Theology Lectures (1-16)),I bought these tapes primarily to get tape # 1 but it was not sent. This disappoints me greatly because I have all the other tapes but tape # 1.
2,Problemas con el envio,Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones. Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados.
1,You Will Be Disappointed If You Are Expecting Music,"This CD is mostly booty bass drum loops with scratches and unmelodic lyrics through a scratch vocoder. If you're expecting this to be like the mellow and disturbingly enchanting One Step Ahead of the Spider, you'll be sorely disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like a sort of noisy, scratchy, fuzzy, repetitive monotone broken up by the one good track (containing a crazy man yelling at some lady), then you will love this CD.Listen to the samples. The samples are indicative of the entire song, since the samples are just looped to fill a track's worth of time.Leave this one on the shelf and go check out MC 900 Ft's One Step Ahead of the Spider. It's quirkier and more original than this."
2,There's much better out there now,"Who picked these songs? For Dominican music, many of them have a strangely Mexican sound. And some of the songs are rather rough-- stress that doesn't fall on the right part of the word, etc. You can do much better than this these days-- try ""Bachata #1's"" for a mix of modern artists (with Monchy y Alexandra and Xtreme heavily represented) or the ""Rough Guide to Bachata"" for a wider selection of more traditional (but still recent) sound. Even ""Bachatahits 2002"" is much better than this disc. Avoid."
3,"Nice Jacket for Price, but substandard Fur Trim","This is a relatively nice jacket for the price, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The fur is somewhat matted and, regardless of my attempts to fluff it, it still looks cheap. This trim really cheapens the overall look of the jacket. With regard to the fit, unlike others who have commented here, it does fit true to size. I generally wear a size 2, so ordered a XS, and it fits well. It is a slightly boxy cut, so don't expect it to be skin tight, but I like a tailored look and this fits the bill. Would have given it 4 stars, but the fur looks like cheap polyester, hence my 3 star rating."
5,Beautiful Jacket!,"After reading the first 2 reviews, I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this jacket. I ordered one regardless because I own other Kristen Blake Jackets that are very nice. I'm very happy that I bought it because it is really a great Jacket at this price----you can feel the cashmere content because it is so soft. I've paid a lot more for jackets that aren't nearly as nice- another great coat from Kristen Blake."
5,Amazing truth and biblicaly sound!,"Any Christian wanting to get closer to God this is essential! You don't need to speak in tongues in order to be saved and have the Holy Spirit doweling in you, however its an essential gift given by God to edify your self and the ones in your heart and around you. Pray to God for the gift if your intentions are pure God will give it to you. Have faith my brothers and sisters God bless you all!"
5,Even more Awesome,I have spoken in tongues in my private prayer life for many years but never to the extent that I have since reading Dave's book! One thing I have found though is that the book is so expensive (even used) that most people would be discouraged from even trying it. I just found out that Dave Roberson offers an eBook online on his website for free! If you want to know more about speaking in tongues and grow in leaps and bounds in your spiritual life I would highly suggest this book!
5,Awesome!,"This Book is AWESOME! My Pastor suggested this book, when I inquired about gaining a closer relationship with God through my prayer life. Dave Roberson, really presented the Gift of Tounges in an awesome way that I know has been broken down for even the believer who has not used their gift yet. This book is so powerful, I have purchased it for several of my friends.If you have questions, concerns, or want to walk in the annointing that God has placed over your life, than purchase this book. God will lead you on the path that you never knew you could walk in."
3,A good introduction on the subject,"This is a beautiful introductory book on the subject. I recommend it if you still need to discover what crop circles are. Many pictures are really beautiful and left me speechless.But if you already know something about crop circles and want to know more, this is not where you will find it."
1,Crop Circle Hoax,"The VERY FIRST crop circles were made by pranksters with ropes and boards. They have video taped footage of themselves doing it. Did the aliens then pick up on and improve on this method of ""communicating"" with pretty circles, or is it all just a big hoax that certain conspiracy addicts refuse to see?Open your eyes. It's a joke."
4,Great book for a great price.,"Brian Bower does it again with a great Leica book. Many color photos taken by summicrons, summiluxes, and most other Leica lenses on mostly Kodachrome 25 and 64. Great book on how to use the Leica systems to take landscape and cityscape photographs for optimal results. Highly recommend."
1,A Dog in name and quality,"Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets."
5,Oh! Heavenly Dog,"I highly recommend this video for people of all ages. I first recall seeing it when I was a young girl and the love for it is as strong now as it was then. It has a unique storyline littered with mystery, suspense, and humor, as well as a star cast with Omar Sharif, Chevy Chase, Jane Seymour, and let's not forget Benji. This is a movie the whole family will love!"
3,Third Double,"After Chicago broke through with their second album, the band released a third consecutive double album that was another success on the charts. Despite peaking at number two (two places higher than II), the album is probably the most overlooked of Chicago's 70's albums. This is mainly due to the absence of any top ten hits (""Free"" & ""Lowdown"" cracked the top forty) and none of the songs became staples of the band's repitore. That's not to say III is without merit. The album has fine moments including the two singles, ""Free Country"" and the Travel Suite."
5,"Beats ""modern"" rock everytime",I was at one of their concerts recently and was reminded just how good their music is. It was nice to be able to get a fresh copy of this CD. Now I can have one at home and in my car.
1,Why is this Widescreen film in Full Screen format????,"This film contains the best performance of Jessica Lange's auspicious career hands down. This was also American audiences introduction to the wonderful Armin Mueller-Stahl in the role of Lange's father. Thank goodness I saw this film on the big screen, and then later on the Widescreen Laserdisc. I have never seen this film panned and scanned, and i refuse to now, even though it has been released on DVD. So, unless Artisan Home Video intends on re-releasing this outstanding film in the correct 2.35:1 aspect ratio and in the 16x9 format, they are not getting my money."
4,WHAT WERE THE DISTRIBUTORS THINKING?,"I own this film on Laserdisc. It is in WIDESCREEN 2:35 anamorphic presentation. I once saw a VHS version in full screen. Awful! In a world where widescreen and 16x9 are common even for the most dopiest of films that Hollywood puts out, didn't anyone have the sense to care about its original aspect ratio? Guess not.I did find a region 2 PAL DVD version from Spain that does offer it in WIDESCREEN; runs about $29 with shipping. I ordered it because it's unlikely this film will be redistributed here in widescreen anytime soon. Classic film with great performances."
5,Xcalibur's,I am really enjoying the CD. I love the Rocky soundtrack. If this soundtrack doesnt motivate you with whatever your doing then you dont have a beating heart.. Love it from beginning to end
3,Music of determination despite my rating,"This collection contains hits from all the Rocky movies. It includes the theme for the solemn training Rocky underwent in Russia, as well as uplifting songs of ultimate truimph. My rating of 3 is due largely to the fact that many of the instrumental Rocky tunes are synthesized"
4,Good experience,"This book was tough to find, but got to me in time to use in my classroom. It was in good shape and arrived quickly. Great artwork and story."
4,Great Read,"This was a good book, very informative. The history of Texas has always fascinated me, and this book has many stories of the open range, cattle rustlers, and the mysterious ""Spanish Curse"" that seemed to spread from the Longhorn cattle of Texas to the rest of cow country"
1,not bad.....for kindling,"I bought this item from some other online seller.It's useless, except for kindling. It burns very well.Expensive kindling though.If you still buy this item EVEN after all these true, accurate, and frank reviews, then perhaps you deserve it.Live long and prosper!"
5,Grandes canciones!,Esta coleccion contiene tres discos compactos. Son unos discos extraordinarios y mas aun por el precio. Se pueden escuchar las mejores canciones de Alejandro Fernandez en sus inicios. Se los recomiendo a todos los aficionados a la musica de este popular cantante mexicano.
2,RJ-45 connector broke first time used.,"The cables were received and not immediately used. A few weeks later, I unwrapped one and carefully inserted it into an Ethernet switch. The retaining clip on the RJ-45 connector immediately broke off. Now I have to be very careful not to pull on the cable as it will pull out of the Ethernet switch socket. Otherwise, it seems to be a fine cable..."
3,Make sure you need it,"The price was good, but I ended up not using this cable. The one that came with the router was long enough for my needs."
2,Wrong Color,The cables are fine but the wrong color was sent. I ordered black and the order stated they were black but when I opened the box they were blue.
1,Not So Fast!,"I ordered what I thought were ""Cables To Go"" brand, but what I received was another type that I do not recognize. There's nothing wrong with this particular cable; it is just not what I ordered in the first place. Apples and oranges are not the same fruit, either."
2,Item received was NOT Cables To Go,"The cables that I received from the vendor ""Ucable"" were not ""Cables To Go"" brand, and they were not the same at the cables pictured. While the cables may have similar specifications, I ordered ""Cables To Go 31342 Cat6 550 Mhz Snagless Patch Cable, Black (5 Feet)"", and that is what I expected to receive. This seems to be a regular problem with Marketplace vendors. Unfortunately, the Amazon Marketplace vendors are making Amazon.com look bad and turning my lengthy experience with Amazon into one that is starting to feel more like eBay."
4,Not really Cables To Go!!,"Product arrived on time. But, not really Cables To Go as advertised on Amazon. Well, so far, it seems to be working fine without any let-up. I think I'll keep it. Amazon should be specific about what's being advertised and being sold."
4,Good price for a good product,"They satisfy the need for faster communication in the home network, as well as the newer high speed modem didn't say it needed them, but there is an improvement."
1,Seller Shopcloseouts is shipping a different brand item!,"Although these MAY be fine quality, they ARE NOT what I was expecting to receive.They are advertised as ""Cables To Go"" (CTG) CAT 6 patch cables, and what I received is NOT a CTG product. They are ""Made in China"" (maybe CTG are too), NO brand name on the package, and are definitely NOT in a CTG package, as I also ordered 5 foot cables at the same time, and those ARE in CTG bags.BEWARE that you may not get Cables To Go brand."
1,bait and switch,"The cable they sent WAS NOT ""cables to go"" cable they advertised. It is some cheap generic branded ""cablemaster"" on package, but no marking at all on cable. Do not trust these guys!"
2,Product sent is not what is depicted,"The picture of the blue CAT6 cable is not the same as what was received. I specifically ordered this new cable due to the fact that I prefer the ""Snagless Protector"". The items ordered is depicted as having this ""Snagless Protector"" yet arrived with the older, less user friendly style protector. This may seem trivial if all you're looking for is a CAT6 patch cable. It works fine like that. I specifically color code my network and want it to look and function in a certain way in addition to performing well.Had I been sent what I thought I was ordering I would be thoroughly satisfied."
3,Great cable...,"Great cable, the mine came broken thought, 10,000 cables and I got the only one broken :S, Well it is an excelent cable, I got bad luck, that's all, I don't mind to send it back to get a new one because It is more expensive to pay the shipping than buy a new cable lol.I'll buy another one soon."
5,Step-Up To Cat 6,"Decent quality. Solid connection. Affordable, and a good value for the money. I had some Cat 5 cable previously, and with this there is a noticeable speed increase, even while streaming video on another computer over the network. I've ordered a couple additional patch cables as a result."
3,C2G/Cables,What you see and read about is what you get. I had purchased a wirless router and decided I could use this also. It works like it should and have no problems what so ever with it. Its a good product.
5,"Good cable, good price",I needed to run cable from router to a downstairs video setup and this works great. Faster and more reliable than wireless.
5,Perfect,"The right product arrived when it was supposed to in perfect working condition.What more could you ask for, eh?"
5,Good quality cable,"It's hard to write a review of Ethernet cables since there's really only one thing they can do. Knowing that, these cables do their assigned task very well. It provides a solid connection between my computer and cable modem, with no issues to speak of."
5,Exactly what I needed at a great price,What can you say about 1ft patch cables? Either they work or they don't.I ordered these patch cables by Cables to Go over 2 years ago and they are still going strong. I love the snagless heads (I always seem to break the non-snagless ones) and the quality of the cables. Sure I could have made my own for cheap but I've spent enough time creating cables to know that it gets old fast. Definitely worth it to me. Highly recommended!
1,Not what I ordered,"As with many other purchasers recently, these cables are not what the picture shows and are not Cables To Go. These are not snagless.I do no think these are Cat 6 cables either, since they boost only 100mbps. I switched out this cable with a Belkin I have 5e, and get 1.0Gbps.These cables were cheap, so you get what you paid for.I hate getting third party merchandise through Amazon, there always seems to be an issue with quality."
5,It stole my heart.,Why do people think that every novel by Andrews is only based on incest? It's about the emotional struggles within a family. I asked a friend to read this book and she said no because she thinks it's dirty. That's a shame because it is an exceptional story. My sister and I talk about Andrews books like they are real life. THEY ARE SO ADDICTIVE!!!!! I LOVE THEM ALL!!!!
3,What is it with the incest?,"Okay, had this book not included the brother, Chris, raping the sister, i would have really liked it. It was well written, had a great plot and excellent characters. I thought the incest between the mother and father was a good part of the storyline, it was relevant and set up the situation well, but I think the brother/sister thing was uncalled for.Alright, but a little too OTT (over the top)"
2,I LIKED the grandmother!!,"It is probably because I read Seeds of Yesterday, first. I totally understand her personality flaws, not of her own doing.I can also understand why she hated her spoiled daughter and her inbred incestious grandchildren. Why did she have to put up with them? They proved her to be right in the latter books, they were selfish, mentally imbalanced and evil."
4,"If you haven't read this yet, shame on you!","I could not put this book down! There are some parts that are slow reading but the other parts make up for that. It is interesting to read how the children kept themselves busy while locked away in a room for years. Also, it shows how money can change people and V.C. Andrews showed this well in the mother of the children. I enjoyed the ending because it had a little twist that was just enough to make you go ""holy crap!"". I look forward to reading the other books by V.C. Andrews."
3,"A very.... different book, indeed.","I must admit, ths book was very... ironic. Ms. Andrews is a good writer, the way she writes is legible. But, what she writes about is... weird. This book freaked me out a little, because: Could someone be that harsh and imprison 4 innocent siblings in an attic? The fact that the two oldest siblings committed incest was beyond gross. Their parents committed incest themselves, so I see why those two ended up following their parents' footsteps. I really, really felt sorry for the twins. Especially that little boy, because he was killed! If Ms. Andrews took out the whole ""incest"" event, I would have rated this book as ""*****"". This book was full of suspense, and I must admit I couldn't put it down. (Besides going to the bathroom and going to bed.) If you like to read different books, I guess you should read this. :)"
5,"Stacey N. Miller Place, NY",I highly recommend Flowers in the Attic if you like to read about mystery and adventure. The book Flowers in the Attic was a outstanding book. I enjoyed reading this book because it left you with cliff hangers at almost every chapter that made you want to keep on reading. I also liked the book because the ending was a surprise to me. I never thought that was how the book would turn out. The book also gives you very vivid descriptions of the characters. I felt like I knew the characters personally as I was reading about them. The way the author describes the setting of where they are in the book also painted a vivid picture in my head.
5,Great Book for anyone who likes thrillers.,I loved the way Andrews tells about her characters. She really lets you know whats going on in this book. I've read a lot of V.C Andrews and this is a great book.
5,"GREAT, I couldn't put it down.","This book is so great it makes you want to cry, scream, it can make you happy, angry everything, you should get it, I couldn't stop reading.!"
5,"Wow, I was blown away!","About 15 years ago, when I was a teenager, my best friend and her mother were into all things VC Andrews. I saw part of the movie ""Flowers in the Attic"" several years ago, and recently decided to see just what all the hubub is about.I just finished this book, and am blown away! This tale of greed, deception, love and hate will send you on an emotional rollercoaster right along with all the main characters. The characters truly come to life, as you sympathize with them some times, and get annoyed with them at others - just like your own friends or family. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you want to start (as I now am) a mission to ""catch up"" with all the VC fans and read all of her books in chronological order."
4,Interesting and captivating story!!,"Although this is my first V. C. Andrews novel, I found myself caught up in the story from the very beginning. At times, the story seemed difficult to believe, I found myself anxious to read the next chapter. I particularly like the devolpment of the children through a ""normal"" lifestyle and watch it transform into a ""nightmare"" lifestyle. The children's gullibility is exploited with the reader questioning how these poor kids could be treated this way. I disliked some of the Chapters which seemed to basically fill space serving no real purpose to the overall story(i.e. Holiday's Chapter, etc). Despite my dislike, I have quickly started reading the next book in the series. I found this book difficult to put down."
5,Oldie but goodie,I remember reading this when it first came out. Very inappropriate content. Language spoken by characters not realistic for their age. But...an easy quick read. Makes you want to read the rest.
1,1 Star for DVD; 3 for the Movie,"I won't bother reviewing much of the actual film other than that i think the 2 halves of the movie never really gel together like they're supposed to (or are they?). Transfer of film to DVD is pretty grainy in some scenes(the nighttime ones). The back of the box claims ""animated menus"" but all i saw were standard NON-animated menus. I also found this DVD to be very skimpy in extras. For example, there's no director's commentary. Probably the worst thing is that the deleted scenes are excluded from the disc. The original version of the film was roughly an hour longer and featured another vignette featuring James Van Der Beek. Todd Solondz was apparently upset over the producer's cuts and blamed them for the film's lukewarm response. So where are the scenes that would complete Solondz vision? Apparently, not on this disc."
3,movie,The first story is this film was very good. The second part was boring and therefore I changed the channel. Leo is a wonderful actor and so is Selma. Hope to see them do another movie together some day.
2,Full of itself,"I'll keep it short: Pointless. Dull. The first story was shaping up as quite interesting, and then it was over. The second was never interesting. In fact, the best thing in the second story was seeing the stoner from the documentary ""American Movie"" playing the documentary cameraman! Unfortunately, that was the funniest part of the story.Rent ""Happiness"". A MUCH better film."
3,A TIP ...,"... for keeping knives sharp in the bolock, insert them upside down. The blade won't rest on the block."
2,Bad investment!!!,I read the reviews and it seemed like this knives were worth the $59.99 I paid in August 2002. (Notice the price now!!) Now I regret having bought this set. The block and the knifes look very pretty and even work ok at first. But then even w/o washing them in the dishwasher not even 4 months later I'm noticing rust spots on them. Also they are becoming increasingly dull and the sharpener that comes w/ the set is good for nothing.
1,Poor quality,"This is the worst set of knives I've ever owned. They're quite stylish but that's the only positive thing about them. Dull, dull, dull...right out of the box! A complete waste of money. My Farberware knives from Walmart are way better than these."
4,Hanged on a Twisted Cross,Really it was written in the bible that it was a torture stake and/or a tree and not ever written that it was a cross. The tale of the cross was presented in the 3rd or 4th century. But then again we can see how the wolves stepped in after the last disciple died and twised God's words to fit in the wolves ways of teaching the bible.
1,DA1,"Not a very good rpg game, or maybe it's not an rpg game at all.no dialog quest or ???????,just fighting your way from point A to point B"
3,Not sure...,"Well the item arrived in about 5 days wich was good. The movie was brand new and seemed to be in good condition. The only thing is that when i played it it got stuck several times, i checked the disk and noticed it was a bit scratched from some areas. I dont think the movie was scratched since the beginning. It was shipped in a padded envelope and i think the disk must have been rubbing against the box during the whole shipping/delivery process. So i just wish it had been shipped in a small box."
1,In my opinion dint like it,"I respect every step up fan but i dint like it, it was a bit slow and borring at the same time."
4,Enjoyable :-0,"Aside from the average acting, this is a really enjoyable, fun movie. It's mostly predictable, but it's full of great dancing and a nice story line. Mario is super hot in here (although he isn't a lead actor in this) and Channing Tatum is good (I've loved him since Coach Carter). There is fantastic music and while the movies main appeal is directed at teens and 20 somethings, I think everyone who loves dancing and good music will appreciate this movie."
3,pleasantly surprised by this movie,"i saw this with my kids and had low expectations. this is not the first tough guy meets upper class girl and fall in love thru dancing movie. having said that, we all were pleasantly surprised. Channing Tatum is solid & appealing in the main role and the story packs enough action and momentum to keep it going. has some rough language and violence (thus PG-13 rating)"
3,Step Up,"There is a good story line. However, the relationship between Channing Tatum and his ""friends"" is a bit too adolescent and could have been staged in such a way that there is more of a meaningful relationship between Channing and his dance partner and less animosity from his friends because he is interested in a more meaningful artistic education and relationship."
4,Dancing is amazing,Movie was very entertaining and the dancing was excellent. My major complaint is that the story line is just way too cliche.
1,Book is a misprint,There was an error in the printing of this book. The last 60 pages of the story are not there. Instead the previous 60 pages are repeated. (The story itself is great!)
3,Check the Return Policy,"I received this robe for Christmas. The quality was fair; however it had threading was loose in many places. It also had no inside tie to ensure proper closure. I wanted to return the item...The company was very strict on the return policy even after I contacted them via email...They only allow 30 days for a return, even during the holiday season. They also required the item in original packaging, with a receipt... I feel this was an unreasonable request for an online retailer, especially over the holiday. Bottom line be sure you want this item if you order it..."
5,he Very Best of Anne Murray,I just Love Ann Murray and listening to her Music is ever so joyful. She is do delightful to listen to.
4,basic comprehensive book,the book enables you to view and intrigue yourself with many different techniques. recommended as a book for the intermediate level.
3,Should have been called metal smithing,"As someone who makes a lot of wire/clay jewelry but doesn't work with metal, torches etc...this book will probably just collect dust. Everything in here required special tools I'm not interested in buying. Maybe if you have some knowledge of working with metals you could find this very useful but for me it was a waste of money. I used just one tip in book and the pictures did not inspire me to learn more."
3,Good review,Kept me busy for a couple of hours. Describes the principles of jewelry making without the in-depth technique descriptions I am looking for.
2,Disappointing,"When I started this book I thought I'd be able to recommend it as a light, fun read about the goings-on in a small town. It pulls you in and makes you want to find out what will happen to each of the people who have a storyline of their own. But by the end, the light, fun tone gives way to darker truths about each person, often involving explicit, and in some cases, disturbing sex acts. By the time I had finished the book I decided that I wouldn't want to be next-door neighbors with the author, who apparently creates sordid fantasies behind every person that he meets, or at least every person he sees fit to write about. I was disappointed by this book and would not recommend it to others."
4,Shades of Lake Wobegon,A good comedy. Living all my life in Michigan and the past twenty a transplant from the big city to a small town the story really clicks. Each page has the idiosyncrasies that abound in a small town. Each person is a work of their own and the difference is you see them everyday. His characters are well positioned and all come together to make this a very good novel portraying small town life perfectly. A good book to read no matter where you may live.
2,So-So,"I subscribed to American Patchwork Quilting magazine for over a year, and to be honest I found it mediocre. The projects seem to be designed for people with 'high end' sewing machines and there are way too much appliqué projects, advertisements, and modern-looking quilting projects.I'm an intermediate quilter, and the majority of the quilts featured are A: too easy B: seriously complex or C: way too contemporary. There seems to be no middle ground and few projects for those who like to make quilts that are more traditional looking. In fact this issue (October), features a huge article for some textile designer which isn't even about quilting or piecing. Bleh.For this price I'd expect less adverts, more blocks, and more projects a traditional piecer might enjoy. 2 stars."
4,Saxon Algebra I,"I have used Saxon Algebra for many years. It is one of the most compreshensive algebra texts, with easily understood lessons, a excellent testing program, and plenty of review of all concepts. I like the bite size portions of a concept, followed by lots of practice. My students are well prepared for college math when they have completed the program. They also do well on the SAT tests as a result of the teachings."
3,"Okay, but break easily.","These glasses are very thin and very light. I carefully washed them by hand, and one still broke. If you're looking for glasses to use a lot, consider a different set.Otherwise, they are very nice looking."
2,Good story but unevenly told.,"Well, this book is from 1939. It is broken up into three parts (and this is not a long book). Some of the language is archaic and you need to turn the page and turn the page to read some of the sentences. Andy checks out a book about lion and the adventure begins. The lion and Andy come in contact at the start and at the end of the book. While this book has been around a long long time, there are definately better books out there. However, if you are yearning for an old children's classic, I recommend it, but not highly."
5,great review book,this book is very useful to prepare for PTCE.I think it is a great tool to understand how an exam works and what to focus on
2,NOT a 'Study on You Own' Review,"This book would probably be a good review IF and only IF you have a hard text that goes along with it or you have attended a school for pharm tech for 2 yrs. This is a workbook ONLY and it doesn't explain the answers and some of the questions involve things that is I have never heard of and there was no way to figure it out without another source to go to. So IF you buy this book, make sure that you have the text book that goes along with it (and I don't know what that is) because if you are studying pharm tech on your own and you haven't gone to school for this, you will be disappointed because it is not a teaching book for review."
1,NO CASE,"I WAS GETTING READY TO PURCHASE THIS ACCORDION, WHICH WAS GOING TO COST ME OVER A $1000 DOLLARS. THEN I NOTICED THAT I WOULD BE RECIEVING A GIG BAG INSTEAD OF A CASE. I FEEL ANYONE PURCHASING AN INTRUMENT THAT COST OVER A $1000 DOLLARS, SHOULD RECIEVE A NICE HARD CASE TO PROTECT IT."
1,Half truths and scare tactics,"I feel this book hurts the message that using alternatives to traditional medicine should be explored. This is one of many examples throughtout the book. On page 22 ""In real numbers, this means that for every 1,000 women using one of these drugs, 300 will eventually develop breast cancer from the HRT itself."" This sounds very scary but is flat out wrong. A 30% increase in risk is not a 30% risk as this book implies. In real numbers this means that instead of 100 women out of 1000 developing breast cancer 130 women out of 1000 would develop breast cancer on HRT. Not to mention that a lot of studies do not show such a high increase in risk. How can anyone trust the assertions of this book if in the first 22 pages there are such blatant untruths."
2,Don't waste your money,"There are many more worthy books on the Manson case out there then this one. I patiently waited for publication, and was hugely disapointed in the whole book. It is an excellent music history but as far as anything on Manson goes it is just the same old same old...full of factual errors that even someone new to the case would spot...Save your money and either borrow a friends copy (if they're unlucky enough to have purchased it) or borrow it from the library where I am sure no one will steal it as they have all the good books on Manson..."
4,Nice little scanner - very good value.,"Having owned and installed many scanners, I wanted a new simple scanner for my private office. The Epson 610 installed instantly with the included usb cable, and I was scanning within 5 minutes. It's fast, and the bundled twain driver works well. Even the basic OCR software works well for basic word processing - but you might want to install a high-end OCR software like Textbridge Pro for more options. Color photos scan well, but you get far better color if you don't choose the 'quick scan' option."
4,THANK U,"tyler perry did his thing with this one here..the message was great,the cast was so so(i was happy 2 see the one time prince singer ""tamar"" come out and work good in this one..overall it was a good play"
3,the Marriage Couselor,"I'm a Tyler Perry fan, but his one was too edgy for me. He is brilliant and could have gotten his point across without crossing the line. All his work has makes good points."
3,just ok,"in my opninion, this isn't one of his best plays. it was just ok. the acting could've been better and it wasn't that funny. the funniest character was the father (he's on house of payne)."
5,"""A MUST"" FOR ANY FAN OF UNDERGROUND METAL",These guys rock!!! It is really great to see that this CD is available on amazon.com !!!
2,not as good as others..,I purchased the 5 DVD set by LeapFrog which teaches letters and the sounds they make. The purchase of the Rock and Sound dvd was more for the grownup's - so we could get a break from watching the LeapFrog! However this one (nor any others purchased since) can compare to the LeapFrog set. My grandson is 3 1/2 and it didn't take very long for him to pick up the names of the letters and the sounds they make. The LeapFrog set really excited him - so I recommend that set - skip this one.
3,Buy the $9 Letter Videos,"This was one of three letter videos I bought for my four year old son. I had high expectations for this video since it cost twice as much as the others. In my opinion it was no better than the others and more importantly, it wasn't a favorite of my son. He watches Leap Frog Letter Factory ($8.99) over and over again but doesn't care to watch this one again."
4,"A Very Good Album, but the mood may come off smarmy","No question that this album was produced immaculately. It sounds great and is mellow, soulful and romantic. If you're in the right mood for this stuff you'll eat it up. When I'm not I find it can come off as smarmy since Brian Ferry's vocals can seem overly suave sometimes.Definitely a highlight of 80s music, which I think those not intimately familiar with it will chalk up to bands like Depeche Mode, The Smiths and Culture Club and look no further for the stuff that was more original and less overplayed by the 80s revival movement. If that's all you know about the 80s you need to explore this album along with many others that are timeless and much under-appreciated.It's mellow, so don't expect to get the adrenoline pumping. If you don't like mellow and romantic music then don't bother buying it. But it's one of the best romantic albums in the past 30 years. And I'm not talking about boy-band commodity velveeta."
3,It works as advertized but there is an issue with Win XP,"I purchased this card for my Dell c800 laptop together with D-Link's DWL-5000AP access point. For the most part, it works out of the box and installs flawlessly. However, this card does not appear to be fully XP compatible. The drivers available for it are quite ""old"" (April 2002) and ARE NOT CERTIFIED XP COMPATIBLE. This card is not ""hot-swappable"" as it will cause XP to blue screen if you pop it out of the slot without stopping it. A call to D-Link support confirmed this along with the fact that they have still not received certification from Microsoft. I would stay away from this product until they do."
3,Interesting but not killer,"The movie is well done. Not predictable. Not satisfying in a visceral way, but thought provoking. I would recommend it."
2,Not this time,"I am a big fan of this series.Not this time. Basically, this book is all about how our main character wants to get engaged to her- now - long term boyfriend. Fine - except that he never asks and this, in turn, just keeps freaking her out.So, instead of either ""sucking it up"" and moving on - she keeps expecting him to pop the question - at every turn and I mean at every turn. Basically, the author ends up making our heroine so pathetic that she becomes this complete turnoff.Every page and every paragraph includes the words: ""I know he is going to ask today"".... and this becomes so tedious. You want to scream ""Either ask him or move on"" just please put us out of our misery.I did not enjoy this book. The main character was wishy-washy and portrayed as a victim (if I don't get engaged I am nobody). There was no fun in reading this book for me and let's not even talk about the total lack of humour here.Pass on this one - please."
2,Slightly Crappy,I thoroughly enjoyed the first and second book in this series (especially the first) but this book became a chore to read. In every page we have the main character whining about 'when is he going to propose'? I wanted to scream! It became predictable and thoroughly boring after the first couple of chapters. If Wendy Markham plans on making a 'slightly married' or 'slightly pregnant' I certainly hope she takes all this bad feedback onboard and comes up with a more witty and original novel!
2,So Boring,This is my first review & I was afraid everyone else was going to like this book & I was going to wonder about my reading preferences. I am going to look for the first book in the series since others liked it.I never felt like I connected at all with Tracey or Jack. His character was so boring! I kept waiting for something fun or exciting to happen. It never does. I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end.
4,Decent protection if you dont mind 1-2 tiny bubbles,Its crystal clear and quite tough. Offers definite protection.But its quite hard to get on cleanly without bubbles. I have 2 really tiny bubbles in the corners but it doesnt really affect gameplay or visibility.Best thing is that the screen protector is almost invisible when the psp is turned on.
3,DEAD PIXEL,"the screen worked great, despite having a dead pixel dead center of the screen. its not too noticeable so I'll live with it."
5,Magic!,"I won't do a synopsis, that's already been done. I just wanted to say that I love this movie, it is full of magic and hope. I am envious of the ability to just take off and drive across country to pursue an impulse. I love seeing the ghosts from another era come out and interact with the family. When Burt Lancaster's character comes off the field and gives up his dream for a second time, it speaks to the goodness of mankind. Except for some language, I would have no problem showing this to my kids. I now have in-laws in Iowa and Minnesota and I sure wish I could go visit the baseball diamond and am tempted to look up Chisholm when we go to visit. I'm asking for the DVD for Christmas!"
4,A Great Film,"I loved it. I don't generally care for Kevin Costner, but he is actually OK in this one. Like the film. If you love baseball....you'll love this flick."
2,HD DVD Review,"Amazon, are you going to post my review?The HD Quality is not that great for as good of a movie as this is."
1,Movie for Simpletons,"Not an emotionally authentic moment in this movie. It's scary, and tells you a lot about America, that so many moviegoers are bowled over by this treacle. No wonder the booboisie want to put Ronald Reagan's mug on Mt. Rushmore. They fall for anything."
5,Very spiritual DVD,"I was moved by what I thought would be ""fluff"" -whoever wrote it-and the actrors who played in it -""got it""."
5,One of the best; bring a hankie!,"I have this marvelous movie on VHS and adore it, but know I'm missing alot. So I've ordered it on DVD which has English sub-titles, and know I'll enjoy it even more. The story is gripping, touching, and makes one think, ""Why not??"" The ""dead"" are all around us, but it was Ray (& wife 'n' daughter) who was blessed to be able to see and communicate with them. I agree with all the comments from previous reviewers, and in spite of bits of humor here & there, I repeat, bring a hankie for the end."
1,These are junk pantyhose,"I have always wanted a pair of back seam pantyhose,when I found these I thought,why not.The seam runs down the back of the leg,around the calf to the front and top of the foot,like a corkscrew,these are the lamest pantyhose I have ever had,the seam running around the outside of my leg looks really stupid,and because the foot is molded into the pantyhose,the direction of the seam cannot be changed.I'll stick with the old reliable no nonsense pantyhose,at least I know what I'm getting when I buy them,and they never have that rediculous seam problem,Hue I'm really disappointed."
1,not worth it,I'm so glad I ordered two because the first package I opened immediately as I carefully put my pantyhose on...a snag appeared...second pack went on with out a problem but unfortunately can only wear them one time and out the trash they go. I rather go to an actual store and purchase these as it's a problem having to return them via amazon. I will definately not purchase this brand again. Not worth it.
1,black WII covers,THIS COVER DOES NOT COME AS IT APPEARS! and the nunchaku skin does not fit! Don't buy it. waste of shipping and handling money!
3,"Debut Is Okay, But Nothing Memorable","This is the debut album from ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, containing parodies of songs that include Mickey, I Love Rock And Roll, My Sharona, and Another One Bites The DustA lot of these songs are pretty humorous, as they are supposed to be. On this one though, there's not really any songs that are memorable like the ones off of his later albums. My favorite tracks are Gotta Boogie and My Bologna. The song Another One Rides The Bus seems to have been crudely recorded with a relatively low quality, but it is the only song on the album that sounds this way.Overall, I'd say only pick this album up if you are a ""Weird Al"" purist or it is on sale. There isn't a whole lot on this CD to make it worth an everyday pickup."
1,Alphabet,"this item did not work ...it arrived defective..the sender returned my money....i was happy with that....had to toss the dvd,...no idea how good or bad it was"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Thought that a movie produced by Ms Lee would be better than the one she sang in.Guess I was wrong.Though it was purchased in the USA, it seemed to be a voice over, as the lips did not often match the words.Also when he flied from Hong Kong to Thailand, why was the airplane a Southwest?Sort of wondered why the action scenes did not look staged but had contact violence.Of course the action scenes were prime for the over 3 hour movie.Long and drawn out like an after-school special."
1,another problem device,"I echo other complaints about the DWL520. The connection is made with very good signal strength and quality. However, the device refuses to make any throughput. It would almost never successfully load a page. The irony is that I am using another Dlink product as the router. The 520 is a poor product."
1,Is not compatible with many computers,"The following answer on the D-Link tech support site says it all: ""The DWL-520 requires a PCI 2.2 compliant motherboard (3.3v) in order to function. If your PCI slot is 2.1 compliant, or if the PCI slot is using 5v, then the card won't be detected by Windows and unfortunately will not work."" And how will you know if you have a PCI 2.2 compliant board? Essentially, you won't, until you try the card or dig deep into the specs on your computer's motherboard. I have a very reputable ASUS Pentium III motherboard, that won't recognize this card. Very frustrating..."
1,Waste of time and money.,"DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, PURCHASE THIS CARDI bought this NIC at CompUSA for $40 and thought it would make a nice, low cost wireless card. This thing was a nightmare from start to finish. The configuration utility that comes with it is totally counterintuitive. Nothing is where you think it would be. After installation, it detected my wireless network just fine. Steady 80-90% signal strength with NINETY-FIVE PERCENT packet loss. The connection would be stable for two minutes at the most and then die. I tried different PCI slots, I tried different channels, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software... nothing worked. I called D-Link support multiple times and spoke to a totally clueless ""technician"" each time. They offered such pearls as ""try a different router"" and ""try uninstalling your sound card"". Please.There are plenty of other complaints online about this piece of junk. Don't bother buying this card. It's a complete joke."
5,i like it a lot,this is a very nice pencil that won't disapoint you. the lead is impossible to break and it ships rather QUICKLY.
2,Lousy Order Processing,"Ordered the Faber Castell E-Motion pencil & leads from J&R with the 1~2 business days shipping advertisement. After hounding them with calls, the pencil was finally shipped 4 business days later and they have no idea when leads will ship. Don't count on your order shipping when indicated..."
3,So-so,"Ok if you're a big fan. The best part was about Burt Reynolds. Lacking insight, but worthwhile if you're a fan."
4,Great book with some technical glitches.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and its style of switching back and forth from the 96 season to historical background and vignettes of the small time racer. A couple of nits to pick. The summary of the CART-Indy 500 dispute was just plain wrong and should have been caught in the editing process. (The problem was not that Indy Speedway wanted to open up qualifying, just the opposite. He guranteed spots to his IRL drivers even if their speeds were slower. )Second, the first part of the season was covered in meticulous detail, but the last half was summarized. It seemed like the author was looking to wind it up. These points aside, this was a very well written and entertaining book."
1,Just an excuse to advertise to children,"My children receive this magazine as a gift, and every month it gets worse. The advertising inside is overwhelming, and this month it even came wrapped in an advertising spread. The ""articles"" are often just more advertising as well. For example, there was an article about the movie, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" that compared real vikings to how they were portrayed in the movie, but it was so obviously about the movie and not really historical in any way. This magazine is so bad that I can't believe National Geographic actually has anything to do with it. I would not be surprised to find out they had simply leased their name to another publisher."
2,Thin,"My daughter got a year's subscription of National Geographic For Kids as a gift. Good thing, I would have cancelled it had I paid one red cent for it. It is a thin magazine and honestly barely thicker than a leaflet. It has a heavy ad to articles ratio. The content is average, what there is of it. If you are thinking of subscribing, get it cheap. Under 10 would be worth it but at 15 they are ripping you off."
2,National Georgraphic sells out,"My child got this as a gift and it's a real disappointment -- full of ads for video games (including some rated as violent right in the ad) and pseudo-articles about products, such as one on the ""science"" behind this season's coolest new electronic gadgets. The first issue we received has articles that are really marketing pitches on both the third Harry Potter movie and the Lord of the Rings films, and a six-page spread on the 20th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. If you want a good kids' magazine about nature, skip this and get Big Backyard (which our child loves) or Ranger Rick."
1,National Geographic should be embarrassed.,"There are interesting articles in this magazine. However, every fun fact is sandwiched between ads for junk food, movies, or video games. This magazine is one long advertisement. I'm surprised that a magazine/organization like National Geographic would want to be associated with content like this. Instead of this, I'd recommend Ranger Rick, American Girl, or any of the long list of publications from Carus (Appleseeds, Cricket, etc.)."
2,Was hoping my child would read more...,My son is 12 and reads under his grade level. We are looking for things that he is interested in reading so we can bring up his comprehension. The actual readable content of this magazine is very little and is comprised primarily of picture captions. Waste of money and time.
2,Don't waste your money,This kids magazine is not very good and my 5 year old is not very interested in it at all. I am glad I only ordered it for 3 months. Buy something much better like Ladybug or Click. Costs a little more but its worth every penney.It does not have all the advertising mentioned in previous reviews its just a bad magazine.
1,It should be called National Advertising,"National Geographic should be ashamed of themselves. The only thing that any kid perusing this magazine would learn is what toys they do NOT have. Are there any articles related to nature, to different cultures, and to different places? No!!! Please do not waste your money on this magazine. Subscribe to National Geographic for Little Kids which is different from this shameful magazine."
1,"Too much American pop culture and commercialism, not enough of real National Geographic.","My daughter received this magazine for one year as a gift and I was so disappointed with the layout and quality of information. It is bright and fun looking, but every issue had bits of disjointed information in a sea of commercialism. I did find a few articles were interesting and age appropriate, although they were rather shallow. I remember one issue, our second one, that focused on Star Wars...and although I am a sci-fi fan, I hoping my daughter would be learning about animals and other real-life cultures, not about movies! I was disappointed that it focuses so much on the American pop culture.Honestly, there are much better quality magazines for children."
1,Not what I expected,"I am so disappointed in the KIDS magazine. It isn't what I was expecting at all! It is a lot of advertising and the print is so small it is difficult for an adult to read. No chance an 8 yr old can read it on his own! What happened to the classy WORLD magazine for kids? This is a mix of a lot of junky stuff on the pages. Wish I had known the format and the tiny print. I'm so sorry I ordered it for the community center kid's program, ages 6 to 11."
1,Sadly awful,"It is painful to see a publication like National Geographic turn out such a bad magazine for children. It is almost one big ad from cover to cover. There seems to be no real sense of nature or of learning. If you are looking for a great nature magazine for children, look for NWF's Your Big Back Yard for those under 7 or Ranger Rick for the older ones. Both of these are a sources of facts and exciting information about nature for children.Your Big Backyard (1-year auto-renewal)"
1,"All Advertising, No content","My son and daughter love reading about nature, and wildlife etc. so we got this subscription and were so dissapointed. A normal issue was 5% (probably being kind) informational content, 5% useless content (non educational items) and the remaining 90% was advertisements. Would never recommend this to anyone. Save your money."
1,"An advertisement, not a magazine",Full of shoe and video game ads. Not much content. Content is low quality.
1,National Geographic for Kids,After reading all of the reviews I have decided not to buy this for my grandson. I always thought National Geographis was a great magazine but it sounds like it has gone down hill badly with all the ads. I am so glad I read the reviews before buying.
2,Shameless,"Having just received the Jan 2010 issue, I'm appalled. Apparently National Geographic Kids is Mr. Hyde to the adult's magazine's Dr. Jekyll. None of what NG has worked hard to establish with their flagship magazine is here. When trying to imagine this magazine, don't think ""National Geographic Kids"" rather ""Cosmo Kids"" gives you a better sense of its content: Cheap pandering to its audiences urges with barely an attempt to redeem itself. For example, I'd love to see NG Kids promote films about wildlife to my kids, like IMAX's Under the Sea or Wild Oceans. Instead the wildlife film promoted is the Chimpmunk Squeakquel, complete with Alvin and his buddies in a toilet. I've seen Rob Schneider movies with more dignity."
1,"Horrible, full of CRAP","We have been recieving this magazine for the last year(2009) and it is GARBAGE!!! I actually have stopped allowing my kids to look at it, I just THROW IT IN THE TRASH when it arrives. The advertising is ridiculous. Every issue if full of the latest kids movies and garbage food ads. The actual articles are mediocre at best. Steer clear of this magazine."
2,Too many adverts: National Geographic should be embarrassed!,"I'm giving this 2 (versus 1) stars because my daughter likes it (her aunt bought it for her). There are jokes and maybe a few puzzles. And a hidden article or two. But, I cannot overemphasize how many ads this has---and they aren't that distinguishable from the main text, either. We deliberately keep her away from Disney channel and shows with commercials, and yet suddenly at dinner she will start discussing a movie or toy we have not even heard of. Where did she get the info.? National Geographic. She ADORES Ranger Rick, and if there were more like it, we'd sign her right up. Too bad NG can't clean up their act. They should be giving this one away free."
4,always a good read..!,"Thank you Llewellyn,I love your Magical Almanacs,they are always a good reqad..!!"
4,Enjoyable!,"Lots of great stories and information, especially helpful new-comers to the mystical path. It's well worth the coin to have a copy of this on your desk."
2,Not what I expected.,"I should have taken the advise of those that did not provide an adequate rating for this item. Moral of the story, you get what you pay for. Flimsy, cheaply made mold. If all you want to do is store your shotgun/rifle in the closet so the firearm doesnt collect dust, its pefect. Aside from that, forget about using it for anything else. It really sucks!! $35 bucks down the tube, I'm having several regrets buying from Amazon and will reconsider buying something sight unseen ever again. Be smart, spend $100 bucks on a sturdy stainless case and you wont regret it."
4,Good,Good guality for the price. Not going to be using for anything but transporting my rifle from the safe to the range/hunting.
2,You get what you pay for....SORTA,"Kinda flimsy, but what do you expect for $25?One of the snaplocks came off when we were closing it the first time.I have a common Remington 700 and it slides around in the case.It will serve the purpose of storage, but thats about it.I would not travel with it more then from the house to the truck and back and make sure it stays flat or padlocked because it would come open with as flimsy as it is."
1,crummy hinge -- don't trust this case with a gun you care about,"Brand new out of the box, the hinge on this case was sprung. It's a piano hinge and the interlocking pieces were so deformed, there was no possible way for me to get them to lock together properly. I reboxed the case with the intention of mailing it back to Amazon. Missed the 30-day return window. Now I am putting it out on the curb for recycling.That hinge is critical because when you hold the case by the handle, the hinge is below your gun. If it fails, your gun (and scope) will fall onto the ground. As it was delivered, the hinge was broken and there's no way it would have held my rifle.Lesson learned. When you gamble on cheap products like this, MAIL THEM BACK TO AMAZON ASAP. This case is junk. On the plus side, it can be recycled."
1,"Basic case, worth what it costs (barely)","This case is barely okay but has one huge problem -- the handle. The handle is so flimsy, I don't know that I would be able to trust it to carry the case with anything in it."
4,A Good Inexpensive Rifle Case,"If you want absolute protection buy a Browning Travel Vault or the Pelican vaults This is better than the cheapest cases and has a plastic pillar which does provide added protection from side damages. It has four locking latches. One star for the latches being relatively easy to come off the case <They install back on, but the design could be better so this doesn't happen> Foam inside is adequate for what the case is intended for: inexpensive way to safely transport a scoped rifle to the range and back home. I would NOT USE this to transport on an airline. I use the cases when shipping a rifle that has been sold as the best means of ensuring the rifle has a chance of getting there intact, at reasonable cost. <Note: UPS did manage to ram a rifle through a case similar to this, going completely through the end of the case, damaging the front sight on a Ruger rifle. Cannot imagine how far is must have been dropped to do this. It happened?"
3,Feels a little weak,I have a tactical shotgun with a scope and it does not fit with the scope attached. This case is made of thin plastic and we will see how many trips I get out of this case. But for $40 it will be what it is.
4,An Interesting Book on How to Deal with Disabilities,"As one who has CP as Lee did, I can indenify with some of the things he says. Although I disagree with his assertion that disabilities are from God, the book shows a disabled perosn ways in which they can improve thier lives by the way they think. I would recomend this book to parents and friends of people with disabilities to gain better insight and understanding of our world!"
4,"A danagerous, fascinating visit to Purple Sage, Texas","With Skeletons in Purple Sage, Barbara Burnett Smith hascreated a very appealing heroine in Jolie Wyatt, arealistic and interesting family and a whole town ofcharacters, good and bad.A disasterous flood has brought the Governor to townto asses the damage and Jolie has been picked to hosta reception - difficult to do when the site is undersix feet of water.The next available location is logical but difficult,since the hostess is the new wife of Jolie's good friend'sEx. After that, the discovery of the body of the town'sbeloved doctor in a ditch just piles on the trouble.Jolie wants to find out who took her doctor's life, whythe local fundamentalist church is shunning the doctor'sfuneral and why her Mother always liked her sister best.I strongly recomment this book for its character developmentand the exciting plot."
5,i need you,"the sleepy jackson are a band that hails from australia encompassing different styles of a lil bit of jazz, alot of folk, tasty twang, pure rock, catchy pop and even some new wave-esque sounds. however, the music doesnt allow itself to just fall into any ordinary genre, the simply good boy-girl melodies and lyrics bring the listener to another magical place all together. straight from the haunted dream world of band leader luke steeles, the 2003 album lovers is an original piece of work which may seem a lil out of left field for some but for those who enjoy taking an open-minded risk, will immediately win over. ++"
3,A One Band Sampler,"I recognize that The Sleepy Jackson throws up a lot of different styles, does them all pretty well, but the fact is pretty well just doesn't do it for me. And the underutilized female backups are just plain boring after awhile with their Motown meets the Four Seasons style, which is the one constant in most of the cuts here. A little more intensity and focus would be a welcome addition to their talents. Downloads: This Day, Acid in My Heart, Come to This and Miniskirt."
2,Great songs; Not-so-good audio quality,"I bought this CD for the song ""Tender Years"", which has been one of those songs I've had a distant admiration for since I saw this movie back in the 80s. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the audio quality of this cd isn't the best. It sounds like it's been recorded live with some guy with a microphone (without the live crowd noise)."
2,"What happened to ""Season In Hell""?","I wonder how many different versions of this soundtrack are out there. This current version, released by Volcano (as of 06/02) only includes the last 2 minutes of ""Season In Hell"", and not the full 6+ minutes listed on the cover. I'm very disappointed."
3,Mismatched?,Sound quality ok but overall pedigree in question.Jacket track list does not match play order.Is this the genuine article? Or a pirate copy?
2,Hate it,"I hade this printer for 4 years now. The first time my parents got it was working good for 3 Months. Then the paper started to get jammed and both color, black, and white ink cost my parents almost $50.00. This is the worst printer I have ever had Im thinking of getting a laser printer now or something other printer that will last longer."
1,This is NOT P funk!!,I had to send this CD back twice. You can see from the track listing that this Is Not Gegrge Clinton.
3,Chesapeake Bay Retriever: Acomplete and reliable handbook RX,An informitive book about the breed A good book to read before you get this breed of dog
1,Patchy The Pirate Warning,"Do not watch Pest of the West if you do not like Patchy the Pirate. This is one of the many SpongeBob specials that involve Patchy the Pirate. I do not like Patchy the Pirate, but i like Plankton and Mr. Krabs.Mikaela ArsenaultSalem,NH"
4,Good product,"It worked as expected, but I had to transfer the Red Line Manual Transmission oil from its original container because the pump did not fit the bottle. It works fine in a standard one quoter oil bottle."
2,Warning...,"Unless you are really into modern art, Picasso, and Guernica (the painting) you'll probably find this book a bit boring. Not that it isn't well written and researched, it is, but for the average reader something more was needed. I was looking for more insights into Picasso the man and a deeper look into those troubled times. About the only feeling in this book is a kind of leftist-elitist-snobbery. I'm about halfway through the book now and may finish it...."
5,Excellent,"Although this is an older book, it arrived in perfect condition. Although I have struggled with the concepts in the book it is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you."
4,Good as New,"Kids 'N' Pets stain and odor remover is a great product. I used it to clean fabric toddler chairs. It has taken out stains from ketchup to urine. It smells great, and is safe to use for myself and my kids. The chairs look as good as new after using this product."
1,Who rated this?,This stuff does not work. I bought it based on the Amazon.com review. I tried it on pee and vomit from my dog. It did not get out the yellow of the vomit nor did it get out the pee smell. Total waste of money. Water worked better.
2,Don't get me wrong,"I'm a big John Cafferty fan. I saw them live back in 1984 at the height of their ""fame"" and was bowled over. It was easily one of the best concerts that I've ever attended. That said, this album really leaves me cold, as did the entire Eddie II saga. A lukewarm movie and a stillborn soundtrack. How many times have you seen this recipe? It's tough to live through one lightning strike. Why tempt another?"
4,"Eddie and the Cruisers II, Eddie Lives","Not a bad movie, but it didn't have the suspense of the first movie. We enjoyed it a lot. John Cafferty can still ROCK!!!!"
3,A Terminal Road Awaits,"Guy Pearce was great in Momento - but that was a Christopher Nolan film. First Snow reminds me a bit of Momento mixed with Insomnia but with markedly less dramatic results. Somehow, somewhere, I didn't quite connect with this 100 %.The dust jacket of the DVD tells us why this is a compelling premise - Guy Pearce plays Jimmy, a man who's trying to fight against his own fate. And with no surprises, this is exactly what plays out with few surprises. Or rather, the twists aren't quite twisted enough, leaving the audience with an average noir-psychological drama aftertaste. First Snow almost but doesn't quite hit the mark.This is not the easiest of genres to satisfy demanding viewers. The film won't quite give you the chills or make your head scratch - it's watchable but it won't have you on the edge of your seats."
2,Mediocre at best,I found this mildly humorous at times but mostly boring. I would say it's a much less funny clerks set in San Francisco. The characters aren't very interesting nor is the dialogue.
4,Great puzzle,Great puzzle for my 8 yr old on his birthday. He was able to do it on his own in 30 min. He loves jungle animals so this was a perfect gift. Nice large pieces.
1,not usable,"When attached the seat is suspended a half inch above the bowl by its hinges. Poor quality fake wood with imperfections in the surface I could live with, but this does not even provide the basic requirements for a seat."
3,Good medical dictionary,"This medical dictionary is a hard cover book and it is very heavy. However, it is a great book for the medical terminiology course I purchased it for. Because of the size and heaviness, it is a little difficult to look through the book in a hurry, however, if you have time to look through the dictionary for research, this is the book for you!"
2,Book is the size of my house - spell checker is AWESOME but worthless,"I am currently in a nursing student at a local university. This book was part of our forcibly-enforced book package. I've found that the best resource is Taber's Cyclopedic Encyclopedia for the PDA.Dorland's spell checker makes this package almost worth it, provided it didn't CRASH MS Word 2003 incessantly.I really feel cheated."
3,"Lightweight, your mileage might vary....","I bought this and its companion book, Forgotten Algebra, in the hopes of shoring up math skills for engineering and physics classes. This is not a useful book for such. It gets about as far as the chain rule and some simple multivariable stuff, with an emphasis on biz apps. My mistake, the book is likely fine for most readers just wanting a quick refresh of the very bssics."
2,Average,"Hello Amazon community, I got this modem included in my cable deal, it performs ok, but I have not been able to make it work on Windows 98 SE with the USB port, which I somehow believe would work faster then the Ethernet port.I have tried everything at least twice, and still no USB."
1,surprised by failure,"I had this modem for over 2 years and had only minor problems such as the need to reboot at least once a week to clear out errors from the buffer. Everything was working fine until last week when it suddenly stopped working. At first I thought it was service interruption so I spent several hours on the phone with my ISP only to figure out that my modem is a problem. The modem acted as if it could not get the signal. After reading some of the horror stories, here at Amazon, related to D-Link's customer service I decided just to throw it away and buy new Motorola Surfboard. Although I don't notice any speed difference with the surfboard, it takes much less time to boot up. Whereas with DCM 200 it took approx. 40 seconds to boot, with my new Motorola it takes no more than 10 seconds. I always thought that D-Link makes good, high quality products but this incident changed my mind. I won't buy another D-link."
4,Stunning look at human body,"This book is very harsh, unpleasant, but impressive. Not at all for anybody because you need to have the guts to keep your glance at the pictures mirroring the abnormal, the illnesses, the horror of nature, the facts of the old times of surgery. As Bacon's paintings these pictures have a very sui-generis aesthetics, based upon the ugly and the deformity."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I've heard the raves but I was just not impressed. It was radically different in tone and style than The OC by Ware. The non-Orthodox quotes get annoying fast and almost silly to the extent in which they are used. Also why did he feel he quote the Gospel of Thomas (I think that's what it was) and the Gospel of Truth (gnostic?). Odd.I think a drawback for a conservative evangelical reading this book was the lack of scriptural support for the 'way' demonstrated. The book seemed to be more geared to 'liberals'.The biggest problem with the book is that I found it not to be sincere. I don't know exactly what I mean by that, but I just feel like he was holding back. I dunno."
4,One problem...,"A truly great book! One problem, however, is the emphasis sometimes placed on Origen. While most of Origen's work is considered ""Orthodox,"" he was later declared a hereitic for some of his later teaches. Do not let this distract from the book, but this is worth noting."
5,Simply the best cookbook I own,"I must have about 60 cookbooks on the shelves in my kitchen. This is the one & only book that stays out on my countertop. It is the one & only book that I can go to for any occasion, any meal, and season and find a recipe that the most picky eaters will thoroughly enjoy. My pickiest eater (husband) calls this ""the good cookbook"" and questions a new meal I serve as to whether it was derived from Outdoor Living. Every recipe I've followed from this book has tasted fabulous. I can't say enough good things about Outdoor Living. If you're looking for a cookbook and don't already own Outdoor Living, this is the book you want. I have about 10 different williams sonoma cookbooks and none of the others are as good as Outdoor Living. Not only are the recipes fantastic, the variety and fabulous seasonal organization are perfect. It ensures you are cooking with the correct (freshest) ingredients and you mix up your meals every three months."
4,Interesting Mystery,"When Jacobia ""Jake"" Tiptree plans a visit to Faye Anne Carmody's house, she doesn't expect to find it covered in blood. She also doesn't expect to find Faye Anne dazed, yet alive. But she is. All looks fine, until Jake takes a trip to the butcher's shop, and finds a bunch of meat packages wrapped in brown paper in the display case. Realizing that this is unusual, Jake investigates, only to find Faye Anne's husband's, Merle, body wrapped in those little packages. Then another person is found murdered, and Jake immediately decides that it's up to her to solve the crime, instead of spending time with her family and working on rehabilitating her home. Who can get anything done during the holidays, when there's a killer on the loose?This was the first book I have ever read from ""A Home Repair Is Homicide"" mystery series, and I found it to be very enjoyable. I hope to read more by this author in the near future."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book when I was preparing my dissertation in American Literature and I must say the compilation really disappointed me. Some essays are good, but some are really irrelevant if you're looking for a general overview of American Literature. I think I actually fell asleep reading some. I could have very easily done without this book."
5,Safety for Digital Memory Cards,"There are other products out there to store ones valuable memory cards, but I find this one to be superior to all others. It seals tight and the cards will not drop out when case is opened. It will truly safely secure these valuable items. I would hate to lose a memory card, because a failed to take proper precautions. This one will let you rest at ease."
4,The cowboy not depicted in westerns!,"This book turned out to be far more interesting than I anticipated it would be. Rarely do you get the feelings of comraradie found among ranch hands, or envision them doing the day to day tasks such as washing or mending clothes from films about the old west. I have also read several books by Larry McMurtry and Louis D'Amour in years past and have not felt the emotions of the cowboy come through as strongly as in this book. In one episode one of the men lost a friend whom he had known throughout his school days, killed by rustlers. The sadness and anger felt by this loss of friendship and senseless death colored the rest of the novel.You are sure to enjoy this work especially if you have an interest in the Old West!"
5,Great stuff!,"If you like jazz guitar with a little latin flare, than this is for you! Better than his previous effort."
2,This One Still Mostly a Dummie (For Me Anyway!),"I read all the rave reviews for this book so thought it would be a great choice since my actual ""Robert's Rules"" is worn out and confusing at times to say the least. I don't find the short explanations enough for most of my questions. Should have just bought another updated version of the real thing. I guess it would be OK if your voice didn't mean anything in whatever organization you're involved in."
5,Robert's Rules for Dummies,This book was a very good purchase! I need to review Robert's Rules on occasion and this book makes them very understandable. Great purchase price as well.
2,Hemry Got Better With Age,"Read Lost Fleet first and liked it so much that I went back to read some other Hemry books. Unfortunately, it looks like it took him a bit to get the hang of things. Shallow characters, and the plot seemed like one cliche after another (and I'm in the military myself). Not quite up the the standards of modern military sci-fi."
2,Disappointing at best,"Compared to his Lost Fleet series, I found this book poorly written and boring. The characters are simplistically drawn, lack depth, and are as predictable as your 70-year old retired neighbors. The only thing that got me to the easily-guessed ending was the fact that I'd paid $9 for it. His other books are WAY better."
4,"@ commentor john barry, see book by bryan sykes or oppenheimers on origin of the english, scottish, welsh and irish people","...they are all of same stock . . . welsh, scottish, irish *and* english. english only slighly varied from rest of the isles with single digit legacies from the germanic tribes, i think 6% germanic, and 2% from roman occupation."
2,Blow away Garden Flag for Iowa,"Bought and sent an (Iowa Hawkeye) garden flag w/pole to my granddaughter in Amana, IA. Unfortunately, the winds in the area where she resides are to strong and it blew away twice. After finding it a second time in the mud of an adjacent field, she decided to nail the flag to a post on her back porch. Anyone need a garden flag pole?"
5,This is well done!,"It truly is WORD for WORD authoratative, very enriching, PRAISE GOD! Over four hours of footage of Israel, with the Book of Luke re-enacted with the WORD."
4,well-told story by a maturing writer,"Like the author's first book, Prospero's Children, this book begins in rural England, where elements of magic and strange happenings are gradually introduced into an otherwise modern setting. Also like the first book, the main character spends a significant part of the story isolated in a different ""world."" In this book, however, the author does a much better job of carrying two story lines, and integrating the other world into the main story. The character development and sense of realism are also much improved. I found this book to be a entertaining read, with some interesting ideas and story elements, all very well told. I recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Jan Siegel's work."
4,Size,"The product is very comfortable but it can be more useful if it was bigger, I am using it in a restaurant."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this a little while ago, and was somewhat disappointed. Phil Coulter's renditions of these songs are a bit to jazzy for my taste, and there is only one song with bagpipes! But don't get me wrong, I do still enjoy listening to it. It is just not one of my favorites. Not recommended for someone looking for authentic Scottish music."
1,Worst Gam Ever,I played this game for hours and after doing exactly as I was instructed it said mission failed. How could I have failed the mission when I did it just as I was instructed it is very difficult to control the character. Changing between weapons was difficult. An it came with no box or no instruction manual which was not written in the description of the item I was very disappointed with this purchase all together.
1,Just too darn hard,"I loved Killzone on the PS2 and was excited to get a Killzone game for the PSP. Sadly, I find the difficulty level in this game to be too high. I have to replay some levels five or six times to get through. I do not find that kind of difficulty to be enjoyable. I find it frustrating and irritating.If you're good at third person shooters maybe you'll breeze through this one. For myself, I think I'm going to put this game down and stick with first person shooters."
4,brooklyn rose,"I found out Ann Rinaldi had a new book out , and i was very excited. but i wasn't fully satisfied with this novel. it def. wasn't one of her best works. it showed very well how love grew between rene & rose , but neither character fully developed,and it was to short it left me unsatisfied i would have enjoyed reading on. yet i would recommend this book to someone looking for a short good read, this book is def. for girls though."
1,Here we go again...,"Perhaps someday someone will correct Dr. Kelley's understanding of Objectivism and help him eliminate the title of Grand Second Hander. He so changes the underlying tenants of Objectivism (as he expresses in this mediocre book), that he should call his work something other than ""Objetivism"". Why must he call his work the same thing as someone else's work? I am thankful that I borrowed this book from a library instead of buying it as I would consider it to have been a complete waste of my money. Better to leave Ayn Rand's work to Ayn Rand's books and ignore second-handers."
5,The best show ever on TV,"I have many fond memories of this show and when I saw it as low as $139.99 I decided to treat myself. The complete set assembly is great. The discs come in two sections with the coffee table book. The amount of additional info in the book and the ""notes about nothing"" on each episode is fun to read while watching. You really get to see how this show picked up steam from the very beginning with no following to a show with a huge cult following. This probably would be the only TV show series that I would ever want to own."
2,"Re-Packaged, Was bought new but not new. Cases Broken","The DVD's themselves were in perfect condition, which is the most important. But, the cases themselves were broken on the seams and unglued from the packaging causing the DVD holder to fall upon opening the package. Also, the book that came with the set had some broken binding.If the gift was bought for me I would be happy that the DVD's were in good shape but, it was an anniversary give for my girlfriend and she was not pleased with the damaged goods. She is a huge fan of Seinfeld and was let down by the packaging."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this purchase because the condition of the product i purchased (Seinfeld series boxset) was in far lesser condition then was described which was "" very good"" in the product's statement. It was scratched, faded slightly and 1 part at the bottom of the exterior container had collapsed in a bit which makes it far from ""Very Good"" condition to me. If i knew it was in this state i would never have brought it and waited for a better copy.Other then that I love the series boxset and love seinfeld and the content within. Seinfeld is the best sitcom ever made"
5,great at any price,Just before Christmas Amazon offered this at a very reduced price! This is a great purchase anyway. One gets all the seasons. the DVds contain lots of extras such as cast commentaries. It is an excellent value at any price.
2,"Great show, confusing packaging, enfuriating watching","Ok we all know Seinfeld is a great show, however this box set is a nightmare to own and to watch.Firstly all of the DVDs look pretty much identical to each other. Unlike Fasier or many others that gave each series it's own color scheme etc....every Seinfeld DVD looks identical in that they all have a pic of George, Krammer , Jerry or Elianne on them...at first glance flicking through them, you'd have no hope of identifying them.But worst of all is the insane copyright warning that you have to read in every language before the shows.I love the show, but dread trying to find my favorite episode in amongst this lot."
5,Excellent,"Great item, i really liked all the bonus material that comes on the DVD's. The book that is included is funny and informative. Overall, a really worthwhile purchase for any Seinfeld fan!"
3,Good Quality DVDs and poor quality packaging.,The DVDs were of fine quality but the packaging was damaged. I wish I could get a replacement.
5,"This stinks, literally...","Although I'd been a huge fan of Seinfeld, I didn't start buying dvds right away because I knew they were going to release the box set with some really cool bonus materials. I know how they do the business or I should say, rip us off. So I waited for years, watching the episodes I taped off of tv. My waiting finally ended.This box set as I expected got it all!!, more than I expected actually. All episodes, tons of extras, interviews, bloopers, previously unseen footage, easter eggs, the coffee table book and even the reunion show!!!Everything is neatly, meticulously, fastidiously packed as if Jerry Seinfeld himself did the job. I don't know any other dvd or box set that's as great as this one.One problem. The whole box really really stinks for some reason. I don't know exactly what it is but I can't do anything about it like...BO!!"
2,Very dark and hard to watch.,This movie went around in circles and was very dark and hard to watch. As a matter of fact I never finished it. If you like creepy uncomfortable dark movies you will love this.
2,Didn't like it,I was surprised by the ending but the movie itself was so slow moving and hard to stay interested. I've seen way better.
2,Uhh...,Super weird. Kind of gross. I just felt kind of bored with this movie even though the actors were good. It was just weird.
2,Dumb movie,"This movie was very dull. It was one of those movies you only keep watching because you have too much time invested to not see the end. I don't understand why so many people like this movie. It reminded me of an artsy indie movie, that only movie snobs like."
4,Giving Machinists a bad rap,"Christian Bale plays the part of an operator, not a machinist.Just thought I'd clear that up for anyone who has seen or will seethis movie. I enjoyed the movie. I feel so tired...."
5,You must see this!,"I can't really think of anything catchy that will make you want to see this. All I can say is that you simply must see this!!!Christian Bale gives, what I consider to be, his best performance ever. This movie is for movie buffs all the way. Watching this at points feels like a game of clue. You're trying to put all the pieces together to make sense of whats going on. You'll watch this more than once, and find metaphors and symbology and clues that you didn't notice before... AND THEY ARE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT! You will enjoy and appreciate that. The story itself is very well written, and almost flawless. The special features are pretty nice and informative, so even if you've never seen it, you're in for a treat. If you haven't seen this at all yet (like me), GET IT!P.S, my only gripe is the menus. Its very hard to tell which one is highlighted."
5,"I'd Buy Trevor A Flea Collar, Too","I have long admired Christian Bale as an actor ever since I saw him in Empire of The Sun. I think this movie is by far the pinnacle of his career. This is a thinking person's psychological thriller. When I realized it was directed by Brad Anderson, I just knew I wouldn't be disappointed. (His Session 9 is another masterpiece.) There are so many symbols and allusions in the film that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. In fact, I had to watch the film a couple of times. I wasn't surprised to see it was filmed in Spain. Somehow films made with European collaborators have more texture and meat on their bones (even if poor Trevor didn't have any on his). Anyone who was disappointed in it, just didn't get it. Christian Bale rules as far as I'm concerned!! The extra scenes in the DVD were nice to have if only because they just added a little more detail."
5,Super resource!,"Anyone diagnosed with AMD needs to read this book--it is full of great information to help ease your mind. Also, the author includes updates on the latest medical studies."
4,When Rocky meets Rudy...,"UnderdogRockyovercomes tremendous odds to become a champion prizefighter. UnderdogRudyfights through the odds to become a member of the Fighting Irish. And in Invincible, Vince Papale, a 30 year old bartender who has never played collegiate football, makes the Philadelphia Eagles football team.And unlike Rocky Balboa,Rudy RuettigerandVince Papaleare real people!Invincible obviously is a romanticized version of Papale's life (played by (Mark Wahlberg). In realty, Papale played for the World Football League before it folded, so had professional football experience. But the movie uses the tension of Papale's personal life, the irritation of his teammates, the pressure on the coaching staff, and the rigors of the practice field to develop the story.And it is an entertaining story!"
4,Great flick,"I am not a Eagle fan, but this story is still inspirational to anybody. It has almost a similar feel to Rudy, also a fav of mine."
2,Watching Grass Grow Is More Exciting,"Very dissapointed, it was slow, boring and uneventful. It shows you how despaerate the Eagles were. The only thing greatly depicted was how the Philly fans are. Rude, obnoxious and poor losers!!!!!!!Not in the class of Rudy and the Rookie as inspiartional stories."
5,Wahlberg gives a great performance in this movie,"Very endearing movie that is about a man who is kind of ""off the street"" who makes the Eagles team in open tryouts. He goes from becoming a 30 year old bartender to Professional football player and it is a true story that has a lot of heart and emotion to it. Kinnear is also in the movie he plays coach Dick Vermeil. The movie is a great film for the family and is a story about triumph and chance and love of the game so to speak. It does not matter if you like football or the Eagles team it matters that you understand the message. Sometimes a movie like this fails but I think this one is a keeper and shows how dreams do come true even if they seem totally impossible. Mark is great as Vince and it shows the opportunity that is presented to him that he ultimately turns into a dream come true."
4,Excellent inpirational story about a regular joe who does right,"This was a great movie with a historical tie that can serve as an inspiratin to all regular working joes like me. Vince Paple (mark wahlburg) is a barkeep down on his luck, just abandoned by his wife, and scraping by on money who gets a break for open try outs with The Philidelphia Eagles, his home town team. Dick Vermil (Greg Kinnear) is a new coach just up from UCLA to the pros who has the task to try and right the sinking ship, and has to find a cornerstone to build his team on. Made by the same folks who did ""The Rookie"", this story shows a man who learns to believe in himself, and to take on show great character not only for his family but the kids and people of South Philidelphia. Rent this movie, buy this movie, either way, worth a viewing, and a light brush up on NFL history."
4,A Sports Film That Takes a Different Angle,"Life is tough and some people have dreams that keep them going. For Vince Papale and friends, those dreams were wrapped up in the football team that they so faithfully followed and rooted for--the Philadelphia Eagles. In this movie, we learn that something as simple as one touchdown in a seemingly insignificant game can lift a man's spirits like nothing else. We also learn that one man's struggle and achievement, though they seem trivial to those on the top, can mean the world to those who look up to that man. This film may be about a raw talent that beat impossible odds to play football alongside the world's best, but more so, it is about a city and what one man's triumph did to lift that city."
4,Great family fare,"This is a wonderful film that the entire family can enjoy (without watching a cartoon). It has the further benefit of being based on a real person's life and experience. In some ways it is Dick Vermeil's story as well as Vince Papale's. Both are embarking on long-shot careers. The fact that we know how Vermeil's will turn out provides reassurance that Vince's will turn out well also. A sweet and engaging film about individual aspiration, family, neighborhood, and friendship. Watch it with your kids without any fear of embarrassment. How often can you say that today?"
4,Hope and dreams,"A good feel good movie about a man overcoming his circumstances (many out of his control). A well tempered performance by Mark Wahlberg, who continues to show growth as an actor. The story is not just about him but also about his coach (an excellent portrayal by Greg Kinnear) as they both carry the hopes of many on their performances in the story! Good true story movie with period music, clothes and cars that can be watched by the whole family."
3,Mark Walberg's been better,I liked this movie but not completely what I was expecting. It was based on a true story which also made it appealing but I found the story kind of dragged on. The football scenes were amazing though. Really got into the action and let you feel the violence that is professional football.
1,Outdate,"This book was a waste of money. It was written in 2003. This is a topic that requires up to date information. TO THE WRITTER, Either update the info or stop sell this book. the only thing i can use it for is a door stopper. Wish i read the reviews before wasting my money including shipping. what a mistake."
5,Laughs AND New Ideas,"Rarely have I found a business book that makes me laugh, have ""ah-ha!"" moments AND give me refreshing new ideas for how to work with my clients. A great book for consultants or business leaders."
2,Not useful to me,"The book is definitely of little use to me.I have a severe case of Candida, everytime I eat carbohydrates of any kind. i.e. Potatoes, whole wheat, oats, my Candida flares up.The book is completely FULL OF WHEAT AND CARBOHYDRATE recipes. You will be surprissed!"
5,The best candida diet I have ever tried...,"This book is amazing. I have suffered from candida overload for 20 years (I had tried diet and alternative medicine many times) and it had developed into chronic fatigue - I was struggling to get to work each day. After reading her book, I hired a nutritionist from Ms. White's business (we converse via e-mail - ... and took the supplements recommended and carefully followed her four point plan and diet. I am, at only one month, feeling great - out of bed and on the move! All my pains are gone, my sinuses and acne are clearing up, I have lost 20 pounds, even my fungal toenails are clearing up. I still have to stay on the diet a year at least, but it is very much worth it. None of the other methods have worked as well as this. This thorough and complete program really works and I can't recommend this book and her program enough."
4,They hit the nail right on the head!!,"The comment ""it doesn't matter how much money you earn or the number of degrees after your name that counts, it is what you contribute to others and society that counts"" My wife and I raised our two children with this philosophy and it worked!!!They both are financially successful and have earned multiple degrees but are raising their children with the same philosophy. Furthermore, they married individuals that were raised with this philosophy. Read the book, it's worth every penny."
4,Night Work,"From $upermodels to the $uper rich... So many women, so little time. What's a brotha to do! Imagine being at the top of your game and in high demand. You think that being paid for $exual pleasure is easy, a life of luxury, don't believe anything you've been told until you hear about Night's work. Over the top! Kaisha Moss, JMRC Reviewer"
5,cool,this is a really cool game.the gameplay is not as good as the smackdown vs raw series but the controls are easier to learn. the plot is really good. and the graphics are a little bit above average.also the music is bangin.
4,Ps2,I just got A ps2 and its the best so far. but I like all of the systems exsept the cube. the ps2 plays both dvds ps1 games and ps2 games. no matter what people say about it I will always likeit the best xbox just can not be is good is the ps2.
4,A lil lifesaver,"hey guyz. A memory card, first off, is a MUST. Before I got one i was like on the 15th level or so and couldnt save it so I had to start all over! I always buy a sony and not any other. Once I got a lexar and it didnt work. the only bad thing about this is that it needs more blocks. But other than that it is great."
2,sony 8mb memory card,this original card (8mb) isn't working as should for ps2. memory card (ps1) cannot save on (ps2) cd 1 of 4 then it worked starting cd2 and sometimes it cannot detect and errase all savings? very scary.... wondering what's up with cd3 & cd4 when I get to it. but in the meantime just building up the characters. definitely never buy new sony models of all technologies... they tend to make their equipment recognize only their own brand to work....
1,memory card not functional,The PS1 Memory Card purchased did not work on our PS2. We tried another PS1 Memory Card and that one worked. So signs point to broken Memory Card.
1,FAKE and DOESN'T WORK!,"The item turned out to be a fake and it didn't even work!They overcharge the shipping price by almost 4 dollars!!! (there was a stamp to prove it too)Be warned, don't buy this from here"
2,Adorable but didn't fit me well.,"I love the look of this sandal and soooo wanted it to work out, but they seem to run a bit on the thin side and I don't have a wide foot. If you have really thin feet, these would be great for you! These sandals really are very, very pretty! I was disappointed to have to return them."
1,Not The Way To Learn,"The way this tape goes from one lyric in Japanese to English and back is confusing, bores my 2 yr old and the same melody is used over and over. I agree with the other reviews: it's better for Japanese kids learning English because everything is set in America. Not fair but that's how every ""Japanese"" video I've viewed so far is. Where's the true video that includes teaching the characters/kanji?"
3,"small and light, but limited in some ways","Pros: small size, light weight: I can take it along on backpacking trips where a bigger and heavier tripod would be out of the question.Cons: I would have preferred independent tilt and pan controls for the head (which would have made it easier for panning or shooting panoramas, for example). Also, as another reviewer pointed out, clasp-type locks on the legs would have made the legs lock more securely."
3,World Of Hammer: Mummies Werewolves And the Living Dead,"TO: Hammer Film FansGood:There are:-cool clips from many films-trailers-informationBad:The tape is too short. It only talks about those films listed on the back. What is the ""and more"". Oliver reeeds narrating is quiet.FROM: The Hammer Reveiwer"
1,Animal House this in not!,"What an unbelievably crappy John Hughes movie. There I said it. The storyline is boring, the high school looks like a set from a '30's Dracula movie and the actors should have been paid more for having to put up with such an unbelieveably stupid script. This goes to show all of us that just because a movie has the National Lampoon production credit doesn't mean a thing. Trading on Animal House's popularity, this movie does a great discredit to anything related to NatLamp. Gerrit Graham was great in Used Cars............in this fiasco he just sucked.If you say you got some laughs from this movie you're either eight years old or have some issues with what is paraded about as ""comedy"". Save your money, save your time........or better off, buy an old issue of Nation Lampoon Magazine and get some real laughs."
2,Not what I expected,"Well, somehow I had gotten the idea that this was a documentary about the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Nope. It was a cheesy B-movie about a soldier who meets up with beautiful journalist and they go off and get into trouble together.As B-movies go, I supposed this was average. But when all is said and done, I don't think this movie would even qualify for a spot on Mystery Science Theater 3000."
1,This Phone Sucks!,When I rerceived this phone it worked for about 1 week then the front screen went blank and now we can't use it at all so I wasted $75.00
2,"Worse than original Lemmings, considerably worse than Lemmings 2","I played the original Lemmings game when it came out a long time ago (15 years?). I enjoyed it quite a bit and so when Lemmings 2 came out I bought that game as well. It was a huge improvement over the original with tons of different styles of Lemmings to use. This Lemmings revolution game is a big step backward. There are only a few types of Lemmings to use and the interface seems fairly clunky. It is not intuitive how to scroll around the giant cylinder trying to watch the Lemmings doing their endless march. If you have never played Lemmings then you might enjoy this game, but if you have then go back and play your old version instead of buying this one."
2,doesn't work well,"Even though the case says Windows98/XP, the manual says Windows 95/98. this game keeps stopping on my XP computer. I really thought it would use more advanced technology - it's so antiquated. And I agree, the circular format gets old after awhile. I really liked Lemmings 3-D with all of the different backdrop scenes to work with, but it won't play on this computer. We need a new Lemmings that works well on XP and is lots of fun! This is certainly better than no Lemmings at all, though."
2,only OK,"Not really what I expected, and there isn't any real help or introduction; you just get thrown into the game."
5,"As great as this is, there's better","What I mean by better, one could purchase the Complete Gerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster, I did. All of the other reviewers nailed it, this is good as it gets. I was playing this in Great Basin National Park, and I turned it down fearing I might be disturbing someone. I was camping in a small tent, and was needing entertainment. As anyone who heard this album would agree, it's perfect for the occasion. Well the next morning I was waiting in line to use the restroom, when someone said, ""Hey, that music you were playing last night"" I thought, oh no, here it comes, and the man said, ""You turned it down, I was enjoying it."" With that said, he joined me later in our campsite and listened to the whole album. I'm sure he bought it. Great stuff."
4,1930's Tenor Star + 1950's Baritone Icon,"All the cuts here are satisfying, a couple are quite infectious. But I enjoy Gerry Mulligan's work more when he was not having to play second fiddle or host to another jazz star. The ""Konitz Meets Mulligan"" album had the same limitations, for me. One pairing that is totally enjoyable in this vein however is the Mulligan & Paul Desmond sessions.Ben Webster was good on this album, but far from his best. I urge you to not make this your only exposure to these great sax men."
4,Great Cuban,I'm very pleased with Cantinero de Cuba. It has a great variety of Cuban music that makes you want to dance!!
3,Interesting Journay,This book was a fun look at life and love and the perfect timing. Life is all about choices and this book illustrates this perfectly.
4,Golf Diplay case,Nice product. Does have a flaw in the wood but it's not very noticable. Would order another once this one is full.
3,scarf,This scarf didn't exactly look how I thought it would; I figured it would be a flat cotton scarf but it's kinda dingy and extremely itchy. On the flip-side it's pretty warm and you can tell it's the Slytherin colors.
5,Saints and Sinners,Charles Mingus / The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady: Wonderful album from a musical master. There are a few Mingus albums that every music lover ought to own and this is one of the best of them. Five Stars
5,Hedges,Started reading and not finished yet but Really Good. Keep up the great workThanks Jerry Jenkins. A Friend from Pa
2,20Q Sports,I bought this for my husband's birthday - he is a sports trivia nut. Not such a good choice! Even with specific questions and answers - it rarely guesses correctly. The Sports version is now collecting dust on the coffee table.
2,"GOOD, BUT NOT HIS BEST!!","I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AFTER reading 4 other cussler novels. I wasn't disappointed, but this this book just doesn't grip you like the others. It is less involved and the ending was quick. A good read for a train or plane, it is short and goes quickly."
1,"Two up, two down, about forty more to go","My problem is that I'm a completist. This means that when I consider something worth getting into, I do it from the start, and I acquire everything related to it. In the case of fiction, I begin by reading an author's work chronologically. When I decided to get into Cussler, judging from generally good reviews and my fondness for thrillers, I started with his first book ""Pacific Vortex!"" and have just finished this one, ""The Mediterranean Caper"". I have come to realize rather quickly that Cussler could not have built his reputation with these early works, because they are quite dreadful. I'm hoping things get a lot better as I read through his subsequent efforts.This book is as bad as the one- and two-star reviews have made it out to be. But I read it with the same curiosity that one would watch a cheesy 'B' movie, and basically to witness the evolution of a great writer across the years. Onward then, to ""Iceberg"" and hopefully the writing improves steadily!"
4,a good fast read,Good read. Lots of twists and turns in this book. Ending was a little drawn out but Pitt still got the girl
2,Ragged aound the edges,"I am a huge Clive Cussler fan, Having read most if not all of his books, Never in the proper order, I didnt like this book due to the ragged storyline and the way Dirk Pitt was betrayed, Well, Pretty much as a jerk to women and every time a scene was described it seemed to carry on for to long to the point where I was skipping pages to get past it, Maybe it was just me, But my 2 cents worth is was a waste of the purchase price."
2,Not good; not Cussler at his best.,"If this had been the first Cussler book I had read I would never have read another. Dirk Pitt was a jerk. I didn't like the ""hero"" at all; never did. I don't recommend this to anyone unless they are dye-hard fans of Cussler (and I am)."
3,Standard Clive Cussler,"One of the more misogynistic Dirk Pitt novels, and hence feels quite dated.Usually I just roll with his standard take on women in this author's novels, but this one seemed more extremely unbalanced in how he expressed the lead female character, to the point that it was distracting and felt out of tone. I have read many of Mr.Cussler's books, and will continue to, but feel this is just an area that modern female readers need to just ignore - women are viewed as chattel or worse, and this book errs on the side of outright disgust. I need to read more of the novels with the Fargos to appreciate a more balanced and nuanced approach."
2,mobile edge large laptop bag,"The bag design is great. Holds my 17 in laptop great. Well designed, and sturdy. However the bag was a reject or second, and had a small tear on the bottom. Be sure to inspect carefully."
1,Not quite as advertised,"The pictures are very deceiving, when it arrived it was nothing like the picture. It was very stiff and square looking. It also looked and felt very plastic. It was very disappointing and the disappointment was magnified even more by the amount of time it took to receive the bag. I was not very impressed with Beach Camera and there customer service was very disappointing when I called to ask about the return. I encountered a somewhat surly representative that basically demanded a reason for my return with a snotty attitude. I will not order from them again."
3,This Is Only A Test,"Hello to all of you wondering about this CD. Boy George is really doing a lot of testing. I wish that he could get some really good producers for a change. I am a BIG FAN and I just feel that he isn't putting forth his best efforts in his work these days. This CD does however have a wonderful remix of ""See Thru"" which was taken from the last Culture Club album. I think that most of the other songs on this CD are just repititious. Good beats but gets old fast. I do recommend all Boy George fans to purchase this CD but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
5,Captivating,From the time I started this book I had to keep reading. I felt like one of the characters along for the adventure. Michael kept my interests peaked by painting very vivid mind pictures from start to end. Great read!
5,Exciting Historical Adventure,"The events recounted in The Revenant would make a compelling plot on their own. What makes this book incredible is the rare ability of the author to develop historical characters without sacrificing the flow of an amazing story. By the end of this book, you will be standing and cheering for Hugh Glass. All of these things make this a very fun book to read!"
2,OFF THEIR ROCKER,"Admittedly, casting Atlanta Braves' bad boy John Rocker as a serial killer was an inspired piece of casting. However, big John is hardly in the film at all. Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making. There are, however, some priceless lines: having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says ""I didn't even know they had a zoo.""A lame, tired rip off of all the slasher movies you've ever seen."
4,Don't let the picture fool you,So I really loved the picture of this product and when I got it it wasn't the same. It was the same as the picture as the chain and the shape and things of that nature but in the picture it has more of a grunge look to it but the actual product is just shiny steel and also the red streaks aren't colored in. I may have just gotten an unlucky draw with this but it doesn't look exactly as pictured which visuals was most of the reason I bought this. Also the chain was a little short for my neck and i had to creatively extend it so it won't look like a choker on me. I thought it was just because I had a fat neck but my friend has the same experience with it being just a little longer on him. Besides that it's really a great product and I like wearing it and the packaging is pretty nice too they give you a little tin with a clear face so you can see it. Very nice display.
3,quality,price-quality ratio is very good. Colour and size is very nice. very useful for me .I would recommend it.
1,Stolen,You can not buy Comcast equipment. If you have a Comcast cable box 'for sale' it was really not turned in and it will be labeled as stolen in their system and useless!!
4,Great book,"This book is pretty wonderful. It's not quite as good as the Anne and Emily books, but it is one that I love to re-read every so often. I can identify with Pat and her love for her home and not wanting things to change, but dealing with the changes and learning to get along in the world. The descriptions are great, and there are many funny and touching episodes. I also enjoy Judy's Irish dialect, it makes her a fun character. This is definitely a must-read if you like Anne and Emily and the others. However, the sequel, Mistress Pat, was not very good at all. I've only read that one once, but it was boring and seemed a bit pointless. But Pat of Silver Bush is excellent and highly recommended."
5,A good read,I had read many books by L. M. Montgomery but never this one. I really enjoyed this book and the sequel.
4,Even better than the last one!,"If you enjoyed Fastball's last release, ""All the Pain Money Can Buy"", you're sure to like ""The Harsh Light of Day"". The writing has improved (both music and lyrics), and they try some interesting new things such as the mariachi band on ""Love is Expensive and Free"". For the most part, these new experiments work! I would definitely recommend buying the limited edition of the CD while it is still around for the song ""Love Doesn't Kill You"" alone which is excellent."
2,"Safe, but damages car","This is one of the few large-rise class I mounts available. It is safe, but the design of the reinforcing spine rubs against the car's bumper, damaging the paint. Use it if you absolutely have to pull a trailer with a small car, but be prepared to accept paint scuffs on the bumper."
5,Top of the list.,"Unearth has come a long way from where they were at the start, this cd is amazing. Theres just something about this album and band that keeps hardcore alive. This cd is just awsome, the guitar solos and riffs are amazing. The drummer is intense and the vocals are awsome. This cd should be on the top of your most wanted hardcore list."
1,1 song stuck on repeat.,"I picked up Unearth the day it came out, I pop in it and became bored after the 3rd track. I love metal (all genres). I got into these new metalcore bands (Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, etc.)before it became the ""it"" thing, and after the 5th or so band I've gotten into, the genre has ran it's course. Ya really can't tell the newer bands popping up apart anymore, but that goes for all buzzing genres of metal. The guys in Unearth are no doubt great musicians, I respect that. Guitarists are very technical, why ruin good muscianship with repeation. A cd that every song sounds the same I can't vibe. Gimme just a bit of diversity please. A lot of people gripe about nu-metal, at least there was a lot more diversity. 2 years of the new metalcore and it will be the ""out"" thing, cause at this course, Unearth shows on this album, repeation is a murderer. So good luck with that."
2,Metalcore by the numbers,"This record is as unoriginal as it is rocking. The songs become a game of ""What band do they sound like now - Lamb of God (raspy growls), Killswitch Engage (vocal adlibs), or Shadows Fall (twin guitar harmonies)?"" Sometimes the group even sounds like Atreyu, another band of imitators, but minus Atreyu's gift for drama. Everything is well-played, and the bass tone is full and warm. But this is metalcore strictly by the numbers, sounding very ""2004."" It's time for chops this accomplished to get a sound of their own."
5,simply amazing,"This is one of the best metal/hardcore releases i've picked up over the past year. Unearth doesnt do anything i havent heard before...but they do it so well! the perfect blend of european metal solos and hardcore breakdowns. the clean vocals on ""Lie to Purify"" are excellent, though they are rarely used on the cd. The guitarists throw out awesome riffs, one right after the next. I cant find one thing wrong with this cd. buy it please!standout tracks are: ""Black Hearts Now Reign"", ""This Lying World"", ""Endless"", and ""Lie to Purify"""
5,The Ghost Dance Messiah,Entertaining as well as being very insightful.Interesting how white religion influenced this American Indian and especially how his teachings led in part to the battle at Wounded Knee.
2,Bad Quality Control,"I recieved a set of these glasses as a gift. I like the feel and the sturdiness of them, but there are some serious quality control problems mine have. Several the glasses are ""leaning"" to one side and most of them have high ridges around the sides where the two sides of the mold meet. I have had another style of A H glasses and also a measuring cup that have these ridges."
3,"Two sets, same leaning result","My issue with these is the quality control. They lean. Like the Tower of Pisa. Apparently, I am burdened with the obsession of needing symmetry. These things annoy the heck out of me when I use one. It's not the small tumblers that are an issue. It's the tall ones that you can clearly see. I even put a speed level on it to make sure I wasn't goofy. I returned the first set we gave to ourselves for Christmas. I just don't feel like exchanging them again to find the same issue with the next set. I let my wife use them and I've gone back to the old plastic ""kid proof"" cups.On a good note, they are heavy and feel very sturdy. I like the pattern as well. Amazon shipped the 2nd set without any hassle and pre-paid the return. Packaging was pretty good and none arrived DOA."
5,Perfect for low carbers and diabetics that want a great tasting sauce!,"Smokin' Joe Jones Low Carb BBQ sauce is flat out FANTASTIC! I have been following the low carb diet ""Protein Power"", which allows you around 30 carbs a day, since Febuary 1st. I have lost over 50 lbs so far. This sauce has become a mainstay for me on this diet. IT IS JUST SO GOOD. I grill with it, and sometimes use it as a dipping sauce.If you are following a low carb diet, or are watching your blood sugar, try this product. Your tasts buds will thank you.I need to go now--it's time for me to order another jar!"
3,Good interfaith book,"This book is good. Though I am still reading it, I find it uplifting but above all, it would be good for a course on interfaith studies."
1,Worst Bond movie I've seen.,"This is even worse than a view to a kill, the movie that made me swear off bond movies forever. Connery's hairpiece is the best special effect. Why does Blofeld have hair? Why isn't Bond's wife's death mentioned? Why the hell are the production values so low? They basically use pre-existing sets, and use them poorly at that. This movie is terrible, what a waste of a great storyline that arced through the first six movies. Oh, the music sounds like it was produced with two synthesizers and a poorly tuned guitar."
4,"Connery returns in the enjoyable ""Diamonds.""","Connery makes his triumphant return in ""Diamonds."" After diamonds are continuously smuggled into America, British authorities sieze a new recruit of the smuggling organization and drop Bond in his place to follow the pipeline as far as he can. Charles Gray, who portrayed Bond's contact in Japan in ""You Only Live Twice,"" portrays Ernst Stavros Blofeld, though not very accurately. As with Donald Pleasance in ""Twice,"" it is simply a case of miscasting. Another case of miscasting is Norman Burton as Felix Leiter. Coming across more like a recruit from ""Police Academy,"" he is harldy fit for the role. Aside from all the nitpicking, this movie is a lot of fun, even if it does require a bit more suspension of disbelief than usual. This is the last Bond film Connery would star in for twelve years, and his final one with MGM."
3,Only if you need to escape into 007 world,Great opportunity to see Sean Connery in the role that only he can play. Screenplay and supporting actors are awful.
5,Diamonds Are Forever,"Great movie. The stream didn't skip like Netflix did for this movie. Also, it was cheaper than renting at the movie rental store."
3,Mensa likes it.,"This is the complete, unedited review of The Jazz Crusade with permission as it appeared in the July/August 1992 issue of the Mensa Bulletin - the American Mensa magazine.Unquestionably a collector's item, this book contains a 70 minute compact disc, ""The Best of the Jazz Crusade""! As a musician, bandleader, promoter, record producer, and writer of the era, Big Bill (who hails from our Southern Connecticut chapter) has chronicled the revival of early black jazz, the beginnings of Preservation Hall, the influx of young white musicians into New Orleans, and the spread of the movement throughout the world. If names like Kid Thomas, George Lewis, DeDe Pierce and Jim Robinson mean anything to you, don't miss it.- Tom Elliott"
1,Horrid,"""Margaritaville"" is, quite simply, one of the worst songs of all time. Overrated and overplayed, Buffet has done nothing over that past 22 years but squeeze every ounce of publicity and marketing gimmick out of it. It is time he grew up, joined AA and looked for some other form of ""inspiration."""
4,A favorite book from childhood,"I read this book as a child and loved it. I sympathized with Caroline's frustration when her brothers got something because they were boys (in this case guns) that she was denied because she was a girl, and I admired her determination to make the best of what she did get (Maud). I only wish this book was available in e-book format because I lost my paperback copy a few decades ago."
3,not my kind of blues,"after buying kenny burrells midnight blue and blue bash and his playing on jimmy smith ""six views of the blues"" i thought this was a sure hit. i should have read the credits because i'am not a big fan of horns (trombones,reeds, etc) and this was not the bluesy laid back blues i was expecting. saying that, i was still marveled at this mans guitar playing. i like him more on the trio combos with the b-3."
1,Cheap and inaccurate,"This foreign-made gauge is cheaply made, prone to sticking and highly inaccurate. Sunpro should have better quality control on its products! The gauge frequently sticks as the engine warms. Tapping the gauge causes the needle to relocate almost randomly high or low making it unusable as an accurate real-time indication of the engine temperature. Eventually it is possible to get the needle to rest in about the correct location for what the temperature ""ought"" to be, but is it right? Who knows, because unless you tap it again, the needle does not change. Based on the engine thermostat, it should read about 185, but it is easy to get the needle to stop anywhere between about 150 to 230 degrees. If this particular gauge is representative, then do not waste your money. I just wish it was worth the effort to get a refund."
1,Absolute Junk,"The author states the obvious regarding the issue and its implications. However, he never gives any indication of techniques used to mitigate/eliminate his condition. This publication should be pulled from this site. It's insulting."
5,Keeps me from having to buy a new microwave ...,"Works with old Admiral microwaves as well and is a much less expensive ""fix"" than having to buy a new oven."
4,Good big band sound. brass section very good.,Nice big band sound with very good brass section but could use some help in sax section. Arranging needs some updating.
1,Packing and DVD menus are way below par,"I must say that apart from the content, this is about the most disappointing TV Series on DVD I've ever seen (and we own quite a few!).The packaging is absolutely the cheapest of the cheapest: two spindles in a card board box. The DVD menus is something that an intern would be ashamed of: the the selector boxes and arrows are completely unaligned with the choices. And of course: no subtitles. There is absolutely nothing good I can say about this product. But... I love the TV series."
3,missing from the box,the box set was great. the discs was great. but one thing that was not great about this complete series is that a disc was missing from the box. i was mad but got over it and got the disc that was missing. sorry to say do not get from amazon buy from a store like best buy or walmart u can take it back if something is missing from the box. 2012 - 2013
5,Another Sharpe one,"Tom Sharpe is the most hilarious writer. Ancestral vices is another piece of mad cap mayhem from the master.Fast paced laugh out loud parts. Its always one thing after another with Tom sharpe. Left-wing academics(Yapp)put up against,right-wing capitalists(the Petrefacts),throw in a sex toy factory a bunch of country bumpkins,and dwarves and this is what you get. Like I said total hilarious mayhem."
4,"Nevermind The O'Toole's and O. Morgan's, Here's Cole Porter!","The performances on this CD are uniformly great,from the rockin' to the sultry.Someone at Verve did a very good job selectingthe tracks and artists whose versions are on here.I think Cole himself would dig them."
5,Moving,"This documentary makes you feel for the people involved in sacrificing their lives, time, and families to bring civil rights to all people. The level of hatred for a person because of their race is deplorable in these documented events. I'm so happy they were able to overcome."
3,Greedy Willow?,"It took a couple of hours to get through Part 2 and 3 of ""The Lost Slayer"" series, because it was so thrilling, fast paced and I simply couldn't put the book down. Part Four was a tad depressing and simply put, the ""Thrall"" was gone. It became predictable and not in that ""Buffy will save the day"" way.The novel did cement the bond Willow and Buffy's friendship. It's nice to know that Willow often thought of Buffy as a sister and her belief in Buffy never wavered, even in the dismal future. The death of main characters had some emotional impact. Oz didn't irritate me, in fact, I respect his character more after reading Part four. The series is titled ""The Lost Slayer"", but Willow shines throughout. The reader will be impressed."
3,the price made this movie great,"This movie is an older film (for some reason it is considered a horror film?) and although a bit predictable and lacking some plot development in certain parts (leading to some plot holes) this third movie in the butterfly effect series was MUCH better than the second, which someone else has already mentioned as a film that had little aspiration to outshine its predecessor. Butterfly Effect 3 was at least a different take on the same concept. It was cheap entertainment, but I paid $5 total to be able to add this dvd to the collection here at home, so I'm pretty satisfied with my 5 bucks worth of movie."
3,not to bad & not to bad,"had to send 1st pair back to big now just ok for china and that is the main problem you just never know if anything is going to fit. my size 11 1/2 and I've had to go anywear from 10W to my size to get a fit on most shoe brands. The Bostonian is comfortable at the 1/2 size down (so I ended up with size 11D) for me and seems will made and comfortable, time will tell price was ok you could pay well over 100 bucks on this shoe. what happen to the USA guys,, at the top to greedy."
4,A strange world,"This is another one of Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""scientific romances"". Many early sci-fi writers wrote ""Hollow Earth"" stories, about civilizations in the center of the Earth. This is ERB's take on that. It is a totally implausible story, but it's darn entertaining. A young man and an old man travel to the center of the Earth by way of a digging machine. There they encounter prehistoric humans, dinosaurs and a race of intelligent reptiles. This being Burroughs, the young man naturally meets a beautiful cave girl and falls in love. It's an entertaining read, especially if you like pulp fiction."
2,"Glitter Prizes Perhaps, but VERY Superficial, Movie-Script Writing","The first of a trilogy, which I found much more like a TV-Script than a serious novel: a plethora of characters, most superfically defined, and few that I could care for, or even remember on completing the book. Fortunately the succeeding volume is substantially better, making it worth the chore of homework here."
3,Void of Intrigue,I find myself surfing through the tracks until I find one that is overall appealing. LTJ's performs great on his track but the cheesy vocals of DRS will find you flipping to the next song.Big Bud and Tayla do their share to bring some nice stuff but everything else is mediocrity.Your time is best spent on other efforts by Bukem.
1,"Little Joe, Super What?","Little Joe Superstar?This guy has been hustling people for decades. Anyone who has seen any movie, which included Dallesandro, would immediately learn that he has little to no serious acting ability. This book however, puts Dallesandro on some high ground. After reading it you might think he's speaking of an acadamy award winner.So I still can't believe that I purchased this book, but after looking through it it became clear that Dallesandro hooked up with someone with a similar background... The author simply has little writing ability."
3,easy to use,"I bought this for my daughter because it's easy to use. So far she's been happy with it, but it is a sony product, meaning that it might go out at any time."
2,Good for an ameture,"I loved the camera when i got it in the mail and everything was great. The camera is very easy to use but dosent have anything fancy that you can play with. Also after a while the lid where you open it to put your batteries a piece from the lid broke off, so now even if the betteries are charged i have to sometimes hold the lid myself because it dosent close all the way and the battery dosent reach the camwera the whole way. My friend has the same camera and a piece of her lid broke off too. Soits a good camera only for a while."
1,Hate it!!,I bought this item 7 months ago.It came with good condition but I hate the camera. Pictures aren't clear.The pictures taken with this camera are low quality and blurry. I wish I returned it. Don't waste your money with this camera.-Huri
4,Solid inspiration resource with artist-based articles. Love it!,"Working in paper mediums (photography, collage, paper sculpturals) I was happy to stumble upon this magazine last year. You will find articles and featured artists - primarily focusing on the media arts in the magazine's title. Consistently, this has been a source for both visual and written inspiration, and sometimes, direction and art-making sparks.Though the subscription price may be restrictive for some ('tis a bit pricey for the amount of issues per subscription), it's worth a look!"
5,Cloth Paper Sissors review,I love this magazine. Always something different. Great ideas. Fun reading.Definitely for those with a creative soul that need a little inspiration.
5,A Favorite for Schoolagers!,"When I ran a before and after school daycare in my home not long ago, I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe was one of the children's absolute favorite game choices. I owned quite a collection of games, from Barbie to Zoo Tycoon, but the mystery and puzzles of I Spy held their attention the most. The children ranged in age from 6 to 11, and I Spy was largely a favorite of the 6-9 year olds."
2,Outdated and incomplete...,"This 1991 volume is now old by 2 revisions of the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary. It was missing a few words even when it was current, and since the later revisions to OSPD, it is now short by several thousand words. My recollection is it also was not very sensibly arranged and was printed in difficult to read fonts. If you can read this review, you already have the ability to obtain word- study and list-generating software by download that is up-to-date, complete, more user friendly, and of greater utility, not to mention free, tho of course not as portable as this handy paperback."
5,The secret policeman's balls is superb!,I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD and am glad I have finally found it.I previously have only seen the U.S. version of the Policeman' other Ball and was riveted to my seat when I wasn't laughing my arsh off.
4,Something is missing,"I admit this is a great album but there really is something missing on this CD. I feel like every song is too short and doesn't rock enough. It's like, ""ok good chorus but the rest doesn't live into your head"". One great thing about the album, which makes it deserve a 4 stars, is the great voice (so improuved) of the clean singer. You can tell the production of this record was much better than the first one but the guitar riffs are not as powerful as in the first. I listen to this album when i feel like listening to soft music... that sounds weird considering their first album was kinda heavy.To conclude that review I would say if you expect to buy this album thinking of the old alexisonfire stuff then you should borrow it from a friend and listen to it atleast once before you buy it because it really is kindof a new band.my rating: 4/5great voice but doesn't rock enough."
2,What happened?,"I Have to admit this cd isnt even comarable to their debut, I dont know what happened. Some say georges throat bleeds when he yells, somesay they just wanted to make more money"
2,Read if you liked the debut...,"Watch Out! this album can really get on your nerves. This album hasn't been able to grow on me, and I have much better things to listen to, like their s/t debut. I listen to a lot of ""screamo"" or whatever you would like to call it and I will have to say that the debut is my favorite album in the genre. Maybe I am just an exception to the rule, but I had never heard such emotion in the screams and in the beautiful, timeless intros. And don't just download it, buy it and support an exceptional band who hopefully will realize the true sound of their gift by the time the next album is recorded."
4,"Different, but still the same band musically","This album shows a change in style vocally (more dallas and wade, less george), but is still packed of that raw alexis energy that any fan of this band loves. My only question is what does george do for the a lot of the songs on stage? Nevertheless, a great album definitely worth supporting one of the great independent bands still left!!!!!"
5,Whoa...,"Shocked doesn't begin to describe my reaction when I heard the new Alexisonfire album. My boyfriend played the first track for me and I was sold. Like, ho-ly crap. Definitely an improvement...definitely amazing."
4,"I can't say why, but its awseam","This Album is a pretty cool one, i am not into the whole Hardcore thing really, but i like these guys enough to listen to them. 'Accients' 'Control' and 'Sidewalk when She Walks' are my favs from this album. they have pretty interensting storys behind them.... that is if u can hear it! lol, still a good cd to buy if u like this kind of music"
2,No no no!,"What Alexisonfire does wrong is try and capitalize on the success of their peers by mending hardcore screaming, polished instrumentation, and slighty pop-punkish melody. Now, I am not one of those listeners who is going to complain on the deep end by saying the band sold out. In the end, rather it was their first effort or not --this band has never been considered true hardcore nor even that lamish title floating around, metalcore.What ""Watch Out!"" does ok is bring in back-up vocals that overshadow in terms of quality, the main singers' overly-done shrieks. I admit, ""Control"" is an awesome song...the chorus that swings in and out is nicely done but it is not enough of a saving grace to save an otherwise, stale, unmotivated and simply..lackluster album.To be quite honest, I really dislike music of this type, but alas I tend to give everything a go and I can't really suggest it other than for the deeply faithful fans."
5,perfect,"just what i needed. i have a pair of 14 hi hats, 16 crash, 18 ncrash, 20 ride, and 16 china and the protec bag holds them all with no problems trying to zip it up or anything. love it!"
1,Really Bizarre,"I found this book very strange. It is misrepresenting itself as a general college guide. The only people who would find it helpful are neo-conservatives whose only criteria in choosing a university is that it not have any ""feminists"" or ""multiculturalism"" on campus. It covers over 100 schools, dividing each review into 3 sections: academic life, political atmosphere, and student life. The reviews are rather brief and do not offer any helpful information (size, location, admissions, etc.) that could not be found in other college guides. The other information presented is highly editorialized. The authors seem a bit obsessed with bringing up random sexual harassment lawsuits, and the phrase ""politically correct"" appears on nearly every page. It's also obvious they have not done a lot of interviewing of current students and faculty."
5,The best system out there,"Well I searched alot for the best, and I bought the Peg-Perego but it was the worst! I had to exchange it three times. So finally I saw the reviews on the Chicco Cortina, and decided to go with it. Well all the reviews were right on, this is the best system. It is easy to use, and very nice. I dropped some juice on it and it cleaned right up! How NICE.... And EASE! wow, the stroller really can be closed with one hand. The infant seat is very lightweight, and the stroller with the adjustable handle... I just cant say enough, I just wish I had purchased this one first and never had to experience the other one.The Chicco Cortina is hands down the best system out there."
2,NOT a genuine Honeywell filter,"I bought this filter because it was described in the Amazon site as: ""Honeywell 24000 Replacement HEPA Filter by Honeywell."" I also bought it because the price, $67.78, was much higher than the off-brand filters being sold by many competitors. I also bought it because I had come to trust Amazon. It is NOT a Honeywell filter. It is a cheap off brand that's being offered at an unusually high price for a cheap off brand, and that's what fooled me. They're clever! I did get a refund, but my e-mails to Allergy be Gone and the time it took to pack the filters back up and take them to a special Fed-Ex outlet to return them totaled about 4 hours."
2,Lost Platoon,"Lost platoon I thought was a LOST BOYS/NEAR DARK/PLATOON type of movie. The concepts are somewhat there, the actors are not though. The acting is very bad, the production ... there's not much blood for a movie that's suppose to be compared to Platoon. It has a good concept but it could have been done a hundred times better...I found it very boring. Some like some may not. This is one person who did not like it."
2,American Experience: Last stand at Little Big Horn,"I was a little disappointed in the video. I had read the book Killing Custer and wanted this video to suppliment the book. Without reading the book, or others on the same subject, this video alone does not offer much."
4,ONE FOR THE COLLECTION!,"They did some great casting with this one! This is one for the collection!Poetri killed me with the piece on Krispy Kreme. Whoa!Black Ice, Ursula Rucker (she is the chick at the end of all The Roots records spittin' venom).Philly poets have it on smash!! Need I say more.Ohh and the Philly rapper Rosco P. Coldchain! Wow! He blew me away! If he doesn't make you understand ghetto life, you'll never get it. He broke it down!Mums! That guy is a problem! He brings the same energy he gives you on OZ to the stage. Raw!Flaco Navaja, what a beast. Nothing like a passionate Latin with crazy verbal skillz!Too many others to go into. Definitely a great buy."
3,HIGHLY ENTERTAINING,"My church friends and I are addicted to Sequence,it is the highlight of our fellowships. We usually play on the smaller board sold in stores everywhere, but everyone was amazed and intrigued by the size of Jumbo Sequence. No more complaints of headaches and bluriness. Great for kids too!"
5,Sequence Jumbo,"Introduced to this game and it is a fun game to play. Does call for a little mental work, but not enough to stress a person. The Jumbo board is a real plus as I do not think that my eyes could handle looking at the small board"
4,Excellent,I wish it had been a text for one of my classes. Had to discover it later. Well...a worthwhile discovery. It doesn't get 5 stars only because I hardly ever give anything 5. Probably 4.75.
5,A must for John Prine fans,"Although I'm 62, I only became a fan last year. I bought several CDs and just got a DVD player, so had to get Sessions at West 54th. I am delighted by the production, the technical quality of the camerawork, video and audio but especially with the music. Jason Wilber is terrific on guitars of various kinds, and Dave Jacques is a masterful bass player. J.P. takes everything in stride and seems to be having a great time, especially with Iris DeMent. I'll be playing this many times."
3,It is what it is,"Pretty good DVD, I was just disappointed it didn't have more of his better known hits. One of the songs it did have was a little to crass for my tastes."
4,Off the cuff fun,Fun read. So many illustrations of things you never think about until you see it in print and it dawns on you as to how comical we sometimes speak.
3,"Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other...","A quick read of wording you normally don't realize is redundant. Funny at times. You realize that you use them quite often, too."
5,impressed,"writing a sequel to a best seller is hard for a lot of writers to do well,but John jakes delivers! This book has all the action,richness of historical people,places,events and hot romance as the prior book;but is fresh and exciting. A continuation in the Kent family story worth reading."
3,Rebels/Bastard Review,"I love works on the American Revolution so I decided to read The Bastard and The Rebels as a 2 series book, as the rest of the Kent Chronicles have no interest for me at all.I loved the bastard (4 out of 5 stars)Yes it was cheesy with its high melodrama (Alicia and Roger just happening to show up at a wim was pretty juvenile) But the story was intense and Phillipe was a BACKDROP to historical events.The Rebel is a different story. The fictional characters take over, leaving the history of the era largely to discussion between them. This is disapointing. The historical aspects of Jakes novels are a strong point in otherwise infantile prose.The character of Judson Fletcher is so ridiculously drawn that he is in no way redeemable or loathsome....really 7th grade writing at this point.Overall I give the Rebel 3/5 for at least discussing interesting topics.If you really are into the revolution Jeff Sharra's 2 book series is much better. But that is a personal choice for you to make"
1,Hmmmm,"You'll be in for a surprise with this one. And I don't just mean the absence of the customary polemic from the mind of Maestro Mehldau spread across the liner notes. To these ears Brad Mehldau is a piano genius who has produced some of the outstanding jazz piano efforts of recent years. But don't expect another singing, sad and lilting piano trio effort here or perhaps one of his ruminative solo offerings. 'Largo' is a serious departure from his usual fare. The musicians on this CD are all out of the top drawer, no question about that, it's just that they are all over the place. Think latter-day Waits, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink drama, meets a Piano Prepared by a Radiohead. That kind of thing. Nice jacket by the way."
1,Musac Par Execelence,"A very disappointing CD, full o elevator music! What a shame such a talented pianist (in my humble opinion, the best young Jazz piano player) gets involved in a project such as this!"
2,"Darn, I wanted to like it!","This is the first Mehldau CD I've owned and I tried to like it. He plays brilliantly... but in this CD he is painfully self-indulgent. That's bad enough, but add in the persistent, johnny-one-note drums (Matt Chamberlain) and burdensome acoustic bass (Larry Grenadier)...and ouch! I'm going to trade this one in for another better Mehldau. Sorry, I wanted to like it!"
1,"out of date, not very useful","This book dates back to 1999, and since I'm writing this in 2006, that's seven years ago. Seven years is a long time for computer documentation. Virtually everything in the book is so far out of date that it's useless. The authors also didn't do a very good job of staying on topic; there are many long digressions that are neither interesting nor useful. In many cases, the authors merely give a broad-strokes outline of how to accomplish a particular task, or talk about several different approaches that have been taken by different people, without concluding with anything very helpful about how to actually accomplish the task."
1,Typical western of the 1950s,"I first saw a preview of New Mexico at the St. James cinema in Brisbane in the early 1950s. As a young boy I was most impressed. It is a typical western from the 1950s, similar to Bugles in the Afternoon and Warpath. The film was photographed in Ansco color but this VHS transfer is in black and white and consequently it does not do justice to the landscape photography. In fact, this VHS transfer is a total disgrace and the video production company should hang its head in shame. Much of the tape is so dark that it is unwatchable. The picture is grainy and out of focus. I am sorry that I purchased this video for it was a complete waste of money. I am going to throw the tape in the rubbish bin as I have no use for it. So prospective buyers, please take heed and do not purchase this VHS tape."
3,an olidie but a goodie,"Bought the album for three of his greatest hits, was worth it. If you like Steve Miller Band and don't have this album, I recommend it. It still sounds good in places after all these years."
5,Worth it!!,"By now, with all the bad reviews circling the internet, the price of this game in most stores will be somewhere around $10-$15 (I got mine for $7.50 and they parctically thanked me for taking it off the shelves).Now don't get me wrong this game is no where near the classic adventures that most avid gamers hold close to their heart but that's not what we are comparing this to,we're just asking whether this is worth the money. Good graphics, fun, and easy-going gameplay for just $10.00? Of course it's worth it.Just look at what everyone's shoving this game to the side for. Dialouge???? They just need a reason to shove this perfectly good game into the garbage so they can feel like they agree with the all-mighty reviewers. If you are a person reasonably into adventure games and need a game to play, I must say this game is well worth your money."
3,It ain't Easy,"Grabs you at the start, only to let you go the more you know. A ""Body Snatchers"" variation."
2,too much and not enough,"I liked the concept, and the story was OK. I could have done with less of the black sex experience... lines like ""my fathers large black *****"". Yes, that is part of the book. A serious lack of love and making his God out to be just an advanced amoebic life form... Could have been deeper in parts, but I really didn't need to know other parts. Then there was the government white man exploiting and destroying. Kind of felt like an oppression theme. I would recommend if you can handle the dealing with the authors non-emotional, graphic, somewhat vulgar sexual exploits."
3,Inventive,"There is a perceived threat to mankind. An ancient organ-ism capable of restoring life to the dead. It has remainedhidden for centuries near the core of the earth , butit has now surfaced , cloaked in a human exterior.Errol's father is back from the dead nine years afterpassing. Or is it really his father? A team of govern-ment assembled goons , have been monitoring the move-ments of both men. Nostalgia and a sense of empathy,thrusts Errol into the unlikely role of hero. Placingthe future existence of an entire species squarely inhis hands.Mosley tells this story with the spacey contentexpected of a sci-fi tale , but juxtaposes it nicelywith elements of humanity. What robbed this book ofan additional star was the flaky relationship depictedbetween Errol and his girlfriend , and the silly sexualencounters he indulged in with other women. Bothbelonged in a different book."
5,Great Deal on Drill,Low price and this drill bit cuts through anything. Most bang for the buck. Why pay high prices for large drill bits when these are out there?
5,My Favorite Lip Balm,"This is my new favorite lip balm -- I received it as a gift from Paris. It actually plumps my lips and soothes ... it is great under any lipstick or gloss. I will never be without this lip balm again, use it morning and night! Highly recommend ... it lasts quite awhile too"
5,A new favorite,"I love this stuff! Not having any issues with grittiness or dryness mentioned by others. I've been using natural/organic lip products for awhile, so maybe I'm used to less glossy formulas. This lip balm is thick, luxurious and lasts forever. I much prefer it to thinner balms that need reapplying every hour. A little definitely goes a long way."
5,Jumble Madness: Crazy for Jumbles (Jumble Series),"A paradise for jumble fanatics! it's a wonderful way to pass time on a car trip, or while you are watching TV.Would recommend for anyone who loves jumbles. There are move jumbles in every puzzles verses the Newspapers version. Some are hard most are very common words."
2,Beware of front covers and page displays,"The front of the book displays a jumble of 6 words, each comprised of 6 letters. However, out of 180 jumbles, 160 are 4 words, 2 of 5 letters and 2 of 6 letters leaving only 20 jumbles matching the page display. I feel the cover and page display are very misleading and would not recommend it to an adult seasoned jumble enthusiast. I would have appreciated a more accurate description of the contents."
4,LOVE THIS!,"I use these Jumbles in my English classroom on a daily basis, both as extra credit and team-building exercises. The students love the challenge of solving these puzzles, and the best part: they don't realize they are building vocabulary."
1,Scoop bob the builder,no dimensions in description and is way to small wouldn't recommend the size is alittle bigger than a matchbox car
1,Misleading,The photo was wonderful but misleading. I thought for that kind of money the toy would be much bigger. Feel extremely disappointed and ripped-off.
4,Great product,Excellent product ! Works well and quiet.Product has an easy to change filter andergonomic to use. So far So good !
2,Not what was ordered,Ordered one model and received a different one. Returned to shipper very easy and they said a lot of people had same issue.
5,"air cleaner cleans well, is loud on max","happy with this unit, bit bigger than thought but still ok with it. much more efficient than the smaller ones - good for living rm/dining rm combos or large basements."
1,"Loved it, until it quit working.","I own the Honeywell 50250 and loved it. I bought it because it was a Consumer Reports' best buy. It cleaned the air of cigarette smoke better than anything I've ever owned. But, mine quit working after 2 months. The switch gave out.It has a 5 year warranty, but according to the instructions, you have to mail the unit back, which is a huge bummer. It's not so much the fact that you have to enclose a check for $15 to get warranty service, but the fact that I'm gonna have to trudge down to the post office. I can't recommend anything that costs > $100 and quits working after 2 months. By the way, even though this is branded as a Honeywell, the manufacturer is a company called Kaz, according to the instruction manual."
4,Works as expected,"We are happy with our purchase, with an air purifier you can never really tell if it is working or not. We got it because one of our pets has severe asthma and we thought it might help, she is now on steroid medicine and so that is doing the trick, but we have had guests come over and they said they could notice a difference in the air quality. We live in a basement apartment so we dont get the best air flow. It is loud but it just sound like a fan and we dont mind the noise, some people might but i find the noise relaxing. just purchased a replcaement pre filter online (needs changing every 3 months) and it was only 11 dollars so thats not bad either."
4,Great air purifier,"This Honeywell Air Purifier is doing an excellent job. The only possible drawback is that on high it is noisy. Medium is tolerable, and low is fine. Does the job that we bought if for."
4,excellent full room filter,"This one is the fourth I have purchased and all are still functioning very well. It truly removes smoke and animal odor from the house. Amazon has the best price by over 30 dollars, good shipping and the unit arrived on time and in good shape."
3,No Support,"The product works very well. However, when I needed a plastic part that holds the bottom cover on, there was just no way they were going to help me. The plastic disintegrated after about a year, or maybe I screwed the fastener too tight. Anyway, a huge disappointment as far as customer service."
5,Great Buy,"I have noticed a significant difference after a few weeks of letting this sucker run. I used to wake up with a stuffy nose and headaches which I thought may be caused by the air in my 1 bedroom apartment. This thing is handling all 900 sq ft very well in my opinion. It is a little noisy, but even in a small living room it isnt noticeable when I have the TV on."
4,A Good Purchase for the Basement,"Purchased - February 08 - To eliminate cat odorsPositives: Our male cat has sprayed in the basement, even after a lot of cleaning, the odor lingers. This air cleaner has done the job and eliminated the smell. We leave it on all the time.Deltas: It is loud. Too loud for our bedroom or living room. When we watch tv in the basement we turn it to low or off. We purchased an excellent Rabbitaire for the bedroom.Overall: Worth the $."
4,A bit noisy but works well,"This Honeywell 50250 Air Purifier works well but is a bit noisy, even on the lowest setting. We keep it on all night in our bedroom so we have gotten used to the sound. The other thing to consider is that this unit needs to be placed 3 feet away from any wall so it can't be tucked in a corner or up against a wall. This is because the air flow goes in from all sides and flows out at the top perimeter."
4,Honeywell 50250N Air Purifer,"It was pretty easy to setup. I did not feel any drastic change in the air quality as other reviews stated but my wife did point out initially that she felt freshness in air.It is noisy even at the lowest fan setting. I also bought a RabbitAir which has almost no noise at the lowest speed and its noise at highest fan speed is less than what this model of Honeywell has at its lowest fan setting. However, RabbitAir price is twice as much as this one."
1,Disappointed!,"I was so excited to get this after so much research. Today it came and I followed the assembly instructions-very easy-turned it on, and....nothing!!! I couldn't believe it. I reread the instructions, took it apart and did it again, had my husband check it, called Kaz, they were closed, so the thing just doesn't work. Tried different outlets to no avail. Will be sending it back to amazon for an exchange. Hope I get a different one that actually works!"
2,It's way too loud even on low!,"I purchased this after have 3 failed Holmes units, hoping that the 5 star ratings saying that the noise was worth it were true. But I have a medium-sized apartment, and even if I put this unit on low on the other side of the room it is still way too loud. Its too loud to even try to get used to the noise, even on low. It sounds like a leaf blower on high.I do not think it's worth the noise. If you're looking for something to put in your bedroom or living room where you spend a lot of time, this is not the one for you, at all!"
3,"Effective, but loud","I purchased this unit based on online feedback, people saying that it was simply the best filter in its price range.That may be true, but unfortunately, it's incredibly loud, especially in a small apartment or room. In my apartment, the filter was sufficiently loud on its medium setting that I could hear it with both fingers in my ears. The quieter setting is, unfortunately, not that much quieter.It may be an excellent air filter, but for me, in my apartment, it was so loud that I wouldn't be able to keep it on at all while I was at home. So, I returned it. Your mileage may vary."
2,Timing,"I bought a Honeywell 50250N air purifier for a Christmas gift. I ordered it on Dec.7, 2007. My daughter recieved it 7 days later & product did not work. So, she sent it to back to Allergy Be Gone per Amazon. They just recieved it Jan.2, 2008. It was not processed promptly. Thank you but would shop somewhere else."
5,Still deciding whether to paint it to look like R2D2 or not..,"Like all the other reviews, it cleans the air, and does so very well. Yes, it is loud, even on low, but unless you're a physics professor from MIT you're not going to sell me on ""rock salt"" air cleaners or devices that simply sit in the corner and do not move air through an actual filter.If you're in an apartment with no central air, no overhead fan's or neighbors who smoke this is going to truly make your space feel overall cleaner. Would recommend to anyone in an apt."
4,Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier,It set up quickly with the filters I purchased. There had been an odor from the mold and plastic and it quickly took care of this issue. It is a bit noisy but works great as white noise. I haven't change the filter yet. I like the idea of replacing filters even though it may be a bit more costly. Overall this is a good product.
5,Met expectations,The product has been working well and meeting my expectation.It has given relief and better sleep at night.
5,Easy to use. Easy to breathe.,"Works great. No need to buy new filters. just vaccum the existing one. It gave out some funny smell initially, but after a week or so, it was gone."
4,Works Great but Large!,"This air purifier does it's job well. I have had it for more than a month and I have considerably less dust in the house and less animal hair floating around. However, I must admit that I didn't pay close enough attention to the size of it before I made my purchase. I was more concerned with getting something that worked well within my price range (since I have not had satisfactory success with other similar products).I was stunned by the size of it. I live in a small house and this machine is the size of a foot ottomon or a small chair - needless to say it takes up a lot of room in my living room. But I can live with that and so can the animals. :-)"
4,"Frustrating at times, but a good book!","I didn't really like the father's part in the story-it was confusing and the sex scenes were a little too descriptive...I loved the rest of the family, though. The ""angel"" child especially got my attention. She was so talented and interesting! I fell in love with her (figure of speech...) ! The ending was very poetic. I liked this book a lot and highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet"
4,"Love, loyalty & devotion triumph over disfunctionality.","The Canary family turn the terms ""marginal"" and ""disfunctional"" inside out. Every member of this family has severe physical and/or emotional and/or psycological problems. Yet, they still enjoy a rich family life that, in many ways, is defined by love, loyalty and devotion. And this fact is the underpining of this book and, probably, society at large. For while they suffer mightily, they do so, largely, together and, in remaining together, forge the bonds that ultimately allow them to survive and, in some ways, flourish.This is a rich, deeply spiritual book in many ways, though the prose can, and often does, take on a coarse, often vulgar character--again, a lot like life itself.In the end, the books is a study of the difference between happiness and contentment in working through the difficulties of life.I heartily recommend the book. One is well warned, however, that at times the coarseness of the manuscript can be unsettling."
5,"Find a guide rope from the tent and tie it to that stone,","Mathew and Kayak went looking for Mathew's father, that have not yet arrive on their trip to see the big piece of copper in the north. Mathew and Kayak went looking for them in the middle of frozen place."
2,Software Limitations,"We used this tool during our MBA studies but found that the limitations of the software are not identified and after carrying out a survey of 120 people found that we could only do analysis on 40 of the 120 we typed into the system, because of this we believe that there should be a section that explain, in detail, the limitations of the software."
4,Better than the picture,"Be sure to note that the picture is totally incorrect, but that's a good thing. The cutlery is as pictured, but the block has been redesigned into a slimmer and taller piece, which for me was a lot better. You counter space is not threatened this way. The handles appear to be kind of a cheap plastic (reason for subtracting a star), but the blades all look high quality and there is a sharpener included in case they get dull, and unlike the red handled set, these are dishwasher safe. So if you are looking for a $50 set of knives, this is recommended as a good replacement set, or a nice wedding gift for a young couple."
4,A good album.,"Unfortunatly Kim Wilde didn't have quite enough hits to fill an entire album, but at least all the good ones are on this one. From Kids in America to Cambodia, they're all here and they still sound great...am I really that old?"
4,Excellent,"This book in conjunction with the more ""technical"" Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell, is awesome for learning to write and read the ruq3a script used in Arabic handwriting. The reason I haven't given it the full 5 stars is that it doesn't have extensive handwriting examples for recognition practice, but if used in conjunction with Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell this is solved, as there is quite a few handwritten examples at the end of the latter. Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell is indeed very costly, $60, but shop around, I got mine almost new for $20."
1,Yucky,"I thought this looked so nice in the picture--but I was so horrified when it came that I never even tried it on. It is definitely more sweater than jacket, and the material is thin. It is also sparkly--there are small glitter-like pieces in the fabric. Looks appropriate for an elderly woman."
3,Hmm,"Let me make one thing clear - I did not give this book a lower rating because I am a Christian who is offended by this author's portrayal of Biblical figures. In fact I'm not even a Christian at all.I did like the history of the characters and their changes from Bible canon. What the author did for Mary's story did not bother me the least, and it did intrigue me, as well as what was done for Mariamne and 'Simon'.What bothered me was the writing. In some parts the writing was awkward and repetitive. I remember one thing that grated me, it was like, 'a table of some sort with a machine of some sort' and that really bothered me, and there is also repetition in some sentences that was really unneccessary. If the writing would have been more polished and some of the kinks taken out, the story would have flowed along better."
1,The secret of the magdalene,I really did not care for this book at all. Not at all what I was expecting. Too much magic and it was so hard to get into. I read probably 3 other books while i was trying to finish this one. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone
2,Let's keep it that way.,"Not one of the worst books I've ever read but pretty close. Sorry I bought it and am not passing it on to friends. Perhaps it was the subject matter that first intrigued and in the end alienated me but I had to force myself to finish because I couldn't believe the plot. I kept hoping for some relevant message. Mary Magdalene, the original feminist and Mary the Mother of God, the worn out, bitter, stay at home Mom? I won't even try to describe her take on Jesus. Not my cup of nectar. I'll certainly make every effort to keep this book a ""secret""."
2,Seek your VR story elsewhere,"This book has almost nothing to do with virtual reality, and left me feeling somewhat ripped off. All dystopia, no VR. And he named it Virtual Light!If you're interested in a good VR read, check out Tad Williams's Otherland series instead. Much, much more entertaining. Gibson is sadly overrated."
2,Painfully bad (and I LOVE Gibson's work),"Please please please do not let this be your first or only Gibson book. It is incredibly shallow, trite and painfully contrived. Get Neuromancer instead, because it is a much more deeply woven story."
1,Very Real Waste of my Time,"I read this book based on the reviews here and also based on a Wikipedia article about the bridge trilogy.None of the characters is memorable in fact, I could not care less about any of them. The stolen glasses simply did not add anything to this book, it wasn't even a coherent story! Character meandering about San Francisco, describing the city really did not help the story.This was simply a collection of words thrown together without any semblance of a story.i will not be reading anything else by this author, I should have borrowed this book from the library!"
2,Mystified by good reviews,"Well, at least it's easy to read.Everyone and their sister has been telling me this is a must-read, and I'm left wondering why. The writing is weak, the character development nonexistant, the ""suspense"" not at all suspenseful, the dialogue hokey with *italics* all *over* the *place*, and the plot not terribly engaging. This novel could have been condensed into a 50-page short story, and nothing would have been lost."
3,Still better than TV......,"COPS IN TROUBLE.....messenger chicks on bikes....californias acting like everyone else....and a neat piece of technology lost in it all....even a 48 hour mini-series couldn't hit all the details, characters and twists and turns........keep you seatbelt on!And it continues even faster in the next book!"
4,Total package is lacking,"Consumer report said ""machine is the best, the wood case it comes with is destined to break in the back of a pickup"" Well I like to buy the best of everything when I can so I bought the ""Lamello Top 20"" Sure enough the machine is top end, everything is crisp, clear easy to read and supper tight,no slop. I have never used a better plate jointer. The bad? Well my case was broke when I took it out of the delivery box. The wood case is so cheap it belongs with a kids Christmas toy. Kinda ruins the whole package. Plan on an alternate means of transporting this tool."
5,Room Enough for Pro Tripod and Ball head,"Bought this case to protect my Bogen Manfrotto Carbon Fiber tripod. That big tripod fits easily inside the PSTC300 with room to spare. And, that is with the Markins M10 ball head mounted on the Bogen."
2,Would Be Better as a Booklet,"Others have already stated my opinion. The useful points in this book would be better stated in a booklet. The authors ramble on needlessly when, in reality, they should have backward-mapped their own main points, stated them, and then stopped typing. The extra babbling detracts from the main points: backwards mapping and six facets. This stuff would stick in the reader's mind more if the authors got out of the way, but then I suppose they wouldn't make dough by selling textbooks would they?"
5,An Artist Everyone Should Hear!,"Mat Kearney is an artist who in my opinion is the very definition of talent. While ""Nothing Left to Lose"" is primarily acoustic-driven, Mat is able to blend piano, spoken verse (rap), hip-hop beats, and soaring pop choruses into something really refreshing and extraordinary.Clever and emotional lyrics resonate throughout this amazing disc. Stand out tracks are 'Undeniable', 'All I Need' (brilliant track), 'Where We Gonna Go From Here' (I just LOVE the toy piano overlaid with the chorus), and the track that showcases his musical genius, 'Nothing Left To Lose'.My highest recommendation and I feel the finest CD of 2006!"
3,Not what I expected...,"When purchasing Mat Kearney's CD I based my decision to buy off of the songs ""Nothing Left to Loose,"" and ""All I Need"" which are great songs. However, upon listening to his CD I discovered the soulful and pretty tunes that encompassed the two songs stated above were not what I got. Half of the CD consists of ""Christian rap"", which is okay, if you like that type of stuff; but I don't even like ""regular"" rap so it's not my cup of tea. So if you're expecting a light and fluffy CD full of lovely, sweet music than think twice before buying this CD. If you like Christian rap and a mix of sweet and light hearted music in with it, than go for it!"
5,A new twist in romance,"Her Galahad is a fresh new voice in romance. If you've grown tired of the same old stories, you won't be bored with Her Galahad. Using true happenings in Australian history, Melissa James has crafted a story of intrigue, betrayal, and love that overcomes some pretty steep obstacles. I loved the story and the characters, and I'm looking forward to more from Ms James."
2,PULLEASE,"""Bob Roberts"" was Tim Robbins first foray into political filmmaking. He draws on his family experience as traveling folk singers and fashions a story of a conservative, religious political candidate who sings family songs on the campaign trail. The film itself is good stuff, well acted and produced, but the message is clear: White conservative Christians are just frauds and cannot be trusted. One watches it and wonders what a truthful depiction of Jesse Jackson would look like. Or an inside look at Joseph P. Kennedy pulling the strings in Jack's Congressional and Senate campaigns? Or the inside deals that kept Teddy Kennedy in office after Mary Jo Kopechne was killed? How about Al Sharpton and the Tawana Brawley incident? ""Bob Roberts"" is one of those movies that you just watch and shake your head."
2,This...,"...album contains masterful musicianship & overall production by the great George Duke BUT the album really lacks strong songs & somewhat strong arrangements. The songs are a little ""saucy"" arranged & lack variations in tempo which makes the album a sleeper. The definate standout track is ""Corcovado"" which is magnifically played & arranged (check out the bass chops throughout the whole track!).The true pitfall is the vocal production though. There appears to be none!(?). It seems ms. Belle has total freedom & uses it to the extreme. She NEVER quiets down(!) & ad-libs everywhere on EVERY track which makes the album really tiresome after a couple of tracks & leaves the impression of being very ""2nd rate night-clubbish""..."
3,"Not bad. Not good either, but not bad.","This isn't a bad movie. The special effects (actually -- the only special effect) were well done. The music was chilling, and the atmosphere was enveloping.The problem is that this looks like a horror film. It isn't. It's more of a ""feel somewhat creepy for an hour"" film, and it excels at that."
2,Extremely Boring. Is This Really Supposed to Be Scary??,"I Would Love to know one thing. WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND, WOULD PUT THIS MOVIE IN THE AFTER DARK HORRORFEST??? I Have seen More Frightnening Movies, in The Drama Section! Besides That, It Is Extremely Boring. Basically, It is a Very Slow Documentary, About this woman for the First Hour. The Only, Reason My Review is a 2 Star, is because of the Last 24 Minutes Of The Movie. Still, Wasn't Scary, But it got a little Bit Better, That's The Only thing that saved it, from being the worst movie of all time."
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE","Please, don't be caught up in the babble of any rating above one star. Having watched this movie I have to say that there is no story, there is no horror, there is not anything to write about this movie other than 'avoid at all cost'. It fails on every level. The plot is lacking - in fact it's so bad you cannot follow it.If you don't believe how bad it is, I highly suggest you Google 'The Broken' and read the myriad reviews that explain how bad it is.Do not watch, do not rent, do not buy."
5,Harmolodic Free Funk Jazz,"This music alternately rocks, wails, is pensive and quirky. I love the compositions and musicianship of the players. This is one of my favorite Ronald Shannon Jackson recordings. It's only bested by ""Barbeque Dog"""
2,Nothing MUCH HERE,"Nothing much here, just a economic writer throwing data after data to comprobe his theories about the doom of mankind ..."
3,Unusual stories but all too short,"I always love stories by Megan Whalen Turner: The Thief trilogy and the short story in the anthology book Firebird.So I picked this one and read it as soon as possible. The witty and funny characters were there and unusual plots were told but somehow, I felt only a small elation. It might be because the stories were too short for any enchanting moments to develop and those were plentiful in The Thief trilogy.Nevertheless, I am still looking forward to reading more 'heavy' books from the author."
1,Who cares about her wasted life?,"When Annie Duke dies, what are people going to say about her? ""She had a messed up family life and neglected her four children, but she played a pretty good game of poker."" Big deal. She's wasting her life, and this book is proof.And the book is flawed. She describes a hand where she has a king-high strait, but claims to have an ace-high straight. Even amateur poker players like me immediately noticed that error. It's simply unacceptable in a book like this. The equivalent would be Michael Jordan mentioning the NBA's 35-second shot clock in his biography, when in reality it's a 24-second clock. It's laughable. When a professional poker player can't get the rules straight, I have to seriously doubt her credibility. Don't waste your time with this unless you want to be bored and become confused with the rules of poker."
3,Slipper sizes would have helped!,"I bought these slippers after reading how comfy they were to others, but there needs to be more SIZING info on this site. Mediums are 6.5 to 7.5 US sizes. Hope this helps someone who is planning on ordering! It would have helped me, that's for sure! Hope my granddaughter can wear them."
5,cute and practical,"These are attractive, feminine ballerina slippers. My husband thinks they are cut on me too! They are comfortable, cushioned nicely and wash well. I first bought these at a top rate store and was delighted years later to find them available on-line. I bought two pairs!"
3,Not like the ones I bought over 10 years ago. :-),"Well, ok, I have to admit in thinking about it, how could Isotoner make them with the same quality rubber soles like they did in the late 1990s or early 2000s? They'd never turn a profit if they didn't try cheaper materials and a cheaper manufacturing technique. I live in the south, so I don't use them a whole lot which is why the old pair lasted.Not maintaining the quality gives this a three star rating, however, they are comfortable and more stable than the pair of Dearfoams I tried a couple of years ago. I tossed the Dearfoams because I couldn't walk in them because the uppers were so low in quality that they slipped all over my feet.These uppers are more stable, but if quality continues to degrade, then I will have to source slippers elsewhere. I don't think they are worth $20 and I am glad I got the color that was on sale.I wear a size 8.5- 9 and the Large fit well."
1,They only look tough,"I got these tire levers because they had good reviews and they looked extremely sturdy for their weight. They're worthless! The very tip on both the big and little lever broke off the first time I used them! Don't waste your money on these if you want a firm tire lever, bite the bullet on weight and get some aluminum ones."
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,Facts are well written in other reviews.Mine worked for 2 months (what a good luck!!)I just tried to clean the sensor (because it's the one that makes the problem) and finally broke it.I would not try to replace it because it will cost me $10 and what I'll get for it will be another junk.
1,Didn't last very long.,"I had confidence in the brand as I've had a number of Holmes humidifiers in the past, all lasting between three and six years (winter only usage). This model quit producing mist in less than three weeks. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy."
1,Very bad design,This unit is all looks no performance. It worked great for me for about 2-3 weeks then it just stopped producing mist. I assume it is made with very cheap electronic components. I believe the units fail when they run out of water and dont automatically turn off like they should.
2,"Frustrating, soaks the area around it","I wanted an ultrasonic humidifier that is easy to clean. I don't like the ones with filters and wicks you have to change constantly and we had a sunbeam ultrasonic that works great, but is a bit hard to clean.However, this one, despite having variable controls for the output, seems to put out a constantly heavy stream of moisture. So, if you leave it running all night, it saturates the area around it. We tried putting down a towel and it soaks it. I want the moisture in my air - not my carpet.It is nice and quiet and easier to clean, but I can't overcome the soaking problem. I am planning to return this item.I am planning to return this item."
1,What's lower than 1 star?,"Short version. I bought it. It worked once, though the floor seemed damper than the air. The next time I woke to the smell of burning plastic. Now it's dead.Long version: it comes with an endless list of things you should do, including emptying it and cleaning it after each use, cleaning the sensor, blah-blah-blah. But come on... Two days of use?It's garbage. Don't buy it."
2,mold,"As a mom of four, I have plenty of experience with sippy cups. Seeing this one in the store, I thought that the handles were nice and chunky for little hands to grip and the straw was just right for a little one's first experience with straws. Having used it for months now, I think the design is good, the execution is poor - this thing seems to create mold from thin air. I only use two sippy cups with my 1 year old, so I am washing both of them on a daily basis...DAILY, not a few days go by and I find it all gross and have to spend extra time cleaning it. I mean that if anything other than water is in this cup for more than 12 hours, there will be mold in the straw, the lid, the cup and everywhere in-between. I have never seen anything like it. So if you just want to use it for water, then it is probably a great cup. If you want it for juice or milk, find something else."
4,Not as good as Munchkin's straw cup,"My son got this cup when he was 13 months old. He throws everything off his highchair, and when he throws this cup down, the handles come off the cup. The cup is durable, and hasn't cracked yet, but when I removed the straw to clean it, I couldn't put it back in all the way so it leaks when he throws the cup now. We still use the cup though, but the Munchkin straw cup handles the blows to the floor much better."
3,Dogs not a total dog,"We bought this to play for the kids at church, and I was skeptical. It's a better movie than the title implies. Lot's of cliches' but reasonably well acted. And we didn't have to worry about content."
1,Not my favorite movie,"I know, I know! Not every movie has to have a character building lesson. This movie however, celebrates the opposite-lying, stealing, breaking and entering, and cheating. In the end, the children were celebrated as heroes dispite their bad behavior."
5,Hotel For Dogs DVD,Great movie. Sad story that wraps up with a happy ending and all the dogs get homes of their own. My 8 year old daughter loved it and seeing all the different breeds of dogs.
2,Lonely Planet Cantonese Phrase Book,"I am an American born Cantonese speaker and grew up bilingual, but I speak English 99% of the time. I bought this book so I can brush up on my Cantonese. That is how I use the book. I don't know how any English speaker can learn from this book. The pronunciation keys are too hard to remember. It's is just because I know some Cantonese vocabulary that I can use it. For the words that I don't know I have a hard time of figuring out how it is supposed to be pronounced. I'll have to ask a relative or friend who is fluent in the language for the correct pronunciations. Cantonese is a very difficult language and a phrase book without any audio input is impossible. It would be great if Lonely Planet could come out with a Cantonese phrase book with an audio CD like they now have one for Mandarin."
4,Interesting Story,"I saw the movie based on this book when I was a kid. I enjoyed the movie, and was very glad to get the book. The story brings up many interesting issues with regards to people with disabilities, especially hysterically induced disabilities which may be spontaneously reversed at some point. The issues here include exploitation of the handicapped, how this affects the relationships between the disabled and their caretakers, and the psychology of the caretakers themselves. A very interesting study in dependency, charity, exploitation, and the relationships between caretakers and those taken care of."
5,Very Cute!!!,This is a gift for my 3 year old. She looks very cute galloping around as a unicorn and you can hear her coming. I also bought the dinosaur set for my 5 year old. Both are very excited and like to dress up all the time.
1,Four Words: Don't Buy This Book.,"I am an experienced web developer, and have signed up with Affiliate Networks some time ago. I thought I could gain more tips to improve my business by reading this book. I was fooled that a book with this sticker price was worth it.The first 100 pages discuss Excel, Word, Internet Explorer, search engines, ftp, and making a simple web page. The publisher should be ashamed to sell this book for more than $9.00. It has large print, and much useless ""bla bla bla...Do you know how to use Word, Excel, and FrontPage? Can you search the Internet for this keyword: ""Affiliate Programs"" then you are on your way. I am sending this book back to Amazon, it is a rip off, and feel very ripped off and violated. This book should be pulled from the market, or sold for $9.99.Where is the ZERO Star rating? I wish Amazon had it."
4,You'll know exactly what to do!,"Just how viable is using the internet to generate high income? After reading Rosalind Gardner's Super Affiliate Handbook you'll know. Everything is clearly laid out. Not only that. It's also very well structured! You can't get lost. She puts the emphasis where it ought to be: e.g. creating a fancy website is not. Every aspect is looked at in sufficient detail so that you can get going quickly. You see numerous recommendations and caveats. Where there is a multiple choice like different Affiliate Programs, not only do you get the links to check them out but you also get some guidance. Then she shows you the benefit of tools she's using herself. I especially like the fact that she doesn't cash in on them! I would have given it 5 stars if it had also laid out the time and money requirements until break even. Except for that Rosalind not only wants you to treat your internet business like business but she also treats her readers like businessmen. Great job well done!"
4,Is the book you need when you want to earn money online,"Rosalind Gradner has brought up very clear and step by step 'how to' in her book. It's a very good book if you want to seriously earn money from internet.In this book, you will find every step you need to do your anaylysis, research, and until your business is up and running.This book also contains a lot of usefull links that will save you so much times to find a perfect and trustworthy affiliates. So, you don't need to spend hours to find a right company.So, this book is recommended for those of you who want to be successful in internet marketing business."
3,"Works fine, removes with difficulty","This cable works fine and is of great quality, however, the jack has a unique molding and plastic piece that has made it difficult for me to remove, across the board. If you plan to install it and leave it, I can recommend it fully, but if you will use it to travel or it may need unplugged from time to time, try a different model with a different squeeze clip than this one has. I bought several lengths of this so please expect to see the same comments on all of the lengths I bought."
5,lifesaver,"This book is a must have for those of you entering or going through nursing school. It breaks everything down to a level that is understandable and the information is RETAINABLE. If you buy any book to supplement your school, this is the one. It saved my life on many tests!"
4,Joe Bender ROCKS!!!,"Joe Bender is a staple part of my language arts class year after year. Stuck to my whiteboard, he always brings out the creativity (and sense of humor) of even my most reluctant sixth graders. He does tend to break (I am now on my 5th Joe) after repeated bending - but even then my kids come up with all kinds of creative uses for him. (""Hospitalized Joe""...) A lot of fun!!!"
3,Storyline?,The storyline is ok-ok. The picture and filming in the location is classic and prioritizing to watch for the entertainment.
4,real good jam,Erykah Badu is a Artist that I enjoy her Singles more than her Albums.this Song was the one that got the Ball rolling for Her&I still enjoy the feel&vibe of this Song.nice groove&feel here.
5,All good,"As advertised...quickly delivered and they look the same ""in person"" as they do in the photo. Attractive and well-made."
3,Scattered plot,"I bought this dvd for two reasons; the media hype behind it and the fact that I am a fan of Dakota Fanning. The movie has it's good moments, but could definitely have used some help as much of the story was scattered."
2,It's a Living,It probably goes down as one of those memorable roles the actors would like to forget. It was slow moving and sort of on the boring side.But the actors did their best with a weak script. It was a paycheck for them.
2,YAAAWWN,"Dakota did well. The story was not too bad until... so as not to ""spoil"" I will just say, it was too much. The actors did a good job with the parts they had but it wasn't worth my time overall. I would have preferred to waste my time on something else."
2,Not enough tips,I was hoping to start teaching online groups and needed some practical tips to get me started. I estimated that I would need 183 practical tips before I could start. I knew 22 good tips already - 4 of those appeared in here so it was effectively 143 tips + 22 tips leaving me at 165 tips - 18 short of my target! If they write a book called '161 Practical Tips for Teaching Online Groups: Essentials of Web-Based Education' (with none I know already) then we might be talking. Verdict: short of the mark.
1,Wish I didn't buy,The book is quite general in its discussion of Agile and the case studies come off like the author's personal consulting experiences. One case study talks about how he was fired from a project for being too aggressive about sticking to the scrum. Not terribly useful.
4,Essential book for those who venture offshore,"I would give this book five stars except that it is a little out of date and not the easiest to read. Despite this, there is no question that the material within is critically important for any sailor who ventures offshore and worth reading. I feel this topic has not been adequately explored in the printed media. There are only three good books on the subject and this book leads the pack. There is still a lot of research to be done in area of heavy weather sailing. Coles does a good job explaining what to do in various situations he faced. This book gives you a chance to put yourself in his shoes. This book is well worth the price. It is cheap insurance considering that what you learn could save your life. Serious yachtsman read this book."
4,Great for your next road trip!,"I take many road trips with my six kids. We love to pile in the Suburban and head to parts unknown. This book outlines some great family friendly attractions, most relatively low priced. The one area I would have liked to see more detail was in the where to dine section. Overall, this book provided us with many attractions and ""tourist spots"" that we never would have found. I actually gave this book to my kids after I looked over it and they highlighted their choices. It was great fun!"
5,The best of Delois Barret Campbell and the Barrett Sisters.,"I had the orignal album back in the 70's and loaned it out, never to return. When I saw it on amazon.com I was glad. Listing to this CD album will take you back in the day when radio stations would play all the great gospel albums like Shirley Caesar, Caravans, James Cleveland, Delois Barrett Campbell and the Barrett Sisters and more. This is a must have in your gospel collection. When I saw them in the early 70's live in concert at a local church, they sound just like the album. I remember listing to the radio and God So Loved the World by the Barrett Sisters was playing, it caught my ear at a distance. You will be blessed by this album."
5,Bill accoumpanies with himself.,"This is a rare CD in which Bill Evans plays with himself. He plays three tracks and you hear three Bill Evans are accoumanying. One Bill Evans plays something and that improvises the other track of Bill Evans. This chain reaction creates a very different flavor than other CDs in which Bill accompanies with someone such as ""Under Current"" with Jim Hall. 'Click' 'click'"
4,Rockport,I like this product i have use this item and othersfrom this brand since more than 10 years ago.
4,Comfortable shoes,I wear wide shoes and the rockports fit good. I have a black pair and brown pair. I recommend these shoes for anyone that needs good comfortable walking shoes.
5,Great Comfort,Great comfortable shoe; stands up well in rough surfaces as well as just plain sidewalk walking. Meets all of my expectations with great heel support for a heel spur pain that I have.
4,he loved them,"I bought these for my boyfriend for work. He had rockports before and paid much more for them at retail price. He helped me find the ones he wanted, we lucked up and found them in his size. Which is sometimes hard when buying shoes on Amazon. When we seem the price we then questioned the authenticity of them. But the seller was Amazon, so it restored our faith. When we received them, he was nothing but happy and satisfied. Now he looks at my Amazon shopping addiction a little lighter. He now has me on the hunt for a brown pair."
5,Very Nice,"My husband has had a pair of these for a few years and it came time to replace. He did not want to try any other brand/type and just reordered the same type, he likes them a lot! He says they are very comfortable, almost as tennis shoes, but they look professional. Very quick shipment."
4,Fairly comfortable but??,"Overall, this shoe is very comfortable but it could usea little more arch support. In addition, I am not sure how Iwould have felt if I knew in advance that the shoes are made in Vietnam."
4,Rockport walking shoe,I originally bought Rockport from an outlet to see if paying a bit more would get me a shoe I liked better than 'tennis' shoes. I liked them and the two pair I bought through Amazon were my 3rd and 4th. I like them and the price was very right. My only problem is that I cannot find replacement liners which seem to be the only part of them that wears out.
4,Rockport Review,"I purchased these after wearing a similar style while on vacation about 18 months ago. Both pairs are very comfortable. They aren't what one would wear to ""dressy"" occasions, but the smooth finish on this pair makes it acceptable for most occasions."
5,Third pair.,This is the third pair of these shoes that I have owned.I wear these shoes as an everyday shoe and find them very comfortable. I walk aloton all kinds of surfaces and find that they give me great support.
5,WOW,"WOW,,,,where have I been? Fast, easy, and correct fit, size, and feel. I should have been ordering online a long time ago if I new it was this easy. Amazon has it all. Fast delivery and money back if not satisfied. Looking forward to my next purchase. Best regards; William leinthall"
5,My favorite...,"This is my fourth pair of these Rockport walking shoes over a number of years. I wear them daily, and when one pair wears out, I buy another. They are comfortable, lightweight, durable, and look good enough for work (business casual) or play.Finding shoes to fit has always been a problem for me, and even these need a little ""help,"" but because the inner sole is easily removable, I can slip additional padding beneath them to make the fit right for me.Price at Amazon was good, and shipping was fast. I'll buy these again, and will get them from Amazon."
3,returned it but fyi seems to run smaller than other shoes.,No impact either way but for comparison purposes. I got a 9.5 wide merrell and its perfect with the rockports need 10.5. and its still tight(width) at first but then good.
3,caution,"I was quite pleased when my shoes arrived, but horrified when trying to put them on. The shoes are well made, look good, exactly as advertised. But beware Amer/Can sizes!!! What I took as meaning normal, turns out to be NARROW fitting.[9 N,no good for bunions]Had planned follow up order of two more pairs but not confident enough now. International size converter makes it no clearer. Aust size 8-8.5 fits."
5,Rockport GREAT Walking shoes,"These are the best shoes i have ever had,Light on my foot and very comfort.Rockport Men's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe"
5,I love this cap,"I have had this for about a week now and love it, it keeps my head and ears so warm and there is enough material so i can pull it down around the back of my neck. I am a So.Cal cold weather sissy, and now i am working in the mountains of Afghanistan and it is getting cold!!!some reviewers said the cap is itchy, i haven't had that problem. I love this cap! i would recommend it to anyone."
1,crashes,i've gone through 2 of the 80 gb hard drives within a span of a month. the first harddrive wouldn't mount properly and the second one started out fine but then completely crashed. it's not very reliable or robust at all. if you don't ever need to travel and don't need to move the harddrive it's fine. but it just crashes too often and it's not recoverable.
5,not stuiped,hi i think this model is very nice i don't have her yet i do not see anything worng whit wixom i have been colleting for only 3 mhounts spelling erro srry and i have more thane 40 models i have a huge mustang herd im 10 going to be 11 none of my models have chips paint summges or rugs only my clsydale foal from falling off top of my bunk bed on ears and not broken very durbel seppling eroo agane srry on to my other bed
3,"Not a Substitute For the Book, But Still Worth Watching","For those of you who read my review on the book, you know that I gave it 4 stars. This is not a substitue for the book. Important characters like Rose Maylie and Monks are deleted; significant information is left out; and some important events are dropped. But if you have already read the book and don't mind some alterations, this is a delightful video. The songs and dances are well done and carry a real charm. In some cases they make the events more memorable. (Like when the Dodger finds Fagin and gives him what little money he has.) Several characters carry more flair in the book. But major characters like the Dodger, Fagin, and Bill Sikes are quite well done. I did not mind the fact that Fagin and the Dodger were spared their tragic fate in the book. This is a well done musical, and it is worth watching. But if you are looking for what Dickens wrote, you may be disappointed."
5,Oliver!,"This video is a treasure for me because it can bring back my childhood memory. I watched this film since I was 6 or 7. The songs and the scenes are valuable because you cannot find all these original form in other way except this video. The pictures are all clear and sharp. If you like musicals, dance, songs with story, it is a very good taste for you. I highly recommend it for you!!It is a great movie. Excellent!!Excellent!!Excellent!! Excellent........."
2,"Same Disc, Different Package","This movie is excellent and deserves five stars but this release on DVD has the same problem as the first release, and because I've bought both from this studio I feel I have a right to complain. This is a long movie and Columbia has twice now saw fit to place the first half up to the Intermission on one side and the second half on the other side. Flipping a disc is something I haven't had to do since LP's vanished."
2,Oliver,"The movie is great - a classic I grew up with, however, the one I purchased was missing the first half of the movie. The CD was a copy and started with the intermission of the second half. I sent back to the distributor - waisting more money with hopes that a new and complete movie will come back to me. My son was so excited to see the movie so we were all dissapointed that it was a defective DVD."
1,Oliver,Had a crack in disc when it arrived. I was disappointed I couldn't watch it and it wasn't worth the aggravation of trying to replace it.
3,Just okay...,"Maybe I should have started with the '48 version first. I liked Moody's Fagin. He really got into the character. I enjoyed the colorful sets and few of the songs, but I never connected to Lester's Oliver. I didn't like the whole domestic violence angle and the killing. Definitely NOT something I think young children should watch. Jack Wild's Dodger was adorable, but for the most part, I did a lot fidgeting in my seat, wanting the movie to end. I'll probably check out the other version later. This production is just okay."
5,Great classic movie.,"Great classic movie. The disc is a 2-sided disk and the second side has the old-style intermission before the second half of the movie starts (but you can fast forward or skip it). If you like musicals, this is a great movie to add to your collection. My kids liked it too!"
1,Only 1/2 the movie,"I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas and when she finally decided to watch it we discovered that only the 2nd half of the movie was on the DVD. Very disappointing. Unfortunately, because she hadn't tried to watch it before now it is too late to get a full refund and we would have to pay for the shipping."
5,Shark Week all year long,"I quickly recognised these dvd's as episodes of the Discovery Channel's Shark Week collection. I was impressed with the transfer and they are remastered! The only episode that had old video was the first one, Operation Shark Attack about Ron and Val Taylor testing a mesh shark suit. There are two pieces of trivia about sharks and five multiple choice questions (good for kids)on each dvd. I think this is a great value will provide enjoyment for both parents and children."
3,description,Volume four of a series that looks at shark behaviour including real-life shark-attack stories.
4,Fascinating Concept,"A fun reading and fascinating concept. John Birmingham hasn't disappointed again in this my second book under his authorship. The battle descriptions while enjoyable (read like a Clancy Novel) were a little long in some areas (like the first 100 pages), but the anachronistic interactions between the time travelers and residents of 1942 were not only entertaining and fascinating. The happenings and ideas from the plot line seemed very plausible and the hint of future plot directions make me excited about reading the next in this trilogy."
2,Not any better the second time around,"I read this book when it first came out, then forgot I'd done so. Saw a copy in the bookstore recently and bought it. Oops. I think one of the jacket blurbs describes the novel as Clancyesque, and it sure is, in all the worst ways- the uber-bitchy female reporters, the loving descriptions of weapons, and the colorfully named and one-dimensional military heroes. The author, an Aussie, appears to have little familiarity with how actual Americans talk. He also has issues with the Japanese- they're generally portrayed as inhuman fanatics, and the 21st-century characters are calling them ""Japs"" almost as soon as they arrive in 1942. Bottom line- if you like Clancy, Thor, etc. then go for it."
3,I'ts like the Curates Egg - Good in Parts,"There is enough in the book to keep you interested, and turning the page. The idea is intriguing, but it is Science fiction after all. Without rehashing the content of other reviews here I found the Idea of the culture shock Ok but totally overblown. The concept of being able to accelerate the development of technology given information from the future is an intriguing one. Also the idea of the fact that by changing the past the strategic knowledge that you brought with you from the future would become useless pretty quickly. The political aspects of the novel are less satisfactory. But I will follo through on the trilogy to see how it pans out"
2,Weapons of Choice,"Having read John Birminghams Without Warning and After America,I am totally disallusioned on reading Weapons of Choice. Just couldn't connect with it, it seems so scrabbled and hard to follow each minute of each ship in of all times, 1942. I found this book impossibleto get involved in and finally abandoned it all together. Most likely will not complete the trilogy, after spending my hard earned bux to find all three. Alas...."
3,often overlooked,"While i have not read this book I could not help but write this anyway ..The assumption in official circles is that the US and its foreign policy has been to build freedom and democracy around the world.This is patently false and many of the worlds dictators are American corporate puppets propped up by the CIA.The US is responsible for much of the tyranny in the world because this is its true goal.Look at Central and South America ""Americas Backyard"" where the CIA and its policies have run free and it is still a mess after over 100 years of US intervention.The first Axis of Evil is the US and its Intelligence ,Law enforcement agenda.Read ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman""for a reality check."
2,NOT strictly a jump rope book,"I think the title ""Getting a Jump on Fitness"" and the back cover summary are both misleading.This book is 155 pages long, containing approximately 170 photos on fitness exercises. Of the 170 photos, approximately 30 are about rope jumping.I am new to rope jumping for fitness, and was looking for steps, techniques, and rope jumping fitness routines. I didn't find what I was looking for in this book (as I did with ""Jumping Rope the Second Time Around"" by Carlos Coffman).If you are looking for a book on fitness exercises which INCLUDE rope jumping, you may find this a useful book. If you are looking for a book ONLY about rope jumping, I cannot recommend this purchase."
1,Horrible. Stay Away,"I have had nothing but problems with Vaio laptops. The DVD cannot read half the discs that I put in it. The audio doesn't work. There are all kinds of preinstalled programs on here that i can't uninstall. To boot, the customer service is terrible. I never had these problem by IBM."
2,drift boat,"Interesting book with nice pictures. I think a better title might be ""The Complete History of Drift Boats"". I purchased the book looking for information to make a more informed decision when buying a drift boat, did not really find it very useful for this purpose."
4,A short novel of the Korean War,"A good but very short novel about the Korean War that was written in 1953. Although short, the novel touches on many issues, the dangers faced by bomber pilots and their courage, the political reasons why were fighting in Korean, the unfairness to those who were chosen to fight, and the ignorance of the American public about the ongoing war."
2,Its ok but only when you get up to page 60,I had to read this book for history and it's ok I think that Mike Foreney was the greatest character because he was the most interesting. Nestor saved a man from a crash. and Beer Barrel was a drunk who snuck beer on board in a golf bag. What else do you need to say?
4,A Must Read for All Boys,"This book is a definite page-turner and can easily be finished in one sitting. That being said, it is a fine reflection of emotional conflict that comes with being in a war. More than that, it is a book about loyalty and friendship that I think any young boy can benefit from reading. A classic."
1,Reality-Check on the Scary-Book,"A senior developer friend of mine recommended this book to me.I wish he hadn't.This is the sort of book that anyone with half a mind could throw together. It cannot be called a parody, as it doesn't go all out (the basic key descriptions of Java and how it works is correct). You can't call it an informative read, as lay readers will accept the key information about java, and may very well take on onboard some of the dangerous, absurdist concepts that the author, CE3, introduces around the basic concepts.It's not a book for the novice who wanted a humourous, informative introduction to Java, and certainly not a book for a Java developer who wanted to laugh at the profession.A travesty of a book. Avoid."
1,Beyond disappointing,"I was lulled in to a false sense of security with this opening with a long spoken word piece. A brave move to say the least. However from then on it's all down hill. To stay that this is a major let down after their two previous brilliant albums is a complete understatement. It's hard to know just what they were trying to achieve with this album (commercial sucess i suppose), the result however is truly dire. Everything that previously made Blumfeld's sound unique is buried beneath wash of synths that would have sounded more at home on a Phil Collins album.The songs sound regardless of the language barrier like any pap being pumped out of FM radio anywhere in the world. There's no spark no energy, nothing.Both L'etat et Moi and the debut Ich Machine are fantastically tuneful and unigue slices of Indy rock. With Old Nobody Blumfled completely lost the plot.Avoid!!"
1,Don't Buy This!!!!!,It looked good online but when we received it - it looked like a piece of cheesecloth stuffed with cotton that has been twisted and contorted in the shape of a head and body. When I removed the tag - all of the cotton stuffing came out of her wrist. This item is so cheap and not worth even 1.00. It is really the worst buy I have ever made.
4,Smooth,"Got a Oppo universal player. Started reading about super audio CDs, and it was intriguing. If you happen to be looking for a full catalog of SACDs check out sa-cd.netThis disc was highly recommended. At such a cheap price compared to many titles out on the market, it was easy to pull the trigger, and give it a listen. Verdict, that was $13 dollars well spent! This sounds fantastic. The music is smooth, and very relaxing. Definitely will be looking for some more Getz Gilberto and jazz releases. I remember as a kid hearing the song The Girl from Ipanema. Never knew the title or the artist, as a kid you don't really pay attention to such things. But when it started playing, that just brought a grin to my face.Only reason for not giving 5 stars, this is SACD only; it will not play in a normal CD player. Their is a hybrid version of this disc, but it is silly expensive ($100+)."
4,Communication Principles for lifetime 4th edition,"This book took me by surprise. I was expecting a boring semester,however I have learned so much, I am a better communicator specially with my husband and kids, and ofcouse my co-workers. i love, love, love this book."
4,Good!,"The product was just as described. There was marking inside, which I did expect, and it was helpful for me to study. I will recommend that you get this used book, as it saves you money. I got the product after about 2 or 3 days. Maybe its because it was shipped from the state I lived in. Anyways! I'm pretty happy."
5,just right,"This one, IMO, was just right.There's nice characterization, and it's a light, quick read.We do see shades of Cybil's parents' romance, but not as exaggerated. In fact, Cybil realizes at one point that Preston reminds her of her father, which is a nice bit of characterization there--women do frequently fall in love with men who remind them of their fathers."
2,The Perfect Neighbor,"I tried to like this book, based on the reviews. But Cybil got on my nerves...She was so annoying, no wonder Preston didn't like her at first. Frankly I thought he was better off ignoring her. Her blindingly bright manners made her unlikable, and she was such a drama queen. NOT the perfect neighbor. More like one of those neighbors who are friendly to the point of being irritating.I wanted to like this story, really, but her emotions kept changing so much that no wonder Preston got frustrated."
3,Beautiful,"I enjoyed this book because it is a wonderful romance story. Although it does not have a plot to figure out or a mystery, the sweetness and love pull you in."
3,Good But Not for Gil Evans Completists,"This is good guitar jazz. Not as soulful as Grant Green but still well done. This is probably Kenny Burrell's best album. However, there is one big if. If you are a Gil Evan's completist as I am, then realize he only accompanies a few of the tracks as is more in the background than the foreground. Therefore, though Gil Evans accompianiment is effective it is foreshadowed by the playing of Kenny Burrell."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this lamp, but it was disappointing - it does not look as sophisticated as it does on the photo and it heats up very fast too (with a 60W bulb). Sent it back."
5,Mind Numbingly Good,"These guys are so very very heavy. They have a massive amount of good ideas and string them together beautifully. The sound is psychedelic with influeces from Zeppelin, Queen, Cream and all good things from the 1970's.This truly is a power trio with lots of heavy guitar and Bohnam-esque power drumming. Some of the songs are softer with harmonies that remind me of The Jelly Fish.If you like heavy/psychedelic music with great arrangments and a million good ideas, then check this out. Other groups I recommend checking out: The Go, Wolfmother, the Jellyfish, and The Paybacks. And check out the Vines ""Winning Days"" - the best album of the last 25 years IMHO."
2,"very large, very stinky","it's huge, which isn't a bad thing, but so smelly i don't even want to use it. the smell gets on everything it touches. you can smell it on your hands, even after washing your hands."
3,Well....,"It's ok, but way too big for me. My boyfriend bought this for me recently but not from Amazon. It is difficult to go in even slathered in lubricant, kinda hurts, has a strong rubbery smell, and I have the undying phobia that it will somehow ""stretch me out"", i know it probably won't but it's my paranoia..Overall, tears easy... too big, too pink."
4,"Nice, but too big.","This would be so much nicer for me if it was smaller! I'm not a petite little thing either - I'm 5'8"" but this was huge. I've thought bigger was better, but I learned it the hard way that's not always the case. Ouchie.It actually smelled good, contrary to previous reviews (maybe they changed up the smell) - lightly scented with something...I'm bummed this was too big for me, but it would be great for ladies (or gentlemen) who can handle bigger widths. It was about 5.3"" at the head and 5"" at the shaft."
2,Nice but very fragile,"After doing quite a bit of research I purchased this headset for its long battery life. It was confortable to wear but the microphone stopped working after about 6 weeks use. Called into Logitech and found out that the microphone can easily be roatate a full 360 degrees. When it does it damages the the micophone (thus why it stopped working). Don't have any idea when or how that happened. And of course there is no warranty coverage. So I have a head set that can't be repaired nor used. If you are super careful this might work for you, but I need something more durable. I'll be shopping for another model."
5,Possibly the best Benny Carter recording,"This CD contains trios, quartets, and quintets -- all featuring Benny Carter, and composed in various combinations with these outstanding musicians:Teddy Wilson, Jo Jones, Don Abney, George Duviver, Louie Bellson, Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis, Ray Brown, and Bobby White.There are 19 tracks for a total playing time of 76 minutes. Every track is just perfect.O.K., if one CD of this isn't enough for you, then also consider Benny Carter ""The King"" and Art Tatum ""The Complete Pablo Group Masterpieces"", both from Pablo Records. Each of these recordings has a different set of musicians. My own opinion is that for Benny Carter, this (3,4,5 Sessions) is the ideal combination."
2,Home movie,"Did you ever watch someone else's home movies and feel like you were missing out on the fun? This is pretty much how I felt watching ""Poopie."" I knew SOMETHING was funny, because everyone on screen was laughing, but I just wasn't in on the joke. I think it's great the MST3K folks had fun while making the show, but as far as Poopie's proffered zany antics go, I think you just had to be there.Don't get me wrong - I enjoy MST3K a lot and was very much looking forward to the outtakes. Unfortunately, Poopie didn't live up to my expectations; it was too short, and most of the clips selected simply weren't ""stand alone funny."" They dared to ask the question ""how many times can someone giggling as he goofs a line be funny,"" and now we know, it's definitely some number less than the number of times it happens in this short production."
5,Nostalgic listening for the holidays,"Having heard this playing at a restaurant over the Christmas holidays, I bought it immediately. It makes for lovely background, easy listening music arousing nostalgic memories of the Christmas holidays. On a technical note, David Osborne's piano playing is impeccable, very crisp and clear. This CD is a keeper for every Christmas holiday to come. It makes a nice addition to my CD holiday listening music collection of Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby."
5,Another great CD,All of the songs on this cd are exactly what I was looking for. It brings back great memories of great songs and great stories
5,Son loved the product,Good product. Son put it together in one night and was fascinated by the electonics.
4,Good short mystery stories once you get past the stiff British characters,"While Agatha Christie is an excellent writer of mystery stories, one has to digest them within the context of the English society she was a part of. The characters are very British in dress and demeanor, which can have an adverse affect on your enjoyment of the story. At times, the characters are stiff and a little too proper, which does at time seem quaint.Nevertheless, the 13 stories are still fun to read and ponder. Four of them feature Hercule Poirot, three star Miss Marple, two have the talents Harley Quin, two showcase personal consultant Mr. Parker Pyne, one utilizes the intellect of Tommy and Tuppence and a last one describes the demise of the great Inspector Evans. Short and generally to the point, each of the stories in this collection is an excellent selection for reading at night before the lights go out."
5,Simply SUPERB!!!,"Excellent movie... I was just spellbound while watching this movie at my friend's place and bought one for myself. I am not a great movie buff, but this is an excellent masterpiece. I do agree that there should have been a Hindi track for Indian viewers too considering it was made in both languages at a time. Also as the other reviewer has pointed out, there should have been a bit about the lead Indian actors in that movie. It is strange that none of them are highlighted here. Most of the western audience would know more about their actors and their achievements... It would have made more sense to highlight some of the achievements of the actors from this part of the world too. Go own it and u'll never regret it."
5,Awesome,"The movie depicts reality quite well. There is a misconception that Ben Kingsley is a British actor. He is an Indian, his real name being Krishna Bhanji, and has merely Anglicized his name. Inspite being too long, the movie holds your attention. Those wishing to see more of the Mahatma see the movies - ""Making of the Mahatma"" - where he is depicted more as a human, than as a saint and also the movie ""Sardar"" , about Vallabh Patel."
5,Gandhi,This movie had terrific acting and a wonderful plot. I am writing a review for my world religion class so be forewarned that I will include some plot details.
5,Awesome teaching tool,"I use this to teach civil disobedience and the importance of Gandhi because it is part of our 7th grade curriculum. It is such a good movie. It is one of my favorite things to teach each year because the movie was made so well, shows so many important events throughout Gandhi's life, and the kids always love it. I recommend watching it for pleasure as well."
1,A total waste of time and money - Its a movie full of lies,I watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies. He did his best not to divide India and it was all Jinnah who divided and founded Pakistan. Gandhi was totally against it.In short - Wasted my money. I would rather be watching a silly comedy show. That must have been atleast better than this movie.
4,Stan Getz personal favorite recording,"Eddie Sauter's big band plays original jazz tunes from written score and Stan Getz improvizes lyric melodies. Very moving, especially ""Her"" written for his recently deceased mother. Ballads, Bebop, Big band, and Romantic Orchestral.This was Getz personal favorite of all of his recordings, when he got the Grammy for ""Getz/Gilberto"", he said he should have gotten it for ""FOCUS""!Verve 20bit has best sound."
1,A boring movie score...,I bought Focus (fortunately used) based on the five star reviews here. I am very disappointed in it. Lousy elevator music? Tedious mall music? A bad movie score? Getz's jazz is much more powerful and musically appealling than this. Don't bother.
5,Comprehensive and accessible,"This is a highly sophisticated technical manual for engineers, contractors, and students in the timber framing industry. It is NOT for the person who is building a shed in his backyard and looking for a how-to book.This text is well written with an accessible style you rarely find in highly technical material. It covers both sawn lumber and structural glued laminated timber and provides up-to-date technical data and recommendations on engineered timber construction with essential knowledge of wood and its application to specific design considerations.Highly recommended."
1,"TIRED BRASS, NOTHING GOLDEN HERE","Standard formulaic V. C. Andrews/Ghostwritten fair. A pretty young girl, sexual trauma in her background and a seducer. Gabrielle (called Gabriel for some unknown reason) is seduced by a wealthy cannery owner and gives birth to a son named Paul who will later unknowingly fall in love with his half-sister, Ruby.It's just another tired fraternal incest installment and twins are part of the Landry series as well. It's just more of the same old story. Tired fare."
5,I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was SOOO good!! I couldn't believe that Glady's Tate was pretending that she was going to have a baby! I t was so funny when Gabriel was in labor and Gladys was screaming louder than the real person in pain!! If I were Gabriel I would have never, ever given up my kid for someone like her!!This is one of the best books I've EVER read!! When I read this I just couldn't put it down!! If I left the book in my locker in school, I would race back to school just to get it!!!! I'd really recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet!!!"
4,5th book in the series but should be 1st...,"This is the 5th V.C. Andrews series that I've read & I need to start taking my own advice and read the 5th book in the series before I read the others. The 5th book is always the actual beginning of the series & I have no clue why it's like that. You already know everything that happens so I can never make myself finish the last book because there are other books that I'd rather be reading. I'm sure if I had read this book first I would've really enjoyed it but I just see no reason to read a book where you already no everything that happens. Overall though, this is my least favorite V.C. Andrews's series. It was just o.k. for me. Nothing special."
5,Fast shipping!,Product came in just a few days. It was perfect for our vacuum cleaner and less expensive than on the Hoover website.
3,Is it worth it?,"This book contains some great photos of freaks but the writing is definitely not what I expected. It is mostly accounts of freaks who served in courts as jesters and other jobs. Yet, all the photos are of sideshow freaks from the late 1800's and early 1900's. I had assumed that the writing would be about the performers shown but most were not even mentioned. All in all, I did not like the way that the book was put together and wish I had not spent the money on it. For some though, the photos are worth the price of the book."
5,Gripping,The auther put thought into the characters and the Ice Creepers. Most of this book is placed in the mountains near the city of Rin. The characters were well written u really got a feel for the characters. Rowan of the Bukshaw its definitely well put in this story his journey you really get the feeling that you are in the story feeling his pain. Feel his love for his friends and the hate for the Ice Creepers.personally this book was great and its the best book that i've read in a while. this book i could read it over and over and still be interested.
1,More fun looking at the box,"My 7 year old daughter received this as a gift. Unfortunately after trying to put it together, the handle kept coming off and the shaved ice melted before a full small cup could be filled. You will expend more energy than it is worth. I don't suggest buying this toy. I gave the toy a 2 star educational value since you can discuss how sno-cone makers work by showing your child each component of the toy."
2,Not really for commercial use,"When I received the SpongeBob Squarepants Sno-Cone Maker for my last birthday, I was pretty excited, because not only was I going to get to enjoy unlimited snow cones whenever I chose to, I also was going to get to earn a little side money by opening up my own snow cone stand.Things went well at first; since I opened in February, the traffic was light and I was able to meet the demands of the thirsty public. However, as the weather heated up, the flaws in the SpongeBob Sno-Cone Maker's design began to be more evident - the endless cranking required to produce just one snow cone means that it's very hard work to satisfy a long line of shaved-ice seekers. By mid-July, I was forced to close down the stand, with low profits and a hefty case of carpal tunnel syndrome.But while I might have gone too far, I can't say anything bad about the product. Except for that crank. Oh, and I don't like SpongeBob."
1,Too Much $ Too Much Work,My 3 kids like playing with this however it is too much work for parents. My 12 year old can't even work it. By the time I finish making a cup of this stuff the rest are complaining it is taking too long for them to get a cup. Not to mention it takes alot of elbow grease to even work it. I would rather take them to the 7-11 to get a slushie or crush up ice in the blender. I suggest this item only if you NEED an upper body work out and headaches from your kids.
2,Gipped,I was disappointed with the person who sold this product. The box clearly states there were six pieces but i only received 5.
3,No Snowman,"I got only 5 rosettes instead of 6. The snowman was missing. Sorry, Amazon, but I'm returning your merchandise. 5 rosettes aren't the same as six."
5,Good Dog!,"Tired of the same old generic pop music? It's time to turn off your radio and turn on Bad Dog No Biscuit. This clever 7-piece band mixes jazz, R&B, and a lot of heart & soul to create a unique sound worth repeat listening. The 12 tracks were written by band members who (gasp!) actually play their own instruments. A true original! Check out the first track, ""My Best Friend,"" and don't stop there. Each song on 'Living in Dog Years' will warm your heart and get you on the dance floor. Bad Dog No Biscuit plays frequently on the L.A. club circuit, so check them out if you have the chance. I'd give this Bad Dog a biscuit any day!"
3,Ok Filter,"Filter does its job. easy to connect with 1/4"" plastic line. Water still has a slight taste of chlorine, but it is definitely reduced."
5,excellent filter,this filter has been improved so that it is much easier to install and works well for at least the 12 months before we need to change it. Makes purer tasting water than any bottled water could wish for!
4,They feel so good,"These Sunbeam pads only last 5 years or so, but I buy them anyway because they feel sooooo good. I just wish they lasted longer. The coils stop working one at a time until it is obvious you need to buy a new one."
4,Sunbean heated mattress pad,"I love having a heated mattress pad on my new Cal king bed. I have had others in the past and really likethe Sunbeam one because my bed warms up quickly and has many more heating levels than the ones I previously had. I did find it a little strange to have a pre- heat option, but it really helps warm up the bed."
1,DON'T BUY!! Sunbeam seems to have lost their way,"After about 3 weeks of use, my wife's side controller started to flash the dreaded ""FF"" on her digital controller. I followed all of the manufactures suggestions to no avail. Now I have to pay to ship it back to them, with a 3 to 4 week wait time. This is the 2nd one that has gone out. I am beginning to think there is a quality control issue as the FF seems to be such an issue that it's on their website. I have purchased 100's of items on here, and this is the first regretful purchase I have made.I DO NOT recommend that you purchase their products. I would refer you to the consumers website where you can query yourself."
5,Educational and beautiful Biblical fiction,"I finished Angela Hunt's biblical fiction The Shadow Women which recounts the lives of the women surrounding the life of Moses: Pharaoh's daughter, Miryam, and Zipporah. Hunt's strict adherence to Scripture and attention to detail made me truly understand some characters I had been unable to before. Now as I read through the actual passages, I find myself able to visualize events more clearly and with greater understanding. I'm able to connect with the stories more. The Shadow Women is a great piece of Biblical fiction and shouldn't be passed up"
1,Bird Brain,"From Publishers Weekly: "" . . . Siegel contends, a new bird flu pandemic would face effective public health measures and medical treatments"".YIKES!!!The U.S. has enough Tamiflu for under 5% of it citizens IF it is even effective for the strain that could mutate to allow Human to Human (H2H) transmission. Our hospitals have less than 2% capicity available on average and the normal flu season often strains the system. . .This book produces more hot air than the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta."
1,"Ridiculous, but hardly sublime","Probably the most hilarious interpretation of David Lynch ever written, and I'm pretty interested in wondering how Lynch himself would feel if he noticed that his art has been hijacked by the post-modern academic elite. Actually, Martha Notchimson's ""Passion of David Lynch"" probably got Lynch down better than any of his critics, but to reduce her interpretations to New Agism is really just an exemplification of fringe criticism's dread of Jungian thought in the first place - not that Lynch is a Jungian, but he is all about transcendental meditation and reincarnation, and his pictures seem to have a similar spiritual center and energy. Zizek is extremely intelligent, but ultimately he's fishing for minnows while sitting on a whale. If you interpret Lynch in regards to a system (Lacanian for instance) instead of humanity, you end up with what Lynch would probably call ""phoney baloney""."
3,Intelligent but cockeyed,"This is my first exposure to the work of Slavoj Zizek, but it probably will not be my last. Undeniably studied, Zizek is able to write with an unusual fusion of irreverent pop-cultural wit and stuffy intellectual jargon. That makes this breezy (43 page) study easy to read and profoundly deep at the same time. But don't mistake ""profoundly deep"" for ""profoundly revealing"" or ""profoundly correct"", as it is none of the above.A self-proclaimed Lacanian, Zizek makes a case for an anti-Fruedian, anti-Jungian psychoanalytic interpretation of what is perhaps David Lynch's most obscure feature film since Eraserhead. As published on Amazon.com and elsewhere, I prefer a Jungian interpretation of Lost Highway, and for good reason: it fits extremely well. To deny this is to deny the evidence of one's own eyes.All the same, Zizek's intellect is beyond dispute, and his reading of Lost Highway should be of great interest to film theorists and serious David Lynch fans alike."
1,Multimedia for Learning,Dense and confusing text. Made learning multimedia a chore rather than interesting. Gave up reading it for class halfway through and it didn't affect me.
2,there can be only one.,"I remember buying Gangsta Pat's ""#1 Suspect""on vinyl back in 1991 That record clicked and kicked on every song. I rate ""#1 Suspect"" at a very high '5'stars. I heard this cd <all about comin'up> and it's not all good. could g_Pat just be a ""One Album Wonder""? I think so."
2,Really confusing story,"I had always wanted to read this book, when I did I was very disappointed. I thought that the book was very confusing and I couldn't sit down very long reading this book before falling asleep, even if it was in the middle of the day. Lara made me sick, I couldn't stand her. I felt sorry for the entire Zhivago family. There were a few parts in the book that were good, but not many. If you want to have a good nap in the middle of the day read this book."
1,See the movie instead; Pasternak's no Tolstoy!,"Absolutely terrible. He should have stuck to writing poetry. If you're interested in the story, see the movie: it's true to the book but is actually organized and coherent."
3,Great book ...small print,"This is a great read! Too bad, the print was so small I had to use a magnifier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best metalcore CD ever made!!!!,"I listen to ALOT of metal, but this CD is by far the best I own. As The Palaces Burn is excellent, but this bypasses it no question. Randy Blythe has the most sick and crazy vocals ever for a metal band. I just can't believe how amazing this Cd and this band is. Every song is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. There's plently of rythem shifts and the drumming is amazing. The song structures are very complex. No riffs that repeat over and over. The best songs are Black Label, Letter to the Unborn , In the Absence of the Sacred, and Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion. This Cd is a MUST HAVE if you love metal and heavy music."
2,Overrated,"I listen to all types of music, but specialize in metal. So when I kept reading about Lamb of God, I thought it would be good. Everything on here sounds the same. The vocals are horrible, and in several of the songs they don't even say most of the lyrics. The guitar sounds like the same riffs every song. This and Slipknot are two of the most popular bands around, but they both suck. So my question is, ""when did people get so stupid""?"
5,Renaming.,"This album as a whole, is sick! from 1 - 10. LOG, brings what metal needs to be today. After changing the name of the band and the release of this album, people were blown off their gord! There sound did change over the 15 years but, I can tell you one thing. If they slowed down, atleast they have instramentals, without any part of thier music being sung. And that is what separates Lamb of God, from everyone else. They do something different every album but they dont try to out do themselves in the studio, they do it on stage. That's what makes a metal band metal... when you can do it on stage harder."
3,Reality TV women: they're unreal,"Being a playboy product, you know the images will be clear and well focused, the models beautiful, and the sets adequate if not ravishing. What you can also predict is that the film will have a detached air about it that precludes the viewer from feeling any emotion ties to the on screen action, so that you see basically a slide show of pretty pictures and nothing more."
3,boo-yah!,"This is a good dvd, the scene that steals the cake is the jessica drake scene (on the cover). Although it is quite short, you can tell how realistic the sex is when she is up against the fence.... she is quite hot indeed!"
5,LOVE this book for my 5 year old,LOVE this book for my 5 year old. He took out this book at the library so many times I finally bought him his own copy. Now I buy it for all my friends kids for birthday gifts. The story is very cute and told in a very harmonious rhyme. Illustrations are big and colorful. Good for ages 3 and up and will part of your library for a while.
5,Metal Music for MetalHeads,"I got this cd during a search for new Metal Bands. I had never heard of any of there songs so was taking a chance. I am so glad I got this cd!!An earlier Iced Earth feel at times, 80's metal at moments and more modern metal at others. Vocalist voice fits perfectly with the music.I hate these girly high pitched sounding metal singers, its become a joke, well this guy has a Metal voice that is listenable without being annoying!!Love to get the RED demo but am not sure where to look for it. I know its not out on cd so gonna have to be content with a casstte.Not sure thou if the band is still together? Hope so loved to hear another release from them!!!"
5,"Over and Under as well as ""Leaving the Bench""",This was an approach studying indivdual justices rather than cases in describing the Supreme Court. Would highly recommend social science instructors use the material when discussing the workings of the Court. Would like to have seen more information on the problems and contributions of the many law clerks who are essential to the operation of the Court.
5,Keeps me warm,My everyday hat for a 2.5 mile walk to work in Boston this winter. Really love the fact that I can bring the sides down as far as I want to cover my ears as it gets colder.
3,Too snug for me...,...so I gave it to a young boy. He likes it well enough to keep it else I would have returned it.
3,"Bad taste, good product","Bad taste, but great product because of the High SPF which is hard to find in a lip balm.If only they could fix that chemical taste!"
5,Best Edition Ever!,"""Songs from the Big Chair"" remains one of my top-5 albums from the 80s of all time. And this edition is a MUST-HAVE, as it has all the singles and remixes and album versions of all their big hits... ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", ""Shout"", ""Head Over Heels"" and ""Mothers Talk"", all of which still sound fresh today, a couple of decades laters. Though the other tracks on the album, including the b-sides, are a bit dated to say the least, this edition is worth it just to have all those various mixes of the singles, some of which are available for the first time ever on CD."
4,songs from the big chair / used CD from fsabella,I was very satisfied with the transaction and quality of the CD.
4,YEAH!!!! MONEY!!!!!,Ok this item ROCKS!!!! If you have collected the other coins (From the past. They don't sell them anymore) then once they stop giving these out SELL IT!!!!! Trust me money flows right into your arms!!! You will only get a ton money if you have all of them. So if you do not have all of them don't count on so much money as you could get.
4,Ringo Lam and Sammo Hung make a winning combination,"Also known as Touch and Go... wow, this was great. I didn't even know of its existence until a few weeks ago and bought it immediately. Ringo Lam is known for making pretty brutal action movies, perhaps best illustrated by Full Contact, which he made one year later and has been one of my five favorite movies from anyone ever for 10 years. But, in this one he worked with Sammo Hung! A true master of the action-comedy genre, it was great to see Sammo in a Ringo Lam film. A lot of great action and just a great looking dark movie.The dvd was pretty simple but actually pretty nice. Widescreen but not anamorphic. English subtitles worked great, and the occasional hilarious typo is all part of the fun. One trailer on the disk, for the film."
3,Not for iPhone,"This dock is not made for the iPhone. The remote does not work with the iPhone, and the iPhone sits in the dock in such a way that the main button is nearly inaccessible."
4,A well written and thought out book,"If you are looking for a book that is very descript about the American Bulldog, then The Working American Bulldog book is the one to get. Currently this book is the most acurate and informative book out about this breed. Dave Putnam's dedication and work shows well as he tries and successfully covers most all aspects of the breed right down to known breeders."
3,Interesting,The movie kept me interested. I sat down throughout the whole movie even though I was disappointed in the plot of the movie. I expected it to be different. The fact that Ned found Rachel attractive did not surprise me or come off as being far fetch. But there were some disturbing scenes in the movie. And at the same time there were some brief happy scenes. The ending was sad but I guess more believable. And the acting was about average and could have been a little better. But overall it was entertaining.
4,Instant comfort,"Love braided rugs! They add instant comfort and charm to any room, like a dog curled up in front of a fireplace. This rug is holding up well with 3 dogs, and lots of foot traffic through the living room (hasn't been quite a year). With a nonslip pad underneath it doesn't slide at all. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the colors are not as bright in person as they are in the picture (tan, not yellow. maroon, not red). Even though I was looking forward to brighter tones, it still looked good with the wall color of the room, and for the price I couldn't beat it!"
4,Users' Guide: relaxing and moderately entertaining read,"The text is written in a pleasant format punctuated with relevant comments. The topic is Windows 98 from an end-user view point: it is a cross between ""Popular Computing"" and Cisco & Ebert. Even the frequent characterizations of Bill Gates (""Billie"") and the two short, heavy-set guys (Leonhard & Simon) are tasteful and instructive.If you want to learn about using Microsoft Windows 98 with some good inside tricks, this text is a good beginning.If you want to know the API function calls to write programs for Windows 98, you won't find what you need here. In fact, the book reads so nicely that you will probably need to fight to keep focused on your work, instead of propping your feet up on your desk and enjoying this light read."
3,Only good if you like covers,"The music is pretty good, but these are all covers by faceless session vocalists. If you want the orginal hits you hear on the radio or the danceclub, boys, keep looking. The main lure is hot cover boy."
4,Lovely scent!,"Petale is a soft feminine fragrance, I put in my bathroom and it leaves a lovely scent! You can't go wrong with Archipelago...the scents are wonderful, another great one is Luna!!"
1,Hollow inside,"I was expecting a firm backrest, except it is soft and hollow on the inside; therefore it does not provide any support at all. It feels like you are leaning into a piece of cloth."
4,It is so perfect....,This CD single is perfect - both songs are done beautifully live - creating an air of freshness and coziness that only R.E.M. can. It does fail to get five stars though because I am now forced to also buy Suspicion Cd single #1..which also seems to be a beautifully perfect cd too...
3,Magni-Guide,"I have a little trouble manipulating this little magnifier and found that just using drug store magnifier glasses worked better for me. It does a real good job of making the lines easier to read and I am sure would be appreciated by people who aren't all thumbs, like me."
3,Julian Bashir VS The Dominion Virus,"This episode is called ""The Quickening."" I mean come on! Isn't that a trademark from Highlander? Oh well, the writer had to come up with something to call it I guess. I would have called the episode ""The Red Death"", but enough of my rant on the name. The Dominion punishes a world with a virus. Julian has to save the day. It's pretty good, but not as good as its trailer was. 3.4/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,2/5 are you nuts?,"I wanted to give it a 5/5 just to bring up the avg, but it's not that good. I give it a solid 4/5 because I actually like how they imagined the alternate universe, the plot makes sense, and it's well realized. I love seeing the relationship b/n Jake-Dad-Mom even though it's not really his mom (but an alternate timeline/dimension Jennifer). It's still interesting to see how the writers imagined that unconditional love being able to find it's way across another dimension. It even made me get misty eyed there for a second, and there is a pretty awesome spaceship battle at the end."
5,There Were No Survivors,"""You're Dead, Cardassia is Dead."" said the Changeling. Don't skip this one. It's a great season cliffhanger, just like good Star Trek should be. It heats up the elements of all the DS9 story arcs, and leaves us wanting more. I especially like all the detail we get in 45 minutes. It's screen-worthy. 5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
3,He Is The Sisko.,"A challenge to the title of ""The Emissary."" That's pretty much as exciting as it gets with that role. This whole episode is about 2 things: 1) the relationship of best buddies. 2) Everyone should be free to do what they are good at. Besides that, there's not too much meat to this. One to skip if you've seen the series before. Pros: Worf and O'Brian, The Prophets. 3.1/5 stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,I wish I could see the whole story,"I ordered the DVD set because It was didfficult to view the series when it was originally broadcast. My local station scheduled it to air mid afternoon on Saturday - Excuse me, but I have a life!Now I received the DVD set, but each DVD won't play the last chapter or two of the 4th episode.I can ship it back to the merchant, but are the other sets similarly flawed.How do I reach the manufacturer?"
2,Gene Roddenberry would not have approved,"Another alternate reality episode. Really? Come on, this is STAR TREK. Not, ""How many sequels can we give to a plotline conceived in 1968."" Please don't get me wrong, I loved the episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" from The Original Series. I just hate that the writers kept making sequels about it for Deep Space Nine. They didn't have them in The Next Generation. Amd there's a good reason. Star Trek is about pushing the limits of Science Fiction while giving the viewer's Gene's Humanitarian view of what our potential can be. Mirror, Mirror was not about the alternate universe, but how we can be if we don't mentally evolve as a species. These episodes do nothing but distort his views. 2.0/5 Stars. Skip it, even if you like Star Trek. ~Keep On Trekkin' (to a better episode)."
2,"fun idea, lousy quality",The costume is fun...hilarious on my 13 year old. But the zippers for the back and the fan both broke after maybe 2 times trying it on. Also the fan started making a high pitched noise when it first started. The fan finally stopped making the noise and we used duck tape to close up the back so it was usable for halloween night but really not worth the money.
2,"Definitely NOT ""A Christmas Story"" level effort","This tale could have been told so much better than it was. There was none of the charm of living the story through Ralphie's eyes as with ""A Christmas Story"". Dad's frustrations and foibles were not dealt with in the misguided yet excusable manner as they were when Darrin McGavin took on the role. Charles Grodin's wooden portrayal of Dad left me feeling no sympathy, conjuring images of a cynical misanthrope bent on ""winning"" and nothing else. Randy was a complete empty hole in this movie, the role wasn't even necessary, and Mom was almost completely disconnected from the story. All in all, very disappointing considering Jean Shepard's skill at storytelling..."
2,Where's Ollie??,"When I googled ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"", ""My Summer Story"" showed up on the Amazon screen. I assumed this was a remake and ordered it on Netflix before buying it. Was I disappointed! The casting of the Parker family was inferior to ""A Christmas Story - especially Charles Grodin, who is no match to the marvelous Darren McGavin. There was no chemistry between Grodin and Steenburgen AND the story was totally different from the Ollie Hopnoodle film with James Sikkus, that I'd seen years ago, which was hilarious. A VHS version of this movie, USED starts at $70...a little expensive, I think."
3,An excellent follow up to Christmas story,"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this movie from all the bad reviews, but was very pleasantly suprised. I can't understand why so many have panned this movie! Its great! In some ways its better than Xmas story, I think the actors were wonderful in this one. If you've never heard of Jean Shepherd or Xmas story maybe you wont get much out of this movie, but for Shep fans like me, you WILL love it!"
4,Good one!,"Very good book, I do love the whole chronicles but, it is not as good as some of his other novels.The book finishes with a promise for another one, but I have not seen such one."
3,"Pretty good, too much about the writers","Like October '64, Halberstam gives a little too much coverage to sportswriters (their backgrounds, bio, etc.). I don't think anyone bought this book to learn about the writers. It stinks of cronyism.When he's not drolling on about Jimmy Cannon's favorite foods, it's a good baseball read."
3,"Early days of the ""Curse of the Babe""","The details of the games that kept the race tight right up until the seasons end were not as interesting as the behind the scenes commentary. This was baseball taking baby steps across the color barrier. This was baseball in an era when many of the greats were beginning to fade and the next generation of phemons were just arriving. Baseball in the throes of a painful but game saving transition. Halbertstam is especially good at focusing on some long forgotten players such as Ellis Kinder of the Red Sox.Although this book is devoid of the intracacies of the game, it is rich in lore and should elighten both the uninitiated and the baseball afficianado."
4,Got what I expected.,"Would have liked this in a hard cover, but couldn't seem to find it. It came as expected, but as I'd suggest to anyone, know that a soft cover book will get damaged pretty easily, especially in shipping."
3,it diffrent,its difrent but but somhey say are japanese seema little copyish of other storys but there still cool in there way not bad its more of a ehh.... kinda thing
3,not too bad,"Used the Pyle PLG64's to replace the blown Infinity mid base speakers in the doors of my dodge truck. The price was attractive. Of course you get what you pay for and you have to order two. They sound OK and once I go used to them, I think they are OK. I wish I had the money to buy the Kicker up grades but I didn't (or I didn't want to spend the money). If you are looking for something outstanding, as far as sound quality is concerned, you will be dissapointed."
1,Spec is not what they say,"China rubbish don't waste your time if you run it wath an amp the speakers can't take the power .when the arrived to Singapore and I open the box dam I was put down ""made in china"" was all over the box"
2,Somehow Ok,"I wasn't expecting much but to be a 300 watt woofer, i was disappointed. the woofers bass is not what i was hoping for, i can't even hear it...the original speakers of my car are better.. the good thing is that it was cheap...if you want to hear some bass with your music, these woofers are not the right one for that...PYLE PLG64 6.5-Inch 300 Watt Mid Bass Woofer"
1,Not impressed,I registerd for this product on-line w/o seeing it in person-this was a mistake. The mat is very thin and not comfortable to put the baby on. It requires batteries to be mildly entertaining. I say go for the standard play mats-not this one.
3,A Great Garage Sale Find,This was a great garage sale find for [$$$] but I definately wouldn't pay [$$$] for it!!!The playmat is just a thin piece of fabric and it doesn't do much more than play must and flash 3 lights.My 4 month old likes to bat at the star and moon though and it holds her attention for quite a long time.
1,Movie not much to do with the book,"This film is a complete misrepresentation of the book ""Prince of Tides."" After reaching of the film I couldn't stomach it any longer, I turned it off. The Prince of Tides is NOT just about the love story between Tom and Susan, it is also about growing up in the South and living amongst a dysfunctional family of abuse and social problems. There was absolutely nothing about Luke in the movie. Which by the way is the REAL Prince of Tides. Tom Wingo (Nolte) is NOT the Prince of Tides as stated in the movie. In fact the poem written by Savannah titled ""Prince of Tides"" was already written by the time Tom shows up in NY. I hate when Hollywood tries to change the stories they make movies on, such as the newest film, ""Count of Monte Cristo"", another total misrepresentation of the original story."
4,"perfect movie, less than perfect adaptation","This movie is one of Barbra Streisand's best, plotwise, direction wise, and most importantly acting wise. Her and Nick Nolte's acting is great, making this a very lovely movie in every single way. Except adaptation-wise.I do respect the fact that if the book were to be totally copied it would have been endless, but still, there are many points in plot and dialogue that are a lot stronger than that of the movieStill this movie is wonderfull, and even though it does not give the book its total value, it is one to see."
2,"Book was a 5 STAR , movie was a 2 STAR","The movies never do justice to Pat Conroy and his work. Read the book, much more enjoyable."
1,Memories not so beautiful -- an awful movie.,"Having just a read a book that reminded me of Prince of Tides, I was shocked to see how popular this movie is on Amazon! I saw this movie back in 1991 and it still haunts me.In 1991, I was appalled by Ms. Streisand's miniskirts and in particular her pink sweater cut SO low in the back. The wardrobe wasn't appropriate for one Dr. Lowenstein. The wardrobe was clearly a vehicle for one reluctantly aging pop star.Also, the music was so loud, so epic at times that I literally had to cover my ears. In one scene Blythe Danner left the room, but you could still see her reflection in a picture on a wall, waiting for her cue.I loved the first half of the book, hated the second. The movie was like fingernails scraping down a chalk board from the time I entered the theater."
5,Tom Wingo will always be Nick Nolte,I just finished the book and then watched the movie. The book is fantastic and so was the movie in its own way. Pat Conroy helped write the script and I am sure approved the changes. Captures a lot of the feeling of the book.
2,This movie has got something - yet not much.,"The images in this movie are beautiful and the music is quite beautiful too. And the lead-actress really does play well. Yet, this does not make it a good movie.There is repeatedly a kind of mystification which seems inappropriate to me.If there is no obvious story or plot, this need not be a problem; but this movie lacks authenticity, if you ask me. The movie is phantasy/imagination-driven, psychologically it is not realistic or mature; and I do not sense true inspiration or depth.Alienation is an important theme in this movie, but it is not really solved or confronted.Sex and intimacy is no solution.Beauty for beauty's sake is no solution.An art-movie without depth or primary-authentic inspiration is also no solution either.Yet the images and music, and the puppetshow-scene, make this movie certainly worth watching."
5,"great movie, great tranfer","This is a great movie, the criterion blu-ray transfer is great. We got the disc very quickly. This is consistent with the quality I expect from Criterion and the good customer service from Amazon."
5,haunting and beautiful,"This is perhaps the most haunting and beautiful film ever shot. Its images breathtaking, and its storyline one of the most ambitious ever. The sadness and poignancy of this film are overpowering, as is the music of Zbigniew Preisner. This movie will stay with you forever. Absolutely sublime. Thank you Mr. Kieslowski."
5,Great product,This is a great product very well made! I couldn't find any more of this product to finish my project and found what I needed on Amazon to finish! It was great and worry free!
1,Misrepresented,"I don't care how intriguing the effect is, infrared-like is not the same as ""Infrared."" Adding IR to the title of the item is a direct misrepresentation. Thanks, however, for fleecing me. Next time I'll know. SFX 200 is, as one can even learn by reading the film features, not an IR film."
3,good but lacking,"the book itself is an excellent literary resource for classical literature. the only problem is this specific print does not have the preface and therefore the information about the author is missing. to truly understand the premise of the author's point of view, we had to look on the internet to complete my daughter's assignment about the author..."
3,Perfect fit,The speakers were just what was needed to finish the project I was working on. It provided the look I was hoping for when inserted into the housing.
3,Good replacements,I could not find these in the store anymore so I ordered 6 to redo my closet hanger. They work fine but were not Amazon prime and seemed to take a while to get to my house.
3,bootlegs,"I've had this cd before and I could tell that it was a bootleg copy. I thought I was purchasing the original copyof the cd. I'm happy I have it. Its an ok copy, but I just thought I was going to receive the original copy."
1,Seriously disappointing,"Awkward, cliche-riddled dialog and emotions support a inept plot whose torturous contrivances defy any hope of suspending disbelief. (Examples include the suicide that's beyond explanation once its use as a red herring is over, and a murderer whose face should be familiar to all but is recognized only by a stranger with a faxed photo.) This book has little to recommend it, and as a fan of the McCone series I was seriously disappointed."
5,Awesome Movie!!!,"I recently purchased a brand spanking new copy of this movie for $8.04 counting S/H. I already own a good ex-rental, but knowing I had the chance to get probably one of the last new one's, well I just couldn't resist. If you have the chance, buy this one, I think it might be gone soon!!!"
4,Happy With Philips,"My husband purchased this TV for me for Christmas. So far, I am very happy with it. Wouldn't have minded a larger screen, but what I do have seems to be a great picture."
1,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this item! Especially at the price listed here. I bought it at Walmart, it crapped out after thirteen months. It had a lousy picture when I had it, and then it died. I wouldn't use this TV anywhere in the house. Trust me, just don't buy it!"
1,I've never seen a gauge so junky,"Pros: The kit have everything needed to install it, plastic tubing, pipe fittings (not the brass ""tee"" though) and everything to hook it up.Cons: The needle is very sticky, when the engine is revved the gauge should smoothly rise showing the increase in oil pressure. The needle in this gauge is jumpy and stops moving quite often, I even tapped it with my finger and got it to change a little.Overall, I'd use this gauge to see if an engine HAS pressure, as far as how much pressure and at what rpm I'd get a better one."
1,why is this still out there for sale ?,"After reading the reviews --I hate to buy this my dad wants one for Christmas....I thought we had something in place for ""lemon"" products.I guess I want to know why its still for sale if the workmanship is so poor --no improvements seem to be made at all.So where is this item made-- over seas I bet ...Like I said I hate to buy one .................."
4,Great gift!,"I bought this set for a friend's 20 month old daughter. She is a little younger than the recommended age but when I received it in the mail it looked great. We did take out the knives and forks but there were so many other pieces she never missed them. Overall, it was a great gift. She hasn't put them down yet and now she has something to cook along with Mom."
4,Pieces don't stack well,"The pegs don't stack easily on top of each other as well as on the yellow board. This yellow board is made of soft plastic and is not stable on surfaces. They may be more fun when threading a cord through them, but stacking proves difficult even for adult."
5,Exquisite,"A terrific book, depicting one of the world's greatest shoe designers and creators, Manolo Blahnik. Makes a wondeful coffee table book, which is filled with entising photographs. A fabulous book darlings!"
4,Living a Dishonest Life,"Just to clarify some of the other more high-toned reviews, this is the story that a man whose inclinations are thoroughly homosexual and inclined toward pederasty tells to male friends who, the reader infers, incline the same way. It is the story of his marriage and attempt toward a ""normal"" life. Though Marceline, his wife, is a paragon of sweetness, he cannot maintain a constant affection for her, and when she contracts tuberculosis, though he tries to be sympathetic, distraction and boredom send him off to the boys who infatuate him. The story is told subtley; you slowly realize that this an unreliable narrator who is more of a scoundrel that he makes himself out to be. It's impossible to think of an American politician (Gide held several important government jobs in France) writing a book like this!"
1,Horrible Movie,"I'm always drawn to Laura Linney movies. I also like Liam Neeson and sometimes Antonio Banderas. However, this movie's script was complete garbage, i.e., trite and unimaginative. Truly, it has about 5 minutes of linear plot if whittled down."
3,small remote,"If you have big hands, you'll hate the remote, but definately a good overall product. They could have spent a little extra time on the contrast ratio. It will be a good choice for me. Phillips is a quality product and has always done me good, this is a good buy if you don't mind fighting the remote. The buttons are small and close together. But as w/ the earlier comment ""best deal for under $700"" they were right. A good entry level lcd. It also arrived in 5 days w/ the super saving ""free"". I am pleased, might want to check for higher contrast ratios if you are picky."
2,Egypt Muslim Islam 1930s,"(From another's review): What Is This Moslem World? by Charles R. Watson. Friendship Press, New York, 1937. 207 pp.; softcover. This book, although written by a missionary of 35 years service, especially in Egypt, is not as polemical as some others of the same genre. Indeed, there is an effort at fairness not seen in other works by some missionaries of that time, and earlier. Chapter titles and subtitles include: Moslem Folk: Their Way of Life; The Grace and Dignity of Costume and Movement; Pervading Sense of God; Woman's Rights and Wrongs; Where Human Minds Stagnate; The Gripping Power of Islam; Ferment and Revolution; Islam's Contacts With Christiandom; & The Christian Missionary Movement."
5,The stories that inspired Twilight Zone episodes,"This book is a compilation of Richard Matheson's earliest short stories. If you are a fan of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone, you will absolutely love this book. There are three volumes in the whole collection; I recommend buying all three at once so you won't have to wait for more when you finish this volume."
2,"Good, but not great","This author is plugged by one of my favorite authors, Stephen King. I enjoyed some of these stories, but just because you like Stephen King, that does not mean you will necessarily like these. Most are weird, with sci-fi endings that seem tacked on. Not bad."
5,Cosmic child,"Practising the Cosmic Science is practical, deep, easy to read book ... it's simply Arroyo!"
2,Good music bad CD quality (perhaps shipping),I enjoy the old songs.. but CD skips at certain places. Not sure if it was the original condition or something happened during shipping.
2,Tea lacked sweet rich taste,"I will likely not purchase this tea again. I've tried other varieties of wu-long which were much more sweeter, smoother and richer in taste. I could not keep paying a lot of money for these quality teas, so I started my search for a cheaper wu-long tea, and that is why I purchased this tea. However, I am not satisifed with it. Even after steeping for a long period of time, the tea was dark but the taste was stale & not rich at all. I bought this because the price was good, and gave it 2 stars because it arrived nicely packaged & quickly. However, I would rather pay more money in the future for a better tasting tea."
3,Edwards,"I think this small book is a good skeletal outline of the great newsman's life. It is just right for those who want a quick review of the life and work of Edward R. Murrow. The best part of the book is Murrow's own words on such subjects as a bombing raid over Berlin and Senator McCarthy.For me, the author went off the rails in his Afterward. Yes, Murrow was one of a kind. But going into an extended, whiney complaint about the state of news in 2004 was paper wasted that could have been better spent on the book's subject. Mr. Edwards should sleep soundly rather than toss and turn from nightmares generated by either the excesses of cable TV news or those greedy/heartless corporations. Humankind has more and better access to real news from multiple sources than at any other time in history--given the Internet. The golden age of news and access to knowledge is now. Not those dreamy and heroic days when there were just two major televison networks."
2,A Star That Shone and Faded,"I remember very well listening to Edward R Murrow when I was growing up. His was the voice of authority. I laughed in this book when Edwards recounted how Murrow had to call the bingo numbers because his wife, who was the social director on the boat, was seasick. That must have been some bingo game.The history recounted in this book was fascinating, especially the relationship between Murrow and Walter Cronkite. The flame of TV journalism lit by Murrow was already fading by the time of his death and went out with Cronkite. Murrow's fears about the direction television was taking was prescient regarding the state of news broadcasting today. He just didn't know how bad it would get.I was interested to learn that Murrow was one of the forces behind PBS in a final attempt to salvage journalism in TV."
3,The first 10 pages contain 25 f*** and sh***,"One thing that struck me was the usage of bad words so frequently.Churchill, Heinz Guderian, etc too wrote about World War and he not even once did they use a single bad word."
2,"A fair Overview, but lacking substance","This book provides a fair description about modeling for basic business components. However, it fails to be useful for specifying a buildable or testable system and does not address enterprise issues. The models in chapters 4 and 5 are useful only for coffee discussions - they are far from practical for business analysts, requirements engineers, testers, and OO designers.Furthermore, it misses the mark by representing OO design as ontology under the disguise of UML diagrams. I was disappointed and expected more from a book that is published in the Object Technology Series."
2,Could not see the value of the book,"I bought this book by seeing its title. But, when I finished reading it, I did not learn anything new. The book is written as a novel instead of a technical book. Bottom line, I did not get the worth of my money back after reading this."
2,2 and a half stars,"A couple of Paramedics get called onto a scene by a little girl to help her mother that has gone into a cardiac arrest. Only they are interrupted by a group of whacko's who refuse to let them treat her, the whacko's then kidnap them, and take them to there cult hide away where they meet a man who calls himself ""The Teacher"" who dribbles on about them all going to be taken to a new world on the other side of the universe because the end of the world is coming.The acting and story are pretty good, but why I rate this movie low is because of the unsatisfying ending of the whole thing. There was a lot left unexplained and why go for a realistic approach just to blow the end end of the movie with such fictional bulldust?However, least this time the films maker didn't try to con you into believing the story was true just to sell a low budget movie, least he had a budget for this one to hire an entire film crew to make a proper movie..... it just needed a much better ending imo."
2,Believers,"Awful, just awful. I found myself to be incredibly bored by this movie. The pacing was horrible, the acting very wooden, and the storyline so incredibly predictable it was ridiculous. I do not understand how this could be called ""Unrated"" either, as there was hardly any blood, very little swearing, and one incredibly boring and pointless sex scene. It had a lot of potential, but fell flat on its face, I can not recommend this movie really at all. It was bad, and while not entirely unwatchable, this snorefest nearly put me to sleep. Oh, and you will be able to figure out the ending before you even see the movie, pretty sad."
1,Long live King Mercury,"When will people stop fighting for a chance to sit in Freddie Mercury's thrown? Good job Dwight, I just wanted to know when are you planning on releasing : Queen's Greatest Hits."
2,Sunbeam heated mattress pad buzzes!,"We are now on our third (3rd) queen size heated mattress pad (the first two were replaced under warrantee) and this is the first one where we have experienced this problem. I'm thinking that the wires extend too far up under the pillows as I can hear buzzing from the pad through the pillow when the heat is on and then it stops when the thermostat says it is warm enough. I lost about 1 1/2 hours of sleep last night due to this. Sunbeam says ""put a blanket over it""! That didn't work. I'm calling them again tomorrow and we'll see what the next 'fix' is!"
2,"Son likes it, I hate it","I totally agree with the above poster. My son loves this toy, but the pieces are always falling apart (it is a toolbox shape that opens and folds back up) The hinged pieces are always coming apart. I have stopped bothering to put it together to put it away. It is a very annoying toy because of this. They could have totally improved the design on this toy and I would have given it a good rating. I wouldn't recommend it until the manufacturer decides to put money and thought into the design. I find it to be a cheap piece of junk that didn't have to be."
1,Why didn't I just spend the extra money and get BRIO Bob...,My kids are very gentle with their toys and it still constantly falls apart. Just opening up the tool box will cause parts to fall off their hinges. The road pieces that are included do not stay together. Not much fun when your kids are constantly asking you to put it back together. Complete waste of money and total piece of junk.
1,The Bob blues,"My 2-year-old received this for his birthday....what a huge disappointment to him. Looks fun, but nothing stays together long enough to play with it. One piece gets put on, another falls off. I was going to return it but with so many loose pieces, we lost a few before being able to take it back. Manufacturers should not put junk like this out there, disappointing kids and taking people's money."
1,I wish I had read these reviews before I bought one!!,"I couldn't agree more about this product. It's appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. I think this toy will have to mysteriously ""disappear"" one night while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!!"
5,Excellent,"This is my favorite album from Incognito. There are several favorites on this disc, but to narrow it down, I would have to say that Shade Of Blue, Beneath The Surface, Without You, Hold On To Me, and Fountain Of Love are the ones that I like the most. The vocals on here are awesome and they are backed by a dynamic and consistent band. I recommend this one not only to jazz fans, but to fans of wonderful music because this is exactly what you will experience when you purchase this Incognito disc."
1,"Bass, bass and more bass ....................","I bought this on the strength of the reviews, but I'm not happy. The bass is dominant throughout the entire cd, sometimes even pushing vocals to the background. I know some people really like a strong bass mix, but if you like more balance, you won't like this."
1,Grohe Europlus 33939,After just 6 years of satisfactory use this faucet is ready for the junk yeard. We have tried unsuccessfully to talk with warranty personnel concerning a problem that no plumber can solve...even when talking with Grohe technicians. We are saddened and very disappointed in their lack of interest and response. The faucet was very expensive and is now ready for burial in the landfill!
3,Plain Tails from the Hills,"Quite inspiring to see what can man achieve when not scared. I think everybody can get from this book a little trigger to his successfull life. Not only for career, but for the life itself. I would prefer more pictures to get a little bit better imagination on their splendid life stories."
3,Not as engaging as the first record,"More like a 3.5.This record isn't as engaging as his first record. These songs are more straight-forward compositionally and arrangement-wise and the record suffers for it. Gone is the cool ear candy and funky riffs for a more laid-back, smooth jazz approach (though still decidedly a cut above most of the stuff out, in true McComb fashion). There's some heavy balladry here that showcases his vocals nicely, but as complete songs don't ""go there"", and many of the recurring soul workouts don't push the unique envelope the first record did.Not even close to being a bad record, but probably not quite worth the ""rarity"" price you'll likely end up paying for it."
3,Nice one.,"I thought it'be a better production, but it looks like a low budget film (must have been. it certainly feels like a low budget movie). If you want to know more about John Wesley, look at an encyclopaedia. But if you want to know even more and want to take a look at time scenario, maybe it's worth it seeing this."
5,Build Some Confidence,"I find this such an amazing book. I loved it so much. I am using this book for a book report and I find that it will be the best.I am doing a bookseller's day and I will try to sell this book. I feel that it will be successful for me because this book is so interesting. Sometimes it is so touching it can make you cry. Jean Little is such a brave girl and into such a talented young lady and to a real grown up person. I feel that this book will teach you a great lesson by having someone sharing their past with you and everyone around. Everything in the book is so real because all those things have probably happened in some school. People getting bullied. But the thing is, no one ever stands up for themselves and I find Jean Little such a spectacular person."
4,A classic.,"Lester Young's tenor is so unbelievable it's hard to believe. This album pairs him with the Oscar Peterson Trio and together they made a gem of an album. Every track is simply amazing and they vary from upbeat to down, to tracks that sizzle. Like 13 ""(It Takes) Two To Tango"", such a great song. If you love jazz there is absolutely no way you can not like this album. Period."
2,*THIS WAS OKAY*,"I actually liked the way this started out more than the way it ended. Audrey is a goof if you ask me. She takes advantage of the one guy who is true and sincere to her. I don't enjoy the games the 3 ""roommates"" play. This book could be passed up and you wouldn't be missing much."
1,No use for any 3d work. FORGET IT,"A catalogue of nicely rendered images, yes. Fine for your coffee table, but no use whatso-ever for any 3D work.All of the poly meshes supplied are (poorly) auto-reduced versions of the original geometry that the images in the book were rendered with. At best, the supplied meshes can only contain 5% of the orignal geometry. You will find highter resolution models on a games console than on this CD. There are one or two ""high res"" models included on the CDROM, but they're not worth bothering about.As an example of how weak this is, take the aircraft model that has a 350k two tone tif texture (could have been 4k) which was actually bigger then the 300k .3DS file. Many of the textures themselves are pooly produced, badly sized or badly anti-aliased, so if you're thinking it's worth the money just for the textures, then think again.If you like pretty pictures, then get it. If you want 3D models then simply don't bother with this."
1,So disappointed........,"I am so disappointed with my candy boxes. I bought 4 boxes 40, 80, and two 90s. Each box had pretty much the same candy with the exception of maybe three different ones. One of my boxes arrived with a torn handle. I will never order these candy boxes again, and I really wish that I could return them without paying a mountain load of money for the shipping and handling. I give the boxes two thumbs down."
3,If Arnie were in this film it would help a lot.,Pretty sad sequel to Predator.The first film having great suspense and tons of action gives way to a strange new predator and a cheesy ending battle.If Arnie were in this one it would add to the story a lot.Hope they make another one with Arnie back in action.
3,GOOD BLU RAY TRANSFER,Well I think the Special Edition DVD released a few years back was of same quality. I hoped that DIrector Hopkins would have done something to improve the look of the film. While the action is top notch the visual appeal of the movie is not up to standard. Overall good disc if you want to add to your collection.
3,Predator 2: The hunt continues...,"""Predator 2"" is a fairly good film. In this case the original ""Predator"" was much much better. The story is about another Predator that has made its way to earth and this time its target is the entire city of Los Angeles. Many people underrate this film but it has a good story attached to it. The casting however is terrible however Bill Paxton fullfilled his role quite well. Danny Glover was a bad choice and when many people left the cienema the night it came out they were chanting ""WE WANT ARNOLD."" The end of this film is very good. Worth buying if ur a science fiction fan and you like the original ""Predator"" and ""The Alien Quadrilogy"". If your not dont bother but if you havent seen it. See it and make your own decision."
3,Only The Predator Shined!,"The Predator returns to earth for a new challenge. This time in the city. This movie stars Danny Glover and Gary Busey, just throw in Mel Gibson an we could have been watching Lethal Weapon meets Predator. This movie was a snack next to the first one, but still deserves a better DVD release along with the first Predator. The story could have been better. Nuff Said"
4,A Almost Perfect Sequal,"Out of all the Predator films(this one,the first,and AVP),this one is probably the worst,but that is not a bad thing.It's just that Predator 1 and Alien Vs. Predator are better films.Still,if you looking for good acting,a interesting story,and some of the best action scenes ever,look no further.Predator 2 delivers all that and more.I recommend this!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as the first one -that's obvious- but it's good enough,The Predator creature is back and has some cooler gadgetry. Lots of great action. Not always the best dialogue but decent enough.
2,"Can you say ""Dumbed- down sequel""?","I had rented this movie with great anticipation and was very dissapoited. As a fan of the original I think they tried too hard at the action horror scheme. This blood drenched sequel has very little plot development. What I liked about the first was missing, hilarious jokes from the soilders, the Predator wondering about Earth creatures, and all the scary moments that got Predator a place in history. If you've never seen the first and are looking for a mediorce at best horror movie try it. Another thing, if you're going to bother with it buy or rent it, the television version is not worth your time."
2,Predator goes street smart.,"Just another excuse to make a another downtown shoot 'em up film. We don't know how the Predator made it into Los Angeles, but he is on the chase for Danny Glover, Ruben Blades, maria Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton and Gary Busey.Also in the cast: Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Calvin Lockhart and Kent McCord (original ADAM-12 tv series).Elpidia Carrillo who was in Predator (1987) makes an appearance as ""Anna"".Followed by Alien vs. Predator (2004)***Alien vs. Predator: Requiem will be released December 25, 2007."
2,Oh my god! They killed Gary Busey! Those bastards!,"When I watched this movie, I was pretty young. But I remember it dawning on me about 30 minutes into the movie that Arnold was just not going to show up."
1,Awful,"This movie is absolutly atrocious. I like Bill Paxton, but he is so bad in this movie it makes me cringe. The Predator action scene are nifty at best. My main gripe with this flick is the plot hole in the beginning. The Predator is known for killing anyone who is armed, yet Danny Glover pulls a gun on this thing and he walks away. Uggh!!"
5,Excellent Sequel,"This fine film has sat on the shelf too long - at last, the DVD. C'mon, you low reviewers, this movie has everything you want in an action movie - and it actually works as a movie. Aliens who hunt for sport, secret government organizations set up to study them clandestinely, Jamaican druglords, annoying reporters and heroic cops - including Danny Glover, who is terrific in this movie. All of Glover's co-stars create believable, interesting characters as well. This movie works well on a number of levels. It's an ACTION MOVIE, for cripe's sakes! And, it's cheap, so buy it."
4,"Not his best, but still very good",The only reason this isn't a five star rating is because I compared it to other L'Amour works. A little slower than some but still a very good story.
3,The Kids Money Book,"A great book which introduces how to earn, save, invest and of course how to spend wisely. This most likely will be a book that can be used as a building block for the future."
2,UNDISPUTEDLY the wackest film.....,"Let me begin by saying that I didn't buy this DVD but watched it on Cable. I'm writing this review to deter folks from buying the DVD. It was a waste of time completely. Had I gone to see this film in theatres I would've been disappointed immensely. The plot was so dumb. If Columbo could get Ving Rhames out of prison, why couldn't he get Wesley out, better yet why couldn't he get himself out??? How dumb is that? This should have been a tv movie at best, never hit the big screen. Rhames and Snipes are two decent actors, too bad they weren't allowed to show any acting abilities from this poorly written script."
1,Could not finish it,"I usually finish any book I read, but this one did not entertain me; it did not interest me in the characters, setting, nor concepts. I'm surprised it's still in print, since it was first published in 1974 and doesn't seem to be worth reading after 25 pages."
5,Well balanced sticks,I got these for my Nephew for his birthday. I have indoctrinated him into the skills of Neil Peart for years. He immediately started to use them and commented on how he liked the balance. He does not know it yet. but I have Rush tickets in April and he and I are going to see Neil in Person.
5,One of my Favorites,"I bought this on vinyl in the early 80's. I still have it, but the record and turntable are in a storage unit about 1000 miles from me now. The tape I made wore out years ago and I have been looking for this on CD for at least 8 years.The people at Tower records would not try to order it for me several years back, because it was out of print and an import. Needless to say I have not been a customer since then. Amazon and the internet are fantastic.Walking in the Rain is the best cut on the CD, but it is followed closely by Hey, St Peter, Down Among the Dead Men, African Shuffle, California and the others.THERE IS NOT A BAD TRACK ON THE CD, absolutely great. We listened to it many nights at Minsky's in Campustown."
2,Muito técnico,"O livro apresenta gráficos, equaes e muita teoria, mas no ví nada que pudesse aplicar às minhas fotos. Talvez fizesse sentido na época do filme, mas para as DSLR's no é muito útil."
2,Pyle Pss4,I HAVE NOT BEEN TOO HAPPY ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND FROM THIS PURCHASED USED PRODUCT. TO BE FAIR I AM GOING TO CHECK ALL WIRING AGAIN
4,More atmospheric than most Carrs,"Better atmosphere than many of his books, but not quite the top drawer puzzle as in many of his other books."
1,Beautiful bed - but mobile is a dud!,My 6 year old asked Santa Claus for this bed and Santa delivered via Amazon.com. When we received the bed before Christmas we assembled the bed only to find that the mobile was a dud. We are still waiting (30 days later) for a replacement. It is not worth the money - look for another bed that works.
4,not as fun but still needed,i got this for my b-day and i i like it alot it is just didn't know what to do with it that is why i gave it 3 stars for funlike some other reivews the matteres wasn't thick enoughand things on it like the head bourd could fall off that is why i gave it 3 stars for durable and the educational valus were kind of low but i would still recomand it to my friends enen though with ny closet door shut i can still here the mobil
5,My introduction to the maestro,"While watching jazz piano videos on youtube I found a number of people performed a song called ""Hymn to Freedom"". That's when I learnt of Mr Oscar Peterson who happens to have composed the very song. Before then, I had never heard of him. From that day to this day I've been hooked on this gentleman's music. His rendition of the classic ""Georgia on my mind"" is legendary.Some people say Mr Oscar Peterson WAS one of the greatest piano players, well I duly respectfully assert IS the greatest player; Yes I know it's my opinion but then again there you have it!The CD is a gem indeed."
3,oscar is never wrong,"Oscar Peterson was a perfect fabricator, in the spirit of Alfred Tennyson in poetry. Also, Ray Brown swings like mad, even when he's just going quarter note to quarter note."
2,Not a very helpful book,"Im a 3rd year youth football coach, first year head coach, i found no useful drills that i hadn't heard of in this book. There were some decent drills that i had heard of though, so maybe it would be helpful to first year coach."
2,YAAAWWWN Surprising bore of a book from one of the best,"This book was boring, unlike 90% of Mr. de Lint's work I found this unenlighting, completely dull and uninspireing. Sadly I can see some of the potential but there is so little elaboration and it all ends so quickly. Even most of his short stories read better than this novella.The whole main plot of the puzzle box is so lacking in detail and the we are only given a glimpse of who brings the box to the plot and then they disapear never to be heard from again. This book SHRIEKS out for another 200 pages of some decent plot development. It almost seems like this was either written by de Lint when he was much younger, or by someone completely different. Of all the de Lint books, this is the only one I did not keep."
2,Save your $$ Get Bad Taste instead.,Zombie is right! The movie moves as slow as a zombie. There are a few good shots of gore however unfortunately it's mingled in with a bunch of boring story lines. It has several nudity scenes of ugly women. When I watch the movie I fast forward to the few good places and it takes about 15 min. to few the whole DVD. When I watch a gore flick I want to see a gore flick. Not a bad story with ugly nude women.
2,OUTDATED MOVIE.,"The acting, dialogue and overall feeling of this movie is sadly outdated, boring and with little thrill to today's standards. The original night of the living dead is perhaps a much better movie. The quality of this dvd is very bad with a picture quality below vhs standars and the sound is very flat and very late 60s style. Overall: BAD."
3,Too slow,"It takes over an hour before it gets any good. The last twenty minutes are all thats worth watching as FINALLY zombies show up and start doing what they do best. I like many of the Italian horror movies, but i wouldn't put this one on the top of my list. Decent gore effects though"
4,ZOMBI,"ANYTHING IS GOOD THAT HAS ZOMBIES.....i am actually waiting for the day where the dead will rise and plunge us into a 90's romero-esqe world. but my personal prayers aside, the movie was creepy and had some suprising effects. not to mention you get to see a zombi fight a shark."
4,An excellent Italian gore-fest by a horror-genre pioneer,"This movie, the best foreign zombie flick I've seen to date, is definitely worth watching if you're a dedicated zombie fan. Not only does it benefit from the pooling of American and Italian resources, but it does so extremely well with a low budget. See this film, despite its bad rap!! Expect state-of-the-art special effects (which honestly rival some of what you'll see in today's film market), an awesome battle between a zombie and a real live shark, and ancient Spanish conquistador zombies rising unexpectedly from the jungle ground to devour the living."
2,Overated Turkey Stuffing,"After hearing how great this was from all the horror and zombie geeks I thought one day when I grew up I'd finally get to watch it. I mean I've seen the shirts of that zombie with a worm in his eye and it looked frightening. Boy this was a pure waste of .50 cents! This is a stupid and over rated piece of junk. There is nothing original in this film and any direction is lacking from the ""great master"" Fulci, (great hack?). I've was disappointed so many times when renting from the cheap bins but occasionally there is something worthwhile but this isn't it!"
1,maybe the dullest zombie movie I've ever seen,"A pretty decent ending can't make up for the hour this move took to get to it.For what is touted as an adventure film, 'Zombie' just TRUDGES along at an infuriatingly slow pace.Also, be warned, I was attracted to this piece due to it's reputation as an unofficial sequel to the wildly superior 'Dawn of the Dead.' I can now say that I can't see any connection whatsoever to the two movies.Spare yourself the aggravation, skip this one and just rewatch the Romero '... Dead' trilogy. 'Zombie' is nothing more then a poor movie that was clearly made to ride the coat-tails of Romero's work."
2,The Worst Zombie Movie I've Ever Seen.,"I reall like zombie movies and when I bought this I thought it would be like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. The Zombies were extremly fake looking, the acting sucked, but the plot was decent. The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because there where zombies."
4,horror movie fan,"This is one of the scariest zombie horror flicks that I have ever seen! If you've seen more recent zombie movies, such as Return of the Living Dead, you'll love this one! The special effects and make-up were awesome considering the era that this movie was released(1979)."
3,a lot of fun,"It may not have the social commentary and black humor of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" but this low-budget gem from Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci is still a lot of fun. The makeup effects are over-the-top and grisly, and the zombies are impressive despite the low budget. It's also worth noting that Fulci managed to keep things a bit more coherent here than in later efforts, even though that's not a real big deal with genre films such as this."
3,Too overated,"Seriously folks this one is extremely overated. Everyone says its loaded with gore but there is only the splinter eyeball scene two throat rippings one really good one terrible a few very brief head explosions they sound good but they aren't it takes this movie a long long time to get off it's ass and start moving, but however the zombies are some of the best i've ever seen the gore while in small quanities looks good, there is some likeable charatchers (Tisa Farrow is HOT) and the acting is above most zombie films. I would rent this before buying."
5,CLASSIC!!!,Just adding another five stars to this classic. Certainly one of the best if not THE best zombie film.
3,Silly and stupid but good fun.,"A silly but very enjoyable zombiefilm by Lucio Fulci. Many thinks this is a classic, but I shouldn't exactly call it that. But it's never boring and I have seen it many times so I guess that says something. The best thing with this film is its wonderful music, worth watching just for that. If you like watching old 80's slasher films this is a must."
1,Not Worth The Price,"I do not feel that this book was worth the $17.95 price tag and have returned it to Amazon.The production of this oversided paperback book is very home brewed. The page layout, font selection, and printing of the design are of poor quality.The book gives only ""Net Carb"" counts for recipes rather than complete nutritional information which can be calculated easily with an inexpensive program like MasterCook. The lack of proper nutritional information makes the recipes fairly useless by diabetics and people who are other than Aitkins-like diets.On top of the production and nutritional value problems, the recipes that I tried were just plain not tasty. They lacked in basic sweetness, and in remaking some and adding extra Splenda, they never did achieve an acceptable flavor.If you are thinking of buying this book to satisfy your sweet tooth, expect to be disappointed."
3,Certainly not what I expected,"The local christian book store had this on sale for $5...how could I go wrong? Well, my son didn't even want to watch the whole thing. Although the pups are cute, it is very slow moving. He loves animals, but shows no interest in finding out what happens in the end. The sibling rivalry, name calling, greedy attitudes and sexually charged scenes are not recommended for a family movie at my house. We'll stick to our Space Buddies movie!"
5,A lively account of the pond from early to modern times,"Some 700,000 people visit Walden Pond annually and others journey to Walden mentally in contemplating of the region Henry David Thoreau made famous. It's surprising, therefore, to note that this is the first history of Walden Pond to appear in over 150 years, providing a lively account of the pond from early to modern times. W. Barksdale Maynard teaches architectural history at Johns Hopkins University and one might anticipate from this a dry perspective: not so. Walden Pond captures the social, political and conservation issues revolving around Waden over the decades."
2,Competent but corny,"Dull and uninspired, this is precisely the type of music true jazz fans will want to stay away from, although more general audience might fall for it.If you like Diana Krall, she is a guest on this CD (surprise, surprise!), singing on two songs."
4,Written by a Grandmaster Driver,"I have actually started driving since a a bit more than a year ago. I was taught the basics by my friends, but I knew i had to learn more than those ""basics"", so I bought a lot of books and read them on my spare time. This book written by Scotti is something that really helped me a lot because it has a lot of information and detailed explanations, including the physics involved in driving. Somehow, the knowledge I gained here helped me become a more confident and a reliable driver. I would recommend this book for all who really need to become good drivers. Don't just drive, drive safely, well and correctly! This is the essence of the book. And how to do that? It's in this book."
2,Bugsy,This movie is just so about Warren Beatty. I did not even finishwatching as it was just plain boring.
3,Could've been better,"This CD, which should've been a thrill to listen to, as it was the last recorded meeting of the Bird and Dizzy, was decidedly unimpressive. As for all the breakdown takes and false starts, they are at times interesting, but the idea becomes tedious. The major downside to this album is the drummer, Buddy Rich. Rich's straight ahead swing drumming is completely out of sync with what the rest were trying to do. Here you have Parker, Gillespie and Monk, and then you have to throw in Rich. Would that it were Max Roach, or any number of other excellent drummers in the bebop tradition. On the whole, disappointing."
4,Something different to read,"In my junior year of high school, I was required to do a research paper on two books. I was looking for something different to read and write about and I came across Alan Paton's novels, ""Cry the Beloved Country"" and ""Too Late the Phalarope"". Reading these books, I am aware of the harsh realities of apartheid but was mesmerized by the literary input that Alan Paton wrote of his countrymen and South Africa. Peter was a travesty to himself and to his family. He had an affair with a native and caused a rift between his father and himself. He is forced to confront the reality of how people in society are treated. Frankly, I got a B for the research paper."
5,Excellent!!!!!!,I totally loved this book. I really liked the part when Mandie met Celia in Celia's room at the school. Every girl who loves mysteries has just GOT to read this book!!! Hilda is great too. I like the way Celia and Mandie found her. And it would difinately ruin the book if Tommy Patton and Robert Rogers weren't in it!! They are totally a great addition.
3,"Looks nice, but not great...","Ok... I REALLY wanted to love this pan. The design is wonderful, and the pan is solid. Washes up great. Just one thing... the snowflakes can barely be seen on the final product. I've now made over 5 different shortbread recipes and the results are all the same... VERY FAINT pattern when you remove your shortbread. I've tried pushing down the shortbread really hard (so it would have a really good chance of an in-print) -- nothing. I've tried to just lightly tamp the shortbread in -- nothing. I was sad. Now, the shortbread releases easy... it cooks even... everything about this pan is great, EXCEPT for the depth of relief in the pattern. I went back to my good old-fashioned standby 8x8 Pyrex glass pan, and finished the rest of my baking."
5,It should have six stars,"I like this rice pasta better than wheat. It has a nice chewy quality, it feels substantial against any sauce. I don't care for rice, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that Tinkyada Brown Rice Spirals go really well with Indian and Chinese cuisines. And it's made with Brown Rice, could it be better? It's surprised me totally how good this rice pasta tastes! And for the gluten sensitive it's really wonderful."
1,this stuff is horrible,"I heard all the hype about tinkyada pastas and did a taste test between the tinkyada brown rice spiral and the orgran rice spiral - also brown rice.My results were very disappointing.The tinkyada took like 20 minutes to cook, the orgran took 7 minutes.Tinkyada had a very gummy mouthfeel, the orgran spiral had a clean mouthfeel and a nice texture - after only 7 minutes in the water.I made the tinkyada pasta using both sets of cooking directions on the package, same result - very disappointing.Will I buy tinkyada again? No!"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"Ladder 49 was not the type of film I expected-- I was hoping for a good, fast-paced action flick, which I got for about the first 5 minutes. The remainder of the 30 minutes that I watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station.Someone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie. However, those looking for action should probably look elsewhere."
4,SMOKIN!,"This is a hot movie, literally! It really makes you appreciatefirefighters, alot more! It's not a happy movie, but it'svery well made. Have some tissues handy, you'll need them."
2,UNINSPIRED AND UNCREATIVE,"This movie is sort of a flag waving movie for firefighters, which is ok in principle, but it's not very well done. Most of all it has no real story or momentum. A review of the main character's life is the sole ""story"". This is a sharp contrast to the much more engaging and dramatic ""Backdraft"".The fire scenes are fine, but again they were probably more interesting in Backdraft."
5,Great movie,"one of my favorites, a great movie for all firefighters something that's good for a family night or a date night or even down time at the station"
3,This Movie will play you like a Violin...,"This movie has no respect for the audience's intelligence.I REALLY wanted to like this movie. It seemed to be the kind of movie that I would be interested in.Well, if you like a movie that has a weak, better yet, no storyline and tries to manipulate your emotions, then this one is for you.This movie is made up of scenes from a firefighter's life. While many of the scenes are interesting and/or funny the point of a movie is to tell a story. This movie tells a story but the story consists of:See Jack join fire department.See Jack joke and hang out with other firefighters.See Jack put out fires.blah, blah, blahOh, let me not forget. every 10 minutes or so this movie likes to reach out and grab your emotions and make you feel happy/sad. I found this aspect of the movie to be very annoying and manipulative. The audience deserves more respect than that. Parts of the movie remind me of a Save the Children commercial."
2,"In b&w, static picture, sound could be better","This documentary, in black and white, shows the artist playing violin solo, with accompaniment, or in concerts, but the scenes are relatively static, the quality of sound could be better, and the picture in not much richer than a slightly animated slide show, unless the objective is to see the artist's technique. There is no much advantage of watching this documentary over listening just the music from CD."
2,A chauvenist's plot tips,"I'm only on page 24 and I'm put off by the guy's misogynist attitude. ""I use 'he' predominantly and 'she' in instances where the facet is particular to a woman."" Okay, so I'll just pretend most fictional characters are male...? So then he reverts to ""she"" when he discusses a character's ""grooming"" and ""body language"". Or ""Romance: Does the ex-wife want to get back at her former husband?... Is she a prostitute trying to change her ways?"" Boy, female characters sure are pathetic. It's subtle, but I can't help feeling he doesn't think highly of women, fictional or otherwise. I do like his idea that character begets plot, so I'll finish the book, but I'm disgusted and skimming it."
4,"Great buy, excellent HD picture, Sleek and Stylish","We did a lot of research and saw what sales were running after Thanksgiving before deciding on this one. For the price, the little bit of extra money to get a Sony was worth it. It was super easy to set up and the HD channels are incredibly vibrant and sharp. The only complaints I have is the picture for regular cable channels is very fuzzy, and the sound quality is not nearly as good as my LCD Samsung TV. It's very hard to hear the dialogue even though I customized the sound to help this is as much as possible. I am going to hook it upto a Sony Bravia compatible home theatre system and see if that helps. Highly recommend otherwise, and am still glad I bought it."
5,Excellent,"My 3-year old daughter loves this book. It's perfectly repetitive, and it's a great message. A great gift."
3,"Mitford ""Lite""","I eagerly anticipated the release of this book, looking forward to a lengthy return to Mitford and it's lovable characters. Instead I received an unsatisfying hour and a half of Mitford ""lite"", a book barely more meaty than an outline. The margins are obviously widened and the spiritual messages, always portrayed by Jan Karon with such ""right to the heart"" flair, are barely set to motion before spinning out into another quick direction.I would skip this one if I had it to do over. There's no engaging plot, and other than a moment here and there of familiar nostalgia for the town of my dreams, I was largely disappointed.I hope Ms. Karon's heart is back in the next book."
5,A misunderstood gem,"I'm not sure why the reactions to this book are so unbearable and insipid. SHEPARD'S ABIDING is a beautiufl story written with such warmth that I was sad when it ended. I finished the book in one afternoon and am anticipating Karon's swan song, LIGHT FROM HEAVEN, in November. I will deeply saddended to see a lovely series come to an end. This series is rare to find in bookstores; we need more of this kind. Enough violence."
4,A TREAT!!,"As a Jan Karon fan, I was delighted by this bonus of a book since I had heard there was to be just one more book in the series. It is longer than the previous Christmas books and shorter than some of the earlier books in the series. There illustrations on the insides of the covers are lovely.The book does assume that you know most of the characters from previous books, but it is a heart-warming story with a surprising addition to Father Tiom's usual activites. Certainly, we would be challenged & improved by trying such a complicated project in later life.A great story to read with holiday music in the background after a chaleenging day of Christmas chores. It is a great way to center on the real message of Christmas."
5,Wears like I've owned it a year,This is a terrific ball cap. I really like the vintage design and colors. Putting it on for the first time felt like it was hand washed and worn for a year. Very comfortable fit. Would definitely shop with PA again. Thanks guys!
5,So far so good!,"I bought 5 of these hats in various colors for my husband. They are a nice heavy cotton, in true to picture colors. They look high quality, and have so far withstood washing."
2,Comfortable but color not what was expected,I ordered a brown cap but the color looked more faded when I actually got the item in the mail.
3,"The cap is more ""low profile"" than the picture appears","This cap sits quite high on my head. I am accustomed to low-profile as more 'baseball cap' type, versus trucker style. In this case the cap looks more like the kind Beaver Cleaver wore; or, like on the kid in the Godzilla movies. (Maybe that's what is meant by ""Vintage."") The fabric itself doesn't appear time-worn; more like the twill of a Texaco shirt when new.It's tough to be too critical of an $8 hat. Otherwise, the three-star rating would be lower."
5,dvd users love it,"This unit has one of the higest ratings for long term durablity and working with various media of any player out there. if you go to videohelp dot com you can see the unit now has a rating of 9.5 stars after two years of use. Not one mention of the failure some person has made multiple posts about.someone with sour grapes got another panasonic unit two years ago (just before they changed drive manufacture plant to the most reliable one there is). they are using the same lannguage and diction to post a bad review of every single panasonic product!Don't believe it, look at the long term use reviews on the site I mentioned. these are dvd afficianodos using units over a year or two and reviewing them. This is a great unit and one of THE MOST DURABLE."
1,Don't buy Panasonic DVD players until they resolve H07,"The motors on several Panasonic models have quit working after about a year. Do a search on ""Panasonic DVD error code H07"" in Google and watch what comes up. Until they get their act together I would avoid Panasonic all together."
2,Reads all media...but junk,"Unit reads DVD-R and MP3 cds without a hitch. After 5 months, the unit would not read any discs and would power off after several minutes. It's now in the trash."
2,Broke after 3 movies!!,"Easy to set up, but it the power doesn't come on -- and after playing just 3 movies. I purchased one in mid-December and am sending it back to Panasonic for repairs!!"
4,Another great album BUT....,"They waste your time with the ending.After delivering 20+ minutes of very enjoyable speedy ultra catchy pop-punk with clever lyrics and more stylistic flourishes than you'd think (a really good COUNTRY song? Yeah, there's one on here!), they end the album with a good 15 minutes of annoying jamming. I don't know why, but its not that interesting to listen to and it ends the album on a sour note.I'll not hesitate to say that the Ergs have been the best pop-punk band from the 2000's that I've heard so far. They've certainly gone further with the genre in their brief existence than most other bands have. But this album is the weakest of their CDs. Both ""Dorkrockcorkrod"" and ""Hindsight is 20/20"" would be better places to start.That said, its still a very good album from an excellent band, just its deceptively short and ends in a disappointing way."
4,Simple design works,The design makes it easy to for it to dispense single sheets. Looks good in a kitchen with black/dark counter tops and stainless steel finishes.
1,"Horrible, biased book.","I found this book spectacularly unhelpful, and ridiculous in the sense that it actually encourages the reader to think that they know more than their experienced, educated medical providers AFTER ONLY READING THIS BOOK! What a crock. It also shows a clear bias against any medical professional and implies that their motives are simply to make your birth as convenient for them as possible. I am considering throwing this book away, which is something I have NEVER done. Waste of money and paper."
4,Solid Book if you are looking for info on natural birth,"Is this book slanted? Yes! All books are toward the authors's opinion. Henci Goer is obviously a natural childbirth advocate!!! If nothing else, this book aids parents in understanding what topics are controversial in the natural birth/labor process and has helped my husband and I know what questions to ask and what topics should be covered to be prepared for a natural birth in a hospital. I do not think it should be your only resource, but it is recommended if you are looking into natural childbirth."
2,An extreem portrait of American doctors,"While the facts maybe true, I felt there is no need to portray the situation in black-and-white (Doctors are bad, home birth is good). IMHO a thinking woman will not accept such a one-sided view, and will want to understand both sides."
2,False advertising,"The invoice said that the item had no writing or hilighting in the book. The book very clearly had both. Content-wise, the book was great. I just wish that the seller had been more thorough in their analysis of the book's faults and defects."
2,"helpful info, but biased","I bought the book based on the title and some of the reviews that I had read, expecting a book that would provide the pros and cons of different scenarios and allow the reader to come to her own decision. The book did provide some interesting info and stats, but it was so full of anti-OB rhetoric that sifting through the bias made it hard to come to any sort of informed decision."
2,Too biased and scary,"This book too biased in my opinion, even for me who am planning a natural, non-medicated birth next month. It makes it sound like you or your baby will die if you chose to use medication during birth, I have witnessed several amazing and uncomplicated epidural assisted births, so I use it just if I want to look up something specific, not a cover to cover read. I feel like the combo of ""Natural Hospital Birth"" and ""Active Birth"" would be all that I needed to read to feel really excited, prepared and confident for my natural birth process. Also working on reading Ina May's book, as well as Birthing From Within, but i still think the other two would have been enough"
4,Much-needed alternative to the party line.,"In all fairness, I do find the tone of this book distrustful and antagonistic toward general o.b. practices in this country. But the info is valuable, illuminating, and aided me in my decision to go natural. I should add that hypnobirthing techniques aided me even more, and helped me stay a little more positive (I'm naturally sort of negative).The surgeon/reviewer below is a great example of what I fear about doctors (male or female, and I've got several drs in the family). What he does for a living (refurbish women's 'damaged' vaginas) means that he's right and vaginal birth's a bad way to go? End of discussion. Wow. Life's too short, friend. I'm glad I chose a better man than you."
5,Anyone Expecting a Child Should Read This Book,"A previous reviewer stated: ""The author is much too eager to heap blame and criticism upon the medical profession. ""That's only because they deserve it. I'm glad you had an excellent birth, but your story alone is anecdotal evidence isn't it? This book provides the scientific proof. This is not a 'touchy-feely' newage birth book. This is hard core scientific research. Does the author have a bias? Yes. But the question is why? Because study after study have shown that modern obstetrics is missing the point and ignoring the research -- and women and babies are suffering for it."
4,An interesting perspective,"This presentation was very interesting and informative from a Jewish perspective; especially for non-Jewish observers like me. For many years I have been interested in the history and lives of God's chosen people; to try to understand their culture and why the world has shown them such hatred toward them. This DVD has narratives which point to the Christian's persecution of the Jews - but, more accurately, the Jews were persecuted by the Catholic Church; not by Bible believing Christians.This presentation should be filtered through a basic knowledge of the Catholic inquisitions in which ALL non-Catholics were martyred for not converting whether they be Jews, muslins or Christians.Nevertheless, I can feel just some the pain of persecution which they have suffered over the centuries and only wish there was some end in site."
5,Success 2000 is about being happy and fulfilled,"I love this book and am grateful for having it as a resource to share with my coaching clients. It's practical, with steps that make sense for being happy and fulfilled in your career and life as a whole. It's all about integration and the author is a fabulous model for that in her life."
3,A bit more sailing content woud have been better than a song...,"A bit dissappointed by lack of any real tactics or technical discussions by the crew and schipper, but beautifully filmed...In short a bit ""LITE""."
5,Morning Light is fantastic,"As a sailor working with young people, this is a great way to infect them with a keen desire to go sailing. We need more youth related experiences to draw others to this great way to build confidence, friends for life, and have a great time while building on a great set of standards of the past. Very well done, and I encourage any sailor, young or old, novice or expert, to view it and get ready to sell sailing to others!"
5,Dick Francis is Superb,Dead Cert and the other Dick Francis mysterys provides great insight into the racing aspects but provides colorful characters and excitment throughout. Dead Cert may have been his first but thank goodness it wasn't his last. Highly recommended to anyone that loves a great mystery with good characters and a solid story.
5,Bob Newhart is a Very Funny Guy,Bob Newhart is one of the funniest people alive. We have been laughing at his droll humor and perfect timing for forty years. His hilarious sketches are delivered with a superb talent and an almost inexplicable gift. His humor is honest and is not delivered at the expense of anyone. This book conveys a real sense of the stage performance that we all love.This is a very funny book.
3,Dead on Arrival,"After reading others' rave reviews, I eagerly placed an order for this Seagate external HD. I've been a happy prior customer of the Seagate 100gb portable HD, so I was hoping for the same experience with this unit. It wasn't to be, as both units were dead on arrival. No amount of connecting or reconnecting the power cord or pushing or continuing to push the power button would make it turn on.So why the 3 stars? Well, I'm giving Seagate the benefit of the doubt, as Amazon shipped both units in an over-sized box with just a loosely crumpled wad of packing paper. With sensitive electronic equipment like this, I would have expected it to be well packed in a mountain of packing peanuts. Although I'm an Amazon junkie, it looks like I'll be going to the local retailer for my hard drive purchase."
3,4 stars for the movie--0 stars for the price,"What am I missing? This is an enjoyable movie (and one that I unfortunately need to replace) but I couldn't believe that Turner Entertainment was charging $50.00 for a one disc release that is almost 10 years old. Is this because a new release is coming soon?It's good, but not that good. Doesn't make sense. I agree with the reviewers who say that this wasn't as dark as the real Hollywood at that time would have been. It's a Hollywood version of Hollywood. (Spoiler Alert) Everyone is basically decent--too decent. Even Kirk Douglas's character's motivation isn't personal power or greed, but creative outcome."
5,how to write a great film,"pay attention budding young screenwriters to films such as this and others from decades past . how did they manage to write great film with mature themes for general audiences ? they made it too smart for people of a certain age to be interested but conveyed all the same stuff a current film would need an R to achieve . this would earn a PG today . if that . but it's so good and worldly and honest . what happened to film like this ? they don't write like this any more and they seldom act this good . CGI . cable television . titillation . there's enough blame to go around . thank god for TCM and NETFLIX though . hey , i'm not exempt . i love much modern film and most of what i listed above and often disparage . these old films and their days are but a lovely reminder of a different time . perhaps i prefer to visit this era because i wasn't born yet ? perhaps it was just better ? some of both i think ."
4,Great Cast!,"With a cast like this and directed by Vincent Minelli, it would be impossible for this movie not to be good. Kirk Douglas plays a down and out producer in a trilogy of three short stories that come together. He makes a star out of a down on her luck Lana Turner, a Pulitzer Prize winning author out of Dick Powell, and an award winning director out of Barry Sullivan. Lana Turner has never been more appealing, nor has Dick Powell ever been more sardonic. Kirk Douglas always somewhat tends to overact, but he's wonderful here. Perfect strong leading man. Great supporting cast with Gilbert Roland, Water Pigeon, and Gloria Grahame. If you're a big fan of classic black and white movies, this will not disappoint you. It's hard to believe it's been over fifty years since this movie was made, but it isn't dated at all."
5,this is a feel-good movie!,"Movies today should be like this one. My husband has spoken for years about a movie he saw as a young boy. He ended up naming his sister for his parents as a tike because of this movie so for his birthday, it was a very special gift for me to give and for him to receive this DVD. We watched it his birthday night and LOVED it.Movies don't have to have the violence and dramatic special effects they have today, Lord knows there is too much stress and negativity in the world. It was great watching a movie that made you smile and yet had great character development, plot and dialogue. We loved seeing the former baseball greats in their heydey.I highly recommend this movie, it's a keeper and something you'll watch time and time again!"
4,worth wathing or renting,"a movie that trumps todays movies. It brings you back to a much simpler time. No worries about nudity, language, shootings."
1,You get what you pay for,"Without exaggeration, this game is the worst game I have every played.I feel taken advantage of. Game develops know that they are guaranteed a certain level of sales if they are able to license the Star Trek name and stories from Paramount. Bethesda has taken advantage of every single Star Trek fan out there by creating a steaming, unplayable turd of a game and calling it ""Star Trek.""Don't waste your hard-won earnings on this game like I did. I will never buy another game made by Bethesda ever again."
3,"Good, but hard","The initial missions are prettty hard, but once you get past them, they are pretty fun. Shatner's narration is a nice touch. It's good that they included all trek eras and numerous ships from each era. The controls take some getting used to but they work well once you do. Traveling through rings and warp conduits sucks. I found the Romulan ships the toughest. Each ship has its own different feel. Unfortunately though, many missions are tedious rather than challenging. But overall, the game is enjoyable and worthwhile."
5,Fantastic Service Outstanding product,"I have to say, you should feel comfortable doing work on the car, have good power tools, and not have a bumper that goes very low that you have to cut. You will probably need a helper.The product is very well built. the welds are solid, the coating looks durable. The customer service is top notch. I think it comes directly from the manufacturer in a very sturdy box."
5,PERFECT snack anytime,"Satisfying, healthy, convenient, not too sweet, nice chewy consistency, great flavor, good portion size, no high-fructose corn syrup or unnatural fats, WHOLE soybeans, real dried fruit, 4gm protein, won't melt - what is not to like? I've tried a lot of protein/snack bars. These are the best and have the most balanced nutrition. They are a perfect snack, at work or to keep in the car. All the flavors are wonderful. Check out their website for more info at soyjoy.com. Kudos to Amazon for selling them in bulk."
3,Insufficient Description,"I have no problem with the item, my problem is how the item is described. When your buying spark plugs for your car, they are bought in a set of (4,6 or 8) so when I saw Pack of 1 I bought it thinking it was Set of 1 meaning 4 spark plugs only to receive 1 spark plug. Please adjust the description, it will help to keep others from misunderstanding."
5,Great value compared to competitor,"Purchased a roof fan air vent by Camco. My husband was thrilled with the ease of securing it, the side air flow along with the rear. This product worked with Fantastic Fan which we were told would not. It is also $60 less than the competitor plus FREE SHIPPING! Thank you camco and Amazon"
2,Brilliant potential destroyed,This album would be great if it were not for the big band arrangements that back him up. What were these people thinking? It completely destroys the grit of this recording and is so typical of the Verve label.
4,A great toy for solar system fans,"My son is 5 and obsessed with the solar system. This toy is probably designed for older kids, but if you have an advanced preschooler or kindergartener, they will also enjoy it and it's a toy they can grow into. All in all, a good buy."
5,This book REALLY helped me.,"I recently got Izzy, my very first puppy. I read about 10 books in preparation for her, and this book really helped some it all up and explain so many things. Definately recommend this book to first time pet owners."
5,A solid reference for positive reinforcement training,"After getting a puppy in December, I picked up this book, hoping it would provide me with information on just what I needed to do to have a happy, healthy, well-trained dog. Happily, it does. Covering just about every aspect of dealing with a puppy, I've already started using some of the information in the book. The index is well organized as well, making it easy to look up information as necessary.Now, if only the puppy were as user friendly! *grin*"
3,Not my favorite Laura Fygi recording,"Laura is a superb vocalist. She has one of the most seductive voices I've heard since Julie London. But Michel Legrand's songs are mostly too cool and aloof for Laura's velvet voice. I've never been a fan of Legrand's music but I'm a big fan of Laura Fygi. Unfortunately, my worst fears were realized. She deserves better, more suitable material."
5,the best,i paid [...] bucks for this. used. from amazon. i listen to her music but got tired of listening to one of her cds over and over. so decided to go on a collecting spree and this one was one of the 4 that i ordered.
2,A good one to while away the time,"This is not a bad thriller, will keep you entertained. Nothing special, though, but not a disappointment, either. Of course, it's not Hitchcock, so don't expect any complexity there..."
4,i like this movie,i wanted it and i bought it. you should really consider giving the option of not answering an essay question.
5,good movie,"I liked this movie, but I'm giving it 5 stars becuz Katie Holmes is a fine piece of tail with a great body that she wonderfully displayed in this movie, and that is why I originally saw this flick in the first place. Keep takin them clothes off katie, you prized piece. Seriously this movie is real cool though in a What lies beneath type of way, but Evil Dead 2 is the Sam Raimi movie I own and love to watch, it's one of my favorite movies and it is so friggin funny."
3,OK movie with one big redeeming factor!,"The movie was very watchable ,but the best thing about it was seeing the lovely katie holmes topless! I recommend it even for just this reason!"
3,"Lovely movie, lousy predictable ending","Ms. Blanchett was wonderful, the story was lovely, but the ending and who turned out to be the murderer was just a huge disappointment.The actors, Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear, Swank, and Keanu Reeves were fabulous. So well-acted.I am so tired of not seeing Greg Kinnear get the best roles though. He deserves better roles Hollywood!"
2,"Bet you didn't see that coming!! Oh wait, you did...","I vaugely remember telling this story around the campfire back in my girlscout days. Didn't impress me much then, either. Remember when you watched 6th Sense, and you almost passed out from the ending? What a suprise! What a plot twist! What a perfect oppisite from this movie. I'll throw it an extra star due to the fact that the cinematography was nice. It's pretty hard to have a good movie with a cardboard plot, though."
5,Soothing balm for your soul!,"This album makes for a perfect comanion during dark autumn nights. Cuddle up, open a bottle of red and enjoy."
2,Booooooring,"Haden's bass playing is boring and predictable, totally uninspired. Metheny is just above average. If you're planning to buy sleeping tablets, don't. Buy this album instead."
3,"Sweet, sweet Cookie Dough... How sweet it is","One whiff after opening the cap, and you know this stuff will be sweet. Unfortunately, it's a little too sweet if you add it to your coffee in the same ratio as you do the other DaVinci syrups, but if you use any less, you can't taste it. Perhaps this flavor is better suited to dessert items than flavoring drinks? Some recipes for alternative uses would be nice (hint, hint!).p.s. it smells wonderful. like the cookie stand in the mall."
2,This kid is in first grade????,"I began truly loving this book. I thought the language was beautiful, the magic realism combined with mexican-american cultural practices was magnificent. I can't believe people thought it was boring! But, I do have to say I was repeatedly bothered by the fact that this was supposed to be a 6-7 year old boy having these enlightening thoughts and concerns. Come on, when you're six you're worried about the monster under the bed not the bigger ramifications of 2 sides of the family, older brothers destroying the dreams of their parents and what are the secrets of the universe! At least bring the kid up to 11 or 12 to make it semi-realistic. That really ruined it for me! and his bud Cico (sp?) he was supposed to be, like 8, and he was like a wise old guru spouting truths and gems of wisdom (In third grade!!)"
3,"Bless Me, Ultima","My book review is Bless Me, Ultima and it was a good book but long but once you start reading you wont stop reading. The book is about a kid named Antonio that he gets to know Ultima better and learns new stuff with her and that he sees a lot of people dead and that they talk about brujas and about Tenorio because he kills people and if you want to now more about the book you will have to read it because is so interesting so read the book if you are interested about Antonio crazy life."
1,A Shabby Book,"The book I received is a old, yellowed page paperback such as one might expect to obtain for 25 cents at a garage sale. Very disappointing and this seller falls way short of upholdingBless Me, UltimaAmazon's reputation."
4,Wonderful Book,A wonderful book that makes people really think about it long after they are finished with it. It makes people question thier religion and the importance/ value of thier lives. I would really recommend it to people who enjoy using thier brain.
4,This is a down to earth and true to life book!,"this is a truely wonderful book. Anaya displays the Hispanic culture wonderfuly. Antonio is a young hispanic boy that lives in New Mexico. Antonio has meny enteresting conflicts that take place during the book. One of the major conflicts was between him and his parents over what he is supose to do with his life. His mother wants him to be a piest, and his father wants him to live off of the land like his family did. One day an old woman named Ultima came to live her last few months with Antonio and his family. Ultima takes Antonio under her wing and shows him the ways of the curanderas. She teaches him about herbs and the spirits of the earth. she is the only person that knows what Antonio will become. All during this time he is having trouble with his faith in God. If you have not read this book it is a must read, if you have read it again!!!"
4,"read this book, it is a beauty","This is a lovely first novel from the very talanted Rudolfo Anaya, an upcoming Southwestern writer who teaches creative writing at the University of New Mexico. It is a mystical, NOT New Age journey through the troubled times of a young Nuevo Mejicano coming of age in Hispanic New Mexico. The characters are rich and likeable. The scenery is gorgeous. Read his subsequent books for a completely different aspect of his writing. This man is going somewhere"
1,I appreciate good literature. This is not good literature.,I hated this book. It's supersticious. You can't understand some of the pages because they are written in Spanish!! English teachers should not assign this.
4,It is well written,"After watching the movie first, I am glad I got the book. Goes into more detail. Books arrived as scheduled and in very good condition. Thank you and GOD bless you."
2,"Decent Theme, but highly flawed","I read Bless Me, Ultima for a summer reading and although I gave it a chance, I couldn't get into it. There is a nice story in here, but with half the dialogue in Spanish, it is hard to understand what is going on. I understand the need for authenticity, but for people like myself, who don't speak Spanish, this just cripples the story"
4,Excellent Book,Book was ordered for college. Came in good shape and I save a lot of money over buying a new one from the college book store.
3,A simple story of a young boy's religious struggle,"We purchased this book for my daughter's PreAP Summer Reading assignment. It was an easy read, but not a page turner. The story is written in autobiographical form as a man reflects on his life as a child during a time when old ways were slowly being replaced by new. Readers who have struggled with their religious beliefs will relate to this boys questions as he grows up. The book is sprinkled with Spanish phrases that make you feel like you are missing something if you do not know Spanish (you can use Google translator but it is inconvenient to do so throughout the book)."
4,Very light but fit fine,"I got this lid to go with a Nordic Ware stock pot, it fit just fine. It is a pretty thin material, I think it could have been a gauge or two thicker. The material is thinner than what is on Calphalon pots. It look nice but the rolled over edge could have been a little nicer, if the material were thicker it would not need to rolled over."
2,"Half good, half bad.","This item was 50% good, and I had to pay for the first side to get the second side, if I could throw away the first half of this album, I would, it has no attraction for me, and the second half is exactly what I wanted.Not exactly as I wanted."
1,So insulting to a great man,"I was given this as a joke present and a joke it shall remain. The author (...) portrait of General Grant is very disturbing, and I don't mean this in a good way. General Grant was a very heroic man and a very loving husband and father. Any book will confirm this, Miss Sauers portrays him as a sex-addicted rapist. I am offended to the core at this. He may have been sex-addicted, but in a good wat, with his own dear wife. This book is truly wretched, frightening, and an example of the worst form of writing. (...)"
4,Getting Started,I am about 3/4 of the way through the book and am looking forward to adopting the program. I like the the case study like examples. Explainations are easy to understand without a lot of technical terms. Easy reading and seems simple enough. Looking forward to putting it into practice.
2,Mens Gloves?,"I paid three times the price for these gloves compared to another pair because they were called ""MenScience"" gloves. I figured if they were for ""Men"" they would be a larger size. Not so. In fact they are smaller than the other pair I bought. These gloves are tiny. They stretch to fit to a certain degree. But they are way too tight on my hands. Don't be fooled by the ""Men"" label. I mean no disrespect for small folk, but these should be labeled ""LeprechaunScience"" gloves.I will be returning them.EDIT: 7/21 OK, I used the other gloves this morning. The ones that were larger than this brand. They too were small, but not as small. A tight fit on my hands, but they loosened up a bit when wet and soapy. I suppose the MenScience gloves would too. But still, they are not for big hands."
2,Grave Misunderstanding...,"I'm kind of mixed about this DVD. It wasn't all that scary for one. I think I have more of a problem the way it was filmed more than anything. I think they could have just filmed it like a straight documentary instead of the Booth brothers trying to show what cool editors they were and putting in rock music and child actors that were for effect only. And I really could not take those two guys with the berets seriously at all. I mean, what was that all about? It was laughable. The actual video, audio, and photo evidence that they had really was only about 20 minutes' worth. The rest was filler. In a nutshell, I was not impressed. The photo evidence and EVP's were cool, the sequence in the tunnel in the basement was awesome, but there just wasn't enough of this type of footage. It was paranormal sensationalism, Booth brothers style. I wouldn't say don't buy this, but I will say that I have seen much better."
3,Pros and Cons,"This is a really absorbent towel but it is also a little bit on the sticky side. It sticks to your skin a little bit instead of sliding across your skin like a traditional towel would. This makes it a bit awkward to use but practice helps. It rings out nicely. It is small (about 12"" x 15"") making it easy for me to pack in a backpack as I ride the bicycle in to work in the morning.(Edit) I have used it regularly for several months now. It has become smelly and musty. I am not very picky but it is a pretty strong odor. I have tried to clean it with dish soap and rinse it out thoroughly. And I have completely dried it out several times but as soon as it gets wet the small comes back. I will try it in the clothes washer next to see if that helps. I wonder if I can use vinegar or ammonia on it? Some of the color washed out when I used dish soap. Due to this I lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars."
2,speedp sports towel,"I bought this speedo sports towel for my son. He wanted the blue towel which was more expensive than the pink one advertised. It arrived the next day, and although small, it was bigger than some that I have seen.My big complaint and my sons too was that after two uses it turned WHITE. So much for paying extra for a blue one."
4,The Man of a Thousand Voices,"Peter was always the master of accents and character voices. His uncanny ability to "" hear "" and then translate almost any voice or dialect still has me in awe of his talent. This CD runs the gamut of his ability. The ""spiv"" musician ;Aunty Rotter- a marvellous take off of a childrens show host, his Shakespearean rendition of a Beatles' classic and of course the American travel commentator in Balham.""Unchained Melody "" with an appearance by Spike Milligan is The Goons all over again.The poignant, "" I Havent Told Her .."" shows another side again of Sellers character. If you are a fan you will thoroughly enjoy this album.The recording is excellent, very clear reproduction with none of the crackle and hiss you can experience with old recordings. I found it great study material for my Sellers impressions.YoursA Boy Scout from Finchley"
2,Electronics does not match Shirley Horn Acoustics,"A big production mistake. Ms.Horn with an electronic piano. Not even her sensitive singing has saved this CD from discomfort. Forget it. Like in baseball, why change the rules if the team has always been a winner? The great Shirley Horn is acoustics. And how great it is! Keep on browsing on Horn albums. Then listen to the samples and you'll know what I mean."
1,Strong rubberry smell,"The smells are terrible, It kind of very strong rubbery smell. I kind of afraid to use it, but It's not worth on returning it. So I would not want to recommend it to anybody."
4,Lots of Cowboy History,I enjoyed reading this book. I have been a Cowboys fan since the early 80's and the Danny White era. I was able to read the deep history of the team from the expansion in 1960 to the Superbowl runs of the 90s (although a large portion of the book is dedicated to the 60s and 70s). I am no critic but thought it was a very good long read. Mr. Golenbock explains the much talked about rivalry between the Cowboys and Redskins and why they love each other so much. That in itself was entertaining and surprising. A must read for any Cowboys fan in search of the history of their team.
4,Remastered? Yes. Restored? No!,"I'm among those who find it a joy to watch enhanced cleaned up episodes of Trek on DVD. The question is: does anthing ever get overlooked in a 'restoration'? ""The Menagerie Part I"" proves that it does - though it might take a trekker to spot it.Recall the scene on Talos IV when Spock finds those blue musical wind leaves and tests them out by holding them? In the original version, you hear the sharp contrast as the loudest of the eerie vibrations disappear abruptly, and then come back (in synch with Spock clasping and releasing the leaves).All that is lost in the transfer to DVD. The ""musical leaf"" sound track has been beautifully dubbed on in full Dolby Surround - but with no break! Spock plays with the leaves to no effect; and the whole point of that little scene has been remastered out of existence!Did anyone else notice?"
5,Wonderful,"The original series pilot, The Cage, was a so-so episode that was rightly rejected. The story has been enhanced considerably by wrapping it with a superior story involving Spock engaging in a seemingly unexplained act of sabotage.The Menagerie is a very tense, well-written episode that shouldn't be missed. It's one of the best."
1,Calypso Basics 7 quart enamel steel colander....,"Calypso Basics 7 Quart Enamel On Steel Colander, RedI ordered this in tuquise and recieved green and to top it all off it has sat empty on my kitchen counter since i recieved it about 3 weeks ago and is already rusting I will never order from this company again. It is a very poor quality product and I feel I have wasted my money!!!!!"
4,A Challenge,"I purchased this game for my 12 year old son, and he really enjoys playing it. According to him, it is challenging and fun."
3,Meh,"I am a fan, so I was willing to put up with a lot more than a casual gamer, but after 2 hours trying to make sense out of this game, I had to give up. It just isn't fun. Regardless of any issues, it's not fun, so why play?"
3,Too much sax........,"I love Roy Hargrove, but this is not one of my favorites. Too much extended saxophone solos. I loved track 6, Ballad For The Children, classic ballad style by Mr. Hargrove. All in all, I was a bit disappointed by the CD."
2,ok,"I've owned one of these for a while and not thrilled with it. The raviolis don't seal or separate well unless the pasta is fairly thick, which is not really appealing to me. I like to make very thin pasta for my ravioli - part of the appeal of making it myself. I'll be trying a mold next time."
1,Like Communism - Great on Paper,I bought it with high hopes. I think it makes the ravioli making process more difficult. I find it much easier to make them by hand in comparison to this attachment.
2,No character development!,"This book is great as a textbook; I learned a lot about Jews in India and the opium trade. However, the characters leave very, very much to be desired. The way Dinah Sassoon is just thrown from one situation to another without any character development whatsoever is very off-putting. At the end of 627 pages, I asked myself: how can I describe the main characters? And I couldn't. They are cardboard cutouts with no real personalities!Do not waste your time with this one unless you really want to know about Indian Jewry."
4,100% pure trash fun from 1981,"Kiddie killers movie that does everything other movies with psychopathic evil children don't.""The Bad Seed"" and""The Omen"" are great classic horror films,but Bloody Birthday is just silly fun.Total sleaze and cheeze flick.If your into the so bad it's good kinda movie.Then by all means pick this little piece of schlock up.Can't beat the cheap price here on Amazon.Worth every pennyfull of bad acting,cheesy unbelievable kills and gratuitous nudity. Also worth getting is ""The Pit"" another killer kiddie movie that shares all the same qualities as ""Bloody Birthday""."
4,Great Chilling Thriller of Kids Who Kill!!!,This movie is awesome... I watched for the 1st time since the early 80's and i still love it. Totally holds up today...
4,Fun killer kids flick,"Watching these kids kill was a bit disturbing at times. The naked ladies were beautiful. The story maintained my interest. The acting was fine. It's not spooky or scary or anything like the Omen, but more of a standard killer kids flick. If the kids don't like you or if you get in their way, watch out! Whether it's running people over, getting them with the shovel, through a peephole or more, they'll get you!Severin's DVD looks beautiful from the original negative. And if you don't like the film, at least check out that cover art!"
4,Great overview,"I did roughly half of the hikes in this book on a 5 day trip. The book definitly points out the spots worth visitng. My only complaint was that it didn't go into the level of detail I was hoping for. The maps are very rough and can sometimes be confusing. The elevation changes are not always on either. This book is great, but supplement it with another book on trails and a detailed relief park map."
5,The personality tree,I loved it it made me understand the people around me If you read it it will make a huge difference in how you treat other people
4,great gift,"I had already purchased the VHS and received the CD as a gift. This CD is a great addition to add to your collection if you are a Three Tenor's fan. The selections are mixed with pieces from various countries. However, the English selections I would have prefered Carreras and Domingo. I find Pavarotti not to be his best in this language.All three gave 100 % however, I would have enjoyed more individual performances than the program that was chosen.My favorite selections were Dormi O Bambino, Carol of the Drum, and Adeste Fideles. The John Lennon selection Happy Christmas/War is Over I have to get use to.Overall it is great holiday music to listen to when you cannot watch them on the VHS or DVD."
5,Wow!,"This is a teriffic CD! Even though I am a different religion from this, I still love the quality and the singing."
2,Don't waste your money,"Most great artist have recorded a ""stinker"" album and for the Three Tenors, this is the one. The album suffers from the lack of a good producer - someone to say ""Ah...guys, lets try that one again,"" and ""Do you really want to sing Winter Wonderland?"" There are sloppy entrances, one or two flat notes, and some really bad song choices. With all the great Christmas music available, why did anyone think that it was a good idea for these particular singers to sing ""Sleigh Ride?"" However, as another reviewer noted, their rendition is good for a giggle or two. Unless you are a completist, don't waste your money. Pavarotti and Domingo have both recorded wonderful Christmas albums. Buy those!"
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting so much more from this book. It seems to be overhyped by all the testimonials. The back of the book tells you what the book is about and everything in side seems to be nothing but research and proof on top of research and proof proving that people like ""likable"" people...really? I don't need 16 paragraphs out of 18 in a chapter to tell me that. Couldn't finish the book. Disappointed that I got it."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"I so resent hyper-critical reviews, and know I won't agree with them. I agree with them. I wanted so much from this book; it delivered so little. I admit there were one or two excellent sentences. Excellent. But the rest? I read it because I was so angry I'd spent the money.I know the author enjoyed writing it, but I am not a library file for a collection of footnoted proofs."
2,A disappointing follow-up,"The Killer App changed the way people did business. It was 5+ stars and a breath of fresh air.The Factor is a lame attempt to capitalize on Tim's good fortune with his first book. It reads like a 12-step program and I felt, the entire time, like I was reading about Tim justifying why they paid him to keep writing.Bottom line: read Killer App. Don't waste your time on the follow-up effort."
2,"Aptly named ""good poems,"" not great.","Poetry is such a highly personalized thing. Either a poem hits you where you live, or it doesn't. Yes, there were a few in this collection that I found illuminating, but three out of 295 pages is not exactly a reason to buy this book.If you are not familiar with Roger Housden's series of poetry compilations I would recommend them. He only includes ten poems, but he talks about each in a very down-to-earth, yet moving and spiritual way.I would also highly recommend Mary Oliver's work, and ""The Essential Rumi"" translated by Coleman Barks. Barks did not exactly translate these (he worked closely with the translator), but he is a poet himself and his take on these 13th century gems is really extraordinary."
2,Pseudo-intellectual,"I disagree strongly with the previous reviews of this book, and wish I hadn't bought it. I find the poems self-important and indulgent, without true depth or even much talent.Who wrote these reviews, the poets from the book?"
3,The SAP ABAP online documentation is at least as good,"Better than most of the published books on ABAP, but still not ""experience"" oriented. This is a plain ABAP/4 book that gives no more than what you can get from the SAP ABAP/4 online documentation. If you expect a connection to any of the SAP module, you will be disappointed."
3,Good but not Great...,"I recently purchased these to put on my car after a few instances of attempted theft. These decals get the job done, and are a good way to warn potential thieves that you have an alarm, without giving away the brand/make of your alarm (which can aid them in being able to disable the alarm eaisier). The only downside to these decals is that they do not stick inside your vehicle's windows, they have to be placed outside the vehicle, where weather wears them down, and people can peel them off."
4,My Thoughts about the F350 APS Camera,"I rank this camera a 4 star because of how its powered. I mean the CR2 Battery. This battery is a specail type of battery that is Lithium and it is moderatively expensive battery. By Moderatively expensive, it cost anwhere [price] depending on where your buy or order it from. The camera is GREAT although. If the battery was a standard i would have ranked this a 5 star!! By standard I mean (AAA,AA,C,D, 9 Volt, etc.)"
3,Just want to know the site for this book,"Hi, we are very much influenced by your manual at our company, Mahindra and Mahindra. Why don't you mail me the site address from where I can read it on line whenever required. Thank You ! yours Shrikant"
3,"Good, but not great","This is not a bad MP3 player for the money. The direction manual is not very good and the player itself is not well made. If you drop it, it will need repair."
2,Not Worth the 8 bucks,"Sharklight really sucks. It lights up the screen, but the reflection gets in the way. Plus you have to spend 8 dollars forit! Worm Light is much better."
1,Not worth the money,"At first glance this product seems like a good idea, however, in real world use it proves useless. The light does illuminate the screen but because it is so close it makes a ""hot spot"" on the screen. This hot spot impairs your ability to see the screen. Gamers would be better off buying a lamp."
1,Adult in South Carolina,"This product is really not worth the money. It doesn't help a whole lot during daytime car rides and it mainly just gets in the way. As others have said, it is annoyingly difficult to remove, doesn't fold down on the unit for storage, and the package did not state that it needed batteries. I bought it on the way out of town for a road trip and it was useless until I found batteries and then it was still useless. What a pain! I really wanted it to work well, but I've tried and it just isn't worth the money or the space to carry it around.Don't waste your money on this product. Get yourself some glasses and a real light!"
2,Nice idea but needs work,"I purchased one of these for my Game Boy Color and it worked great. This one has been redesigned and does not work. It lights up ok, just as good as the worm light I own but the magnifying glass makes the immage fuzzy. When playing games with small objects in them they are hard to see. This light is just like my light for GBC but worse. Dont buy this light wait for another company to come out with a magnifying light. Nintendo licenses one that is out only in Japan and it works great, I orderd it from a online company located in Japan. Nintendo does not have a release date yet for USA.This is an update to my review. Nintendo has recently releced its light to America. It is called the Light Boy. It is manufactured by a diffrent company but is licenced by Nintendo. You can buy it right here at Amazon.com"
1,Try again,"We purchased this in the hopes that the DVD player would be better than a refurbished pioneer we own. It was o.k. for a couple of days and then started stopping and stuttering with some dvds including some brand new ones. Also the response from the remote and the opening of the door were very slow. After a week of problems we decided it qualified as cheesy and sent it back for a refund. We have since bought a Panasonic, what an improvement. Don't waste your money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Like in many other reveiews here, my player will play a dvd for a bit over an hour then starts pixelating, stuttering and eventually freezes. I called Samsung and they made me add firmware which busted the whole player, then I had to return it to a repair shop in New Jersey. After waiting a few weeks I finally received the dvd player and began to watch a movie with my family. At the climax of the film (Meryl Streep dying in One Fine Thing) the movie started pixelating and eventually froze. My family looked at me like they were in shock!!I hate this player!!!!!"
4,Camera bag,This bag is well made and fits my Nikon D50 perfectly. The straps are fairly easy to adjust. It is comfortable to wear around the neck also.
3,I almost feel bad....,"Man, these guys are incredible musicians, but that doesn't stop this from being a little disappointing. I love blasting this in my car and i generally enjoyed this CD, but i was a little put off by the overall ""everything sounds the same"" feel of this. Alexi hasn't toned his vocals down which is a good thing and the instrumentation is still insanely accurate, but their ideas are on the down-swing. There is NOTHING wrong at all with being crushingly heavy, but when your band starts to play riffs resembling recycled Slayer guitar parts from ""God Hates Us All"", then you gotta start the search for fresh inspiration. Please don't let that deter you from at least listening to this CD once or a few times for a fair hearing because they really are amazing players."
1,SELL-OUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,theyb went from one of the most respected melodic death metal bands to another cheap metal-core hard-core imitation! they've lost alot of fans with this me being one! but i guess for every one metal head they loose they gain 500 little dooshy hardcore emo kids... i hope your happy cob cuz your just another bleeding through as i lay dying atreyu clone... it hurts me to even think of why you did this but hey what the heck right as long as your gettin paid more who cares right! as long as you can buy there cds and shirts at hot topic than it makes it ok i guess!if your on the same boat as me an your sad but still want more ol style bodom check out these bands!-Finntroll-Wintersun-Kalmah-Elvenking-Enisfernum
2,THIS IS NOT BLACK METAL!!,"IVE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THERE DEATH/BLACK METAL.....WELL THERE NOT! NOT THAT THEY SUCK(WICH ALOT OF TIMES THEY DO)COMPLETLY, BUT THEY DESPERATLEY TRY TO BE BLACK METAL. WHAT THE HELL R U GUYS DOIN?! THIS BAND IS TRUELY ANNOYING! I ONLY GAVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE ""IN YOUR FACE"" IS A DECENT SONG. I TRIED OPENING MY MIND TO THIS, BUT IT JUST REJECTS IT. DUMB,ANNOYING,LONG,ANNOYING....JUST DONT BUY IT! IF YOUR A FAN OF THIS [...],THEN I SUGGEST TRY LISTENING TO CRADLE OF FILTH. THEN TELL ME HOW ""KOOL"" CHILREN OF BBQ IS! COF IS A EXCELLENT BLACK METAL BAND! ALSO CHECK OUT EMPERER! LOOK AT MY OTHER REVIEWS FOR ^REAL^ BLACK METAL CDS!"
4,quote book,Great book for great quotes. Useful for public speaking when you need something to say and just can't find the right words. I've also given this book to several friends who were going through personal issues and wanted to read something encouraging and uplifting.
5,Best Techmaster PEB never released on cd,"This is the best Techmaster PEB never to be released on cd. ""Listen to the music"" is the title track that definitly rocks the house. Bass heads classic. I also like the track called ""Dragon Bass"" with the Bruce Lee clips thrown in. A great album that hopefully will be released on cd somday. DJThunder out!"
1,Maxtor...I mean Seagate is worthless!!!,"I purchased the 500GB one touch III about six weeks ago, and 2 days ago it produced the same problem everyone else is talking about. The only difference being that I can't even get the drive to power up now. I have purchased another drive of the same model, but to no avail so I returned it. The only options I have left are to send it back to Maxtor for one of their replacement drives and pay $1700 to have the files recovered, or I can crack the case and buy an external casing to put the SATA drive in. Obviously I am going to try the second option, but that means I run the risk of producing futher damge, and also void any warranty. This seems like a horrible place to be, and Seagate is in now way taking responsiblity for this obvious manufacturing defect. BTW, if anyone has suggestions on how to safely transfer a drive let me know....."
5,I love it!,"If you like Cole Porter and Ella Fitzagerald you'll probably enjoy this album as much as I do!I can imagine Nick and Nora Charles listening to this at one of Nick's favorite dives! It will transport you to a sophisticated time and place that may have never existed except in literature and debutante coming out parties.Gatsby would have loved it, and surely would have invited Ella to all his parties!This is my very favoite of all of Ella's albums. It's as if she had been created to sing Cole Porter's work, and Porter had been created just to write for Ella!If tis doesn't put you in the mood for love, I can't imagine what would!"
2,Can anyone spell 'Bland' ?,"I wish I hadn't purchased this. It's really a boring CD. No depth, no imagination, nothing new. The only thing going for it is the fact that it is a band full of girls in a male dominated heavy music scene.Apparently their 2nd full-length album is much more mature, but I haven't heard it.Don't bother with this one."
3,If you're in the mood...,"For a goofy time, pick up this disc. It's not that it's bad, it's just not very good. Weird gargling yowls and frantic whispers permeate the album. The band wabts you to know they're TOUGH! Just look at the pictures!Really, it's a nice reminder as to what a dork I was in high school."
1,Meow gone mad,"Maybe the reason for the band name is that the band had their cats play all of the instruments and randomly scratch shapes into the litterbox that they could convert into lyrics. Not to mention, they got their cats to fight for the vocals.Hey... it's possible... don't believe me? Buy this CD."
1,Terrible debut...,"Okay, kittie's latest album oracle sounds much better than this one.Now, kittie's sound is metalcore but spit was nu-metal and i hate nu-metal! I suggest you get oracle & skip spit that's all i can say...Laters!"
1,Ok Come On,"(...) Wow...what moving and thought provoking lyrics. This is just one of the most pathetic albums ever recorded. A bunch of angry canadian chicks who cant play their instruments, who would ever want to buy this. Kittie and bands of the like make nu-metal look even worse than it is."
2,Mediocre at best!,"This CD didn't annoy me enough to give it 1 star, as it didn't have any of that rap-rock garbage to deserve such scorn.Let me just make one thing clear: This isn't metal. It's a ""riot grrl band"" posing as a heavy metal band (because of its mainstreamity, people automatically call it metal. But that's the myth behind riot grrl music, it's basically a mockery of what they call the hard rock scene taken over by men.)What's already has been said has been covered (the one hit single is the stand-out, the rest of the songs reek. Many garage bands out there sound better than this.)An almost identical album is Babes in Toyland's ""Fontanelle"", which has MUCH better lyrics and was more thought out. If you want similiar, earlier music done better, get that album instead."
1,"Nails-on-a-blackboard bad, but makes an excellent coaster","The current trend of fresh out of secondary artists has brought forth some interesting new ""talent"". However, none of these can compare to the effort we see in Spit by Kittie.Screaming predictably foul-mouthed vocals highlight this recording. The four young members seem to delight in attempting to astonish. *very clever...wearing Hot Topic as well, I see* Maturity...forth-coming? Blech!On a better note, the CD itself has a lovely spiked collar design. It has found a place of honour...as a coaster."
4,Amazing ideas and possibilities found here...,"This book is filled with ideas that have been blossoming in my head since I read it a month ago. Science fiction, at its best, exposes the vulnerability of human ego while at the same time offering possibilities beyond our present way of being or thinking. Most of the stories did this, each through a unique setting or emotional perspective. The title story is so dark and sexy it deserves a soundtrack, and proposes a form of human gaming that seems allegorical to the relentless pursuit of image that actually goes on in popular culture. Even if you don't usually read short stories (which I don't), do not miss this anthology. It flows, and the subtle layers of the worlds it describes will inspire curiosity, and maybe optimism, about the one in which we live."
4,Darling! Finally on DVD!,"Absolutely happy with the DVD. Bare bones package, no ""special"" features beyond scene selection. Nicely done, even so. Good print, good balance between soundtrack and dialogue."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst children's games I ever played. There are caterpillars to move around, but they don't really go anywhere, and it's so simple that even my 3 year old is completely bored with it. Buy any other game but this one!"
1,I would rather play Candyland than this game.,"If I could give this game lower than one star I would. The game comes with a spinner that has the numbers 1-4 and then a moon. Every 4 spaces on the game board you have to stop. The moon is a lose a turn space. So there's a lot of spinning and not much counting because the players are constantly stopping. Some spaces you have to feed your caterpillar a certain type of food (fruit, picnic food, etc). At that point you spin to see how much food to give your caterpillar. This is confusing for kids because the spinner now is used for something other than movement. Near the end of the game you have to wait on a space until you spin a moon. Frustrating.Terrible game design - game designer tried to follow the plot of the book way too much, and as a result anything educational is lost.Save your money on this one."
5,Perfect countertop saver!,"An old time product that has a timeless function. I have two, and use them all the time to put hot pots n pans on, so that my nice Caesarstone countertop gets pampered! I only wish it were wider than 8 inches."
4,good product but could be more stiff,"The mat works well to protect the counter from hot plates and such, and the backing does indeed keep it from sliding around. I would have liked it to be a bit more stiff, since it arrived slightly bent in the middle. Perhaps if the shipper had used UPS instead of the USPS, it might have arrived more intact."
2,If You're A Hardcore Star Trek Fan...,"... you'll like this game. Granted it's not the best game in the world, but the graphics are alright. Most of the voice acting is good. Shatner seems to be half awake though. From a gamer perspective I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. From a Star Trek fan perspective, I would. It's alright, has it's faults, but it's alright."
4,A game for (almost) every trekkie!!!!,"The makers had a good idea, great story line... but nearly failed at controls and game play =(Some of the controls are great... however I seem to recall that at least 90% of torpedo's that WERE fired actually HIT their target!Also I would think that the ships would turn easier at low speeds then faster... Also the ships are over priced for what you get from them.Oh, and the 3d navigation is a pain, you can't just tell a ship to go to some spot up the Z-axis... they will go to the 'plain' to that spot (and then you have to move them the rest of the way to position them where you want to)...I would say rent this first and try it out to see how you like it. If you don't like it your only out $5+/-"
3,So So,"So So, had a hard time with the controls, and micro management of the game.Kinda of boring after a while."
1,Looked like fun but didn't last,Thought it would be like the playground balls we had as a kid. Pumped it up to the specified pressure on the ball and it bulged and then popped. Very disappointed in the product.
4,A good book,Is a good book to understand the pathways the brain has to undergoe when someone is learning to read. It also teaches you a lot of reading strategies.
5,Go raibh maith agat.,Very good little irish ditties.Go raibh maith agat.Glad we can still experience the native tongue.
3,Creepy more than anything,"This movie is based on a true story which makes it even more creepy. There is quite a bit of the super human movement which really freaks me out. I only rated the movie with 3 stars because it is a really quick movie and you only catch glimpes of those that have become his victims. The movie freaked me out only because of the fact that this really happened in Los Angeles and it could happen anywhere. Other than that I would not recommend the movie if you are into scary, gory this is more of a ""hey this is what happened awhile ago look"" I personally liked it because I like to watch real stories but I have seen better than this. The movie is just to quick"
1,Never sending my hubby to the video store again!!,"Oh. This movie is beyond bad. I just kept watching, hoping it would have one redeeming quality. Nope, never did. Please stay away, for your own good!"
1,the nightstalker movie review,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES ON A SERIAL KILLER THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE ONLY TRUE FACT ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT HE WAS A DRUG USER. WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE AN ART-SY STATEMENT, INSTEAD OF TELLING A TRUE STORY ABOUT SOME ONE LIKE THIS. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND RENT THE MADE-FOR-TV-MOVIE ""MANHUNT""."
1,Terrible !!!!!!!,"Thank goodness that I didn't buy this DVD. I was able to take it out of the library for free! This was the worst film about a serial killer that I have ever seen. That is if you can actually see whats happening on screen with some of the worst lighting in movie history. It appears that the director liked the FX from the film "" Jacobs Ladder"" so much that he decided to use it in every single scene. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Very Interesting treatment of the Night Stalker story,"Has little to do with the real history of the case, but the actor looks a LOT like RR. Voice not deep enough. RR did not kill Hispanics. The creative editing is very good. Music too modern. Killings were in the 80's. I liked it as a fantasy spin off on the Night Stalker legend. Amazon was great in quickly sending the product in good condition."
3,Surreal Kinetics,"If your looking for great interesting plot, its not its strength. What you get is psycho murders people-cops hunt-cops find-psycho goes to jail....But I felt that after seeing most of the current wave of serial killer DVD's out that this was one of the strongest. The camera work / editing was the star of the show. Even though we've seen bits of this style before, I found the wild, surreal kinetics to be truly entertaining. Yes if you liked the movies styles of Jacob's Ladder, Nat Born Killers, Spun & Requiem for a dream...you'll love this. Watch it for the editing, not for the storyline..... I bought my copy and am not unsatisfied at all."
2,Bummer.......,"Based on the true story of serial killer Robert Ramirez, Nightstalker falls way short of truly providing us the real accounts of Ramirez and his murder spree. Even with crazy special effects that make you wonder if there is something wrong with your DVD player, this movie is just plain weird. The acting isn't bad and I've seen much worse movies so that's the reason for my 2 star rating. I just wish this movie would have given us more details of the man himself. It fails to deliver a true story like movies such as Ted Bundy, Dahmer, Ed Gein and Gacy. I was disappointed with this film."
1,a future child psychologist from washington state.,i read this book when i was deciding what to major in when i go back to college. i had a foster brother w/ severe attachment disorder and holding therapy helped him. this book just explains the tip of the iceberg of child psychopathy. it is well informed for parents-but experts need more info. my uncle was a neighbor of ted bundy's. he remembers the warning signs being presented even back then.hopefully we can help more of these children before they grow up and ruin other people's lives-and their own.
5,None,"This book was full of anticipation and easy to read. It had the perfect blend of love, romance and comedy. I especially enjoy the family get togethers. Nora Roberts is a talented writer and I have enjoyed all her books. This is definitely worth a five star rating."
3,Good Read,"Fifth of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded Ukranian-American family.Book #5 starts a new generation in this lovely and loving family. There are no surprises here - even the drama at the end was easily anticipated - but engaging leads, with the author's usual bits of humor and strong supporting cast from previous books in the series make for a good story.Enjoy."
2,No Way!,i bought this item and it didnt work...what a load of junkmy son droped his GBA on carpet and the thing fell apart..didnt hurt the GBA any but just think about what would happen if he was to drop it on asphalt or cement <<<BROKEN>>> its ok for looks but it really (disappoints)
2,Wait until March 2003 for the remaster,"Save your money, wait a few weeks and order the bonus-packed, revelatory EMI remaster of this album. It's being supervised by a real fan. The two stars I rate the CD is not on the basis of the music (I'm sure I'll give the remaster a much higher rating), but the sound quality of the cut-rate Sony CD."
1,Misguided Philosophy,"Nobody should have to cope with deafness. Nobody should have to adjust. One reads of all the advances made in science and technology, particularly in fields of medicine and what advances have they made in deaf research in the last forty years? Nothing. So, instead of doing anything about it, so-called doctors just spend their time ripping off deaf people of their hard earned money while hearing aid manufacturers and retailers make a fortune selling junk that, while of some benefit to people who are hard-of-hearing, provide absolutely no help to the severely or profoundly deaf and closed caption companies charge [per] hour to caption programs on TV that are garbled half the time. And the author says ""cope with it."" A bad book that offers no hope for a better future. Save what little money you have left after blowing it on useless hearing gadgets, visits to the quacks, and garbled captions paid for by the federal government from your taxes."
1,Poor theology= bad book,"These books, along with the adult aimed ""Left Behind"" series, rely on poor theology and play on people's fears in order to make a lot of money for its authors. They provide a seriously flawed view of the end times by combining scriptures from different books of the Bible that are not meant to be together. In doing so, the transform the gospel message from one of love to one of fear. As previously stated, I fear that they are more concerned with Profits rather than Prophets."
5,Well executed inclusive version for use in worship,"This is an excellent resource for inclusive worship. While other translations / editions may be better for use in study, Oxford's The New Testament and Psalms - An Inclusive Version is invaluable to provide text for lectors in worship services where inclusivity is at issue. This Bible avoids exclusion of women and minorities, and clarifies concepts in terms which do not have the usual cultural impediments of western-centered language. Through all these efforts, the translators have done a competent job of holding fast to the original message.Every church which tries to do readings in a contemporary, inclusive spirit should have a copy of this Bible."
2,Terrible,"I was looking for a compact 35mm zoom camera, I wanted a camera to take the place of my clumsey Canon AE1. After some research I chose the Pentax 115G. After A trip to Europe I developed 20 rolls of film, boy was I disapointed with the results? I did not expect the clarity and quality that my AE1 would achieve, however the results were terrible. Out of focus and bad exposures were common. I returned the Pentax to my dealer and exchanged it for a Canon sureshot 120 classic. Now your talking fine picture quality, ease of use and superior features were normal for this unit, in fact I would go as far as to say the results were as good or better than my SLR."
3,Gets boring quick and is ONLY for younger kids,"This concept is good and the game can be fun but for a 3yr old who already knows their ABC's and 123's this was very boring very quick. I can't believe Amazon's recommended age was 4-7yrs old. I personally think anyone kindergarten or higher would be very bored with this one. GREAT for kids 2-4 yrs old though, of they are still learning their letters and numbers. Oh and be careful - those balls will bounce away and hide!!"
4,Kids love it!,"I think this is a good game for children, it also has good replay value. Every child that I have seen with this game seems to love it. Often they don't actually ""play"" the game by the rules but just sit quietly opening & closing doors, looking for balls so they can collect the treasure.One negative is the cards are a little flimsy & can get quickly damaged by young children. Also it doesn't take kids long to realize they can look at the game at a certain angle & see if the balls are under a certain door without even opening it. But those are minor complaints. I would recommend this game for young children."
1,fun for a while but save your money,"I bought this game because I heard it won so many educational awards, but actually, it is a boring game. It was fun for the first few plays then was set aside. I e-mailed Cranium to see if there were any different cards for the game board, maybe to shake things up a little. They told me they were making more but I have not seen a thing. Several months ago they e-mailed me and asked if we would like to be on a ""preview board"" for new cards, I responded but they have never replied. Save your money."
5,So glad we replaced this!,"We had this a few years ago for our now seven year old daughter and when we lost it, we were kinda sad, but she had out grown it a bit by then. Well enter new baby now almost two. We play a lot of games with our older kids (10 and seven) and so we wanted a game that the little one can play too. So glad we were able to replace this. She loves it and it is fun for the whole family to play something with the little one. So far we are only using the color cards, but she is getting the hang of it. Thanks Cariboo! I only wish this game wasn't cancelled!"
4,mom of autistic son,"I bought this for my 3 year old son and he really likes it,but my 5 year old autistic son absolutely loves it. Many autistic children love to open doors and he has already played it over 50 times this week. He already knows his colors, numbers, and letters, but he enjoys the excitement of finding the balls and getting the treasure. It works great for teaching autistic children turn taking and playing with others in an environment conducive to learning for them. Great Game!"
5,On the Beach - Great Work,"A lesser known work of Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins, Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck, but one that is well presented and underscores the fears associated with the Cold War / Nuclear Holocaust era. It provides hope (even in the midst of futility) that ""man"" will strive to survive and love will prevail. A great addition to any library."
5,On the Beach DVD,"This is one of my all time favorite classics, they don't make movies like this anymore."
1,On the Rocks,"Nothing is worse than Hollywood when it preaches. You half expect Al Gore to make a cameo appearance, wailing hysterically about ""climate change"". But I guess in 1959, he was sitting on his mom's lap, singing ""Look for the Union Label."" It's a shame to see so much talent go up in politically correct smoke."
2,HEAVY HANDED BUT HAUNTING IMAGES,Probably the most haunting of all movie beach scenes is in Stanly Kramer's heavy-handed 1959 anti-nuclear message movie in which a handful of characters await death via drifting radiation -- among them Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. A lone figure running down an otherwise empty Australian beach -- on what may be a humanless world -- is a hard image to shake. Escaping to the beach does not always guarantee a happy ending.
5,Superbly hilarious!,"And still one of the best date movies around.A boyish Bruce Willis coming off his emergence in ""Moonlighting"" fights off insanely obsessedex-boyfriend John Laroquette while dealing with stunning Kim Basssinger's ""alcohol allergy"" withhysterical results. The business meeting with the Japanese patron is classic Blake Edwards. Ifound myself laughing out loud throughout this kooky farce. Very funny.The DVD has both widescreen and standard, the transfer is pretty good, but the 2 channel dolbyis semi-hollow. Who cares, this movie is just pure fun! 5 Magnums"
1,very run of the mill Material,this film was a Extension of those Seagram Commercials.Bruce Willis&Kim Basinger together on screen won't make anyone forget Basinger&Mickey Rourke from 9 1/2 weeks.
1,"Awful, Awful Book!","Horrible, cliche-ridden. Probably entertaining for anyone under 21, but just really bad. And don't get me started on the horrid narrator in the Audio version. Every aspect of this woeful story rings false and forced. Not ""breezy."" Actually, the opposite of ""breezy"". The bad reviewers here said it better than I could. Trash."
1,Parents Not pleased,"My 5 yr. old daughter loves anything ballet. The DVD is great, she picked up on the movements in only a couple of days but the tutu is so small. She is very thin but tall but the age range says to age 8 so we figured it would work for her. No! She really wants to keep the thing but the tutu sticks straight up in the air. I have never seen a tutu like that. The company needs to rethink their design, it's like we are supposed to use these on dolls. If you have a one year old maybe it would be worth buying then."
1,"extra, extra, extra small!","Like the other reviewers, we purchased 2 of these for our daughters - 4 and 2 years old. It is even too small for my tiny, 23 pound 2 year-old!!!! What a rip off. When they put them on, the tutu skirt points directly upwards under their armpits and thir chests hang out above the top. They will be extremely upset when I have to return them as they were gifts from Santa Claus. The sizes DEFINATELY have to be redesigned. Great idea, poor product (Unless, of course, someone thinks their 1 year-old would appreciate a tutu!)"
2,Still Laughing.....,"My petite 4 yr old daughter received the tutu as a Christmas gift and LOVED it...until she tried it on. We laughed so hard that we embarrased her so. It was SO tight on her and the tutu itself stuck straight up in the air. I tried to exchange it at the store and found that they had no larger sizes, she was in tears! After reading some of the reviews, I am going to try contacting the company directly also. I would advise you to only purchase this for small girls under the age of 3. It is a very darling costume and my daughter is very anxious to get a new one that fits!!!"
1,Bella Dancerella Tutu,The material of the Tutu is VERY rough and scratchy. My daughter cannot wear it at all. The size also states for ages 2 - 4 and my daughter is a small 3 year old and the tutu is tight. Not the greatest - you could buy a real tutu for less money.
5,Great Bag,"I use for my camcorder and its accessories (1 extra battery, 3 tapes, charger, AV output). Still have more room in front pocket which you can put your controller there and extra memory storage. Have pen holder in front pocket. I put charger and battery in one side pocket and 2-3 extra tapes in another side."
2,a major disappointment after valerian,"I purchased this album on the strength of Valerian, which fatures Saiesse's talented piano in lots of good imaginative songwriting backed by solid bass and percussion played by actual live musicians. I wouldn't listen to Valerian every day, but every couple of months it sounds fresh again. In Next Voyage, Saisse continues a fine pianist, but this is drowned out by his garish programmed drums, and the fluidity of Saisse's song-writing (on Valerian) disappears into the monotony of his version of smooth jazz. Aargh - I'm selling this to the local record store for 50 cents, you can buy it there."
5,Smells so good,I wish they did a handbag size of this... Cause i take mine everywhere... My friend joke I am the only person they know that carries a whole bottle of perfume in thier bag.
4,"Gets rid of the smell, but not the best smelling cleaner","Luckily, I don't need to use this anymore. My cat finally stopped marking his territory now that he is fixed! This stuff does a great job at getting rid of the urine smell. Only thing I do not like is the smell of the cleaner. It isn't as bad as the cat pee, but it isn't great. You'll want a nice air freshener to go with it."
1,Dries to an OIL SHEEN on Laminate Flooring...!,"On 9/28/2010, I sprayed Urine Gone on an area in my laminate-floored hallway where one of my pups had an accident. I left it to dry for several hours. Later that evening, I fell at that spot and broke my tib and fib in my left leg and spent the next 36 days in the hospital (and rehab). I am now home in bed for further rehabilitation. I sill cannot put weight on my left leg for another six weeks.Please, please, please...warn against spraying it on laminate flooring. Urine Gone does NOT dry...it becomes an oil sheen. The instructions are not clear on this at all."
5,like no other,"This product works like no other product available at any pet store.It really emliminates dog urine odor on the rugs. Even after shampooing the rug it would still smell, but after I spray this product on my rug and let it sit overnigh and do it's magic I was amazed at the results, and I have tried alot of products (my dog has frequent accidents)."
5,This is the best biography ever!!!!,"""Gentle Annie"" is the best biography that I've ever read! If you want to get this, don't wait. It's the best for really sensitive people though. It touches people. It also makes them cry a bit, but in a good way. I loved this book."
3,Fine,The material presented was ok. I was looking for more illustrations along with the explanations. I will utilize the text merely as a quick reference if needed.
3,The creative process explored,"William Stafford and Marvin Bell, Segues (Godine, 1983)Marvin Bell and the late William Stafford, two of America's old guard of prizewinning poets, came up with an idea during a (boring, we infer) writer's conference to correspond in poems, using the last-received poem as the genesis of ideas for the present poem. It's something poets do quite often, but without the kind of structure and formality they were setting out. The result, after two years of correspondence, was the book Segues.It's a neat little package, and you can pick it up assuming that what's inside is going to be good writing; both poets have a solid track record of excellent work. But what's most interesting here is a chance to look at the way poems come to form, to look at an image Bell puts in as an aside that becomes the basis of a Stafford poem, and the tangents that poem sends Bell off on, etc. The fact that the poetry is quite good seems to be something of a sidelight, given that. ***"
2,"Not for 2"" or smaller walls","These are pretty simple, but they certainly won't work well on 1 1/2 to 2 inch walls. I have 2-inch walls on my office cubicle and these are loose and don't ""clip"" on at all. They just kind of sit there. They'll technically ""fit"" a 2-inch wall, but not snugly or securely as I would expect them to."
1,The worse quality ever for a timeless masterpiece,I have bought this dvd because I read other reviews and I understood that the quality of this edition was very good. This is one of my favourite movies and I was very unhappy with the original VHS I had. To my surprise I found out that the quality of the dvd was not better. The movie is presented in a letterbox format but the information that we are given (even on the dvd's case) is Widescreen!!! Try it on a good DLP projector and see yourself the difference... This is the worse quality I have ever seen. I don't know if I am more ungry with MGM or with the customers that wrote the reviews I read. If you are not able to appraise the real quality of a product do us a favour: keep your opinion for yourselves!
3,"Flimsy, but works","The tool tower rack is very easy to assemble and goes together in minutes. It is light duty with all plastic components and casters. It is not sturdy or well constructed, but it will hold several tools as long as it is stationary. Don't expect to fill it with tools and roll it around on the cheap casters."
4,Excellent!,This a perfect rack for small hand tools just as long as you don't overload it. And the casters lock in place so they don't roll around your garage.
2,Not as advertised,There are no castors included with the system making it useless except as a permanent storage rack. I am sorry I bought this. The first time Amazon has sold me a defective product.
2,"Weak and wobbly, over priced","The base sagged almost immediately from the weight of the garden tools; so much that the center touched the ground. The only solution was to toss the wheels in the trash and lay a 2x4 on the ground to support the base. Even with that modification it is still very wobbly when removing or replacing tools from the front clamps; need one hand to hold the rack and one for the shovel. Considering the poor design, this would be an okay deal at $30. But at $45 it's a bad value."
3,Minor Polanski,"Bitter Moon is minor Polanski, an overlong but enjoyable black comedy about sexual obsession. It's not particularly deep, but it is occasionally very funny (the poodle and the toaster are particular highlights), with Polanski constantly aware how close to comedy the sexual act is in all its more desperate variations. Perhaps its this sense of pervading black humor amid the emotional sadism that prevents the finale from having the sting it's aiming for, but it's an interesting voyage."
5,For adults only,"Two couples meet on a cruise ship, one British (Nigel and Fiona) and their relationship has become stale and mundane. The other has a history together of obsession and a mixture of love and hate. She (Mimi) is a beautiful French woman and he (Oscar) is an expatriate American. He's in a wheelchair and he tells the story about their relationship to Nigel.I was enthralled with the story. I thought it was erotic and frightening. This is not for children or teens. It's fascinating and repulsive at times but never boring."
4,Disturbing intrigue,The only question left at the end of this effective film's explicit emotional savagery is: who is cruelest?
4,"A disturbing, yet compulsive, film!","If you have ever felt you have been in a dysfunctional relationship, think again. The obsessive, sado-masachistic connection between the two main characters has to be seen to be believed. The lengths they go to to cause each other pain are positively frighteneing. It is well worth seeing though, if you are at all interested in films about relationships.The contrast between the relationships of the two couples is very clever and the additional spin of adding flashbacks to the film gives it that extra edge."
2,Only one redeeming feature,"The psychodrama in this movie was overblown to the point of boredom. It was difficult to care for any character other than the one played by Kristin Scott Thomas. Her performance, and a surprising twist near the end - which alone kept me from regretting seeing the entire film - brought the dark, ugly, unfunny movie up to two stars."
3,Worthwhile 3.5 Stars!,"While this modern adaptation of John Bunyan's classic does not follow its predecessor ""to the letter,"" it does an excellent job of presenting the meat of the Gospel. Though it was a little slow and some of the acting ""B"" rated, overall it was quite enjoyable. I would advise parents with children under the age of 11 to view the DVD first. There are a few small portions that might not be favorable for some kids. I rate it 3.5 stars. Many blessings!"
1,Simply a bad movie,"I consider myself a strong Christian, and I love to see people come to know the Lord. So bear in mind that my bias is towards Christian movies.That said, I cannot recommend this movie.It is boring and repetitive. The sets are terrible. The costumes are terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is bad. There is simply no good reason to see this movie. Do not waste your money.Thanks and God bless."
4,The Pilgrim's Progress in 21st Century Dress,"This is a wonderful film of the timeless John Bunyan classic and a powerful witness to Jesus Christ and the Christian faith. It surpasses in quality the Ken Anderson 1979 films ""Pilgrim's Progress"" and ""Christiana,"" since the budget was proportionately higher, no doubt. Because I like period costuming I was a little disappointed, but the contemporary clothing and dialogue will ensure a larger audience and deliver a greater impact. Because of my love for this book I am still hoping that a film maker would simply follow the book more painstakingly as the film makers of the Harry Potter series did for those movies. I guess it all depends on the number of people who have read it! I urge anyone to see this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,A drama poem with scenes from nature,"The Holy Mountain is considered one of the best Bergfilms (mountain movies) ever, and the final scene ""His world"", in which we see the allucination of the protagonist, as he dies up high on a mountain, is an absolute masterpiece. The movie is interesting for several reasons. The dancing of Leni Riefenstahl, the new music of Aljoscha Zimmermann (a real pity the original soundtrack of Edmund Meisel has been lost), the experimentation with blue light, and the gorgeous images from the Alps. It is somewhat interesting to note that the initial dance scene (Diotima on the sea) had originally been thought for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, something almost impossible to fathom."
3,Dry But Informative,"This book is a very dry read. Don't read it if you're not willing to work to stay focused and awake. Even though it isn't entertaining, it is very informative. It has some ideas for lessons, activities and is very useful for new teachers."
4,A joyful noise,This Gospel album is wonderful. It sure is an INSPIRATIONAL recording. I'm no expert on Gospel music but this recording takes me away. Lifts me up. The world sure needs that lifting up right now. I hope lots of people listen to it. It could help.One nit to pick is I couldn't figure out from the liner notes who was doing what. I would enjoy knowing.
4,Just what I was looking for..,"This printer is a convenient size for someone with limited desk space or for taking it with you when traveling. The battery pak mentioned that can be used with this printer is available through DELL. It may take a bit of searching to find it. Click on Printers, then look for the Canon BJC-85, then click on more details under the printer icon, then related products on the next screen. It does not state for BJC-85 but it is the correct battery pack or ask Dell for reassurance, I did! I have been very pleased with the print quality of such a small printer, even the graphics are great. For Word Processing that requires mostly black ink, use the large BCI-10 Ink Cartridge it is better than the small black tank you use with color printing. I have not been able to locate the Infrared Driver for it does anyone know where that can be acquired? I am more than pleased with this quality and size of this printer."
3,Poor paper feed,"I have owned BJC 70 and BJC 80. Both have difficulty feeding automatically. I have had to guide each single piece of paper in order for the feed to catch.I have also gone through a power supply. Currently my power button is not operating and cannot turn on.I paid the high price of $300 for dependabilty thinking that it was reliable but the variety of mechanical failures have caused me to look for another brand name. I do love the portability design, but I guess design does not equate with dependability."
5,Super game!,"My college-age daughter wanted this for Christmas and it was hard to find at a reasonable cost-- had to order from ENgland but that weas NOT a problem. Quick shipping, no hassle and the game is really super. A great mind workout."
4,"Great game but beware this is the first edition, not the pictured second edition.","I'm a big fan of board games, and specially of Ricochet Robots, and have played it since the first edition years back.Got a hold of the second edition (with gates) and like it very much, so was going to get a few copies for my friends/family. The picture in here is of the 2nd edition (blue box) but the actual product sold is of the 1st edition (maroon box), so it's not a big deal, but something to note since the gates makes a big difference to the play!Still, fabulous game, one of my favorites of all time. For a detailed game review go to http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51"
3,very average,"If you're only going to take your GBA and a couple of games, this case will work, but if that's all you're taking, why do you need a case at all? A GBA with a light shield just barely fits into the zipper part of the bag. Toss a couple of games and some spare batteries into the front pouch and the thing is pretty much full. Plus, it looks too much like a purse. It even comes with a long shoulder string."
5,The must have thing for Gba owner ...,This is great ! I have my own gba (+ 2 game + a protactive light + 4 Energiser e2 betteries)and the ALL fit in it ... Well a little trouble to ge it in but when you let it in for 1 day or so the case is the great size for that stuff !!!!!MUST HAVE !!!!!
5,THE ULTIMATE CASE FOR GBA,"This GBA case is excellent!!!!! It fits eight of my games, a worm light or glow guard predictive light, adapter set, booklets, and the 1# handheld game console in the world GAMEBOY ADVANCE. When i first got my GBA from toysrus it came with a free sholder carring case but i do not recommend that unless you only plan to buy Three GBA games and no accseceries lights or adapters. The best thing is about is the convienient size to carry around with you. I plan on bringing this GBA case with me to penn. dutch for a trip and I Know it will be great for the boring long ride to get there. If you do not but this i know you will regret in the future."
5,A gift for my sister,My dear little sister loves MK and A and now wants to share them with her daughter. DVD's arrived in stated condition and the express option I chose arrived on time.
3,A little disapointed,"I am an avid reader of Wilbur Smith's but found this book to be one of his worst. it did not have me turning the pages as quickly as some of his other books. This book felt more like a history lesson than a compelling wilbur smith adventure novel. He is mister entertainment when it comes to adventure writing but seems to get the reader caught up in a nations struggle with inequality and the various issues asssociated with it than encapsulating the reader with a trade mark concorde story line.Things go too slow and the characters are developed at times too slow and at times with too much depth. This is a well written book with a great deal of history in it, however, if you started reading this book you will find it still sitting around you some weeks later. That is because it doesn't have the necessary elements to be a complete page turner."
2,Not worth the price,My daughter got this for Christmas last year. It worked okay at first but then the string got stuck and the beads jammed. It makes a lot of noise. It's much easier to string the beads yourself.

3,funny whining,"As has been pointed out by everyone else,Mr. Bryson whines and complains through thewhole book. BUT, it still has a lot of laughout loud moments, getting me strange looks fromeveryone several places where I happened to be reading it."
3,Unhappy traveler,"This was a trip the author could have missed. He finds mostly small ugly towns without good motels, surly waittresses and mediocre meals. On the way he seems to somehow miss towns in the area that are unique and well rounded.I got tired of reading about his misfortunes and rude treatment. This should have been a short story. JEF"
4,Brilliant!,"If you have spent time travelling within the states and also travelled abroad, you will probably love this book. To truly appreciate it, you need to have the perspective that comes from having spent some amount of time outside the good old USA. Bill Bryson has the incredible knack of being able to put into words many of the thoughts that go racing through my mind when encountering some bizarre bit of Americana. I must admit to laughing so hard that I cried, then re-reading the same passage with the same results."
5,Why I love to travel in the U.S.,Mr. Bryson confirmed for me a lot of things I had suspected ! I love to travel in the U.S. and this book has made me look at the country and it's inhabitants in quite a different way.What a joy to read !It has greatly influenced the way I write my own trip-reports.Love to see his articles in National Geographic Magazine.As a part-time Anglophile I enjoyed his 'Notes From A Small Island' as wel
1,Bill Bryson finally fizzles and sputters out,"I am a fan of Bill Bryson. I simply loved his Short History of Nearly Everything and In a Sunburned Country. Just awesome stuff. Reread both several times. I liked several other of his travel books, as well.But this...this is just...bad. I mean seriously bad. He makes fun of darned near everything from his youth from his family on, and not in a funny, teasing, but affectionate way like Gene Shepherd had the sense and talent to do, but in a really nasty and distateful way. And it's just not funny. Nasty satire can be a guilty pleasure...like the old National Lampoon magazine managed from time to time (remember the Teddy Kennedy Volkswagon ad?), but this stuff is just...bad and boring.I guess Mr. Bryson is just not talented as I thought, and hoped, he was."
1,Don't spend the money,"I couldn't get past the first few pages and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews of this mean spirited, pompous, derogatory spew from this writer before spending my money. With the daily partisan hatred being flung from the halls of Congress, I didn't need to read it when I was trying to ""unwind"" with what was falsely marketed as a ""hilarious account of one man's rediscovery of America."" Hilarious?? Rediscovery of America?? Nothing funny about it. Go back to England, Mr. Bryson!"
2,Disappointing,"After spending most of my life seeing the rest of the world, I just completed a spectacular 11-month drive on the two-lane roads of America. Although I agree there are plenty of warts, such as fast-food restaurants in embarrassing numbers, I chalked those up to ""progress"" in a country that is otherwise truly magnificent, and I'll never stop being grateful that it's mine. Am just glad I didn't depend on Bryson's opinion before the trip, or I'd never have realized the dream of a lifetime! His writing style is clever and witty - too bad America-bashing is how he employs it."
1,Are you really from here??,"Bill Bryson could be a fine writer if he wasnt so enamored with himself. While going on a 36 state trip for most people would be exciting and fun, Bryson makes it out to be the most boring and inane trip of all time. If he had spent a little more time telling us about the wonderful places he visited instead of the many way he can find them unappealing, he would have a fine book. I think he lived in the UK far too long.Not only was this book a waste of time, it was a waste of his."
1,Agree with rockgeek56,"I got this book after greatly enjoying ""A Walk in the Woods."" I had been so interested with that book I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail!This book was just the opposite. Bryson provides a disappointing description of his travels around the United States, picking on most of the places he visits by highlighting their lowlights."
4,"funny, funny, funny",not a review really but when Bill reprints could he possibly insert a MAP!! Living in Australia and not knowing the U.S. well I had to keep running into the office where we have a large map on the wall 0- exhausting. but loved the book he can travel anywhere with me!
2,A poorly planned journey,"This travel journal had such good potential but Mr. Bryson blew it. He timed his destinations in seasons of bad weather and missed so many opportunities. I did enjoy his anecdotes of traveling with his family during his childhood. I suggest, now that he is older, another road trip. Only this time consult an almanac so he can see things that are not covered in fog, snow, and sleet. I have enjoyed other books of his but cannot recommend this one. He comes across as sour and unfair in some of his critical commentary."
1,Mean spirited review of Americans,"I thought this had great potential to be an extremely entertaining book. Mr. Bryson however has spent too much time in England away from his beloved Midwest. He was right that the people in the Midwest are the most hospitable that you can meet, however each state has wonderful people if you are a wonderful person. His view on America and Americans was funny at times but mostly just mean and vindictive when he didn't feel his was treated to even his low standards."
3,Funny and harsh,"Bill Bryson is rather un-patriotic, which is real fun and a real pain to those who think that the States are the most beautiful, exciting and grandiose country in the world. Well, they aren't. They can be downright boring and ridiculous and tacky; as tacky as it can get. Bryson is a sarcastic travel writer, enriched by his European experience that few Americans can grasp. A very entertaining book, harsh on the American Way of Life small-town version."
