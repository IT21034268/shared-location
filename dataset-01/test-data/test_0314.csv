4,mighty mite,i purchased this for two reasons. it is small so is easy to store and light weight to use.i was pleased to find that it has excellent suction. it is just a plain little plastic machinebut really does a good job.
3,"Eureka Mighty Mite, about as expected","I find the Eureka Mighty Mite easy to handle, as desired/wanted in a compact tank vacuum cleaner. This was as expected and I plan to ""keep it"", in fact I ordered a pack of replacement bags.The hose and tools are clearly economy quality, I'll share the better tools I have from a full size tank vacuum to extend the usefulness of the Mighty Mite.I find the air relief at the top of the hose handle problematic. I normally want to operate the vacuum at full suction, and the relief port twists too easily when handling the hose to carry out cleaning operations.I gave the unit only 3 stars because of the lower quality of the touch-and-feel of the machine. But, given the low cost it may deserve a higher score, at least a 4 star."
2,I hate it,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum. I hate this vacuum and here is why: It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic, cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction. The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air. The body is cheap plastic. The unit is difficult to manuever, the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog, 2 cats, a baby, hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it. I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully. I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
4,good power,I bought this vacuum to do my stairs and bare floors. I needed something small and light. I was very surprised at the power. It lifts my small rugs up off the floor. The only thing that I didn't like was the vacuum head has no adjustments. Lucky for me all the attachments from my old Eureka canister fit this one also.So now I have a easier to handle more powerful vacuum with all of the great attachments from my old model. I'm very pleased.
5,Like this loud little sucker!,"This is an excellent vac. for hard floors, upholstery, and moulding. However, it is LOUD. That's not a deal-breaker, just a fact. The company should devise a muffler for it, but I would definitely buy it again. It uses disposable bags which I prefer so I know that the dirt actually left my house."
4,Mighty Mite is great!!,"This is the lightweight vacuuming solution I've been looking for. It's very easy to use and the attachments are great for fabrics. The canister might be a bit small, but not small enough to outweigh my giving it a good review."
3,Vacuum Cleaner,I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs.
4,Small and Powerful. Light and easy to stow away.,"This is the 2nd Might Mite I have purchased. The first was about 30 years ago and it still works! But the old one seemed kinda tired so now I just use it for the car. This new one is great. No frills, lots of suction. And a great value! It is a little louder than the last floor vacuum I had (A sears vacuum). But I like it and it is more maneuverable than the last Sears cannister model I had.I looked at more expensive models at vacuum stores, but this was such a good deal and works great."
1,No Frills but more than functional (update),"In the past three years we've owned a dyson, a dirt devil and a shark. Our children broke two of them and I short circuited the last one.We waited two months before getting a replacement and settled on this one. The Mighty Mite does work wonderfully on wood floors and couches... this thing will NOT do carpets to save its life. Its a no frills connection, nothing to clip in place and nothing for the kids to break... I vacuumed under our couch and had to reconnect the floor brush three times.This is light weight going up and down the stairs but the plug is so short, you have to unplug/replug on a standard stair case.The attachments stay securely on the vacuum and the hose is adequately long enough to do ceilings and walls.Very basic vacuum but it does a good job.UPDATE-The vacuum DIED on Day three. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't budge."
5,Love the MIghty Mite,I've had my Mighty Mite for 3 months now. Love it! It is light weight and easy to use but it has a lot of suction. The on-board tools are really handy. The floor took looks a bit silly - like cheap plastic - but it works great on hard surface floors. Haven't tried it on carpeting so I can't comment on that.
1,Weak suction,"This one has surprisingly weak suction. I have no idea how it can be used for cleaning. I am really surprised, that this ""cleaner"" has such a big rating. The only explanation: the reviewers have never used vacuum cleaners before. I was very disappointed and got rid of this thing in two weeks. I want to warn everybody: suction power is not the same as engine power. Make a hole in the hose and engine power will mean nothing. We've purchased another canister vacuum with exactly the same engine power, but the difference in suction is tremendous."
4,Great shop vac,"I purchased this as a classroom vacuum, but ended up using it in the art studio. It's light, powerful, and gets the job done. I would have given it 5 stars if the hose were better quality -- it's thin and cheap and twists easily -- I can't see it lasting long at all."
5,proglaze pro or con,"This stuff works great, It removes oxidation, scratches and swirls prior to a wax application. Can't live with out this product"
4,Bad Karma,I enjoyed this book and ordered the next one in the series; however it had several typos so it must not have been edited very well.
4,good even without the images,a little pricey for uk subscribers as there is no picture content. overall though works well
2,Impossible to navigate,"Kindle version seems to include only section headings, not a sub-menu for articles. This makes it impossible to navigate efficiently - a big time-waster. Don't bother with the Kindle version until they fix this!"
2,Hunger season 2,I didn't care for this season. When I saw it on my recommended dvd list I mistook it for something comparable to True Blood. It's more of another take on The Hitchhiker or Tales from the crypt with a sexual twist. The storylines were too wierd for my taste.
2,A little disappointing,"I expected this book to more of a way to address postmoderns with the truth of the Gospel. However, the author takes more of a stance against postmodernism and the Church's way to push back. I recognize some questionable issues with postmodernism and some things the Church simply cannot stand for, but most people listening to sermons ate going to have some postmodern sensibilities and pastors should be prepared to connect with people in this way. I would not recommend this book as a way to address how to positively preach in a postmodern context."
1,"Thanks be to the gods, I didn't buy this","If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Thankfully I had the opportunity to read a friend's copy of this book so I lost only my time and not my money.First, there is nothing intellectual or substantial about this book. It amounts to nothing more than Coulter bad-mouthing liberals, ranting about how they are vermin and evil at every opportunity."
1,Stupid book,"I read this over a lunch hour in the local bookstore's cafe, wanting to see what this ""church of liberalism"" was about. What do I find instead but a long-winded, purposeless rant about fellow Americans which uses endless amounts of humorless vitriol that fails to engage the reader in any shape or fashion.[..] for this trash? Once my meal was done, this book was returned to the stand, and I purchased my other selections instead. What a waste of printing paper."
4,Snarky! A fun read!,"I enjoyed this book, it was entertaining and witty. The logic was impeccable. I felt the book was a breath of fresh air."
3,"Entertaining & Political, but Edgy & Insulting, too","When I finished this book, I wondered how Coulter avoided being sued for many of the libelous things I found within. But, having heard her speak, I think her satirical wit has enabled her to get away with such things.I must say, I did enjoy most of this book, though there were some slow parts. I do agree with her political and religious perspective, so in that sense, I was more likely to put up with her vilification of the Liberal Left. I think most liberals would 1-star this book in a heartbeat... but from my perspective she's spot on about so many issues that it's hard not to give her credit. I just wish she would have toned things down a wee bit.By the way, I actually don't relish the thought of Richard Dawkins burning in hell. Rather, I pray for him regularly..."
1,What A Real Liberal Had to Say,"Speaking about McCarthyism, Adlai Stevenson, an actual liberal (as opposed to the imaginary ones who are the ""straw men"" in this book) said the following: ""When demagoguery and deceit become a national political movement, we Americans are in trouble; not just Democrats, but all of us.""Ann Coulter's purported witticisms (they aren't funny) are based on non-facts that she is too bright to believe are true. She appeals to her readers' fears and prejudices and inspires them to engage in group-think (otherwise known as ""mob-think""). As Stevenson pointed out, such tactics endanger not just the their targets, but everyone. Ann's books may be gratifying to the ignorant and hilarious to the cynical, but they do harm. She should know better, but obviously does not. It's up to the rest of us to make the difference."
1,Another ego trip.,"Coulter is off on another ego trip. When whacko's can write a book and have it be a best seller something must be wrong. This book is like watching an accident, it's hypnotic in its absurdity....Coulter must have something wrong with her; nobody can be that bitter without having had a bad experience. Did you ever notice that every book she writes has herself on the cover? And now some are saying she plagarized; I don't believe it nobody else could be this ridiculous! Wow."
1,I quite like being godless,"Having been raised Baptist, I enjoy not having to worry about what some anthropomorphic celestial father figure thinks of me, my life, or what I think of Ms. CoulterWhat is a god anyway? It's basically a social construct erected to give purpose and meaning to culture. It's also unique in that every one of these cultures believes they are of Divine sacredness. Muslim fundamentalists believe that the creator of the universe wants nothing more than to have a young man strap explosives to himself and blow himself up and kill innocents. Zionist Shohets and Rabbis believe that the architect of existence is something of an ""omniscient real estate broker"" who promised the land of Israel to them. And American Christian psychos like Ms. Coulter seem to believe that white Republicans with money are God's chosen people.Of course, Ann is a master at baiting fuel for her fires. She lives off of reactions to her work, mainly the negative ones. Best to ignore her and maybe she'll go away."
1,trash,"this is the worst book i have ever read. she spreads nothing but hate for people who do not think the way she doesm, and doesn't offers any ideas for compromising between the two parties. This is the last thing we need in our politics today."
1,No merit,"Even if you agree with the politics, the book is written in poor taste and clearly out of frustration and anger. There are so many poinant books and articles written about the state of affairs in this country from a conservative view point that anyone looking for insight will be greatly dissapointed by this. It's not worth buying just for the controversy. You're better off saving your money for gas."
1,"So much hatred, so little brains...","I wonder why some people in this country who claim to be such good Christians have no problem with our government slaughtering thousands of families? If the church of liberalism is godless, then what would you call a government who has done just that? Invaded another country for its own personal gain? I just can't help but wonder what makes Ann Coulter tick, that her vision is so clearly focused in one direction while totally ignoring the sins of her own. I am reminded of the Bible passage that talks about removing the log from one's own eye before attempting to remove the speck from a brothers. These kind of books will do nothing more than to continue to polorize this country, other than making her more money from idiots who cheer her on."
4,Bullseye!,"Ann once again says the things that flat-out needed to be said, and she is in top form while doing so. Her over the top, sarcastic style will have some howling with laughter and nodding in agreement, while infuriating others. The final chapter went on just a little too long, or this book would be a definite five star rated book."
4,"A bit shrill, but...","Ann Coulter is perhaps one of the smartest and most thoughtful women in public life. Her acerbic wit has amused me and her solid research informed me through all her previous works. Godless, while full of the inconvenient facts liberals love to forget, is too strident in places, particularly with reference to the widows of the 9/11 victims. While her points are valid, it is difficult to excuse ""I have never seen anyone enjoy their husbands's deaths so much"" as wit or exposition.The chapters on Willy Horton and abortion however are worth the price and time the book requires."
3,[...],"[...]I read the book, and, though I am in agreement with the majority of Ann's positions, I found it too ""over the top"" for my taste, and frankly, not always well written. It does reflect her speaking style, so if you enjoy hearing her rapid-fire-contiguous-sentence answers in interviews, then you will probably enjoy this as well. But, for me, I really don't see the overall purpose for the book."
1,We are all one,"Lacking any concept or insight into a real sense of spiritual developement....without genuine inspiration or understanding....meaningless soundbites of dogmatic irrelevance...self pleasuring for the emotionally retarded. Without any redeeming social value...without pretense of any intellectual development....yet Ann is a part of the shadow within us all, an inner questioning of what is real and what is illusion; a tenuous grip on reality that is so hard to define in a culture of irrelevance. This is pure entertainment masquerading as high cultural, even spiritual dominance! Ann seems to forget her humility and connection to the oneness that inspires Truth. But i forgive her insanity and invite her to redeem herself by including everyone, without judgement, as equally important aspects of the creator when she writes her new book: I am born again into the Human Race."
5,Godless: The Church of Liberalisn,The book was a gift for my husband. He is a loyal Ann Coulter fan and has read all her books. He enjoyed the book very much.
1,OMFG,"I seen her on TV many times but never imagined she was this nuts - TV of course is censored. This LITERALLY reminds me of Mein Kempf.This book is hilarious though if you hate her, just read the excerpts."
1,"It's about the WRITING, people!!!!!!","I really, really tried to read this book. It's a meandering long winded run-on sentence filled essay that leaves the reader exhausted. Whatever your political position, trying to sog through Ms Coulter's work is like trying to decipher gibberish.She's simply NOT a decent writer...maybe her hate clouds her ability, I don't know."
1,Anyone ever heard of separation of church and state?,"This is hate literature at its absolute basest much like everything Ann Coulter spews.It's a sad, sad state when right wingers think they are correct and anyone who has a mind of their own is somehow lower or evil. A dialogue is no longer tolerated but smashed down brutally with childish insults and name calling.Liberals have never insisted on the abolition of religion - we just don't want it shoved down our throats. Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe in the separation of church and state - they want to to force EVERYONE to accept their version of religion and politics and it you don't you are considered unpatriotic.There used to be a room for opposing views in this country but Republicans are facist and are right around the corner from breaking out the train cars and carting Liberals to concentration camps.Buy this book on the shelves right beside Mein Kampf."
1,A sad time,What a sad time for our country when character assassinations and pure hate can be printed in a book and scooped up by its citizens. It only serves to divide us a nation even more than we already are. What will become of us if we continue to give people like this author the opportunity to use such hideous marketing ploys to make her fortune at the expense of all of us.
1,Ironic Marketing?,"Am I the only one who sees the irony of this woman using her 'assumed' sex appeal to sell her books? Obviously she sees the value of using her looks and body to sell books....how very democratic. I am sorry that we americans have a need to to show support for such a vapid and hate-mongering individual. I do believe in free speech and I am not a Democrat, per se, but I can't support someone that appears to talk out of both sides of her mouth. Wouldn't the world be a better place if we found a way to all get along, accept people as they are, and put books into the hands of our students instead of guns. I would find it astonishing to think that Ann Coulter would support this."
3,"Perish all ye ""Godless Conservatives""!","I've been enamored of Ann since I saw her on H+c's and had read her two previous books. Was so looking forward to the release of this one. Bought, read, groaned and nearly cried at her rejection of reason in her creationist fugue. It leaves me in awe, of how one capable of such concrete, rational and constructionist thought can suddenly expound this ephemeral construct for fantasy. Is she playing with us? I can only hope!"
3,Just Average,"I like Ann's wit usually but in this book she just tries too hard. It is better than her previous book because it was just a collection of articles. I read the book Brainless also right before this one and enjoyed how both were using the same hyperbole. I enjoyed her section on teachers and how they are always whining for more money while we let our policemen, child protective services workers and firemen lag behind in pay. I didn't enjoy her going on and on and on about evolution and creative design. One chapter would have been enough. I didn't need it drilled into me. It was overkill. I would suggest you read this book if you haven't seen her on TV lately or if you want to hear her views. Otherwise get it from the bargain bin or wait until it comes out in paperback. Luckily I got it from zooba."
1,Amazingly Bad,"This has to be the worst misread of American politics and history ever published. I wonder what happened to the author earlier in her life to make her so vicious? Note that the same pose is used on the covers of both her books: using sex to try to make a sale, Ann? This book would make an excellent, although expensive, doorstop. The person it was borrowed from got it back."
1,A Waste Of Paper,"Ann Coulter must need the publicity--that is the only reason I can think of for her to write such a hateful piece of nonsense. Is this a joke? Don't waste your money on this. Whether you are democrat, republican or whatever-no decent person could ever agree with or support this woman's ignorant rants. If it were only possible to give zero stars."
1,Sad,"Just more of the same rabid, hysterical, paranoid, hateful lies. It must be impossible to live as Coulter, always looking over her shoulder to see which new headline she can attribute to a liberal agenda so she can get a little more press. The adoration of people just like her must be a rather mixed blessing."
1,Hilarious,"I can't believe anyone takes this book seriously. I doubt the author does. And it's certainly not worth getting angry over. There's plenty of opinion; it would be nice to see at least some of it backed-up with facts. Yes, everyone's entitled to an opinion. But calling people names does not constitute a reasoned argument. That's why it lost me. [...]"
5,Truth for the truthless,Ann Coulter has done it again. She has exposed the twisted mindset of the liberals who want to rule our lives through government intervention and control.
1,"Dittohead scholarship, conservative religion shown up as jingoism","A rating of 1 is too much, but that was the lowest available. The author makes no pretense at scholarship or responsible writing. This is a book for the already closed minds of conservative dittoheads. If you like Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson, you will like this book. It exposes the religion of conservatism as mean-spirited, knee-jerking jingoism. I see nothing pious, humble, or charitable in the views of such people. This author is not a religious person; she is merely a book-writing entrepreneur who knows what to write that sells to the conservative unwashed. She has made a lot of money and you can expect her to write more of the same, having done so well with this one."
2,A waste of money!!,"A timely book for an election year. It would help create more divisions among the masses and would divert their short attention span from the actual issues. The content of the book is dishonest and silly. You are better off watching reality television for free.The book can be offensive for many people, because it tends to desecrate the memory of the 9/11 victims and their families, but makes Coulter a star. Coulter's new brand of belligerent and loud conservatism is popular because it is entertaining, and would also help the masses act out their anger about their miserable lives vicariously through these so-called neo-conservative characters."
1,New Title for all her books RANTS OF A HYPOCRITE,"I Think somebody should read an Atheist book and soon... And for somebody who is critical about the women of 9/11 and their husbands, sure is making her own share of profits from the women of 9/11 and their husbands!! Can we say hypocrite!!!"
1,Hypocrite,"Where was Ann Coulter when all of her Republican friends were saying that we should not speak out against the President during a time of war? She doesn't think that it is fair that she can't speak out against the widows, others don't think it is fair that they are labeled as unpatriotic if they speak out against Bush. Ms. Coulter also does not believe that the 911 widows should use their tragedy to grant themselves a voice in politics. How did she earn her right?"
4,"A great tool, only one tiny detail","I feel the scoop is just a tad too big. I had another mellon baller, just as good as the KitchenAid, but the balls were smaller and just so cute. Still, it's a great tool and can help in so many ways, not just cantaloupe, but cheeses, cucumbers, and other fruits!"
3,The All-New Clean Joke Book,The joke book was really corny stuff but the books contents were not the problem as much as the condition in which it arrived. The company said it was in very good condition. This was not true. Every page was written on--words and sentences crossed out and other things written there. I would have liked to have known that before I bought the book. I would not have purchased it in that condition.
3,"Less impressed, OK","This was the first De/Vision album I bought, and I was sadly let down. There are better updated synth-pop albums out there (Alphaville's Salvation, Iris's Disconnect, or Echoing Green's Supernova for that matter). I'll give them another try, since so many people rave about this band, but I hope someone could suggest what might be a good album to buy by De/Vision. For completists only"
2,Stick to Trantor,"Stick to Trantor. Or Arakis. Or Hyperion. Or Helliconia. Or Jack Vance's dying Earth. Or whatyoucallit. Because the planet Darkover and its inhabitants are nothing really exceptional, regardless of the audacity of the book cover calling it ""the Foundation of the 70s"".What you will find in Sword of Aldones:Telepathy, the chronic SF plague, moving the plot forward.About two dozen of irritating local nobles, living and dying by the plague mentioned above.A local station of the Earth galactic empire which looks like a comical galactic gendarmerie under the command of a space Louis de Funès.What you will not find in Sword of Aldones:A big story. Someone or something to root for. Answers to dilemmas. Speculation on humankind's future. And so on.Sword of Aldones is described as a juvenile story even by its author. You can safely skip it and stick to Trantor et al."
4,Artful music,"It was only after purchasing this Album that i realized that You Lied is the original version that tool covered on their Salival CD/DVD, The vocals are much clearer than the Tool version and it seems to give the song a new meaning to me. Still i rarely listened to this album untill one day i popped it in and really listened to it instead of just wishing that it could be another Tool album, when i stopped comparing the two, they became two seperate entities and this album's true beauty shown through very clearly. I also especially enjoy the last 2 cuts as well, the vocal style on them is very unique. i would recomend this CD to anyone who appreciates music as art...."
4,You don't need Maynard to be good,"Don't misunderstand the title I think that Maynard is awsome. Although prtty much only on the Tool cds. This cd manages to beat out the very disapointing albums realeased by A Perfect Circle. But don't get me wrong this cd is still very far from the greatness of Tool. To me the highlights of the album are ""catfood"" and ""naked"". If there is a strong meaning behind any of the songs however I havn't found it yet. This is just fun stuff to listen to."
3,"Get the job done, but not my favorite","These levers are blunt and bulky, and when dealing with a tough tire/rim situation, I can have a lot of trouble hooking this tire lever under the tire bead. OTOH, maybe this also means less chance of damaging the tube, or of breaking the lever itself."
1,Spoons are too wide,"I liked the look of these measuring spoons, but I've hardly used them. The spoons are so wide, even the smallest measure cannot fit into any of my spice jars. Definitely impractible."
3,Very bright but not very durable,We have a dark street and seeing the address on the house at night was just about impossible. The green Solar Address Light solved that problem. It really stands out. My only complaint is that the plastic frame that holds the numbers into place is really thin. It has warped and lets the numbers slip out of place. I am sure the warping has something to do with the several 100+ degree days we had this summer. I am anticipating having to super glue the frame so that it will stay flat and not let the numbers move around.
3,Ollie & Harry,"Dispite the title on the package Zenobia is not a Laurel & Hardy film. It stars Oliver Hardy and the baby faced Harry Langdon, butby this time Harry was getting a little long in the tooth to be called baby faced.For more than a decade Hal Roach had kept Laurel & Hardy under contract seperately. And when Stan finally left the Roach studiosHal Roach used Ollie in one final film before Hardy`s contract also expired. This is that film.It`s a cute and funny film, but it`s not in the same class as most L&H; or Langdon films. While the humor in the film is goodit`s not of the slapstick type that both Hardy and Langdon were so good at.Hardy is a southern doctor who is called upon to treat a performing elephant. And much to everyone`s surprise and dismay thegrateful elephant refuses to leave his side after that."
1,3D isn't always better,"This game is supposed to be the ""improved"" version of Pharaoah, which was a terriffic game IMHO, but was a flat, two dimensional plane game. I hate how they're taking these games (like Roller Coaster Tycoon) and making them three dimensional when the three dimensionality only makes it more difficult to maneuver across the terrain.For this game, I couldn't play it that long because the game designers went for realism over function in creating the buildings with the result that every building looks the same, so you forget what is what, not to mention that everything looks bland overall."
2,Christian based story with strong message,"I was a little concerned about this story line because I felt it may result in bad dreams for my young boys. The little boy gets lost in the woods because he disobeys. The ""father"" figure goes out to find him in the end. In my opinion, not a calm bedtime story."
2,I wish it sucked...,This product never should have made it to market. I understand that it is not designed for heavy jobs but it has very low suction and dirt and debris it does pull - falls out the front end when you pick it up off the ground.
3,average stick vac,"Extra battery pack is the best thing about this product. One charge only last 30-40 mins continuous use. Suction power is so so. Brush roll used on carpet/rug gets hair tangled so a pain to clean it. Not great as a hand vac since brush roll part doesn't come off so can't get to crevices easily. For the price, it was better than a more expensive Brisell I tried...and returned to Lowe's. Mainly good for light dusting & everyday lint/hair removal off non carpet/rug floors, keeping the brush roll off so wouldn't get hair wrapped/stuck on the roll."
4,Terrific Product for Small Vacuum Jobs,This is a great product for small jobs. If you have a lot to vacuum the dust cup fills up fast and you will need to empty it rather quickly.The Eureka Quick Up is remarkably light and does an amazing job on carpeting.
5,does the job.........,"This vacuum is excellent for my purposes! I have 2 cats and 4 grandchildren and my kitchen tile floor gets pretty messy with crumbs cat hair, etc. This vacuum is handy, lightweight and the suction is adequate for the quick pickups I need. I don't expect it to perform like a regular vacuum because it is not designed that way. As the name states, it is a Quick and efficient for the price. I did buy an extra battery to insure I had enough power when I needed it. It's performance meets my expectations."
3,Extremely lightweight,"Love the cordless feature especially for larger rooms. Good for quick dust, pet hair clean up. Back up battery is very handy. Not good for small bits of debris such as very, very small hard items. Also, unit tends to fall over even when in fully upright position."
1,What Happened?!?!?,"I tried really hard to give this album a chance. I own Pushmonkey's self-titled album and have seen them play live, so I didn't even second guess myself when purchasing this album. I have a hard time believing that this is even the same group. It seems that they tried to shift their direction a bit (a lot!), and in the process, managed to drop all of the elements that made the first album so great. ""Woman Named Dope"" is really the only catchy song on the entire album (in heavy contrast to the first CD). I'm definitely going to listen to their next effort before I consider buying it. Being from their hometown doesn't mean that I have to like this CD. Do yourself two favors - 1.Buy their self-titled album and 2.Steer clear of this one."
1,Pushmonkey? Pushgarbage!,"Easily the biggest dissapointment of the year musically. Who would have guessed as their first release is one of my all-time favorites. Gone is the addictive guitar hooks, the incredible vocal harmonizing, the in-your-face onslaught of the unique Pushmonkey sound. What happened here? The songs on this CD wouldnt get any band signed and its a complete embarassment. If I could I wouldnt even give this one star - its that bad. Dont be fooled by the 5 star reviews (all from Texas coincidentally! - borrow before you buy youll be glad you did. Again it really pains me to say this as I had really enjoyed the last CDbut this one is awful."
5,Fantastic Piece of Equipment,I was in the remote jungles of northern Australia for 3 weeks and this wonderful device never failed me. Virtually limitless (80 gigs.....try filling that in 3 weeks) storage and a very cheap price....without it I wouldn't have come back with any photos.
5,"Works as advertised...and great price, too","This little device (very light and small, so fits quite easily in any camera bag) is very helpful. For the price of a couple of 8GB compact flash cards, you can hold the equivalent of 10 8GB cards.I haven't used in the ""field"" yet, but in the tests I've conducted with it (on a Mac and a PC), the FlashPac uploads and downloads quickly and efficiently.I recommend this product to anyone who needs extra storage on the go."
2,Disappointed,"The rain gauge as pictured is not exactly what i recieved. The one delivered was slightly different. It was a tapered tube, and the numbers were not painted. The taper is OK, but with the numbers being not painted, it is very difficult to read the rain volume. I am very disappointed."
2,A disappointing end to the Harpers series,"I found this book to be uneven and ultimately unsatisfying -- not up to Cunnigham's usual standards. I liked the two leads, Bronwyn, an Indiana Jones type of character, and Ebenezer, the typical grumpy dwarf with the heart of gold. The young knight Algorind, dealing with real life situations while trying to keep true to his convictions, was also well done. The whole magical artifact plotline was very cliched though. ...There was a clumsy attempt to set up for a sequel that seems unlikely to be written. The ending has a rift erupt in the Harpers organization that doesn't make much sense. ..."
3,Nothing splendid about it,"This book is confusing when it concludes that the reign of Louis XIV was a ""splendid century"" when its pages are almost nothing but misery and backwardness. Indeed, if this book is to be taken as fact, I am infinitely glad that I was not alive in 1600's France. Everything from the sanitation to the mannerisms to the taxation of the time period seem awful even by the author's own time, so I don't see the fascination. Still, the book was informative and touched on things you probably won't find in a narrative history of the era."
4,Cerebrelly Sarcastic,"It's ballsy to rip icons like Springsteen for recycling themes, but even a fan of the boss knows Reynolds is right. I too, wonder why every female in Bruce's songs is named Mary. Only thing keeping this from five stars is the fact you have to think a little too much to follow all the complex humor. Almost every sentance is a sarcastic one-liner. Usually funny, yes, but I found myself sometimes needing a break between his pokes--a moment to relish it and ease into the next one.The cover and the title don't do the narrative justice. I would never had picked this book cold. The cover makes it look like a teen suicide-wish book.I would've given it one more star, except I'm not smart nuf to git all the jokes. Is there a dummy's version?"
3,Does the job,The elbow protectors do a good job but they are sized very small. I ordered adult medium and probably should have gotten and XL. I was able to cut the ribbing in order to wear them as I did not have time to send them back for a replacement. If you need an elbow protector you should order at least one size larger than you think you would wear.
4,Enjoyable!,England 1800'sTHE LOVE AFFAIR OF AN ENGLISH LORD is a very enjoyable read! You'll love the characters and the storyline!
3,3 1/2 stars,"This was, IMO, not the best of the Boscastle series. I liked the characters, and the plot was okay. But it was...well, boring. It was written in such a way that made me skip pages and pages - and I never skip pages of Jillian Hunter books."
3,What about those of us who DON'T have kids???,"This book could be more useful if the author would stop yacking about kids, moms and kids, more kids, etc. There are many working women who DON'T have kids who have just as much responsibility to their work/career, partners, home, family, etc. Also, it seems that her mini-focus businesses are primarily located in the Hamptons or New York. What about the rest of the country? Maybe Faith is enthralled with ""The Hamptons"", but there is life beyond that small region of the universe and she should have been more geographically diverse in her writing.How about furniture for childless women with pets, Faith? I mean, my cats and dog eat dinner with me.It's as if everyone of her friends/cohorts is a mega-successful woman business owner in nicely tailored suits with cell phones. There are some of us (who are considered to be successful) who wear jeans and are not part of the ""corporate"" look/agenda. Next time, perhaps she'll expand her selections."
1,Annoying to read,"I can't even get past the first few pages, and I've tried many times. The ""EVEolution"" jargon, or maybe it is just Popcorn's style is so annoying. Not only does she trash the English language, most of the language is so trendy that it just turns me off. This one is heading for the trash."
5,A must for all business entrepreneurs!,"Faith Popcorn has really hit a mark! I have my own business and the lessons I have learned in EVEolution,common sense and practical advise combined with thought provoking insight to marketing and business , will take any business beyond where they are and take them to where they need to be. Consumers will enjoy understanding why they prefer one brand to another and how they are being marketed to. EVEolution will be a known reference guide for years to come!"
5,One of the best nu-metal bands,"This album absolutely and incredibly ROCKS!!!! The best part about this cd is it has 16 songs, 67 minutes of music, and you never get bored one time throughout the entire CD. The best songs on this album are ""A Violent Reaction"", ""Song for the Suspect"", and ""All Wrapped Up"". Buy this if you like bands like Slipknot, Nothingface, Mudvayne, Slayer, Pantera or you just want a nu-metal band that is good."
5,a great record,"yes this record is a great 1 I am not a huge fan of the extreme heavy genre like slipnot mudvanye but ahc brings the rukus.I am an old school hip hop fan and was turned to this band by some friends (if u read this u know excatly who all 7 of u are). u feel all the emotion in the vocals,as well as the music..It also dosnt hurt when rick im the god of music production rubin produces your debut albulm. I highly suggest that anyone pick up this record it is a experience for all of your senses and youll be pleased as you will see they will be here for a while and are not trying to be hardcore but are hardcore ......"
3,Well... Hmmmmm,"American Head Charge is, to me, a dimly shining gem in the hopeless muddy morass of derivative mosh-by-numbers 'nu-metal'. It's not 100% fair to call this nu-metal, honestly. On the surface AHC unintentionally comes across as a coagulation of Korn(singing), Mariyln Manson(screaming) and any other run of the mill nu-metal band of late attempting angry/depressed socio-political commentary (Epidemic, Dope etc.) Musically, AHC is intense, sure, but comparing this release to Slayer is laughable. Dude, listen to Slayer, dude this is so totally NOT Slayer... As I witness Slipknot/Stone Sour cough up goofy heart-tugging pop songs and progressively cheesier musical diarreha it's a refreshing bath of music to my ears finding at least one true-to-form heavier and cheesier-than-thou imitator-in-hiding. At least they are a Slipknot clone rather than yet another Mudyane clone. With all that said, Yeah a great live band! I own this album so I don't hate it that much! LOL"
1,If Korn and the Backstreet Boys mated...,"these are the kids they would have. I saw them open for SLAYER(a real band, for those nu-metal geeks that have never heard of them).I admit, the CD sounds OK. But after seeing them live, I just can't see them as anything but a joke.They had seven band members! Who the hell has Seven band members?The guitar is just a bunch of basic, recycled, two finger power chords. There is no reason for them to have two guitar players. And whats with the dual keyboards? These guys hardly played anything. All they did was dance around the stage like N'STINK.Anyway, I'm the first to post a negative review about these posers. I have probably offended some of you. Oh well."
2,Disappointing,"THis cd is probably the worst i ever bought. The singing is terrible and you can't even understand the rythms of the songs and the annoying tone of it. If anybody has a brain, get something else a hell of a lot better than American HEad charge. Like COrporate avenger or some other good metal."
4,Band worth looking into,"This band is actually my boyfriend's brother's band (the lead singer being his brother) so I may be a bit biased. At any rate...I'm not really one for the hard, hard rock. However, I really did enjoy ""Just So You Know"", which is just the perfect blend of the rock that some crave and the mellow sound that I enjoy. The other mellower songs (though ""Just So You Know"" is the mellowest, by far) are also a bit more my cup of tea.Personally, I'd check this band out & promote them; given the chance, they'd be huge."
1,what ever happened to DS's writing,"I just finished reading the first 60 pages and its so annoying. She must repeat at least 10 times that she has been seeing Phil for 4 years. I feel like there are lots of fillers here, she repeats everything we know so many times she could have written 60 pages in 20. I do agree that she was once a fantastic writer, but not anymore. I doubt I'll ever read another of her books, don't know if I'll even finish this one. So far its a really boring read."
5,Great book,"If you love Kay Scarpetto, you will love this book. As usual, written beautifully and keeps you wanting more reads about her adventures on the job."
4,Usual Cornwell,I like the feasibility of her stories. The technical details are good; at least plausible. Characters are believable. Recommended for crime solving show watchers.
4,ForensicMystery,Another mystery solved by Patricia Cornwell's star forensic pathologist. Dr. Kay Scarpetta. By her knowledge and experience Dr. Scarpetta has solved many mysterious deaths for several years.
3,Pretty but too fragile,This is a beautiful shawl/stole and it has a lovely feel. But it is almost too fragile to wear. The least touch causes it to snag.
1,boo!,i made the mistake of thinking that any kitchenaid product must be good. i used this baster on my Thanksgiving turkey and it just didn't work well at all.
2,If only the drivers would blinkin work with DirectX 7,"This card should work theirs a large window in the software where the video (should) go, but the darn capture goes into an annoying tiny blue window which won't close off my screen and as soon as i plug anything it it keeps capturing and capturing even though the utitlity isn't running. The capture and everything doesn't work. If only the darn thing came with or there was a place i could find drivers that worked with DirectX 7. (I know what the problem is due tsomeone else's review)"
2,Don't throw your money away...,"There are one through eight levels of challenge setting for the this elliptical, however when you change the levels of difficulties there is absolutely no difference in the levels what so ever. You are just sweating a lot, but the measurements of your speed, heart rate, distance traveled, and level of challenge are neither accurately measured, nor feel like a difference is made. I would say if you like a very low challenging elliptical that would help you feel like you are doing something rather than nothing, then it is a good purchase, otherwise you are better off saving your money and investing into something that might be a little more expensive than this one, but actually work. It is not worth your money, especially with this economy."
1,all girl summer UN-fun band,the cd is just not nearly as good as the songs on the 7-inches. derivative. boring. and i'm not even snobbish about my girl-pop! but this was just too uninteresting for even me...
1,Defective product,"""I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, after 2 weeks, the round thing on top of the watch came off.The seller says it has to be sent to repair..and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back. I am so embarassed of the poor quality gift I chose and can't belive they will not replace it ..with an apology...their answer is just not acceptable.""But there is nothing else I can do but write this review, I have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews I read I was happy with the gift..but now ...I am so disapointed"
3,"Sizing is off, so can't tell how the product helps yet","I measured my arm above and below the elbow (10.5"" and 10.25""), and ordered a small based on their description of fitting up to 14"" circumfrence. This size is too small! I can get it on, and it feels good for a short while, but clearly it's a stretch. And after awhile (30 minutes or so) it starts to be uncomfortable. After an hour, my forearm is very tender to the touch, possibly because of loss of circulation. I have to remove it to get relief.So I can't tell how much this will help me. I've ordered the medium and will find out after it arrives."
4,TRIPLE BEAM-36 Zips,"This is one of the most solid albums I have heard in a while...I'd get it a solid 9/10...The best traks are...36 Zips,Old School Fashion,Across The Border,Addicted 2 The Game,...Go swoop it up and get A-1 Entertainment's first release..."
4,STUNNED,"I'm biased. I'll admit. A bit of research will show that I edit the 'zine this novel was first serialized in, however when I finally got around to purchasing it, opening it ... reading the thing from cover to cover; rather than the quick summary I initially did - - I handed it to my eighteen year son and said, ""If you don't read this, you'll regret it later.""I'll tell you what my son said today, ""I want a sequel. That's what I regret. That there isn't a sequel.""The reader will find themselves caring about the characters who are the ""guys you see every day"". You'll hate yourself for giving a damn.And you will. Before You Were A Prophet is funny, irreverent and entertaining. Just when you think you're reading something light, it becomes heavy with a perfect amount of truth that will stun you. However, as the author says, ""None of this happened.""Or did it?"
4,Collective improvisation,"I first heard this album in about 1970, when it first came out. I was so impressed I saw the band twice in one week at the Village Gate. Even though they did the same set list, the songs were very different with each performance.A listener gets the same feeling when playing the album--the musicians were improvising a lot of the riffs; there's a freedom to the playing that's different from most jazz-rock bands of the early 1970s.Michael Brecker on saxophone is nothing short of amazing on ""Asset Stop."" Billy Cobham on drums changed my concepts of what a drummer could do in jazz-rock.The sound on the original LP is a little unclear as the band gets louder (a lot of it was recorded live in the studio), but the overall sound is still great.Liner notes and credits on this CD re-issue are non-existant."
4,Nice reliable flash drive,"12Meg/sec rd, 1.2ms access timeno cap - open plug end is not good for dusty workplacestoo thick to plug directly into stacked portsnot easy to tighten lanyard bolt enough for it to stay put"
5,The Best of The Jazz Trumpets,Love the original Jazz trumpets! My grandson is in a school music program and needed to learn the Jazz rhythm from the best. He loved this and is playing with a couple of groups now (he's 13) Amazon is always the best place to find what you need!
1,I'm With Lucy,"Boring movie, I got it because David Boreanz was in the cast; however, his part was insignificant so he could save the movie."
3,Superb vocal talent spent on mediocre songs.,"About 30 minutes of top quality rock-a-pella. Ten songs. Some good, some forgetable. Voices are fabulous - which is typical of the Nylons during this period. The arrangements are very creative but . . . this album doesn't leave me singing the tunes in my head. I walk away thinking, ""Wow that was really well done"" . . . . and then tend to forget about it. There are some good songs but overall this album seems out of focus.I was spoiled by ""Happy Together"" which I think was their best album. If you are looking for more of the same on this album unfortunately what you get is a shadow of the incredible vocal work capable of this group.Recommended for Nylons fans (like me) but if you have never bought a Nylons CD buy ""Happy Together"" and get blown away. You'll wonder why this group never became all that popular. For a second Nylons CD get ""One Size Fits All"". Those are my recomendations."
4,"Devestatingly awesome, but loud","Simply the most powerful fan you can get. Don't spend eighty bucks on that overpriced Vornado when you can get a good all-steel fan like this. We're having work done in our basement and the contractors love it I'm afraid they're going to take it home with them!It's impossible to point this fan to blow horizontally because the fan housing strikes the floor. I think it's intended to be angled a little bit up or down or maybe that's why it's on sale.The housing is all-metal so it has a three-prong, grounded plug. That's what I need in a wet environment. I'm not a fan of the so-called ""double-insulated,"" plastic housings that do not have grounded plugs."
2,weak,"weak is the word for this one, very little air movement and at $58 a steep price for what you get."
2,Only for total beginners,"The only audience for this DVD is for those who have no familiarity with stringed instruments at all. It is very slow and methodical and never really goes very far. As a guitar player, I spent 10 minutes on this and benched it.I was going to give this a higher rating on the basis that its audience is supposed to be beginners, but it keeps referring to the book which is a separate purchase. It does not even come with any tab. I have not seen the book, but that may be a better buy as the previous reviewer mentioned."
1,Eureka F&G Premium Filtration Vacuum Bags,"Very disappointed with the bags received. There was no packaging, just 6 single bags (2 orders) in a box with no writing on the bags. They look like a prior order of 10 bags for half the price. Do not believe I received the ""premium filtration"" bags which were much higher priced."
1,what happened to RBF?,"I hadn't bought an RBF album in a few years and decided to order this since I absolutely loved ""Why Do They Rock So Hard,"" ""Keep Your Receipt,"" and ""Turn the Radio Off."" I don't know what happened but every song on this album is garbage. They basically repeat the song title over and over for lyrics and the musicianship is positively uninspiring. I listened once all the way through and will NEVER listen again. Terrible album, they really phoned this one in."
4,Wonderful refreshing story,"I am so happy to have read this great book. I started it and could not put it down. It was such a simple but elegant love story. This book was very fun,interesting,and relevant. It is a must for somebody that just wants to feel good and happy when they get done reading a book."
3,Meh,"I popped this game in just to see what happens. The story line is decent nothing out of the ordinary. The graphics for then it was created are pretty good and the scenery is pretty fun. However, it just wasn't what i was hoping for. As long as you moved slowly (and even sometimes just run right at the AI) you wouldn't die. I played on normal and for the sake of ""personal pride"" just wanted to finish the game so i didn't feel like I wasted the money buying it. I would say if you have a friend that has it borrow it. Its a decent mindless game that is fun for a bit but you won't play it more than once. However, i will agree that if you liked Max Payne you will enjoy this game as well."
4,Almost Perfect,"This product is worth the money don't get me wrong. I love the different scenes I can play on my 55"" TV and surround sound. The only one that seems a little cheesy is the aquarium. I got the sense it was filmed at a fish store in the corner. Also the fish had to have consumed large amounts of energy drinks as they dart across the screen at sprint speed. That or they were watching a DVD of sharks swimming in front of them. Either way - its hard to relax with the fish practicing for the olympics...what really saves this DVD is the fire scenes. If this is what you really were looking for when this DVD popped up - get it. Perfect scenes, fire crackling, and the campfire scene also has crickets chirping in the background. Well made, high quality HD, and for the money well worth it. The fifth star didn't get colored in because of the lava lamp (zzzzz) and the poor fish on caffine..."
2,Dissappointing,"From the reviews I expected a great deal more than this. I was hoping for soothing, but everything seemed to be on fast-forward. The flames were rapid, the sad fish aquarium could have stood to have a few more fish, and the lava lamp was a single style. I got the other one with a lot more stuff on it that I haven't watched yet. Hope that one's better."
5,Love!!,"I had this running throughout a Christmas party, and even sitting at home during the holidays. It creates an unbelievable ambiance, and agree with others that it somehow makes a room, and yourself!, feel warmer. Can't wait to do the lava lamp for another party, and the fish is just cute. Highly recommend!"
5,very relaxing,"The quality was top-notch. The audio was what I hoped for. (crackling sound with the fire place etc.) To get the FULL effect get some ""burning leave"" candle's, or incense.Could not believe the great price for a great quality item. I would have paid twice as much and been happy. Thank You"
5,Really Cool!,"This is a great item. Great conversation piece. It plays continously so you don't have to keep pressing ""play"" when it ends."
3,"Yes, it's okay.","You have your choice of scenes, but they repeat too quickly. They are, of course, realistic though. Better than a blank screen."
1,The Jury,The book arrived in excellent condition. I read it and truly enjoyed it. It was hard to put down. Very exciting to read.
5,"imperfect, dirty, beauty","when i first heard bjm's new record i was a bit dissapointed at the quality of the production. it didn't seem to have the same rock edge ""give it back"" or ""strung out in heaven have."" upon further listening i discovered that below the layers of super muddy guitars, noise, and vocals lied one of the darkest, saddest, most sincere rock records i'd heard in a long time. it's a lovely thing to have something knock my socks off very quietly."
5,Track List,"Track List: 1. What Is This Thing Called Love, 2. A Sleeping Bee, 3. Ill Wind, 4. Caravan, 5. My Funny Valentine, 6. There's a Small Hotel, 7. Softly As In A Morning Sunrise, 8. They Can't Take That Away From Me, 9. Love Walked In, 10. Russian Lullabye."
1,Blocks don't match,"I received the 2 blocks, which I assumed would be identical, since they were a 'set of 2.' I was very unhappy to realize that after I opened them, threw out the box, etc., that they were not the same purple block. They are slightly different sizes, which is a big deal in yoga. Correct alignment is essential in yoga and now I have two different blocks. Do not order these blocks."
5,fit the bill,"I bought this for a woman actually serving in the military in Afghanistan and she, so far, said it was perfect for the task and loves it. We'll see how it holds up."
5,great light weight watch,"I owned another victorinox watch that I purchased about 7-8 years ago. It just stopped working recently and the jeweler said it would be cheaper to buy a new watch than to repair it. I was disappointed because I thought these watches should last forever. Nevertheless when looking for a replacement I could not find anything that suited me better than this watch - I have a very small wrist and the look, feel and fit of this watch is perfect. I bought the watch from Nordstrom's for $130. The strap makes the watch feel like it is worth less. At $80-90 this watch is more appropriately priced. For all those who are unsure, go try on the watch at the department store but save some money and buy it from Amazon."
1,Order Imitacion de Cristo y Biblia Catolica,"I was unable to download this books yet to my blackberry tablet, due to technical difficulties, I love this books but I cant downloadthem yet to my blackberry tablet. Actually I will like to cancel this purchase together with the biblia catolica in spanish, becauseI'm not able to download my kindle books. Let me know if you can cancel this order and when I m going to be reimburse.Thank you for your attention to this matter."
5,Fuerte pero lo necesitamos,"Excelente libro, lo recomiendo a todo cristiano que quiera parecerce a nuestro Señor.A mi me dio unas cuantas bofetadas en la cara porque sin persarlo me estaban describiendo en muchas ocaciones."
4,Buena edición,Una excelente versión de un libro maravilloso.El índice ayuda mucho y la traducción es muy correcta.Recomiendo a todos los que quieran llevar vida de oración.
2,Not our favorite,"Although we own several Jan Brett books, this one was disappointing to both me and my 7 year old son. We read it several days ago as I was scheduled to be the parent reader in his class the next day. Needless to say, we chose another book for me to read to the kids. Although the illustrations are beautiful, the story is odd and a little creepy... Trolls invading a home on Christmas Eve and eating the holiday meal?? I understand the book is based on a Norwegian folk tale, and while I can appreciate that, we just did not enjoy this book."
1,cranky little product,"I don't actualy own this product my sister does, but I did use it once. The horibble review she would give it would take a page or two, so I will give you my experience. We had a little saw dust on her carpet from sawing 1 piece of moulding. The 4 month old product with an empty cup only managed to move the saw dust around alot. Mind you, it did do a superb job of pushing the saw dust into the carpet."
3,Decent Performance and Function,"The Quick-Broom provides decent performance and value for the price. Decent power but fairly noisy as well. The tube for nozzle attachment is too short to be practical. A flatter, wider sweeping head would be an improvement. Since I don't need those super-powerful and heavy benemoths, this product does what I need it to do adequately."
5,Now That's a Pizza Wheel!,"After whizzing over the same spot over and over trying to cut pizza with other pizza wheels, I finally resorted to just cutting the pizza with my chef's knife. Then I found this! It is just as sharp as my knife and goes through pizza or focaccia like it's cutting butter. It's heavy and sturdy so you won't have to worry about pressing to hard on it. This is truly a good buy with the blade protector being an added bonus."
5,Wonderful album,This is an album composed of classical music that just about everyone is familiar with and it's done beautifully. I love it upstairs in the living room and also put it into my computer so I can play it while I work as well.
4,Gift,I gave this tower to a friend of mine and he has not had any problems with it. He says he's happy with the tower and would purchase another one when needed.
2,I don't like it.,"For the price this stuff should work great. And, for those doubters, I have a great buffing machine, a DeWalt. I also have the proper foam for each tyoe. I have used other products that work just as well or better for a fraction of the price. I got this product and the Ultrafine polish as well. Used one after the other, and I'm disappointed."
3,Share the experiences of college runners looking for victory,"I found this to be a very light hearted look into the lives of a few serious runners. As I runner I found myself smiling inwardly often, as they described the joys and the pains of their running."
2,Don't bother unless you're a glutton for punishment,"This book is not only poorly written, but annoying as well. Weak plot, poor character development, and a portrayal of runners as self-obsessed egomaniacs results in a book of marginal quality. ""Runners World"" is more inspiring, uplifting, interesting, and better written than this book. The author should stick to running or writing non-fiction."
2,Borning Story..,"Being a runner, I had heard much about this novel. ""The"" novel about running. So when I saw it on the shelf, I bought it. The novel was disappointing. The writing was not very good. The dialogue between the characters was terrible. No wonder he was not published until now. Its not worth publishing."
5,Great book for the serious runner,"John L. Parker does a fantastic job of capturing the mindset of a serious runner. Anyone who has blacked out in the home stretch, or performed the self mutilation of a twenty mile run will be able to relate to Quentin Cassidy, the book's protagonist.Only one aspect of the book was obviously unrealistic. While running injuries plagued some of the supporting cast, Cassidy himself never got so much as a shin splint. However, this triviality in no way takes away from the dead on descriptions of the world of balls-out distance running.Great book for anyone more than mildly interested in the sport."
5,Great book for runners,I really enjoyed this book and found it inspirational. I doubt it would be as interesting or compelling for non-runners.
3,one point before buying this as a gift for someone,"I considered buying this book for my niece (who just started running highschool crosscountry), so I read it first... and decided not to buy it for her since the book is remarkably sexist. I enjoyed the book a lot and ignored those parts, but...anyway, if you're looking for a gift for a friend or family member who's a runner, read the book before buying it for them so you can be sure it's appropriate."
5,delicious and different,"A great idea for a topping for baked fish, making salad dressing by adding extra olive oil and lemon juice, dips, etc. I like having a jar of it on hand and it's organic and healthy too. The seller got it to me very quickly; no problems."
5,Flawless,Angelika's voice is perfection; a true inspiration! Beautiful! Bach would be so proud and honored to hear his music sung by her.
2,I always received defective flags,The quanlity of this flag isn't very good. I always find different defects of flags. It's a pity. We need good flag!
4,great with multiple computers as long as you have your personal network administrator (my 23 yr old son)!,"Have had this product for over a year, it works well, occasionally needs a hard reboot and about once a week, my son has to come and do something on my computer. But, I have the gremlin effect on every computer or accessory I touch! We currently have 7 wireless computers on network (4 desktop, 3 laptops) and two wired connections."
1,Buy D-Link instead,This was a bad experience for me. Wasted many hours actually thinking this piece of junk would work. I need a stable connection for work. Decided to cut my loses and buy D-Link. Problem solved. Placed the router and the Netgear PC USB adapter that also did not work in the trash because I would not wish this on anyone.Will more than likely never consider another Netgear product due to the poor quality.
4,The crowbar of bottle openers,"Purchase this cause I've been on a KitchenAid kick lately. After I got it, I thought, ""Man, this is freaking huge."" Plus, I looked around and realized that most bottled things I deal with are twist-offs. It's solid. It's massive. I wish I had non-twisty bottles to work it's magic... :^)"
3,"Compares to US movie ""American Pie""","If you like teen targeted films with a lot of sexual humor, this film is probably perfect for you. It's funny... but not laugh my pants off funny. Its storyline isn't too bad. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7. It's not a must see. But if you're into asian films and sexual humor you would be wrong to pass this movie up."
5,Super Giant Chihuahua,"An extremely high quality toy, just exactly what my daughter wanted as a ""mama"" to her webkinz and beanie baby size chihuahuas. And a great price compared to the retail establishments in my area!"
3,A Not So Good Anime....,"It's cheap....but you really get what you pay for. It's rather amusing, and the action scenes are done fairly well, but there's a lot of holes. There's too much humor that's incredibly stupid and better suited for the younger audience. If you're over 13, I wouldn't reccomend buying this anime new....get it used and for cheap. You're MUCH better off saving your money and getting Rounin Kenshin."
3,MP3 download is poor quality,"Lost my copy of the CD so downloaded the MP3 album for Christmassiness, and I am very disappointed with the quality. It sounds like a scratchy old record even at high volume. Other downloads have played well for me so it's not my speakers."
2,Not what was expected from Kitchenaid...,I purchased this one (in red) and was immediately disappointed. The ringer is set at a very low volume and can't be adjusted. The metal ring (looked stylish at first) fell off and I can't replace it (maybe I'll try gluing it back). For what was expected this item is very lackluster.
5,Great buy,Seller was great and got item to my grandson on time for him to start getting his brain washed with this stuff that kids love for some reason but I find annoying. Probably cause I am an old crabby bastard from a third world country.
3,Veggie Tales? Who knew?,"OK, I hate the idea of the Veggie Tales. I didn't buy any CDs, DVDs, read along books, or anything during our kids toddler years.The silly songs are great, though. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit to it, but ""I love My Lips"" and ""Cebu"" and ""My Cheeseburger"" are funny, and they stick with you.With this particular product, there's a disc that is set like a jukebox, and the interface is really a pain in the rear to work, but overall, great fun without any of the didactic tone that I think exists in some of the other presentations they have.It's only music."
4,"Good camera, red eye a problem","I like the camera a lot but the red eye thing is really hard to get away from since the flash is so close to the lens axis. The camera is small, easy to use and with a 512 KB card can really take a lot of photos. The video feature is useless, but so what, that's why I have a video camera. I like the battery charger's small size and the ability to use commonly available batteries while the rechargeable ones are in the charger. All in all an easy to use and carry camera that does a decent job of taking pictures and with careful placement of people and using the red eye elimination feature can do good close up work. Oh by the way my wife reminded me that one of the more important reasons that we got this camera is the larger view screen."
1,777: First Flight,"Sorry folks I just was not feelin this one. I guess I had the wrong expectations. I was hoping to see some facts on the aircraft i.e. max cruising speed, max altitude, max range, who's using flying. No none of that here so if u were like me wanting to know these things then u better pass up this video and look else where."
2,Disappointed,"I have bought this brand before, but this was a disappointment. The soap did not really bubble up and you better rinse off thoroughly in the shower afterwards because you itch bad. Won't buy this one again."
2,Needs more help with implementation,"First of all, the enclosed video with this product is really more of a promo; it helps very little with using the course.Secondly, the written material is put together like a menu. The ""appetizers"" are some fun and easily implementable activities to help kids gain an overview of geographic concepts.The ""desserts"" are different ways to output the learned material.However the ""main course"" in which I expected to learn HOW to teach my kids to ""map the world by heart"" was nothing but a list of the continents and all the countries and landforms that need to be memorized. I was looking to this course to teach me HOW to teach my kids to ""map the world by heart"" but all it showed me was the WHAT. It, unfortunately, was a waste of money."
1,Don't Buy This !,"This product deserves zero stars !I purchased this product last year and used during aerobic classes . Throughout the classes the Cd player continually jumped and skipped , which caused dissruptions throughout the class - I found myself continually apologising to the participants, which was both dissruptive and embarassing . It was only when I read a review on this website I realised that other people where too having the same problems, I thought the cd player needed cleaning and even considered taking it to get repaired. I would appreciate it anyone could offer a suitable alternative ? I too bought the product from pure energy and I will be contacting them for a refund. Thanks for having an informative website - I've found it really useful."
4,Compassion is key.,This book hits the purpose of healthcare on the head. Anyone who has ever had anything to do with healthcare can relate to this book. Compassion is key.
5,Great item,It has a side power supply and came and handy I connected my xm radio to it and we had music can't beat that
3,Very silly!,The humor of this one escapes the understanding of a 5 year old. Would not recommend for a 5-6 year old.
2,Amish movie about the men,"I found this DVD to be interesting & somewhat entertaining. The movie almost solely revolves around the amish men, their roles in the family, society & community. This contains nearly nothing about the amish women & girls. Being a woman, I was hoping for more about the female life within the amish home. Very dissappointed! Felt this was a waste of money for me."
3,Oops,"The documentary is interesting enough.It's not saturated with fact, which can be good or bad depending on your expectations.However, I did laugh when, during the explanation of Amish migration westward, the state of Missouri was named while the state Illinois was highlighted. Rest assured, both have strong Amish communities. But I did wonder how this goof got through editing. I expected better from PBS."
5,Best Ever,"This is my favorite of all their albums. For me, it just went downhill from here. ""Angels' Flight"" is such a beautiful and magical song, it would have been well nigh impossible for mere mortals to match. Talent will only take you so far, to reach the highest levels requires inspiration of a special kind. They had it here."
2,Then end of Shadowfax,I picked up this cd because I am a huge Shadowfax fan. This is the most disappointing of their collection. Guitarist G.E. Stinson is hardly heard on this recording. I can understand why he left the group. There are just too many synthesizers and keys on this cd. I found it quite boring.
3,One Man's Story!,"This tape is a nice reprint of two PBS airings on Backpacking. It is an entertaining account of one man's hiking experience in this beautiful country. My only complaint is that it falls short on information. I was expecting a guide to hiking in Belize, which would include 'what to bring', 'equipment you should have', etc. There is little content on the flora & fauna...except Killer Bees & Ticks and some casual shots of a few birds and snakes. Overall it was enjoyable, but not informative."
3,The bunny died enroute,"The order and shipment of my mouse went quite as expected. I found the installation simple enough, though somewhat disappointed that the serial adaptor does not ""fasten"" to the pc. It depends on the connection to hold without any form or ""fasteners"" other than the pins themselves.The darn thing wouldn't work, however. I rechecked my installation, rebooted (twice)..nothing. Finally, i ran to the drugstore, buying two AAA batteries, and replaced the ones that came with the shipment! Voila! It worked!Once in, it does all it claims to do. I enjoy it, though after 1 day am not sure the benefit is worth trashing a good mouse ( mine was dead of old age)."
2,Too tight and too abrasive,"The heelbo seemed to be the answer to my need for elbow pads, but the large size was FAR too tight and the material was irritating. I tried to stretch them out, as they are supposed to fit up to a 19 inch limb. I could hardly get them over a 16 inch can and they are still not comfortable. I bought the elbow protector cradle lite X large and it's the answer ! It is a bit long, but it's soft like a sock and doesn't irritate my skin. It's large enough and white as my workplace requires. I'll probably use the heelbos to clean my car and toss them."
2,Where's the music?,"Very little melody,harmony, or rhythm.Not in the same class as L.Juber,D.Smith,or even E.Gerhardt.Boring."
5,One of my favorite shows.,"Anyone who has seen an episode already knows this is a gripping show about travelers and ordinary people that either suckered into or forced into a very bad situation. The reviews I find the most helpful list the episodes so here they are:Disc 1:ChechnyaUgandaKoreaDisc 2:BangladeshPhilippinesKuwaitDisc 3:IndiaPakistanLima, PeruDisc 4:MalaysiaTaiwanEcuadorIt's unfortunate that not all of the episodes are in this collection. I hope they add them to a different collection soon."
2,Repetative ... could have fit on one DVD,"Many are not ""locked up"" stories, but a monotonous series of tourists being kidnapped and drug through a forest. 3 stories were identical and I thought I had either mistakenly replayed a disk, or their was an error in its manufacturing. I cannot recommend buying this product."
2,Rusty Screw,"The cutter works awesome, but the screw that holds the blade is rusting after just a few months.It says it is dishwasher safe and I still use it, but I CANNOT recommend a product that rusts.I've contacted Kitchen-Aid support, but have not heard back yet. If they correct this I will re-evaluate."
2,mixed feelings,"I love KitchenAid but several of their products I've purchased have rusted on certain parts of the product. Like this pizza cutter...its a great cutter, cuts every pizza and even other items with ease. However the screw that holds the blade to the handle is all rusted. Its only like 3 months old, I've followed washing directions exactly. Kinda gross. But it still cuts. Wish they could fix that problem though. Otherwise a good product."
2,Tell us more Palmer,"If you have no clue what the movie industry is like, or know nothing about screenwriting, then i suggest you buy this book. As far as screenwriters that want to expand their knowledge, I suggest you look somewhere else. Don't get me wrong if you have writen a screenplay and need to know what to do now, Linda Palmer may really help you out. However Linda came accross to me as very self centered. She constintly talk about herself and what she has accomplished. I'm very happy for her but i don't think she should flawnt it in front of our faces every other line. Especially for those people trying to make it in the movie industry. Also it seems like most of the time all she can do is recommend movies to watch and study. Which is a very important thing to do though, i don't think it is what most people are expecting in this book."
5,The Best $80 I have ever spent!,"I purchased this machine 8 years ago just before my 1st child was born. I had also just purchased all white furniture. I am proud to say that 8 yrs and 2 children later my furniture is still white because of this machine. Not to mention the numerous koolaid, ink, jelly, etc.. spots it has removed from my carpet. I love it and am about to purchase my second one, but now theyre only $50! If you have children, pets, or are just plain messy you have to have one of these."
1,Waste of $$$,"It's does not vac at all. I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica, they worked great. Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well. My only good vac was the upright that's cordless. It does not clean very well, but does the everyday job of picking up dirt. My ex-wife got it and still using it. I need to get one. Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too. Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy. 3 strikes, your out Hoover. I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
4,Easy to use and Really works!,"After we built our house and filled it with white carpeting, I realized how much I was going to spend keeping it clean. With a 3 year old and a small dog, this machine has kept my sanity. It works best when you use it as soon as you can after a spill or puppy ""accident"". Also, it works better when the water you add is REALLY hot. It even got out some stains the movers left that the professional company could not get out. I love how easy the machine cleans up afterwards too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I think the cord is too short. If you have an extension cord this wouldn't even be an issue. One review said it was really loud, it's no louder than a regular vacuum and I think to get the suction you need to lift out a stain you have to expect a little noise. GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,born to sing,this is not a 1942 movie born to sing with leo gorcey the other guy is wrong... this is a new singing lesson dvd...
5,The Original,I have enjoyed these since the 70's as a child at swim meets! The Protien Rich Bars are the best flavor!
5,Busy Mom,"My 2 teenage boys ( & of coarse all his friends) can't get enough! They have to be the ""KING"" size; other ones are too small."
3,"Tobin, please be careful...","Perhaps because I know he can do better, perhaps because I am convinced of his utter genius, and because Permutation and Bricolage were pure gems, Supermodified was disappointing -- more often than not. I hope you won't lose fans to gain more vapid others."
4,Some comparisons,"I haven't even finished the album yet, but I dig it. It's got a dark ambient feel, almost industrial like a Meat Beat Manifesto, but it's fairly playful and flowy like the Orb. Also, after only four songs its seems pretty consistent in quality. First time I've heard bought this artist by the way."
1,Don't be the biggest fool,"Cock Robin's debut album was raw and edgy. ""After Here Through Midland"" was smooth and polished. ""First Love, Last Rites"" was powerful and bitter. ""I Don't Want to Save the World"" is dull, listless and boring. Kingsbery's conscience must be troubled, for these songs are off in the wrong direction. With the exception of the title track and Bo, he subjects us to a string of love songs endlessly disecting his fifty-plus year old love life. No good bass lines and really bad poetry. None of the new tracks would have made the cut in the past.If you want a good, late career album, try Dan Fogelberg's Full Circle or Level 42's Retroglide. They are still true to the music."
5,One of the best renditions of a comic opera,"I went and saw this live at the Met in 2008, and it was absolutely outstanding and fun. Juan Diego Florez has been one of my favorite singers since I saw him in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, and he doesn't disappoint in this. The DVD is great, and really captures the feeling in the theater. If you like opera, this is a must-see, in the theater or on DVD. The singing, acting and staging is all top-notch."
5,Another comedic masterpiece,"I remember seeing a traditional La Fille a long time ago; I was bored stiff. But on the strength of the many 5 star reviews, I took a risk on this La Fille.Do it! Like the Le Elisir d'amore with Netrebko and VillazonDonizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Eschwe, Netrebko, Villazon, Wiener Staatsoper, it takes middling music and makes it tremendous fun. Don't let the anachronistic setting (WW I?) scare you off; this is one of those cases where it works.Dessay starts out as a near-manic, but her acting quickly turns the prosaic story into a dramatic hoot.And then there's Florez' high C's: enough said.I haven't seen the competing La Fille with Ciofi and Florez, but this one is simply too much fun. Get it."
3,Sizes are too small,"This ""X-Large"" Heelbo padded sock was too tight on ankles with a 9.5 inch circumference. The manufacturer's sizes seem to be about 2 sizes too small for an adult.Item had to be returned.You've been warned."
5,heel protector,"have used these as elbow protectors for over 3 years, found they work better than others I have tried. Offer great protection if you have to be transported in an ambulance, or in a w/c"
4,"You pay for ""almost "" perfect.","Logitech makes great products and by in large, this one is no exception. Assuming you have the right placement of the transmitter to eliminate interference from your monitor etc... it is a fast and easy set up. The keyboard is light, but you have to hit the keys a bit harder than I would like and its noisy. The mouse works well, and both do have that ""cordless"" advantage.I was unable to kick back and type. I kept getting inaccurate keystrokes that appeared to be hardware error, not the operator. As long as I kept the keyboard on my desk... all was well, but since I got it to be able to move away from the desk, I can't say I'm thrilled with what I would consider to be a fairly big chunk of change going to this item.Best wishes to all those who want to give it a try, I'm going back to the plug in myself."
5,Good Product,"Works with NT and 98 with supplied software. The directions are scarce, but not really needed.The transfer speeds with Kingston CF cards are excellent.Overall a good product"
1,"Negative 10,000 stars","Trying to sit through a ""movie"" like SOUL PLANE is like trying to swallow a mouthfull of rusty nails-it might kill ya. SOUL PLANE has no plot, performances that would create the worst acting ever category in the oscars, And proves that the only uncle tom is Tom ArnoldAvoid this piece of trash like the plague!!!And Monique sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,"""Nothing Better to do"" type of funny","I wouldn't spend a ton of money to watch it, or make a big production of its viewing, but it is funny. Snoop is very cool and there were a few parts that made me laugh pretty hard. I would actually consider flying with that airline, even though I would belong to the Honky family."
2,Wrong Movie Sent,"Instead of receiving Soul Plane we were sent Soul Men even though the order form and receipt clearly stated Soul Plane! We kept it anyway, too much of a hassle to return it."
2,Web-based reprint.,"De Inventione is an early work by Cicero that he repudiated later in life, but it was influential for many centuries. Apparently the Loeb Library edition is out of print, so I tried this one. The Kessinger edition is just a reprint of a text available on the web. It is an 1888 translation by Charles Duke Yonge, but you have to search the web to find that out because this edition doesn't have any bibliographic information other than ""translated by C.D. Yonge."" There are two tables of contents for some reason, one with page numbers and one without. The first paragraph of each section is left justified, while all other paragraphs are fully justified. All in all, a fairly sloppy production job, perhaps done mostly by a machine. If you just want to read De Inventione, this edition is ok, but you could also just print out the web text. However, the paper and binding are ok for the price."
5,Holds the dog hair!,"I bought these bags as replacement bags and so far so good. They hold in my two dogs hair with no problem, helping to keep the carpet nice and clean."
5,So helpful,"My fiancee and I, following the advice of our pastor, started reading this book a few days before our wedding and continued during the honeymoon. All I can say is that it is extremely helpful. From physical, technical advice, to discussing how to make sex an integral part of your intimate relationship, it really gave us a great start in exploring this post-marital world.Everything Rosenau says lines up with the Word, and we found ourselves resonating with all of his instruction. Very insightful book written by a wise man!"
4,THIS ONE IS A REAL SUPRISE!,"Wow! I htought I had seen it all when it came to zombies. Something about it made me want to buy it (ok it was the price.)But to my amazement this one is really good. Holds nothing back! The spfx are top notch and the subject matter is timely. Great acting (really) and a good direction move this opus along at a good clip. If youre a gore hound you wont be disappointed. This is soaked, caked, baked and deep fried in blood. A great tribute to Evil Dead, Day of the Dead, 28 Days Lster, and Night of the Living Dead, with a dash of Return of the Living Dead thrown in. Its a great mix, and it has some genuine scares. A treat for any Halloween!"
1,terrible,"I have an idea, since our zombies just have green paint on their faces let's shake the camera alot when they attack then you can't see the halloween makeup. Let's have alot of dull scenes with silence or just driving from one place to another... i loved how the lab guy knicks his finger working with the sap and he turns within like under 1 minute, but the dude who got a chunk out of his leg took an hour or so to change; and even another guy who got bit changed in about a minute. The picture quality was poor - no matter if they were indoors or out. The female lead was ok, but sorta hard to believe she can lose a boyfriend and a few hours later have sex with the dude's son who she is protesting against. I think most of the tension i did feel was due to the frustration of attempting to watch ANY of the zombie attacks in shakey camera mode."
4,A must have for Digital Camera users.,"I bought one of these ImageMates right after I picked up my Nikon CoolPix 950. It was an easy installation, and has made transfer of my pictures from my camera to my computer a breeze. The newer camera's support USB. But my 950 only has a serial interface. Which thanks to my USB ImageMate I've never had to use. The compact flash card shows up as a external drive on my desktop, so I can just drag and drop the pictures right from my card to my drive. Nothing could be simpler! And when I have a full 128 Meg Card it is appreciated! The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that inserting the compact flash card can sometimes take a minute because it's not as easy to insert the card into the reader as it should be. Minor quibble over all, so if you don't have one get one! For the price you can't go wrong."
1,lackluster effort,I will put as much energy in this review as Mr. Feist put in writing this novel.Mechanical and poorly written. Don't waste your time or money on this novel.
3,"OK, but not exciting","I discovered that I was reading Feist's Midkemia books out of sequence and was already familiar with Squire James and his nickname of Jimmy the Hand. This book tells of how the young thief came to be connected with Prince Arutha, but it ends still in Jimmy's boyhood. I hope somewhere in one of the series we find out how Jimmy gets back with Arutha and becomes Squire James, the prince's agent. Maybe my disappointment is my own fault for reading the series out of sequence."
5,When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...,"Get this pizza cutter. I got it and love it. I am so glad Kitchenaid is making kitchen tools and gadgets to go with my Kitchenaid appliances. This is a heavy-duty, high quality cutter. It is 10 times better than my Oxo one that I am retiring. Kitchenaid makes not so good cooks like me feel like a gourmet chef."
5,Outstanding Historical Adventure in Norway,"Mystery of the Silver Coins, second book in the Viking Quest Series, is a wonderful book! It's an action-filled historical fiction. Bree O'Toole makes her escape with another slave from a Viking ship and the plot is exciting. This story pulls the reader into every scene and it has realistic characters. Kids nine and up will get not only a fast-paced story, but they will see perseverance and faith in action. Inspiring book--the kind that is worth reading again.The author obviously has done a lot of research, and it is evident that she was in places like Bergen, Norway by reading her descriptions in the book."
3,All the Little Live Things,Chose because I think the author is an excellent writer. Did not think it was up to his other novels.
5,A haunting climax,"Stegner is a master at building a story to a resounding crescendo that will stick in your memory for years. The climactic scene in All the Little Live Things is haunting, delivering in a few pages a graphic and disturbing image of the pain and suffering of life and death. Not that the novel is entirely dark. The most hopeful character in the novel is dying, but living her life to its fullest until the last. The climax in Angle of Repose comes close to the level Stegner reaches here, but although brilliant, it falls short of the climax in All the Little Live Things. This novel is absolutely brilliant."
3,Not my favorite....,"I found this book to be somewhat dated, written in the voice of a grouchy old man reacting to the moral changes and excesses of the 1960s/1970s. I read this immediately after reading Stegner's ""Angle of Repose"". I really enjoyed ""Angle"", the characters were relatable and the story was gripping. In contrast, I found ""All the Little Live Things"" to be a disappointment."
2,Shrinking Spectrum,"I've had the vacuum cleaner several years now. Since then, the vacuum bags, which are the ""S"" series of the Futura/Spectrum, have shrunk in size. The bags are about half the size than originally."
1,A well-meaning ineffective book for me,"If you are looking to read a woman's story about losing her brother from a short-term illness, and of her guilt about leaving his hospital bedside prior to his death to go back to her out-of-state home... then this book is for you. Unfortunately, it did not help me at all. I lost my brother to a long-term illness and had no guilt, as I was one of his care-takers and was by his side when he passed away. After I purchased and read this book, I resorted to searching online and found free information more suited to my situation and dealing with what's called ""Anticipatory Grief"". Wish I had researched more before buying this book. Very disappointed."
5,Very Genuine and Passionate,"Another Five Stars for the author Lee Hayes. I just hope and pray he puts Darryl and Kevin back together again. How I have been searching high and low, up and down, for a relationship just like Darryl and kevin."
4,Learned what a soliton is,"Good techno-thriller. Some of the tech is far out, as is the man-made crisis the story hinges on. The story has the requisite two-dimensional characters, but is ultimately a lot of fun. The authors are quite prolific, unfortunately it looks like most of their recent output has been Star Trek novels. Ick."
3,BE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE PARTS,"I received this lens and looked forward to using with my Kodak Dx-7590 digital camera. However, upon receipt I discovered that a lens adapter is needed to transition from my camera's 49mm connection to the 55mm connection on the wide angle lens.After weeks of searching for an adapter at the Kodak store, Amazon, e-Bay, etc. I have given up and must return the lens.CAUTION-BE SURE YOU ARE AWARE OF THE NEED FOR AN ADAPTER ."
3,"hard to take off, sheer","i love the look of the polish, i just didnt like that it's very difficult to take off but mostly, you need to put on at least 3 coats to really see it."
5,Gorgeous,"This color is impossibly gorgeous. It's a deep berry pink with subtle shimmery glitter. Love it! And since it's OPI, it's a superior product."
3,Gets the job done,"This nail polish is okay - it gets the job done. My bottle just went sticky after a few weeks, so you need to use it up the first week. And only paint one coat over so it cracks evenly. It's definitely tricky."
5,Nice!,"Just bought this and applied 3 coats to toenails and one coat to nails on hand. Love it! If you like a medium pink sparkly polish, this is for you. Haven't tried to remove it yet, so can't comment on that. Cheaper price if you look elsewhere (e website)."
5,Love it!!,I absolutely love this nail polish. It looks so good on top of my coral red nail polish. Definitely a good purchase.
1,OPI White Shatter,"I was very disappointed with the OPI White Shatter nail polish. The polish did not ""shatter"" as the other polishes I have purchased from the OPI line did. It just created a one line streak for some reason. I'm not pleased at all."
4,So Pretty,I absolutely love the Teenage Dream. The only thing is because it's a shimmery nail polish you have to use more than one coat. I used a very light pink nail polish as the base first and then used the teenage dream. It looked fabulous and you could barely tell that I had put a base coat of a different color. I was getting complements on it all the time that one of my coworkers just had to go and by Teenage Dream herself.
3,IS VERY STRANGE!!!,"Welll it's something really new for your nails.... I;ve never seen it before! Somebody will love it, and somebody will hate it. What can I said?! It's different. That's all."
5,This stuff is so cool,"I had no doubt that an OPI product would deliver on what it's supposed to do, and sure enough you put a single coat down and it shatters. I recommend experimenting with it a bit just to make sure you're getting the right consistency, and I'll definitely be playing around a bit more to create different effects with it."
3,Black Shatter,"I am a little disappointed with this polish. I thought it would be a shatter look, but it's more like zebra stripes. Also, it doesn't last long at all. I put it on at night and by mid-afternoon the next day it looked terrible."
1,For Black Shatter,"I purchased this item on in the middle of April. A month later, I noticed that the polish was getting very thick. I read other reviewers stating the same thing, but hey it still worked. It just made for bigger crackles on my nails. Well yesterday I opened my bottle to use it only to discover that it is now a solid black glob inside the bottle. I only used this stuff a few times, so how could it possibly become a solid block? I have never had a nail polish do this before! And OPI is held in such high regards as to quality. I am now leery about buying anymore OPI products. I have other crackle products, mostly by China Glaze, and they have never even begun to get thick. Maybe I had a bad batch."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT - BUY AT OWN RISK,"I gambled and bought this product (in spite of the negative reviews) just to save a few bucks. Looks like I picked the wrong product to gamble on. Just put one of the ""new"" color cartridges in my HP Deskjet 810C, but it only prints in magenta; both yellow and blue are MIA! Now I have to spend the extra money I saved and replaced this with a new cartridge. Some people have had no problems with this item, based upon the feedback, but it does now appear to be a crap-shoot. So, you have to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well, do you punk......?"
4,Melody's Treasures returns,"I received a twin pack of HP ink, which was unopened. For some reason, neither of the ink tanks worked. I changed printers (same model) and they still didn't work. I contacted this seller and they sent out two single tank replacements that did work relatively quickly! I sent the ink tanks back to the return address but the seller even stated I didn't have to do that!This was a good transaction due to the customer service of this seller!"
2,Didn't do it for me,"While I'm a great fan of Lescroart's team of Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky, I've enjoyed some of his previous standalone novels featuring Amy Wu, Will Farrell, and Glitsky (without Hardy). I even like the Gina Roake character.Usually Lescroart's books will keep me awake, turning the pages until 2 a.m., but this one...not so much. Like ""The Hunt Club,"" I put this one down without finishing it. I really dislike Wyatt Hunt and the whole ""Hunt Club"" storyline. Hunt just doesn't have the likeability or depth that Lescroart gave to Hardy and Glitsky. Blearg."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have read just about all of John Lescroart's books and I have to say this is the worst. The plot was too thin and way too predictable for a well known author. The suspect (the husband) did all the typical dumb things which made him look guilty and the attorney chosen to represent him had never handled a murder case before. I was totally bored and after 100 pages I just skipped to the last two chapters, so I felt like I didn't totally waste my money on this book. I hope he is not losing his touch as I use to really enjoy his books."
5,Best on the market,"I finaly got to the point where i decided to break down and buy a graphing calculator. All my friends have TI 89s so i decided that was what i would buy. When i went to buy one the place was sold out, But the sleek styling of the HP 49G caught my eye. It had all the features i needed so i went ahead and bought it.It is the best out there. Although it is somewhat difficult to figure out at first, You can quickly get the hang of it if you just mess around with it. Once you understand all the functions it puts the TI 89, or any other calculator, to shame. Buy it!!!"
1,A disappointing HP product,"I've been using HP calculators for over 14 years. I bought the 11C, 15C, 41CV, 28C, 28S, 48SX, and 48G+ (my latest). But this one was such a disappointment that I had to return it. The keys are horrible, they have a slippery feel and are hard to press--unlike the quality tactile feel of HP calculators past. The manual is an insult; it was slapped together at the last moment, it seemed. In my opinion, there's no way you could learn how to use this calculator effectively from such an anemic manual if this were your first introduction to an HP. This is not the HP calculator that I know. Although it retains much of the processing engine of the 48 series, the interface is klunky and the fonts are ugly. The worst part is not the things I just mentioned, but the fact that HP have gone backward instead of forward in producing a useful, quality calculator. Don't let this flawed product give you the wrong impression of HP calculators. They usually are top notch."
5,This will forever remind me of my childhood winters.,I cannot think of a collection of music that brings more fond memories than A Winter's Solstice. So very peaceful. Amazing in tandem with a warm fire and a warm cup of coffee or hot chocolate. Every time I hear it I think back to Christmas time as a kid. After a long day at work or a tough time this is always the first thing I reach for. The later CD's have a few good songs here and there but this one is consistent and has no let downs on it whatsoever.
5,Best of Winter Solstice series,"Out of the first five of this series, this is my favorite. It may be the shortest, but it flows together like magic. This contains one of the best compositions by Mark Isham and David Qualey. The album was my introduction to Windham Hill and has remained a favorite."
1,Finding Jesus,".Jehovah's Witnesses don't need this book to ""find"" Jesus, as one reviewer stated. We already know VERY WELL who Jesus is. -- Jesus said: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" -- We believe this quite literally. Jesus is THE ONLY APPROACH TO HIS FATHER. -- To me, those who say that Jesus is God are denying who Jesus really was.....GODS OBEDIENT SON. When they deny that, they deny the true significance of his sacrifice! -- Very sad.."
3,just eh.,Rhodes research is unobjective and biased. At times I thought he was grabbing at straws to prove his point.. even to the point where some scriptures were being taken out of context. I used this book just for some fun with some JWs and they too gave a convincing arguement using nonJW publshed ancient greek intralinear translations and multiple nonJW Bible versions that directly contradicted Rhodes theories. I gave his book three stars for grammer.
5,This has always been my favorite Jim Chappell CD,"I have all of Jim Chappell's CDs and they're all wonderful--but this has always been my favorite. You literally feel your body relaxing and sinking deeper into the chair when you start to play it. And it's really cool how, after a particularly productive day at work, listening to ""A Job Well Done"" makes you feel even prouder about what you did :-)."
4,OK MInts,Review for mints... they taste pretty good & there's a lot in the container. Only problem is they can break/crumble which leaves a fine powder leaking out of the case. Can be kinda messy.
3,Who'd have thought it!,"Well, you would never have guessed it without reading this book, but the ""wildchild"" of Formula One, Jacques Villeneuve, is actually pretty tame. He fusses about his eyes being sprayed with champagne on the podium, he is obsessive about changing his fireproofs up to three times a day while testing, small stones finding their way into his car bother him, he doesn't like loud noise and stuffs tissues in his ears to protect them at discos... Its all here! Worth a read if you're a dedicated JV fan!"
5,"A little mystery, some history & well woven story.","Found this treasure while visiting Vancouver Island, BC - the setting for the story. An unexpected tour guide, as well as a great read."
2,Can't get past the odor,"I purchased this to use on my face for pre cancerous lesions ( per a guest on Dr Oz). I applied it to my face, but could not stand the smell so I rinsed it off. It did leave my skin much softer and might have been okay for another area of the body."
3,Great until it broke,I loved this garlic press - have used it for approx 3 years. It did break as another reviewer mentioned where the chrome met the plastic. I purchased another garlic press model from kitchenaid and it doesn't work as well as this one.
1,Hollow Plastic - Beware,"Garlic presses gotta be strong and though this garlic press looks robust, it is very fragile. The metal 'tang' that seems to run through the handle is actually hollow plastic. I know this because mine cracked in half after only a few uses. This garlic press is useless. Stay away."
4,Simply Awesome,10 times better than expected. Still would prefer it to work on all colors. It only works on light colors.
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this as I live in Ottawa but had not been able to attend the concert. I'm glad I didn't. The music is insipid to say the least - a far cry from their earlier improvisational days (but still better than the bubblegum techno-pop TD was to move to). Many of the tracks seem to feature a single muscial phrase played over and over. Yawn! It's not helped by the poor sound quality - OK, this is a fan recording so we shouldn't expect a pristine soundboard, but it is muddy, distant, and lacking in tonal range. At least crowd noise is not too invasive.Die-hard fans will probably want this but it's not for the casual listener. There are far better CDs to help you fall asleep."
3,Short and to the point.,"""Johnny Depp"" is good for a young admirer interested in this actor, since it leaves out some of his ""rougher and wilder"" days, but that can also mislead a fan of his into thinking that while he didn't have a wonderful childhood or adulthood, he was nearly always righteous. I noticed that used ""Johnny Depp: A Modern Rebel"" by Brian J. Robb took some of what Esme Hawes wrote verbatim, but Robb's biography was more in detail, not leaving out many facts (or truths), and was up-to-date (Hawes book is from 1997, leaving out much of Depp's more recent films and his newly acquired blockbuster status). The pictures are limited, but are in color, and the book is written straightforwardly making it easy read. If you're looking for an introduction into the life of Johnny Depp, and you're a younger fan, than this will please you, if you don't mind it being out-of-date. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"We installed this fan in my daughter's bedroom, adding a light fixture. The installation was a little tricky...they aren't exactly clear on how to twist the screws when the rubber gasket is laying over top of them! We had to make cuts in the rubber. Looks awful if you're paying attention, but not something most people pick up. The fan itself is just ok. Not what I thought it would be in terms of the air movement. A little disappointed to be honest."
3,Hunter Sontera,"Overall, the fan is quiet and does the job, but takes significantly more effort to install than the several Hampton Bay fans I've installed in the past. Also, the trim ring that fits around the top of the canopy does not quite match the rest of the fan in color."
2,Doesn't hold up in a dishwasher,The scoop works just fine but after about 6 months of normal use (1-2 times a week) the finish on the concave portion of the scoop began to pit/peel. After about 1.5 years it's severely pitted and I don't consider it safe to use (who wants ice cream scoop pieces in you're ice cream).
1,Don't Bother with This One,"I purchased this CD in the hopes I would discover some well-produced Christmas stories. What I got instead are five stories with a very unimaginative narrative. All five stories are read by the same person who makes several stuttering mistakes throughout the CD.The audio is muddy as if the microphone was covered with a sock and the musical interludes are boring and sound as if they were recorded using a tin can. There are no liner notes whatsoever and no production credits.""Christmas Stories"" is nothing more than a cheap production of old, venerable stories that could have been produced much better. The entire program sounds as if it were transferred directly from a cassette tape to CD. I strongly recommend AGAINST purchasing this item."
3,missing washers hinder performance,"The hose came with the washer between the spray nozzle and the hose missing causing it to leak. Also when attaching the hose to a sink faucet, an additional washer will be needed depending on how it connects to your faucet. There is a washer and adaptor to fit an outdoor style water spigot. Finding the correct size washers can be difficult. After all the additional software is available it works reasonably well."
4,Good Product,"This hose has done a great job for me... it makes it much easier to water my plants. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is because I had to go to the plumbing supply store and get an extra attachment ($4) to make it attach securely to my sink. Also, some people complain that the nozzle part leaks, which only happens on mine if it is not tightened. If I tighten it, it stops. Overall, I'm very happy with this!"
2,Can't get it to connect,"A great idea for a product but I can't get it to connect.Have made 3 trips to the hardware store and can't find aconnector that will work. It won't connect to the kitchensink, a bathroom sink or a shower. I think they should bemore specific about what type and size of things it willconnect to. I have wasted a lot of time and money on this hose."
1,Hose attachment smaller size than standard sink faucet,I cannot fully review this product as I have yet to be able to attach it to my sink. The hose attachment threads are smaller than my sink faucet threads. I have a standard sink and now have to find an adapter. This is pretty frustrating.
3,It does work,Originally I was against it - could not find a coupling that worked - then - aha - take apart the coupling it has and then it did fit. Mind you - it won't fit any new beautiful faucet. However - if you have a utility faucet - maybe. Take apart your coupling on the sink and the one on the hose - and maybe! I still hold - not as great as it should - but it does do the job - just not universally.
1,where is it,i have yet to see the bag all i got was a cd and i did not order a cd so i was a victim of false advertisement.
5,Undergarment Purchase,This item was exactly as described. Very reasonably priced and very fast shipping. Would definitely purchase from this merchant again.
2,"Good Movie, Mediocre DVD.","The movie was good with solid acting and interesting plot. But the DVD left a lot to be desired. The picture quality was passable. There was no other special features except trailer. The worst of all, the English subtitles couldn't be removed or turned off. For a price of US$29, it could be much better!"
1,"Kitchen aid CAN opener -no, it's a Junk can NOT opener !!!!!!","We got one opener and was barely able to open any can so we bought another one. The brand new did exactly the same thing. All cans that we tried to open took multiple attempts with many sharp edges and never really opened right. Our cousin got one and her does the same thing. Basically it is nice looking worthless piece of junk. Now we have two brand new openers that can not open any cans.In frustration we bought cheap Chinese opener for 3 dollars at the supermarket and it works like a charm - there is no can that it can not open works every time with a nice clean cut at the edges with one single cut.KitchenAid was big waste of almost $20 for each opener - what a rip off. DON""T BUY it. We have other kitchenaid small appliances like blenders, choppers mixers and they are OK but this one item is just junk.Kitchen Aid should remove this from the market to save them self good reputation earned in the past."
5,Wicked,Nothing to say other than its a darn good can opener. Good amount of leverage so not much muscle needed. Doesn't slip off cans. Worth the cash. Good solid feel to it. Doubles as a nun chuck for home defense purposes.
1,How can one call this a can opener?,This an absolutely terrible product. A screw driver and a hammer would be as effective. It is hard to grip and cuts in random segments. How can Kitchen Aid put there name to this product is beyond me. It is a total waste of money.I just replaced it with the OXO Steel can opener and the contrast is unbelievable. I now have a product that actually does what its name says it does and does it cleanly and with ease.
5,"""Make It"" Yourself - Made Easy!","After I received this product, I found I was able to use the software that came in the package with other ""Make It Yourself"" items I had purchased at the local Walmart. It's a great project to spend time on and share your creation with others at a minimal price."
5,great stories,James Herriot tells the best stories..I have bought all of the CD's I wish there were more
2,Worked for a while...,"I purchased this ice cream scoop after I ruined one of the antifreeze scoops by washing it in the dishwasher. The scoop works well. However, although it was advertised as dishwasher safe, the inside of the scoop has begun to pit. Also, the handle collects water in the dishwasher, which slowly leaks out in the drawer. I'm tossing it."
1,KitchenAid Red Ice Cream Scoop - IS NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,"It looks good and is comfortable to use, so what is the problem? It says it is dishwasher safe, but soapy water fills the handle and then drains into the ice cream. The company kindly replaced it a then said they recommended hand washing. What kind of advertising is that? I wish I could rate them no stars. Now I question the advertsing for all of their other products."
1,Not what I expected,"I got this to read to my 5yr old son but this is not a fully illustrated book for children. There are very few illustrations & not aimed for kids to understand. Was very disappointed, but I guess that's why it was only $1.00"
4,Good choice,"My kids loved reading this book! My kids will read a little at a time, and I like that it was so in expensive."
1,Do not purchase this movie due to illegal activity!,"Do not purchase this film due to illegal activityThis movie contains unlicensed music that was used without permission! The song ""Circles' is by the band Throwback Suburbia and was released on the EP ""Four Play"" in 2007. Director Joey Harlow released the song as ""Out of Control"" on his CD by the same name in 2009. Joey Harlow has committed copyright infringement and THEFT! JOEY HARLOW is a complete fake and fraud and has been stealing music by other artists for his own profit. He is selling our song and the music of others on several websites like amazon.com, I-Tunes, CDbaby, Reverbnation, etc. He has been notified to remove any and all unlicensed music by Throwback Suburbia. Other artists he has stolen from have been notified as well."
5,Price Increase,The product was wonderful. The only problem I have was that within 90 days the product has almost raised $1.00 in price. In November the item was $1.49 and todayiut' $2.36. That is a problem.
4,Great series.,This series is too funny. It brings back memories from the 80's. Candice Bergen stands out with an all star quality cast.
5,FYI back at last!,"It is a real pleasure to have Murphy Brown finally available, the first season is great and I can't wait for the others to come out in DVD."
3,Not Your Typical Death Cab,"What the heck was Ben Gibbard thinking?!?! The cover of the Smith's ""This Charming Man"" is downright embarassing and should of never seen the light of day. The keyboards in the track ""Tomorrow"" borrow heavily from New Order's ""Temptation."" Bernard Sumner and Co. deserve writing credit for this song. The rest of the tracks are pretty mediocre at best...painful as going to the dentist at their worst.If you are new to Death Cab...skip this cd and go get ""The Photo Album"" or ""We have the Facts"" instead. And while you're at it get the Postal Service's ""Give Up"" as well. These albums are better in every possible way than this cd of rare B-sides and demos."
1,Don't waste your money,"I too bought this at home depot for a very simple tub caulking job. The caulk removal tool is a plastic piece of garbage that lasted barely long enough to get the old caulk out of the tub. The caulking tool did ok, but the rubber piece came out within 20 minutes of usage. I recommend you keep looking for a better product as this one was a disappointment and waste of money!"
3,"Remover is great, smoothing tool not so much...","The remover tool worked excellent, with just a little pressure to get through the seal and start removing the old caulking. The flat edge worked excellent to get the caulk that had been smeared onto my window off also.The smoothing tool was a disappointment to say the least. If I pressed hard enough for it to work, it just smeared caulk all over the place, and ended up taking too much off; but if I didn't apply pressure I would have needed more than 2x more caulk for it to even begin smoothing it out, and would have been left with more than a 1/2 inch bead of caulk! I ended up using the back of a plastic spoon, which worked much better."
2,Don't expect to reuse it,The caulk remover seemed to pull up the caulk faster and easier than the pointed metal tool I used last time; however I don't know if that means I did a poor job last time or if the product helped expedite the process. Don't expect to use the tool more than one time as the grout wore down the edges almost immediately. The smoother worked well in some patches but not in others. Buyers need to decide if the price is worth it for their job. Perhaps the smoother performs better for people who caulk frequently.
4,it works!,"Always suspicious of wierd-sounding ancient herbs, I got into this stuff with reservation, but it really has helped my mood and cravings while using this tea to aid in smoking cessation. to be safe, due to the sheer number of herbs in it, and their effects, I'd check with a naturopathic physician or herbalist before using, to be safe, esp. if you're taking RX's, either my 'scrip or OTC"
4,Woman and the Atomic Bomb,"This work chronicles the role that women played in the Manhatten project during World War II in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, physics, health biology, etc. It also provides an interesting account of the role of women in the physics discoveries during the early twentieth century which made the development of nuclear weapons possible.This book is especially valuable since this information has not been treated in any kind of systematic way in any previous historical accounts of the Manhatten project."
1,Dissapointment,I got this can opener as a gift. It doesn't work and is cheaply made. I have resulted to my leatherman to open cans as it takes less effort and leaves a smoother edge.
4,Arrived right in time,"I bought it as a gift and therefore do not know how well it works, but still consider the price to be a little too high - I could buy a decent crock pot for a few dollars more. Hopefully it is the last can opener I ever buy for my parents"
5,A magical excursion into a long lost world,"Willa Cather was a lapsed Protestant who wrote two of the greatest novels of the twentieth century dealing with Roman Catholic characters: this novel and the even greater DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. This book is many things at once: a magnificent historical novel, a wonderful depiction of an adolescent growing up, and a wonderful evocation of a world that none of us can visit any longer. I do not know what possessed this midwesterner to write a novel about 17th century Quebec, but I am delighted that she did. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."
3,An okay show,"It seems like with the Wayans family, the younger you are, the less funny you are. This is where ""The Wayans Brothers"" series started but the show was funnier around the time they both cut their hair. Marlon is mildly funny but Shawn is not and was only there as ""eye candy"". The plots are your standard, sitcom material. I would buy it if you're looking to build your DVD collection."
1,One of those typical 90's sitcoms,"The Wayans Bros. was one of those typical 90's sitcoms. Two wacky guys, working at a diner, getting into all sorts of trouble with their hijinks. Nothing really stood out about it.The Wayans brothers themselves are pretty funny, but the writing for this show was nothing more than typical sitcom drivel. They got into wacky situations that were over by the end of the half hour. Don't get me wrong, I did chuckle quietly a couple of times. No laughing out loud, though.If you're looking for something to watch with the Marlon and Shawn Wayans in it, pick up something like White Chicks. Don't even bother renting this one."
5,Hilarious!,"I just got into this show about 6 months ago, and it is HILARIOUS!! I guess lucky for me it still comes on where I live. For all those looking for Season 2, Wikipedia said that more seasons would more likely not be released because of poor sales for season 1, which really sucks because they are too funny!"
3,country,"this CD is OK but it is more of the same, I have other ones that already have alot of the same songs on this one.I love country music, was raised on it, didn't know there was any other kind til I heard my first Elvis. There is only so many times I want to listen to the same old same old."
5,ceramic brush holder,"i ordered this to hold my brushes while i am painting, but the box gave me even more ideas. for example, if you are painting on white ceramic, you can actually use this to see what your colour will look by painting on the brush holder first. just wipe it clean immediately."
3,Anime Okay,"Jubei-chan is an ok anime.It has its ups and downs,Jubei has barely a personality and the episodes are almost the same.The anime shows hope though.The 300 year old samurai and chief that has all his expressions on his t-shirt make you want to watch more.I'd say get it if you like anime and are new into it."
4,great shoes..not so good fit:(,"I love the look, color and style of thses shoes, not to mention the quality, I will most likely have these for many many years to ocme!! :) The only problem I have is that the strap gets tighter and tighter around my big toe, unitl I can't take it anymore and have to take them off and readjust them. If you have these, you know that is no quick and easy feat...I am hoping that in time I will either get used to it, or it will get better. Othr than that I really, really like them!!Thanks."
5,Best shoes for summer camp,"These are rugged shoes for being outdoors & are great water shoes too. The quality is amazing & I know they will last for a long, long time."
2,Pretty But Didn't Fit,"I ordered this and although it was shipped quickly, I found that the straps were stretched out on the left shoe and it just didn't fit. I have an adverage size foot and it was too wide and too easily stretched."
3,"cheap tassel, gets the job done","Well worth the $2. But not remotely worth the $7 shipping.From a distance, this tassel is excellent, and its small size functions well for faster movements with the straightsword.But if you look at it closely, it's poorly made; hardly any effort has been made to cover up the bulbous base that forms the shape. The strings over this base are so loose it's just hideous."
2,"Nice, but unfinished","As many other reviewers pointed out, this album feels ""unfinished,"" and for good reason. It's mostly demo-quality.However, the re-workings of classic Fields of the Nephilim tracks ""Darkcell"" and ""Trees Come Down"" may justify the purchase for hardcore Fields of the Nephilim fans. They've been given the proper attention. Frankly, though, I'd consider picking up the single (available via Amazon) for those tracks instead.If you're looking for an introduction to Carl McCoy's work, I'd instead recommend the Fields of the Nephilim ""singles collection"" <i>Revelations</i> as a starting point if you're interested in the epic guitar-driven gothic rock sound; or the fabulous <i>Zoon</i> album (under the Nefilim moniker) if you prefer a harder, metal-influenced album."
1,"Not a ""Killer back"" workout","I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas. The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play. But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back. In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form. A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn. A good abs and waist workout as well. There are alot of twisting moves. The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one. Michael only performs half of the exercises himself. He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention. I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout. But its easy to manage without them."
2,Not very a user friendly player,"I recently recieved the Pine SM-320V for a present,and am very dissapointed in the product. I installed the software as directed pluged in the mp3 player as the manual instucted to do, and i cannot download any songs onto the player! The manual says nothing about connecting the player except conect player to computer! A friend mentioned something about a printer port having to be changed or something?? If this is the case, then i am very upset that the manual does not discuss this inportant step to have the ability to put music on the player! More than likley, it is my lack of computer skills that do not allow me to properly connect the player! I think this player would probably be great if i can evre figure out how to connect it with my computer. If anyone knows how to do this properly or what the deal is with the printer ports, please email me with your help or suggestions (neuf_07@yahoo.com)"
5,Movie Review,"Very eye-opening documentary, a must see for America and the political system. We can do better! There is a need for change."
5,Stamina Elite Recumbent Bike,This is one of the best pieces of exercise equipment you can use particularly if you need low impact. The use of the handlebars add to the cardiovascuar workout. The backrest/seat make this very comfortable when using.
3,Excellent season - terrible DVD,"I love Night Court and relished having a DVD collection of the series. However, this 1st season DVD has some issues. Maybe I just have a bad copy...half of the episodes are not edited correctly. The images and the sound do not match. It makes the DVD difficult to watch.Is it just me?"
2,"Best Seasons, after season1","The Best seasons were after season 1, when Markie post, Mack, and Roz appeared. They are probably not releasing the rest of the seasons based on the fact that season1 did not sell.Season1 was not the best."
2,"nice idea, but falls short","We bought this pirate game for our 5-year-old son. We don't play with it as intended. It is a ""hot potato"" type game, with vibration, voices, and finally an explosion at the end...that part is cute. In my opinion though, the plastic is too hard to use as it is supposed to be since play gets faster and faster towards the end of ""hot potato"". Our kids (ages 7, 5, and 3) were playing it and as it was going off, our 5-year-old threw it towards the 3-year-old and hit her in the head. It could also break something in the house as they whip it away from themselves, trying not to get caught with the bomb at the end of the game. We have since used it as a bomb to hide or set at someone's feet and they laugh about it ""going off"" as a ""gottcha"" type game. I would not buy it again."
3,palette,dish is good-the cover does not look like what was pictured. It does not fit snugly for travel as portrayed.Disappointing..
2,eraser size skull,"The product is nice, but notice how there is no mention of the size. The size of this pendant is a little bigger than a pencil eraser. I would say its more the size of a charm than a pendant. Delivery was fast. Price IMHO, is overpriced for what you get."
3,Defence of relativism,"This is really a collection of essays, rather than a single sustained argument. The first essay on ""Notes on Relativism"" is interesting in its characterisation of different versions of the notorious idea. The Feyerabendian theme is present throughout all the essays: that 'there is no single method of discovering truth in science' is extended to other areas more explicitly, esp. cultural phenomena - e.g. ""Progress in Philosophy, Science and the Arts"". Some essays are focused on topics of debate that arise out ofAgainst Method- e.g. ""Putnam on Incommensurability"". As usual, he presents an audacious defense of absurd and unpopular ideas - e.g. that the Greek gods were real, and that Ernst Mach, vis-a-vis Einstein, wasn't so philosophically backward after all. The essay on Popper is typically uncharitable, and even mean, but entertaining for precisely that reason."
1,I Don't Get It,"Whats the shtik with this book? It's just a bunch of pictures of random people doing mostly silly things. One was of an aborigines man putting clay on his face and the photographer tried to make it seem like this ""deep"" concept when it was just some guy putting clay on his face (the commentary made it seem like he was some sort of exotic animal). I did not connect to any of the photos and felt like it was for the most part just a collection of various pagan practices."
1,Beyond horrible and despicable.,"This book is beyond horrendous and totally misrepresented - not to mention ignorant.This is why children and UNEDUCATED adults fear snakes. This book depicts violence that the parents unwittingly offer to their children. There's a food chain - animals eat other animals - deal with it.A python is incapable of swallowing an elephant.It's this type of ignorance that begets more ignorance. The writer should be completely and totally ashamed.By the way, I am a noted owner of pythons. House cats pose more of a threat."
3,I have a problem with my phone modem.,I have a problem with my phone modem. it wont hang up and when I dial the number i have to disconnect my phone line for i can get a dial tone from it. the phone modem is only 1 year old. it is a 3com u.s. Robotics 56k inter. I use a 3 1/2 disk with modem drives 2977. what can i do?
1,A unique and enchanting retelling of an Anglo-Scots ballad,"""Through a Brazen Mirror"" is the first novel by one of the very best modern writers of serious fantasy literature. Based on an ancient Anglo-Scots ballad called The Famous Flower of Serving Men (a magical, tragic tale about a young woman who disguises herself as a man after the murder of her husband), Sherman deftly weaves folkloric motifs into a fascinating exploration of gender identity. If you can find this book it is well worth the search--for it's appearance in the 1980s instantly established Sherman as a major writer in her field."
3,This book is very simple.,"This book is very simple. Just ""Do""s and ""Don't""s. The life is much more complex and using these ""Do""s and ""Don't""s make our life very poor and not exciting."
4,Nice products and well made.,"No complaints. They are decent quality and look very good. Today is the 4th, and they are festooning my home as they should."
2,Disappointed,"Admittedly, I was disappointed when I sifted through the pages to find that many subjects listed in the content pages had been barely discussed in depth. Although this is a book about the business of publishing it fails to cover adequately the subject of editorial schedules and disseminating information. The layout makes it difficult (I found) to take in the information and use it to your benefit. There are very little illustrations or visual examples of layouts to guide the inexperienced publisher. Much of the information is written in a general nature and is basically just common sense. I found myself, after reading a few chapters, asking many questions and the answers, I'm afraid, are not in this book. As someone new to the publishing business I was looking for something that I could use as a reliable guide taking me through the process step by step. Alas, this book did not meet my needs."
5,Absolutely love it!,"This certainly beats any of the silicone jar openers I've tried. It is really easy to use and looks nice also. It has several size ""grabbers"" to choose from depending on the size of the lid. It does take up a fair amount of drawer space, but well worth it."
1,Stupid Idea,"The idea for making toys out of crayons was obviously made by someone who didn't care how their home looks. Race cars will be played with by little boys. To make one out of a substance that crumbles into the carpet, marks the walls and makes a mess that can be walked through and spread throughout the house, marking everything the shoes touch, is not a mom friendly product. This is a dumb idea. An uncle gave it to my boys for Christmas and it was opened and a car made before I even learned about the toy. I would have taken it back if it was unopened, but now it will go either to the trash or to the Salvation Army. I'm not sure if it is right to ""bless"" someone else with a toy with this many drawbacks!"
5,Nice product,I use this as a mold for my lotion bars. It's a good size & they pop out easily. I will buy more.
1,One Star,"A disgusting book.These Chinese prisoners were well cared for and created thcir own problems. American GIs and international civilian POWs in North Korea were freezing, starving, beaten and shot on a daily basis. Read ""In Enemy Hands"" by Larry Zellers to learn the horrors of the death march and the constant abuse suffered by prisoners of the communists during the Korean War."
4,I liked it... after about page 100,"Is is me or did it seem like someone else wrote the first 100 pages of this book? Ms. Hobbs has a style of writing that stands out and she uses certain words and phrases. Those phrases and words were non-existant for the first 100 pages or so. The writing was good enough to keep me going but I could definately tell a difference... especially after reading and loving her other books.After about page 100 the ""it"" hit the fan! Brutal, sexual, violent, funny, and fast paced is what I love and what (part of) this book delivers. Get this book, get here previous books, and get her next one!"
3,Just OK,"I really enjoyed Insatiable, so I thought I would read another book written by Miss Hobbs. I have to say, the book was just OK. The ending was predictable and cute, and parts of the book made me smile. I liked Dayna's character and the strength she gained throughout the book. Reed was disgusting, but I liked that his character was not really what I expected; his instability becomes more and more apparent as you read. Just OK, nothing like Insatiable, which I couldn't put down."
4,TOO REAL,I AM STILL READING THIS BOOK BUT ALMOST DONE. HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW ANYWAY. THIS BOOK SEEMS SO REAL. I NEVER EVER WANT TO MEET A GUY LIKE THIS REED GUY. GOOD BOOK SO FAR. I PLAN ON READ HER 2 OTHER BOOKS ALSO.
2,Do Not Buy The Camera If You Have A Labtop!,I bought this cam because of the quality and I read that it worked well with fast moving objects. What I did not know was that my laptop dose not supplies adequate power to the camera. I found this out when I called the tech support and they told me that it might not work with the laptop because of the power supply.
2,This is the only kitchenaid product I hate...,"I agree with Susan Thorson and M. Taylor ""mtpaperworks"" reviews. I really love Kitchenaid products, especially my professional stand mixer. All of them have worked wonderfully...Except for this one. When it arrived, it seemed high quality: it was very heavy, felt smooth when cutting, and was easy to hold onto. However, within a month, it was having difficulty with certain can sizes. Now it is three months later, and it doesn't successfully open anything. This is not due to blade dullness: the can and can opener won't line up correctly. It was actually easier for me to use a bottle opener to pry open my two cans than to use the can opener. In fact, I got angry and threw it away yesterday! I'm amazed, because I've never had a can opener just go ""kaput"" like this one did.Kitchenaid is a great company overall, but skip this product."
5,Worked great,Saw another poster had problems with a snug fit. With all of these type plugs you need to twist the cam clockwise until you get just below a tight fit. The twisting tightens the screw compressing the rubber grommet a bit to adjust. Than flip the cam to tighten. I bought three so I would have backups but Ive never lost one because I have spares. If I only had one I would likely lose it everytime I took the boat out.
2,A little big...,"Although this scoop / spade is very sturdy - Its ridiculously large for a single serving (and if frozen hard) and for that- its not practical. If someone owned a ice cream parlor, this spade / scoop would be perfect at filling a quart to ""go"". (This tool would be my first choice to get softer gallon ice cream packed into quarts)."
2,Man Boredom,I was very disappointed when I watched this video. The cover suggests great viewing but I never could completely follow the storyline nor understand why the tiger would not eat the little boy. It really tried hard to be a good movie but it just didn't meet my expectations. It's possible that others might find it entertaining.
3,"Good Tiger, No Captions, Bad Cast Credits","Despite the Amazon listing (see ""Format"") the DVD has no closed captions or subtitles, which is unfortunate for about 9 million deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the United States who might otherwise enjoy this film.One further point of irritation: the on-screen cast credits omit all roles (the viewer is given nothing more than an alphabetical list of the actors' names), and they scroll past at quadruple speed (as though the Sci-Fi Channel were in a hurry to get back to the commercials).All in all, a less than bare-bones DVD release."
2,Much too long.,"I have inattentive ADD and do enjoy reading. I can finish most interesting books without a problem. This book is much too long, wordy and goes nowhere. It could be summarized in one page. Basically it says, if you have ADD, get organized and be nice to people. Other than this, it is not much help to anyone with ADD."
1,self-help for dummies,"The authors write: ""Since one of the hallmarks of ADD is impulsivity, you may buy first and think later. Simply being aware of your tendencies may help. Train yourself to stop and think before buying anything..."" [DUH!] ""If impulse buying is a problem, you may have to stay out of stores, cut up your credit cards or plan your shopping trips with an empty wallet!"" If advice like this is helpful to you, then this book is full of it. I found the information here to be too dumbed-down to be useful. The ""simulated subtypes"" offered as examples of adult ADDers were not as helpful as the real people testimonials you will find in ""Driven to Distraction"". If you dont find 12-step programs with their underlying quasi-religious overtones helpful, then this book is not for you."
2,Could've stood MORE detail!,"Looking at this book online it sounded very interesting, but I bought the audio tape and was VERY disappointed. OK, we ADDer's may get impatient with too much detail, but this work didn't have ENOUGH! The authors give basic outline advice, but they don't go much further. In addition, the advice they do give is sometimes rather obvious. I am just beginning learning about adult ADHD, and this book didn't near satisfy my craving for insight and information. It seems once I reach a subject I'm interested in, the authors dump it and move on to another! A fair starting point I guess, but if you want to go deeper, this book doesn't do it."
5,"This is such a useful book, I'm glad it's available on tape",I think this book is so useful and is even easier to listen to on the go! Definitely a must have!
4,really good book,ANY Book that deals with Human situations and how why certain things happen within your mind set its a much needed read.how does one lose interest so soon or have mood swings in the middle of not feeling a thing? this book answered that and thensome. makes you question and look within your own soul and also takes you back to how you did in school or why you were told you weren't always focused or your attention span to detail needed this or that. so many times going through ones daily live and wondering out loud what is wrong with me and why can't i cope or grasp this or that? sometimes you feel that your intelligence doesn't match your placement in things. it can be scary and it can make you feel like everything that you thought you knew doesn't hold a can of beans. very powerful on the Psycological tip.
3,Not too bad,"Picked this one up for more info on ADD. Helpful title for sure, but not terribly impressed beyond that. Definitely has some good insights, but not much new or different than all the other such references out there."
5,Review of ADD book,Great resource for those with ADD I just purchased this again as we lost a copy from a few years ago. Gave to my son to replace the missing copy he had.
1,Couldn't Keep My A(DD)ttention,"The book has FAR more to offer than the audio tape. I bought both and found the book to be informative. However, the audio tape was sooooo boring that neither my ADD boyfriend or I could get through the first side of the two-cassette set. Shame, since he's not much of a reader and he really needs to know more about the subject."
3,"You mean I'm not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!","Great read, I'm in the process, with counselors suggestion - great in sight! The quality of publishing is what I'm giving a low rating, I'm careful with my paperbacks, as I've been reading this book the binding has been separating, poor craftsmanship?"
2,jar junk,This worked for a few openings and then broke. I tried to put it back together only to have it break again.
2,it's only OK,"While I know and like the songs on these CDs, most of them sounded like re-makes. Original artists-yes. But not the ""radio versions"" I expected. Same thing goes for ""Best of the 70's"" boxed set."
4,High volume Electric Fan Replacement for car,"This fan was installed on my two 2000 Lincoln LS's. This, while not a complicated installation, was a bit time consuming. No one has a good installation manual, on electric fan installation. There are a few things to consider: High power engines (and small engines) demand high volume air through the radiator...this fan does that well. The biggest problem will be how to do the install, connection, to various parts and how to avoid finding a fan belt to make the other components all work together, along with the extra parts that you will need to make it work properly. I would recommend an electric fan over OEM fans every time....if they need to be replaced or you are having trouble with them....I don't know if they allow it here, but I can give you parts lists and tips on how to save you time and money, rather then work on hit and miss solutions. $20.00 charge cheap at 4 X that price...lwbro@yahoo.com"
4,Really great parts separated by so-so parts,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said there are some really great chapters separated by some really so-so chapters. Some of the chapters are just too obvious, and seem like better reading for older people who aren't too hip with all the ""modern"" stuff going on. But then there are some really supurb chapters which are closer to up there with the insight of the Kurzweil stuff, etc.Not perfect, but worth reading if you don't mind flipping through a few of the chapters."
4,Interesting,"He gets a bit off the wall towards the end, but overall a great read about the way that the changing face of technology is empowering individuals to do things that it took big companies to do just a few years ago."
5,Entertaining and Insightful,"This is an entertaining and insightful read. While it doesn't claim to be a business book, it certainly has great applicability to businesses great and small. If you are looking for political commentary, this book really doesn't fit the category as some commentators have suggested. Still, this is a book about the empowerment of the individual, something that is inherently pro-liberty. The thought of the rise of individualism clearly is scary to some.As a lawyer, Reynolds is a trained ""issue spotter."" He does not purport to know all of the answers, but the recognition of an issue is the first step to understanding it and capitalizing on it. An Army of Davids does a great job of raising a lot of issues that society, businesses and the ""establishment"" must grapple with over the next twenty years."
1,Cheap Knock Off or Defective,"I have order several Avery products on Amazon, normally they are fine. This one (Heavy Duty 1"") and others I recently purchased (~Sept. 2012) looks like the real thing but is poorly made. I suspect there are fake or defective. The rings do not close properly and the cover cracked within a couple of weeks of minor use. I will not buy another binder on Amazon. I expected more than what I got."
4,Stott,"Lovely video and all three participants move lovely. I have purchased many of Stott DVDs, and Natalia and Kim are my favorites to watch as they make it look so beautiful and the technique is just amazing. Only thing I don't like is that the women in the video are not in the cover of the DVD and I often purchase DVDs just because of the people in it, so I don't like it when the cover model does not match the expert in the DVD"
1,Updating (and downgrading) my original review...,"Bought this because of the ease of use, and at first it was worth the money. It really did open cans easily--comparing it with the OXO brand manual can opener--but the cutter wheel is no easier to clean than any other opener. (Best bet for cleaning the cutter wheel is an old tooth brush sprayed with a non-toxic cleaner such as Simple Green. Rinse the brush, run over the wheel again, and the wheel is reasonably clean.)Now, almost a year later, this Made-in-China can opener no longer works reliably. On many cans, it unpredictably cuts for just an inch or two and then circles round the top, refusing to cut at all. For that reason, I downgrade my rating to one star. This has had the shortest life (in terms of reliable use) of any can opener I've owned."
2,Can Opener - NOT,"Like many other reviewers, I have been sorely disappointed in my KitchenAid can opener. I thought it was just me at first - I thought I knew how to use a can opener, but this one just plain doesn't work. I have to try 3-4-5 times EVERY time I use this thing. Leaves uncut gaps in the lid -shreds the paper off the can and makes a mess on the counter. Keep your money & look elsewhere - this product is not up to the standards you normally associate with the name KitchenAid. I'm looking for a new one."
5,Better than an electric...,This is by far the best can opener I've used in fifty-some years of opening cans. After the first time I used it I retired my old electric to the garbage. The thick handles feel solid and give you a good grip. It cuts through cans like butter. I'm thinking about buying a second one just in case something ever happens to the one I've got. I've had it for about three years and had no problems of any kind. I don't remember if the instructions said you could put it in the dishwasher. I never have because I've wanted to preserve the cutting mechanisms in their superior state. It's easy enough to wash by hand. It's so good I've given it as gifts which says a lot about something so mundane as a can opener.Apparently there exists a lesser model. This is the one you buy alone and which has stainless steel on the handle.
1,So Disappointed!,"I purchased this opener after trying it at a kitchen store...it seemed to have a good feel and turned smoothly. It still does, but those features are of no use when it DOESN'T CUT THE CAN! The roller and the cutter don't stay together, the can doesn't stay gripped, and it takes forever to get one single lid off. I'm gonna throw this away, and go get some cheapie opener, cause it couldn't be any worse..."
1,total crap,The designer of this one blew it. I have to hold this at an acute angle to the can to force my way through the lid. And that doesn't always work without worrying various segments over and over. The 2-cent fold-out can opener in my C-rations used to work better than this piece of you-know-what.After calling them I am quite happy with the results!!!!!Not only did they replace the opener but they provided free return shipping. I guess you can get a lemon anywhere but buying a brand name can show why there is sometimes a premium for the product.
1,a mysteriously horrible product,"It looked like it would work,It turned like a high quality itemIt won't open even 1/6 of a can as a newlypurchased item.Go cheap and shop old time stores forcan openers. This is an over-engineeredbenz-lemon of a can opener.I'm taking it back to Nob Hill tomorrowmorning."
1,spinning out,"Works for about a year then, though it is able to punch into the can, spins in place. I bought this twice, same result. Complete disappointment."
5,Review of Johnny Guitar Blu-Ray,"I pre ordered and received the blu-ray today.....finally my own copy of this American classic!The restoration and transfer are magnificent..................most of the movie looks like it was shot yesterday....this film is known for its color palatte and the rendering of color and image far surpasses any tv version I have ever seen. Watching this blu-ray is like watching Johnny Guitar for the first time. The soundtrack is crystal clear....all in all Olive Films did a great job.In addition to the excellent introduction by Martin Scorsese, I would have liked a commentary track or in depth documentary..............the stories about the making of this movie are the stuff of epic myth..believe me, the negative chemistry off screen between Joan and Mercedes comes through on screen in spades. Mecedes gives a performance for the ages in this film.If you love this movie like I do, this is a must have...............highest possible recommendation."
4,A Stunning Western Psychodrama,"Shot in Republic's Trucolor process, ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954) exists in its own B-movie universe. Director Nicholas Ray's heavily symbolic drama utilizes the Western genre in a subversive manner. Bizarre and sexually intense, the film is a truly unique work that lingers in the memory. The offbeat casting of Joan Crawford, Sterling Hayden and Mercedes McCambridge adds to the psychological depth. Long unavailable on DVD, the Olive Films release looks terrific."
2,poor flash recycling time & viewfinder,"I purchased this camera without testing it first or testing other similar cameras, basically purchased it for the price and small size. I take lots of indoor pictures and the flash recycling time was about 6-7 seconds. (cannon similar camara had 4 sec and olympus has a 0.5-4 sec) I kept missing shots due to the waiting time. I also had to scooch back a few times to take pictures because the camera won't focus at close distances (didn't have trouble with the olympus stylus) Also, it was a little difficult to see through such a small viewfinder."
1,"""Honest"" Cop arrested 3/10/05 for string of murders...","Lou Eppolito was arrested in Las Vegas, along with his NYPD partner, on March 10, 2005 for carrying out a series of mob murders in the 1980s and 1990s while he was a self-proclaimed ""honest"" cop.It turns out he was part of the mob all along, which makes this book quite interesting in that Eppolito had the nerve to write an autobiography that was a complete LIE and sell it to the public anyway!One can fault Eppolito for his life of crime, but one can never say that the man didn't have nerve!"
1,Time for a Post Script!,"Well, the hero was sentenced to life behind bars, 1 million dollar fine, and forfeiture of all his assets. Why?He was a murderer. He was not a hero. He killed killers.Now, his book is fiction. ""Compassionate"" guy? Cold-blooded killer for hire; sociopath, narcissist, and now...just another thug behind bars. Praise for this fiction? No, thanks."
3,Guinea pig igloo,"It is actually bigger than it looks in the pic. I have two guinea pigs, and they can be inside at the same time. It arrived damaged as the entrance tunnel was broken. The plastic is not too hard, and it can be easily folded or even broke. You can actually see your pets inside because the material is not so opaque. Satisfied."
5,Guinea pig hut,The guinea pigs love to use the hut to hid in and eat there food. Great shipping and thanks for making my piggy happy.
3,Not like his early stuff,"If you like the more recent albums by guitarist William Ackerman, which are melodic, quiet, moody, cerebral, and relaxing, then you'll like this album too. If you are like me, however, and you enjoyed his early albums more - e.g., ""In Search of Turtle's Navel,"" which is lively, emotional, and moving - then you will be disappointed. Ackerman is still a master artist, evolving in his craft, so I do not wish to take anything away from him. It's just a matter of taste."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"This book was so much fun to read. Dorah L. Williams has written it just perfectly- she draws you in and is so convincing, you will believe every word of this scary tale. This is not a story about demon possession, as so many haunted house stories end up being. In fact, the majority of her ghosts seem to be children, which makes it all the more interesting. It's a good old fashioned ghost story that just happens to be true- and if you read it at night, you'll definitely find yourself looking over your shoulder!"
2,Super slow,"Not really a lot going on in this book. I think that the person who wrote it truly felt a full sense of suspense because they believe they endured it, but as for a ghost story fan, it was too slow and I eventually put it down. Nothing really ever happens."
5,This is a good read,"I've never been a big believer in the paranormal, but I found this story to be very convincing and told in an entertaining way. It held my attention from the first page."
5,Curiosity gets the cat!,"Wow! A quick read hard to put down. Its not a horror story, its a chilling day by bay account of the weirdness of a residual haunting..."
3,Good n Scarry.,"If you're like me and can't seem to get enough of the paranormal then you might as well add this one to your list. It was a great fast read (one night for a fast reader) but really kept my attention. I'm not really a ""read in one night"" type of person but this stuff really interests me and read really fluently."
2,RAMY Lip Gloss,"Although RAMY goes on smooth, it is over rated - for $24 I expected more and won't buy again"
3,No support for this product,I purchased this product and it would not run. I contacted the people of IMSI and they no longer own this product. They sent a very rude e-mail that asked me not to inquire any further about this product. So I am stuck with a product that does not work. I have used the program before and it is a good program but don't try to use it on an NT machine or win 98. It says it supports NT but it will give you and out of disk space error when you are not out of disk space! There is no help to correct these bugs!
1,Don't waste your time,"If you want to read Margaret Sanger's book, read Margaret Sanger's Pivot of Civilization, as published by Humanity Press or as available on-line, not this chopped up attack on her book by someone with a major agenda."
4,From Rags to Riches,"This is a wonderful play to read. Henry Higgins and Colonel Pickering make a bet that they can take a poor flower girl, Eliza Doolitle, and pass her off as a duchess. The pair teaches her perfect English, manners, and how to dress like a lady. They succeed, but they don't realize Eliza has her own opinions. This play is great because you really get a feel for the early Victorian era and Shaw's feminist views."
4,Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw,"I thought that this book was a thoroughly enjoyable read. The book depicts the common belief of the people in early 20th century London that appearance and stature is far more important than education or beliefs. This belief, although not as extreme today, is still held by many. Shaw uses the two extremes of society at that time to tell a truly fascinating story of a young, poor woman, Eliza Doolittle, who is transformed into a lady of high class and style by a professor of phonetics, Henry Higgins. Although it is a play and it is difficult to know the characters' thoughts, Shaw details their actions to the point that allows the reader to feel they know the characters and feel like they were actually a part of the story. Shaw's combination of humor and expression of feeling perfectly offset each other so that the book never bores the reader. This book is a fairly easy read and gives the reader an accurate account of life in early 20th century London."
3,Another acne treatment,"My oldest kids (17 and 14) have been using this for about a month. It's pretty similar to the Neutrogena kits that are available, as well as any other salicylic based product.I was excited to buy an organic product, although Nature's Gate products often include petroleum based ingredients hidden by their complex names. My kids hated the toner, they said their skin felt like it was coated all day with a film, and couldn't stand using it.So, there's nothing stellar to report here from our experience. It's a typical salicylic product that may or may not be extra gentle based on it organic ingredients.It's certainly no worse than other products."
3,Same product in new package,"This package comes with a face wash, toner and a cream to shmear on as step #3. Each of these can be bought at any pharmacy under various brands. The bottom line is that alltopical acne medication contains the same active ingredient.. Salicylic Acid. In this case.. both the wash and the Step 3 cream contain this. Yes it works to some degree, because Salicylic acid in general works. I have yet to figure out what ""toner"" is or what it does. But it has a nice right to it doesnt it?The makers of this seem to be capitalizing on the ""organic"" craze. If you are the tree hugger type and want your Salicylic acid to be organic instead of non organic then this might be right up your ally. If you dont care about the source of the active ingredient in your acne medicine then safe a few bucks and buy the pharmacy brand of zit zapper."
1,Warning: Rash!!!,"I've tried a lot of products over the years. Even though I don't have sensitive skin I bought this product because of it's all natural/organic image. I have a few blemishes on my face but I've never been happy with the appearance of my skin. I was hoping this product would clear my acne, smooth out my skin and give it a more even tone/feel. I used this product for about 4 days following the directions religiously. After the fourth day my skin became irritated and my face and neck broke out into a red, bumpy, itchy rash that looks and feels like sandpaper. I immediately discontinued use and it has been almost a week and the rash has not cleared up! I've read some reviews where the rash can last up to two/three weeks! not fun! I was highly disappointed in this product and I've tried a lot of different products but none of them have caused me break out in a rash like this one."
3,Longer Term Skin Treatment,"The Natural Results Acne Treatment System clears and improves the skin quite well. This system consists of three products to be used on a daily basis: Step 1, the Corrective Cleanser; Step 2, the Calming Toner; and Step 3, the Controlling Lotion. I found the Corrective Cleanser to be far too drying and irritating on my skin, even when not used daily. However, I have sensitive skin in general, so this product may benefit others better. The Calming Toner is a very pleasant blend of natural oils, among other ingredients, that made my skin feel good. Finally, the Controlling Lotion treated acne well and was not overly drying. Overall, this is a good product, but it requires some personal adjustment as to how often and how much of each product in the system one wishes to use. Also, the Natural Results Acne Treatment System seems to provide a long-term, skin-clearing service, as opposed to a fast-acting, overnight spot treatment."
2,"Gave it the ol' college try, but no go.","Well, I tried to give this product the full 6 weeks, but decided to abort the operation a bit early. I'm in my 40s, have had acne to some degree since I was 9 and have tried everything, including prescription meds. My acne isn't severe, just persistent. This product feels nice, although the toner burns a bit, and doesn't leave my face dry and flaky. The smell is odd, but not unpleasant. The drawback is that now I'm getting blemishes in places where I really never got them before! I've been using this for several weeks, long enough for whatever might be ""lurking"" under my skin to have arrived and disappeared, but am still getting at least as many blemishes as before starting this program. Back to the benzoyl peroxide!"
4,Fabulous,"This soundtrack was well-chosen for the film. In particular, Harry Nilsson's melodramatic ""Without You"" was extremely effective--my movie-going companions and I felt as if we were right there in the scene. Highly recommended for nostalgic 20-somethings who like 70s and 80s punk and brit-pop."
3,Song with Jessica Biel dancing?,"Does anyone know the name of that song that's playing at the beginning of the movie, Jessica Biel's character is wandering through the halls drunk?(this scene) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiaohaoIuFci can't find it, and it's driving me insane!"
3,Missing Artist,I am looking for the name of the german rap group that is played during one of the parties does anyone know? If anyone knows please send an email: chrupertr@yahoo.com. Thanks!
4,Food for Thought,"This writer has brought together a lot of material, but, for me, this was not a smooth read. Maybe it was details (like his wife wanted him to give her ""a park and stock it""... a murder in his church is mentioned and dropped... is he rich or totally in hock?) that made this hard for me to follow from paragraph to paragraph but not on the whole. I agree with another reviewer that pictures, maps (where were these plantations in relations to each other) a family tree, etc. would have helped.I was not aware how difficult it was to emancipate slaves in Revolutionary and Post-Rev. Virginia. All the handwringing of our glorified VA patriots could have been spent stemming manumission laws.. or at least tempering them.It would seem there would be nothing more to say about Lincoln, and pre-emancipation studies are certainly fertile territory. Perhaps Levy's book will inspire more research in this area."
2,Mediocre design,"The level comes with a nail system that is what makes it stand on the walls. The problem is that if you use this nail (in order to use the level as showed in the advertising pictures), you will leave a small, noticeable whole in your wall(!). There is no way of using the graded wheel that forms the base of the level without ""nailing"" it. This makes it very poorly design and only suitable to use fully either in places where you wouldn't mind leaving a small whole or during construction times, when you know the wall your are working will be later be repainted. of course, who would be interested in hanging a picture then?"
5,I LOVE THE KEYBOARD PLAYER CHARLES VEAL JR.,"I saw The Veal Brothers perform ONE time,and they blew me away. It is amazing how such great talent can be put together to form such great music."
5,Everything advertised!,"I purchased this Power Source on the basis of a review in the ARRL magazine, QST. As an amateur radio operator I am concerned with having a reliable power source for emergency situations. This rechargeble power source helps to fill that need. It is also useful in preparing a home for other natural diasters where lighting, communications and powering a cell phone are critical. Upon witnessing the ""find me"" light feature my wife asked for one to put in her office. What I've used most is the flash light which is attached and always at the ready. What is lacking for me is sensitivity in the radio receiver. I don't seem to be able to ""pull in"" some of the radio stations I usually listen to. In a time of emergency though, most all local broadcasters will be heard so this shouldn't be a problem. This storm station is an asset to my home."
3,"Durable, limited in time",This is a rugged book with good pictures of items at the beach. Good for my 18 month old but I think it will lack appeal in a few months.
2,not balanced.,"A love story for the man-made or anthropogenic crowd. Uses many many adjectives to describe the dire consequences that are ""just around the corner.""No balance at all. Al Gore would love this DVD.I gave it a second star because it did spend considerable time discussing temperature variations over the past several hundred million years. This may help the folks who believe that the earth's temperature has not changed for the past billion years.Even the packaging was poor. Worst I have ever encountered."
1,Does not work,I used it for about a month (even though it was all starched and beet up...looks like someone ripped it out of a stolen car) and then it just stopped working. Nothing at all not radio no cd not even the lights and since its been over 30 days I can't return it.
2,egh....,"Mostly bad acting, grainy film, dragged on with the plot, and wasn't really funny when they would make jokes. Not worth the money."
1,buyer beware.....,I purchased this Prince karaoke CD.....much to my surprise.....no lyrics either in the case or on TV...first time I ever purchased from amazon & I am sadly disappointed......
3,No Index Can Be a Problem,"While this small book is very thourough and seems to cover most any food, it has no index in the back, and that can be a problem. Sometimes I just can't find a food using this: it may not be listed in the section I think it should be...and without an index in back, you may not be able to locate it. (I have an older version of this book also, and often used the index. If I wanted to find spagetti exchanges, for instance, all I had to do was look up spagetti in the index and it would show the page number.) It can be frustrating when you need to locate an exchange for a food, but can't find the food in the book.When will the authors of exchange books realize that what folks who go by food exchanges need is a book with all foods simply listed in alphabetical order, with their exchanges beside them??? When one needs to quickly find an exchange, there's nothing that beats being able to find the foods in alphabetical order!"
3,"Cherone's in da house, but where's Halen?","Or, for that matter, where's Extreme? Hey, don't get me wrong, there are some biting tunes on this CD record album that hit home in a big way, and Cherone puts his usual poignant touch on the lyrics, but I wonder if the beefed-up sound of Halen is what's missing here. Heck, even the members of Extreme might have jacked up the sound a notch or two on this record.Cherone comes up with odd song titles, but it's his gig, man, he can do what he pleases at this stage of his career. Ever since Halen fired him, this man has been doing whatever he pleases, and usually the results work...usually.By the way, is it Roth or Hagar who is reuniting with Halen? Halen's web site is a little unclear at this point, and you can never trust the journalists on MTV. Maybe I'll check out Ryan Seacrest's show tomorrow afternoon to get the full scoop.HAVE A GOOD DAY!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Elvis has not made an exit but he has left the planet,Good music but a bad title! Elvis has left the Planet but a new King has been born with the self proclaimed new King of Rock and Roll Ken Rondell at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigran
3,maybe I was sent the wrong book?,I like hearing anyone discuss cameras and techniques except sheep. It seems the newer generation(now old) of cinematographers say exactly what their peers say. 1)Hollywood bad 2)minimalism good 3)Thank God for faster film/ available light 4)newer lenses are too sharp? 5)My lower region fell asleep6) that's not an entirely bad thing.
3,Good Movie with some weak parts,"All in all I liked this movie, however, there were some inconsistencies between scenes. The viewer had a to make a lot of assumptions so if you missed pieces of the movie it could be confusing."
3,"not my cup of tea, but.....","not my cup of tea, but the special effects were AMAZING!Really more for teenagers, but the summary sounded interesting so I checked it out.The main character reminded me too much of a certain lead wolf of a certain series of movies....The script could have been stronger. I felt I was missing too much information and background on the characters. They kinda just threw you in the middle and let you flounder around for scraps of info."
3,Should have sucked,"You know, this is one of those movies that had every reason to suck. I only went to see it because there was nothing else showing. But I have to say that it surprised me. Sure it's a silly movie with absurdly beautiful people everywhere. Still, if you like this genre you might check it out. It's not nearly as lame as it could have been. Renny Harlin is hit or miss but he delivered a lot of movie on a pretty thin premise."
4,Nude Ipswitch Male Student Rave,"A next movie of a who-knows-what-for mix of modern cars and Dark Age stories slightly watch-able for comic hints deploying some same gender affairs, handsome young actors not ashamed to strip before cameras and techno-tricks substituted a real human professionalism of Jackie Chan et al.Something likeThe Lost Boysbut even lesser sensible."
2,Energy Ball - Attack,"I found this movie extremely boring. Plot, actors, and special effects were mostly on the lame side. There were only ever 2 girls in the dorm? I didn't care who won in the end."
3,S&K Birdhouse and Heath Outdoor 15 foot pole,The Heath Outdoor Products 15 foot telecoping Galvanized Pole does not fit the S&K Birdhouse. They are listed together on the Amazon site. S&K makes a special pole for this birdhouse. I purchased this Heath Outdoor Products pole with the S&K Birdhouse from Amazon and I had to return the Heath 15 foot telecoping pole.
2,Always read two books on any subject,"A wise man once told me to always read at least two books on any subject to avoid any intentional or unintentional biases of the author. the other book I would recommend that you all read with McCarthy's book is ""The Gospel according to James McCarthy"" by Gary Michuta. All you kids behave now, or I'll stop this car right now."
4,Catholic apologists are lying pigs,"Reading the pretend ""reviews"" from the bloody harlot's defenders(Rev 17) it is clear they are liars who didn't even read the book. I give the book only 4-stars because McCarthy was TOO ""charitable"" towards a cult and persecuter of God's people, a system of abominable idolatry, homosexuality, violence, bloodshed, war and the like. Cathlolics would be far more honest if they'd just admit they follow MAN and not God's Word, and that they follow a bunch of Italian men, a spiritual mafia out of Rome."
1,The Gospel by James McCarthy?,"An honest, scholarly rebuttal that made this book like a work of fiction, ""The Gospel According to James McCarthy"" by Gary Michuta thru Amazon.Read and learn logical reasoning."
2,one word.. TRADITION,Everything cannot be explained by The Bible Alone!Tradition and Oral teaching gives us The Bible.. We need both; like two lungs in one body.If the Bible is the final Word on Everything... What about the first 3 or 4 generations of Christians?
5,This is the Stuff!,"If you buy this expecting the flavor of a warm-from-the-oven New York Deli cheesecake, then yes, you are out of luck. If you're looking for the same taste you get from the Jello No Bake cheesecake products, this is it.Prep and bake time for warm-from-the-oven New York Deli cheesecake..... about 1.5 hours....taste points 10.Total time from box to table for Jell-O Instant Pudding & Pie Filling Cheesecake....about 30-seconds....taste points 8."
1,Yuck!!!,"Do yourselves a favor and don't buy this. I bought it thinking that it would taste like Jello cheescake filling, but it doesn't. Now I'm stuck with a bunch of it. You may as well buy vanilla flavor. Also, it tastes a bit salty to me. Save your money, pass on this."
3,for completists only,"The whole ""song titles that also happend to be first line of every song"" should have been a clue that Richard Buckner didn't really put the same effort into this album as he has in the past...or maybe he was emulating Emily Dickenson, I don't know. What I can tell you is that out of all of my Richard Buckner albums, this is the one that I listen to the least. That being said, even subpar Richard Buckner is still pretty darn good. Much of what we expect from him is still here: the late night initimate hushed vocal delivery, the cryptic lyrics, and clean & crisp production. What's not here are any memorable tunes. There's a quality of sameness that kind of runs through the whole album that you don't hear with his best albums like ""Devotion & Doubt"" and ""Bloomed"". It's not a bad album, but unless you've already purchased the aforementioned pair, there's no need to buy this one."
2,"Truly, R.B has reached an Impasse","Sad enough i think our sad sack buckner has reached an impasse. That little flame has definetly sputtered into mediocrisy. There is simply too much i could criticize on this release. This is buckner's pop record, and imho, it doesn't even stand up to his previous releases, except the pompous little nursery rhyme adaptation of the spoon river anthology. Don't even get me started, but even books have chapters! None the less, i still believe in this artist, and after his recent divorce his best may be yet to come..."
3,mmm I thought it will be something else,"some times when you buy stuff just because of a name, and did not encouter it before, so be ready for the unexpected."
5,Captivating,"I was shopping in a store in Berkeley several years ago and they happened to be playing this album. I had never heard anything like it so I asked what the album was. The saleswoman had to go upstairs to find out and I'm so glad she did. It was my introduction to Windham Hill which led me to several of their artists who have become my favorites (particularly Nightnoise and Metamora) and many more of their albums that I now have. As other reviewers here have noted, the music is perfect background music for dinner parties, holidays or anytime you want to feel mellow. I particularly like the pieces with minor key fiddle music that remind me of pioneer folk music. I didn't hesitate to buy it after hearing a few of the songs. The samples here should convince you too."
2,Not soft,My three old would rather play with her soft little mommy doll. This doll is sensitive on how to get her to talk and is not soft to hold and cuddle. She loves the little mommy dolls that cost around $10.
3,"I didn't find it worthy but most reviews says otherwise :). For me, it was irritating...","I bought it on the basis of positive reviews on various sites. I have 2yr old toddler girl who loves dolls. I thought it would be great fun for her as well as for us to watch the two interacting and playing together.I opened the parcel on delivery and did the required steps which were easy enough and gave a name to the doll. Soon after that, the doll started furnishing the requests. Now, in the ads I have seen doll asking for things but it came as monotonous and repetitive. She just keep on asking things frustrating every one of us. Any yes, it's more a machine than a doll. It's every part is motorized so don't expect it to be loved by toddler as they normally do with a ""normal"" doll."
2,Freaky Doll!,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old daughter; she liked it until it started demanding a little too much in it's very CREEPY baby voice. She did not see the charm and it has since been placed in a drawer where my daughter says she needs to ""sleep."" We did managed to scare a friend by placing the doll in her backseat without her knowing; great for laughs and the doll was hurled out the driver's side window with much force and it still works (groan)!"
5,great doll,"We gave this doll to our 4 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She plays with it all the time. The doll has many requests and responses and our daughter is quite able to put the blanket,teddy bear, and bottle into the correct places for the magnets to hold with the doll's hands. My sister gave her a doll carrier (pretend car seat carrier) for Christmas as well and it has been very convenient to hold the doll and all of her items."
5,Wish I had one growing up,"Baby is so adorable and very soft voice. Very sweet because she doesn't cry when you don't listen to her requests, she just sighs. Still finding new surprise responses from her. Love how she moves her head and arms when communicating. Very cute but price tag is pretty high. Glad we found a good deal. Bought from mbbookworm and had great service. Highly recommended seller"
4,A Precious Doll,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves the verbal interaction. Her voice is very clear and her peek-a-boo actions and giggles are very cute. When you record her name be sure to go to a quiet area of the house. This should be done by an adult. Any little girl will love this doll. I do and I'm all grown up. I was concerned that this is a ""mattel toy under the Fisher Price name"", however, she was not on any recall list I could find.Grandma Nita"
1,Totally my fault!,"From the other review mentioning how great the price was and the 'first' one was still working - I assumed this was a sleeve of batteries. I normally pay $2.99 to $4.99 tops for this battery in the name brand. This is an off brand at $11.58 for one! Not the sellers fault, my assumption - but understand this is not even close to being a fair price."
2,Not good at all!,These don't fit as well as the Holmes brand and they are not as absorbent. They are only effective for about a week.Buy Holmes filters!
4,"good piece, but not ideal","The item is good and does what it should. no problem there. However, this amount of magnification just distorts the image rather than enhancing it."
5,Great purse toy,I got this to throw in the diaper bag or my large purse. My daughter loved to do the puzzles and they kept her busy while waiting in restaurants.
4,Mature Audience only,"This isnt a clothes on sort of example. They are of course naked, and very much ""doing it"". It isn't raunchy but there is nothing left to imagine, they show everything, sometimes up close. Honestly, its a good thing. There are some books/videos that try to make do and fall short. They do explain technicality, they explain technique, they explain who feels what, where, and why. There are a few ""advanced"" positions for those who are limber or um ""gifted"" enough, but otherwise is for the average couple looking for something new. Been a while since I seen it but there is no fluid exchange (understand where I going with this?) and they portrait the female as an equal as much as she should be. Actually I think they focus on lifting her up and giving her more focus, which is good for everyone right? For what it is, its tasteful.I like the random positions option the best."
1,Claptrap,"Self-styled Nostradamus experts are forever telling us what various quatrains mean, but it is always AFTER the events predicted. For example, one quatrain predicts the attack on 9/11, if you squint your eyes just so and hold your mouth just right. It's all based on astrology, which erroneously describes the stars going around the earth.What I have never seen is one clear, specific Nostradamus prediction BEFORE the event. Riddles just are not helpful. Supposedly various seers, including Nostradamus, have predicted the world will end on or about December 20-1, 2012. Now, that's specific. So should everyone hold off on their Christmas shopping to see what happens? I think not.This DVD is one big joke with weirdos pretending to great wisdom, speaking pseudo-scientific claptrap. I wasted my time on it. Don't waste yours."
4,La...but PRAYER?!,"I recently played the musical accomaniment for this entire show in a local production. I fell absolutely in love with the music and have been singing along with the original and encore recordings since...Sir Percy's ""Prayer"" is always going to be my favorite. One may imagine my disappointment when I discovered Prayer was missing from the book! And ""Madame Guillotine"" is practically the equivalent to Jekyll and Hyde's thunderous ""Facade"" and should have definitely been included. Even the relatively short reprises of ""When I Look at You"" and ""Where's the Girl?"" would have been awesome additions! I love Pimpernel too much to rate this book anything less than a '4' but I'm crossing my fingers to soon see a new edition that includes EVERYTHING from the show. Even the new material from the Encore version!!"
3,Price is Right?,"I purchased this product because of the very low price and it even included the cable I needed to hookup to my Sony Video Camera. Little did I know that the cable would not work, no matter how much fiddling with it, just did not want to work. I picked up another cable and it worked just fine. Also, one of the Firewire ports did not work, had to use the other one. Normally, this would probably be a ONE STAR review, but, I got what I paid for, the USB ports seem to be working just fine and I did have one other firewire port that DID WORK, so I really can't complain, still a very good deal for the money. I guess there might be some of these that work just fine, that would be a GREAT deal, but, not mine, just a good deal. I didn't pursue getting a replacement because I got what I needed with this and just don't need that many USB/FireWire ports anyhow. Not a big deal actually, at least not for me."
2,Defective product,The transaction was smooth but the product was defective as the CD on which the software was loaded had been scratched to the point that it would not load.
1,Sabrent USB-UF6 6-port,Purchased as a christmas gift but was defective. I returned it to the manufacturer with relative ease and prompty received a refund.
5,The Best Bike Tire I've Seen For Many Years,"After many years of buying cheap bike tires from drug stores, Walmart, etc. I wanted something better without paying more. When I checked out Amazon Marketplace I ordered this tire, then discovered it's quality to be superior to anything since they were made in America. This is a quality tire in every way, and inexpensive too."
2,Good bin for BIG Dog,"The storage bin itself works great, but meant for XL Dog's food. Says that it can hold alot, but both bin sizes in general are HUGE! Not something to keep out, but put in pantry. Gave to XL dog's family & they say it works alright but they don't use scoop."
3,"Works well, feels cheap","Installed this dimmer over year ago and it works fine, but both the push-button switch and the dimmer slide feel cheap. There's a lot of jiggle."
4,From Hero to Has-Been,"""Columbus: The Lost Voyage"" covers the little-known, or at least, little-discussed last of his four trips to North America. Everyone knows about the first, but he made three more, the final one resulting in utter failure.Columbus encountered numerous problems, ranging from a hurricane to hostile natives to shipwrecks to hostile Spaniards(!) to mutiny. The program decribes this last voyage as a disaster and I would have to agree. Columbus's aim was to find that elusive passage to the Orient, yet it escaped him, replaced instead by the many hardships he suffered mentioned above. In the end he lost all four of his deterating ships to the elements and had to pay for his passage back to Spain with his own money! Within two years of returning Columbus died, a broken man; an inglorious end for the person who started a new age in history.Four stars. Interesting story. Columbus serves as a vivid reminder that all glory is fleeting..."
4,Still too far from the mystery,Again Saylor's latest book lets us into the character Gordianus and his father more but doesn't fit strongly into the mystery category. So if you haven't read the other books and are expecting a mystery you may be disappointed. There is less politics in this one and we meet some intriguing characters who may stick around in later books.
4,better than stock,"Ordering was easy and received quickly. This wick has metal around the outside keeping it from sagging inside the humidifier. I was able to find one unit locally but glad I ordered a second. Even with the metal to help them last longer, we still need to replace the wick."
4,A social comentary of our times,Thought provocing lyrics well written and strikes a chord with younger and older listeners takes a couple of listens to get into and may be a bit to Australian oriented (but is that a bad thing)
5,Better than Britney,"My favorite line is ""Now I'm convinced that you are from Mars."" Better than Britney"
5,Looks and works great,Very nice bracket for the price. The white looks nice on the white porch post. We used the screws that came with the bracket and they worked fine. Very pleased.
4,"Good bracket, but use your own screws",Not much to say that already hasn't been written - this is a decent quality aluminum bracket. But don't even try to use the screws that come with it. Invest a couple of bucks in some decent screws - the ones provided will strip right away.
2,Just OK. Needs to be updated.,Thought this physician's book would be a good resource. I recommend you look for a book that is more up to date.
4,THIS WAS A FREAKY FLIK !,"I ENJOYED THIS DVD. IT WAS FUNNY & FREAKY. WHAT A MOCK JOB ! IF YOU LIKED THE ORIGINAL, YOU'LL LOVE THE COMEDY IN THIS SATIRACLE DVD. I STILL LAUGH WHEN I THINK OF IT !! ENJOY !!"
1,Failed at shooting fish in a barrel,"If you think Twilight was bad, this makes it look like an Academy Award winner... The level of bathroom humor is similar to what you would hear in a kindergarten classroom... at the same time the sex jokes (that definitely make this inappropriate for most of the preteen audience that drools over Twilight) are very grown up but are entirely vulgar. The makers went too far off in left field with this one. There is so much to poke fun at in the Twilight series that they ignored to just go off and throw random, vulgar, and immature jokes in. They literally failed at shooting fish in a barrel."
1,possibly the worst movie ever,"Just watched it on netflix(on the wii). It was a total waste of my hour, it wasn't even a good spoof. HORRIBLE writing, camera work and acting(worse acting then twilight!) Don't waste your time or money on this!"
1,"Oh, please.","What in the world is Amazon thinking, let this piece of tripe be sold to unsuspecting customers? This looks a high school film project, not a seventeen dollar movie. If you want to see a Twilight parody that is actually worth something, check out the Hillywood Show parody on YouTube.Twilight is not that hard to make fun of, but somehow you guys epically failed."
3,too many pieces,"We orderd this to take along on vacation and although it is a great too in theory, there are way too many pieces (and they are quite small) and can easily get lost. Some of the words could fall under two different letters (ex. is the teddy bear T for teddy or B for bear? and the the violin looks more like a guitar). Great idea, but not so great in the end."
2,Too slow,"I have used other graphics software, but got this with my Acer scanner. The results are good, but it takes too long in between steps. When I first tried it, I thought it had frozen up, but I have since found, it is just slow! I have a 500 Mhz processer, so I know it's not my machine. Right now, I'm looking for new software to use. Love my scanner, hate the Ulead software."
3,Voltage Regulator 1200VA,"Nice unit but I ordered the wrong one.I needed a 120 volt unit but was sent a 220 Volt unit my mistake! Beware that the LE1200I and the ( I )stands for International,"
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I've been saying, since about the time of ""The Little Mermaid,"" that you can't go far wrong with a Disney animated feature. They're not all masterpieces, but they all deliver good solid entertainment.Okay, I guess I was wrong.""Home On the Range"" is the most disappointing Disney theatrical feature I've seen since the bitter dregs of the '70s. I wanted to like it. Technically, the film is well-executed. The animation is skillfully done. Artistically, however, the film is sadly lacking. The jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't engaging, the songs aren't memorable, and the story is dull. Was this a direct-to-video project that got rushed into theaters instead?"
5,Love it!,This is an overlooked Disney gem at a great price. Must have for the collection. Do not pass this deal up.
4,Good children's film,This is a good film for children. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with young children in the home.
3,"My kids love it, whatelse matters?","I am in that period of my life where I am watching a lot of children's programming. The tendency is to start to impose my own adult tastes on these children's movies. I think this is because the bar has been raised with Shrek and other movies that plant plenty of jokes for the parents.The problem with Home on the Range is the adult jokes are just mildly humorous. The joke does not as much make you laugh as it makes you say to yourself, ""Oh yes, they are trying to make me laugh. Cute.""Well guess what, that does not really matter. I have a four year old little girl that loves horses and a two year old boy who loves whatever his sister loves. They talk about that movie non-stop. And they have only seen it twice!Heaven help me. When the DVD comes out, I will see it another 2...hundred times!!Bottom line. The people who should like this movie do, not some grown-up reviewing kid's movies with the same scrutiny of a Sundance entry."
2,Not so good,"This has to be one of the worst of the Disney Cartoons. It was not a very smart movie it was ment for kids 3-6. That is about it. Many of the others are 'smart' cartoons that the whole family would enjoy. It felt very Warner Brothers.The issue I have is that Disney stated that no one was going to see the 'cartoon movies' anymore. That is only because they haven't written/drawn a 'smart' movie for a long time. People are looking for another Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan,and Little Mermaid. This movie doesn't match up to those.It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. I was dissapointed and I am a HUGE Disney fan!"
2,"Better than Nemo and Brother Bear, but lacking....","Disney/Pixar... (Yes I know they are no longer cooperating) seem to be producing many bad films as of late. Since their blatent rip off of Kimba: The White Lion (Lion King) the quality of their movies went down the drain. Although I don't like many of the early Disney Films they were still more quality than the newer films. Anyway, this film ""Home on the Range"" was funny at times but the few laughs were not enough to keep snyone intertained for any period of timeAnimation 4/10Story 5/10Music 7/10Humor 5/10Replay Value 2/10Age 3-10 (Maybe as old as 14 but probably not)However compared to Finding Nemo and Brother Bear this movie is 10 times better than the two of those combined. Watch Beauty and the Beast, Phinnocchino (Spelling?), Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away or others. I love animated films and for children the quality just needs to be 100%.... not the 40% of this movie or the 10% of Nemo.. Thanks!!!!!1"
5,i loved it,this was a verry funny movie me and my mom laughed through out the hole moovie for a great funny family moovie i loved this movie and both of the ice ages
3,A Seldom Known Disney Cartoon... It's Okay,"This movie has upbeat animation and likeable characters. It's a story about three cows who go on this adventure in the old west to save their farm from a fat, wanted outlaw. They meet a few friends along the way, there's a betrayal, and the cows have human-like personalities, which is quite funny. However, the story seemed rushed and the characters didn't have enough time to become fully developed I thought. I wouldn't rate it up there with say, The Lion King, for example, but it might still entertain the kids nevertheless."
2,Just Right Fluff,"This book says that people of any color can dance, love animals, appreciate art of different types, different food, ride the subway. I fail to see why anyone but Pollyanna would think it is so good. Beyond the subjects stated, I waited for substance to develop but it did not. Twenty-six pages of fluff, it was bought as a gift but I have changed my mind."
5,"Lively instrumentals, incredible guitar - very relaxing","This is one of my favorite Govi CDs. His masterful guitar instrumentals, and exquisite compositional style, combine to provide a lively, yet relaxing, aura that's uplifting and inspiring. I also use this particular CD in our art galleries. We have many customers in the galleries who simply love Govi's work."
5,A Fabulous Artist,"I first heard this music in a waiting room of a doctor. Normally the background music was tuned to the local Classical Station. I would often think the music was fine but too much chit chat from the DJ's. So when I heard the Govi, I had to know who this artist was. I LOVED the music. For me it was thoughtful, relaxing, uplifing and inspiring. I went out and bought two CD's. After that I got every Govi I could find. Friends are always asking about this music. Sometimes you will find a CD that has a couple of good songs among the group, but I have found that I really enjoy them all. I do have my favorites. I would highly reccomend any of the Govi CD's."
4,That's for girls!!,"My grandson (almost 4) was browsing through videos on my kindle. This one came up and he said, ""That's for girls"", and then accidently brought it up. Turns out he sat still and watched the whole thing. If he sat still that long, it has to mean he liked it. And because he liked it, so did grandma!"
1,Useless,"Hi, I've been purchasing products from amazon.com for so many years, and they worked well must of them but this product in particular KENSINGTON 64058 PC KEY USB SECURITY DEVICE it just doesn't work. I contacted the manufacturer company regarding troubleshoot and I've been told that product is discontinued it is not for sale anymore and as far as they know nobody has the same kind of product on the market, I have also been trying to get reinbursed for the last 2 weeks I called the company myselfand they promised to send me a return label buy I havent had any good luck."
3,Road of Gold,Enjoyed the quick read and like the story line. Left me a little short on excitement. Love the inside scoup of the military mind.
5,The real sound of nature on piano,Best solo piano i've heard. The author composed this album on location
4,Excellent Movie.,"I love Indian movies and I am a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I have seen almost all his movies. I have seen bad movies however, this is not one of them."
3,Interesting but poorly written,"I was assigned this book for a criminial justice course on profiling, and while I find the content interesting, the book itself is hard to read because the writing is bad. I *think* the authors are trying to state veiled opinions about the 'hotshots' of the FBI and what they would call 'proper' use of criminal profiling, but the language is stilted and I just end up confused as to their intent. That coupled with the misuse of the word 'affect' (instead of 'effect') within the first ten pages! Therefore, if you're looking for a well-written, thought-provoking text, this isn't it, but it can provide some interesting commentary on the state of profiling today."
1,Go for the real stuff first,"Go for real stuff first. Miles ""In a Silent Way."" Terry Riley's stuff is so much deeper than this, particularly his middle period and Sri Camel. Steve Tibbetts stuff blows this away, all of Steve Tibbets stuff. Eno is more interesting. Sorry to his fans, just the truth. Jon Hassell is a more interesting trumpet player and composer, almost all of his output. Bill Nelson makes very interesting home made ""new age."" If you have heard the above six you probably are going to be bored by Isham. Unless you want really bland and boring. Many of the above have peaceful music that is not bland. Most have ""new age"" that is really thought provoking and more innovative."
3,Quick Review,"I got this book to help get a head start with a university course. I'm new to Visual Basic so I thought this book would be a great help. It was, I was disapointed that some of the code quoted in the book did not work. Most notably the example on reading the contents of a file in chapter 4. It actually puts the path and filename into your little wordprocessor window. Got to admit I got extremely good with the online Visual Basic Help facility. I made it work eventually, I'm now on weekend number 2. Overall it achieves it's purpose, but that early glitch caused some concern over the rest of the text."
1,Author Didn't Review/Debug his Own Code!,"This book starts out with an interest and plausible concept: to teach the reader the fundamentals of VB6 in a weekend. And it would be able to accomplish this task in at least a ""four-star"" fashion if the author and/or publisher had attempted to review the code for errors and debug the code. From chapter 22 onward the code errors are so serious that one cannot run the sample program since one uncorrected error builds on another (and coding errors are simple repeated in the code on the included CD) the book becomes practically impossible to follow along by coding on your own computer after chapter 22. What's worse, the publisher does not publish an errata on their website for this book."
4,New spin on traditional prayer,"Celtic prayer is inspiring for its earthiness and conviction of the presence of God in daily life. This contempory prayer book rises out of a new monastic form, a contemporary ""decentralized"" mixed gender Christian committed life. It is inspiring, thoughtful and a valuable asset...however, I can't help but wonder why the traditional ""Daily Office"" (Matins, Lauds, Prime, None, Sext Vespers & Compline) needed to be replaced. This is a useful addition, but not a replacement."
2,If you like Taize?,"If you like the syncretism of Taize, you will like this book. The actual morning and evening prayers take up very few pages. The rest is a mish-mash of home-made ""services"" and quotes from some ancient Celtic sources, but too many modern new age style ""thinkers"". And I still wonder why Nelson Mandela is included? Is he a bearer of Celtic spirituality?? Very very strange! 2 stars for the nice DJ.... :-)"
5,A Must for Nightly Prayer,"This book is so full of information and meditations it's hard to put into words. With three years of readings, it encompasses so much. Anyone wanting a good book for daily reading and short devotionals w/prayer should consider acquiring this book."
2,Chauvinist tripe,"At first, I really enjoyed reading this book. I totally agreed with the theory of ""The Love Bank."" I found the lists of priorities men and women attach to their marriage very interesting (and enlightening).But as the book went on, I couldn't help rolling my eyes in disgust at the chauvinist comments the author would make. I mean, do you really have to be submissive and helpless to be a good Christian wife?Given how much I agreed with the importance of your partner being your companion during activities you enjoy, I was disappointed with how Harley approached the activities, the solutions, and the inevitable ""boys will be boys"" attitude he espoused.Most of this book is common sense. Will it really affair-proof your marriage? I doubt it. It'll either happen or it won't. If you act like a jerk, you may get cheated on. If you marry a jerk, you may get cheated on. Other than that, there are no guarantees.Instead of reading this book, go out and spend some time with your spouse."
2,outdated,the overall theme was how not to have an affair. the material was outdated although the point is still useful.
1,Maybe they should reconsider the byline...,This book was often used in the sermons of my former pastor and his former wife at a church I attended in high school. It was touted as the only book you need for a happy marriage. Even the youth group was encouraged to read it so that we would know what to do when we found a mate. That pastor later had an affair with one of the married women in his congregation and is now divorced. And that's all I've got to say about that.
3,Don't remember?,Don't remember this purchase/ Maybe was not me. Or mine. Don't think this was my purchase. ASny idea how long ago
4,Interesting Point of View,"I found it a bit simplistic to reduce a marriage to a set of needs that could be met or unmet. That's what behaviorist theory preaches and so far it has worked in other areas of psychology. Reading within that context, it makes sense that if you fullfill your spouse's needs, there won't be affairs. Quite optimistic!"
5,Practical Advice for Couples,This book should be required reading for engaged and newly married couples. Dr Harley is one of the few marriage couselors that actually teaches you how to make your marriage work instead of just identifying the problems. Make sure and check out Dr. Harley's web site www.marriagebuilders.com. Great information here.
1,Justifies affairs,"I hated this book. It says quite strongly that if you're not meeing ALL your spouse's needs ALL the time, they may ""fall victim"" to an affair. It is a kind of emotional blackmail. None of us is perfect at meeting our spouse's needs. While I encourage communication about these needs, it is awful to use any shortcomings (which we all have) to justify a spouse's straying."
1,A Disaster,"A woman is nothing but an object,nothing more than somethingfor the man to enjoy.He says women are interested in emotionalsecurity and not much else.Sex is placed at the bottom of thelist for women.It's not good advice but an array of oldsterotypes we still believe to this day in the 21st century!Marriage is a trade off,the man buys the woman with gifts anda booming bank account,the woman gets the man to notice her bybeing his slave and sex object.Sadly many people have fallenprey to this thinking within some churches.The lord and mastervs servant and slave."
4,"Sad, but true.","This is a very sad story, but any semi-serious violinist will find it very interesting. Although most likely Anthony Feinstein wrote all he learned of Michael's life, I would have enjoyed more details of the virtuoso's personal history. Still, Feinstein writes an impressive, detailed story of Michael' journey as a performer. It makes you wish Michael could have gotten emotional wholeness and enjoyed his career and life more. It also makes you wonder about all the other virtuoso performers of any instrument, especially the child prodigies."
1,Misleading,"""The Best"" of C.M. Kornbluth contains two short stories, neither of which is his best known work ""The Marching Morons."" Even at $1.99, I hardly felt this was worth the purchase price. If you're looking for a good compilation of Kornbluth stories, I'd suggest ""Eight Worlds of C.M. Kornbluth"" instead.UPDATE: I've heard the print version actually does have more stories. However, I've only purchased the Kindle version, and can say that the Kindle version only has two. So, the print version may be worth the money (I personally don't know), but the Kindle version is not."
2,too noisy,Amazason shipped an used one to me! The noise is too big. Not that good as looked in the picture.
2,"Works, but hardly",To get this thing to work properly its a little bit painful but i can get it to work if I fight through the pain. This just isn't a powerful set of clippers and should simply not be purchased. Spend the e3xtra 15 bucks and get a peanut from wahl. I wish so badly i had done this
4,"Good album, but Amazon screwed the ripping process up","If you like this album I would go elseware to download, or just buy the CD from Amazon. It is obvious that whomever ripped it did not bother to QA the digital copies because all of the songs have skips in them. I downloaded it then called to report this and all they did was refund my purchase.I hope its fixed at some point because this is a good album for fans of power/heavy metal.cheers"
2,Not as expected,I agree with some of the other reviewers - don't get this book unless you want *everything* on this subject - this is written by a person that really doesn't understand the concepts behind why most people get pierced. Also - you'll get more pics and illustrations in your average tattoo mag.
1,Where is the illustrations?,"First off this book has hardly any illustratons. It has no business claiming to be a complete illustrated guide to anything. The photographs seem to be taken all off the same shop, as if they are just an advertisement for Streamline Tattoo. While they are some nice tattoos there are a tun of great artists within driving distance of that shop. The only person who would enjoy this book would be a somebody with no idea about tattoos or piercings. A person with no knowledge of the industry (as if they were living on mars) may find this useful. I'm returning my copy. I feel it is not, what it was represented to be. I was very disapointed."
5,Cute Tea Set,I gave this to my niece for her 2nd birthday and it was simply adorable. She plays with it all the time and the cloth makes it a perfect toy for a young child. I would recommend this to anyone with a young girl.
3,MST3000,"Not as good as a lot of the other episodes of MST3000, but it's hard not to like their running commentary even when the movie itself is soooo bad."
2,Not Scobe's best work,"The title of this book says it all - MORON - As in I feel like a MORON for spending money for this book. The print is so large and lacking content that anyone can read this book in under 2 hours. There are a few humorous moments, but in sum, the book is lacking substance and disappointing. Save your money!"
1,A Waste of Money,"This book doesn't show you how to do any of the projects... Both of my kids (son and daughter) read through the book and thought how worthless. Even if you think something looks cool, it doesn't include instructions. The photo's do not show the whole room.For example... looking at ""Back in the Saddle"" page 60-61, where's the bed? There isn't one. Where does she sleep? on the floor next to the horse posters and fake plastic hedges? But they made sure she has a picnic basket! And where's the plans for the stables? Even if they oncluded the plans, my teenagers could never build this stable (even if you could figure out where to put a bed)!What a big disappointment. We wish we could return it and get our money back. You should try to check this one out at the library so you don't through away your money...it's not a keeper."
2,This was a BORING book!!,"This book was on my high school summer reading list and I think that this was not an appropriate book for a freshman reading list. I thought that I would try to be optimistic about the books but I found it very very boring, although I like one chapter in the book. The problem with that chapter was it basically summarized the whole book, and I still had about 10 chapters to go!!"
4,Handsome Feeder,"This is a very nice bird feeder. One must devise a way to make it squirrel-proof, otherwise a squirrel will destroy it."
1,Didn't last long,It looks great but the squirrels were able to take this apart within a month. I would buy something else instead.

2,Too big to big practical,"This scoop looked like something I could use, but it turned out to be enormous. It wouldn't fit easily into my 4 qt pot. I could think of no use for it in my kitchen."
5,To Know Her by Name author Lori Wick,"The book was exactly as described and that was as ""very good."" It was sent right away, so the timing was great as well. Give the sender a good report. Thank You CM"
5,To Know Her by Name,This is a heart winning story of a young woman who makes the best out of a bad situation while keeping her beliefs and morals in tack. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone who likes Christian adventure in fiction form.
3,Tough read,"I love classic book and romance even more but I found this to be a tough one. Partly because I am not from Australia so many of the words were foreign to me. I found that tone frustrating and I had a hard time visualizing characters. The whole love saga with Cardinal Ralph just irritated me. I understand forbidden love but I couldn't stand the way he taunted her feelings.There was a lot of death and sadness which made for a realistic and meaningful read but the worst part of it all the the ending!!SPOILER ALERTThe last part of the book I found to be a travesty. The death of Meggi's so was confusing and just unnecessary. Drowning? Really?! The writing before, during, and after that was sketchy. I had to re read the section over and over again because I felt like I was missing something.Basically, if you have a lot of extra time on your hands than go for it but other than that...you're not missing much."
5,"Beautiful plot, beautifully written piece of literature","I must admit that I did shed more that a few tears on reading this book. Often, popular books either have a good plot or else they are well written...well this one had both of them combined. Wonderful!!!"
5,I simply had to read the book,"This is a long read, but very well written, it keeps you glued to each page. So far, as I have been reading, it does not follow the movie, but it is still a tremendous book. It would be a shame for anyone not to read this. I am enjoying it to the fullest!!!!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"There are several books that stand out in my mind: Lonesome Dove, Gone with the Wind, The Rise of T. Roosevelt, and The Thorn Birds. I became interested in this novel after watching the mini-series. Now they really do not make mini-series like that anymore. I loved Rachel Ward (although she's not that great an actress) and Mancini's music (famous for also writing the Pink Panther and MoonRiver songs).Read the book. If you don't like romance novels... we'll this novel isn't just about the ""girl"" and the priest."
3,A Disappointment,"Although I love William Bennett, I had a hard time with this book. The writing is not very good at all. If you are looking for a book on American History that is fair and balanced, I recommend Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. It is beautifully written and very comprehensive."
2,I love Johnny...however I hate this Movie!,"Johnny Depp is one of the most versitle, uniquely weird yet brilliant actors around. He's nice to look at as well, but Secret Window is a pure disapointment. Yes, this movie begins with a classic plot and moves along rather smoothly as you become involved in the rather bizarre happenings. You begin to sympathize with Depps character but then the ending just makes the entire movie stupid! When the credits begin to roll, you sit there asking yourself why you watched this stupid movie in the first place."
2,The only good thing - Depp,This movie is so predicatable and gets boring after a while. Depp's acting is the best part of this mess.
2,Two solid performances wasted in this boring un-thriller,"There are plenty of reviews of ""Secret Window"" so I'm not going to rehash the plot. I'll just tell you that the movie is a criminal waste of Johnny Depp and John Turturo's talents.Turturo is sufficiently menacing. Depp is believable as the eccentric protagonist. The movie has an interesting premise -- a manacing southerner accuses a reclusive author of stealing his story. The problem is that ""Secret Window"" telegraphs it's uninteresting ""twist"" ending so early that anyone who's seen the Sixth Sense, Identity, the Others, etc. will see it coming a mile away.The ending is totally predictable, unsatisfying and not half as clever as it thinks it is. I'd have given this movie one star if it weren't for Depp and Turturo. As it is, they elevate a movie that could've absolutely sucked to a level of boring forgetability.I can imagine enjoying ""Secret Window"" on cable on a hungover Sunday afternoon, but it's really not even worth a rental."
3,Well done but predictable,"Secret Window stars Johnny Depp as Mort, a writer living reclusively after breaking up with his wife. His already troubled state is made worse when a sinister character (John Turturro) shows up at his door claiming that Mort plagiarized one of his stories. It turns out that the two stories are very similar, but who stole it from whom? Both Depp and Turturro are interesting and versatile actors, and both give great performances here. The first half of the movie was so suspenseful and engrossing that I was disappointed when it turned very predictable, and in a way reminiscent of several other recent films. The acting, photography and direction are good throughout, but the script falling back on an overused gimmick prevents this film from rising above the ordinary."
4,"Remember, it's a Stephen King scenario.","After I saw 'Dreamcathcer', I thought I would never see another Stephen King-influenced film. But I did. And I wasn't disappointed. 'Secret Window', contrary to all pre-conceptions, satisfies the audience.The film starts rather slowly. One morning, a man dressed fully in black knocks on Depp's door. He claims that Depp stole his story, accusing him with plagiarism. Though he seems to be extraordinarily serious about this. Indeed, he is. Things start happening, and Depp thinks that he needs to do something, before this mad guy kills him for a reason other than plagiarism, which he can't comprehend.The film's end is a big surprise, and I think you won't be able to guess it beforehand. But, after seeing the end, I just smiled, and bowed before King's genius.Not a masterpiece, but still a good movie that you can get engaged with, and have a good time."
5,Johnny Depp+Stephen King...What's not to Like?,"Johnny Depp, the greatest actor in modern cinema, transforms from the brillaint scalliwag Jack Sparrow into the secluded writer Mort Rainey in this adaptation of Stephen King's short story. This film garnered mixed reviews throughout 2004, but after seeing it, I have no idea why. From start to finish, Depp's performance intrigues, from the ridiculous attire he wears at home to the cynical comments he makes to others. The plot, as would be expected from a Stephen King story, is well crafted, and it builds progressively from start to finish. In the end, the viewer is satisfied by a sweet, dark ending that Stephen King is so renowned for creating. Secret Window was probably the most overlooked great film that 2004 had to offer."
4,"Secret window has no secrets, but who cares","The secret window is a very clever movie that I enjoyed a lot. Johnny Depp once again shows why he is one of the great actors of our time. He played this role very well as a writer who is struggling with his divorce from his wife. Depps wife, played by Maria Bello, has had an affair and is now with the man with whom she had the affair. Depp begins getting a visit from a Mississippi farmer named Shooter claiming Depp stole one of his stories and changed the ending. Without giving away too much the Man begins to torment Depp so he will admit to stealing his story.The acting in this movie was very good as well as visualization. The person that plays shooter does a very good job. The is very predictable but that should detour you from getting this movie it is still good"
3,Uncomfortable...and funny,"This movie was so bizarre, it couldn't really easily be classified: horror, thriller, comedy, drama, action...it was strange! Me and my mom were cracking up most of the time, not because of bad writing or acting, but just because it was hilarious! The line about waking up and ""finding your wife nailed to the garbage bin""-said in a Mississippi accent was a scream. Depp was excellent, as always, as a neurotic grungy writer, but unfortunately couldn't carry this movie. When I say watching this was ""uncomfortable"" I mean that it never got scary, but sometimes I felt unsettled. The scene where he's upstairs thinking that Shooter was in his bathroom was one of these times. I did however, think the scene where we found out what was REALLY going on, was extremely well done. I recommend renting it,just for Depp, *could he be anymore handsome or talented?* But other than that, Shooter will get annoying, your interest will wear thin, and you won't really care what happens to his ex."
3,Everyone Drops the Dime,"Johnny Depp was an excellent choice for the lead in this film adaptation of ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"", a novella by Stephen King. Tim Hutton was also a great choice for supporting actor. The chemistry between the two is mezmorizing and really quite well directed.The story moves slowly, but for good reason. There are some story points in the beginning that would be overlooked if the action moved too quickly or if there was a lot of visual razzle-dazzle. It allows you to pay attention so you'll remember when the plot twists, and boy does it twist. Without spoiling the movie, I'll just say you're unwittingly rooting for the bad guy.If you're looking for a gory horror film like so many other King films, this isn't it. This is an intelligent, thoughtful and suspensful story. A story. Not a movie. While it's not Carrie or Christine, its carefully thought out plot works well as a feature-length film."
3,Regurgitated King,"If I hadn't seen that ""Secret Window"" was adapted from a Stephen King story I wouldn't have been surprised. This flick just smacks of deja vu. It's not bad King but it's not particularly great. The blocked writer in a remote setting with murder and mayhem ensuing is just so familiar. What elevates the film beyond the mundane are game performances by Johnny Depp as the harried writer and John Turturro delivering an inspired turn straight from ""Night of the Hunter"". Maria Bello looks hot but essentially wasted. Forgettable in the near extreme."
4,Worth seeing,"After seeing the previews for this movie, I didn't really want to watch it. But it had a few surprises in store and was well done. Certainly worth watching."
1,This Should Have Remained a Secret,"I enjoy Johnny Depp, I think he's a great actor. That being said, I wonder what could have possibly posessed him to sign on to this project. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. There's nothing original about it. It tries so hard to be thrilling and cerebral...but it fails miserably. You'll know exactly what's going to happen twenty minutes in. You'll only be scared by how bored you are.Save yourself some time and money and leave this one alone."
2,Johnny can't save this movie,"Though short, Secret Window still felt dragging at times. Its a weird type of movie where nothing really makes sense yet you know exactly what is going to happen less than halfway thru. Nothing is really a surprise here. I don't even know what genre to categorize this film into. Its not a horror nor was it really suspenseful. Its just sort of an annoying and unnecessary film, lacking in charisma and a real plot."
4,"""The only thing that matters is the ending.""","I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed Johnny Depp's portrayal of Mort. He got Mort's interdivorce lazyness down pretty good, though his mood wasn't really that comical in the book. John Shooter's character was done excellently. Very nice. The movie went very swiftly and barelled towards the ending, which was somewhat different than in the book. I won't bore you with the petty details, but I liked how he brought the story full circle in the end, by giving it that perfect ending. If there were parts, little parts, people didn't fully get, read ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" by Stephen King. But for now, this is by far one of the better movies based off of a Stephen King movie."
1,Should have stayed a secret,"This movie has one redeeming quality, well two. Depp ain't bad and the ground level premise of the two stories ""The Secret Window"" being similiar ain't bad either, but beyond that, what we have here is a monstrous mess. Whoever cast the role of the Mississippi 'guy', the townsfolk, the maid, the sheriff, etc., should now be unemployed. Awful acting, hammy, and anything else you can dream up that is b-a-d. Extras? When a movie is this poorly made, who cares. I found my local rental store has this movie miscategorized, it should be under comedy. If you are still looking for a 'new' suspense/horror movie on par with the Ring, keep looking."
5,Awesome movie,"It's true that I am both a Stephen King and a Johnny Depp fan and that may have biased my opinion of this movie a bit, but I honestly think I would've liked the movie anyway because the plot was fantastic and the acting superb. I read the story years ago and pretty much knew what was going to happen, but it was great seeing Johnny as Mort and there was still the sweet element of ""wow"" near the end there when the secrets of the movie are revealed.Some movies I walk away thinking, ""I want the last two hours of my life back!"". But this one was entertaining throughout and I consider it time well spent. My 11 and 13 year old children liked it too, and their attention spans are not held by boring, slow paced movies."
4,Wow!Johnny Depp at his best...,"This movie really has a nice plot to it and I love susspenseful movies and this one tops it off big time!I took a day off from college on Friday, March 12, 2004.I went with my friend Ryan, my rooomate at TCU.We went to the movies and saw this.I thought it was scary and had a good swing to it.Of course, this is based on a Stephen King novella, and Stephen King comes up with these ideas like ""It"" and ""The Green Mile"".I really likje this movies since my major is writing, but I also want to be a director.John Turturro is also at his best.I liked John in Mr.Deeds and Anger Management, but I would of never pictured him in a thriller like this.And Johnny Depp is a great star in this movie.He was also good in, ""Pirates of the Carribean:The Curse of the Black Pearl"", ""Edward Scissor hands, and ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""Anybody with a thing for scary and suspenseful movies, SEE THIS!!!!"
4,"Go see it! It's different from ""Pirates,"" but worth it","... I think this is another typically odd Johnny Depp movie worth your time & money. It is not fast-moving, but psychological. The logline should be: ""Jekyll and Hyde"" -- or ""A Beautiful Mind"" -- meets ""The Children of the Corn."""
2,The Secret Window,I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp AND Stephen King. I wasn't expecting this movie to be so... CORNY!!!! Muahhaha ha hahahahaaahhhh!
2,Decent but not Johnny Depp's best.,"Fine, and somewhat scary film that has a another good performance from Johnny Depp but is very predicable in certain scenes, and the ending is much to be deserved. If you see it, see it for Depp's performance but I suggest you wait for video instead."
5,Secret Window,Johnny Depp did a terrific job. This movie is a great thriller for those who like psychological type suspense movies. Would highly recommend if you are a Johnny Depp fan! :-)
3,The REAL Playlist,"THE NAGIC OF OLD BLUE EYES is very good Sinatra. However, if you are looking for any of the specific songs listed in Amazon's product description you will be disappointed as I was. I bought it specifically to obtain Sinatra's rare rendition of ""Over the Rainbow."" Don't get your hopes up because it isn't on this CD. Not only that, Amazon lists 20 tracks. I have the CD before me as I type this. There are only 10 tracks, and they are: 1) Personality 2) Tea For Two 3) The Night We Called a Day 4) You'll Never Know 5) Dream When You're Feeling Blue 6) Day By Day 7) The Things We Did Last Summer 8) The Coffee Song 9) Time After Time 10) Fools Rush In. So if you're looking for the songs I have listed, this is the CD for you. A fine collection, just not the compilation that Amazon lists."
4,Misleading subtitle. What about the content? ...nothing new.,"The subtitle is completely misleading, it's not ""the definitive history of infinity"" at all, indeed it's not even a history of infinity (actually, it only has two chapters on this subject).The book is just another (very well written, by the way) popular science book which talks about general relativity, quantum mechanics, time-travel, big-bang, worm holes, etc. So if you have already read others books on this subject (as the ones of Kaku, Hawking, etc.) you won't find much new information.But, in case you are really interested in a ""History of Infinity"", get the marvelous Rudy Rucker's book ""Infinity and the Mind""."
4,Bearing the Cross,"Enjoyed the reading history of MLK, the SCLC, problems between the SCLC and NCAAP, and most important the detailed account of MLK. Every family should read what MLK did for EVERYONE. Truly, he had a vision for society."
5,The Stanislaski Brothers,"I am in love with the Stanislaski Brothers. What a wonderful, heartwarming and loving family, the rich characters of Yuri and Nadia, the heart of this remarkable family, their sons Mikhail and Alexi, daughters Rachael and Natasha are memorizing. Mikhail and Stacey, Alexi and Bess love stories are every woman's fantasy. The story is so full of emotion and romance that you will not be able to put it down. Another Nora Roberts winner."
3,my review,"Tha Stanislaski family has escaped from the Ukraine and arrived safely in New York City, where they begin a new life.Fast forward about thirty years and there is Mikhail Stanislaski and his brother, Alex. One is an artist and the younger one is a policeman.Both suddenly encounter two women who will change their lifes.As usual, Nora Roberts makes us forget the grind of daily life and transports us to a wonderful world of romance. I have always enjoyed her novels for the way they make me feel. Her characters are always perfect and very lively.Good read for any time you need a ""refresh""!"
2,Vengaboys new single not so great,"The Vengaboys new single ""Uncle John from Jamacia"" isnt so great.. The 1st two singles from the Platinum album were the best but the content of this song is so stupid but it does KINDA have a good beat.... Vengaboys can do a better job than this can't they?Thanx, Ryan"
3,Tries to do too much,"Oh yes, this film has some problems. The base plot of a German man doing research on the cause of the Aids virus who then gets sidetracked by some loosely related murders is fine. What goes wrong is the plot takes so many false turns. Opens doors that go no where and makes leaps that seem like poor editing (or writing) that it is easy to get lost. To further confuse us, the main character gets involved with a dangerous type that has some never explained ties to the whole issue he is researching and perhaps even the murders.This film simply tries to do too much. Watch it with that in mind and it will be okay. Trivia! The lead female detective has the most annoying voice I have ever heard. Like nails on a blackboard."
1,Ordered 2 -,"I ordered 2 of these. One is DOA (doesn't work at all) and the other is missing a bulb.Also, there is no on/off switch. They can only be turned off by unplugging the cord which will make it awkward to control once put into place."
2,Half a song???,"My favorite Rollins song ""Don't Stop the Carnival"" has been edited! Why do they fade-in during the MIDDLE of the tune and deprive us of the blistering intro shown in the movie??? A HUGE disappointment!"
3,Good book for stereo mike techniques.,"This book is about stereo mike techniques for recording orchestral performances and live concerts, but doesn't provide much info on recording location sound i.e. film sound if that's what you're looking for."
2,ross root feeder,Ross Root Feeders are a good product but this model is too light weight for dry clay soil and will break at the neck. Have had a heavier weight feeder and it has preformed very well over the years.
2,Not worth the trouble,"I purchased this when my daughter was born and it worked perfectly for about 6 months. It was accurate and dependable. The battery died and they are not replaceable! I ordered another one on Amazon and couldn't wait to get it. I received it and the new one didn't even come on, battery was dead. I returned it and exchanged it for another one figuring must be some fluke. The next one I received was dead too! I sent it back for a refund and bought a new tub with temperature strip right in it. Perfect! Great little item if it worked but not worth the trouble and you don't know how long it is going to last you?"
3,"display works, but lights don't",the digital temp display works on this but the lights to show if its too hot or too cold do not work.
1,Did not last,The pump worked okay for a couple of months last year. I took it out of the fountain in the fall and stored it in the garage over the winter. I put it back in the fountain this spring and it didn't operate at all.
1,Becket 325 pump,"I bought this pump for a small pond only comes on 5 hours a day summer time only ,I remove pump and store away for winter . The first one lasted two summers , This one only lasted last summer and a couple days this spring . It died like the last one , I will buy from a different company and would tell all of you reading this to do the same."
3,cord is 16' not 20',"I bought this same model three years ago and now it's failed (keeps tripping the GFI receptacle, which I proved to be good) so I ordered the same model number. But now they make the cord 16' long when it used be 20' long. The description above still says 20' (on 6/15/11) but the actual package says 16'. I need the full 20' so I returned it (no hassle). I'll have to find a pump with a longer cord."
5,Must-Have for a BIonicle Fan,"For any fan of bionicle, new or old,any age, this is a great book. It covers the past, when the turaga were actually toa on a different island! I don't want to spoil too much, but if you want to know more, go to www.bzpower.com Its a great website, you really should sign up!~MTW~(Martin the Warrior)"
4,Great Quality BUT ITS HUGE so I had to return.,Just WAY TO BIG FOR CATS. Would be good for a very LARGE DOG or used to supply water to a large group of animals.
5,great book!!!!!,this book is great and gives wonderful information and facts....worth the money and is a great buy.
1,Coral Photo-Paint 9,I cannot review something I never recieved...AND I can't get my money back......Will never shop here again...
4,"Short, but pleasant.","I downloaded this for my Kindle upon arrival at work, and was finished just prior to leaving -- disappointing because I would have liked it to have lasted at least two shifts. Clever, at times heartening, and clearly written by someone who appreciates the finer uses of the comma. It gave me at least two or three important ideas, and I highlighted a score of entries -- enough to justify the $."
3,Is he getting rich off these books?,"A quick sarcastic read. There were some funny bits, but I couldn't help but wonder if cranking out this kind of humor was really worth $9.99. If the author really wanted to ""not get rich"" he should donate his proceeds to charity. :-)"
4,We have two,My wife has two of these one at the vacation home. They need to be blown up occasionally but she seems to like them both. The other is a different brand rated elsewhere.
4,"Good book, better than anything on Sage help page","This really does answer questions for me, a novice, on how to navigate, and does so as expected in a user friendly format, although I am no dummy (so I hope). It is well laid out, and organized.Like I indicate above in the review title, it exceeds the help from the Sage site itself."
3,"Not the greatest quality print; lots of dirt marks, scratches","This is not a review of the movie itself but of the picture quality on this ""Billy Graham Presents"" DVD edition. While it is certainly watchable there are scads of scratches, marks, etc., especially on the right side of the screen. This is definitely not a remastered movie nor one that had the best print source quality. If it's the only way you could see this movie, then this DVD version is passable, but there is an additional DVD that is more expensive that may have been produced from a finer picture quality source."
2,disappointment,"I've read the book, over and over again. Called it my bible. I was looking forward so much to watch the video.BUY THE BOOK, even if you are a slow reader or rather put your nose in the Donald Duck magazine. It's so easy to read.The video is very hard to follow and the story is changed in a way, I don't think Corrie would approve.(But thatn again she was a good woman.)If you still want to see the movie, FIRST read the book, than see the video"

4,Seeing Stars,"Edwin Howard's ""Seeing Stars"" enables one to pick a favorite star celebrity and to discover what it's really like to have a one-on-one conversation with them. From the silent stars (Lillian Gish) to Martin Sheen (West Wing) and all the others in between, Edwin gets us up close to the star.For example, I learned how John Grisham deals with unexpected celebrity; John Wayne's political views and his thoughts on ballet (yes, ballet!) Howard doesn't mince words, he tells of his interviews with the stars in a ""what you see is what you get"" kind of manner. He has learned how to get close to famous people and earn their trust but as veteran newspaperman his writing rings true."
4,it's good,"You already knew it was a good game becuase it's Final Fantasy, probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games.This one is probably a little worse than the best Final Fantasy games (such as III and VII) but, despite that, what you have here is a Game Boy Advance RPG that has graphics that actually aren't that bad, and the storyline is pretty good too. You just can't go wrong with Final Fantasy games."
5,I wish I could give this 10 stars!,"I've been a fan of Tuck and Patti's for about 11 years now, and I always get a thrill listening to Tuck's guitar work. This is one of my very favorite Christmas CDs and gets a lot of playing time in December. If you're tired of being beat over the head with same old cheesy Christmas arrangements then you need to get this CD. It's mellow, groovin, original, and thoroughly enjoyable. 10 stars for Tuck!!"
5,I love this CD!,"This is a very pretty acoustic guitar music. It's nice to hear Christmas Carols in a new way. Very relaxing. Great for driving, entertaining or for listening to at work."
3,Messy but enjoyable,"Dragon Dynasty finally releases something from Stephen Chow. What we get is the Royal Tramp films which are really just one long film.Chow is young and charming and Sharla Cheung(the queen mother) is a stunning beauty but the films are all over the place. The first film is an enjoyable, early 90's Chinese comedy. The second film gets messy with too many new characters continually being introduced and confusing plot twists. The second film gets pretty stupid and is not near as funny or entertaining.Not a bad release from Dragon Dynasty. They certainly have done worse."
5,Happy with my purchase,"It was easy to assemble, It has more power than my old machine. I have cut the grass three times and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Read This!!!,"This is a pretty lousy movie. The people who gave it 5 stars have to be the makers, others who participated in it's making, or their mothers. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's in the same 'hood. The blooper out-takes are so much more entertaining than the movie is. The story is an uninspired ""life in da hood"" story, but with zombies, to make it more marketable. These guys deserve some credit for the effort, and the basic story idea could make a good film, but this ain't it. It does have a few decent moments, especially in the second half, when it gains some momentum, but unless you're willing to look for the best in this pathetic, mostly amateur little movie, don't waste your money or time. I got it for a penny, plus S+H and lost a mere 90 minutes of my life to watch it. I'll chalk it up to experience and move on with my life now."
4,Country Classics - John Anderson,"I bought this CD for my boyfriend, all I heard for about a month before this is how he really wanted the CD, so I suprised him with it! Great CD!"
1,Don't buy,I received this item and out of the first two disk I could only watch half of the movies. There is some kind of problem with it and two movies on each were not able to be watched. I haven't tried the other disk yet but so far the quality isn't any good.
5,This book will rivet your attention!!!,"""Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."" This is the diary of a young man who is compelled to learn that the preceeding is an ""old lie,"" and who survives the lesson while serving in the blood and excrement of WWI."
3,"Good, not great","I bought this shrink-wrapped from a local book store. Had I been able to flip through, I probably would have passed it by. As Clem says in his review, this collection of Dr. Sproul's writings is not an apologetic of the doctrine of Sola Scriptura, but rather ""more about integrating the concept theologically within the overall reformed structure."" I agree 100% with this assessment.The writing is - as always - superb. Dr. Sproul is a learned and intelligent man and it certainly shows! I did find this book to be a bit of a disappointment, however, solely because I expected something different.So-so. If you can get it used or from the library, do so!"
5,"Moving, great message","A lovely book about a boy who revels in trapping fireflies, but then realizes, as he sees them lose their light and liveliness in the jar, that he needs to give them their freedom. After releasing them, he cries and smiles at the same time. The writing is lyrical, the pictures subtle in gradations of gray. Highly recommended."
5,Fireflies,I am a teacher and have been using this book with my 3rd graders for a few years now. They can make many connections with this book and can infer and make predictions when the story is done. It is a great book because they've all got some story to tell about catching fireflies.
4,Scary with a lot of surprises,"This movie surprised me. It's a taut, well-constructed drama with a thriller/horror twist. Highly recommend!"
2,It's okay,Very easy to clean filters are easy enough to replace..However it is very loud..It could be quieter I have an infant and it wakes him when he sleeps
3,Don't blame language,"This book gives an interesting overview of logical fallacies common in today's political arena. Unfortunately, the author impunes language rather than logic in the erroneous title: ""Fallacies and pitfalls of language: the language trap."" There is little in the book to support a hypothesis that language is the culprit in the examples cited; in each case, it is a logical fallacy that causes problems.As an introductory book in logic, this volume is similar to others. It focuses primarily of religious and political arguments, rather than interpersonal matters, as do most such books.I would recommend this book to those already familiar with logic who want some additional examples."
5,So Beautiful!,This is an amazing piece of art. It should belong to anyone who has a child. I always give it as a new baby gift... love love love it!
4,Excellent general reference on American Indian costume.,"This book is the best general guide I've ever seen to the different costume practices of each major North American Indian tribal group. The book has only two significant drawbacks for the general reader: not enough illustrations (though many are rare photographs almost 100 years old) and unclear chronology. All tribes' costume changed after European contact and such contact occurred at different times for different areas; these factors can make it challenging to pick the relevant information from the text. However, I still learned a lot from this book."
5,It is a good book.,"I like it very much, the information is very informative, the pictures are nice and clear, the pages are thick and firm."
3,nice booklet,I found this nice little booklet in an english bookstore in downtown Amsterdam. This booklet is only 16 pages long. Each page is in full color with a few simple text lines each.I must note that the story is quite different then the animated feature. This little booklet makes a nice gift for any child who likes Disney's Aladdin
2,Lilac Standard Classique Sof Cushioned Toilet Seat,This cushion is very cheap and the toilet seat is not comfortable to sit on there is not enough cushion on this seat.
3,How-to guide with screenshots,"This book is really an extended user manual that does provide more information than the product's own user guide, but there are very few discoveries to be made whilst reading this book. Many sections of the book are simply descriptions of the product's features."
4,interesting advanced course,"I am a highly proficient Latina speaker already, but purchased it to expand my childrens' listening ability particularly with regard to South Americans. I enjoyed the fact that speakers were from different countries, I enjoyed the topics of conversation as well. The course also points out which phrases are used in what part of the world , such as Spain vs Latin America. The only downside was that one of the conversations on the CD is Not in the book, and that there were not more CDs and more topics and conversations. I would love to listen to more of this course, but it's only a 3 CD set . It's very good to hear people in normal conversations with all of the flaws that we have when we speak."
5,Great introduction for youngsters or seniors to computing.,"Bought the book for a senior friend of mine who bought a computer and learned to use it for email but nothing else. After reading through the book, he's gettting into the web, doing word processing and burning discs. Now his grandson is getting into it as well. Would recommend this to anyone who is new to computing."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought that this video definetely brought beauty, grace, and drama, to the normal figure skating fan. The only little problem that i had was that in the Ladies' competition, they only focused on Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan. I wish that there were other ladies to watch as well, like some more on Nicole Bobek, Tanja Scepshenko, Surya Bonaly, Vanessa Gusmeroli... many more. But the pairs competiton was beautiful: Mandy Woetsel/Ingo Steur had a program i would never forget, and Kazakova/Dimitriev had a great performance as well. Besides the little flaw with the ladies competition, this video will delight any fan of the Figure Skating World. I cant wait for Salt Lake City in 2002."
3,An almost... but not quite good story,The book has its thrilling parts... but not always.The plot could be predictable... if you pay attention to it.The grieve for Maria is fine... but harping.The love of his kids is beautiful... and just that.The very end of the book is... good enough.
4,PrettySmile563,"I purchased this book for a friend who is currently in prison. He is a big fan of James Patterson and he stated that the book was ""Off da chain"". He is awaiting the next book Double Cross. Thanks for the timely shipping."
3,used book james patterson's CROSS,"First time I bought a used book from this seller the book was a good price but condition was not great.Pages of book were dirty, like they had eaten on the book and left the scrums in the books pages. (greasy too)readable, but would not be buying again for a bargain.thanksc.m.w."
4,The Dragonslayer Continues,It's been a while since I have read a Patterson novel and it did not disappoint. His story lines always keeps you hooked.I think I am getting to be an adrenaline junkie because I could have done without some of the mushy stuff.
2,What happened to read all night!,I am very disappointed in this book. I expected a can't put it down read as with his other Alex Cross books. Usually I finish within three-four days but this one took me over a month. I couldn't wait to finally read a book he had written by himself once again but with this one I could of waited until it came out in paperback...Judge for yourself...
1,horrible,"Has the reading public truly sunk to the level that this drivel is considered quality entertainment? My 11 year old could spin a better tale than this!The plot: transparentThe characters: unbelievable, paper thin and engaged in stilted conversationNo suspense, no plot twists; in fact, I kept reading out of sheer disbelief. If this is a sample representing James Patterson's typical writing, how did he even land a book deal?I think the movie verions of the books have been intriguing and the producers were lucky enough to cast wonderful actors in the roles, but let's not forget - just because you might love Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross doesn't mean the book is a good book."
4,What's not to like?,"Alex Cross is a likeable hero. He is in the dangerous business of tracking down pathological criminals, but he's also the loving father of three young children. He has an occasional flirtation, but basically he's still in love with his wife Maria who was shot ten years ago by a maniacal murderer and died in his arms. He's smart and ruthless when it comes to tracking down the bad guys, but he's sweet and loving when with his grandmother and his children. The criminals Alex chases are really bad guys--especially the Butcher who is his opponent in this book. James Patterson writes fast-moving prose in short chapters which seem to fly by. Again Patterson uses his winning formula to create a wonderful hero and an awful villain who parry and thrust in a fascinating cat-and-mouse game. So, what's not to like?"
5,Great Book!,This is the first James Patterson book that I have read and it's great! Don't understand the bad reviews though. This book does what it's supposed to- take you away into another place or into a characters shoes and this is exactly what it does. I can't wait to read the rest of his work.Danni
2,Man's book,I bought this book for our book club. I hope you like murders. Although it was a fast read and thankfully James Patterson wasn't too descriptive it is definitely a man's book. I didn't think it was worth the time.
3,ok read,Not a book I enjoyed because I don't care for murder and graphic descriptions of such. Too gorey for me but I read it for our book club so I was committed to finishing it. Surprises abound throughout!
2,disappointed,"I have read every Alex Cross book in order and I was disappointedthat in ""Cross"" Patterson is repeating chapters from previous books.It would be fine if this was the first Cross book I was reading but forall the fans who read all the books it's a cop out.As I started reading I swore I read it before- - -as it turns out I did- -in his earlier books!His biggest fans want NEW material!!"
2,My first Patterson dissappointment,"I was introduced to Patterson in the summer of '06 with Beach Road. I literally did not put it down from cover to cover. Every one of his books I've managed to get my hands on since then has been the same; intensely engaging throughout the book all the way to the bombshell twist at the end. I never fail to wake up my boyfriend when I sit up straight in bed, gasping at the newest surprise ending. While Cross was average in keeping my attention; I was not enthralled. The book ended on such a predictable, mundane note, I don't know that I'd go back to the Cross series. I'm excited for 6th to get back to the Patterson I love."
4,Better Cross,"I swore off Alex Cross for a while because I found the character FAR too unbelievable in his gushy perfection. I decided to take another try with this novel. It is definitely less gushy and annoying but I can't say I am a Cross fan. It still seemed that the plot for Alex was a bit too contrived. Having said that, however, I was still entertained by Cross. Having to do a good deal of professional reading, that is perfectly acceptable to me. If I pick up a novel, I want to be entertained. I do not expect my socks knocked off but simply to be engaged enough that I enjoy the novel. Patterson was successful in doing that. This book is not a ""gripping, page-turner"" but is certainly worth reading."
4,LandDawg,"At least he wrote this one on his own. Good read. I thought he left Cross' kids dangling a little too much. I wondered at times, if he had written them out. Worth the $$."
1,patterson has lost it,I am an avid reader of the alex cross series but it is clear that patterson has lost complete interest in him. I bought this as an audio book and I thought I was going to go crazy if I had to listen to the dialog about how much he loved Maria one more time. What a waste of 30$.
3,Does no one else remember this is isn't how his wife died?????,"Am I wrong but in every other book where he mentions Alex's wife dying, wasn't she running to a 7-11 type place for milk when it was robbed and she was killed in there????? I know I have read this explanation for Maria's death in more than one Alex Cross novel."
3,Patterson is slipping,"Although this book was still enjoyable, and I will still be getting the next Alex Cross book, I can't help but think that Patterson is concentrating too much on quantity and not enough on quality these days. Comparing Along Came a Spider or any earlier books with his recent in this series, the books just don't seem to have the quality of writing that they used to. I used to wait impatiently for the next in the series, but I am now content to occupy my time reading Michael Connolly and others while waiting for the Cross books to go to paperback."
2,Wanted to love it but only liked it (a little) .....,"I was excited to read ""Cross,"" as I had read two of James Patterson's earlier works, and enjoyed them both. However, I was pretty disappointed with this one. While I thought the book was faced-paced and the plot moved quickly with all the action (murder, rape, murder, rape, murder, rape, etc.), I found the writing quite bad and even laughable at times.I also felt there were a number of details that were never explained, such as where his youngest child came from? Perhaps I would know that from reading his other works, although if one were to pick up this book as I did without knowing the main character, such details should not be overlooked.Overall, even though I did enjoy certain aspects of this book, I have a hard time recommending it. If you're a fan of serial-killer, suspense-type, action novels, you may enjoy this one, although you will have to look past the writing style a bit to really enjoy it."
3,Helpful if you have no idea what your purpose is,"The first half of the book was the most helpful to me. The second half I found to be a bit tedious and boring. If you have reached that stage of life where you are questioning your purpose in life, this book may help you get started in understanding why you feel that way and how to begin to unravel your confusion."
1,Out of Control,"I've read other books by this author and normally I'm impressed, but after working for over a year with anger management teens, I can tell you that this author left out a lot of holes in her plot. Teens do not suddenly snap into violence, there is a reason behind. If this book was written more from Brig's point of view, showing the reason to why he got to this point rather then just saying he didn't like her, it would be much better. Rollo and Candy followed their friend without thinking of the consequences, Brig had the actual reason. She did a good job showing Valerie's emotions, but other then that, there were too many holes for me to enjoy this book or actually say it was an accurate description of teen anger. Because Rollo wasn't the one with the anger - Brig was."
4,Frighteningly realistic,"Not one of Mrs.Mazer's best,but it's still worth reading. It shows the lurid reality of sexual assault that many young women face today. Simply because she was an outcast,Valerie was singled out for harassment. But you get to look into the boys' minds,too. I sympathized with Rollo,which I couldn't do otherwise. He was a nice guy who jumped on the bandwagon. He stupidly kept annoying Valerie with phone calls,but he did try to apologize. Although your friends might do something that seems fun,it's not always prudent to join in.In this case,someone was hurt by it. Although the book does give moral lessons,it was fun to read. If you want a provocative read that makes you think,I reccomend this book."
5,Earplugs that work,I love these earplugs! I need to wear earplugs everynight due to my husband's snoring problem. My ears have been sore due to earplugs in the past and don't work very well. I have not had a problem with my ears since using this brand. My husband is getting help for his snoring but in the meantime there is no sense making him feel bad over something he can't help - this in some ways has been a marriage saver.
4,Better then I expected.,"I am a huge fan of The Blair Witch Project, so any movie directed by Ed or Dan (the 2 behind Blair) is a must-see for me. So it was no surprise that I was quick to pick up Solstice when it came out. The acting is good and even though its a typical good looking young cast, the story is anything but generic. The movie is enjoyable to watch and delivers a couple good chills. Its not really comparable to Blair Witch at all... In fact, i'm told this movie is actually a remake of a 2003 film from another country. I've never seen the original so I can't say which one is better, but if you enjoy minimal horror movies then this would probably be up your alley."
2,Last of their great era,"This was clearly a time when the band was heading in the ""break up"" period. The albums before this one though, were perhaps some of the greatest Rock ever written. I still do not feel that SMITH got the credit that band's such as Zeplin, Van Halen, kiss etc., recieved. And if there was a better lineup of pure get in your soul rocker's, than Aerosmith, I've never heard it. They clearly stand up to any Rock Band I have ever heard."
4,night in the ruts,"This lp is Aerosmith's most underrated album, and, in my opinion, their last great studio lp. For me, I look at this lp as the last Aerosmith album. I dont care for the comeback albums"
4,"The ""transition"" album","My title is because Joe did about five songs and Jimmy,his replacement did some work here and ""supa"" did fine work here as well. Though its not better than say ""rocks"" but if your a fan of 70's aerosmith and don't have this in your collection,then do yourself the biggest favour and buy this.I had this when it 1st came out on vinyl and it still holds up. Some songs I enjoy more than others like ""Cheese Cake"" and ""Chiquita"" and the covers on here are solid as hell. Check out the yardbirds cover of ""Think about it."" and the old blues jam,""Reefer head woman.""The only thing that sucks is the cover. but man the music is good.Thats all I going to say about this record...enjoy:)"
5,Participated in her Lecture - Can't wait to read her book !,"Although a 'review' might not be the proper description, I felt it was important to recommend the book having listened to her presentation on this subject. If the book can make the connection with the reader like the author connects to her live audience, there is a message that shouldn't be missed."
5,Great Upbeat Music,"The music is incredible. You will want to listen to it with a good sound system. The music sounds best when you are able to have some bass to it. You get lost in the songs, sometimes feeling like you are out in the desert riding a horse. Sometimes in some sort of ""dream"".It's hard to describe, but the music and the cover have the same ""feel""."
5,Fantastic,"I bought this for my wife and she has played it every day since it arrived. It has become her favorite cd. If you enjoy piano music, this one will blow you away."
1,NOT a Practical guide..,"If you want something to read and apply on your next working day then find something else. This is really so good to get a background and the hype of the area. If you have got long breaks, interested to know the field by reading on holidays then this will make it.Conclusion: The last word in the title is misleading ""Practice"", I did not find any."
2,not too good to be bought...,really i dony know why a ringtone must be on a cd...i am pissed of this ding ding ding from this stupid ''annoying'' frog...
3,dissapointed,"it seems that this web cam does not work with windows vista ,when installed it wipe out computer sound driver had a heck of a time trying to install drivers computer ok now with com stxcam"
5,Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks,"Fantastic price, fantastic results. The best way to watch my grandson grow from 1000 miles away, and hear him too!"
1,Broke!!!!,The videos is all fuzzy now and it doesn't work. After a couple months of use. I'm very disappointed and do not recommend this!
1,Be warned,Logitech web cam works for about a minute and then the video breaks up. Within two minutes the Skype call drops off and one must call again. There is no help from either Skype or Logitech for this problem. Could it be that this product is no longer being manufactured?
1,"Oh, this is bad","What was Logitech thinking? They're a great company in danger of soiling their reputation with such a bad product. The picture quality is horrific. Lucky thing I've got other Logitech stuff to tell me the company isn't all bad. But if this were the first Logitech product I had ever bought, I'd probably never buy another."
1,Cheap Price Equals Bad Quality,"I am extremely disappointed and will return the item. The image is blurry and just all around bad compared to other webcams I've experienced. The audio cuts out constantly and, over half the time, doesn't work at all."
4,very good product,"This camera is very good, it is not too expenseive, the quality is great. I use it for skype (on Vista) and I even use the microphone in the webcam, you can choose the resolution and even at the max one, you can have a very good image. There are some fun effects, (but this is not the main asset!) and it fits well on the top of my laptop.The only bad point is the manual focus, that's for saying that the camera worth its price for sure, I recommand it for all the chats and VoIP!"
3,Circlet scores again!,"Another collection of stories from Circlet Press. This collection focuses on varying types of ""forbidden"" sexual relationships. All of the stories are set in the future. One reason why I didn't rate the collection higher was that six of the tweleve stories in the collection have appeared in other Circlet collections. Still this collection is worth it for the rest of the stories. If you like erotica that is both interesting and hot try any title from Circlet Press."
3,good plastic sheets,product is as to be expected. simply sheets of plastic. dimensions of 10x12 not entirely accurate as it is about 1/2 in short on both L and W. price point is a little high on this product as it is after all just cellophane with different colors.
1,seriously? over a dollar a packet?,"I cannot believe how expensive these are! Even at the local grocery store they are only $.69 per packet, full price. When you add in shipping, you are paying over a dollar a packet. Outrageous!"
1,Urban Legends:666 True Stories that Happened to a Friend or a Friend of a Friend,"I thought this book would be perfect for my nearly 15 year old granddaughter who requested short pieces to read. I thought the stories would be funny and a bit bizarre but the first one she read had to do with a sexual act and she just looked at me with horror. ""Grandma, I don't think I can read this."" Upon going through the rest of the stories, I realized that many of the subjects were of a sexual nature, okay if that's your bag but not appropriate for young adults. Back it went to Amazon and by the time I paid for shipping to and fro, I lost half of my money. Moral, if you aren't familiar with a book, go to a real bookstore and check it out before buying."
3,ondes ondes and more ondes,"This disc programs works from ondes solo, ondes with piano, ondes and percussion all the way up to ondes quartet by French composers Jolivet and Charpentier. I must confess I bought 2 discs on ondes martenot on the whim coupled with a little curiousity. I had first heard the ondes on Messiaen's epic ""Turangalila-Symphony"" and wanted to hear music devoted solely to it, unhampered by the volume of the full orchestra. Jolivet's Trois Poemes is probably the best performance on the disc with Messiaen's wife on piano and sister on the ondes. The ondes has a diversity of sounds it can create. While Jolivet and Charpentier write effectively and lyrically for this chosen medium, the other disc I bought (Estelle Lemire-Ondes) programs works which fully realize the total potential of the ondes. The ondes is not for everybody (probably one of the more esoteric and arcana of electronic instruments of the 20th century) but a good intro for the curious at heart!"
3,"Doesn't Help Shed Control, Comfortable to Use on Short-haired Dogs Perhaps","I much prefer a rake to this brush. My border collie/chow mix's coat is barely touched by the pins of this brush, let alone her undercoat. This same company makes a rake that is very nice to use and way better overall. The handle is comfortable to use on this one and the slicker side does make her appear more shiny, I'd imagine it's wonderful for short haired dogs, just not my fluffy girl."
3,Good but a little hard going for the beginner,"This book makes quite heavy reading. I have been fencing for a while and I found it hard going. I would certainly recommend starting with a more basic book. In the books defence, it is very comprehensive."
3,Different Kind of Blue,"I bought this CD and it's ok... although it's not quite what I had expected, I was leaving for work and heard one of the songs on the satellite and thought that it was awesome... I purchased it without review, certain that I would love the whole CD regardless.... Oops, the rest of the CD was not to very much like that song...."
2,Can birds laugh? ...,"... Because if they can, they were sure laughing at me when I put this thing in my yard. Not only did it fail to scare any birds away, they treated it like a new friend. The owl itself is made of very lightweight plastic, and needs to be filled with something like sand to weigh it down if you aren't planning to mount it or hang it somewhere. It looks fairly realistic considering it's made with cheap plastic.I'll give it one extra star because it makes a pretty cool garden decoration. As for being a deterrent for pests, forget it."
3,Whatever,The thing hasn't scared anything away but it does look cute in our garden and gets a few comments from our friends.
5,Dalen OW6 Gardeneer Molded Owl,"It is exactly what I wanted, received very quickly and since it was an out of season purchase I was glad I could get it online. Very happy with purchase."
3,Keeps some away,Not all pigions are afraid of this guy. I've caught them landing on my railing right next to him twice now.
3,did not work for me,"Based on the reviews I really was hopeful. The owls, I bought 2, did not work for me that well. Our neighbor feeds the birds 2 to 3 times daily and has a huge bird feeder as well. I don't think the birds have the natural instinct to fear the owls as they have been practically hand fed for years. In normal natural circumstances I believe this would have worked, I will have to try something else."
3,Realistic but not effective for ducks,"I purchased this owl hoping that it would scare off the ducks in our pool. We hung it from a pole and it moves easily in the wind and is realistic looking. Doesn't scare ducks or birds, however. Am keeping it to put in the garden hoping maybe it will scare some birds away. Hope springs eternal, right?"
2,Waste of money,Seems like the squirrels are not afraid of these owls. I have a neighbor that feeds the squirrels peanuts in shells so the either are burying them in my lawn or leaving the shells all over my lawn after they eat them. I have one in the front and one in the back and the squirrels are not afraid of them. Waste of money!
4,lifelike owl,i bought this item more for garden decoration than as a scare tactic for pests. it is very lifelike and well made for the price. if you are not going to hang it you will need to fill it with sand or stone to keep it steady
2,This Owl don't fly,"I thought maybe this thing would scare away the squirrels that are eating acorns and making a serious mess in the backyard, notsomuch. Rather than go through a lengthy process mounting Owl I just stood him on the porch overlooking the area in question, by mid-day he was face down in the yard and 5 feet away was mister squirrel going about his business as if to mock me. I didn't want to resort to violence but none of these gimmicks ever work, shame on me for trying this.... more shame on you if you don't heed the warning.By the way I gave it 2 stars because my 2 year old grand daughter loves the thing, maybe I'll teach her how to throw it at squirrels."
2,"Fast ""bro"" to scads of pigeons","Apparently, my Dalen OW6 Gardeneer 16-Inch Molded Owl has become a fast friend to all of the pigeons that have been pooping on my car and porch, and eating my plants. Even though he is moved every day, the offending winged rodents instantly perch in any manner of cozy proximity, including 6 inches away from this purportedly terrifying facsimile. Unfortunately, I would have to levy this pigeon countermeasure an unmitigated failure."
1,we must grow smart birds here TOO...,"I bought this owl, and placed it outside. But, despite moving it almost every day, the pigeons here in Phoenix LAUGHED at it!They will swoop right by it, and even pooped right next to it one time.(they also laugh at the big orange inflated ball with the reflective eyes...sigh)."
4,Great Bird Deterrent,This owl has done the trick....the birds are no longer flying into our entry way and trying to nest. The owl is scaring them off.
5,HOME OWNER BRECKENRIDGE COLORADO,THIS OWL SEEMS TO BE KEEPING THE WOODPECKERS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE. PIROR THEY WERE MAKING A REAL MESS OF THINGS. GOOD QUALITY LOOKS REAL EYES LOOK GREAT. GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY. TIM
2,"Not a bad decoration, but it does not work as intended","Bought it to scare little birds under my deck. Guess what, they would sit on it. Yes, and I moved it around. Not a big expense, but the birds here are too smart for it. Guess they do not have bird brains"
5,Bird Free,"This owl actually worked better than the more expensive solar powered one made by Dalen...at half the price. My lawn is bird free, I can now seed my lawn without worrying about birds eating up the seeds. I have no idea why some reviewers couldn't scare the birds away. This owl keeps sparrows, crows, blackbirds, pigeons and gophers clear out of my yard."
5,It's magic,"Hung it in the back yard and the birds and rabbits have simply disappeared. We have had it for just over a week, so perhaps they'll catch on but so far the pests are gone.We hung the owl using a long loop of thin wire. This results in the owl moving very slightly in the breeze and it's being perched on thin air. We know this is not owl-like or physically possible but the pests don't and maybe it's exactly the movement that makes it particularly effective. In addition, I have installed 4 small ceiling hooks around the yard and have moved it every two or three days and plan to continue doing so.The rabbits being gone is a bonus. We got this to shoo the birds away from our table and barbeque. We also got the inflatable snake for the rabbits (and, if needed, for the birds). But the owl has taken care of both. The snake is still flat, in the box, in the garage."
3,Dalen Molded Owl,Filled it with small rocks to ensure it was heavy enough to sit on my dock and not blow over. Seems to work just fine.
5,GREAT SUNGLASSES!,I purchased these for my little guy when he was about 7 months old- He wore them with no fuss and still wears them when we go out in the stroller and are walking into the sun. He actually likes them (as well as looks adorable in them!) They are very sturdy and worth every penny. I bought the red to go with my Phil and Ted stroller but will definetely purchase the blue too!
3,add it to it,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights. I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's. It became just another DVD to the collection."
1,Inaccurate,"This item is extremely inaccurate and can't be adjusted. First of all I had to call support to find out how to adjust the temperature. The clear lid is not the easiest to remove. Then the thing won't adjust as the coil does not allow for temp to be adjusted despite what support told me. The ""thermometer"" shows 15F to 30F more than it actually is. The support told me in the beginning they will send me a new one, then they changed their mind and told me they need a receipt by mail or fax. Picture owning one is not enough. Picture with proof of inaccuracy also not enough. Who keeps (or can dig and find) an old receipt? The support refused to send me one without the proof of purchase. This is the first company who refused to send replacement. As I own several Acurite products, they are now all going into the recycle bin. I'm gonna buy only German or Japanese products from now on. Had enough supporting unreasonable companies and products and Made In China crap."
1,Acu-rite? Riigggghhht. Not.,"This is the worst thermometer I've ever owned. Our last one was inexpensive but reasonably accurate; we had to replace it when it began to fill with water during rains. This one seemed good since it had a nice large dial since we hang our thermometers outside, viewable from several windows on two floors. But from day 1 it has never been accurate. Into the garbage it goes."
4,Little workhorse,"Just perfect for melting chocolate for dipping treats and fruit. No fuss clean up, relatively quick heating and easy to store. I gave two of them to my candy making friends and they enjoy the little dipper as much as I do."
2,Poorly made product,"I bought this to use for my kitchen to put cider and spices in it to simmer for the holidays to make it smell ""homey"" and ""delicious"". Pot hardly gets warm and no scent permeates the room whatsoever. The product is so small and I cannot imagine it being used for anything else. Poor choice on my part obviously"
3,really too small,I should have taken a closer look at the size.Bought it because my existing crockpot was big and not practical for a family of two.This unit is useless except for sauces and gravies.In fact havn't used it yet.
3,Its okay,"Very small. It does a great job but is extreamly small. Just the size to warm up a small amount of dip.Works great, just small."
1,"This ""little dipper"" is a real crock!","The directions but not the box say this is not for cooking, but merely for keeping dips warm. On top of that, the cord is so short that use of an extension cord is virtually mandatory. It does not keep the food warm enough to meet the 140 degree minimum for warm foods to be safe. And the clinchers--you really have to warm the food first, and then put it in, and when you're done, the thing is an almighty pain to clean. Save your money. BTW, a discussion with Rival reveals that they believe in keeping all cords under 2 feet, so expect to have difficulties on all their products unless you have a very close outlet, and don't plan on taking it to a gathering without bringing an extension cord."
1,Boils everything,You have to watch this crockpot as it will boil liquid out of anything in it. Even on low it does this. Avoid this product.
2,broke on first use,"When I went to wash this after serving a dip, I noticed a chip in the side that wasn't there to begin with. I can't imagine how it got there as no metal utensils were used. I suspect it must have had a defect."
1,Keeps falling apart,"Bought this hoping that it would hold up to making small cookies for the kids. The size is great, but it keeps falling apart the part at the bottom so end up having to use a spoon."
5,Great Product,"Same story as the baking racks, this was a gift for my adult daughter is is training to be a professional chief and she loves them and she's very picky."
4,Good but a little fragile!,"My wife likes to bake, and she read in a magazine about cookie dough scoops. So we looked around and picked up the Oxo based on price and good reviews.The scoop is great, but a little fragile. You see, this is actually our second scoop, the first one we had worked fine until it broke while trying to scoop some cold chocolate cookie dough.We are now a little more careful."
1,Not this time OXO,"I love OXO for my kitchen and always look to them first for any gaget need- this scoop however does not cut it. Much like a few others have said, it failed quickly- with me it happened on the 3rd batch of chocolate chip cookies when the spring popped out, and the gears slipped. Back it goes."
4,Here's the scoop,"You can scoop all kinds of things - cookie dough, pancake batter, ice cream. The possibilities are limitless. OK, well they're actually NOT limitless, but as long as something can be scooped, this scoop will do a great job scooping it.These OXO people keep coming up with good ideas. I never thought to add a comfy handle to my other scoops, but I always reach into the kitchen drawer and root around for this particular scoop because it's a great medium all-purpose size and is really comfortable to hold on to."
5,Loved the scoop,"Oxo 1055893 Good Grips Medium Cookie ScoopJust used the oxo good grips med, size cookie scoop from amazon, First of all Amazon had the best price, & fast delivery.I wanted my cookies to look more professional, making them all the same size. This scoop is easy to use, comfortable, and produced great results. Wish I had bought it sooner."
1,Why are Praeger's e-books so expensive?,I'd love to be able to review this book but at a cost of over $80 for the ebook it doesn't look like that will be possible. Someone please explain to me how Praeger can justify these exorbitant prices for eBooks? This must be a text book that students are required to purchase under bundling deals mandated by the publisher. Everyone else interested in reading the book is sol.
5,Best glue for wood to Azek,"I have tried many wood glues for bonding wood to Azek (composite - previously known as Pro-Cell)- Dap is the only product I found that holds strong and doesn't separate. While there may be others out there, this works very well. And, also note, the shipping was timely and the product was received as promised - overall good experience."
4,Slavic Sorcery:Shamanic Journey of Initiation,This was the first book I have seen about Slavic shamanism. I was surprised to discover how much of the pagan culture had hidden under the guise of christianity. It also went on to disuss some of the practises of the modern day shamans in Russia. Definately well worth the read.
2,Not as advertised,"Well, the item was received but without the pour lid and without a scoop as advertised. I emailed the company on 11/19/06 and received a ""read receipt"" but no response. I called the company on 12/1/06 and spoke to ""Brad"" who said he will research at least getting me a scoop for the 2 containers...haven't heard a thing since. I didn't want to send it back because then I would have to pay S&H. This company doesn't seem to give a hoot."
3,Ultra-Mediocre Celtic New Age Pop,"This is a kind of Celtic elevator music. Stylistically, it contains watered-down hints of Enya and Loreena McKennitt, with an occasional nervous nod to Jean Michel Jarre. The sound is very ""New Age"", musically shallow, and suffers from too much studio post-processing.Although it's nice to hear lyrics in Cymraeg, the album probably isn't worth listening to more than once."
3,Windows Command Line (from a Linux User Perspective),"I found the book to be helpful in understanding some of Window's more common command line programs and associated options. However, the book has omitted significant detail regarding relatively common commands (e.g. robocopy, xcopy, etc.) I recommend the book ""universal command line"", a compendium of command line programs and arguments for six operating systems including windows, linux, unix, mac, solaris, etc. The book has good coverage of windows networking functions."
5,I read this book from front to back the first day I had it.,I have been looking for a book that describes what can be done from the Windows command-line for years and years. I can't even find good (all-encompasing) references on Microsoft's Web sites. This gave me everything I wanted and more. When I came in to work the next day I immediatly ordered copies for everyone on my team (we're software testers).Back before Windows I used to use the command-line to do magical things with batch files but over the years I lost touch with what was possible. This book showed me that you can still do wonderful things with batch files (and more) and told me what those things were. I felt like a kid in a candy store and wasn't able to put it down. I read it from front to back in the first evening. I don't plan to ever let it out of my sight.
5,Great book well written,The instructions are easy to follow. I made the cover quilt and really love the look of it.
4,Textbook Review: Ethics: Theory and Practice,This was purchased as a new book and Research Navigator is suppose to be FREE when packaged with Prentice Hall textbook. I didn't receive a code to use this resource. I called Prenhall and they said I would have to purchase this resource since I didnt receive it with the book. Not sure who was at fault.I am living without it but it could have been a useful tool for my projects.
3,A little disappointed,"The toy looks really good. In the store you can press on the toys hand for a demo. This kind of gives you the impression that when you get the toy out of the packaging and press its foot for the actual dance sequence it will be longer than the demo sequence. NOT!!! The songs and dances are just as short as the demo. This takes a bit of the fun out of it for my 2-year old daughter. If you are used to toys like the hokey-pokey elmo that actually have a substantial performance that your child can participate in without having to stop and press the toy every ten seconds, this is not the toy to buy! The toy is cute and it seems sturdy. If your child is a BoohBah fan they might enjoy this toy like a stuffed animal that they can drag around. The electronic component is dissapointing."
5,cinemocean,"This CD is full of enpowering songs that fill your senses with peace and serenity. I love the theme songs that are compiled together here from movies that I love also. When I listen to this CD it helps me to think clearly, calms my nerves, brings peace to my soul, and helps me to relax. If you want to feel peace and love songs that take you away to another place, buy this CD."
5,Get rid of your old measuring cups!,I really don't know why they even sell those old style measuring cups anymore. It is just so much easier to pour in your ingredient while just looking down. No more bending down to look at the side or having to pick it up and hoping your aren't tilting it! Someone should have thought of these a long time ago!
4,Gift for wife,"She was very happy with these, and uses them all the time.eight more words required,eight more words required -"
2,Is Your Fire Alarm Working?,"I did a really crazy - stupid - silly - thing...I poured a cup of milk, and as I was making a bechamel, I tried to warm it up just a little.30 sec in the Microwave ...Silly me!The stack of white, dense, smelly, smoke going out of the microwave made:1) my wife freak out,2) a fire in the microwave3) me pissed off: there is no marking stating ""do not microwave""the good news is that, I now know that the fire alarm is working.So, dear F@(*%$! OXO,Would that be too much to ask you to print/engrave on the cup ""DO NOT MICROWAVE"", huh?I know.. silly me ... using a microwave with what looked like a plastic made measuring cup.Anyway...I'll be calling you on Monday.."
4,high quality... but,"These are very nice measuring cups but they are extremely hard to read from above (especially the 4 cup capacity one) recently i needed to measure 2 1/4 cups in the largest cup, and i found that i needed to check and re-check the level about 4 times before i was sure of the amount. Plus they don't fit snugly together and take up a good amount of space... on the plus side they are accurate if you have the time and they do extremely well in the dishwasher. I don't think that i would purchase these again, but I don't regret it."
2,Not As Cool,"These measuring cups definitely look cooler than they are. My husband was excited about the angled measuring lines. We put them on our registry for our wedding and were excited to receive them. However, I found it harder to measure accurately with these compared to a regular measuring cup. After a few uses, I noticed that they were sticky on the inside and starting to look yellow. No matter how much we tried cleaning them after use, they did not complete come clean. Any time vegetable or olive oil was put into them, residue was left behind that could not be washed out. It was not long before I was searching for a classic glass measuring cup. My Pyrex glass measuring cup actually comes clean when we wash it!"
5,WOW,"WISH I HAD ORDERED THESE MONTHS AGO. THEY ARE JUST GREAT! THEY ARE LIGHT-WEIGHT, EASY TO SEE THE LIQUID MEASUREMENTS. THEY STACK PRETTY GOOD. CAN'T BRAG ENOUGH FOR THESE CUPS."
2,Peanut Butter for the soul,"I liked this harmless collection of misguided children's ramblings, but I think we heard far too much from Crunchy. I would have liked to have heard some more from Smooth, and I noticed, with alarm, that in this edition there were no submissions from Smooth with Chocolate Whirls."
5,Revival Fire!,"I cannot even begin to describe what God is doing through this man. If you buy only one book this year, this is the one to buy. Brother Steve pours his heart out to us in this book. I have known no other man who can write with such passion. Just read this book. It will give you every reason you will ever need to get right with God"
2,Be Discernful,I found it to be an interesting and easy read. But... my spirit didn't feel right about all of it. I can also see this turning off some potential Christians. I wouldn't personally give my copy to someone I was trying to turn on to the Gospel of Jesus. IMHO
2,Rating,"Although the results are satisfactory, it is very difficult to turn and produce grated cheese. The handle has come off and we very seldom use it now."
3,"works great, but.......","it didn't last us very long. If you are grating hard cheeses, the plastic construction of the handle makes it very unlikely that it will hold up for a long time. It really should be stronger. Our handle broke off in the middle of grating some parmesan. Other than that I loved how you could seal the cheese inside the grater after you were done using it."
1,craptastic,"Craptastic waste of money. Grater is not connected to handle enough and slipps on hard cheese (parm). It's been thrown out and replaced with an all stainless model. I gave it one star, only because the system wouldn't let me go negative.Live and learn."
1,bronken already,"could be just mine, but this cracked from the spatula edge down to the handle afer 1 use. we don't have a dishwasher. After hand washing and leaving to dry in the rack, the next morning it was cracked about 1mm wide. The crack it perfect for bacteria growth we can't reach with a sponge. On it's way to the trash can now. My guess, poor quality of wood."
2,Too hard,"I don't know... this was missing some of everything. First off, this was too big, too hard and once the acrylic cracks an utter waste of money.I gave it 2 stars because I tried it, you definitely know it's there and it had 1 positive... the vibe was strong but the batteries that came with this product sucked. I mean they didn't last even 10 minutes. Maybe I should reconsider the 2 stars...The head of this contraption is for pain seekers. IT'S F-ing huge. And no amount of prep and lube is going to diminish that. Once it's in, you're pretty much guaranteed that its not going anywhere. Try trying to extract it after you have bust one. It's like its giving birth... anally!! It leaves you with one thought: What the hell was I thinking?!"
2,"lightning p-38, Roaring glory warbirds vol 6",Very short on real information of war bird employment in the war. Some pretty good but not outstanding modern inflight.
3,Its got Clonus - that's about it,"I Really enjoy MST3K but can't Rhino release better shows for over $35.00+ bucks?! I mean, there is usually just the one really good one like on this set Parts - the Clonus Horror - nothing much else. The same with volume 11, all that was really there was Tormented. Why can't we see Screaming Skull, Devil Doll and Zombie Nightmare? And probably now we will never see Godzila Vs. the Sea Monster, since Rhino is going to the trouble of Re-releasing Volume 10 with a different show in place of Godzila Vs. Megalon. Which I don't think is fair to those of us who already bought volume 10 - we'll have to buy the same volume all over again just for that one extra show."
3,A decent tech writing intro and reference...,"I found this to be a helpful, and quick, read...but was amused to find grammatical errors in the book. How tacky."
2,"Good, but not necessarily for long term use","This book is general in its coverage and doesn't attempt to teach writing. It does teach some mechanics and offer some adivce on how to structure reports and articles.I found that I read this book once but now don't find it a useful reference. It does contain a number of style guidelines e.g., ""representing numbers and math,"" but many examples are from chemistry and hard sciences; which I found less relevant to me. One chapter discusses what the authors call systems: computers and software.Strunk and White's ""The Elements of Style"" provided, in a small space, rules that you might recall for a lifetime. This book is more like a grammar guidebook with a focus on technical material mixed in.For more examples, you'll need a bigger book on technical writing; and if you want a style guide, you might do well to remember that the basic conventions of English apply to technical writing too. Bly is great writer; unfortunately this is not one of his best books."
1,Not accurate,"In boiling water, read about 195-200 deg. instead of 212. How hard is it to make a thermometer that actually measures temperature accurately?Asad"
1,Inaccurate,I bought this thermometer and found it to be completely inaccurate. Meat was always hideously overcooked. It showed water boiling at 70C which is 30C too low. I would not recommend this product.
2,Product not what it claims to be.,The flag pole and flag both seem to be good quality... But the flag is not actually 3'x5' like it claims to be... It's actually about 2.5x3.5'.
2,Its okay,"It leans forward too much from what my sister has told me.....I purchased it for my nephew. When she used it for the first time, she mentioned two issues. 1. It leans forward too much so the baby is uncomfortable and 2. It doesn't store well."
2,replacement parts,"I bought a seat like this one 2 years ago. My grandson broke the 2 clips off the tray, and they don't sell replacement clips or trays. Summer Infant offered to sell me a new seat, decided not to get another one, for obvious reasons. FYI"
5,Convenient!,"I do not have a child but I babysit a 9 month old little girl alot! This portable high chair has made my life wonderful! It is so easy to use, folds down into a small box and is just perfect for travel or leaving with the babysitter! It is well worth the 20$ spent!"
5,Summer infant Deluxe Comfor Booster- Tan,I'm starting a family daycare and theres are great for my little ones priced was excellent. Thank you and when I exapand I will be ordering more.
4,Good chair it's a little small,Bought this for our grandson. It works perfect a little smaller than I thought. But it doesn't take up any floor space and folds up for storage.
1,Daughter hates it,"This seat is horrible, the ""cushion"" is incredibly thin so the hard plastic can be felt easily through it, the tray is useless if you have a chubby baby, because it squeezes their tummy. Every time I try to put my daughter in this thing she gets very upset, the back sits up so straight that when she's in the chair her body is forced forward, I can't find any way to adjust this, even the backs of my own kitchen chairs don't sit this far forward, it's ridiculous. I'll be tossing this p.o.s. in the dumpster today and buying something better. I do not recommend this seat."
1,Cheap!,This is a crappy junk chair!!!Made cheap and is too low to fit onto the chair...so if you are thinking of taking the tray off and putting it up to your table....Don't bother with this one..You get what you pay for and the reason this is cheap is because it's a cheap seat!!
4,just what we needed,I bought this for an one year old's birthday. It worked out great for her. We normally left it on the floor with the tray locked in place but not tight so she could get in and out as she wanted. It was great for her to eat all her meals in and we could easily move it from one location to another. The washable back was a teddy bear not the giraffe like in the photo but it looked great and cleaned up easily. The chair also looks just fine without the washable back in it. I am very happy with this purchase and it was three years ago.
3,Grandma,Love the seat but the tray is hard to put on and take off. But it serves the purpose for my grandbaby!
5,Love it,"I've had a pair of these tongs for a year or so, and I'm very pleased with it. It does what it's supposed to (it grips food well and is easy to operate one-handed) and has an easy locking mechanism to save a little space in our overcrowded utensil drawer."
5,Great kitchen tool,"I had three pairs of not-entirely-satisfactory tongs in my kitchen that I wanted to replace. These OXO tongs are top-rated by America's Test Kitchen, and the review there pointed out that they have a gentle scallop that won't tear delicate foods.These are great! They come with either metal or nylon heads - I opted for the nylon so as not to scratch non-stick surfaces (I may get a metal pair later since one reviewer mentioned they can melt with high heat). The ring at the top pulls up to lock them closed, so they store easily in a drawer. They are dishwasher safe, so clean up is a snap. They are very comfortable in the hand and the rubber inserts in the handle make for a good grip. The tongs handle a heavy steak easily, and the slightly cupped heads provide a sure grip on food. They also have the dexterity to pick up lighter items such as garlic toast.A great item at a reasonable price!"
2,They broke after first use yet oxo hooked me up with new ones,"I bought these because of their high amazon ratting. My tongs broke...The spring device used to open and close them is now jutting out off the handle and pokes you, and now they are unuseable..I contacted oxo and they sent me knew ones with ease."
4,Just as advertised,Strong and reliable. I have always had a good experience with OXO products. More expensive then I wanted to pay but I wanted something that was going to last a couple years. So far so good four stars because of the price point being high.
5,Sturdy and Useful,"These are good, strong tongs for the ""bigger"" jobs in the kitchen. Easy to grip, clean up well, and the lock feature comes in handy sometimes. I am finding that Oxo makes some great products."
4,"Good durable tongs, but can be hard to clean","This is a very good set of tongs that is reasonably priced. I actually hav ehad this for at least two years and they have never failed to work, even when handling a 4.5 lbs. roast. the mechanism works well and is very easy to ""bump"" the locking mechanism open for use.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because i like things clean and the chanels that make up the tong shafts can be difficult to get clean. They are U shaped and squeezing the spoonge in there doesn't always get things off (especially if they are dried on). Other then that, I love them. they work much better then other look alikes ( which I bought one because I was looking for a silicone one for use on my non stick cookware. OXO now makes one but at the time, they didn't."
5,Oxo Tongs,I was looking for a better set of tongs as the tongs I bought at a grocery store turned out to be very awkward to use. These tongs are better as they stay open when I need them to function and stay locked when I need to store them. The only drawback was that there were no instructions on how to operate the locking mechanism. I had to fiddle with it for several minutes before I was finally able to figure it out. I would suggest that some type of instructions be enclosed to spare others the aggravation.
1,HUH?,"I am astounded by the many glowing reviews. The tong heads melt. Period. Not just from open flames or hot pans, they disintegrate in any ""moderate"" cooking environment. I used them once and returned them. As a fan of Oxo products, I was doubly disappointed, but these are not just shoddy design, they are defective."
5,These are great !!!,"Use at high temps and throw in the dishwasher, like that they lock shut for when I throw in my junk drawer"
4,No Scratchs!,Use this on all my non-stick pans. Though I should of gotten a longer one.Its still a handy tool.I like it and now will buy (since I'm in Amazon already) a longer one too!
3,"Good, but. . .","These tongs work pretty well. I liked the nylon tips for use on nonstick cookware. However, I think the nylon tips are too thick, making it hard to pick up pork chops or anything else using just the tongs in one hand. This is a little disappointing. I think I will try the thinner tipped silicone tongs next. Otherwise I've been very impressed with OXO products."
2,seat dimensions are outside measurements,"Giving this item 2 stars based on the fact, my opinion, these are not Extra-wide. These seats are not as large as you would expect based on the measurements in the description. The measurements given are the maximum outside dimensions. Actual inside dimensions are 17"" wide at the widest point narrowing at the back to 14"" and the seat is only 15"" deep. Also, the armrest is about 4"" off the seat base... useless. Buy these seats if you are a woman size 6 or smaller, not sure what mans waist will fit in this seat."
1,Terrible,"This video is terrible. Horribly boring choreography, a hideous set, and blinding outfits they're wearing. The music is even bad elevator music. Don't waste your money."
1,1 star because I can't givet cero,"too light weight, comes on pair. It didn't hold any book. No cover on bottom. I asked for a return immediately."
2,Floppy Bookends,"Though attractive enough, these large bookends are too flexible to hold up the large books I need them for. Now searching for a better solution."
5,Hard to find,This handle ranks as one of the hardest to find items that I've run into. It has a special taper that hasto be correct to fit right. Never thought Amazon would have this but I was wrong. The handle that brokewas at least 80 years old. This one will outlast me and probably the next user too.
5,well worth the price,"Superbly engineered. I thought a 'fly swatter' was a 'fly swatter' until I pulled this thing out of the box and immediately killed a fly with it, in mid-air on the first swing.The balance, rigidity and leverage makes it MUCH more accurate and powerful than any other fly swatter I've ever used. It really delivers 'one shot, one kill' accuracy.I feel a little silly, making such a big deal out of a relatively insignificant household item but whenever a product works THIS much better than it's competitors', I think it deserves recognition. I highly recommend this product, with enthusiasm. Good hunting!"
2,poor design,"this cable is obviously designed to extend your monitor/keayboard/mouse/mic/stereo feed 30 feet away from your computer. Both of the connections for the mouse and keyboard are male which makes no sence at all. ANYONE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WILL HAVE TO BUY A FEMALE TO FEMALE ADAPTER OR FEMALE KVM KEYBOARD/MOUSE IN ORDER TO USE IT... (I HAVE YET TO FIND ANY ADAPTER AVAILABLE OUT THERE)... Great idea for a cable, but TERRIBLE DESIGN."
1,WOW!!!,"Wow.""Holds up to 500 rolls of tape""!!Only $32.92 for shipping!!I bought 5.Deals like this don't last for long!"
3,Doesn't do what was expected.,"This tool is good quality but was not what I expected. It has a straight knife and the other bar is a row of triangular shaped scratchers that make very fine shavings, not Julienne cuts. My old and now worn out tool has a wavy cutting blade and makes nice square cross section cuttings. I used it primarily on carrots. The outer strips I use raw in salads and the core is then sliced in thin cuts that have a nice pattern on the outside. This OXO tool does not make the square strips nor does it leave a nice core on the carrots. It also plugs quickly in just a few strokes from the tangle of fine cuttings."
1,weak,"This little gadget works for a while, but the blade metal is too fine a gauge to last. Like another reviewer states, it will shortly become a vegetable peeler. I am very disappointed with the quality of this OXO product."
4,Very Good Product,"I bought this and love it. I have used it on carrots and have had no trouble with it at all. The slivers are very uniform, small, and it is very easy to use. My only negative is that sometimes I have to pick up the piece and seperate the Julienne pieces by hand after I make the cut."
5,A Lifesaver for Grandparent Gifts,"I had no idea what to give the grandparents for Christmas last year, then I found out about this book. My 3 year old son and I went through the book, picked his favorite ones and made drawings for all of the grandparents. Two things to know, some of the items are harder than others, especially for a three year old, and you have to help. They can do the prints, but you will need to do the detail work. The book offers many creative ideas for finger and thumb prints. I'm using it again this year on pottery at one of those paint your own places. If you aren't creative, let this book help you. The grandparents were wowed!!"
5,Outstanding! A must see.,"Great movie! One of the best I have seen. Eva Green is outstanding and the entire cast is fantastic. It is like ""Dead poets society"", but with a twisted and tragic end. Eva Green doesn't care much about the students (like Robin Williams) and she is much more selfish and ego-centered. However, we don't understand why until the very end of the movie. We get a hint when she goes out to buy breakfast for one of the girls but we don't realize it until the very end. Great movie, great plot. Deserves 10 stars."
2,"For crying out loud, WHY did I buy this book!?!","I purchased it thinking it was going to be a hilarous novel of lesbian misadventures.Instead I got a boring, non-humorous story, which doesn't even reach a satisfying ending.I got the impression the author was delighted with these characters, but I just couldn't seem to really care what happened to them. Eventually, I had to skim the pages to keep my eyes from totally glazing over on the way to the ending.The plot, such as it is, revolves around two women, Marissa and Alex (I can't count the lesbian novels I've read where at least one woman is always named Alex).There is a strong attraction and affection between the two, but each of them is too afraid to take the next step in the relationship. On page 251 (the book is 270 pages,) after I'd given up all hope of there being a REAL reason for them to be holding back, the author briefly throws in information regarding one of the women's past, which FINALLY explains that character's reluctance."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this album after I heard it, especially since I has very high expectations. I bought it as I first heard it as the theme song for the anime series, Mushi-shi. The first verse of the song Sore Feet Song was used. I wished I had heard the entire song before I bought the album. The second verse was not only disappointing but almost offensive. In order to ease the lost love, the singer talks about how he or she robbed stores and ate rats and toads to feel better. Give me a break. The song, for me, changed entirely. I would avoid this album. Don't buy it. Of course if you think robbing stores is a great thing, then this is right up your alley."
2,hose reels,"The reels are made of good material, and the idea is a good one on paper. BUT, the mounting holes are not coordinated, and new holes must be drilled in order to mount the base on to a brick wall. Fortunately, I have access to a drill press."
4,BIG Popper,"Large capacity popper does stellar job popping corn, with butter-adding a convenient option. Nice product!"
2,"great popcorn maker, cheaply made popper","I eat a good-sized batch of popcorn almost every nite and have done so for at least forty years. I even grown my own popcorn. I used the 6 quart until about a year ago when I got the 8 quart. The base unit is the same for both. The one I bought within a year ago can no longer be used. Somehow the oil gets into the bottom of the unit and begins to smoke, threatening to set it on fire. The unit gets so hot oridinarily that this is a fire hazard. West Bend has somehow cheapened these things compared to the 6 quart one I used for a good 10 years. If I could depend on West Bend to make a good solid unit I would buy another in a flash as it is the best---when made well. For now, it is back to another brand, albeit smaller, necessitating two batches. For anyone buying these newer machines from West Bend, keep an eye on it for safety's sake."
4,One exception ...,"Love popcorn. Any popcorn. Tasted my daughter's made with a 6-Cup West Bend Stir-Crazy and fell in LOVE with the wonderful taste and easy preparation. Don't know if her's does it, but mine will catch a kernal or 3 beneath the middle turn knob and when it pops, it will not come out unless the entire stir arm is unskrewed and lifted to release the popped kernals. This is irksome to have to do after each batch of popcorn.Otherwise, it works great."
1,such a shame,"Too bad. This book starts out fantastic. Props to the author for putting together the best 95-page introduction to C++ I've yet read...but all of a sudden, at page 96, it becomes utterly worthless as the instructions for installing all the included software are fake or wrong or incomplete or something. Whatever happened, I hope it was the publisher's fault and not the author's, because I believed in him 100%. Really, too bad."
2,Ok!!!,I bought these for my mom. When she went to watch them the sound was off on the dvds. So you would see lips moving and then the sound would come.
4,Great show! Great memories........,"I have very little to say about the packaging. If you are careful with the discs, they will not scratch. For the price, this was a steal! What I wish was better is the quality of the video. While it's not horrible, its not much better than VHS. Colors are sometimes muted, off color, and the hues are just not good. I wish a better transfer could have been made but hey, I guess we are lucky we got this at all. Great show!"
2,"Five Star Series, One Star Packaging","I was about to purchase the individual seasons of Soap, one of my favorite television series, when I saw this release scheduled. I mistakenly assumed that it was like the individual seasons, just grouped together. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Talk about a no frills, no bells and whistles set. I imagine that after one complete go round with the disks, they will probably be scratched and in need of replacement (undoubtedly the plan of the manufacturer). As bad as the package is, I would have given a higher rating if I did not feel as if I was missing something while watching the disks. I felt that they were too short in length (22 minutes is the standard for 30 minute shows when in reruns, meaning that each show should be approximately 25 minutes in length). Seeing the reviews of another poster have confirmed my suspicions. I am truly disappointed at being cheated out of my money and memories."
5,Soap was brilliant then and now.,"Soap was hysterical and much too hip for it's time and is still as funny as it was the first time. The cast was brilliant and the writing was equal to the cast. They dealt with subjects that are still touchy and made their point with wonderful humor. The show lost some of it's wit with the loss of Robert Guillaume (Benson), but it still had some great moments. Burt is one of my favorites as was Billy Crystal's character Jody. If you love to laugh, buy this for sure."
4,Complete Idiot's Guide to Horseback Riding.,It was written in an easy to understand style. Information was good and easy to put into practice.
4,Great product,"These are by far the best dish wands I have ever used. The size and shape make it easy to clean most glasses/dishes and as long as you are careful not to slit the sponge when washing knives, each ""head"" will hold up a fairly long time, giving this product a decent amount of bang-for-the-buck. When it does come time to replace the head (or refill the wand with soap), the twist-off top is very easy to handle and stays snug until you open it again. Great product."
4,Buyer beware (But still buy it ;),"This book, like its predecessor, is some of the best science fiction that I've ever had the privelege to read.Unfortunately, the author leaves the reader hanging, waiting for a sequel to tie up all sorts of loose ends (intentionally, no doubt). The author has not, however, published the third book in the series.It's been a 10 year wait so far. Only buy this book if you are willing to subject yourself to the heartache of needing to look for new Anderson every time you walk into a bookstore, but find nothing other than continuation of lesser men's work (Asimov, Lucas, etc)."
5,Excellent quick reference of anyone visiting Paris!,"We used the second edition of this book while walking and driving around Paris during a recent vacation. It fit conveniently in my pocket and was invaluable when navigating the sometimes confusing one way street system. The second edition lacked a metro map, but was complete in every other way!"
4,Pricing Strategy by Morris Engelson,"Business managers will benefit from this excellent text on pricing strategy. It offers simple mathematical guidelines and basic methods for establishing the price for a product or service based on a variety of factors, including peceived value, competitive landscape, and market conditions. Engelson's style is conversational yet instructional, without being overly dry and academic. For anyone in business, this is a strong ""how to"" guide to setting product prices."
3,It's okay,"I purchased this with the hopes that it will help me navigate my aerator pretty easily between my aquarium and my fish bowl (serves as an isolation tank when the fish are sick). I don't know if the problem was with the air pump or this kit but I had to crimp the tubes in order for the air to circulate in all of the ""slots"" .. or else it would just go to one tube and not to everything else."
5,NEW! IncrediFlex Headbands WILL NOT BREAK!,"The headband problem has been resolved! We have a new Incrediflex Headband. The new headband is incredibly flexible, durable and rugged. It also has ""memory"" that allows the headband to be stretched or squeezed to fit the personal comfort requirement of the user. There is nothing like it in the industry.See the video demonstrating the INCREDIFLEX headband being flattened, bent and abused well beyond normal expected use without breaking. The headband can be replaced in literally seconds with no tools whatsoever.[...]"
2,"Decent for rehearsal, terrible for mixing.","These will move around on your head if you are rocking. The plastic hinges are relatively weak, I have one pair that has broken on one side. Otherwise the bass is good for headphone oriented rehearsal and recording, and the isolation makes practice much easier on the ears. However I TAKE SERIOUS ISSUE WITH WHAT THEIR WEBSITE SAYS. They say they are great for critical mixing or some other such garbage. Don't ever mix on these, your mixes will sound like tinny crap. I wasted many hours mixing some songs on these only to have them sound like the bottom was dropped out on any other system. Poor quality drivers and strange resonances of the isolation chamber combine to deliver a poor quality reference environment. Okay for rehearsal, but only slightly better sounding than some Vic Firths."
1,same problem,Bought two spoons and within 2 months both had split along the glue lines. The spoons were hand washed. Get spoons but I can't afford to replace them every two months.
2,Broke after a year,"I'm not sure how long these are expected to last, but mine broke about a year after purchasing. Shattered into several pieces while stirring a soup."
5,"""Asleep the snow came flying . . .""","August may seem like an odd time to review an album named WINTER SOLSTICE IV, but this Windham Hill compilation plays well at any time of the year. Belieing Windham Hill's reputation as a New Age label, most of the pieces on this album are beautifully melodic, elegantly simple, intriguingly complex instrumentals played by master musicians. And Windham Hill makes a point of including such compositions as ""Silent Night,"" ""Dona Nobis Pacem,"" ""Angels We Have Heard On High,"" ""Sheep May Safely Graze,"" and a selection from ""The Four Seasons"" to round out the more modern compositions.You will feel your breath growing easier and your chest loosening if you open yourself up to let this music in. Indulge yourself, friends!"
1,Perry Como DVD,I had the VHS of this show & it was just excellent but moved to a DVD player & ordered this.Sadly it is very poor quality & a big disappointment but better than nothing. The original VHS was great picture & sound. This is very amateur.
2,Buzzing noise makes annoying,"It's a nice little unit and there's no annoying LED light on it to show power is off, which is helpful in some situations, but when the switch is in dim position it emits a low buzzing noise audible if seated within about 3 feet of the switch. Depending on the environment this can be a deal breaker. I got 2 units with the same problem and eventually purchase the Leviton TBI03-1LW that did not have this problem, and though it has an LED it is quite discreet recessed little green light that I can live with (some other models have a quite bright red LED that bulges out a bit and is harder to mask)."
1,Does not dim!,"I plugged this item into multiple lamps and each time, it would go from dark, to a loud pitch humming with a flickering light, to on. The dimmer does not actually work properly."
5,Works great as expected.,"This works great for a lamp in our nursery. Just plug this in the wall, plug the lamp into this and you have yourself a nice dimmer. The switch is smooth and sturdy so it will hold whatever lighting level you select. I'm happy with this product as it performs it's function well."
5,Cool Dimmer,"This plug and play dimmer is just the trick to put a dimmer on a single lamp. In order for the dimmer to be effective, you must use a standard light bulb and not an energy saver."
3,Not Quite what I thought !,Bought this dimmer because it was supposed to be weatherproof ! It arrived and I still needed a dimmer so.... I took a small plastic jar sliced a place where the threads are adjusted my dimmer switch then put a dab of GOOP to cover the slice .... screwed on the top of the jar .... Voila ! I have a weatherproof Dimmer switch !
3,ATV enthusiast,"I bought this gauge thinking it was waterproof . It is not. It works great, looks good too. But after washing my brute, i can see moister behind the lens . Oh well, better luck next time i guess. It's a great gauge if you can keep it dry."
3,OK for diagnostics,"Got it to figure out why the gauge on my dash read zero.. turned out thermostat was open and the truck really was running below where it was readable.Left it installed so I could see ambient temp under the hood, now it randomly stops working."
4,Auch - Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,"Auch drops his debut, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE, a clicky, glitchy album that pulses and throbs. The tracks have a certain iciness to them: ""Black Snow"" has a reggae off-beat but still evinces frigidity; ""Until the Red Fog Rises"" swims in an abstract ambience until the beat finally kicks in. But the warmth also comes in slowly, creeping into ""Pick-Up"" and adding some bright electro flavor to ""Sleeping Dogs."" ""Double Indemnity"" has enough thump to work the dancefloor, and ""Fast Run"" has an aquatic feel to it. ""Frankfurt Connection"" has a denseness that fades into minimalism at the end, while ""The Glass Key"" chugs turgidly as a tugboat and ""Clandestine"" goes subterranean. Cool and mysterious."
3,"A little outdated, and not proofread","This is a good book for the last version of Qt but not great for the current one (as of 8/27/2002). It also has significant proofreading errors in it, implying that it was written in more or less the same amount of time that you're supposed to read it. However, it is an easy-to-read introduction to Qt programming and is nice for beginners (I recall a quote saying ""of course, if you're a professional programmer you wouldn't have gotten this book"" -- and I *am* a professional programmer). The O'Reilly book is a better choice if you already know programming; and if you don't know programming you probably shouldn't be starting with Qt. :)"
1,errors,If you are looking to learn this is not the book becuase you will quickly get frustrated with the errors that the book has. You cannot make mistakes in code! If you are looking for a companion to a primary book to better understand some things and work out the errors in this book then it is not a terrible purchase. I do not mind grammatical errors but when you are coding and learning to code it is a huge problem and dissapointment. It will help you through some things in QT.
1,Thoughtless and mundane music,"Having heard that Will was really good I bought this CD; I traded it in within a week. This CD is repetitive and weak. While there are many talented artists on Windham Hill, Will is not one of them. Get something else, may I recommend Patty Larkin?"
4,Margola,"Iam very interested In Margolas guitarmusic And ver glad to find a new title The 8 bagatelles Unforfortunate i can not find much Music by him or informatien at all, i am very found of his writing for the guitar"
2,not worth it,Bought this because the other contollers I bought from amazon were crap and I can say this was also the worst buy I have ever done.I bought this for my son for the xbox because it was his first game system. This thing barely worked a week.....Dont buy so not worth it
1,Don't buy these controllers,"Purchased 2 controllers, after first use one of the two had broken. Contacted the seller and they allowed us to return it for exchange of a new one. Meanwhile second controller broke, got the replacement back and it broke after the first use.They are just junk. You get what you pay for."
5,"What's Happening,Happens Again","I watched this back in the 70's and loved the series.It ran from August 1976 to April 1979.Dewayne,Rerun, Roger,Dee,Shirley and we can't forget MAMA. The show reflects the 70's in black culture.If you liked the Crosby show,then you will enjoy this series.SIDE NOTE: The series returned in 1985 and ran till 1988 under the title ""What's Happening Now"" with most of the 1970's cast in tow.Watchable,but not as good as the 70's version."
2,Not as good as the stock one,The run time for this battery is shorter than the original. Please note that the Xacti camera is a cheap product. It stopped working after a couple of months. I won't buy a Sanyo product again.
3,Would have worked better with a smaller page size,"While as with most Putnam books, there is a wealth of information here that has never before been published in one book, the larger page format that Putnam adopted for its later books simply does not work well here.Putnam's earlier books on aircraft manufacturers, with their 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, were much better at presenting the data in ""encyclopedic"" books like this one; the larger page size should be reserved for books with a running narrative. At the very least, the three-column-per-page format should be replaced with one or two columns.I hope that, if Anova (the current holder of the imprint) puts the Putnams back in print, that they re-format this book, and similar Putnams with encyclopedic listings of aircraft, in the 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, which would make this book much more pleasant to use!"
3,Don't use the spray...use a cotton ball instead,"I bought this yesterday to provide relief for my cat's hot spot. Whoever designed the idea of using a ""spray bottle"" for cats is an idiot. You may as save yourself the money and use a water gun every time your cat starts to like its hot spot.I've never used a water gun on my cat to correct bad behavior...however this instilled the same type of fear and had my cat cowering in the corner by the 3rd use. Thus the ""genius"" behind the spray idea is an idiot. Cats don't like to be sprayed.HOWEVER, the formula does work when soaked into a cotton ball and applied to the hot spot. I noticed my cat licking the hot spot less and less."
2,misleading,"I was expecting more intelligence behind this book. It is more or less an inside joke for the author. An attempt at humor. Parts of it were funny however there are far greater attempts at humour than there are actual laughs. The book has very little to do with actually ""coping"" when surrounded by idiots. Nothing insightful about the ""stupid person's"" state of mind, or the havoc ""stupidity"" can wreak.Parts of it are written for the ""stupid"" person as a sort of handbook or course, but that's not to be taken seriously at all.The book is a little insulting at times because it sometimes assumes that the reader is ""an idiot"". What I wish Ben would have considered is that people picking up a book on ""idiots"" or ""stupidity"" are most likely not idiots or stupid."
5,A masterpiece !!,"I've got this book translated into portugues and it's marvelous, i'm a philosophy lover and besides that a great fan of the Star Wars series.This book is a big eye opener as it discusses many contemporaries issues, and better than that make us think and ponder, this are some of the goals philosophy intend to wake in us.This is a light and easy to read book, it also contains a lot of metaphysical and spiritual elements, making this work also a spiritual source of inspiration. The souls of the Star Wars are embodied in this book.Highly recommended!!"
4,Worth it,Raises intereating points that will be attractive to any star wars fan. It sometimes gets a little wordy but worth reading.
1,Split after one use.,"I used this spoon one time, to stir a lasagna meat sauce I was making. Washed it. Dried it. Put it on the counter. Came out this morning to find that the spoon part had split, from the tip to about halfway into the spoon.The three cheap wooden spoons I bought for $3.00 (for all three, combined) at the grocery store are still working just fine. While this spoon looks great, I absolutely would never buy it again."
5,Delicious hair growing biotene,GREAT! Now the whole family uses it. It's the adult version on Johnson and J baby shampoo but for hair growing!
2,Biotene Hair Products,"The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner was when I was rinsing out my hair after dying it and I had never seen my hair look so good - lovely, full and curly. I liked the products a few more times, but never had results as the first time. After a couple of weeks, though, I found my hair extremely dry and have discontinued using this line."
4,Like spending an afternoon with the guy,"Part rant, part memoir. A quick and easy read that shouldn't take very long. Zimmer is a happy old guy with great war stories. He hates Steinbrenner but adores Joe Torre. A pleasant was to spend an afternoon or so."
3,Relaxing but fairly unimaginative,"I felt this was standard relaxing type music that was bordering on being boring. I suppose that would put you to sleep faster if that was your goal. I happen to really like the "" pure mood"" series. Much more creative collection. Probably won't use this too much except for background to try to get to sleep (usually not a problem)."
1,not worth it,Bought my wife this charm for a stuffer. Not only does it looks cheap but the pearl came off the pendant and the chain is as thin as my hair.Find another pearl!
5,Quinlan's is my dad's favorite guide to actors...,"my father has two prior Quinlan directories that he has next to his easy chair... so when he started mentioning that he wanted the newest directory, i saw a christmas present moment. the guide has pictures of the actors, movies they've been in, and other notable pieces of information about them...great book."
1,Good company,When I received this product it had an electronic defect and I wasn't thrilled so I contacted amazon and had the company contact me and they told me they couldn't refund money but would send me a new crossover so I went that rout and I'm pleased to say not only did the new one not have defects but it was a bigger better model so I'm very happy
1,Tore apart right away.,"The yellow sponge part tore away from the red scrub pad on second use. Would not recommend. In addition, I purchased this item PRIME (free shipping). Just noticed the replacement heads (what I need now sicne the original flew apart in my sink) are not PRIME items. Methinks some bait and switch going on here."
3,Only if you are absolute begginer,"This book is for those who have not had any contact with Ruby on Rails. If you've read the most common tutorials on the Internet this book should not help you too much. Even if you're a beginner I'd still recommend Bruce Tate's Ruby on Rails Up and Running instead of this one.Having said that, the book is well written and uses a language that should allow even those who are not seasoned programmers to understand how Rails works. Every explanation is done using real code, so it's very practical. The chapters on the ruby language are also good enough if you're a beginner."
2,Useful protection but very flimsy,"I have had my case for all of 6 month. I found it much more protective than the included flip cover as I tend to throw it in my computer bag. I dropped the case, open with my SL-10 in and the clips that lock the clie in snapped off with ease. Unfortunately, it's the best thing out there for the models it fits but not made for durability... Ah, why o' why did my Palm V and it's bullet-proof steel case have to die..."
5,Works well.,Works well. Easy to adjust. Was simple to put together. Instructions well written. Great for home work outs. Only adjustment I would make would be to use a keeper pin to keep roller pads closer to feet if that is what someone wanted. I use a belt to hold them down. Excellent product for the money.
2,stamina bench,"not a good product, bad experience with the purchase, pieces missing, ... will not buy from amazon again because of this."
4,Not bad,"This unit was easy to put together and easy to use. It's not a heavy duty metal tubing item, more like a light weight portable unit.Worth the money at $150. and free shipping."
5,Quality Product,This is good quality heavy duty extension. The powder coating seems to be nice and thick. Time and Florida elements will tell.
4,Sure beats razors!,"It's a wonderful shaver. Took me a long while, 2 months, to get used to it. But as they promised once you did the shave would be good and close.My only complaint - the wear on the heads and screens. They wear out to quickly! I replace mine 2-3 times more frequently than my husband does his. But given legs have more surface area than a face...I'd buy this again! Or maybe the newer titanium model."
4,the Remington I remember,"Remington WDF-7000 Smooth and Silky Womens Foil Shaver with Clean and Charge SystemI have used an electric shaver for many years. The shaver I had which recently stopped working (not a Remington)was not all that great, but it was a gift so I struggled with it -- didn't cut closely and took forever to do the job. Prior to that I used a Remington for many years which worked just fine. Now this newest one seems to be comparable. I am glad to have a close shave once again with it."
5,Nice shaver,Really like the shave of this shaver. Has a long life after charging. Cuts well and is comfortable to hold. Better than others I have bought. Would recommend.
3,Guess I Just Don't Like Electric Shavers,"As electric shavers go, this one is probably fine. It has a nice shape that is easy to hold and maneuver. It stays charged and is easy to clean. But I just don't like the shave. I have to go over and over the same area to get a halfway decent shave but it still has a stubble feel. By the end of the day I can't even tell I shaved. I bought it because my dermatologist wanted me to stop using a razor. I used it for a while but have since gone back to the razor. Now I only use it for convenience if I want to shave without the water mess. I definitely would NOT use for underarms. I tried once and it chewed me up. OUCH!"
2,No sé que pensar,"La primera vez que oí este disco dije ""qué horror"". Jon Anderson haciendo un disco ""latino"" y cantando en castellano y portugues con ese acento británico. Con posteriores escuchas, me doy cuenta que, en realidad, si cantara en correcto castellano, la cosa cambiaría totalmente. Las letras, por otra parte son, en muchos casos traducciones literales del inglés, lo que otorga giros idiomáticos que jamás se utilizan en castellano. A pesar de eso tiene un sabor peculiar y algunos temas salvables. No deja de ser una rereza y una boutade de Mr. Anderson, pero, bueno, se puede escuchar."
3,Calories Galore!,There are multiple servings per bag. One bag is well over 500 calories. I do not recommend these if you can't eat just a few nuts and save the rest for later. The nuts themselves taste great.
4,Solid Piano-Voice Interplay,"Tord's playing is, as always, powerful, restrained, lyrical, contemplative. Siri's clear voice weaves beautifully in and around Tord's playing. As has been pointed out elsewhere, this is very different from Tord's more well-known ECM material (""Being There,"" ""Changing Places,"" ""The Ground,"" ""Restored, Returned""), and in fact it was from liking those works and wanting more Tord that I discovered ""Aire & Angels"" and ""Aire & Angels II."" It is nice to catch another side of Gustavsen away from his Trio and Ensemble recordings, and to meet a wonderful jazz vocalist talent like Siri."
2,"What I need, but expensive!!!!","Love the scanner, hate paying for these kits/rollers. The rollers for this scanner probably cost Fujitsu .25 to make but it ends up you paying $80 for them. I guess it's a similar deal that printer companies do with their ink cartridges. The kit is what I needed, I just wish the price was a little more reasonable."
1,cmt router doesn't come close to professional grade,"After 3 hours of assembling, which was a nightmare, the table was finally complete. There was an array of extra and missing parts. The fence took two people to move. The alignment of fence to router was juvenile.After being a master carpenter for 25 years, I would not recommend this table to anyone."
4,Solution to the Battery Life Problem!!!,"I have had this PDA since x-mas 2002. I was a long time palm-handspring user. The Operating system is not as ""bug-free"" as the Palm OS, however it is more robust. You are getting a buggier OS that has more functionability. It is after all, Microsoft who produces the OS and just like their PC operating system...There are a few bugs. Now as far as BATTERY LIFE, I did lose my data early on. But there are two fixes for this proble. 1)When you are ready to power down the unit, goto ""settings"", click ""system"", click ""memory"", click ""running programs"", click ""stop all"". This will stop the programs and increase the battery life. 2)Buy a memory card and perform frequent backups (just like on a PC). If you do by chance lose complete power, you can perform a restore and be back in business. Overall a nice PDA with all the rebates. I got mine ... in December, but I think you can pick one up a bit cheaper now."
1,Traveling with a Useless PDA,"Extremely poorly engineered product from Toshiba. I have experienced data loss problems multiple times after the battery runs low in 24 hours. The data is stored in RAM and no backup power supply is designed into the product. No warning is given as the PDA just refuses to start up. Even when the unit is turned off, the power is drained in 24 hours. This is a different issue from the e740 recall which loses data when changing the battery.PDA's are used by traveling business professionals!.Do NOT purchase the e335. I should have reviewed all the discussion boards which clearly express the problem with Toshiba PDA's.I have owned many Toshiba products, but this has turned me away from Toshiba forever.BTW the support people where quick to answer my questions and concerns, unfortunately their hands are tied to resolve the problem."
2,Traveling with a this PDA,"Poorly engineered product from Toshiba. I have experienced data loss problems multiple times after the battery runs down in only 24 to 30 hours. The data is stored in RAM and no backup power supply is designed into the product. Most PDA's are used by traveling business professionals. BTW the support people where quick to answer my questions and concerns, unfortunately their hands tied to resolve the problem. If you do not travel and can plugin everyday, this PDA is a good value."
2,disappointed,"I had read many good reviews of this product. However, I have had many bad experiences with it. In just 1 week I have had it run out of power twice, losing all preferences and requiring resyncing. If I was travelling, that would not be an option. I have had the machine lock up, it would not turn on, and required another hard reset. I'm going to return this as soon as possible."
3,"Good only for XP, but not other systems","This product works very good in XP, but not in other systems like OS X and FreeBSD.OS X(10.4.6):- The system cannot detect the device.FreeBSD(4.11):- The system can detect the device, however it gives error occasionally."
1,NON Existant Customer Support AVOID this item,"Tried calling Mad Dog customer support as unit didn't work, number referred you to a new number which referred you to some poor guys home AVOID this item it doesn't work, NON Existant customer support, there web site also does not exist, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
5,Fresh sound from Winston,"This CD has become my favorite in our George Winston collection. I have been listening to ""George"" for about 15 years. Clearly I enjoy his style in general, but this one is special. His interpretation of these songs has more of a mystical sense -- as if he's playing for the woodland spirits while they dance and twirl."
5,The only doll my child will play with...,"We have tried every doll on the market and we finally decided to take a shot on this one and it has paid off tremedously. The doll is about 15"" tall and comes with very durable clothing. We have also purchased a few other clothing sets and my daughter just loves dressing and undressing Dora. Her hair can easily be brushed. I would recommend getting the Dora clothing set that contains her pajamas. Showing my daughter how Dora gets ready for bed has been a great eduational tool for her."
5,"Vintage Bennett with his best accompaniment, a jazz combo.","I found this recording on an LP at a college library (and returned it.) Tony is at his best with Rodgers and Hart lyrics and without violins. The jazz accompaniment is first rate. Every tune is superb and perfectly phrased. About twenty years ago (1979) my 12 year old daughter was in the kitchen with me while I was preparing dinner. She said:""Dad, that Tony Bennett has a terrific vocabulary."" I told her Lorenz Hart had something to do with that. We were both correct."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS DETENTION THE HORROR MOVIE,"the detention movie im talking about is the one with DAVID CARRADINE:I just watched the movie. From the word go, i realized its going to be scary as hell. Better then anything else out there. THIS IS REALLY SCARY FILM that is based on true facts. Great story, good looking actors, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Loved DC in the movie. (creapy to realize that he died right after doing this movie). I give it a 10+. I highly recommand you see it. this is going to be a cult film. To see it is to be part of those that recoginzed a great horror movie first. You Will enjoy it."
5,Did you ever think you'd empathize with the vampire?,"Beautiful movie! The best vampire movie ever to my mind. Set in spectacular landscapes, with really well selected music and a plot, that even if it recapitulates the original silent movie, provides a whole depth into the characters and the underlying questions about death and immortality."
5,Werner Herzog's Epic Masterpiece,"Werner Herzog's remake of the 1922 classic is an epic masterpiece in movie making. Beautifully filmed with glorious music, knock-out performance by Klaus Kinski as the flambouyant Count Dracula. Only one other film in history has impressed me this much with unforgettable scenes of the true nature and feeling of vampires. This isn't an ordinary vampire movie, it doesn't have any scares, it doesn't have any bloody scenes either, it's not made to scare or gross the audience, it's made to give the audience remarkable visions of vampires, so masterfully done that they are impossible to forget. Nosferatu The Vampyre remains poignant to this day and stands as one of the greatest films in history."
4,a great classic,"my 15 year old likes horror films so I got him this to see ""where it all started."" It's been a big hit and he's gotten interested in seeing what other films the director made. Great value too"
5,Best Dracula Film of all,"For an essay project I did earlier this year on vampires, I was required to watch every Dracula film ever made as research. I'm not a film historian or anything, so I can't say it's the ""best,"" but after watching ALL those Dracula films, I can say that it is my absolute favorite of them all.This film is stunning, to say the least. There are no cheap or cheesy ""Hollywood"" tricks - for example: hundreds of LIVE rats are used in this film, as are LIVE bats instead of silly rubber things on strings.I don't really want to say too much that would give away every charm of this film, butKlaus Kinski made an excellent Count (the best Nosferatu, in my opinion), and Isabelle Adjani was the most beautiful Lucy of them all.Very, very excellent remake. I highly recommend it to any Dracula fan - or even a non-Dracula fan.I never really liked the Dracula story, personally... but I love this film."
5,Thorough and Well-Written,"An extraordinary book on an extraordinary place, A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert is well written for both the layperson and expert alike. Each of the diverse chapters is written by the expert(s) on those subjects, who not only know their subjects well, but also write clearly and enthusiastically. Chapters cover the expected topics -- geology, climate, human cultures, plants, and animals -- and the unexpected -- the uniqueness of the desert's air and light and its ""deep"" history. The Sonoran Desert is enthralling, and this book will heighten your awareness of the desert's beauty and complexity and will provide you with information on where to visit and what to expect during each of the Sonoran Desert's five seasons."
1,pay through the nose,"It is true that this is a masterpiece. So is Moby Dick. Would you pay $90 for it? What is Criterion doing? Are they out of their minds? $120 for Ran? Come on. If you can spend $200 for these two great films, no doubt of their greatness, then you are loaded, and love films. It boils down to Hollywood producers and some movie stars."
1,Remington has really slipped...,"Unfortunately, there are not many women's electric razors on the market. I replaced my second Remington with this model, after it died after a year of use. I bought this one just a few months ago, and it has just died. My first lasted several years. I guess I'll be going back to regular razors, because I am not going to pluck down $40 - $50 every few months to replace a razor. This shaver was by far the worst... after several uses, it became very noisy, and did not provide as close a shave as my Smooth & Silky Plus that died after a year of use. Emails to Remington have been ignored. Buyer beware!"
2,Massive razor burn,"I got this for my gal and she suffered massive razor burn under her arms. It didn't hurt her legs, but it took a while to get all the little hairs."
1,"If you like boring, buy this...","This was the most repetitious album....that is, next to ""By Heart"". Very boring! Save your money."
3,"Nice looking, not long lasting",They are beutiful and look very clasic. The problem is the mate finish is very sensitive and scratches easily. Everytime someone cuts on my plates I can hear the scratch been created. Most of the plates the black is replaced by mark and I only been using it for 2 weeks. Very disapointing. The bottom of the plates should have been made with the glossy finish and this would have not occur.
1,dont waste your money,"The caes dosen't fit properly, the face plate never stays on the phone, it always swings off. I wasted almost $30 i wish i could get my money back or just buy the leather caes. Dont buy"
2,Dissappointing compared to other guides,"Heavy reading. Not a fun or easy read. Not very user friendly. No pictures of the sites. Informative, but wouldn't recommend this for those traveling to Paris for the first time."
3,pessimistic and creepy,"I have loved most of Miranda July's work and anticipated another interesting, arty, thoughtful movie. Unfortunately, the dark tone of ""The Future"" made me re-assess her talent. While Miranda July is a great writer, her acting skills are weak, especially compared with the other actors in this movie. I thought the entire premise was creepy and the disconnect between what we were seeing (affairs, low self esteem, drifting apart) and how utterly UN-emotional the characters were compared to the narration, was jarring. I was left with a sad sticky feeling, and I wouldn't recommend this movie."
2,Valium needed,"(SPOILER ALERT)Although I enjoyed a few short (very short) sections of this film, it falls far short of her first film. I found the cat ""voice"" and the simplistic paw animations laughably bad. The ending, with the cat being euthanized because these two self-absorbed people forget to pick it up at the shelter, is a real jaw dropping downer. Um...wait a minute....Actually,it was probably more humane than to send the cat to live with Miranda."
3,Slow and steady...,"It took about an hour before I realized what the big deal was and I almost turned it off a few times, but by the end I was simply amazed! Don't give up... it's a beautiful movie!"
2,Teeters between engaging and annoying. Ends up annoying.,"Teeters a back and forth between engaging and annoying but, despite some marvelous segments, ultimately lands more on the annoying side. Not so much so that I wouldn't give another Miranda July movie a try, though."
3,Boston Jane,"I was a little diappointed -- the story was good, but lacked something. I'm not sure ifI'll read the other books in the series"
3,Boston Jane,"As I understand this book is based on true events. When a young girl,Jane Peck, finds an opportunity to come to colonial America to escape the disapointment of her father and the torture some Sally Biddle,a childhood enemy,and has sucessfullybecome a lady in the process. She faces hardship and joyous discoveries,as she finds herself and her true love. This book is good for those of us who enjoy the romantic adventures of our nations beginning. Its an average book in my own opinion."
2,Boston Jane By: Jennifer Holm,Boston Jane is a book about a girl back in the 1800s. She is 15 and is going to get married to William who lives on the frontier. Jane is going by boat but when she gets there she finds out there are only Indians there and not William.Jane has to stay with the crew of the ship on the frontier. She finds out what life is like for them. Jane has to pitch in and do her share of the work. At first this is hard for Jane because she never did any real work before.Boston Jane isn't a book I would recommend. It was pretty boring until the end. All Jane does is worry about being a proper lady. This doesn't make her life very exciting. This isn't a book you should read.
5,Good book on SSL,"I thought this book gives a very good intro to SSL as well as getting in depth. It's organized in four parts the first being a high level overview. Each part gets more in depth until the fourth part where you actually see some of the bytes being sent across the wire. This is the only book on SSL that I've been able to find. It does not go in depth on the cryptography side, but if you need to know how the protocol works, it's a great reference. I've been working with SSL libraries for over a year and this book offered a great explanation. I've recommended it to coworkers as an intro to the technology and they've come up to speed very quickly."
4,something new and interesting,"This is a great book with ideas about what you can do with pebbles used to make designs in your garden. Many gardening books are very much alike, but this one is different. I very much enjoyed it and hope to make my own pebble mosaic soon."
2,NO ANIME HERE JUST MUTUAL ANIMATION!,"This book doesn't have a even the slightest HINT of anime, this guy has NO CLUE what he is talking about! Some general rules of animation are somewhat useful but ANIME IS UNEXISTANT IN THIS BOOK!! I cannot stess this enough! His animations are a mix of western animation and japanese animation except there are ONLY THE WORST QUALITIES OF EACH!!! If you want a anime/manga book, PLEASE buy one from a japanese profesional animator, but STEER CLEAR OF THIS BOOK!!! THey should pay you just to even consider this thing! It has no right to even bear the WORD anime, much less make the false claim of knowing ANYTHING about the nature of anime. THIS BOOK IS NO GOOD!!! (barf!)"
3,Depends upon what you want.,"As other reviewers have already cited, this is not a OpenGL programming tutorial, but rather a computer graphics tutorial. As a computer graphics tutorial it is perhaps worth a 5 STAR rating. As a OpenGL programming tutorial it is worth a 1 STAR rating. The explanation of computer graphic concepts is very well presented with ample linear algebra oriented math. There are problems at the end of each chapter of which a significant number seem to come out of nowhere. That's just standard academia mentality for an upper lever/graduate level textbook."
2,Could have been much better,"This probably would have been more enjoyable if the main character hadn't been so dim. I don't require my heroes to be universal geniuses but seeing what is right in front of their noses shouldn't be too much to ask.He also fell in love immediately, dithered around doing not much of anything and sort of backed himself into accidentally being the hero.I probably would have forgiven all of this if the expected* humor ever materialized and if more of the characters were fleshed out a little better.*Probably my fault, I don't recall if the summary or blurb ever said it was going to be humorous but I got that impression and then had that expectation."
1,WARNING!!! BEWARE FLAG NOT MADE IN U.S.A.,"The description for this flag lists a bullet point ""100% Made in the USA"". This is a complete and utter lie!!! A small tag located on the flag displays ""Made in China""! Fellow Devildogs and other proud Americans, do not be fooled as I was with this imitation flag or the company that sells it by stating it is made in the U.S.A.! What a complete disgrace! Shame on you Valley Forge!!!"
2,basic flag,"Light flag for inside use or display. Won't last long outdoors in the elements, though for price, I am happy with what I got. Met my purpose. Similar flag at local shop was 18 $..two stars based on quality..."
1,Useless little thing!,"If you nose comes in a straight line, and has right angles in it, and has no curves in it, and you can't actually smell with it, and you don't actually grow hair in it, then this might work for you. A waste of money if they gave it away. Try another company that makes a round one that fits round noses and ends in ""onic""."
3,Good for the price,"For the price, you can't beat it. Although I'm not sure I'll order it again. The coverage is good but my skin doesn't necessarily like it. Small breakouts in the t zone and dryness around my nose are some of the things I've experienced."
4,"Good product, but not light enough.","I like almost everything about this product. It goes on smoothly and feels good on my skin. The sunblock aspect is great. I can't really tell how well this product moisturizes, because I stopped using it after only three or four tries. The problem is that my skin is fairly pale (I've found that Covergirl AquaSmooth in Ivory matches me well). I bought the lightest shade this product has to offer (Ivory to Fair), and it still goes on too dark. I'm not too disappointed; it's almost summer, so I'll probably be able to use this product once I have a bit of a tan. Just a heads-up to all of the lighter-skinned girls out there."
4,Pretty good moistuizer,"I like this product; I have used the Olay Total Effects tinted moisturizer for years and wanted to try something different... The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer is a little more like a foundation, it's not as liquid as the Olay, but it's very light on the skin and doesn't clog up my pores. I give it a 4 star rating."
1,Not compatible with Full Suspension bikes,"This works fine on my road bike but not at all on my mountain bike. Your crank arm needs to pass over your spokes at the point where your rear suspension arm also does in order to align the magnets. Since this isn't spelled out in the description, I can only give it 1 star."
4,"So Far, Awesome","Attaching it to the bike was easy, the directions are clear. The first rotation of pedals and wheel had my Garmin Forerunner 410 detecting it. There was some calibration I had to perform on the Forerunner to get it to read cadence, miles, etc. correctly, but that was more to do with the Forerunner than the GSC 10. I have not had this outside yet, however, I am very happy with it."
4,Works as advertised,"Be aware that many road bikes have the crank hollowed out on the inside to reduce weight. That makes mounting the magnet a but difficult, but not impossible. Consider a different magnet that will self adhere to the steel threads for your pedals for any easy solution."
2,Not Waterproof,"I'm a big fan of Garmin computers, and especially the mapping features of the 705. If there were any other computer that did what theirs does, the GSC-10's sensitivity to water would be an unacceptable design flaw. It's supplied with zip-ties (requiring a cutting tool to remove it), yet it won't tolerate even a small amount of water such as from washing one's bicycle or riding in light rain for over an hour. Garmin is honorable and will replace drowned GSC-10's under warranty. (I'm on my third one.) But it's really unacceptable to have to remove the sensor any time I wash my bike and any time rain is anticipated, and to have to do without it for a couple of weeks, or longer, any time I get rained on unexpectedly. They're replacing so many of these that, after a wet spring in the eastern USA, my last warranty replacement was backordered for five weeks."
2,Dosen't work,I got the cadence sensor.Connected it like it is supposed to be connected.I can't see all the features on my 310XT. For example I can't see RPM.I think it is not working correctly.I'm disappointed.
5,Very impressive for a Forerunner 305 Accessory,"I bought this to add on to my Forerunner 305 and I couldn't be more satisfied. It was a bit confusing to install, since the unit has a speed sensor for a GPS unit, but they don't explain why. I assume this was for indoor use. I will find out, this winter. I have a carbon fiber bike, so I was careful not to tighten it too much, and after about 200 miles with it, I have not made any adjustments. I works very well, and is great to keep track of your average cadence and review on a computer. I would recommend this for any cyclist. I will be buying another one for my indoor bike on the trainer."
5,great--just what I needed,Great--measures my RPM so I know I pedaling smoothly and not slacking! Makes me a better rider. Its just another add on to my Garmin 705 that increases accuracy in readings. I also use the heart rate monitor too.
3,Works but spoke magnet design could be better,"I ride fairly casually in the winter and 200 miles a week during the summer, not a lot but a decent amount. Luckily I've seen these on other bikes because the instructions weren't super helpful. When everything works, it works great. The magnet-spoke design is my biggest complaint. I have low-profile / slim spoke and it made it very tough to crank down on the device to fit my spokes. I'm sure I'll end up replacing a few this season like others have mentioned. Would like a much better design."
4,great with foreruner,The sensor is a great addition to the Forerunner 305. I was able to switch out my catseye computer and use this instead. It was a piece of cake to install and paired with my Forerunner right away. I like that it has cadence and a wheel sensor as I will use the bike in the basement during bad weather on my fluid trainer and it will still give me distance. I would suggest it to anyone that is going to bike and run with the Forerunner.
3,Spoke magnet not the best,"The spoke magnet that comes with the GSC10 is pretty terrible, as there were three separate times that it caused my Edge 500 to auto-pause and auto-resume repeatedly and not read parts of my ride. I wasn't sure what caused it the first two times, but the third time the spoke magnet had slid way out of position, so I decided to replace it with the one that I had on my Sigma cycling computer. Once I had done that, the unit worked flawlessly and I haven't had a problem since; it's only been a few weeks, however, so if that changes I'll update my review accordingly."
2,Woks on bikes but not on trikes,I own a trike (ICE Trice) and mounted the cadence sensor on a modified boom post. The senso works but it registers 200% of the rpm whenever it is active! I contacted Garmin customer service and they gave me a boilerplate response that did not help. I suspect that the speedometer sensor is also pulsing from the magnet on the crank arm...
5,Great sensor,"This item has added needed components to my bike for indoor training in the winter. The set up is fairly simple but does take a few fine adjustments to make sure that everything is lined up correctly. One problem I had (like other reviewers) was that I had to add a spacer of some sort to the back of the pedal cadence sensor. Other than that everything is working great. - Just FYI you may have to go into your Garmin's setting and add the cadence display - The instructions are not very good on how to find it, it's under display fields where you change what shows on main 1 and 2. Good Luck"
5,"Well Made, does what its supposed to","Easy installation. Make sure that the sensors and magnets are close but not hitting wheel spokes. Great product. Was recognized by my edge 500 instantly. No gripes from me at all.Included is everything that you need for installation, wheel and crank magnets, two types of chainstay pads, and zipties."
5,One of the best book about Elvis ever!,"Schilling is the smart guy around Elvis. The book is very well writen, full of good stories, photos. It took him a long way to do it, but it was worth waiting. Any fan can`t go withou it!"
2,Nice Book,"I have read this book awhile back and feel it's a nice story but alittle reserved for someone that was very close to Elvis. I like Jerry's honesty but prefer the reality packed Joe Esposito books like Remember Elvis and Elvis Straight UP. I have the sense that since Jerry is very close with the Estate , it might have had something to do with how careful he writes. At least he did not stoop down to the level of a Sonny West, Lamar Fike or that insane idiot Marty Lacker."
5,the amazing life of a spice,"The spice of life is a simply amazing book. The history of some of the spices mentioned in the book is superbly explained. It first caught my attention on a tv series some 20 years back and has since then left an enourmous impact in my kithchen. There is not once that when a topic comes about cooking that I do not mention the amazing chicken cooked in forty cloves of garlic or the other wonderful authentic recipes.The authors have done great justice to the book and could not have given it a better name than ""The spice of life""."
5,Melow and Fun,This show is perfectly suited toward youngsters who don't need the over stimulation of ridiculous shows like SpongeBob and the ilk.
5,Excellent value for Remington bkade heads,"I could not find a replacement head for my Remington Platinum Electric razor anywhere in the immediate area, so I went on line and found an excellent buy at Amazon.com. The last time I bought the same head at Walmart it was about $25 including tax. For $39.98 I received 2 heads, so I am fixed for about a year, thanks to Amazon.com., and I also saved about $12 !"
2,Buyers Beware,The product is faulty and doesn't work. Replacing the worn parts of the Remington electric shaver with the new ones was no problem but it does not cut. Very much disappointing and a waste of money. Had to purchse a new electric shaver. Would like to get a refund that was paid because the product was faulty.
4,Great for head shaving!,"I use this for shaving my head every other day. It cuts close, smooth, and cool."
3,"Not really a ""2 pack""","The product is fine and works well with my Remington shaver. I just wanted to let folks know that this really isn't a ""2 pack."" You get one of the pictured item (cutters and foils). I'm not sure where the ""2 pack"" description comes from ... it certainly doesn't mean you get two of these."
1,Replacing screens and cutters,I found the process of replacing the screens not the easiest. The picture that is on the replacement package is so small that you need a microscope to see what the steps are all about. You can not purchase the screens without the cutters. I only need screens yet I am forced to purchase the entire cutters and screens for over $25.00 Canadian. If I had done my homework in finding out what the replacement parts cost then I would not have purchased this shaver. I could buy a cheaper throw away shaver at the discount refurbished stores for a lot less and for under $25.00 have gotten a new shaver altogether that I could throw away at a cheaper rate than purchasing replacement parts from Remington.
1,never used,razor stopped working after a few weeks...Turns on and after a few minutes shuts off...even with a full charge.Was bought as a Christmas gift that don't work!These were not even opened( didn't get a chance!)
4,Shaver tune-up,"Never having had an electric before, I didn't realize the need to replace, periodically, the head and screen.... Once I did, it worked like new again.No complaints!"
4,EASY - no hassle,"Works great for years no problems! nice long cord, great replacement for a standard 9v power supply, or handy to keep around if you mess with lots of different pedals. Use the 5-plug adaptor (sold separately) to run power to your entire small pedalboard for cheap money!"
3,Great Adaptor - I get some buzz,"As other reviewers noted, this is a great product - I like the extra long cord, love it does its name which taking only 1 spot, and the accessories which are multiple plugs all off just this one adapter and the 9v batt imitation just make this an ideal product. And I love this product, and wanted to love it more.....BUT, in my case, I get a buzz, not a hum, a buzz, like another reviewer, in my setup. I am using the adapter with a 5 plug extension, and I've already tried swapping out adapters and extensions, and the buzz does not go away. I've also done testing on all my pedals, amp and cords, so I've isolated the issue to multiple power in my case. Powering each pedal separately does not invoke the buzz - just when using one 1-Spot plus the multi. So, IMHO, you's takes your chances."
5,the best entertainer on the planet!!!!!!!!,wow uncle willie is the greatest entertainer ever to come out of hawaii.you will watch this dvd over and over again.you will be amazed.
4,Good Book!!!,the book is quite a detailed travel guide to equidor and i sure as heck need something like that if im traveling thrue equidor on a vacation or to settledown there !!!
1,Feel ripped off,"This is a very attractive gadget but, like the previous reviewer, I feel it doesn't live up to its billing. I froze the container for more than 24 hours and yet the ice cream never firmed up enough to serve although the machine was left to churn for almost an hour. I may as well have mixed the recipe and just stuck the goop in the freezer for all that the machine did."
1,Do Not Buy!,I never write reviews but this thing worked so poorly I felt that it was my duty to warn people not to purchase it.
3,Deni Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker,I am giving this 3 stars not because of the seller. The seller is great! It is because Deni made a soft serve that is no good for a party of any kind. You can only use this product once every 24 hours. If you are looking for an ice cream maker make sure you do research and look up in Google for the intrctions. This makes about 3 sundae's than wait another 24 hours to make more. Too much time. Again the seller is good and prompt with deliveries. The product needs improvment. Not the seller's fault!
5,This Book was Very helpful and packed with info,"This book was great....it had how to get every secret including the gold,jade and silver dragon and how to get the guns. It has walk-thrus for every level of Tomb Raider 2 and for anyone who has Tomb Raider 2 this is a must have. Remember u havent beaten Tomb Raider 2 still uve gotten every secret!"
2,Left many stones unturned!!,"The book was mainly a text only book. In many cases the words were hard to connect to the reality of the game. Two examples:1.Near the beginning of the Opera House it took me two days to figure out where I was supposed to jump to to get the ORNATE KEY. 2. In 40 Fathoms, I'm stuck in the section ""Moving the Earth."" The book says to ""notice two holes in the roof ...they lead to different areas."" Well my room has three holes, two of which lead to the same area. Also, two of the three are INACCESSABLE! One is so high I can hardly see it! No clue given as to how to get up there. Compared to the pictures only book I bought for the original TombRaider, this Tomb Raider II book is abismal!"
5,LONG LIVE LARA CROFT!!!,"If you like Tomb Raider II you'll love this strategy guide. It has solutions for all the puzzles,bosses,traps,how to find every one of the keys,not to mention sure-fire ways to defeat every level,and tons of pictures of Lara and all the levels."
2,Buy another guide,"What made me buy this book is that it was the Official Strategy Guide of Tomb Raider II. I was mistaken. And very disappointed, not to mention.The graphic illustrations of the book were not clear for the average reader due to the highly pixelized photos (e.g. I couldn't even see the Stone Dragon in the picture). Also, the author may be too comfortable with the game that he was not able to take into consideration the new users; few details were given to achieve a certain objective or reach a certain place. It would have helped if a few objects chanced upon were mentioned for reference. To make it short, buy another guide.The only salvaging value of this piece is the physical make-up of the book--glossy paper with nice colors."
2,Gets the Job Done,"While I couldn't have finshed the game without the manual, I often spent as much time reading the manual as playing the game. The language in the manual is not very reader-friendly and is replete with mistakes; however, with trial and error and a little common sense, one can discern the book's mistakes and figure out the correct way to go about it."
3,OK,"Great clean shave. Good value for money. However the battery is weak. At best I get 3-4 shaves and don't even think about leaving uncharged for a few days, it will go dead."
2,Remington should recall these items,I feel that remington should recall these items. The Shaver is real good. But what's the use if the re-chargeable battery is so bad. I got two of these. One for myself and other a gift for my brother. He has the same battery issues. I see similar reviews about this product.I can't shave cordless for more than 10 secs. What's the point? I will never even consider a Remington product in future.
1,An uncomfortable shave,"After 7 months of use, I thought my neck was adjusting but no. It makes my neck sore. The charge on the battery does not last long. The plastic cover for the heads broke quickly and never fit snuggly. I will never buy Remington again"
1,Clearly not kid or parent tested!,"The concept is good for the 3 in 1, but the step stool portion does not lock into the potty ring base. So child knocks it over easily and a pain if you have to move it."
1,wouldn't recommend,"My daughter started potty training & within days she developed a dry scaly rash along the sides of her butt where contact was made with the seat. I stopped putting her on the 3-in-1 potty & started using a different potty seat & the rash went away within a day. I'm sure the design of the seat contributed to the skin irritation, since everytime she got off, you get see the red ring indent left from the ridge of the seat. So from my personal experience with the seat, I'd advise you to not buy it."
2,OUCH-$$$,"OK- I have been stung again-Had a Remington when I was 18-didn't know anything-Got another one when I was 35-- hated it-then got a Panasonic and loved it-Went back to Remington and I am back where I started-Metal discolors my face, whiskers drop all over the place,used 3 months(part time) and had to replace the cutter and foil-a $20.00 hit from Best Buy. No help from the Customer Service group- So bottom line- find another brand this is more of the same old stuff-although the battery does stay alive longer it has earned a 2--otherwise I would have rated it a 1."
3,Defective at delivery,"The razor works fine, but the battery was delivered defective. Out of the box I charged it up. After about 60 seconds of use, the ""RED"" low battery light came on. The razor seemed to be functioning OK, but the light was on. After 3 days of use (with red light on) I charged it overnight, and again after about 60 seconds of use the ""RED"" low battery light came on. The motor also seems to lose some of its hum when this happens. Battery was defective out of the box. Now I am faced with hassle of trying to get warranty service to replace the battery. Wish I had bought a different product."
4,Just like the nets at the main Home Improvement (H-depot) store.,"Hello,I can't really complain about of this but, I found out later that I could have got this exact item at Ho-me de-pot. I guess I just didn't look hard enough (located on the other side of where the fruit trees are). The thing is that at the store it was Cheaper in price, same product exactly but around 2 bucks cheaper. Oh well, at least It came to my door. Everything else was just perfect. The right thing, arrived on time, and was not too much more after all if you figure the cost of gas. Been on the trees since I got it and I am still happy."
4,Great against warm-blooded pests,"We have had an invasion of all kinds of warm-blooded pests this year: chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits. This netting appears very delicate, it doesn't block much sun, but is very resilient against the pests hungering for your tomatoes, strawberries, you name it... One roll contains enough to enclose 3-4 large tomato plants (individually wrapped). Because it is delicate, it is a bit wiggly to install on frames. Would recommend four hands for installing on frames. We used a staple-gun to affix the netting. Overall, good value for a handy person."
4,Aaron Carter rerun,"This DVD was OK, of course I love aaron, but most of the stuff on the video was repeates from tv. IT DID though contain a few not before seen stuff, but otherwise all of it was off tv.So if you missed it get it, or if your like me and have to have everything go ahead!"
4,An Okay Introduction,"This book is great as an introduction to economics. A bit outdated -- Galbraith talks a lot about oligopolies, which were more commonplace back in the late-'70s than today."
3,"Product Fine, Had to Return (see below)",It turned out the strap (a replacement) was not my problem. It was the Garmin unit itself. It has been almost a month and I have not seen a credit to my VISA card?
1,"Avoid, avoid!","After quite a bit of research, I let myself be snared by the word ""Titanium."" As if it were a good thing. I don't know if its the titanium or the design or what, but it leaves the skin of my neck burning for about 20 minutes after use - a problem I never had with other shavers, even very old ones. Now I'm back to hand-shaving, and only keep these for emergencies - if I have to run. What's worse, I've been scared out of buying other shavers, in case they are as bad as this. What a waste of money."
1,Worst product I ever bought,"Perhaps I purchased a lemon, but this was the worst product I ever bought. My old Norelco died after many years of dependable service. Tried this remington model. Didn't shave well at all, battery emptied frequently after 2-3 shaves, and trimmer broke as well. Customer service suggested that I send it back to them and wait. I ran back and back and bought a new Norelco within 6 months."
2,Wanna taking risk? then buy it.,It is a real pain-maker when shaving. The worst is its the battery that has unbelievable short life span! It should have been returned to Amazon long time ago.
2,Burnner,This shaver burns every time I use it. I do not have sensitive skin. I am sending it back to Remington.
1,Scare tactics,"This book sent my husband and me into a state of panic. The author would have you believe that a diagnosis of fibroids is something that alters the course of the rest of your life, and that every diagnostic test and therapeutic procedure is incredibly painful and invasive. That may be the case for some women, but not for all. We turned to this book after I was diagnosed with fibroids and, rather than giving us the information we needed to make educated decisions, it made us fearful of each step in the process. As it turned out, my fibroid (singular, something the book would have you believe never occurs)was removed surgically and I was back to work within 3 weeks, and my life has gone on quite happily. For women who don't know what to do when diagnosed with fibroids, I would recommend getting information from your doctor -- not this book!"
3,"Outdated, but imaginative","The Bears always think of things I wouldn't think of. That's what makes a book like this worth reading, even if it is 20 years old."
3,Good on the cheap.,"As stated in a review below to really cut close the trimmer must be used. I have a 2 screen shaver from remington which i replaced because the screens were messed up, and for the price i figured i could just buy a new shaver. This shaver doesn't really cut any better then my old 2 screen shaver. Both are average, and spit hair all over me. For cheap it's not bad. I don't regret buying it. But if you have a bigger budget i would look else where."
2,"Maybe it was a dud, but did not work",Purchased as a replacement for another Remington Titanium. This looked really good but you get what you pay for. It either did not hold a full charge or the RPMs on the this is really bad. Extremely slow and painful to shave with. Luckily Discount Jungle returnd money (after 15% fee and having to pay for shipping). BEWARE when buying online products such as these. I do alot of online shopping but got burned twice this past Xmas seascon when buying electronics. Will stick to local stores where I can return unsatifactory items without paying shipping.
2,Ok for $39,"I paid $59 at Rite Aid on sale. It is the loudest razer I have ever owned! The past 2 Remington's I have owned for about the same price were much better.The shave is OK, but the light is only green. It does not give a low battery warning, it died last week mid shave. You plug it in and the light is green, no indication if it is charging or not. The side burn trimmer does not extend when you push the button, you have to nudge it up.As a basic shaver it works OK, but I am not impressed at all. I wish I had kept my old one and had it repaired."
2,My second electric razor and I'm unimpressed,"I'm a 42 years old. I've ""water"" shazed my whole life. last christmas I bought an electric shaver for $5 at walmart. It was OK. I thought ""Wow! Wonder what an real shaver would do?"" I bought this Remington. I was very in impressed, as was my whole family. Even after using it for two months it still misses patches,a nd I'm forced to wet shave every third day to look presentable. The trimmer is nice though."
5,"wonderful, absolutely wonderful",wow! this is the only word that can describe Herbie J Pilatos book. i received it three days ago and read the entire book in only 3 hours. i was an absolute pleasure to read!
3,What happened??,"Only the first DVD of 3 has English voices. What a pity - the show is so ridiculous and the actors and actresses generally so good I love listening to it when busy. Ranpha's voice actress has been changed out as well for the first disc.This series is so sick. It's quite good for an anime comedy. Twisted. The animation could be better, but the fun of the characters and stories beats most all other anime series. It's one of those few series that realizes it is a big joke and just has fun with all the crazy scenarios using loser-girls as the focus of female personalities and vice.Angel X might be a weaker series than the others, but not much. I definitely see why GA was a success in Japan. Pity about this DVD set being incomplete."
2,Sorry,"I'll give it another chance, but upon listening to the first two song, I had to stop and make sure this was Sue Foley. I'm afraid this new direction is not for me. Something went terribly wrong."
5,rock solid,"Purchased steps and videos for my wife during daylight savings season since she can't get out to walk after work. With 2 steps to chose from she gets the workout that suits her mood after working all day. Steps are square vs. rectangle, are very solid, and don't skid on thick or berber carpet. Best of all, my wife is firming up and is working her way to being the hot-looking babe when I married her. YeeeeHawwwwww!!"
4,"Great workout, but you'll need weights","This workout is great and shows results. I have been working out for many years and this made my legs and buns hurt after the first try! The 3 workout options are great and user friendly. The only thing is you'll need some free weights to really reap the benefits. For beginners, probably 3, 5, 8lbs."
5,wow a great workout,This is a great work out. I love the firm DVDs. Their guaruntee is true you will see results after 10 workouts. WOW! If you want a challenging workout the firm will give that to you. I love it.
3,"It's ok, the dvd is horrible and useless","The steps are fine, could have used the stairs going to the basement in my house for most it...The dvd is so bad, no real person actually works out like that. I tried it a couple of times and thought it was so ridiculous that I threw it away. DON'T buy the DVD whatever you do, you will regret it."
2,it kicks somehow,"if it wasn't for Fabio's pic at the book's cover, it won't even buy it. Nah. Not that much but seriously, I like the story. At least the heroine here knows how to fight and no rape ( i think) was held on it compared against the first book. Her mother, Brenna, was twice been raped by her father, Garrick, on that book, one of Jl's irritable yet still managable to read stories.What is it with rape, rogues and women anyway?Oh well, from this trilogy of JL vikings, I like this the most though I much preferred Brenna than Kirsten for so many reasons."
5,Standard Delivery got it to me in two days!,I needed this for work and I have past experience with this scale. This is a great scale to use if you work if accuracy of 0.01 grams is enough for you.The seller got it to me really quickly using just the standard shipping. Very impressive.
5,Relaxing,"Love jazz music and if you love it too, you'll enjoy this album. The musicians and singers are local to Louisiana. Great music!"
3,"Not the best, but ...","The art and story is marginal, and Grievous isn't really the focus of the story (in that we learn nothing new about him), but it is a fun story nonetheless.As with all Star Wars stories from Star Wars, your enjoyment may come from how much you care about the characters focused on. Here they are disposable Jedi, but it still makes for an interesting read with no real conclusion.The series, which came out before ""Episode III,"" sold like hotcakes, as readers wanted to get as much info on the characters as they could. The General Grievous here is not the injured one we saw in the movie, but that makes no real difference to the story. What does make a difference is the young padawans he captures. That gives the tale its backbone, and makes it worth reading if only for that."
1,"Doesn't last, gone thru 2 and horrible service","I suggest that NO ONE buy thus product. When I was looking at reviews I saw a number of people who mentioned it just stops working- THEY ARE RIGHT. I orderd the item and in less than 2 weeks, and less than 8 hours of use it stoppedworking, so I returned it thru amazon and it was quickly replaced- but the second one stopped working in about 3 weeks. By then my 30 return with amazon was up. So I contacted the manufactor and they told me it would cost a minium of $40 to repair it, plus shipping to and from... Highly highly disappointed!"
3,Innotek Lap Dog Trainer,Haven't really figured out how it works and used it consistently. When I use it I think it does work. Not real sure it was worth the investment tho.
2,Difficult directions.,"The collar is in the drawer. I could not get it set and I got so frustrated, I quit. I am going to have someone else lookat it and see, if it is difficult to program or it's just me. I like easy and this is not easy to program."
3,Average,I got the lapdog trainer because my puppy is a shihtzu/maltese. After using for a few days I felt that the unit may have been inconsistent and that over time and much use the remote could possible wear and break as it is made of thin plastic and need one that is more durable and will last a long time.
4,Jumping,"Ordered this product to try and stop our small size dog from jumping on people when they come to visit. Works well, only need to use the sound correction most of the time and now just having the remote in my hand he will stop. Batteries don't last long only problem."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!,"This was a really great movie. If you love horses than this is the perfect movie. I think Raeanin was great for the part of Paige. Wind Dancer was the coolest. I like how she didn't have confidence until she realized, doing things by herself was not impossible."
2,Below average shaver,"I read all the reviews before I bought this shaver. There were a couple who didn't like the shaver. I agree with them.I think electric shavers should be quiet, shave close, shave fast, shave without irritation, and have some degree of quality.A close shave is one that you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against the direction of beard growth. This shaver did not shave close. After several weeks of shaving it still burns putting on after-shave.It takes too much time to shave.It is fairly quiet.The battery longevity is average.Construction quality is average for the price range.It is rated 2 stars overall. I will not replace the cutting head when it wears out but will discard the shaver."
5,good stuff,Well I did not buy this for a kid. I bought this for my sexy girl friend to wear in bed and it looks on her! Five stars!
4,hklove,i bought this hello kitty tank top set to wear it out casually. it's perfect for those hot summer day barbecues or night bonfires. i'm looking to pair it with skinny jeans.
1,where is it?,"I bought this for my wife for christmas. I am over in iraq so i couldnt be there, but as far as i am aware she still has not recieved this product."
3,you want strategy action. get it here,Crave entertainments did a good game with this.i only did the 1st mission to really give me a perspective hos the game. It has interaction buttons. graphics are pretty well made to recognize who character is each one of them. I dont know if the levels are repetitive but the 1st one you get to be in different areas. the story is nice. so its not an wow! game but to kill time will be more for it. dont miss it if its in good deal.
2,Poor supporting instrumentals and vocals.,"The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor. The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect. In other places, the supporting music is barely audible. The only singing occurs on track 12. I would recommend getting the cd ""Picture This"". It's much better."
2,A single song CD should not be called Piano SOLOS.,"I was disappointed because I had ordered a couple other Jim Brickman CD's, mostly just by title from ones I didn't have, and this one, entitled ""By Heart; Piano Solos"" is misleading. I was very saddened to find that I spent $8 on a single song. Next time I'll pay closer attention."
4,Facinating tale of a facinating man,"You could argue that this book is written in broad strokes, but so was Michael Todd's life. Fun rags to riches to rags to riches tale told with economy and showing all of the bad along with the good."
4,Works Perfect,This adapter is strong and sturdy. It fit perfectly on my existing hitch and my bike rack fit perfectly onto it.Couldn't be more pleased with the price and the quality! I gave it 4 stars only because it didn't include a boltwhich is not a big deal.
5,Very good product,"My Curt hitch for my Subaru is 1 1/4 inches. I purchased the Curt 18131 cargo basket that only fits into 2 "" receivers. This product allowed me to connect my cargo 2"" cargo basket to my 1.25"" hitch. It fit very well and is exactly what I needed. The alternative would have been to get a larger hitch with a 2"" receiver. I prefer the smaller 1.25"" hitch on a smaller vehicle as it looks better and is less visible."
2,Hitch adapter,Adapter fits loosely - too much play. Would be better if it had multiple holes on male end to mount deeper into car receiver.
1,doesn't fit,"When putting this adapter onto my 1.25in receiver, the pin holes do not line up. They are off by about a quarter inch, and I wasn't able to slide a pin it at all. After reading the other reviews for this adapter and other similar hitch adapters (people dealing with having to sand them down, etc) I have given up. I have had to give up on this adapter theory and just purchased a whole new hitch for my truck."
2,Good item but causes conflicts,"I got this item cheap because I really like the game columns, but once you install the game controller it causes conflicts with your Hot Sync function. I tried several times and this kept occurring. Sorry. Unless you just play a lot of games on your handheld it just isn't worth the hassle of having to reinstall your cradle drivers after you have used the controller."
3,still in search,"I had been looking for the jukebox recording of The Rodeo Song,done by The Parriot Band??? At least that's what it looked like on the juke at a redneck bar, flip side had The(...)Song. The song on this cd sounded way too flat for my taste. Oh,Well. But still searching for the one I heard many years ago."
1,Great if you like to shave with a corded razor,"This is the 3rd Remington razor I have purchased. I replaced the previous 2 after their rechargable batteries would no longer hold a charge. This new razor barely holds its charge for 24 hours. So, you're basically left with using the razor while its plugged in. I'm seriously thinking of taking advantage of the warranty and getting my money back."
3,Battery Life - minus,"I have been using Remington Microscreen razors for probably 20 years. My old razor was on its last legs, so I went for the best model of Remington. I based my decision on product reviews, Internet research, and my belief that Remington produced a quality product. I am very disappointed with battery life. The charge indicator will only stay in the green zone for 2 or 3 shaves and then goes red. I have a light beard and my shaves are short, I never use the turbo mode and rarely use the trimmer. Frankly, I expected a lot more from Remington. But, in closing, I must admit that the shave is as good as any Remington that I have ever owned."
4,MY 2ND ONE,THIS IS MY 2ND ONE . THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT FINDING THE REPLACEMENT BLADES AT THE DRUG STORES. I NOTICE THAT ONE PERSON SAID THAT IT DID NOT HOLD IT'S CHARGE . THE TWO THAT I HAVE LAST FOR ABOUT SIX DAY ON ONE CHARGE . IT HAS BEEN A RULE IF YOU CHARGE IT FOR AT LEAST 24 HR U. WILL NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM ! THE TURBO WORKS GREAT !
3,Only complaint is the calibration certificate,"Great product, works as advertised. Bought it for use in the R&D; facility of our manufacturing company. The only complaint about it has to do with the calibration certificate. The lighted display as well as accuracy of the wrench is excellent and allowed us to perform some breakaway torque measurements that would have been difficult to perform with a standard wrench.It came with a calibration certificate that contained everything we need to satisfy ISO requirements. However, when looking closely we noticed that it was calibrated with a piece of equipment that was overdue for calibration itself. So we have had to take it out of service until we can have it calibrated ourselves. Had to deduct a couple stars due to the calibration problems."
5,Fabulous Tool - Well worth the money!,"I have had my Gearwrench 1/2"" drive Electronic Torque wrench for appoximately 2 years and I can assure you that you will Not regret purchasing this tool if you appreciate quality workmanship. This wrench does not disappoint, I keep it it the top most drawer of my tool chest and never leave it in the truck where it might get stolen or heat damaged. I considered the Snap-On brand of torgue wrench but chose to spend less for this tool and I was not disappointed. Go ahead, bite the bullet, add it to your cart, and then wonder why you waited so long to own it."
2,"""Not at all what I expected.""","This video series was rather boring. So boring that I returned it. They keep showing mostly the same pictures over and over again. They also show current pictures of various places in England and if you are trying to visualize say what Bath looked like in her time, the bus going by and the people in modern dress throw you off. The narrator, while somewhat informative, has a very monotone voice. I just couldn't wait for this set to arrive and after I made it through the first tape, there was nothing that prompted me to watch the second and third right away!"
1,Ice Machine Review,"We purchased two of these machines and they both have the same problem. About every other day the sensor that detects that the ice ben is full doesn't work. The machine continuesto make ice until it jams and shuts itself off.I have just pulled the plug, waited for about 15 seconds then plugged it back in. It works fine for another day or so.I was cheap and that proves the theory that you get what you pay for!"
1,Do not buy this iceamker,"Worked well for one week then got the add water/water won't inject light with plenty of water in the reservoir. From that point on if you shut it off and back on it will make one tray of ice. Then it stops. If you turn it off/on it will make another tray and stop, etc, etc, etc. If you leave it on it will eventually make another tray about 2 hours later and continue doing that but after each single tray the water light comes on and nothing happens for the next 2 hours. Really frustrating."
3,Works well but limited to home use,"I purchased the NewAir portable ice maker for our local senior center after the commercial ice machine died. A commercai replacement would have cost $1500 to $2000, so the portable machine was an attractive alternative. The center serves lunch 3 times a week and this winter the cooks have been able to keep up with the demand by bagging ice and keeping it in the freezer, but we will need to find another alternative this summer when the demand will be much greater. The machine would be more than adequate for home use though."
1,It worked great for a week ...,"After having made about 6-7 cycles of ice, the machine stopped working. It sounded as if it were making ice, but stopped after 10 minutes. There was a greasy substance in the bottom of the unit after the problems began. I had such high hopes for this unit!"
4,it keeps going and going,"bought this ice maker before summer and didn't think it was going to make it but it's a champ! it keeps going and going, makes ice every day and night. perfect for a single person who needs some ice for a few cocktails. also thought it was going to make my power bill go sky high but i didn't even notice a change. it is a little loud when the compressor turns on and you need to keep it's fan on the side clear. i also recommend using distilled water if you want clear ice"
4,Excellent acting makes this a sure bet,"This is an interesting biography of eccentric racing demon Sir Henry ""Tim"" Birkin whose racing victories in the 1920's and 30's are still legendry. Rather than leaning on a whole life biography, the film allows Rowan Atkinson (as Birkin)to explain the things that were most important to him, racing itself and his rivalry and friendship with the ""Bentley Boys"". It includes some great vintage and faux vintage footage. The best part of this short classic program is the exceptional acting. Rowan Atkinson shines. Geoffrey Palmer's short role as Birkin's father is excellent.""Ghost writer"" Crispen Bonham-Carter is extremely believable and Ken Kitson(as Birkin's right hand man)shows off his superb supporting skills. My one criticism is that they tried to cram too much into one hour. This should have been extended into it's own mini series for depth."
5,best biography ever read,"This is Jane straight talking, in very much her own words. Her life is quite a story and a very interesting read, once I picked it up I read it straight off. Very advisable to buy for aspiring female boxers who need a real role model not just an image or for anyone who is interested in a broader spectrum of boxing."
4,Perfect for my number 1 all over do.,Im probably not the best person to review this complete haircut kit as I literally shave my head short (number 1) all over. However for this persom they are great. They feel very well made and durable. They are extremely sharp and not having to oil them is a very welcome feature. They hold their charge well enough. As for the other 21 pieces in the set I can really comment as I wont be using them but they look of a decent quality. Shame remington cannot introduce a stand alone clipper set without all the fancy accessories for a cheaper price for those who just buzz cut though.
4,Charge doesn't last long,"These clippers work very well. However, you have to finish quickly before the charge runs out (I've said that somewhere else, before)."
2,won't last long....,Got these at a reasonable price-they worked ok for a few months and got dull real quick. Tried to find replacement blade-no luck. I guess I'll get a more expensive haircut machine-it is not worth another chance.
4,Great overall product !!,Used the product and satisfied with it so far. I have tried to use the trimmer which does not seem to work with re-chargeable batteries.Overall I will definitely recommend this product. I do not have any hair pulling experiences as described in other reviews.
3,Great for a year,"I bought these clippers a year ago. They have been outstanding for that time period. The other day it stopped cutting and left me with half a haircut. Fortunately, there is a barber shop nearby and he fixed it. The blades are dull after one year. It still saved me on haircuts though."
1,Dull after 4 cuts,"I bought this product, dreaming of the freedom of cordless hair cutting, cut my hair once and the next time it was too dull to cut. I contacted Remington for warranty service and they made me send it in to get a new one. That one went dull after 5 haircuts. Better, but really wasteful. I can't figure out where to get replacement blades, but I can't see how it's worth it as they will probably be of similar quality.I don't have wiry hair; I have fine hair (and not much of it). This is just a failed product. On the plus side the motor and battery seem to be pretty good, but that doesn't do you any good unless you just like to listen to the sound of a clipper running.Don't waste time and money with this item - go with Wahl or maybe Oster (I had an acceptable Oster that lasted about 4-5 years)."
2,Make Your Own,"I bought this when I decided to start potty training my daughter who loves Dora. I ended up just making my own. There wasn't a lot of space for stickers. The card was filled up really quickly. This costs almost $7. For less than $5, I made my own that lasted a lot longer than a few days."
1,Could not be a MORE BORING talking head DVD! :-(,"I bought my copy from Rolando's website but wish I had bought it from Amazon instead so that I could have returned it.Not only is this THE most boring talking head DVD I ever had the frustration of watching it also has very poor production values overall in my opinion. The sound is so spotty that it's difficult to make out the audio at times. Additionally, there were video difficulties and breakups as well. I literally fell asleep watching this DVD.I wish I could have given 0 stars instead of the minimum 1 star Amazon has available. Yes, it's that bad. :-(If you're truly interested in a well-made video on good glamour photography you'd be much better off tracking down and buying a used copy of one of Ken Marcus' videos. He was a long-time Playboy photographer and not only does it show in the end result but the production quality, and more importantly, the *content* is fantastic compared to this one amateurish DVD production by Gomez. Save your money."
2,"I just didn't ""get"" it","Maybe it's because I'm not French. I don't know. But I definitely didn't think this was Bruce's best work by a long shot. As a huge Bruce Campbell fan, I had been awaiting this release for a long time. The result was a movie that didn't live up to my expectations. It had its moments, but overall I was dissapointed. This is the kind of movie I would have loved to watch in my college French class, though."
4,My sons favorite Boohbah,The hot dog story is my son's favorite. He doesn't care much for the second story but has watched the hot dog episode many many times.
5,White Lion's Lady,"I really liked this book. Exciting story, and romantic! After this one, I had to read the next two books. It was that good"
1,Cheaply engineered!,"I used this for about 15 days with no problems, then the loud squeeling started from the fan axle, followed by a greese like substance flung out onto the surrounding area, including me. Then the fan resistance/ pull effort nearly doubled. Finally, by day 45. the pull mechanism snapped from underneath and the machine was dead. Stamina Customer Service was no help as they expected me to tell them what type of repairs/replacements were needed. Since I had no clue, they said there was nothing they could do. What I expected them to do was a total replacement of the machine, or refund. Hopefully, the refund is forthcoming as I've sent this back to them."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this product because my mom wanted something light weight to clean her carpets with. Thought i would give this a try.Not worth the money or time to order it. Did not work even the first time used. Leaked real bad and the trigger stuck. Would not recommend this to anyone. We just threw it away, not even worth the time to send it back."
4,He should've written more novels,"I believe this is the only novel written by the author of ""To Sir, With Love."" I read this a couple of months ago, so am not fresh on the details, but when I saw there was NOTHING about the book here, I thought I'd give you what I remember. It's about a boy's guilt and grief and fear surrounding an incident where he and his brother harrass a black boy who fights back and ends up dead. It was his portrayal of how the mind works that makes me wish he'd written more novels. I also remember thinking it'd be a good book for a class on grief to include in its discussions."
4,"Some things I didn't like, but overall an enjoyable read","I'm a bit mixed on how to rate this book. I'm not a gamer, so I had no preconceptions from the video game going in, one way or another. At least one other reader who is a gamer has told me he liked the game much better, but then I'm not sure it's a fair comparisson.On the negative side, I think the author got carried away with some of the technical descriptions of weapons and things. Also, he used both first person and third person narrative in essentially alternating chapters. That made for a bit of a jarring experience, especially in the early part of the book. Either I got used to it or it smoothed out later on, but it seemed to be better.I did enjoy the overall story, though it was fairly predictable. But then most of the plots in this genre are if you've read enough of them. It was perfectly fine for my daily commute reading, though.I guess the bottom line is that I enjoyed it enough to continue reading the series."
2,Lazy Writing,"The plot is too simplistic. It is a lazy, production type of writing. Imagine some one can start a war by sending two emails with phony audio cuts?! And a brilliant terrorist could send a stealth bomber in the bright daylight and didn't expect to be detected?! Our country's survival is depended on the stupidities of terrorists and one superman. A smart high school kid can write a book like this, but Tom Clancy is supposedly doing a lot better than that. Or, maybe not??"
5,Non Stop Action,When I started reading this book I couldn't stop needless to say I read it cover to cover in one sitting.
1,False Advertising,"It's pretty obvious that the publishers want you to think thisbook was written by Tom Clancy. I was looking for any TomClancy book to take with me on vacation, when I picked thisone up by mistake. I was extremely disappointed when I openedmy suitcase, picked up the book, and discovered my mistake.I read it anyway, thinking the writer might be okay if TomClancy is willing to put his name on the book. It wasn't theworst book I ever read, but it was mostly a waste of time. Thestore was bland, and the writing lacked style. I won't readanother book by the author, and I don't think I'll be goingnear any more Tom Clancy books either."
1,Tom Clancy should be sued,"Tom Clancy and his money hungry publisher should be sued for deceptive advertising. My not-so-observant mother keeps buying me these childish ""Tom Clancy"" books as gifts, thinking they are the real deal. They aren't. Laughable I'd call them. Absolutely awful. I guess if you were 12 and addicted to this splinter cell video game you may find some pleasure in the read, but this book is truly bad. Only book I've ever had that I promptly threw in the trash-worse than a National Inquirer."
4,Native and New Age well blended,"Though the two ""Sacred Spirit"" CD's continue to be my favorite AmerInd music, this one is almost equally well done. Spotted Eagle's flute provides the leading motif on all the tracks, joined by muted drums, traditional chant (as in ""Bii'saao'beh"" and ""Brother, Father, Warrior, Son""), and contemporary European instruments. Most are slow and contemplative, but ""House Made of Dawnlight"" makes me imagine dancers moving lightly over grass (perhaps Native pixies, if there are such things), and ""Little Ritual,"" with its deep-toned male-chorus chanting, sounds like just that. I'll be looking for more CD's by this artist."
3,Casual dinnerware,This Corelle Set came a bit warped on the large plates. It is a nice set but I will not purchase additional sets from Corelle as quality was lacking.
2,Mixed feelings,We have used the Pixma MP 160 for about 2 to 2 1/2 years. The only problems I have found with it is that the ink cartridges cannot be refilled and the ink could hardly be called inexpensive. My wife is a Kindergarten teacher and prints a lot of material on the printer at our expense. The 2nd problem will discourage me from buying Canon again. The part that is called an ink absorber wipes clean the ink cartridge heads has become full of ink and the printer smudges or streaks all the papers. The fix for this? Take it to a Canon authorized dealer and pay more than the printer was worth new to have it cleaned or replaced. That is ridiculous. They should have engineered it so that the consumer could have cleaned or replaced that part. I really hate to think about this going to the dump because of a piece of sponge but a lot of time and research has resulted in few answers.
3,It's an overall good printer for the money,"This is a really good printer for the money, but if your looking for a printer specifically for printing pictures this would not be a good buy. The pictures come out ok, but my mother-in-law has a printing doc for her kodak easyshare camera and that's way better then this. This printer is easy to setup, easy to use, reasonable price wise, but it's not the best for picture printing."
2,First impression can be deceiving,"Have had this printer for a couple of years now. Use it primarily for home and student, mostly printing. Light use for picture printing, but has done a good job. Best feature is easy set up. Receives a low rating because it uses a lot of ink unless you set it to fast and grayscale (Cartridges are expensive ... the best deal on cartridges for this printer can be found at Costco.), and because the paper feed has gone bad in this short time. I have two other Canon printers in my house and have passed them onto my children. These other two printers have lasted the same use or worse for much longer ... and the children have them because the cartridges are inexpensive and seem to last a long time (getting harder to find though). I am throwing this one in the trash today and currently online looking over the ratings at Amazon, Walmart, and Consumer Reports, to find a new one. I hope that this review helps, as I rely on reviews from others all the time."
2,ok,These bars are very chewy although I quite liked the taste I probably wouldn'y buy them again. I like a lighter more crumbly bar.
4,Great stuff,"I saw the group when i was watching the movie Stuntrock. The music is solid and pure. Just the way i like it. The music they make is hard to describe, what i can tell is that it's one of it's kind and in my opinion a must have."
5,Its about time...,"I have spent the last three years building Project/Program Management Office (PMO) infrastructures, processes, systems and project manager training programs. The reason I love this book is that it explains the vital need of strategic planning for successful project management. Most of the project managers I have worked with have little, if any strategic planning training. We have had a significant amount of success with the projects where we started with a strategic planning session. It is about time that someone wrote a meaningful and useful book on strategic planning for project management. Thank you Harold Kerzner."
3,Expensive,These bags work fine but they aren't cheap.We cut the ends off and dump them out then re-roll the end up and duct tape it shut to re use the bags. 2-4 uses depending on how the bag looks.
1,john hawkins,"the bags are too clumsy, you may buy a better bag from Rigid.part # VF2004 5-8 gallon Home Depot"
3,Generic bags,"These are generic vacuum bags, not Fein brand. The seller did not list this in the original description. However, the quality looks similar to the Fein bags. Time will tell."
4,fein vacuum bags,what can I say. its vacuum bags for a fein shop vac. my husband handles them in his shop. He loves the fein wet/dry vac
5,Used to be the bomb,"VOJ used to be the hype stuff...Regina, Keith, Stephen Erika, Marva, man they made VOJ something special. This CD was so hyped..Too bad all of those members left and the new CD does not have the same sound quality as that group.THings happen for a reason....Ethan get this sound back.Holla"
2,Not what it is cracked up to be,"The author of this book says that it is a ""feminist reinterpretation of the wives of Henry VIII."" I do not think that this is the case. It does not have any new information, just stuff that has been said in many, many other books about the lives of his six wives.Another thing that I did not like about this book is that she spends alot of time talking about different things that have nothing to do with the story that is being told, which I found to be weird. Also she did not even get the wives correct. The wives went ""Divorce, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, beheaded, survived."""
4,Classic Curious George,"I had this book growing up, and now that I have a child who is obsessed with Curious George due to the PBS TV show, I wanted to share this sweet, simple story with him. Yes, the description of the hospital stay is antiquated, but the overall message stands the test of time - that doctors make you feel better and the hospital need not be scary."
2,Works fine - until heat problems started,"A cable modem is a fairly uninteresting beast. It pretty much works or it doesn't. This modem caused no problems for about 3 months of operation then just died. Reboot. Dead. Reboot. Dead. Turn it off for a while. Alive for 5 minutes - then dead. Have temporarily solved the problem by yanking the circuit board out of the case, hooking up all the connectors and hanging it in front of a small fan. It's not elegant - but it's been up ever since.Maybe their newer model (which looks to have some holes in the case) doesn't have this issue. Maybe I have a lemon. It's a really nice aluminum case - just doesn't seem to allow for cooling."
1,Not reliable!!,"I bought this modem for two months, and it starts to disconnect my internet why I am using video chat. I have to plug off and on again. Not reliable at all!"
2,A disappointment,"I remember when Hasbro restarted the Star Wars figure line in the mid-1990s. I was really look forward to getting the Tusken Raider because I always thought they looked so majestical in the film. However, I was disappointed with this figure. It just seemed like Hasbro didn't know how to handle the cape. It looks odd and is split down the sides, showing the Tusken's undergarments (he looks like a mummy). Also, he could only hold the gaffi stick in one hand because the other was permanently closed. Fortunately, nearly a decade or so later, Hasbro released theStar Wars 3.75 Vintage Sand People Figure, which is absolutely stunning."
5,Vise is excellent for making earrings.,"My father tied flies and I remembered his vise. I thought it would be great for making earrings. I am a jewelry designer. This vise does just what I hoped it would. It speeds up my production and streamlines my product. Besides that, I always think of my father when using it."
2,New York is not equal to Manhattan,"I borrowed this book from a friend due to the fact that my NYC trip was unplanned. I usually am a Lonely Planet fan, but I was left with no choice but to use this one. I am impressed with the quality of the book, and yes, I do agree that this is one that can be browsed after the trip, and not forgotten in an attic. However, the coverage is completely restricted to Manhattan, and the rest of the boroughs are condensed into a ""Farther Afield"" section. New York City is not equal to Manhattan. Although most of the sights are in Manhattan, I am sure that there are plenty of other sights to see in the other boroughs as well."
2,MasterCook for Mac,"Years ago, when Sierra still owned MasterCook, there was a Mac version...and I LOVED it. There was even a promised upgrade, which never came through. (I believe that was about the time Sierra sold MasterCook.) My understanding is that they have no intentions of continuing the Mac version. Perhaps those people looking for the Mac version can find a used one somewhere, although it will only run in Classic mode. I'm currently looking for a cookbook program for my windows laptop, and am not sure I will support a company without active development, out of concerns of what happens when windows upgrades... But, overall, the program delivers what was promised, for now."
3,Bought this because last (cheaper) one was no good.,"Bought a cheaper book first and it was pretty much useless, so I got this one and got some good out of it. Don't do all for you as photo shop is a pretty complex produce, but I am using it often now and this book helped."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"This is just a pleasure to read. Timelines, illustrations of lots of covers, including pulps. A definite must have.The pictures are great, having book covers and covers from pulps, and movie shots, and character pieces all adds to the enjoyment of a browsing type of book. Fine work."
4,Educational & Entertaining,I was looking for an education on typical Amish idiosyncrasies as it relates to girls and women in the culture. This was the best story for that goal in that it revealed both their innocence and how truth can be situational when pushed into a corner (allowing that it was not necessarily based on a true story). It was also well acted and scripted which made my education also entertaining. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Not bad but not the greatest either...,Excellent acting from Mariska and Alison though this would've better as a two-or-three part mini series than a tv movie. Not a great adaptation of Jodie's book but not bad either. The script changed alot of things and omitted some. I recommend to fans of Mariska (great actress in all she does) but I suggest you read the book after watching the movie...
1,Disappointment,This movie really made me just mad. I loved the book. The best part is when ellie finds out she is pregnant. They totally left that part out. It would have maded the movie 100% better. If you are expecting just like the book then dont buy this movie. It doesnt really give details on how cope and ellies relationship crow more when they find out she is pregnant and she ends up with all the complications she goes through. Sorry had to get that off I just finished the movie.
1,T-Fal 4.5-Inch Nonstick One Egg Wonder Problem,"I recently received my T-Fal 4.5 inch Nonstick One Egg Wonder in good physical condition.It really looks cute, and appears to be very well built. I then followed their instructions to condition the fry pan's surface.When I tried cooking my first scrambled egg at a low temperature on my gas stove,The bottom of the egg was over-cooked and the top of the egg was still runny.This pan is much too small to flip the egg over, and I do not know if a miniature spatula even exists.This really means that it needs a lid on order to cook the top side of the egg also.Per an email response from the manufacturer, they cannot not supply a lid, even as an option.Now, I will need to try to find a lid from somewhere else, and it most likely will not fit very well.Therefore, I do not recommend this item, and I give it a very poor rating.Richard"
2,Product was not as I expected,"First of all, I understand that I can only expect so much from a product priced this low. Nevertheless, I did hope that this pan would work well for a much longer period of time that it ended up working. I liked its size, it fits a single egg perfectly. The construction is OK, nothing extremely solid but it feels sturdy enough.The biggest upset had to do with the nonstick coating. I followed the care instructions religiously, but after just about a week of daily use I noticed that the pan has started to loose its nonstick properties in a couple of small spots, so every time I attempt to cook something with it, even after applying some cooking oil, it will stick to these problematic areas.All in all, I am not satisfied with the product but I can't say I lost too much because I didn't exactly expect it to be that great based on the price."
2,Small mini gift book. I had no idea.,Small mini gift book. I had no idea. I thought this read would be great when I read it's description. Not much to read. This mini gift book fits in the palm of your hand.
5,Vitamin E Cream,"Excellent for skin care. Comes in the tube or a jar and is good for wrinkles, scars, etc. The etc is the best part."
5,"Oh, My Goodness...","I bought this CD, blindly, based on the reviews. I don't do that as a rule, however I am so glad I did. What a beautiful CD. The music virtually lifted me above what I heard in that I became infiltrated with it. Hauntingly beautiful!"
3,Not a bad idea to get it ...,"... especially for a clueless man ... kind off ""how to be a daddy for dummies"" ... not to crazy about it but wont hurt to watch it."
4,Cute and Funny,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot."
3,Disappointed,"My granddaughter waited for the arrival of this package and there was a joy in receiving it...the shirt,she loves, and it was all going well until she put the disk in the player to watch and it did not work out well at all. I will probably steer clear of this type of item in the future."
4,Great buy!!,"This does exactly what it says it will do, has great sound, easy to set up and get started, lots of tones and other options. Overall great product but let me add a few things I wished were different.More rhythmsKeyboard does not save last tone when you turn it off ( you may be able to do this but I have yet to figure it out)Many of the songs included are lameCasio includes a service where you can download more songs but they have like 50 songs there and it seems like a web site that they may have forgotten about since many of the ""coming soon"" dates are from 2000 and 2001. Also, you cant download the songs directly to your keyboard they remain on your PC.If these features are not important to you then this is a great buy."
3,Moderately Good T'ai Chi Book,"There is only one real problem with this book which caused me to rate it three stars: The information written within the book is fine and very useful with many insights which make the book worth buying. However, there are no pictures nor diagrams to show examples of the information that is written. This causes some difficulty while reading. Although I do acknowledge that the author probably did this on purpose to make the reader get up and do the exercises. So, that being said, this book would be most beneficial for someone who already knows a form of Yang style T'ai Chi. All in all, three stars for difficult and sometimes confusing display of written material, but still a good book."
1,Not what I was looking for,"In my opinion, this book is not for someone who wishes to homestead either organically or ""naturally"". Right off the bat, the authors mention GMOs and defend their existence by claiming that man is always going to be looking for better ideas, so there's no point in arguing their merits! They admit that GMOs are not strictly 'cross-breeding', but restructuring DNA at the cellular level (and NO ONE knows what will come of that), but again, simply shrug that off as progress. There are other unfortunate misconceptions in it as well, and not a lot of detailed information regarding the various breeds of animals, nor why you should husband one type over another depending upon your needs. All-in-all, this isn't about sustainable homesteading, more like how to create a smaller home version of modern factory farming techniques. Not what I was looking for, at any rate..."
4,Great little cook book,"I've tried a few recipes so far and I liked most of them (the Black Bean Hummus and Coconut Soup were delicious!). I also like the fact that most of the recipes are quite simple and don't require fancy/exotic ingredients, but still manage to be tasty. Some pictures would have helped, but it's not a major drawback. I don't give it 5 stars because some of the recipes are a bit repetitive. But all in all I'm glad I bought this book, it's well worth the money."
2,turgid and polemical,"Yes, as the book's back cover says, this book is largely forgotten today. Maybe for good reason. It is a shrill, turgid and polemical screed about doing over the American government. The hero, if that term might be used, overthrows the government in a putsch. He then institutes a radical restructuring of American society, along the lines of a socialist fantasy.The book was written in 1912 and thus predates the rise of Lenin, Mussolini and Hitler. Yet it carries within itself the echoes of those fanaticisms. If you are an American and actually want to read this miserable screed, do so and be grateful that it remained a dark fiction."
3,Beautiful design but marked up,We got these for our wedding 10 years ago. I have always loved the design but cannot keep up with the marks left by our flatware. I came across the set on my search for new dishes and just had to comment. We wouldn't be getting new dishes if it weren't for the annoying gray marks!
2,Sprayer,"Works Ok, but he wond leaks even if you try to keep it tight. I have replaced the O rings, but no help."
3,Lisa Jankovic,I saw this movie on Australian TV a few months ago and loved it and knew I had to have it as part of my DVD collection.I have been a huge fan of Dean Cain since he was in Lois and Clark and have been following his career ever since. I was never a real fan of Denise Richards until I saw her in this movie. Both actors shine in their roles and you know they both had great fun making this movie.I recommend this to movie to anyone who is looking for a few hours of fun and and of course a happy ending...which is what we are all looking for.Order a copy of this DVD from Amazon today.
3,Neutral,"This was the second book I turned to after having gone through ""The Anger Workbook"" by Les Carter. While Dr. Harbin calls a spade a spade and clearly debunks our common copouts for why we are angry, I found his book to be more of a survey, versus a self-help manual. Certainly I learned from him, and his words forced me to see some hard facts, but I did not find his few exercises to be realistic for me. The Anger Workbook constantly turned the questions over to me and my situation i.e. ""given examples such as these, what are some areas in your life where you have had similar reactions or feelings?"" It helped me explore the how's and why's of my anger. This book may be better for a spouse or friend of an angry person looking to understand and help. Valuable no doubt. But if you are looking for help finding the roots of your anger, this may not be the best choice. However, if you are thinking you may have an anger problem, please read something!"
5,If You Have An Ager Problem...,"I never thought I had a real anger problem. Sure, I got mad, yelled, etc. on occasion. Who hasn't? Imagine my surprise that after waiting and planning for three years, my wife told me she was too afraid of my temper to start a family with me. That's when I decided I needed to try and change. I took the test at the beginning of the book and found that I was bordering on being an angry man. So many of the things he pointed out suddenly became very clear. After reading the book, I realized how much anger had hurt my wife, often without me knowing. I have never physically hurt her but my words did as much damage. It has been four months since I have read the book and I have not yelled or lost my temper, even once. I do not credit this book for all of this nor would I say it could work so well for everyone, but it really pointed me in the right direction. If you have been told you have an anger problem or if you think you might, I would highly recommend this book."
5,Cruz Paints a Compelling Cuban Portrait,"In ""Anna in the Tropics,"" Nilo Cruz emulates events occuring within the story by segments of ""Anna Karenina"" read aloud by the lector. The character in the novel who work within the cigar factory relate to the lector, who has come to give them education in the form of his novels, in many different ways. Affairs, deception, and love occur at the hands of one man and the Tolstoy novel. This much deserved Pulitzer Prize winner never allows the reader to drift. Each word appears to be carefully chosen by Cruz to enstill some sense of dramatic and literaty awe. I found myself laughing, crying, cheering and smiling at the characters relationships and Cruz's amazing ability to create a wonderful story. I've read an unhealthy amount of plays lately and I can wholeheartedly say that this is the ""best."" I highly reccomend any fan of theatre, hispanic culture, or life/relationships pick this up right away!"
5,Christmas music for the soul,"This is a great CD! I generally go for really traditional Christmas music, but this adds a soothing, contemporary element to those familiar carols, in a purely instrumental form. The blends of sounds, the moods conveyed, all come together to give a wonderful listening experience. This intimate music makes you feel melancholy and wanting to snuggle up to your loved one."
5,this book keeps you on your toes!,the price of an orpan was the first book i had read by patricia carlon. for 2 days i could not get my nose out of the book. she kept the mystery of hte killer going until the right moment. i look forward to reading her other books. i would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense.i hope you enjoy and happy reading!
4,Good buy!,"We bought this product because we have a small basement and needed to figure out the best way to finish it for maximum space. My husband and I are both very happy with it, architecturally (placement of walls, space, cabinets, etc.) It is very easy to use and has done everything we have needed it to do. Whenever we've had questions we've called customer support and they have been extremely helpful. We have not used it for landscape yet, so I'm not sure how it is for that. As far as design goes (sofa fabric, wood color, etc.), it is adequate. It has a lot of options, it's just not very life-like(like a real picture). But it has been good enough for us to get a great idea of what it will look like. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,Not that bad...,"I have had this printer for about 4 months now and I have to say that for basic printing needs, it isn't that bad. I know it has a slot for photo ink, but I haven't used it for that so I don't know about its photo quality. Overall I would give it a 3 star rating because it's cheap and gets the job done."
4,hp deak jet d2330 printer,"bought this printer for our grandchildren to use with our old computer, they love it, so do we, it's compact, works excellent, and takes a beating. (as we know children are impatient, ""are we there yet"") no matter how they treat it, it keeps on working."
2,Misleading,"Everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it doesn't come with the USB cord to hook the printer to the computer, and that IS a LITTLE important. Also, I have Windows Vista, and the printer is not compatible with it, I have to download a patch, but that was my own fault. I guess you get what you pay for..."
4,Used for non-erotica too,"I bought this book when my own book got stalled at the love scene. I did not, and do not really intend to write Erotica -- I was looking for help with the scene, insight into what makes heat and what makes hokey. It provided me insight into what is needed for such a scene, and allowed me to identify what was missing and keeping my own from working.In addition to that, the book also covers the basics for writing a romance: plotting, characterization, dialog tips, etc. I would have paid the book price all over again just for that one section that ended up busting the love/sex scene block I had. Have reco"
4,This is an excellent book for killing a few hours,"This is not the world's most serious or enlightening science-fiction, but it IS fun.All three stories in this book are fun romps through the future and are well worth the time it takes to read them. All are epics of the struggle of man over nature and ferocious space-faring aliens."
3,poor fm reception,"it came out of the box new with scratches already all over the top of it from the factory. the reception is terrible and i dont like the fact it has no remote. i do however like the blue display, the design and the projection that you can tilt back and forth to either view on the ceiling or the wall. i will be returning it for a different model because good fm reception is a high priority and i now realize i'm going to want to be able to control it by remote"
1,NOT GOOD,"The bad:The LCD screen is not readable at night unless you are at eye levelIt DOES NOT have an insert for the Ipod nano 3G. It says ipod nano but the insert is for the tall skinny nano not the square tiny one.The projector is not visable in the day time only at nightAt night the LCD is too bright and lights up your whole room in blue.The plug in a huge and chunky (weighs around 2lbs)The sound is not that great either, sounds like a boom box that you can't adjust the bass on.The good:Its easy to setup the right time and it has nature sounds..thats about itAll in all I would NOT recommend this to anyone for this price. You can find something better"
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"For the price, this is not a bad clock radio. It is a good looking unit and the sound is pretty good (not great).Nature sounds are quite good. An optional remote control can be purchased for $20.Overall, I would say the cons outweigh the pros. I agree with the other reviewers that the FM reception is bad. There is also a problem no one has mentioned. The digital clock has a narrow viewing angle much like the old projection televisions. It is impossible to read the time unless you are within 15 feet or so and the clock is within a few degrees of your eye level. This is a problem if you are in bed and the unit is placed on a nightstand that is above or below the top of the bed. I have never seen this before in a digital clock radio. Dimming the display exacerbates the problem.UPDATE - Stopped working after 3 months. I would definitely not buy this item again. All around a very disappointing product. Save your money"
2,should have just bought a sound machine,"When I saw this item last year, I asked for it for Christmas. I opened it right away and couldn't wait to use it. I am a person who likes the fan on year round for the noise and thought this alarm clock would be great for background noise, as an alarm clock, and to listen to my ipod...well, I do not put my ipod in it (bought small speakers that travel for that) and the clock was not good for me because the blue light is too strong-even on the low level. I keep it on all ight on ocean sounds and really like that."
2,beware,"It records but doesn't playback video with audio on your Pocket PC (you have to play it back by transfering it to your big PC), though you have to read the manual very carefully to find that out.It claims to record video at 30 per sec. but it's more like 8-10 frames, and I have a 400 processor."
3,A review,"Alph is set in a futuristic, woman only world. When the first male baby in 500 years is created by cloning, the entire society structure is in for a shake.Charles Eric Maine makes a reasonable effort with this rather inplausible premise. The book is an easy read (its short, and that helps). An OK, but not really thrilling reading.On the negative side, the viewpoint is set rather distant from the characters, more concerned with describing the society than the characters that populate it. As a result,no real interesting characters emerge. Even the titular Alph doesnt show until the last chapters. Characters are little more than devices to explain society's innerworkingsA couple of somewhat amusing cases of bad technical forecasting appear, but I am not sure how off they were in 1972, when the book was written.The finale is not that suprising (gee, we have this opressive, Orwellian, individuality-neutralizing society, I wonder what is going to happen)Recommended as light SF reading."
2,Not the Smyth you might know and love.,"While I am finding this helpful to look through for an overview of Greek grammar, I would like to echo another reviewer: This is not the edition that the rest of the academic world references. Unfortunately, this significantly curtails this volume's potential to be a reference work on my bookshelf. While this version still will be useful in its own ways, I would recommend getting the Harvard UPress version."
4,Comprehensive but totally overwhelming,"Since most of you are probably required to buy this for class like me, this review may not be the most useful. But anyone thinking of buying this should know that it has every possible bit of information about Ancient Greek--and every tidbit, every little comment, is numbered. This means the student ends up reading a chapter, say, on verb stems, and reading numbers 1024 to 1112. Since the data is so organized, you'd think it's an easy reference, but no. If you're looking for something specific, it'll take some wading through numbers and symbols. Whatever you want is definitely in there--it just might take some time to find it."
3,Classic Mix,"its a good mix, got it for living legends track. I play it constantly, definitely would recommend it to everyone."
4,"Green & Gold slams, shows the power of L.A. Hip Hop.","The Anonymous is a fat cd, the beats are unique and the vocals likewise. It is excellent to see the ability on emcee has on the mic. Hip Hop forever."
4,cool fantastic 1 and 2 are cool and fantastic,"eminem is a digrace to any album stating... ""all praises due to the most high""...he and most of the other mc's are not representing the most high... i'm dissapointed but, dr. ez's two versions of cool fantastic make it worthy of the price... bottom line... JESUS is LORD"
4,"Does work, Sometimes cuts out","i have bought this for my psp 3000, it does charge it while its on and while its doing things. it is a good product, but sometimes the charger light blinks like its not charging. it charges good, but somtimes cuts out. worth the 2 bucks or so."
1,The cable has problems.,"I noticed this cable works for others but after buying two of them, my computer has problems talking to the PSP with this cable. The charge function seems to work, but I suspect that the cable length is a problem, and/or shielding is just substandard. I won't get a connection at all, or the computer will detect the PSP but fail to communicate and give me an error message. Maybe 1 in 10 tries can I get the cable to really work.The only way I can talk to my PSP reliably is using a very short cable that came with my music player. Using this the PSP immediately is seen by my computer and I can back up my files.There is a option to turn off the charge function though the PSP to help with a connection, but after trying it the connection still would not work until I choose the really short cable.It could be a just have a really picky computer but I am SOL when I try and use these cables."
4,"The cable works as expected, nothing more or less.",Was happy to see that there is plenty of length in the USB and DC leads to support simultaneous connectivity when desired.

4,Good Resource,"I haven't gone through this book thoroughly yet, but it is a suggested reading from my professor for a Gifted Master's program."
2,Disappointing,"In order for the kids to find the hidden toy using the wands, you basically have to hide the toy in the room they're in. The signal is not strong enough to pick up the toy from very far away. This is fun for about 5 minutes and sort of defeats the purpose of keeping the kids entertained. The batteries also run down fairly quickly, and a strong battery signal is what is needed most. Overall, very disappointing."
3,An intriguing beginning with a predictable finish,"Loved the beginning of the book, but the past tense narrative as I work my way through it allowed me to easily guess the ending long before I finished. Half way through the story, it appears the author grows weary of writing it, or perplexed as to how to finish, and just sort of wraps it up."
