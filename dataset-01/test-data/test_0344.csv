1,How can we begin to believe those who exaggerate?,"Actual footage rearranged in a way that deviates from a real timeline. Michael Moore speaks over this footage and gives his opinions. He does not support them with facts. The aim of this ""movie"" is to infuriate, not eduacate the masses. This film has no intellectual value except a study on current propoganda."
1,Not a documentary,"Michael Moore released this film to make more money for himself. If you want to see the truth, watch Celcius 41.11, which is available for free. If Michael Moore was truly just trying to get his message out, why do you have to pay for it? I watched Celcius 41.11 and the videos by the Swift Boat veterans because they were available for no cost. They also told the truth. Cable news is the only way to go. Shame on CBS and people like Michael Moore that distort the truth for their own selfish gains. I have not watched this movie because I will not pay to watch it and have Michael Moore profit from it."
1,Bad Fiction,"If you like fiction, how someone can edit and manipulate interviews to present his view, rahter than the person he interviewed, this movie is for you. Luckily, I never spent a dime to watch this movie; I went to the cinema, paid for a different movie, but walked into the one showing this movie, and only because so many Bush-haters talked about it. It really is a movie for people who hate Bush [...], people who want to believe (regardless of facts) all of Bush's doings being wrong. Apparently, the movie did not help Kerry win the election. Fortunately, many Americans realized what Bush is doing, is right. I am a Democrat, but after 9/11 I voted for Bush. If you like to watch a really good DVD, have a look at FahrenHYPE 9/11, the movie shows all the lies of Michael Moore."
1,For His Next Earth Shattering Revelation,Oh im so excited about Mikes next project. He is going to tell us all about how the holocaust never happened and Hitler was just protecting his fatherland from the evil Jewish invaders.
1,Don't Bother...,"I heard a joke about Michael Moore. I heard that he saw the movie/documentary 'Supersize Me' and kicked himself for not filming his last 300 trips to McDonalds.This film is put together well and has interesting footage that is worth seeing, but the propaganda it spews is just sickening. If you're a liberal you'll love it. If you're a conservative you'll hate it. If you don't care about politics, you'll probably be bored.You did know that the whole purpose of this film was to convince you to vote Kerry, right? And if you saw it in theatres, well, you paid upwards of eight bucks to see a prolonged mudslinging fest that up until now only viewers of television campaign ads had to put up with.Do yourself a favor and don't pay twenty bucks for the DVD."
1,Moore the Manipulator,"Regardless of how I feel about anything Moore does, the political situation or anything else that people want to heap on top of tis film, it is the work of a masterful manipulator. The only point I am going to bring up is his film shot in Walter Reed Hospital. He manipulated the film shot there of actual war casualties who had body parts amputated to make it seem that they were against the war. In several interviews post Farenheit 9/11's debut these people in Walter Reed have been disgusted that they were used by Moore to further his own propaganda when they were proud of what they had accomplished over there and would have done it again. Moore is a Manipulator of information and that is all."
1,I hate you Michael Moore,Bush rocks and you stink.I never saw this movie and I`ll never plan to because I hate Michael Moore and someday they should have a docrementry about him being a moron because he is one.
1,Move over Dr. Goebbels....,"Michael Moore conjures lies and deceit. He appeals to people's base feelings of envy, revenge, conceit, and arrogance. THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN MICHAEL MOORE WILL COLLAPSE UNDER HIS OWN WEIGHT , AND TRUTH WILL AGAIN TRIUMPH !"
1,"WATCH MOVIE, BUT VOTE FOR AMERICA'S SAFETY AND SECURITY!!!!!","Dear Americans! Sure you can watch this movie and this is America all about - freedom of choice and liberty to watch whatever you want to see, but in a week from now, don't stay at home and go and vote for the safety of your freeland! Please, please do not let the enemies abroad and inside to laugh at you and mock at you. This is this movie made for! The whole world is watching as America is to vote and vote not just for George Bush, but for the safety and security of this wonderful and God Blessed country! This movie would not be applauded by the Founding fathers especially at the eve of election! Think about this! God Bless the USA! Watch, but vote for America!!!!!!!"
3,"strange, how the world revolves","yes, michael moore is contreversial. but what is his goal ? has anyone who has seen one of his movies ever noticed the cut and paste method of his editing processes, so that when a question on the narrative is asked, different parts of the interview are used to answer his question ? if his initial plan is to get people to research political material on their own terms, then by all means, he has succeeded. [...]"
1,Movie Sucked,Saw it and wsa exactly what I thought it would be... A distorted half truth that blind democrats go see... and suprisingly believe but have not facts besides what Michael Moore tells them...
1,Michael Moore Hates America,"Liberal Propangandistic Lies ... The worst part is that so many people in our country are so uninformed, they will believe this propaganda film. God Bless America and President George W. Bush."
1,Farenlies 9/11.,"I urge people to read this review on the movie, Farenheit 9/11. http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/ -- titled the lies of Michael Moore. This was a MSN.com article (obviously).Bush has over a 55% approval rating in the country for a reason -- he is a great commander-in-chief in my opinion. The way Moore depicts Iraq as nothing but peaceful to the world and it's citizens truly does sicken me.The way he also says the election would've been won if recounted again no matter what for Gore in the beginning of the movie was completely false... along with how he accuses of Bush going to war just to please his former business associates.55% of the American people trust Bush and approve of what he's done, and I'm one of them. I saw this movie on opening weekend -- and it is simply false. The only good documentary Michael Moore ever did was Roger & Me... other than that he seems to like to lie a lot to promote his socialist agenda."
5,See this movie,"No matter what side of the ""asile"" you're on, see this movie. No matter where you stand on politics, the media, the war, the economy, social justice issues, whatever, SEE THIS MOVIE.That's all, folks."
1,You Must Be Kidding........,"Absolute tripe......If you are close to being brain dead and know nothing of actual world affairs, you can probably be swayed by this movie. If you are an independent thinker, and are educated in world affairs and politics, you will see this for what it is..........an ultra-left wing money-maker for Michael Moore. Pass on this one."
2,Documentary? Not really,"The problem with calling it a documentary is it's mostly conjecture and spin. This film is 90 percent fiction.If you want to use this film as a barometer of today's political climate, keep in mind; this film comes from farther than extreme left, and Hollywood is a fantasy world. Don't buy into it, IT'S FICTION!!!"
2,We Were Deceived,"I saw this movie on opening day. Already opposed to the war in Iraq, and displeased with President Bush's foreign policy in general, I found the movie effective and convincing. That Monday I recommended the movie to friends and family.I was eager to see what the movie's effect on popular culture would be, and read all I could about it on the Internet and in the media, leading me to Michael Isikoff's devastating critique of the movie in Newsweek, and Christopher Hitchens scathing review on Slate.com. Neither of these men are big Bush lovers.I spent the subsequent week researching their claims, and find their info to be much more accurate. Despite being more politically aligned with Mr. Moore than his detractors, I now believe that he purposely misled his audience in several sections of the movie.Deception is not an effective way to win people to our point of view, and despite Mr. Moore's success as a filmmaker, I don't think he is doing any good for the cause."
1,More Fraud about Moore's Fraud,"The People's Choice Awards were this past week and, somehow, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 ""won"" an award for Favorite Film or something.One question: how could the 16th highest-grossing film of 2004 get voted as the best film of the year?(News stories abound about how this is the first year that voting for these awards was changed to Internet voting, a system obviously rife with corruption).Even the people I know who rabidly defended this thoroughly-discredited ""documentary"" have turned squeamish about Moore's obnoxious methods and arrogant attitude.You'd have to go back to Nazi Germany to find an equal when it comes to propaganda."
5,A Must See For Every American,"All I can say about this movie is Buy this one and watch it witheveryone you know.The Country you save may be your own, and we need to get Mr.Bush and his buddys out of office.......and maybe even send them toJail ......"
1,"Garbage, senseless garbage","Anybody who actually wastes their time seeing this film should realize after watching it just how stupid and petty it really is. I am sorry that Michael Moore calls himself an American. He is a bon-bon eating bleeding heart liberal who needs to wake up and shut up. It is interesting how much Moore wants to get the ""facts"" to the American people right before Election Day. The documentary is just as the filmmaker is, garbage."
1,Bias attempting to pass itself off as documentary,"While I can tolerate that Michael Moore has to right to express his opinion, I find it incredibly unethical for him to call this film a documentary. A documentary is typically made to be as objective as possible. In particular, you would not find many honest filmmakers intentionally including misleading films clips in a documentary. The only thing Moore documents is how fanatical he and others are with their hatred of Bush and his administration. Their treatment of this medium says more about them than it does about the president."
1,Crap,This movie is nothing but fiction and trys discredit George Bush. Don't waste your time or money.
1,One Star Too Many,"See it with a barf bag...pure, factless fantasy!The only reason to give this film any star at all is for the producer's vivid imagination...he would have done well during the McCarthy era. If you have more than two I.Q. points to rub together don't waste your time with this drivel!Anyone remember that this country was savagely, mercilessly attacked by foreign elements on 9/11? These elements don't want to kill Liberals or Conservatives, Republicans or Democrats but Americans! Somebody out there better ""get it"" soon or the economy and all the rest of it simply won't be around to matter...and Mr. Moore won't be making any more Taliban films."
3,Opinion & Fact,"I personally think that this movie was taken out of context. It may have something that were true, but we as people don't know what really goes on in the White House, and we dont see everything, and if we did this world would probably be worse then It already was, because there thins that we just dont need to know. Since we live in a world of free speech that's all Michael Moore was doing, but that doesnt mean that everything he said was true. Thats just how I feel about it. We have to look at boths sides ot just one and judge someone off of someones opinions."
1,Toby Keith for liberals...,"Just make sure if you see this movie, which does make some interesting points, (particularly the segment about how fear has affected our society,) to go rent or buy FAHRENHYPE 9/11 immediately afterwards...it will clear up all the ""questions"" Michael Moore asks during this propaganda ridden piece of trash.The most disturbing thing about this film is how every quote and interview has been twisted around and cut-up to suit the directors' left-wing agenda. Also, after all of his criticism of Bush, corporate society, etc shown here, where are Michael Moore's profits from this thing going?I heard somewhere that this film was actually shown in a classroom! Talk about scary. Think Michael Moore is the only Hollywood bozo involved with the Bush-bashing? Think again. Go pick up any recent issue of Rolling Stone and you'll see the same garbage. I am by no means a right-wing lunatic, but come on! This crap is just so trendy. Think for yourself people."
1,"Bush won, Moore is rich, and you wasted 2hours","There is a simple test to determine whether someone is to be taken seriously regarding this film. If they call it a ""great film"" or an ""intriguing documentary,"" then they are clearly incapable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality.This is a political attack. The truth, through an endless series of out-of-context shots and deceitful editing, is brushed aside for the most part. What this film is not, most definitely, is a documentary. Of course within the propaganda are ""real"" video clips, but without context they mean very little. It is, however, a megaphonic display of first amendment rights. God bless America - where else can you defame the President so overtly and be completely protected doing so."
5,Check the Facts,"Although some of this is spun, as opinions tend to be, check the facts he presents. (he's good about stating if something is proven fact, statistical fact, or quoted) I did. The first 10 minutes are compelling enough. This film is chilling and blatant and worth the watch. Intelligent, ""open minded"" will get it. The others won't. (And I'm not saying you have to agree with it to get it)The film also showcases the power of the ""right,"" and how history repeats itself. The ignorant, if numerous enough, CAN achieve greatness. Moore attempts to expose ignorance, but I fear is preaching to the choir here. Those who NEED to understand, will justify, rationalize and when that doesn't work, just DENY the facts. Watch it if you dare.I'm not a Moore fan, but this film should make you think. Or, maybe not."
1,"Liar, liar, liar!","Nice try Michael Moore! ""There's no terrorist threat! We've been attacked, but that doesn't mean that there's a terrorist threat."" As if any intellegent human beings actutally believe that! Skip both Bowling for Columbine and this movie as they're both packed with Michael's lies. Watch something fun and exciting like the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD's. They're a heck of a lot more interesting the Moore's lies about the Republican party are."
1,"Used to love Moore... now, not so much...","Used to love Michael Moore and his books/movies, now I'm ashamed. Too bad most of the points in this movie were proven incorrect by the bipartisan 9-11 Commission report and the Senate Intellegence Committee and British security report that vindicated Tony Blair. This is far from a ""documentary"", as Moore twists the truth to his liking (ie. the misrepresented and inaccurate newspaper editorial date and headline and the bit about encouraging Congressmens' children to enlist...he cut out the one rep who wanted to help him, because his kid was in Iraq...he was a Republican).Despite the errors, it'll win an Oscar, because that's the way Hollywood is..."
1,The Man without a country,"Number one, drop any idea that this is a factual account of 9/11. moore is probably the holder for the most lies told in one film. If you treat it as a piece of fiction, it is still unviewable. I kept saying to myself - where on earth did he get his supposed facts? I gave up and decided that this film should be relegated to the trash heap and never see the light of day in my house. Words fail me at the disgust I feel for this man and hence the title of my review. He is not an American, I don't know what he or it is. I cannot begin to list the outright prevarications in the film."
1,Propaganda Propaganda Propaganda,"Sadly most people will see this and go, ""Oh Bush is horrible, how could I have been so blind?"" But have you ever seen Moore(on) go on any show to debate what he tells his audience to be true? No most will just accept what he says to be the gospel."
1,Insult to all Veterans,"Once again, Michael Moore has used his video editing skills in an attempt get his anti-American sentiment to the public. As a proud Veteran, I am insulted by this ""documentary"" and would hope any true American would see through his lies and propganda."
3,"Please remember, Mr. Moore is a film director!","This is just another Bush bashing film. Lots of prophaganda(sp?), most of it is just sqeud slightly to give for great entertainment values. I have acutally watched farrenHYPE 9/11, another prophaganda film, IMO, it's all pro-Bush, pro-War, etc. I think that both are just alluring you to be on one side of the fence or the other. Both try to take the work of tring to think yourself. As I heard on the beginning of the Tool cd on the video collection, ""Think forself, question authority."" Who knows what really is going on, only the people involved know. Until you get a unbiased opionin about anything, then don't go parading your judgement around. Also, Bush isn't as any worse a President as any other in the past, he just seems to be bad at being miscevious(sp?) about it. There's always a hand in the cookie jar, no matter who is in office. But if you are a Bush basher, then this is the film for you."
2,What happened to Michael Moore the cheerful agitator?,"How can the man who made ""Roger and Me"", a thought-provoking, educational, serious, sad yet entertaining piece which represented some of the best of American documentary-making turn out such a rambling, nonsensical hot mess?I only give it two stars for its stunning opening - the awful sounds of 9/11 with no picture. That was ""movie magic"" - one of those utterly gripping screen moments which grabs you by the throat.I suppose the greatest disppointment was...well...everthing after that opening scene. It could have been a compelling story...only the narrative hops around as if on a broken trampoline...tries too hard to do discredit the Bush administration, barely focuses on the back story (""Charlie Wilson's war""; the rise of the Taliban, the history of Al Qaeda, America's love-hate relationship with Saddam Hussein) and never once attempts to explain the mindsets of the hijackers.Moore should be ashamed of himself...I know I am ashamed for him."
1,Fahrenheit 9/11 Movie Review,"Okay..here i go...this movie had to be the most boring documentary Michael Moore has ever done...Personally, I would not reccomned sitting through this 2 hour film of Bush Bashing...Now i don't support president bush, however it was nonsense..There are two sides to every story and to get his point across he only showed the side that involved negativity towards bush...Long boring movie it is shown in short little news clips through the whole thing...sound good to you now?"
1,Pure Trash,"This guy is so full of himself it's sick. He makes stuff up just to get more people to see his pieces of crap so he can buy more Big Macs and stuff them down his lying mouth. The day this guy is ""silenced"" the better."
3,Let's see the movie first,"Whether you like Mr. Moore or not, I strongly recommend to see this film. Mr. Moore has a right to express his view and it might be worth to see his points of view. He seems to be filled up with the hatred for President Bush, but it does not mean he hates United States as well. If you cannot see the difference between him and the terrorists, I have to say you are blinded. Patriotism is not about supporting every action the government takes nor bashing people who are critical of the administration. If no one questions, we end up living in a country with no freedom. Before condoning or condemning, let's watch this film. Shall we?"
1,Moore is a liar.,Moore is making money off of September 11th. This is also not his first movie to distort the facts.www.bowlingfortruth.com
2,No pocket clip,"Product description reads ""Easy to read sliding pocket clip for depth and height"" but there is no pocket clip anywhere. Without it I have little use for the 305ME ruler."
1,Jack Rudman Office Management/Exec Assistant,"These books are no good. I was extremely unhappy when I received these books. Rudman's books look like they were typed before computers were introduced. If you are looking for certifications IAAP has certifications that are much better than this and more up to date, plus they are world known."
3,Cute speakers,"I bought them for a gift and thought they were very cute. The sound quality is o.k, nothing special, but decent. Sometimes there is a little bit of static, but you can adjust with the volume or balance. Overall it is a pretty nice gift to give to cheer someone up. Not as furry as I expected though.."
3,The Literary Version of the Andy Griffith Show,"This book is poignant, full of truisms both happy and sad, and populated with an eclectic cast of characters. However, the solid writing can't make up for the fact that this tale of Middle America is as wholesome, and bland, as apple pie. It is a quiet, meandering story, which never takes off or heats up. It is much like the Midwest full of small eccentricities which, though sometimes funny, are not enough to rock your world, if you are used to likes of writers like Melville, Selby, Dostoyevsky, Robert Stone, and other visionary madmen who are not satisfied with a good yarn well told. In other words, it's literary vanilla. Not genius, just craft."
4,a comment,"I remember watching 'Roseanne' back in the 80s! I loved the show. The first 3 or 4 seasons were the best before fame got to Roseanne's head and before the new Becky came along. If you like this show, you'll like the first season the best. The kids were cute and you didn't know that they really didn't know how to act."
5,A BIG FAN OF ROSSANE!,i love this show its so halarious.it stars rosanne whoplays the sitcom mother of 3 kids beckythe teenager! dj thelittle kid no one could understand!and darline the hilariousgoth.my dad thinks this show is inanproprete but kidslove it!
5,DONT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY ITS EDITED!,People are saying the show is edited and it isnt worth buying on DVD they must have been born @ss backwards because i watched my tpes after i heard this and its a lie. I am the biggest Roseanne fan on the planet! Buy the DVD so the release all of them..
1,Edited? Not Worth A Single Penny,"What a cheap release. ""Roseanne"" is the number one show I've waited many years to own, like other fans. Everytime I watched one in reruns, I would say ""I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can see all the cut out footage!"" Well, guess what. That's not happening, so I'm not buying the set.I was so excited to spend lots of money collecting the show but it looks like I now have one less thing to do.All these one star reviews on page one should be enough to stop unsuspecting customers from blowing their cash on this cheap mess."
1,Was planning on purchasing this until...,"... I read about the edited episodes. Sorry to the person that requested that people not write in to complain about this but maybe if the right people see how many sales they are losing, this will stop happening.Yes, the series itself is a good one! It was definitely on my 'buy' list but unfortunately no longer. Same goes for 3rd Rock and Cosby. There is no good excuse for this. I'm suspicious it's their way of trying to milk us even more in the future. Can you see it in a few years? ""Roseanne Season One -first time ever with unedited episodes""!!! As consumers, we need to show them we're getting wise to these tricks."
1,Censoring TV???,What is the point of releasing a show with a couple minutes missing from each episode? Hmmm lets think. The industry likes to release dvds multiple times with a little more content on each release. This is just another sick greedy scam from the industry that brought us 3 versions of avatar in 6 months. Just going to have to stop buying dvds when they first come out until they can be verified. Sad but you just cant trust the entertainment industry as far as you can throw it. If they get their way we will all by buying every dvd 3 or 4 times before we get all the content. THIS HAS TO STOP.
1,Note To Those Who Say We Shouldn't Complain,"To those who say we shouldn't boycott this DVD, shouldn't complain, should just take what they give us:The Cosby Show will not have an edited release ever again. Because of all the complaints, and sales that weren't as great as expected, they will use the ORIGINAL, UNCUT NETWORK PRINTS for seasons 2-8.I want the same for Roseanne, and buying this DVD, and saying ""Who cares"" about the edits, is not going to get us what we want."
2,LOVE the show - HATE the editing.,"Syndicated cuts make this NOT a ""complete season"".It's still funny, but it's only worth 90% of the price you pay. Even if it's $9.99, it's still worth only $8.99.Shame."
1,This Is Getting a Little Rediculous,"You people keep stating that This Release is great but it's not, alot of people don't know what the orinal airings are like the edited versions run about 21 minutes and the original airings were 24+ minutes thats atleast 3 minutes and no they don't play during the end credits those scenes were part of original episode as well they are known as tags... and I keep here people say deal with it if your are true fan, well your not a true fan If you can care less about 3 minutes taken off, The Whole taken out of Sydinaction scare tactic doesn't do anything if Viacom (owners of N@N and TV Land) is Smart then after they loose it on N@N they get it for TV Land which they can do after it is out of syndication in 2012 so wait for season 2 if its unedited then buy this dvd if not just watch every day on N@N Oxygen, Locals and others, This is a waste of money even if you are a true roseanne fan which I Most certainly am...."
1,ROseanne is a great show but...,I will not buy this dvd release if it is the same cut version I can watch on TV everyday! What a disrespect for the fans! Too bad for the people releasing this set. They could have made a lot more money than what they are going to on it according to the...125 reviews in just a few days!
1,One of the Greatest TV Shows of All Time Come To DVD,This is one of the greatest TV shows of all time and it comes to DVD along with The Cosby Show (Another trimmed Great) in its syndicated versions. The company responsible gives us the 21 minute versions not the 24. That 3 minutes of time dosen't sound like much but it can make a difference.
3,Magnolia (CRDVD108)is Showboat (Whale-1936) English w/ Portuguese subtitles,"Despite Brazilian release (spine #:CRDVD108)name Magnolia and Portuguese packaging this is a ""passable"" copy of Whales 1936 Showboat. Audio is the original English! Only Portuguese subtitles have been added. Quality is a bit of disappointment title appears to be grainy and has ""NO"" evidence of restoration. Note this dvd has ""no"" area coding and is NTSC Format! Never the less it is one of James Whale best productions is very enjoyable as such."
5,"Covering mealtime, playtime, telephone, school, and health","Look Mom! I Have Good Manners is an interactive and educational 30-minute DVD from Thinkeroo and especially helpful for teaching young children about the basic manners that help people of all ages get along with each other. Covering the five major categories of mealtime, playtime, telephone, school, and health, this fundamental instructional emphasizes kindness, respect, and simple common sense. Also available in a VHS video format, Look Mom! I Have Good Manners is commended to family, school, and community library collections as a superbly produced, completely upbeat, and accessibly useful viewing experience to share with children preschool through kindergarten."
5,OUTSTANDING VIOLINES MAGICOS DE VILLAFONTANA,"This is an excellent collection of instrumentals from around the world, very well excecuted by Maestro Roberto Perez Vasquez where piano and violins take turns to change the tempo and create a musical climax with every rendition. This is an outstanding selection that it is worth having it and playing all the time. There is over 140 minutes of very enjoyable music. I'm buying my second box (The first one I gave it to a dear friend who really appreciates good music)."
3,Just the basics,"I picked this book up as it was eligible for the 4 for 3 promotion. It covers the basics well, but doesn't go into as many specifics as I would like. If you have any real interest, you will quickly be through this book and looking for more detailed information. I suggest ""The Backpacker's Field Manual"" by Rick Curtis instead, as it is much more detailed and wont leave you unfulfilled."
1,this staple gun is useless it does not drive the staple wire all the way to the plastic it leaves 1/16 inch distance space the,this staple gun is useless it does not drive the staple wire all the way to the plastic it leaves 1/16 inch distance space the cable is not secured tight like the stanley t-59 model
5,Arrow T59 Stapler,"This stapler works great. I used it for installation of cat5e cable in my attic and it made the running of the cable so much easier. I've run cable in attics before using nail type brackets, a real pain in the ""..."". This just makes life so much easier."
4,Gilligan,This was a cheap purchase but a goodie. It really was a great show and I've thoroughly enjoying watching the episodes again as an adult.
5,"""Thanks a lot, Gilligan...""","After all these years, Gilligan's Island is still silly, outrageous and enjoyable. The second season is probably the best, too bad this show only ran for three seasons but who knew this little show would go on to delight new fans for over 40 years! This show is pure fun, one of my favorite guilty pleasures of all-time. Don't wait, get all three seasons today!"
5,Better than season one!,"I've just finished watching the first side of disk one(there are three two sided disks just as in season one.) which contains the first six episodes of season two plus creator Sherwood Schwartz commentating on the episode ""The Little Dictator"". The color is fantastic as is the sound. The picture is so clear that you'd swear you were watching the shows in their original run. Much clearer and much more colorful than the syndicated television versions, and best of all, UNEDITED! syndication chops off probably 5 to 8 minutes of each episode. Unfortuneatley, there isn't much for bonus features, but just having each episode unedited in great color and clarity is more than enough, with a great price to boot."
5,Gilligan's Island,"I always enjoyed Gilligan's Island as a child. Now I can bring that enjoyment to my own children. With all the rubbish on Australian television that is on at unsuitable times e.g. 7.30pm. Gilligan's Island is very funny with clean humour, something of a rarity these days. Australian television stations do not have any morals and do not cater to childrens' needs. I highly recommend Gilligan's Island for the very young to the very old. F.T. Victoria Australia"
2,Few High Points But Too Many Low!!,"I have alway's been a fan of Erasure, and have alway's thought that Andy Bell was gifted with that wonderful voice. I have to say that I found this Album a bit of a let down. Same great voice, but the tracks do not do him any justice. I understand that this is a dance/club album. But I think it would be nice for a change for him to do a album that focuses on that great voice and the lyric a little more. I think Crazy is the high point of the album. But most of the rest of the tracks fall flat. I saw the Erasure tour last year, and thought Andy had develpoed as a singer, performer, and person. He had so much soul and style in every lyric. I also enjoyed the Erasure Night Bird Album. I just don't think this is his best work. Worth a listen though."
4,Engligh China and its Marks,I found this book interresting and will enjoy it for a long time. It had many of the marks I had been looking for info. on.NR in IOWA
5,SCREWS,It is a tight spot to get into my sewing machine screws and this works great.GOT MY DAUGHTER IN LAW ONE ALSO
5,Great for precision work,"I use them for keying locks, they work great for picking up and installing the tiny pins in locks. I find that the offset angle works best for this type of work."
4,"Visually stunning, but...","...as with the other volumes published thus far about the Ghysels collection (World of Rings, Splendor of Ethnic Jewelry), one is left thirsting for an accompanying volume of scholarship. Broad introductions to the regions represented and short captions relegated to the end of the book are what we're given instead, often without dates for the pieces shown. A gorgeous and inspiring visual resource- still one of my favorites on ethnic jewelry, for the sheer beauty of the pieces included- but a bit frustrating to the jewelry historian."
3,The outlet covers pop out regularly,"It's a power cord. Only drawback is the little plastic outlet covers always pop out when removing a plug. Other than that, no problems."
3,not impressed,"I bought this depth gauge, to replace the one that is included in this setPromax 79057 Measuring Tool Set, 6-Piece. Well, that's not going to happen. These tools need to be easy to make small, incremental changes and they should be accurate and easy to read and use.The General Tools depth gauge is not a smooth and easy to operate, as the one it was supposed to replace. Maybe I got a bad one, but it is rather a disappointement, considering that it costs almost as much as the entire Promax tool set linked above....."
2,I can agree with most everyone in here,"My faucet came with the house, back in 2007 and worked wonderfully up until the day before yesterday... Out of nowhere, as I am using the faucet/sprayer, with water ""full stream ahead"" the hose falls off of the wand.... Water is shooting everywhere and the hose gets tightly lodged down into the hub assembly... I have spent the last day and a half trying to pull it out with needle nosed pliers and it won't budge... Not even able to push it up from underneath the sink. I then attempt to go at it from a different direction... By removing the handle, the cap, valve assembly, etc... That was an impossible task. I have now given up and am heading out right now to buy a new faucet and it sure as hell won't be another Delta. All I can say, is I have learned a lot, being a single female/homeowner. I will be replacing this faucet all by myself and have NO FEAR of doing so."
4,It's a Faucet,"Fairly easy install. No plumber needed for me. Looks nice and just works. My one complaint is the head feels a little cheap and flimsy. The button to change from stream to spray also seems somewhat cheaply made. I did not realize it is a slide, I would have liked a button to press and hold to spray. I have to get used to where I put my hands to move the faucet back and forth- I am always touching the button by accident!"
1,Gates is confused.,"Shown throughout his book and video, Gates does not in any way understand the Afrikan experience, he blames Afrikan people for their past and as another reviewer stated the questions that he did ask were upsetting to the people and plainly 'stupid', his trip to Afrika was a waste of money, time and channel thirteen's airtime. I disagree, no black or white person should read his book or see his video, he is an Afrikan-American man with Afrikan ancestors and has totally forgotten this and has adapted to the 'hole' European world and its views."
1,Pretty Weak Tips,"I'd have to agree with the denigrators and I'm basically a novice. You could save the $30 and just goof around with the program for a couple of weeks and you'd have most of what's in here under your belt. Annoying editorial voice that thinks it's much more clever than it really is to boot. It would be a good book for the toilet in a design studio, however. Which is where I suspect the majority of copies will wind up."
5,Awesome product,"I have no idea what the ""Patrick"" is thinking... But if you read his other reviews, he only gives one star. He's sounds like a bitter customer, not just for this product.Well I have one and it works awesomely. Bubbles? Huh.... I had to write a review because the last review was so inaccurate. These things work, period!"
2,Professor teaches software tutorial,"Personaly, I found this a rather boring way to learn. Maybe if you don't have any idea of how to use MS office at all it is more helpful. I look forward to receiving the Mavis Beacon 2007 software for office instead. I know that the Mavis Beacon typing software was how I had taught myself to type years ago. There is a lot of activity going on with Mavis Beacon.Linda"
5,Fresh and tasty Cayenne Pepper - generous amount and good value,"As other reviewers have mentioned, cayenne pepper is also good to deter animals from getting into certain places. It has been good for cats, and smaller dogs, not so much for my curious Labrador who will smell and eat anything.This Tone's Ground Cayenne Pepper is a great for my cooking needs. The cayenne pepper is fresh, tasty, and has good value for the price."
3,review,this item is cute and compliments my collection but it came to me with a brown stain on it's butt and other flecks of dirt through out it's fur. Seller offered to take it back if i paid the shipping but to pay shipping both ways was more than the cost of the lamb. I kept it.
4,People Know When I Walk in the Room I am a Rock'n'Roller,"This record was released in 1981, right before the wheels came off in Joe's life. Living on the edge of colapse financially and from drug abuse, the overall production shows it. Not necessarily a bad thing if you like kick-ass rock'n'roll. Joe plays with the anger displayed on his first solo release,""LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING"", but the songs are better. While Mr.Perry's guitar is screaming, with a fire it has rarely shown since, Charlie Farren's vocals are better than any on Joe's first disc. However, the record misses something. Few can come close to Steven Tyler's vocal presence for that kind of balls to the wall bluesy rock'n'roll. In my opinion, it still isn't quite an Aerosmith record. Though, for songwriting and as fiery a guitar preformance as you'll hear from Joe on a studio disc, this is Joe Perry's best album as a solo artist."
3,Laughed Out Loud (Been There!) ... But Something's Missing!,"Much of the philosophy rings true. The male ego and ""eye"" has no bounds, nor shame. However, trust and sharing (especially fantasies) is a huge part of a successful marriage. The authors spend too much time on the downside of the relationship between men & women and devote only one chapter to the upside -- not a balanced viewpoint."
1,Don't waste your money.,Pathetic book ... makes all men seem like sex-obsessed perverts and low-lifes. Not all men are like they say and my husband is living proof of that. Any woman that reads this book and takes it to heart will end up celebate for the rest of her life. Don't waste your time or money.
3,What Women Don't Want Men to Know,"Entertaining but puleez. At one point the authors assert that women only fantasize about their partners while men will fantasize about other women, celebrities etc. Guess what guys? Women fantasize all the time about gorgeous movie starst etc. Did you ever think that is why lots of women like the lights out? And, maybe if you knew how much we fantasize you would take care of your appearance the way we do!On another topic, I hated the fonts etc. used to make points. Let's just use one font and maybe some bolding. It gave me a headache.Even though it is not so great when it tries to portray women - it was not half bad in describing the strong sex drives of men. THere is some reality there."
5,Far too good to be labeled psychological.,"This text captapults the understanding of certain spiritual experiences into awareness. It discovers, uncovers a rationality to consciuosness without imposing one. And an intellectual depth that gently and elegantly surrounds one in the rich fabric of western culture and its Greek heritage.Examples are care as the source of will, charity as the biblical translation of agape, rebirth of experience as Eros: the king of the daimonics."
1,Boxing gloves,"Not a great product at all and the remote and nunchuck do not fit well, poor quality and frankly unnecessary."
5,My Daughter Loves This Book,My 2-year old daughter loves this book! We've read it every night for the past month and she's still entertained by it. The pages and cover are thick and durable.
2,Jackie,Ramona is kind a brat I really don't like her but this is really good characters and you should read it
3,Cursive,I much prefer teaching cursive from the beginning - but our school used this edition. I prefer the new edition.
5,Flights of Beauty,This blu-ray DVD is everything its title promises. Spectacular aerial video photography of great Alaskan scenery. Technically superb. Love it!
5,Happy Customer,"Great product. I've already gone through an entire roll. I used it to protect my mountain bike from rock chips and cable rub. You have to be patient with the application. I didn't use soapy water like some others. I just fitted it to the area I wanted to protect, then cut to length, then applied slowly by removing the paper backing as I went. Make sure you don't contaminate the adhesive with dirty fingers or anything else, and make sure you get all the air bubbles out of it will not stick as well."
5,Transformative!,"I'm quite happy I got this book. It's really helping when it comes to thinking about painting. I'm not sure I'd recommend it to the absolute beginner or the aged master, but for the main body of struggling painters it should prove a welcome addition to the library. For my part it's helped to build a better framework around painting."
3,Okay Purchase,Some interesting points in this book but overall the techniques and pointers are way above the talent level of a beginning painter like me.
3,problem solving,I am a beginner painter and the book is a little too advanced for the stage that I am at currently. I can really see the benefit of the information when I get a little more experienced.
1,NOT made in USA as pictured!,"I bought this one over the many other selections - and paid more than most - because it clearly showed in the photo that it was ""Made in USA"". No such stamp is on the one I received although it is a General Tools No. 21 US Standard Sheet Metal Round Gage just as listed. Small print on the back of the package shows it was made in India.If I wanted an overseas product, I would have spent 1/3 this amount. Not right."
2,BUT IT DOESN'T SINK THE NAILS !,"C'mon - how can you give this tool a good rating when it doesn't do the job it is supposed to do? Would you give kudos to a vacuum that you had to follow with a broom & dustpan? Yes, it may be easier to use this gun than a hammer BUT how about getting another electric nailer that does what it is supposed to do? I am very annoyed at having bought this without doing any research. I was at the HD and wanted an inexpensive and simple nail driver just for installing those cheap pre-finished baseboards in one room. It wasn't even worth it for that. The reviewer who wrote that the newer model ""corrects"" the problem proves this tool wasn't worth the few bucks I paid for it."
2,Nail Gun,"Although the concept is great, the nail gun just doesn't have enough power to sink the nail even in drywall. It was a waste of time and money for me, and thankfully amazons return policy is very generous because this was of no use for me. Save up a bit more and get a better electric nailer or a compressor/nailer combo kit. I recommend porter cables 3 gun combo compressor set on amazon, great stuff."
5,So what it doesnt sink nails...,"If you putting up molding, baseboards this is the tool, there is a item at Lowes for 2 bucks called a nail sinker that you use with a hammer. the purpose of this item is to nail objects to walls, cabinets and THEN go back and finish sinking the nail in. Don't complain for 25 bucks"
5,Gets better w/ every viewing...,"I too LOVE this film and have just about worn out my videotape. It is understated & priceless. I won't repeat what others have said about it (except that lines from this movie have entered our family lexicon, too, e.g., ""carbon on the valves"" and ""Good DAY, Mrs. Cunliffe""), I mostly wanted to mention Doris Roberts's gem of a part as the housekeeper. She's sly & sexy, and if you'd like to see her some 30 years before Everybody Loves Raymond, rent or buy this. I think this is Walter Mathau's best role, and the marvelous Elaine May is perfect."
2,"Great movie, not a very good digital version.","This wonderful movie has never really been re digitized. The colors in this version are harsh, the sound track is difficult to hear. Until the original is professionally remastered this is best we can get, other than the original VHS."
5,Great for insulation install,Worked great for insulating a 12 x 24 room. Just watch out for your fingers. It goesright through a thumbnail with ease.
2,Could be a great tool.,I use these staplers pretty heavily and am not easy on them. They are not cheap so I should not have to be. The main problem I see is that the spring on the pusher rodgets screwy on you pretty easily. Once it starts to go there is no turning back. WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THE PUSHER ROD MORE ACCESIBLE? They are not cheap and not easy to find. We go through about 2 of these per house we build.
5,The best I've found,"I bought the 22 oz Tones twice before I bought the Durkee (which appears to be unavailable now), and found the Durkee lacking in flavor but with bigger un-flavorful crystals. I like spicy seasoning and this one is the best. Years ago, this was my first intro into a seasoning that could stand on it's own, time after time with no other additions. I add to it now, but if you are looking for a great way to easily improve the taste of your meals, you only need to use this seasoning.Large amounts for meat, chicken and seafood, but smaller amounts, trial and error, for other things. Popcorn - with pecorino romano cheese - it's practically a meal."
4,very salty,"I do like this seasoning, but compared to other cajun seasonings i've tried, it tastes extremely salty to me. Just personal opinion."
2,Very disjointed book.,I found the material in the book very troubling and informative but I felt that the impact was diminished by the multiple authors and the obvious lack of a single editor to give an overall shape and tone to the book.
1,"Tomiki style, sorry I bought it.","Contents: Tomiki style aikido demo. Quite a lot of the first bit was spent on stretching warmups like touching the toes (interminable!), seems like at least half the video consisted of confrontational warmups which were prelude to Tomiki style aikido competition kata. I think they should state clearly on the cover ""TOMIKI AIKIDO."" Just my opinion, wish I could get my money back. :("
1,The Art of Aikido by Dr Lee Ah Loi,"If you are a beginner DONT buy this tape. The sound is of poorquality, The comentary is of poor quality. It is just a pooroverview of Aikido and is NO WAY a guide, or a HOW TO DOAikido. I wasted my $25 investment. I felt cheated."
5,"long but tight, and the ending!",This one shows Bova's direction to get us out of this neighborhood! If you've read his other stuff and know of the 'Artifact' the last chapter or two will really run a chill up your spine.It's long but it takes time to setup the scenario!Wonderful fun!
2,titan,"Not up to the usual standards, keep up with the science fiction and keep politics out of space, one idiot in america is enough , we don't need the same sort of arrogant , cleptimaniac portraying (Bush) in space."
4,very good 1st try,"As far as classical music, im not a expert.But for first try it sounds very good to me.Would like to here more of tonys piano playing in the music."
5,Almost Angels,"Great movie, I can't believe I never heard of it or saw it until I was in my 30's. This movie needs to be more readily available, it is good classic entertainment!"
4,Good product.,"I really like this product and have used it mostly when hikeing/rucking. It is nice and light weight, dries fast when you are not on the move, nice fit on the body. I would recommend this to a friend."
2,File guides,"Very disappointed, These came constructed out of basic card stock with a shiny black finish, which had become tacky and adhered each divider to the next, once carefully pried apart, these dividers were found to be weak, and the finish (which appears to look like sturdy plastic)is nothing but an eyesore stuck on the card either before or after it... Waste of money. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
1,Disappointed,"The real one looks much cheaper than the photo. The design doesn't look genuine, nothing a real FF fan would truly appreciate.Almost impossible to rig correctly."
3,A good reference book for beginners,"I am glad I did not pay full price for this book. It is geared toward women who know little to nothing about beauty products and make up application. It did offer some good reference material and it could have shown more detailed ""how to"" illustrations in the chapters regarding make up application."
5,Well written with lively characters,"Black Harvest by Ann Pilling (1983)I read this book some 20-30 years ago and it still stands vividly in my memory. This presents a different perspective on the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1852) wherein the population of Ireland fell by 20-25%. The children unravel the significance of their experiences and link it to the Great Famine.Also noteworthy: the only book I've read wherein the depiction of a baby is so real and not just a ""cardboard"" cut-out!"
5,Drill gauge,This is a great tool. It rivals tools like this that cost much more. I hope I can get more deals this good.
3,Did I get the wrong one?,"I purchased one of these from a local store a bit more than a year ago. On first use, I was impressed enough to get the baritone/euphonium kit so I could have a stiff brush for tuning slides and valve casings. Last week, I opened up the zip bag I keep this in to clean my outer slide and....why is it too short? Did I get the wrong one? *checks bag* Nope, it says ""Trombone"". Did I grab the euph one? No, they're the same length...The only options left are: 1) They changed the length at some point and now it can be used as depicted in the product photo, and 2) I'm completely nuts and need to seek help.I'm leaning a bit towards option 1, but not 100%..."
3,Sparty,Balls were a bit older and more used than I expected. Past balls purchased from Brenzer were much higher quality and cheaper.
4,cats meow,"Enjoyed this book alot and being a cat liver, I see several quilts that I would like to make got me and my family"
4,Cute,"I have a lot of quilt books. This is one of the books I like best. I've made several of her patterns, the descriptions are good and correct. Janet Kime has original ideas."
4,I Liked This Book!,"Loved the characters: Scarface and Hadrian scared the bejeezus out of me. Appreciated the forces that drove the main character; thought the story was well-conceived and flowed as it should. Would have liked to see more back story written, but I also appreciated the Icelandic saga-like spareness of it. Glad to see this writer published and am waiting for more."
5,Favorite Strings,"I love Gibson strings on my Washburn Electric, there is just something that is vintage sounding with these kinds of strings. I use them for more heavy/rock blues songs on this guitar."
2,It does not work with all computers,"We bought one but it did not work with HP computers. After hours of tech support they sent us several ""new"" items which had the same problem. They finally sent a new one which (surprise surprise ) ......... did not work as well. ""It Did not work"" means that it stopped the backup and the computer could not see the drive.In some computers it does work ( Dell ) for example ( after they sent us several items, of course) but with HP, forget about it.We wanted to return it and get the money back - they refused.Good policy for the company, bad for the consumer."
4,Witch Boy Blood war review.,"I loved the story i was wanting it for some time could not find it any where esle' looket on Amazon and Bam there it was it is the exciteing end to this wonderful intriging story,."
2,A good movie botched by translators.,"This is a prime example of how translators botch a good movie. I don't like dubbed-in movies to begin with, because conversation is part of acting and cannot be duplicated in another language. But this movie is much worse: the original Dutch conversation is turned down in volume and a voice is simultaneously translating what is being said at a louder volume by somebody who could well be a court interpreter. But not in English; in Spanish! Subtitles are in English, but sometimes they flash by too fast to read. At times there is a strong echo which confuses the viewer, and at other times, the actors are obviously speaking, but no sound is heard. This is definitely the worst release of any movie I ever saw. It the Spanish voices were left out, I would give it a four star rating."
5,2007 and still no DVD!,"Well, it's December 2007, I'm heading off to the Tahoe slopes and STILL no DVD! My VHS copy is the one and only reason I still have that VHS box collecting dust at my Tahoe Donner cabin. A European DVD is out, so what's the problem?One irony about the movie is that about that time Sonja Henie trashed her reputation in Norway by declining to participate in fundraising for the Norwegian resistance/government-in-exile."
4,Sun Valley Serernade,"I am enjoying the video, however, it took nearly three months for me to receive it.Other than that I have only good things to say about it. The Glenn Miller Band it awesometheir music was unforgettable. Thank you."
1,rip Off! video is encrypted.,"I bought this cd single solely for the Slow Hands video as I already had all the audio tracks from previous releases. I am a big Interpol fan and have at least one copy of every cd release but they act all bloody precious about their videos. they encrypt them with a program called ""open disc"" - talk about an ironic name. Perhaps their video director(s) are the ones being all precious. i heard floria sigismondi is a bit touchy about her music video directing. come on interpol sell your videos on itunes, amazon or put them on a dvd.on second thought, the editors second release was better than interpol's third release and they sell all their videos on itunes so i'm not sure i'm as big an interpol fan as i used to be..."
1,Avoid this misleading product.,"This kit was a big let down for my kids. The main issue I have is that the ""pyrite"" my kids dug out of the block of plaster looked like plan old rocks. Nothing at all like the beautiful gold colored pyrite they show on the packaging. This was frustrating for them as they expected some a bit more than plan old rocks. The rocks in the kit don't even come close to approximating what they show in all the product images:Toysmith 4 M Gold Mining Kit #03259"
4,Outdoor toy!,"We just used this today, a snow day, and although my son thought it was fun, it was very messy. The chips flew everywhere and the gravel is all over the floor. This would make a great activity to do outside on a table during the summer. It's certainly not an interactive toy, and once the rocks are out it's pretty much over, but he was thrilled with the challenge. He sat there and chipped away for a good two hours at least. There is still plenty of plaster left to dig through, too. We'll save that for a nicer day."
5,MIXER,this is a mix of disneymania 1 2 and 3 in concert so here is the track listing1.Proud Of Your Boy(clay aiken)2. Colors Of The Wind( ashinti)3. True To Your Heart( raven)4. And Many More
2,Endurance,This video poorly writen and acted. Yes! Haile is a great runner but he is not a very good acter. that is one of the reason the film fail me. I am an Ethiopian I understand most of film just because they speak Amharic otherwise for other people the film lose the follow... Haile could have make very good interview instead of video film. I have a lot of question that the video didn't answer... What is his stand about long distance runner running for other country? [Mind you I didn't ask why he is not run for other country] etc etc...
4,Was as expected.,You get what you pay for. And It's for only one day of the year and my son loved it.
1,basura,Pues solamente un trapo page mucho para resivir algo muy sencillo yo recomendaria no comprarlo la misma calidad y mucho mas bajo presio lo pueden encontrar en cualquier 99c.store
5,Hometown Ska!!,"A great CD that brings back some great memories of THE premier Chicago ska band of the 1980's. There's some great dance tunes here. Kate's vocals are just as biting as ever, and Frankie's sax still wails! Makes me wanna pull out my leather jacket with all my ska pins, find some skinny ties and head out to the Cubby Bear!!"
2,not very good,This was a stupid movie. The acting wasn't very good and I did not care about the characters at all.
2,Lonely Planet - Vietnam,The version of this book that was available at time of purchase was very outdated making pricing hugely wrong & many restaurants & accommodation establishments no longer there.Note that the new version has just been released (Feb 2012). I would certainly recommend getting the latest especially if you are planning a visit in the near future.
3,"Okay, but not good if you're looking for interesting restaurants/bars in Hanoi or HCM","I've made one Hanoi trip and one HCM trip. The standard tourist destinations are identified and covered. However, the restaurants and bars section is very weak. It is the typical ""white man's choice"" kind of places. If I go to Vietnam I want to find good places that the locals go to. The guide provide both expensive and cheap choices but most are of the ""white man's choice"". Finally, the new editions of the these books are a joke. It is more a way to make money than to update content. Most of the content remains unaltered across editions. If they can't update all content, they shouldn't issue a new edition. Or at least provide a way of telling when a new edition is a major new edition.) I would recommend thodia.vn and using Google Translate to find interesting place to eat and drink."
2,Lonely Planet Vietnam,"I bought this book in anticipation of my upcoming trip to VN. Having gotten great help from LP Guides over the years, I was sure that this was the book I needed. Wrong. This book is superficial and only marginally useful. Certainly not what a serious traveler need in VN!Shame on you, Lonely planet. You can do so much better."
1,Buy another book,"I have used LP books for a lot of my travels throughout Southeast Asia and usually am pretty satisfied with my experience. This LP book on Vietnam though, does not live up to the standards of other LP travel books!I lived in Vietnam for three months this past summer. Going through the book, I found out that key details about travel services were missing, maps were wrong, and restaurant recommendations were off the mark. An example of how the book was not up to par: I wanted to plan a trip to Bach Ma National Park while in Hue. Once I arrived, I realized the descriptions of the trails in the book were almost word for word copies of the free trailmap given out to tourist! Nothing new or insightful at all about the descriptions.I would recommend having this LP book over having nothing, but your better off getting something more reliable.Happy travels."
3,A pleasant drive.,"An interesting idea: drive the U.S. coast of the Great Lakes and see what you run into. Well written overall with a few excellent vignettes. The fact is, it does start getting a tad tedious by the time you reach Lake Superior, which seems a shame. This might have been better if Blocksma had decided to go more into the history of these places or made it a more personal journal (e.g., Blocksma omits meetings with friends and family and the reader has little idea what's going on in her life at the time). In the end it's a pleasant trip, despite the bouts of rain, but would I want to reread it? Probably not."
5,Good quality,The book was in good condition and holds up to my stringent requirements of quality. This was a good buy and showed up quickly.
4,Christian manhood - have we lost it?,"I found this book to be very insightful and left me feeling motivated daily to be a better man and husband. I did find it challenging at times to understand the complexity of our inability to be this perfect yet at the same time the simplicity in what we are asked to do. Simple in the text, complex in reality. I am also fortunate to have a very loving Christian wife, I was wondering at times about men who don't have this and the challenges they must face. It would be interesting to discuss specific examples with Mr Weber and hear his thoughts. Maybe another book idea.....? Would love to read it."
5,A Great Book!,"This is the type of book that will challenge any man to be bigger than they already are and better than they should be, and really to rise to the test of being the man that their wives and their children hope for. The book ties in spirituality and common sense, and brings it all together into a book that is an easy read (as you will want to continue) while at the same time a challenging read as it makes you question your own beliefs and feels about being a man in today's society. I know that for me this was a great book and one that I have already passed on to other guys that I know! I recommend this to any man in today's society that struggles in being the man that God wants him to be!"
2,"BUY THE SINGLE, NOT THE ALBUM!",I WAS UPSET WHEN I GOT THE ALBUM I LOVE THE SINGLE AND THE VIDEO FOR SHE'S ALL I GOT... I THOUGHT THE ALBUM WOULD BE PROMISING BUT IS NOT..... I DONT KNOW HOW HE FOOLED CLIVE DAVIS WITH HIS VOCALS CAUSE HE NEEDS SOME SERIOUS PRODUCTION..... JIMMYS VOCALS ARE NOT THAT STRONG HERE.... THE SONG WITH ALICIA KEYS IS TIGHT THO' I WILL GIVE HIM THAT BUT I MUST SAY YOUR CUTE IN ALL BUT THE ALBUM IS TIRED.... I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SINGLE.... I LIKE TO SEE HOW CLIVE IS GONNA GET THIS ALBUM TO GOLD.....
1,How did he get a deal??,"I have to say that I was initially very excited by the prospect of another great J Records release. Of late I've been pleased with J Records' hit albums including the new Luther Vandross and the phenomenal Alicia Keys. Then along comes Jimy Cozier. At least I can say that I was fortunate enough to have been able to preview the album before I would have purcahsed it...otherwise I would be even more displeased. The album smacks of generic, repetitive R&B songs which are now so trite and bland. Honestly, there was not ONE song on the album which I enjoyed. Cozier also lacks the vocal ability to breathe life into these lack luster songs. J Records, two outta three ain't bad!"
2,WHERE IS HE NOW?,"I don't know if it was something in the air around Spring 2001 but it seemed like we had several artists to come out with one hit and we have yet to hear anything good or see them ever agian including Jimmy (Koffee Brown ""After Party"", Sunshine Anderson ""Heard it all Before"" and Blu Cantrell ""Hit em Up Styles"") I loveed his first single they played it about twice the night of my Senior Prom, he had a very mediocre second single that I barely remember but I am assuming this is the last that we will ever hear from him."
4,Excellent Film,"Double Indemnity is one of Hollywood's greatest movies ever. It has everything a great movie needs, great acting, superb direction, a brilliant theme and lots of tension. The only problem with this movie is that it is slow in the beginning but it then picks up once the two protagonists or should I say antagonists execute their devious plot. Edward G.Robinson steals the show with his witty character. Fred McMaurray is pretty annoying with his accent and way of speaking but all round great acting! One of those movies which inspire filmmakers and set new standards. You have to see this!"
5,Double Indemnity,"One of the quintessential noir films, Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is a masterpiece of stark atmosphere and carefully stylized suspense. The talented Barbara Stanwyck, a familiar face in the 1940s noir universe, assumes her role with feline deviousness, while ""My Three Sons"" TV dad Fred MacMurray--narrating the film via flashback--brilliantly plays against type. Raymond Chandler's screenplay sizzles with hard-boiled repartee and the great Edward G. Robinson is aces as always as the dogged investigator hot on the lovers' trail. Sinister, tense, and cynical, Wilder's ""Indemnity"" is riveting film suspense."
4,Quintessential Noir,"If you see one film noir film in your life this very well may be the one to see. It follows the classic doomed loved triangle plot, a blonde (although an awful wig) femme fatale, a tailor made fall guy, and almost every noir visual cue that you could think of (cigarette smoke, rain, neon, venetian blinds). Stanwyck is good, MacMurray is great (baby!), but the real scene stealer here is Edward G. Robinson and his ""little man"". The creative team behind the film doesn't get any better either with the powerhouse noir team of James M. Cain's original novel, adapted for the screen by Raymond Chandler and directed by the peerless Billy Wilder. This film, finally out of DVD is a can't miss!"
2,"""If you're not falling down, you're not risking enough"" ?","This book seems okay, if you want to learn to go down the mountain in a permanent twist with your shoulders square to the board, your knees torqued, and your hands out like you're directing an orchestra. The quote from page 66 'if you're not falling down at all, you're probably not risking enough in your training' is the best, though.There are some good books out there, and some good instructive online resources. I suggest you check those out instead."
3,It's Okay,"I bought it on Kindle, but frankly, with all the information that is updated on the internet, I find just the same amount there. I do like the idea of practicing on the carpet, and when I get my board (I'm brand new at this, but it looks fun and my son can do it.)That is in the book, and I will do it. I think the book is a bit outdated, but for the $6.39, I have pros and cons. The Kindle pictures (cause I didn't put it on my Android, my Ipod Touch, or my PC which I should) are not good. But that can be achieved by downloading the book to one of my other Kindle sources. The copyright is 1998, and it is outdated, but for a beginner, it's fair."
1,Junk,"Will not work on 2008 tundra, keeps slipping even cut off the 67mm so the 65 fits all they way still slipped, put a hose clamp around it to keep it from expanding, still slipped, don't buy,,,,"
2,Gave it an hour and it never took off.,We watched the movie for an hour with high expectations based on the reviews. However we turned it off and didn't finish. It's way too slow and very boring.
4,One Woman's Opinion,"The concept - a community college professor turns criminal mastermind to break his wife out of jail - was a little hard to swallow. Once you get past that, the movie moved along at a swift pace with lots of action. Russell Crowe is always fun to watch - he really makes you believe in the character. All in all, an entertaining way to spend an evening."
3,Better than expected!,I wish I had Disregarded most of the 3 star reviews as I would have rented sooner! Much better than expected.
4,Great Movie!,Lots of suspense and twists and turns. The movie was full of great actors. Russell Crowe did a great job. The first hour set up a lot of the movie but the second half was great.
3,Tedious,"Mixed feelings about this movie, ""edge of your seat"" moments yet it almost seemed to be a chore to finish watching to completion."
4,Action packed,"Fast paced action packed movie with a few twists and turns. Makes you think you know who ""done"" it, then takes a whole new direction."
3,only 2.5 days,"The premise is good, and the cast excellent. Apparently, the producers forgot that there is an editing studio. No way that movie should have been over 2 hrs. It is also somewhat startling to see the naive teacher morph from the victim of a scam, to the bumbler who breaks off a key, to the stud who breaks into the meth lab to rob the dealers. Probably would never have thought twice about any of that, except there was all that down time which gave me time to think about these pesky little details.still, it's an OK flick..."
1,Get's Lost....,"I liked Paul Haggis when he did Crash, but it seems like he's lost something. He didn't do Russell Crowe any favors here either. This film seems lost, not sure of where it's going. It gets lost in the weeds, buried in way too much detail. Not my idea of nice way to spend an evening."
4,Great Movie,"I can't really put my finger on why, but I love this movie. I run a movie theater and definitely would consider myself a movie buff, and this one just stuck with me for some reason. It's not great by any means, but I really enjoyed it. It's a bit long, but for the most part keeps the intensity going throughout. There's one cheesy scene that warrants a major eye-roll, but otherwise the acting and directing is well-done. The plot and sequence of events, while certainly not realistic, is believable enough for you to buy into it and gain a sense of gravity for the characters and their actions. I haven't seen the original, but I'd like to if I can find it on Netflix or as a cheap purchase somewhere.The actual dvd (blu-ray) set is just ok, not a lot of special features. A feature on just the making of the escape sequence would have been great. Don't get your expectations high, but do give this movie a chance, it's pretty entertaining."
4,The next three days,"I thought this was a terrific movie. Full of suspense and not knowing if she really did commit the murder until the very end. Most movies you can figure out what happens during the movie and it's not very suspenseful. This one had me guessing. I'm not huge fan of Russell Crowe, but this movie he did well in.Another recommendation for Russell Crowe movies, is A Beautiful Mind."
2,Boring and Dragged Out,"Crowe and Elizabeth Banks were fine, but they could have benefited from better direction and writing. This was a confusing mess, and after a while started to really drag out. It got way too bogged down in the details for me. After a while I was yawning. And please explain why this was set in Pittsburgh? That made no sense to me."
3,Russell Crowe and the Next Three Days,"I did not enjoy this movie, I found it very dark. I guess I expecyed more from Russell Crowe and pictures of Pittsburgh.At the time I ordered HELP when it came out and so far have not heard of it any more.Mildred Pfeifer"
5,What Would You do For Love?,This action packed drama stars russel crow in his best role since robin hood. This is a great movie. The story is great the action is great and so are the actors. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
4,Wonderful for an adult audience (under 20? don't bother),"This is a well done story that has our hero realistically come up with several ideas to free his wife from jail or make money to finance their escape that don't work, but is so determined that he keeps at it until he hits on ideas that do. This makes his successes more sweet, and you can feel how close he is to missing his chance, messing up or running out of time, or getting caught by the police who get several lucky breaks and are close on his tail. The process he goes through is interesting and builds the story, but is very much not for the younger among us who demand hot action every three minutes or else! Liam N. and Brian D. are both excellent in small roles. This movie is powerful if you can put yourself in the situation, and I found it smart and inspiring."
3,A little drawn out,"Interesting story, but not enough story-line for the length of the movie. We chose this movie because of the cast and were not disappointed by their performances."
3,Well written but predictable,"Lawson is a masterful writer of descriptions and subtletly. She has a good understanding of psychology and found a good subject - four orphans living in a farm town, the two older brothers take care of the two little girls. But it is very easy to see what is going to happen pretty early on and this got in the way of my enjoyment. Kate was a pretty stock character - the insular person who finally discovers truths about herself in the end. A very good first effort. I agree with the reader who said framing the story in the ""mystery"" of what happened to Matt was unnecessary. Also, what is the deal with authors not describing the looks of the characters anymore. This really bugged me. We had no real idea of what anyone looked like."
5,Jewels,"These stories were so completely perfect- so compelling that I read through them all and longed for more at the end. They cover London and the countryside, every class and just about every condition without compromising either story or plot. I am shocked that I am the only reviewer- Pritchett has been cited by so many authors as their favorite storyteller that I expected he would have a huge following. These tales, written over the course of his lifetime are particularly powerful after WWII. He draws the structure-loving British groping to put things back to normal when there is no more normal, the foundations have been ruptured. They are economical and illuminating with no small bit of irony at the end. He joins Maugham and Cheever as the masters of their times and only one other- Carver- can come close to their success and genius. Check him out, especially if you're enamoured of a good story, anything British and genuine compassion without sentimentality."
3,works if u play with it,works if u play with it but i shoulda known not to purchase a after market product so this is chalked up to experence
5,"Beautiful, strong Teapot",Love this teapot. It is beautiful and strong. Should last a long time being cast iron. Be careful as it gets REALLY hot!
1,Red Scarf Girl is the worst book ever.,"Red Scarf GirlBy Jili JangHave you read a book that isn't interesting? Well Red Scarf Girl by Jili Jang isn't what you want to read. I don't want to read this book because it isn't interesting. Sometimes it is hard to follow the book for example first she is reading a book then she is out on the street in a crowd trying to break a sign. See I don't think you get it.Anyways Jili is a girl who has a bad back round and is getting teased because of it. Also the whole town is trying to get rid of fourolds and Jili's family has tons of them and gets her house searched.This book does not catch your attention and you kind of can't see what is happening in the story, but if you are a person who likes reading autobiographies on people who is loyal and has love for her family then you should read this book. If you are not sure if you want to read the book read the back of the book. Red Scarf Girl by Jili Jang."
5,A great book - must read,Red Scarf Girl is a book about a young Chinese girl who tells her personnel experiences during the time of the Cultural Revolution. It tells about the tragedy's and lose that the people in China had to go through at this time. This book tells about Ji-li and her family at this time and all what they had to go through. This is a great book. It is very interesting and a great story about a real life experience of a girl at the time of the Cultural Revolution. This is a great and interesting book to read.
3,Red Scarf Girl is the book to read!,"Have you ever thought that you didn't have a good class status? Well, this girl didn't! That's girl name is Ji-Li. Ji-Li hated going to school just because of her class status! Can you believe it?! Some people get teased and they still like going to school.Well Ji-Li lives in China. She lives in a house with her mom, dad, brother, and sister. Her brother's name is Ji-yong. And her sister's name is Ji-yun. Ji-Li has this one best friend. Her best friend understands Ji-Li a lot. Her best friend's name is An yi. An Yi has always been there for Ji-Li. An Yi stood up for Ji-Li when Ji-Li was in trouble.One day, she went to school, and something terrible happened! Read this book, ""Red Scarf Girl"" by Ji-Li Jiang. I don't like this book, but other people will. Different people have different tastes of books. Find out what this terrible thing did to her life!"
5,omigod this is THE beeeeessssssst book!!!,"I am in fith grade and am 11 years old. I read this book and i seriously could NOT put it down. It is FULL of sespense and is the ULTIMITE book for you if you like suspense and social stuff. Definitely DO NOT judge this book by it's cover. Read this book, my friend!!!!!"
2,"Good sounds quality, but not comfortable.","I bought these headphones for the full price of $44 dollars, and letme tell you, they were not worth the price. Although the overall quality of the mic and sound are okay, the comfortableness of these headphones is just awful. Although the padding around the earpiece certainly looks very cozy, in reality, they are hard, and hurt my ears. I cannot wear these for more than 45 minutes without getting an awful headache. I'm giving them two stars becasue the mic clarity is actually pretty nice, but overall, they just are not good. I do not recommend buying them."
5,Great Headset!,"I don't think that I bought these headphones off of Amazon but I have them, and they are great! The bass is awesome and isn't muddy either. Everything else is ok, but for your money this headset is sooooo worth it. It is hard to set up on windows 7 though, probably because I didn't use the software that came with it. I originally bought them for Rosetta Stone but I stopped doing Rosetta Stone and they are good for other music until my Bose QC 15 headphones come in the mail. This is a great headset"
2,"Nice headset, poor construction","I bought my LifeChat LX-3000 at Staples and paid full retail. The headset works well, but the microphone is attached to the headset with a cheap little plastic joint. Mine snapped after about 6 months of light use. You are better off buying a higher quality set, or just be prepared to buy a new one every year."
5,quentin's review,"This product has excellent sound quality, sometimes I did have problems with the mic, but rarely."
4,Good product,"I bought this product because the speakers and microphone on my laptop stopped working (bad computer, but it gets the job done). I use this headset primarily to skype with family and friends. For that, it's great. I've talked for two hours sometimes and I have no complaints. My ears start to get a little sore, but having anything on your ears for that long will do that. The microphone quality is top notch and the audio quality is great. I even use it just to listen to music sometimes and it's way better than any other set of headphones I own. Over all, I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an inexpensive way to up the quality of your computer's speakers and microphone."
5,Better then expected,"I was given this item as a suggestion for a headset/mic to use with Skype and did so a bit reluctantly. However, once I recieved it, and installed it within a minute or two, I was impressed. While the headset is snug, it does give you great sound quality. The ability to adjust the mic placement is great. I especially like the volume controls option as well as the mute feature. I have been extremely impressed so far!"
1,Horrible Product!! 3 Sets went bad with same issue!,"I had three of these sets and had all 3 go out with the same issue within 3 months. The box that controls volume goes bad. You will start to hear a crackle sound anytime you touch the controls to adjust volume, etc. Then you know they are on their way out."
4,LX-3000,"Nice product and pretty good sound for a low dollar item. Good volume control and above average comfort for extended operation, mic placement and performance is a little weak but well worth the price."
2,Limited functionality on Mac,"Note that on Macs (at least on my 2011 Macbook Air running Lion), the built-in volume controls don't work (they control the built-in speakers instead of the headphone).Also note that the volume controls in the Preferences panel only have four settings, and I find the lowest setting is too loud for comfort.Finally, the ear cuffs are slightly too small for my ears (which are not unusually large).Other than that, it seems to be a nice product. Both the headphone and microphone are very sensitive (perhaps too sensitive), and it seems to be reasonably well built. I would imagine that when used on a Windows machine with the appropriate software installed, it works fine.Since Microsoft does not claim that this product works with Macs, I have no reason to complain. However, since there are other reviews which suggest that this product works just fine on Macs, I felt that I should add my experience with it."
3,Not bad for 20 bucks,"I googled ""Sturdy headset"" and eventually found these recommended on a forum. I needed a sturdy headset because I keep destroying every new set I buy. These are not as great as I would have hoped. They are comfortable enough, not perfect, but I do wear them for hours without much discomfort or complaints. Sound and mic quality are okay. The major complaint I have is that the cord is not long enough and I do not like the in-line volume controls. The in-line controls are very bulky and get caught on my desk very easy, and I can already tell that this will be the first thing to break on this headset. All in all, not bad for $20, but not as sturdy as I need."
2,NOT RECOMMENDED,"This headset has decent, although not the greatest sound. The thing I HATE about them is the cord gets horribly twisted. I have to fix the cable every day and as time passes this gets worse. The cable is so twisted now I can no loner fix it. It's as if there's a wire running through it. I use the headset for many hours a day. My ears get extremely sore. There's no way to adjust the width. I would not recommend this product."
1,It only work for once.,"Got the headset follow instruction to install the software, it was good and clear but only one use than it is dead. I really like it since the sound was very clear, but now it does not work and I have to return for refund. The quality should be much better then this, it was pretty dispointed."
1,Like Water Torture,"This headset works fine, although the audio quality leaves quite a bit to be desired in my opinion. However wearing these is like torture. They are heavy and restrictive on your ears and I cannot wear them for more than 3 minutes before the pressure on my temples becomes unbearable and my ears get all hot and itchy. I have never worn such an uncomfortable headset before. Stay well away is my advice."
2,Doesn't impress,"Here's a summary of why I would give it 2 stars:- Awkward ear alignment that is uncomfortable... why am I smooshing my ears into holes in hard foam rings? From this experience I can tell you it's not one-size-fits-all.- Poor sound quality. It's not the worst, but it's enough you can notice pings of scratchy sound distortion here and there. I would not want to watch movies or play games on these.- Decent casual use microphone. Not good enough for recording since it doesn't perfectly filter other noise, but somewhat better than the worst bargain rate microphones.- Retail price is ridiculous. If you need a chatting only headset this is maybe worth the $15-20 marked down, but the original retail is ridiculous for this rather limited product."
4,Microsoft lifechat lx-3000 is it good?...,"The Microsoft-Lifechat-LX3000 Headset , is a very easy and great headset. Less then 30 dollars and the sound on this thing is great,you can higher or lower the- volume. There is also the mute button and the quick call button for use for Skype , there's an install cd for PC Which is fast and 'easy' Also this works for ps3 and xbox360. Usb rocks... i give this a four out of five. Why not five? well i dropped my headset 3 feet and the talking thing almost came off but its held on by the wires but! still works ""Perfect"" a very strong and reliable headset!!!!!!!! a mustbuy ;]"
4,GOOD headset for Long run from microsoft,"Very GOOD USB headset, mic/sound quality is also pleasent. One good thing about microsoft headset is it cost low, and it comes with USB . I have no problem with it tell now."
4,Good for the price,"Good delivery service. These headphones work well, great for chatting for language lessons online. They are a little bit big but I not uncomfortable. I haven't used them for many hours at once, but they are good. Very good deal for the price I paid."
2,Excellent head crushing device.,"Made for a small child; squeezes like a vice.Microphone quality is very good, but if you don't want it in front of your face all day then it's a pain, because it's difficult to position up out of the way."
2,Product works but with serious problems. Cannot Recommend,"Just everyday guy doing a review. This product is aimed at normal, not techy, individuals. So I am just the right guy to write this review.Pro:WorksCon:Not comfortable at all for long(5+ min) conversation. Your ears just start to get hot and sweaty. The padding on the ears are not soft at all. Plus, there is not headband padding on top.Mic position is rather difficult to adjust.Mic is default at 0 Volume. People have to figure out how to turn up mic volume because the volume button on the line are the headphone volume.Mic is really quiet from what other people have told me.Good luck if you are buying this product. I do not recommend it."
3,Pretty Good,"It's good, the microphone is very clear. That's really the only thing I was looking for, but, the headset is about a 2/5 on comfort. I can deal with it but it hurts my ears after about 2 hours. It's not tight on my head but the Cups are to small. I plan on getting a new one once I get some more money."
3,I expected more,"After watching it a couple times, some of the skits grew on me, but in the beginning I was disappointed. I guess that I just didn't agree with what they considered to be the ""best"" of SNL for that year. But Mike Myers' ""Phillip"" skit with Nicole Kidman was hysterical..."
3,fits like a glove....,It's pretty good. just make sure you have a screen protector as it will be unprotected with this clip. You can get a much better case on ebay seller cellbatt for the same price.
3,There's too much boring drumming,"I can recommend a few tracks from BURN. Pauline Kael described the THEME FROM BURN as ""syncopated Gregorian chant"". Which isn't too shabby a description. THEME FROM BURN features an electric piano that's played very percussively, with a lot of attack-and-decay. INTO THE FUTURE is a moody ambient choral masterpiece, but unfortunately it includes cacophonous woodwinds that really set my teeth on edge. GENERAL JOSE DELORES is a beautiful tune with a sweet majestic organ (if I can say that without sounding pornographic)."
5,As a mother of four canine kids...,What a wonderful story. The book doesn't end the journey - Lois is holding a fundraising event to help raise awareness and funds to save more dogs' lives. What dedication! See www.hearttohearthustle.com to learn about her amazing efforts!
4,Develop ideas.,"This may seem to be out of my normal areas of interest, but one can learn a great deal of strategy from various 'how to' books. This one is well organized and includes creative exercises, such as getting out of a hostile crowd."
1,Wes Craven Wishes His Name Wasn't Attached To This Bomb,"Seeing this online, I didn't look hard enough at the credits and thought Wes Craven directed this, but he didn't. This is possibly one of the worst ""horror"" movies to have Craven's name attached to it. The acting is so poor that some scenes are unintentionally laughable, and Divoff's villain's voice is so silly, that he ruins any chance of seeming threatening. Apparently there are enough viewers with no taste in decent horror movies, that they managed a couple of sequels to this dog.Now it's not that I'm a purist. There are low budget horror movies with crappy acting that still come off creepy, like ""Evil Dead"", but Wishmaster was a waste of celluloid, pure and simple."
2,Unremarkable but not totally horrible,"Who knows what prompted me to see this movie in the first place? I certainly cannot answer that, but I guess it saying something that I didn't walk out midway through the movie. Of course that might be because the movie is relatively short.It isn't dreadfully bad, but just thoroughly unremarkable in all respects. Cheesy dialogue, disengaged acting, and special effects that are competent though hardly inspiring is what distinguishes this movie. Some people with statue fetishes might find a few scenes noteworthy but otherwise this movie leaves no lasting impact. The fact that film, which performed tepidly at the box office, inspired 3 sequels (at least) serves as further testament to the utterly deplorable state of the US fiml industry.That having been said, renting this film will not leave you feeling totally ripped off, so enjoy the limited entertainment value it provides."
2,I WISH This Movie Had Been Better! (** 1/2 out of 5),"I really wanted to like this movie. Wes Craven is a master in film-making, and I got my hopes up. Well, needless to say, I was let down. In this violent and gruesome movie, a djinn (or genie) escapes from his 'prison'; a magic red-ruby. The djinn goes around granting wishes in his own way--giving the wisher want they want in a deadly style. For example: wish to be beautiful forever, turn into a plastic doll or something. So, the djinn needs to grant pretty Alexandrea's wishes in order to rule the world. One question: why? Did I miss something? This movie sadly falls flat. It's one strength is special-effects...and they're not that great either. Worth viewing when you're very bored. Otherwise, it's not all that good at all."
5,Few movies keep my interest long -- I still rave of this one,"I loved this movie! In order for a movie to keep my interest it must be different and very good. This one certainly covers both catagories. I loved it. It's the kind of thing I enjoy writing about myself.It starts out with action, slows down, and concludes with even more action. There is action in the middle, but it's concentrated more on teaching about the Djinn (Andrew Divoff) so everything is understood better and more believable. Few movies are this believable, even true ones!No matter how much money someone spends, there are few movies written and portrayed so well that they're this convincing!"
1,terrible,"this is a terrible horror film, it reminds me alot of Grim, and the monsters are fake looking, and they are ugly. its about something you must fear that is called a djin or something if you've read the poem at the beginning of the movie, not exactly a poem, but a summery or a story. It happens at the beginning of Star War movies, you know."
3,Excellent product; Wrong Base,"This is a fabulous product, is rugged, is easily adjusted for different positions and our two laptops. But. I discovered after it arrived that it did not fit my rig. I bought it with a base plate for big Chevy/GMC pickups, without power seats. My dealer now tells me I have Chevy/GMC Van seats. Needed a different base. Not offered online (or I could not find it). Took it to a specialty welder who made me a new appropriate base and it now works great! I did not know what I did not know, and could not discover online the solution. Chalk this up to an inexperienced customer."
5,"June 29, 1999 is awesomely funny!","Just because the date is gone, done give this book a pass. Holly Evans has a great science project with unbelievable results. I read June 29, 1999 on that date because it begged me to do so & what an amazing visual adventure it turned out to be! This otherworldy story will be with us for a long time. I encourage you to read it - it'll change your point of view about vegetables! .................."
2,Save your money and read the manual,The aquascape installation instructions for a pondless waterfall are probably a better guide.
2,Not what I thought,"This magnet is fine, but much smaller that expected. The measurements shown on the description were much bigger than the actual magnet. Do you have a bigger one?"
3,A good message,"While the message is very good, it is repeated too often. It is an illustration showing how to succeed using the habits of successful people."
4,Excellent,A must read for those who wish to push their performance in anything to the next level. He allowed me to squat weights I wouldn't have been able to life before!
1,Harvest,If you like a boring movie about farming then this will be your cup of tea. I found it to be long and tiresome and with sub titles to boot makes this even worst.
4,"I Laughed, I Cried","I read this delightful book in one night, unable to put it down! Brian captured the essence and nuances of Las Vegas so perfectly with believable characters and a great story. I loved his on-target descriptions of psychic world. I want more!"
5,"Great ""Las Vegas"" Book!!!!","I am a person who reads a lot. I can pick up the Sunday paper with its list of best sellers and I will have often read over half of them! I visit ""Las Vegas"" four times a year and watch and read everything written and shown concerning it..This is one of the best fiction books that I have read about the town in a long, long time....I would guess that sometime there may even be a movie or TV mini-series taken from this story..I think everyone who likes easy to read fiction (whether about ""Vegas"" or not) will enjoy it a great deal...."
2,"Music is good, recording has no bass","Can't listen to reggae without bass. Period. Horrible 80's recording quality ruins this otherwise decent CD. Oh well, now we are in the 21st century where everything is recorded too loud, no happy medium."
2,Stopped working after a few weeks,"I bought this fan to replace a really old bathroom fan. Removing the old fan meant breaking the drywall and patching it after this new one was installed. Tested it and it worked well though very loud. After a few weeks I noticed the speed of the fan starting off very slow then increasing to high speed. After a few days it stopped working completely! I don't want to rip it out the wall to return it so now I have to shell out money for an ""upgrade"" kit to replace the entire motor and fan. What a big disappointment for me. I can't believe that the fan only worked for a few weeks!"
2,Warning!,The one I bought was very loose and it split along the formed bend in the recess under the ruler the first day I had it. This caused the jaws to fall out of alignment. Most of the edges were very sharp and the corners were not rounded. Not pocket friendly! Poor quality for such a high price. The only good score for it was that it was reasonably accurate.
1,Was not relaxing or soothing.,"I did not find this CD very relaxing or soothing. I guess I prefer guided imagery and soothing music and nature sounds before bedtime. I found Gael rather irritating. I think it was her use of wording and her tone. She did not present in a positive, easy flowing manner. It was rather deep and thought provoking and would be more appropriate as a mental therapy CD. I found it created too much brain wave activity when I was hoping for sessions that would slow my mind down. Some people would find this CD very good, which I can understand, but it wasn't for me. I won't use this CD for completing my day. Please see my other reviews on meditation CD that are wonderful! Namaste'"
1,Not your mother's Pyrex. Avoid this product.,"We had this featured 9 x 13 inch Pyrex baking dish explode in the oven on Christmas Day, 12/25/07. We were baking a potato recipe in it, and about 30 minutes into baking, the dish exploded as I opened the oven door to remove a baking sheet on the rack above it. Broken glass and potato covered the inside of the oven. This is the second Pyrex dish I've had explode: the first was two years ago when I removed a casserole from the oven and set it on cork trivets to cool. I heard a large crash and ran into the room to find glass and food all over my kitchen. Some of the glass was found more than 10 feet away from the kitchen counter where the casserole was cooling. After this week's explosion, I won't be buying Pyrex ever again, and my glass Pyrex measuring cups went into the recycle bin. No more Pyrex in my house."
2,HYPE,don't buy into the hype! this chair is not all that. My husband and I both used these chairs and then sold them because the seat bed is not soft enough and it too much of a sling. It gave us both hip problems that went away when we went to a regular upholstered chair.
1,Doom & Gloom,"This is just another doom and gloom book designed to scare you into buying it. The author forgets about the basic law of supply and demand and what drives prices - scarcity. And there is strong demand and little supply of housing in San Diego and other popular West Coast cities. Further, the author ignores the projections of increasing population for California which will keep real estate prices high. Values won't keep going up forever, but they're not going to crash either. The ""Golden State"" is still golden and everyone wants to live here."
1,"yaa, yeah, doomsday,..snore..","no, not a kid,..a las vegas wage slave that made close to a million bucks,..buying and selling homes in Cedar City, Utah,..since this dreary crapola was published. Yeah, of course, if you're so stupid to buy spek houses in SF, LV, Miami, NY,..yaa, you're a dim bulb and deserve to end up hanging yourself when the 1's turn to 0's. Doomsday is for losers,..find a back eddy in the human entropic sewer, and it's kill time. This is a book for the timid human herd. Don't buy it."
3,NOT WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN,"The plot was good, the romance sweet, but the dialogue seemed weak. Every other sentence ended with the word ""too"" and much of the novel reminded me alot of Kingdom of Dreams by Judith McNaught. This story could definity use improvement."
5,Wow ! Garwood delivers another great story!,"I have just finished reading this wonderful book by Julie Garwood. I first got hooked on her after reading the stories of the Clayborne family (starting with For the Roses... that was made into a made for TV Movie, ""Rose Hill"". Then came the trilogy, and finally ""Come the Spring"", Cole's story, a personal Favorite!) When You read one of her books you instantly fall in love with her characters, and can't put it down. WARNING! Once you read one of her books you'll be hooked for life... I've never been disappointed with her writing, and am looking forward to reading many more. The Prize was an ""edge of your seat"" kind of read. I even found myself laughing at the end of one of the early Chapters, you'll have to read it to find out why :) This is a great book! ENJOY :)"
2,Silly!,"Judging by the other reviews in this site, it seems I am the only one who didn't like this book. I think it is the most insubstantial and fluffiest romance I have ever read. There was no real story line and throughout the book, the lead characters either kept scowling, grinning, shouting or being plain angry.The language was so stilted that it took me 3 days to finish this one!There was no character development and I found everyone in this book getting on my nerves."
2,not so much,"The volume is great. Loud enough to hear what I couldn't with the stock xbox headset. The motorola headset does crimp your head pretty tight after a couple hours of gameplay. The volume/mute control frequently falls out of the controller making you re-plug it back into the controller.My biggest gripe about this product is that after four months of use, the headphone cable has been flexed around enough and the wires inside are not making contact, thus I am losing functionality if the wires are bending a certain way. This is not good. The wiring from the headset to the controller is very small gauge and cheap. It looks like I will have to ditch this headset because the weakest link (the wire) has broken. Too bad, because the headset itself isn't that bad."
2,Hit and Miss,"I purchased this item brand new from Gamestop for about the same price as Amazon. Motorolla does make headsets for the NFL coaches so I thought that this would be a good investment. Excellent sound quality and mic (the foam thing on the mic cuts down extra noise you make from heavy breathing or from a fan).For the first 2-3 months it worked fine, but then it started losing sound and the mic wasn't working properly probably due to poor wiring or bad craftmanship with the male connectors on the headset to the controller. The headset is heavier than others, so there is more force that is needed to keep it on one's head and that's where it squeezes your temple area (the pad on the opposite side of the earphone).If you do purchase this hopefully you don't get a lemon. It's great when it works, but seeing that other people have had the same problems as I have, it's a 50/50 purchase."
4,sweet headset!,"This is a really nice headset which I would definately recommend. The sound quality is very good and it is comfortable to wear, unless you are a marathon gamer (which I will get to in the next sentance). The only problem with this headset is that after a while it will begin hurting your head a bit where the earpiece and other part is located. I'm not sure if I just have a big head but that seems to be the only problem. Other than this minor setback I highly recommend this microphone.P.S. While reading through the reveiws I saw alot of people who were obviously dissapointed in the headset. These were giving me mixed fellings about wether i shouuld buy this headset or not. Don't let these frazzle you this headset is 100% worth it."
1,"Headset good, but the wrong item was shipped!",I ordered the headset for the XBOX 360 that has the cord and volume control that plugs into the XBOX controller. What was shipped was the PS2 version that has a USB connection that does not work with the XBOX. I had to return it. So be careful.
1,Not for Xbox 360,"I ordered two sets of these for Xbox play. Though they are labeled for the Xbox 360, they both came with an 8' USB cord that obviously does not work with the Xbox. Returned them to Amazon (no problem). Then ordered the same thing from a different Amazon vendor (that was fulfilled by Amazon) as suggested by the Amazon rep that I talked to. AGAIN, was sent the headsets with the 8' USB cord (rather than the 2.5mm jack for the Xbox. Save yourself the hassle - don't buy this."
2,What a joke!,"I own an XBOX 360. I was not happy with the headset that came with it so I purchased the NFL ""Wireless"" headset. First of all IT'S NOT WIRELESS!!!The headset connects to the wireless controller by a wire that constantly gets in the way. 2-It drains your battery pack quickly.3- it's way to tight for an adult sized head. 4- my headset stopped working 2 months after I purchased it. I am now back using the original headset; you know it still works well."
2,Poor overall quality,"I found this to be a fairly poor investment. While it looks nice and is fairly comfortable, the cons outweigh the pros in this case. I soon noticed that the wiring quickly developed a malfunction which led to poor sound quality/ lost sound very early on. The wiring leading from the headset to the controller mount is thin and frail. The mount, which connects into my XBOX 360 controller, cannot be turned off, and if left plugged into the controller, continues to draw power, even when the console and controller are both turned off. The volume function is not absolute, while you can turn it to low, it will not turn completely off without unplugging it. While it does look nice, and fits somewhat comfortably for a time, I found this to be poor quality over-all."
3,Not what it advertises,"As an Xbox headset, it works fine. However, I bought it because it says you can do voice commands, which it does not. It claims you can pause or cally plays, and I could get it to do neither. It came with no usable documentation, and I cannot find any support online."
2,does not suit TZ3 well,"battery is ok, screen protector to small to cover TZ3 screen and the bag to large for TZ3: Amazon should be careful when advertize this kit with TZ3!"
1,This review of BLUE BLOODS is in the nature of a protest,"I own BLUE BLOODS Season One on DVD. The drama is interesting. It's a decent cop show. And I like Tom Selleck. What pisses me off with BLUE BLOODS Season Two is the blurry picture quality. My one star review is a response to the inferior video quality of Season Two compared to Season One on DVD. Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu-Ray, and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama, the acting and the writing seems as good as last season, but the picture quality is so poor I'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two. Maybe TV studios don't care about viewers watching on the DVD format, and just want it to die already. Well, NCIS is dead to me. And if BLUE BLOODS doesn't get their video act together they will be dead to me too.@hg47"
1,Diappointed,"Disappointed with this remote. The buttons are so small and the print is nearly impossible to read. There is no ""off"" button, so to turn the PS3 off you need to go to the box."
3,It's a remote...meh.,"The Good: a lot simpler and easier to use than the game controller if you want to watch movies. The button layout is fine and this looks just like any other of the hundreds of generic remotes out there. Plus it's cheap enough.The Bad: pretty much the only game in town unless you decide to use the game controller, which is very annoying. Not having an off button is weird and it is a sensitive remote in that the slightest touch on any of the buttons will turn the PS3 on. Bluetooth only means no universal remote so you Harmony owners are SOL.Bottom line: it's a necessity if you use the PS3 to watch movies. Sure, it's dead easy to use but it's also another addition to your remote collection."
3,"it's a controller, it works","hey it's a controller and it does what it's supposed to. Nothing special, but you don't have many choices with the ps3. It's overpriced, but better than others."
4,Works very well to play all Blue ray and normal DVD's,Is a great remote to use with the PS-3...does all the things and more as listed in another review.Easy to use and the battery lasts a long time.But i thing we should all have just one Universal remote
4,Great for Movies,"If you plan on using the PS3 as a Blu-ray/DVD player, a remote controller is a great idea. While the PS3 controller can be used for movies, this Blu-ray disc remote feels more natural. Bluetooth allows the remote to connect to the PS3 wirelessly. This is a great feature because the controller works anywhere in the room - it doesn't need to point at the system. The controller feels sturdy and functions well.Although you can turn on the PS3 with one button, there is no single-touch off button. You must open the main menu and choose to turn off the system. Sure, this only takes two seconds, but it is a pain (especially when the TV is turned off before the PS3). The lack of a glow-in-the-dark feature might annoy some people. However, the controller is well laid out and major buttons are easy to find without looking at them."
3,Better Than Using a Controller,"I bought this remote because using the controller to navigate the menus on bluray movies kinda sucks. This remote is better than that, but that's about it. It works, but I don't find the button layout to be all that intuitive. I understand that the remote has to use bluetooth, but it would be really handy if at least it could turn the volume on my TV up and down (like the XBOX 360 remote can) so I don't have to have two remotes handy all the time. It also is rather annoying that because it's bluetooth it's really easy to pause or stop the video you are watching by just bumping the remote, even if it's not pointed even sort of at the screen. Overall it's not a fantastic remote, but I doubt you are going to do much better."
5,Works like a champ!,Aside from a PS3 update causing me to have to re-sync all my controllers and this remote- works flawlessly and makes it easier to control the PS3 as a DVD/BD player for my 80yr old grandmother.
2,They didn't try very hard,"Cons:1) It is missing the 5-second skip-back feature accessible in the on screen PS3 menus. This would have been great to have a button for.2) The enter and directional pad are the only intuitive part of the thing. The remaining buttons are all similar rectangles which aren't easy to find by touch. The enter and directional buttons will work for pause, play, and ff/rw in DVD's only, not Blu-ray, so you're stuck using the rectangles when using Blu-ray.3) Did I mention there are a billion buttons and they're mostly either tiny or large rectangles. I thought designs like this were phased out in the 90's.Pros:1) Bluetooth means you don't have to point the thing in any particular direction.2) Still better than using the PS3 remote, but not as much as I'd hoped."
4,PS3 Remotes!! How do they work?!,"It's a remote. It doesn't have any glowie buttons, but it's still better than using a ps3 controller to play movies. If you're just looking for a Wii style controller you should wait for the new controllers to come out because this is a movie remote."
4,Worlds better than the game controller for navigating movies,"I had to buy this remote after repeated complaints from my wife that she didn't know how to use the game controller to navigate through movies. Granted, it's not an overwhelming challenge with the controller, but this remote is much more convenient. First, I like not having to push a connect button as required by the controller. This remote is fast and responsive, and has great coverage from wherever I am in the room. I haven't tested it from more than 15 feet from the PS3, but within this range it works perfect.The only thing I can't figure out is why there isn't a power button on the remote. I would like to be able to turn the system off with the remote, but the button is noticeably absent. I would also like it to be backlit for use in the dark. Other than that, it's a great remote. Sleek, attractive, and full of functionality. And best of all, the wife is happy!"
5,Remote PS3,"It rarely gets used but when it does, it is a nice device to have. You could use youe PS3 controller as it it wireless. But I find having a remote it somehting most of are accustomed to when watching tv, or movies."
4,I just wish it were smaller,This thing is HUGE!But it has transformed my husband's PS3 into a usable Blue Ray player.
5,Sony Bluray remote,Quality is Sony Standard.No backlit is a miss.Keys are big but hard to find in the dark.Battery is still going and I use it occasionally for about 6 months.Go for it!
4,Just a remote,"The Sony remote does a great job handling all the features on the PS3 and actually adds some function you don't need. Overall, great purchase."
4,Fine Remote,"The remote is fine, works very well but it has 2 issues that are more annoying then anything else. the buttons are very sensitive to being pressed and don't have much resistance to being pressed so even tossing a light blanket on top of it caused a button press, also the PS3 will turn on on any button press, it doesn't matter which button any will turn it on, that might be fixable with a firmware mod but as they haven't done it since the release of the remote years ago they probably won't. Otherwise its very good at being just a remote, just be careful of where you put it and what you place around or on top of it."
4,Batteries Dead On Arrival,"This product did not work ok when I received it - the batteries were old and dead. If I did not read someone's review on the Playstation Network that the same thing had happened to them, I would have been afraid and upset that the remote I just bought did not work at all. I put in some fresh rechargable batteries I had at home and the remote worked fine. Just do not be suprised if the remote fails to work with your Playstation 3, don't panic until you put in some fresh batteries and then register it under accessory settings. Good luck!"
5,Good controller; almost necessary to watch Blu-Ray movies,"Good controller; almost a must if you have a PS3. Control is by bluetooth, not infared, so it is kind of odd and fun to not have to point it towards the TV or PS3. Sony layout is not real intuitive; need to learn it; for example, ""X"" is the select."
3,"Works well with the PS3, but lacks features","It works well with the PS3 (obviously). The two cons I have for it is that first, it doesn't allow for adjusting TV volume, and it doesn't illuminate. These are two things I grown accustomed to with my XBOX 360 TV remote.But the remote does what its intended to do, control blu-ray playback without the use of the controller."
4,Works Well,This remote does everything it says and it works fine. My one complaint is that there are no indication lights and it is hard to see the buttons on remote in the dark.
4,Where's the on/off button?,I purchased this remote because my controller's battery is shot. I only use the PS3 to watch Blu-ray movies and wanted a way to control the PS3 without a tethered controller. The only problem I have with this remote is that I haven't found a way to turn the playstation 3 on or off with it.
4,Use PS3 for Media? This is a Must Have.,"If you're like me and use PS3 not only for gaming, but for videos and blue-ray, this is a must have. At first I thought ""Oh I can just use my PS3 controller,"" but when I got it on impulse I was extremely satisfied.PROS: Many buttons, including the customizable red, green, blue, and yellow buttons. Blue-tooth is a treat and setting it up is so easy through the PS3 system/accessories menu (""Register BD Controller""). You can also turn on the PS3 with it and use it to scroll through the menus, as it also has the standard buttons that's on the controller. This means you never have to touch your sixaxis/dualshock3 if you only need to use OPS3 for video.CONS: No backlight, which I think should be a MUST HAVE for all controllers and remotes. You can't use it to control games which is sad. I love playing the PSN online poker game and it would be nice to use the remote seeing as how you only use 2 buttons."
5,Good buy.,The remote is much easier to use than the controller. Excellent price compared to local retailers.
4,"Great item, easy to set up, no problem at all.Thanks.","Awesome item, really easy to set up due to the blue-tooth tech.,works nice.I would recomend to anybody to have one of this cause saves a lot of time since you don't need to find any code to program the remote all you have to do is like two step set up and that's it .Thank you."
4,Good remote but could have been better,"I have had this remote for about 6 weeks and it is a good remote for the PS3 as it gives you access to all the blu-ray controls and is better than using the SIXAXIS contoller. It should have included backlighting for the buttons especially since it is a Sony remote for their expensive PS3, come on Sony."
2,Design flaws,"Too many design flaws on this thing. Too easy to turn on the PS3, too difficult to turn off the PS3, and you end up in the PS3 menu unexpectedly.1. No off button. You cannot turn the PS3 off without navigating menus. I end walking up to the PS3 and pressing the 1/0 button on it (which doesn't always work either, since you can't turn off the PS3 right after turning it on).2. Every button is an on button. Press any button and the PS3 turns on.3. While playing a DVD, and the stop button doesn't take you to the DVD top menu, it takes you to the PS3 menu.4. The ""Top Menu"" button takes you to the PS3 menu, unlike every other DVD controller. Instead, you need to press the Pop-Up/Menu button to get the DVD controller."
2,Works - terrible usability,"A must have if you want to watch Blue Ray on your Playstation (since PS3 only uses Bluetooth, not infrared remotes) The layout of the buttons is horrible, the DVD controls are lacking, there's no way to control my Sony TV volume as with ""normal"" Sony DVD remotes. I have Sony everything, yet I still hate this remote (and the fact that I can't program my universal remote to manage my PS3). When will Sony learn - give customers what they want, not what Sony wants. Sony never has been high on usability, but this it one of the worse examples of usability ever for one of their products."
4,Backlight Needed!,"The remote itself is simple enough to operate, and I'm glad it's bluetooth like the controller. Using the PS button to turn the system on and off doesn't bother me much, and setting up the remote took only a minute or two.To me, the major thing this is missing is a backlight or luminescent buttons! When we use the remote it's only to watch a movie, and that's normally in the dark. It's a pain trying to find the pause button if we need to break for any reason, and would make this remote much improved."
2,Disappointing,"The on/off button on the remote does not work to turn on/off my PS3 unit. Disappointing! It seems Sony can no longer be relied upon for product quality control. I have been a 40 year Sony product user over competitors products. I will have to rethink my allegence, not sure if another new product {wireless headphones} I just received is working correctly either again disappointing."
1,The remote didn't work with the PS3,I Was too busy to register the BD remote with the PS3 after I bought it. Finally I got a chance to do it on 10/19/11. I had to call Sony PlayStation to walk me through the process of registering the remote with the PS3 settings. IT DIDN'T WORK !!! Now I stuck with the remote that is not working.
3,Fills in the need of a sumple conventional control,"buy this cause my girl is not much of a PS3 fan, and this one is much more easier to use than the game controller, as this is a conventional type of control. Dont like the fact that if the stop key is pressed by mistake -its in a position where it TENDS to happend- whole movie stop, gets you out to the PS3 interface and takes a while to load back. Even more, it dont have the reminding option, so you have to start searching where you where in the movie, breaking the complete movie flow..This has happend like 3 times, and its pretty lame. Other thing is this control works via Blutooth, so no matching to universal controls or cant be controlled from your receiver."
4,I'm on my third remote but when they work they are perfect!,"I've gone through 2 of these so far and am ordering the 3rd one now. I don't know why these things die, but they do die. The latest one I ordered was in May of 2010 so it lasted until November of this year (6 months) which is pretty lame. The positive is that when it works it's the single most used accessory we have for our PS3."
3,Works well when it works?,The last one I had stopped working after a few months. I like the remote design Ok. and it keeps me from having to get out my Sixaxis controller. i hope this one lasts awhile!Quick delivery and protected well during shipping.
4,Decent remote,"This is a pretty decent product as far as console remotes go. The price is VERY nice compared to the PS2's $40 remote from three years ago. Like everyone else said, you have to update your system to use the remote, but as long as you have broadband its no big deal seeing as Sony's online service is free. If you don't have broadband, then you can download an installer CD and manually upload the update. Its also a very nice upgrade from the controller since just grazing the controller can cause the movie to skip frames and bring up menus. I also just wanted to mention to the person who compared this to the Wiimote that the Wiimote is the console's ACTUAL controller so there is no real comparison between the two."
3,Just Ok,It works. Nothing special. The buttons don't light up in the dark. I am going to ditch it when logitech harmony comes out with a version of remote with bluetooth.
2,Very + + but Very Empty,"If your looking for a book full of positive affirmations then this seems to be the only book of it's kind. All the other books I have looked at seem to all say ""if things are looking bad then..."" this book is more like ""things are good and will only get better"". The problem I found with this book though, is it leaves you feeling empty, since it is written from a 'New Age' point of view, leaving you with no-one to look up to but yourself."
2,Too Old,"I'm sorry but this isn't the best bipolar book, anymore. The material is too outdated to solve my problems. I read and reread the most recent bipolar book I purchased but this one just stays on the shelf. Also, I think it makes bipolar look simple, but we all know what a challenge it is to cope with this condition. And what are this author's credentials to write a book on bipolar? I want a medical expert to tell me about all the choices before I make up my mind."
4,Information source bi-polar,"I bought this so I would understand my daughter's bi-polar better. I found it to be very valuable and informative especially for those who are just finding out about a loved ones bi-polar. Has important information in easy to read language, and has several tables and outlines which I found useful."
3,"I have Bipolar, I'm not A bipolar.","Overall the book was ok but I did not like how the authors would say 'bipolars, your bipolar person, etc.' I am a person with bipolar disorder, not 'A' bipolar. It just kinda ticked me off how she took the fact away that we are still people who happen to suffer from this horrible disorder."
4,Simple survival guide,"David J. Miklowitz brings clear, easy-to-follow plans to this guide to everything about bipolar illness. His definitions are simple and well-illustrated with real scenarios from sufferers of bipolar illness. The book is a worthwhile purchase just for the examples of mood diary cards, but it is full of all sorts of other practical advice in plain language. It is the best, most comprehensive guide I have found. Miklowittz refers to the well-known scientific and clinical studies without bogging down the text, a common problem with even the most well-respected authors of books about bipolar disorder."
2,Not the Best,"Not the best bipolar book out there. You need the most current information. Taming Bipolar, by Psychology Today was more resourceful.Psychology Today: Taming Bipolar DisorderStill, there are other bipolar books more current than this one.Also,Why Am I Still Depressed? Recognizing and Managing the Ups and Downs of Bipolar II and Soft Bipolar Disorderis absolutely wonderful for understanding Mood Spectrum Disorders."
3,The Birth of Dixieland,"If we consider Dixieland as a subset of '20's jazz, with a New Orleans origin, this band is one of the first and probably the most influential. Abbie Brunies (cornet) and Charlie Cordella (clarinet) are remarkable players and are more than ably assisted by other New Orleans stalwarts, including Leon Rapollo.All sides are fine, but the really good ones (Pussy Cat Rag, Barataria, Maple Leaf Rag, Let Me Call You Sweetheart) are available elsewhere. Still, this is good stuff and can be enjoyed for listening as well as history.The sound quality is very good and the album notes are worthwhile. I enjoyed this album very much."
2,A Disappointing Game,"This disk offers both the original Italian version and a dubbed-into-English version; I watched the English version.This movie gives a lot of time to music ""inspired by"" Scarlatti. To my ears these selections were annoying exercises in atonal noodling -- I could not hear the spirit of Scarlatti that was supposedly behind these pieces. There are several of them and they are long.The English version of the interviews is always accompanied by the sound of the original speaker's Italian (or sometimes Spanish), but both voices are equally loud so it's very hard to follow what's being said.Some narration takes place in a marionette theater. The puppet is not in synch with the speaker and often the marionette mouths on after the speaker has finished -- maybe it's different in the Italian version.I would recommend the music of Scarlatti to everyone, but I can not recommend this movie."
1,BLEW UP,"I was cooking a roast and when I opened up the oven door ,The pan Blew up I have glass every where.not to mention the 7 # prime rib was trashed. I am lucky I did not get hurt because it blew all over my kitchen and dining room. Needless to say I won't be using Pyrex again."
1,Wrong part sent,"Buyer beware, they will send you the wrong part {A wire mesh strainer, not shown on this page, that is next to impossible to put on the jar}"
2,"Low quality , overpriced, but they work.","Received two of these last week but one was damaged in shipment. I don't blame the shipper because the plastic was very low quality and it wouldn't take much to damage them.If this were not a niche item, four dollars plus, is way too much to pay, otherwise this should be available at a dollar store, maybe two for a dollar."
5,sprouting strainer lid at Amazon,The sprouting strainer lid is just what I was looking for. I always have sprouts in the making so the extra lids were a bonus.
5,Great Shoes,"These are the most comfortable shoes that I own, great dressed up or casual with slacks and a shirt. Crocodile shoes are a must for any mans waredrobe and this is the pair to own if you want well made, comfortable classic look, just all in all a great shoe!!!"
4,As dramatic as it sounds - this changed my life,"Granted, I was 12 at the time. However, after seeing Adam on MTV, I decided that we should marry and have little ants. While that never came to fruition, I do have to say that in the following two decades, I came to be a semi-expert on his Antness and rate this particular work as one of the better ones. If you're looking for melody and fun (rather than insightful lyrics and innovative guitar play), this album will do you nicely. The opening track, ""Scorpions"" always seemed better live to me, but it kicks off the album with a bang. Favorites on the album include the title track, Picasso et al, and of course ""Stand and Deliver"" - that song alone I believe makes the cd worth owning. If you're looking for 80's indulgence, I think you'll like it."
1,cancelled,we never got these as I cancelled the order. I found nice soft ones at Chicos.they look very nice in the photo
4,Not June Cleaver,"This is a great compliation of essays about women during the 1950s who did not fit the idealized ""feminine mystique"" of the housewife. Joanne Meyerowitz's essay responding to Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" is particularly interesting and reavealing. Meyerowitz conducted thourough research and came to the conclusion that the media, while celebrating domesticity, simultaniously applauded women who acheived in politics, careers, volunteer work and other areas outside the home. The book includes sections on Chinese American women and their arrival after the second world war, the brutal murder of Emmett Till, women labor activists, nurses, and education. It is comprehensive and highly historical, but easy and interesting for non-reasearchers to read."
2,"Not Bad, but .....","I bought this CD mainly for the song I'll fly with you, by Gigi D'Agostino (which was unfortunately the 3 minute version instead of the longer version that we're used to hearing in clubs & on the radio) most of the songs fall short this way, if your used to hearing these songs in clubs, this is more like a sample CD than a full compilation......"
5,spiffy cd,"I work in a music store and everytime one of the songs on this cd comes on we sell atleast 2 copies...it's easy to dance to and great to listen to...great remixes of songs I wouldn't typically like...and then there's Faithless' song ""We Come 1"" need I say more...that is a great song!"
2,If You Don't Listen to Dance Music,"If you don't listen to dance music, but want to hear some of the more mainstream tracks of the last 2 years, you might want to pick this up. Anyone who has visited a club or bought a CD by a true club artist such as System F or Ian Van Dahl will find all of these tracks a bit on the overplayed side. Who hasn't heard Sandstorm or Silence hundreds of times by now?Some of these tracks aren't really dance, too. I challenge you to dance to Dido or Moby's ""Southside"", because it simply won't happen with a song whose bpm must struggle to hit triple digits."
1,What a load of garbage,"It's compilations like these that gives dance music a bad name. I would love to rescue Faithless' ""We Come 1"" and Delerium's ""Silence"" from this pile of garbage. ""Totally Dance"" is the Now! This is Music version of dance music. I do not want to dance to the stuff of Pink and Dream. I am already sick and tired of listening to Dido's ""Thank You"", what makes the record company who churned out this turkey that I would want to hear a remix of a song I'm sick of? This comp is such a joke."
5,UNDER-RATED,"Survivor is the most under-rated band in history. Ask most people who they are and you get the same response. They sang Eye of the Tiger. However, that wasn't the only song they ever sang!! These guys were true American rock, before the age of MTV. Bands who write and play their own music are always higher on my list. Jim Peterik's song writing was awesome and Frankie Sullivan's guitar playing was perfection. I agree they were better with Dave Bickler, but I think it was more because that time period was their original music when they were new and fresh. Over time, the well of great tunes seems to dry up, it happens to everyone."
1,plastic is plastic,"I tried this in my woodworking shop. It was great at first, then the cover fell off the dial, then the hand fell off the dial. For a few dollars more(not counting what I wasted on this junk) I bought stainless steel, still going strong. This tool violates the rule that all General(R) tools are great."
1,Mike M.,"Amazon should have a Zero Star rating, because this is what this deserves. Bought one at the local hardware store, took it out of the package, and the gear for the dial immediately started skipping. Took it right back for a refund, and will be looking for something better. There is NO WAY that you can get any accuracy off of this thing. The dial is worthless. Don't bother wasting the money, just go out and get one that is made of stainless steel. Too much plastic on this thing with little quality control."
2,Not very good quality,"I know Nintendo Micros are out-dated, and accessories for them are hard to come by, but this set is not worth the money. The only thing worthwhile is the car charger, and I'm hoping it holds up because it looks cheesy. The game holder fell apart just trying to open it. The earphones are extremely uncomfortable, and the carrying case, although sturdy, is a pain to zip and unzip. The plastic cover for the micro attracts dirt and isn't tactile friendly. Spend a little more and get a better product."
5,fun and factual,"I gave this book as a gift to a friend in New York City who just became engaged and it was perfect. It's sophisticated, well-written and fun. I took a few minutes to read thru it and it has some fun facts. The colors, design and layout are very pleasing to the eye which I liked much better than any of the other ""kissing"" books."
1,Disappointing,"I heard an interview with the author on NPR and so became interested in this book. I thought it was going to give a scientific explanation of how the kiss developed and an anthropological history of what is truly a pleasureable but unusual behavior. When I finally purchased it and started to read it, I found it silly and lacking any real information."
5,Apple Powerbook Adapter,I am very pleased with the item. I had a hard time finding it at Apple. This type of adapter has a tendency to break easy but it is the only one available for the Powerbook G4. I was very happy with the price of the item. Thank you!
2,This is misleading,"The product description says:""Original Brand New Apple Laptop AC Adapter with New Power Cord.""To me that means it should come with the white square power brick and the white cord that hooks the power brick into the wall. When my order arrived, it contained the power brick but the cord included was black and clearly not made by apple. The black cord fits the power adapted however it does not complete the ""sqaure"" of the powerbrick. This whole thing was very misleading and now I see why it was so cheap. Buyer beware. I should have bought the official replacement from apple. My mistake."
2,same as original,"needed a replacement for apples original adapter. built to break at the connection to the Ibook - have heard this many many times from unhappy apple users ... the plug is my only complaint about apple, but I needed a replacement and had to fork out the dough...."
1,"Didn't fit, didn't light, didn't work","Big Mistake buying a non Apple AC adapter. Ended up wasting time. Good that thereturn policy worked. This adapter does not fit well, has no light to indicate if it is workingand does not work reliably. Don't waste your time on it though it may seem cheap, it'll turnout to be a pain."
2,DOES NOT FIT THE EXTENSION CORD!!!,"Ok, this piece is only the square with the part that connects to your computer. I was aware of that when I purchased it, but I was not aware that the extension part that I add to my apple charger would not attach to the square part of this charger. Soooo, it is on a VERY short leash, which is very irritating because you practically have to hug the outlet. The cord is literally 40 inches, which is not a lot of slack."
2,Button type alnico magnets from General Tools,"The button type alnico magnets from General Tools I purchased were a disappointment for 3 reasons. One magnet was so weak, it is functionally useless for much of anything. The three other magnets will be used, but they do not provide the holding power for general use in how I planned to use them. Magnets lose their magnetism and become so weak, I just can't hold them up as magnets. Get it?"
3,Hal Leonard Traditional Music,"As best as I can tell, this is the biggest in print Irish music compelation. Some of the tunes are written in odd keys, but there don't seem to be too many typos. I'm a little offended by what I found on the title page:""For all works contained herein: Unauthorized copying, arranging, adapting, recording or public performance is an infringement of copyright. Infringers are liable under the law.""Who knew the Hal Leonard corporation held a copyright on traditional music?"
1,Sighting Rest,"This Hyskore Sighting Rest is not the quality I was seeking, but my own fault I looked at price over the features. I would have returned the product but UPS wanted $25.00 shipping. The rest takes too long to setup and adjust. Just not a good designed sighting rest."
5,Excellent soundtrack to an excellent movie,"James Horner really delivers a great soundtrack to this underrated and often overlooked movie, starring Kurt Russell, Ray Liotta, and Madeleine Stowe. The symphonic music is gripping and lures you in immediately, just like how the movie itself achieves this. This soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks I own. The eight tracks are as follows:1. Main Title2. Intruder3. Being Watched4. Leon's Death5. Drug Bust6. Bail Denied7. Pete's Passion8. End CreditsI find that when I listen to each individual track, I know exactly what scene in the movie the track appears in, without looking at the titles of the tracks. This is excellent symphonic movie soundtrack music that keeps you interested and provides a sort of dark mood. This CD is over 35 minutes long. For anybody who has seen the movie and likes it, this is a soundtrack that I highly recommend."
4,Useful information if one using Neural Nets.,"This work, ..., is very useful to those of us who are setting up trading systems based on Neural Nets or using other Cybernetic techniques. Yes the writing style may not be the best, but this does not take away from the high quality of the technical material, which is what is really important.Mr Jurik has some very interesting Low-Lag technical indicators available on his web site....If you are attempting to design a profitable trading system which uses technical analysis for Stock or Futures trading, this book should be on your shelf."
3,Its okay,I found this cd as somewhat helpful. I just synch it onto my computer so I could create a childrens yoga cd and only used about 3 songs.
5,Loved Loved Loved This Book!!,"Let me say this, .... it will be a long time before I complain again about how hard my life is! I don't know how women lived to the ripe ages some of them did? Orlean was a tiny woman with a big spirit. She overcame more trials and tribulations ... as most pioneer women did ... then I can imagine happening in our time. If you like history about real pioneer life, midwivery, hard times and perservering through it all, this is the book for you!"
4,Good informaion,I have knee injuries and arthritis as a result. I am always looking for ways to understand my limitations and work with what I've got. This book is very helpful.
4,Wanting more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great CD! The CD was recommend to me by a friend while visiting Lincoln, NE and I have been listening to it non-stop! The music isn't the boring stuff you normally hear on most Christian radio, but the lyrics are definitely Christian and will move you! 'Immaculate Perception' is a one of a kind song that really puts things in perspective, if you are ever depressed. Even us ""solid"" Christians need a reminder of God's love and hope. My only disappointment with this CD is that I wish there were MORE of these wonderful songs! Keep writing, James, and I hope you release another CD!"
5,A great book for a silent vaction.,"In October, I was spending my vacation in Sweden and Denmark. Before my trip I ran across this book and thought it would be interesting. I was spending some time in Scandinavia and wanted to read something with a different view of the world-so why not a Scandinavian author?Upon my second night in Sweden I began reading this book. I was suprised at how the story pulled me deeper into the book. Sometimes the book seemed complex; but the story flowed so well. It's now January and I still think about this book!This book was a great find. I hope the US publishers will print more of his books. If they don't, Mr. Grndahl's books have been translated into German and many other languages; so I will just read the others in German.While in Copenhagen, I made sure my friends bought the book as well for their holiday in India. This was the only English book by the author I found while in Copenhagen."
3,not all that its cracked up to be but still good!,"After reading review after review claiming this book was absolutely fabulous and a must have, I had to get it. After reading it I can certainly say that it was a steamy read with lost of twists an turns, I could not put this book down! BUT its not 5 star material. The plot, while good could certainly have been better and hold more substance and at times the dialogue was really cheesy which is a real pet-peeve for me . This is not a bad read at all, in fact it is quite enjoyable but in no way is it 5 stars worthy."
5,I loved it!,"MoneyShot is an exciting book to read from start to finish. We follow extensive character development of Alan `Nick' Nichols as he goes through a mid life crisis.MoneyShot is a demonstration of how a person's life can change unexpectedly for the better. We see Nick's transition from a boring and unfulfilled advertising executive, husband and father to an impulsive man gambling away his future a la Vegas style.Very easy to read and with a witty dialogue, I couldn't put it down till I finished reading it. The only fault I found with the book was that it had to end. Write more Brian Rouff! I loved it."
2,LEAST ESSENTIAL ROCK CROSSOVER,"Rock bands teaming with orchestras: By now everyone from Metallica (on S&M) to The Moody Blues (all summer, every summer at mid-sized civic centers across the land) has given it a try, usually with less-than-inspiring results. So it would be easy enough to ignore Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson teaming up with the Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt, if it weren't for one thing: There's absolutely nothing novel about a flautist playing with an orchestra. Anderson admits as much in the album's surprisingly cranky liner notes. He also admits that past pairings haven't gone so well: ""Having had the odd show when the High School Band of Dumbsquat College, Upper Delaware-on-the-lake would have done better, I relax and rejoice when we get a good and dedicated orchestra who will work hard to find that special something which brings it all alive for musicians and audience alike."" The relentlessly dull album, however, is likely to result in too much relaxing and not enough rejoicing."
5,best book for graduate QM course,This is the best book for first graduate QM course. Why? I think the reason is that it is written completely with bra and ket notation. Sakurai starts with the introduction of why bra and ket are invented in order to describe QM phenomena. It inherits essential of Dirac's QM and Feynmann's undergraduate series Vol.3 (QM) and extends It with a modern view. The readable volume is also a merit. strongly recommended!
5,Fabulous Book and Series,"We (my son 10, husband 41, myself 43) love the series. My son actually cried when we finished the last book. He can't believe he will not read more about Fireheart and the cat clans! He said it like loosing a good friend. The books were action packed and added alot to think about and discuss.My son can't wait for the movie and hopefully more about the cats of the forest!"
4,Fire or foul,"I think this book deserved 4 stars because........It was a thrilling, grabbing story. I think it should of had less blood."
4,Good overview of daily life in late-15th-century England,"The ""Yorkist"" period of English history is often overlooked---it's overshadowed, in many peoples' minds, by the more spectacular eras of Henry V before it, and the Tudors afterward. However, a lot of what the Tudors did was to build on the foundations laid at this time, and much of what came to fruition under the Tudors was started under their predecessors."
5,RN caduceus charm,This was a gift for a special new RN. I have one and she now is enjoying hers. The service was excellent and prompt and packaged nicely.
1,"Be careful what you order, measure twice buy once.","Bought this as a repair item and have broken it during installation, my own fault. I knew it was a tight fit and the ferrul was not the correct size any way. I was just trying to make it work instead of returning it, duh. My tube is about 1 3/8 inch dia and this switch is about 1/64 inch too tall. I tapped it in anyway but then found I did not have enough threads sticking out to attach nut. Removal was deadly to switch.Good luck to others who buy, I will be looking locally. Switch height is about 1 25/64 inch. Ferrul is 1/4 inch dia."
2,Couldn't use it,Don't know if the switch worked or not. The knob seemed to be glued on; couldn't remove it by any means without destroying the switch.
2,"Wayward then, wayward now.","This is a self-serving story written by a egotistical, ill-disciplined, manipulative, spoilt bully, out of touch with reality and with no empathy or sympathy - except for himself. And no credible evidence of remorse."
3,"Good, but not great","As someone who has spent considerable time reading about OMG's and getting to know some of the people who ride with them, I can honestly say this book could have been more in depth and more revealing, had the author chosen that route. However, he doesn't reveal anything that most people who are educated on OMG's don't already know. Also, the book really doesn't offer anything up to date on where the author is now and what he's been doing with his life since writing this book. A much better inside look at OMG's is offered in more recent books, most notably UNDER AND ALONE by William Queen. For folks who aren't acqainted with the one percenter lifestyle, this book might be informative, but for those of us who are, it was just more of the same."
1,Lousy Book,Most boring biker book I've ever read. Reads more like a day to day police report. Don't waste your money...there are a lot of better one out there.
2,Try for a better copy,"I bought this copy some time back and was very disappointed to find it crammed in the disc. The first part giving the title, actors and actress were cut out and at the end the simbolic showing of the white horse was also edited. This is a great movie thats hard to find and should have been presented in it's full original form. Keep checking for a better copy than this Asian copy."
1,keep fishing for a better book,This book is pile of garbage it might have taken all of a weekend to put together. The actual amount of data in this book could fit on an 8x11 sheet of paper. Miserable waste of money.
3,Not quite as advertised.,"My cat likes this, but I'm rather peeved that it isn't actually a two-hour video as advertised. It's the same shorter piece repeated several times, which would be okay if it was just the birds/critters repeating, but they left in the title sequence with talking and a stupid commercial for a cat toy. I won't be buying any more videos made by this company."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a big fan of Laura Kinsale, but this book was very disappointing. The story wasn't that great and the love scenes weren't just beyond pornographic - they were degrading to the heroine. Save your money for a better book."
4,I recently read Philip Roth did not like this movie...,"but I thought it captured the book quite well. Poor Richard Benjamin, he was soooooo good at playing the slimey characters, wasnt he? This and Diary of a Mad Housewife....This is not as funny as the book, to me, the scene in the book of Portnoy in the family bathroom was hysterical and a stand out, it was humorous in the movie but not laugh out loud. However, it is a captivating movie and if you, like I do, LOVE Karen Black, then this is the movie to see. She is so talented and gorgeous, at first I thought, is she playing her role from Five Easy Pieces, but no, she is not. This is a raunchy, sexist, angry movie and sadly ( like the book ) so disparaging of Jewish women, but yet I really enjoyed it.Funny, Karen Black playing a so called shiksa in the movie when actually her heritage is Jewish. She was busting the stereotype right there! Good girl!"
2,AMEN......,"Well it starts out well enough, but it became a morman recrutment pamplet. I think Mr. Card is one of the best writers I've read, but everybody has a bad day. I do think you should give it a shot, it does have some interesting thoughts ,and if you like Mr. Card, that's part of the reason you buy his stuff."
2,"slow, boring, implausible","World War III has occurred and America blames it all on - who else - those pesky Mormons! Mormons?!!! The least Card could've done is offer an explanation why. It would have been a little more believable if the scapegoats were Jews or Muslims (although Card can't be held responsible for not incorporating the dynamics of a post 9/11 world back in the 80's when he wrote it).After introducing the scapegoats, Card proceeds to drag us through four or five different stories about Mormons fighting for survival in a hostile world. I suppose it's fascinating if you're a Mormon, otherwise skip it."
2,Not her best work,"It seems like I waited forever for this book to come out, and now that I read it, I wish she maybe had spent more time developing it. It was predictible, boring, and disapointing. Read it if you are desperate."
3,DON'T BUY THE AUDIO TAPE,"I really liked the book. The only thing I would like to see changed is let us know on the end who is plotting against who instead of in the begining.After reading the book I usually buy the tape to listen to the story again and again. Well, I am sorry I bought this tape. It had none of the mystery plotting. That was the essence of the book. The story was bland without it. Johanna, how could you let them destory your book. I like the way you tell a story but not the dry way the audio tape told it."
1,Not so good,"I used to enjoy reading Johanna Lindsey's books, but the quality of her writing seems to have declined in recent works. I found this story to be poorly written and I struggled to finish it."
1,Boring,Oh my gosh I was never so glad to be finished with a book. I kept wanting Millisant to stop whining and grow up. And the broken foot thing I didn't understand that.She wore her shoe for a year so her foot would heal and she never told him or anyone ?The whole story was fragmented and pointless.
2,Not equal to previous books,"Unsual women and great plots are the hallmark of Johanna Lindsey's writing. In the ""Joining"" Ms. Lindsey has fallen from her usual standards. She also is in the ""authentic spelling"" syndrome many good authors seem to be dabbling in. Using the ""Olde English"" names for characters only brings confusion. Yet, this is not the true flaw of this selection. Here the author uses the essence of a previous work of her's ""Tender Rebel"". With the Malory books Ms. Lindsey is an author without equal. But with the ""Joining"" she has given her readers a predictable plot, uninteresting characters and a book I could wait to finish. Every author has an off selection. I'm certain many readers will love this work, I however, didn't. I hope her next selection will be up to her previous excellence."
3,Not what I expected,"I was an avid fan of Johanna Lindsey's some years back, and loved just about every book she wrote. So I had pretty high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, they weren't realized. There was little of the ""tension"" you expect to find between the main characters in an historical romance, and therefore, the story wasn't as good as expected. Further, the characters weren't developed to the point where you could actually care about them. The female character's dislike of the male character was shallow, childish, and thus hard to accept as the main reason for keeping the two apart. And why the male character fell for the female is not known to me since her redeeming qualities were not demonstrated sufficiently. Rather than go on with my disappointments, I will say, it was a decent read, but nothing up to Lindsey's typical standards. Check it out from the library if you want to read it; but wait for a better book if you have some money to spend."
2,"Okay, but not the best from Johanna Lindsey!","The book was slow, and more drawn out than the others that I have read by her. The only reason I read the whole thing was because I know her writing and I figured it had to get better... it didn't."
2,Not Up To Par!!,"I usually love JL's books. However, I was very disappointed in this one. I found it to be slow with a very predictable ending. Also, several characters are introduced and then just seem to disappear. What was their purpose?"
1,Sleeping through Dawn,"This book was a sleeper. There was not a lot of action for you action lovers. This book was made up of memeories and thoughts. Nothing happened. It did however make the reader think what is right or wrong. But if a reader is wanting drama or action, not thinking, then find another book."
4,"Disturbing, powerful story","This book was recommended to me as a sequel to Night. If you're looking for a traditional sequel in Dawn, you'll probably be disappointed. Dawn is a sequel to Night in that it reveals another chapter in the life of the Jewish community that survived the Holocaust. Weisel raises serious questions of right and wrong by placing a Holocaust survivor ""on the other side of the gun."" If you like struggling with difficult moral/ethical issues, this book would be a great choice. If you like the different aspects of the Jewish experience of the Holocaust, you'll also want to read The Accident, the third book in the Night Trilogy."
5,Coolest toy in the entire world!!!!!,"This is the most awesome thing in the world. EVERYONE should buy it! It is safe, yet SO SO COMPELTELY FUN."
5,Beautiful Romance,"One of my all time favorites. The hero has gone off to war and returns home to find that his fiance has had a child by another man. He remains in the betrothal for honor's sake while devastated and despising the heroine. But he cannot help falling in love with her again. Meanwhile danger lurks on all sides as they and all their friends deal with the fallout of the Jacobite rebellion in 1745.This is very well written and your heart will break for both the hero and the heroine and the little boy. Some of the most endearing secondary characters I have ever read. Very good feel for the times and an intricate plot that plays out over several novels. Ms. Veryan is a master of the winding plot that passes from couple to couple over several books without any confusion or odd contrivance.The romance between these two is beautiful and some of the scenes absolutely heartwrenching. No explicit love scenes here. If you like emotion in your love stories, this one is for you."
4,Good stuff,Oomph's music and lyrics seem to mature as the band progresses. This is the best of all I've heard.
1,Can't keep up!,"This tape has been sitting at the bottom on my exercise bin for awhile. Every so often, I'll pull it out and try it again. But it moves WAY too fast, with little or no cueing, for anyone to follow what is going on, let alone break a sweat! Not a good workout..."
1,Skip this video,"The choreography in this video was far too complicated. I have been doing aerobics for over five years and consider myself to be fairly coordinated, but the steps in this video were very complex even for experienced aerobicizers. The instructor seldom gives you the cues to when the foot pattern changes and more than half the time she is moving on to a new step while I'm still trying to figure out the current step.The camera angles didn't help either as those would change to show the instructor from the waist up just when you thought you had the complex foot maneuvers figured out. The instructor tells you to pay attention to the changes, but doesn't tell you what those are. VERY FRUSTRATING!Skip this video and try Kathy Smith's Latin workout instead. She is a much better instructor and gives you cues when you need them."
2,Hard to Keep up,If you have never taken a Latin Dance class this video is not for you I guess the instructer is under the usumption that you know what you were doing I did not even finish the video I was so confused and fustrated. Save your money this video is not worth it.
1,another book about the kitschmeister,"If you've ever wondered whether Robert Hughes is right about Schnabel, the reproductions in the book will show you he is."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I was impressed with this book but there was something missing from it. I usually love the ""Ax"" books but there was something wrong with it. Maybe it's because Applegate started to get more interested in her other series but the corny sense of humor that Ax has was gone. I was shocked with the way he reacted when he found out the Cassie let Tom walk off with the morphing cube. While we're on the subject, I didn't like that part of the series. What Cassie did was just plain dumb. You know, I can understand why she didn't let Jake kill Tom, but why didn't she get him herself? I may have lost some of you, but if you read THe Ultimate, you'll understand.This is definately a must-read in the Animorph series, but that's just because of the plot."
3,Panasonic ES8078S,"This is my second Vortex shaver. My last one lasted only about one and a half years before giving problems, poor shave very noisy and erratic motor speed. At first they give a great shave which is why I have bought the same shaver again, probably the best shave I have ever had and I have tried Remington and Braun before. I had always used the cleaning system but still ran into problems with performance. Even with this new shaver I feel that I get better performance if I do not use the cleaning system but follow their advice for the alternative cleaning method. In short, great shave don't expect it to last though."
5,Seems like a great value,"Three years ago I bought the Panasonic ES8152NC from Amazon, and I raved about it in my review. Well, I didn't buy the ES7058 from Amazon but I got it for a similar price and thought you would want to know that 3 years on these shavers are quieter, even better looking than before, give a closer and quicker shave, are even easier to clean...and all for around fifty notes."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this to replace my Norelco three blade rotary razor. I never used this type of razor and have read its better and smother for sensitive skin so I decided to give it a try. When I first turned it on (at 4:30am) my dog went crazy barking which woke the wife. It's has a high pitch buzzing which is much louder than the Norelco. It is smoother on the skin only because it doesn't cut very well (except for the crack of my mouth when I tried to get shave close). It's hard to maneuver around the mouth and under the nose and leaves a considerable amount of uncut hair, especially on the neck. I have no opinion on the self cleaning. I guess it works but so did pulling the head off my Norelco and running under the water in the sink. I was excited after reading reviews on this razor however after using it for about a month I can now say I am very disappointed and am considering pulling out the old Norelco."
3,Good enough for the price.,"I purchased this kit and the 6 snap refill kit for a small project (I needed 10).After getting about five snaps on, I noticed the tool was deforming. Instead of neatly flaring the insert, it was smashing it. The more I did, the worse the tool got.I was able to finish the 10 snaps, but I wouldnt use this tool for many more.If you want something you can use over and over, spend more money and get something that can take repeated use. If, like me, you wanted something cheap that you can use for one project, this kit is for you. Just don't expect to get more than ~10 snaps out of the tool."
2,Hated this thing,"Directions were suspect at best, did not work for me at all, and overall I kind of watching to smash my head in after trying to use this thing."
2,"Beware contains lead, not good for light fabrics.",Per package contains <5% lead - but there's still lead which can cause birth defects. Also it's not good on light weight fabrics as the snaps are pretty robust.
3,Good Idea...BUT,"Good idea but if the person using it has no manual dexterity, like my mother-in-law, it's of no use. She cannot manipulate the velcro straps that attach it to the arms of the chair. It's also too heavy for her to lift on and off the chair. Like I said, ""Good idea...BUT"". I had to send it back."
5,very interesting reading,"PRIVATE EYES is a book designed to present to the general public the full range of what private investigation is all about. It features interviews with top private detectives who are especially skilled in a particular field ... and it reveals the techniques used in investigating their cases.The areas covered by the authors include chapters on surveillance work, going undercover, using public records, doing interviews, using high-tech listening devices, working with the police andfederal and state agencies. As the book points out, much of private investigative work is based on a patient, plodding, nuts-and-bolts approach. Domestic and romantic disputes, industrial espionage, labor unrest and white collar crime are only a few of the matters addressed to private investigators. No other book has presented this much detailed information in one volume."
4,Great but incredibly expensive!!!!,"... fortunately for me, a silly guy left it in the nearest secondhand cd-shop for 7 Euro, here in Fuengirola (Spain)!Bowie in Multichannel is just Super Bowie (but keep in mind the majority of the Sacd'ed albums are only stereo, apart from this one and Reality... For the luckiest ones who found Heathen in SACD, have fun!"
5,An essential key to understanding Islamic arts and civilization,"Every college-level collection strong in either Middle Eastern Studies or Middle Eastern art must have ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY: it's a specialty item for the serious holding which offers the first reference work on Arabic script. Calligraphy is one of the foundation arts of Islamic culture and has been a primary method of artistic expression from the 7th century to modern times, so it well deserves its own book and is anything but the 'esoteric art' Westerners might believe. Over 150 color illustrations and over a hundred black and white details come from dated examples to provide insights on everything from construction and history to identifying forgeries and understanding differing styles. An essential key to understanding Islamic arts and civilization, this reference is not to be missed.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,worth the money,"This book is well organized and easy to use. It is written for NON health professional, so is good for a home reference, or for patient education."
2,VERY BASIC.... VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"As a government employee, I bought this book hoping it would provide some good tips on the federal retirement system. This book may help the new or very uninformed employee, but that's it. Some of the information on government benefits was just plain wrong, which is why it only gets two stars from me. As an example, it states a FERS employee can contribute a maximum of 10% to the Thrift Savings Plan each year. Wrong! An employee has been able to contribute 15% for years and I believe there is no limit in 2006. This is not good information for a book that was updated in February 2006!"
3,Sony DSC-S50 CyberShot Digital Camera,"As mentioned in previous reviews, if you want higher resolution pictures, the 4 MB or 8 MB memory sticks are not adequate. I could only get 4 pictures on the 4 MB memory stick. You are now able to purchase a 64 MB memory stick, which will be much better for long trips and using the movie function.The pictures look great on-line, but you have to have a good printer to go along with the camera if you expect to print pictures.The information available at the Amazon.com site regarding how to select a camera is very helpful and explains a great deal of information that the will not be readily available at your local computer store selling digital camers."
1,Unable to overcome my procrastination issues.,"This book has been sitting on my shelf for several years, but I've never read it because I procrastinate to much. Buying this book was a horrible idea."
5,Rsm,These grommets and tool kit worked very well.I installed the grommets on privacy mesh to bolt it to some posts to build a fence and I'm pleased with how well they worked.
2,LOVE CAMP.,"THIS FILM WAS BOUGHT THINKING IT WAS THE JESS FRANCO COMPLETE EDITION BUT I WAS WRONG.IT INVOLVES A CULT WHO PROFESS FREE LOVE AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.LAURA GEMSER IS THE DIVINE ONE WHICH IS OK AT A STRETCH BUT THIS EVOLVES INTO A PSYCHEDELIC,HIPPIE ,YEAH MAN LOT OF OLD TOSH.IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN ONE AFTERNOON AND THEY STILL HAD TIME FOR TEA.ABSOLUTE TOSH LEAVE WELL ALONE."
5,They Say/I Say is a smart and satisfying book.,"Graff and Birkenstein have written the best book about academic writing I've read. Itsstrategies, or moves, extend way beyond the purely academic to all kinds of non-fiction writing and have been put to rigorous classroom tests both by the authors and by many of their peers. They Say/I Say is also a pleasure to read: Graff and Birkenstein practice the very writing lessons they're advocating, so that the book becomes a testimonial to itself, and to the wisdom of its own teachings. Even the interior design of They Say/I Say is pleasing and helps to convey the book's message."
3,It's all questions now. . . .,"I believe the song that Kilmer was playing at the piano was Chopin's Valse Opus 64 no. 2, however I cannot fully confirm this as Broughton and co. has saw fit to leave this off of the soundtrack. What a pity, most of his compilations are usually complete.If anyone is aware of the Chopin piece, please be nice and email me."
4,not as good as I'd hoped,"The Dermalogica skin care line was recommended to me by a licensed esthetician. She warned me about online ""imposters"" using dermalogica packaging but selling an inferior product. I've never run into that before. I purchased the large bottle of Active Moist through Pink Lady Super Store because it was cheaper, but this one is thicker and creamier...not as nice as other bottles I've received from other companies selling through Amazon. My face broke out a little when I began using it. Of course, I can't prove anything...I will continue using this product in the future, because my complexion has improved A LOT since using Dermalogica products, but I won't buy from this company again."
1,Disturbing,"I found the scene with the ferret killing the rabbit very disturbing. That part was unnecessary and cruel, and it appeared that it was really a ferret killing a rabbit and not some special effect. I can't believe the people making this movie did such a disgusting thing. For that reason, I'm only giving this one star.Also, the story line itself was terrible and depressing. Ingrid Bergman is beautiful and her acting was great in this movie, but the movie itself was a failure, in my opinion."
3,Vivid Writing Style Livens Up A Mediocre Story,"What most impressed me about this novel was how believable the characters and situations were, such that it read like an autobiography more than something someone just made up and put together into a novel. Merkin's prose is effective and enchanting."
1,Skip it,"I bought it for boat canvass. Wrong choice, poor quality, not sturdy. Made more for light clothing. The tool work good though and I use it with good snaps I got from the boat dealer."
1,"Returned numerous times - on every one, the display shorts out.","This product does not work. We returned it numerous times and every one had the same problem. We would plug it in and turn it on. After a short time (5 seconds to 1 minute), the display would blank out and not come back on. None of the buttons would respond either.The problem would only happen with the plug. When I removed the plug and used batteries, it would work without problem. But, even if I left the batteries in, it would die shortly after plugging it in. This wasn't an acceptable solution because I wasn't going to run through batteries all the time.We tried the DD50 and the LDD50 - both had the same problem."
4,A real page turner.,"This was the second book by Nora Roberts that I read. I loved this book, because it kept my attention from the first page to the very end of the book. This book made me want to quit my job and hunt for treasures hidden at sea. This book is good for those who love a good adventure."
2,Inaccurate Astrology Description of the Bad Guy...,"I enjoyed the book, especially in view of the fact that REAL treasure hunter, Mel Fisher died recently in Key West. What attracted me to your book was HIS own quest as I knew him personally and this seemed to be the only novel on treasure hunting that was recently published. As a practicing astrologer, for nearly 30-years it always gets me nuts when an author doesn't do her homework,however. Aquarius is NOT a water sign, but an air sign - the symbol for the pitcher of water is meaning- less. The ""bad guy"" fit a more dark side of a Taurus man; they do like material things and gold would mean that having Leo Rising would have been a more appropriate. fit. Mel was a Leo and a very kind, gentle, generous man. A sensitive man. I was honored to have known him. Even for a famous novelist,""facts"" can make it even better reading, so if you're going to use astrological terms, get them RIGHT! Carole Hemingway"
5,The audio version was a delight!,"One of Nora Roberts good ones. The audio version, read by Sandra Burr, was time well spent in the car. The rich character studies enlivened the story about star-crossed lovers whom fate keeps bringing back together for a common purpose. After 8 years, they find themselves again working the same dangerous underwater salvage operation, one that would eventually bring them great wealth, international fame and the return of a nagging villian. The good guys finally win, but not without a good fight. And a long-dead Angelique finds just revenge for her curse and peace for her spirit. Good adventure story."
3,"Starts of great, then dies.","I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb. But this was my first ""regular"" Roberts book. The Reef started out wonderfully with the underwater murder of Matthew Lassiter's father. Bringing Uncle Buck and Matthew together with amateur treasure hunters, Ray and Marla Beaumont, and their gorgeous daughter, Tate was terrific. I couldn't put the book down. I loved the intrigue, the heartbreak of Matt and Tate. But after their initial break-up, when they see each for the first time in years, the story (their relationship, the mystery of the evil Silas VanDyke) petered out. I really wanted to like this book more. Will definitely sample another Roberts' book, though."
3,Just short of satisfying,"The first half of this book had me really enthusiastic. Then Tate and Matthew were apart for all those years, and their reunion was not only less than realistic but had most of the initial spark missing. You never really knew why these 2 characters were together to begin with, except that they were the only 2 young people in the story. Fizzled out from a promising beginning."
3,Search for mystery,"This one appeals to those romance readers who are also interested in deep sea treasure hunts. It is an interesting read and keeps you turning the pages. Enjoyable, fun, light reading and if you like scuba diving and buried treasure, you will probably like it. Romance too, of course!"
2,Disappointed Roberts Fan,"The Reef is definitely NOT her best, compared to Ms. Roberts earlier stories. I wonder if Ms. Roberts is not just doing a ""edit and replace"" with her latest books -- same characters, personalities, scenes, etc. I so much enjoyed her earlier books, such as Montana Sky, Villa, The Quinn Brothers Series (my personal favorite). My advise is to pick another book from this prolific author."
3,My Opinion,I heard the one song on my radio station here and new it was old but I really liked it. I love the sounds of Tibetian type chants and this song had that to me. I love Catholic chanting but I am not Catholic. Just enjoyed the song I did like and a couple others.
5,My first exposure to Enigma will not be my last,"I ignored the numerous suggestions to buy Enigma til I found LSD in a used record store. The price was good and I figured I had nothing to lose. Wow--did I get a good deal! The CD is amazing, the music's varied and I get a good taste of what I should have bought long ago. I really can't add more to the excellent reviews already in place, but if you love world and fusion type music, you need to give this CD a try--and yes, it's worth full price."
5,It's great!,"This is a wonderful album! The mood is set in the first song, so you can tell the feeling just by hearing the first song. The album has many of the classic favorites like Return to Innocence, or Gravity of love. If you are a new Enigma fan I reccomend you get this Album so that you can hear their great songs!"
3,Nice Collection bad sound quality.,This CD has a great collection of enigma songs. But the sound quality really is very bad.
5,Just perfect...,"Just perfect. Music is very, very nice. I love ENIGMA. You think that all songs are the same but you are wrong. It is some of energy that you can be given after horrible day at work, for example. I recommend to all of You."
1,Not worth it,Bought this thinking it would speed up a project of mine with about a thousand staples to remove. This is actually less efficient than the flathead screwdriver I had previously been using to remove the staples.
3,Strange spots after boiling water for the first ime,"Update:Some very light spots are still there, but they don't bother me and I am now pretty happy with the pot.Original review:I am not picky about cookware - I often buy pots etc from Marshals, Ross. So initially I was super happy when I received this saucepan - it felt like it was pretty high quality. But after I boiled water there for the first time, I saw some strange spots on the bottom - they look weird, I wonder if the surface was damaged somehow. It's the first time smth like this happened to the new pot/saucepan.. I'll call Cuisinart to see whether they think there is some defect.."
5,Nice Lil Pot,"I bought this little saucepan to replace an existing 1.5 Qt Cuisinart pot that had started to leak at point where the handle connect to the main pot.It looks nice, cleans nicely, the top fits better than the pot it replaced making it quite suitable for cooking rice. It is probably the most frequently used pot in the house."
5,Excellent construction and balance,"This saucepan is exactly as advertised. It is well balanced and the lid fits well, just as good as the All Clad pans I have."
5,cuisinart multiclad 1.5 quart,"great looking pan and just what i had been looking for in a stainless steel. of course you can not walk off and leave them, but for someone who likes to cook they are GREAT"
5,Great for Candy and Regular Cooking,"I'm very happy with this pot. It is very heavy and circulates heat very well. I've used it to make candy and there are no burn spots in the candy and it cleans up very well. It's rolled lip pours soups and jellies easily. When food gets stuck, a little water and a reheat and it comes right off."
1,Not good for regular gaming.,"This headset is exclusive for NFL head coach. It had no effect on my PS2 or PS3. It just blinked the headset symbol on my game every once and a while, and when it decided to stay a while, it did nothing when I spoke into it."
2,3 Month Review *UPDATED 5/2008*,"I purchased one of these for a pretty good price. Office Depot is the place I received it from. Worked for a while, yes it is a tight squeeze on your head, and will give you a headache. After about 2-3 months my microphone stopped working, and I've been trying to get support since, with no success as of yet.Update 5/20/08 - Well just to update everyone it took me two weeks to find correct dept. at Motorola and an escalation to a supervisor there before they finally agreed to send me a replacement. The first replacement was worst - couldn' hear anyone and mic didn't work. I called them again they sent yet another one. Now this 3rd one finally worked as it should, until this time about 4-6 months after getting the good replacement again the mic is dead. No one can hear me again on any PS2 game online. Buyer beware. Even though this looks good, it must be cheaply made by Motorola and your mic may stop working after 3-6 months."
1,DONT GET IT!,"I got this product and it looked really cool and everything and I used it and it worked fine average quality, it worked for about 7 hours then I unplugged it and went to sleep, woke up and plugged it in multiple times and it wouldn't work, the ps3 couldn't detect it at all. So now it's compleyely pointless to have. Don't waste your time getting it, also the headset is very uncomforotable and gave me a headache after about an hour."
3,It's okay,"This book has some useful ideas for training, but there are only a few which I would consider truly excellent."
2,Not In Depth,"Loren's book had good principles that every novice should know. The only complaint that I have is that this book merely skimmed the topics and didn't go far enough into detail that was needed. I would recommend that you read this book only if you have no background knowledge whatsoever on training. I would not, however, recommend this book to any advanced student."
3,These lessons are about technique,"There are different styles of learning, and different interests in playing the harmonica. I got this set after all the raves I had heard, but was disappointed.This Masterclass is all about learning playing techniques...not blues, not riffs. It covers it all, up to very advanced 'overblow' techniques, but ends up leaving the less musical and beginners frustrated (that's me).If you want to learn about the blues (and the harmonica), get Gindick's Rocks and Blues Harmonica.If you want hole-by-hole blues lessons, look at David Barrett's series (my favorite).And if you are musical and can find your own way, then try Portnoy's Masterclass."
4,"Impressive ""little"" blower!","As advertised and offered by others (reviews), this little blower packs an impressive force. Idea for my wife to use, without her having to carry so much weight. Idea for convenient cleaning of lawnmowers & garage without messing around with the larger gas types. Only negative aspect is how the cord fastens. Not very well designed to stay plugged up. Otherwise good purchase! Good price and a handy tool to have for easy garage/deck/patio cleaning."
4,Good for small projects.,"Very good price, reasonable delivery time. I have used it to clean up small areas and it worked well. You just have to realize that you will have to purchase a good three prong extension cord in the length you require. That is an additional cost but I stll would recommend the product for small jobs and for anyone not wanting a gas powered blower."
2,Nice photos with little substance,"Here's an example of a book that should never have been produced. The author is obviously misinformed and quite frankly, ignorant, regarding watches. The book is riddled with incorrect information regarding watch descriptions, including blatantly wrong jewel counts, movement descriptions, and the repititious ""very fine and rare"", ""fine and lovely"", ""very fine and very rare"", ad nauseum. The author constantly includes ""micrometric regulator"" in descriptions of pocket watches, that have NO micrometric regulators! The book is attractive, and has some excellent photographs, but, at best, this is a book that needed an author with some watch ""smarts""."
2,ISP Compatibility,I didn't get an opportunity to run this product because it does not work with AOL or Juno which I discovered AFTER I installed it on my system. The advertisement should include which ISP's the product won't work with along with the needed system configuration and added ISP's info.
3,Royal Navy on Shore,"Although a good look at the Royal Navy in the latter part of the 19th Century, this book mainly is a covert operation on shore by a Royal Navy Lt. There is some back story to the character, but not much and you are left wondering how the protaganist got to where he is and faces the problems he does in the Navy. Also, this book has clear bloodlines in the early 20th century works of ""boys adventure"" stories that were written to show young males how to act in different situations, acceptably that is. The story does have some good points, but little in the way of historical relevance and information. Lots of information is missing to understand the motivations of each of the parties in the book. But, there is action involved and some of the naval information is good to know, especially the new times of steam ships in the Royal Navy. I hope the rest of the books in the series are better now that the intoductions, although short and incomplete, are out of the way."
3,It could be better,"When I bought this book I thought that It could be an excellent story, because I have read Batman year two and I think It's one of the most amazing strories I've ever read. However, This time the book has'nt got the same ""power"" and It's just a simple story with some bored topics. I think that the writer didn't Know how to extract all the power of the incredible characters."
5,Anytime Now!!!!,"This was my favorite show growing up. With all that's in our world today and family values in the toilet, I struggle to find something for my kids to watch on Saturday Morning. I want to warp them like I was warped growing up. My brother and I useD to quote this show all the time. If we need anything as a society, we need more good, clean comedy like this instead of the CRAP that's on tv today. I love how a show can be on tv for a season and then on DVD the next. Let's bring back the stuff that got us through the 80's and early 90's. Now let's all scream together... Ready: WE WANT BALKI!!! DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!!! LET'S DO THE DANCE OF JOY!!!"
5,Found it on DVD!,Hey Gang! Like yourselves I have also been looking for PS on DVD until I happened on a website which offers the full 8 seasons on28 DVD's. Its kind of on the pricy side but the site guarantees their products so I was thinking of investigating and stopping the search. Then again maybe I should wait...but I digress...if you wish to check it out for yourself:dvdcollections.tv...but u haven't heard that from me...no u haven't...
1,TOTAL LEMON DON'T BUY,"I can't even give this one star, but amazon wouldn't let me post unless I did. There is a bug ""More than one ink tank of the color is installed"" with NO fix from Canon. The software interface between the color cartridge and the printer was a hack job. I have spent hours contacting canon, returning ink cartridges to the store, and troubleshooting this. I will NEVER buy a Canon printer again."
3,Beware Problems after a year and half,"I bought this printer 12/2006 based on the above reviews. I've loved the printer up until this week. Now the paper simply won't feed properly and jams. Canon's help site says for this problem clean the roller. I've done that many times now to no avail. Their next advice is take it to a dealer. Well since there isn't a dealer for hundreds of miles from me that's a silly option for me.Due to the fact that I have new print cartridges in the printer and some to spare, I'll probably buy another used one to see me through the ink. I'm disappointed and can't bare the thought of starting to review printers again."
4,Canon PIXMA 6700D,"This printer is very quiet and Prints good pictures. Some of my best pictures were printed on matte Photo paper. I miss the automatic off and on feature that my i950 had, but I've gotten use to not having that option now. The two trays really come in handy, but you must manually switch the feeder when you want to change paper trays. The ink cartridges cost a little more than the i950, but so far, I have printed more photos than with the i950, before I needed to replace a cartridge, and so far, I have only change one, yellow."
5,Great Photo Printer,"I wanted a dedicated inkjet photo printer to print photos taken with my Canon Rebel XTI. After reading many favorable reviews, I settled on the Canon PIXMA iP6700D photo printer. WOW! Inkjet printers have come a long way in terms of print quality. This printer produces prints equal in quality to a professional photo lab. I'm very pleased with my purchase and strongly recommend this printer to everyone from serious photographer to weekend snapper. Buy it."
1,Do Not Buy a Phillips TV,"We bought a Phillips plasma TV and it had constant problems. Finally after less than two years old, it died, and we were told by Phillips that it canot be fixed because they no longer make the necessary part. Now we are stuck with a big piece of junk that cost over $2000.00 less than 2 years ago. Horrible company and products."
1,DO NOT BUY PHILLIPS OR FROM BEST BUY,"We purchased this $2000 TV set and in 17 months is was dead, took it to a repair shop twice and the parts were not available to fix it, gave the TV repair shope the TV for parts, now 5 years afte the purchase date, there is a class action law suit and we can be reimbursed for the set but we no longer have the serial # since we left the set at the repair shop and Best Buy can only go back 3 years on their records, which sucks because we through our stuff out when we gave away the TV.Avoid Phillips TV's and Best BuyThanks, Christine Christensen"
4,Good for beginners.,"Robert Vieira, Beginning SQL Server 2005 Programming (Wiley, 2006)Beginning SQL Server 2005 Programming is pretty much truth in advertising. It's a book about SQL Server 2005 Programming, and if you know much about programming SQL Server 2005, you'll find most of it to be review material. That's not to say you shouldn't read it if you're not an expert; there are always nooks and crannies that get missed when a person's learning things, and if you miss reading about them here, the next book in the series could pose some minor problems. The target market is programmers who haven't worked with databases before; if that describes you, by all means, pick this up. ***"
4,A very good introductory book,"This book is exactly what it says, a Beginner's book. Buy it if you are a real beginner but prefer something else even in case you are at the intermediate level. Now if you are a beginner with SQL Server this is a very good book. It is precise, with good examples and very explanatory. If I would have to point out potential future improvements, that would be using the AdventureWorks database for examples instead of the traditional Northwind. Also one more thing would be to explain more the new features of the SQL Server such as: Notification services, XQuery and Service Broker."
5,This book brings poetry to a new level,"THEOLOGICAL IMMORTAL ROMANCE is a spiritual uplift, a breathtaking world full of adventure and romance and so much more. It takes you where no book has gone before. This book brings poetry to a new level"
1,Crap.,"This is some of the worst purple poetry in print. It gushes, it cries, it pines; it does everything but make me want to read poetry. If you don't believe me, use the 'look inside' function and read a few of the poems. They are dreadful, the kind of stuff you would expect from a high school poetry class--no i wrote better poems in high school. This is something I would give a prisoner-of-war to read, except we have outlawed torture. If you purchased this by accident, thinking you were buying a book of poetry, I suggest you re-gift it to your dentist's office, or maybe a local Motel Six. It will fit right in with all the other kitsch."
3,Sniper by Mark Spice,"Having bought this and John Plasters book I read this one first. It's a good colourful book with plenty of photos which helps you to actaually practice various shootin positions. The book doesn't go into a huge amount of detail, but does give you a good basic explanation on how to develop a good technique. I would definitely recommend buying this plus a more advanced book to learn sniper skills. Spicer also gives details of various countries and models alot of his photo's on the Gurka snipers. There are also only a couple of pages regarding ghillie suits but does emphasise camouflage without actually giving too much detail. After that you'll need to pack up and load up and learn by experience."
3,Clears up counter space,"This is a decent product, looks good, but doesn't stick well. It stays up but doesn't hold up to me tearing off a towel. My fridge has a ""knockdown"" or ""orange peel"" like texture to it so that may be why. Its ok, and I will be keeping it, just wish the magnets held up better."
4,Very happy with this towel holder,"I haven't found any other paper towel holder that has the magnetic holding power that this one does. Bought two more for other areas in my house. Could be cuter, but functional beats cute any day."
5,Great product!,I bought this paper towel holder to stick on a metal cabinet in my hobby room. The magnets are very strong and hold the towel holder tightly in place. Great product!
5,magnetic paper towel holder,the best ever. I have owned one for more than 10 years. I didn't realized that they were still produced. Thank goodness. I just bought this one for a friend who was in desperate need of a functional paper towel holer.
4,Interesting Don Q.,"I like this performance. It is a pity that the blurring makes very hard to view the whole company.With the presentequipment this is unforgivable. As an longtime backstage worker for regional companies I am used to watch everything on stage.To nitpick a little bit, I don't like some of the extra scenes in particular the nightmare ! It does nothing for the story and I think it is boring. Also it is a waste of elaborate costumes. They were not for dancing. Also i don't like the final dance? of Don Q.Again a good Don Q but my favorite Don Q is from the Mariinsky ballet aka Kirov (out on decca)."
4,Worked the first time and everytime since,"Impressed so far becuse it is priced right, it is well made and cuts thick leather with ease. I believe that this tool may outlive me. Good job!"
5,great for small kids,This was perfect to take on a trip with us for our little guy (3 years old) rather than trying to lug a big lifejacket with. Works great and he loves the freedom it gives him to work on his swimming.
3,My opinion,"Hey, this is a great book, but a few thingz annoyed me. How come Jake is so ruthless? First he blackmails erek, not on when he had helped the animorphs a dozen of times, he goes mad at Ax, and i CANT BELIVE K A KILLED JAMES AN THE OTHERS!?! Was book #50 worth it in the end? Sorry K. A , 3 stars"
4,COMPELLING,"A compelling historical account that reads in places like a novel! This book appeals to the casual reader, the historian, and the attorney!"
4,Old but good book!,"This book has lots of information that I found very useful for the most part and very much encouraging in the hope of one day being able to have a world that once again recycles every thing it makes or grows like these old time farmers. Not sure human waste will ever become safe to harvest and return to crop land again due to all the modern medicines and toilet bowl cleaners, but it is a nice thought!"
4,Experiments in Fluid Mechanics,"When I wrote this book, I tried to obtain the favorite experiments of the best fluid dynamicists. Some of the experiments excited my students and some proved too hard. I never received an unfavorable comment on any experiment, so I believe all users enjoyed the book. I'd enjoy hearing from those who have bought and used the book."
5,Goldsmith is a God!,"This soundtrack (although too short) is too cool for words. I was so much in love with this when I first bought it that I never thot about buying the score to the sequel because I was too busy listening to this over and over.The main theme is empathic and patriotic and makes us feel what Rambo is feeling, which is sadness and despair. The action tracks are red hot. ""The Razor"" is amazing and builds up to a powerful and pressurized explosion of fury as Rambo lays waste to the cops. Other notable tracks are ""Over the Cliff"" and ""Hanging On"". This is a CD filled (but not full enough) of action and adventure that will surely excite you. This is very much deserving of 5 stars."
5,One Of My Personal Sedimental Favorites,"I bought this soundtrack on cassette from a second hand records store quite a few years ago now, the music makes me feel i am watching the movie when i am listening to it. I have the Australian version on cassette, but the listing is different, ""It's A Long Road"" is the opening song, while some of the other instrumental tracks are not in order, but that's not taking anything away from the sheer power & sweeping, beautiful sounds of Jerry Goldsmith's unforgettable score."
2,OK but dont stay in my ears,"These get the job done but I cant use them because they simply will not stay in my ears, although I have this issue with a lot of earbuds, so YMMV.The only earbuds that stay in my ears are the iPod default earbuds."
5,Excellent text and illustrations,"This is a perfect book for teaching a preschooler about time. When you think about it, that's a pretty huge concept to have to explain--but this book does it, clearly, and with delightful illustrations."
4,Not for newcomers to UML,"If you're looking for a book where you can learn UML, it will be better if you look elsewhere. As the title implies, it will give you advice on how to model a database following the principles of UML. Besides, I think this is a book dedicated to systems architects, who get a rough time trying to conciliate the disparate worlds of object oriented vs entity-relation designs.The concepts covered in this book, apply not only to Oracle databases, but you may transform them in useful practices in other databases. The bottom line: I found this book very good, but I had already experience in ER and UML modeling."
2,too early,Bought as a gift for a beginner-has not received much attention with all the snow on the ground.
2,Urban Guerilla,"I am a military historian, I judge this book under the prism and parameter of military history. As such it was very dissapointing. I expected it to be about the tactical and operational aspects of guerilla and asymetrical warfare in an urban terrain with specific case studies. What I got was a socio-political treatise of black movements and protests in the inner cities of the United States. If that was what you are looking for then it would be very informative and useful for you. But if like me you are looking to learn about guerilla warfare in an urban terrain then avoid this book. It is not a bad book. It 's just not what I wanted."
5,Wonderful and Moving Book,"I always thought that there could always be a great link between a child and a grandparent - different from that of a parent -child. This book demonstrates how such a bond can occur. Mr. Hull creates vivid characters who each have their own inner demons with which they need to come to terms. The coming together of these characters was moving, vivid, alive and funny. I was thoroughly engrossed in the tale and the lives of these characters. It's nice to find an author who can bring out the best in their characters and make us laugh and cry within pages of one another."
1,I have not received this item!,Where is my order? I have tried to navigate the help menu to no avail!s
5,"This is the sexiest music I've heard in a long, long time","Do I really need to say much more than that? Only that I want more from this group and tracking them down is difficult. Sexy, Sexy music. Fabulous musicians. Pick it up. You'll love it. Well, you'll love it if you have one sexy bone in your body!!"
4,The French and Indian War on the Ohio,"I found this book to be well-written and interesting. The author keeps the main focus to the history of the fort - Fort Duquesne, later renamed Fort Pitt, amongst other names - and its impact upon American history, as per his writing assignment, and does not stray unless to clarify or amplify important aspects of his text.For the publishing date of 1965 it is probably a very important work, although later and more inclusive works have appeared since, especially Allan Eckert's wonderful 'Winning of America' series which detail these conflicts and developments in some six volumes - actually seven, but the series officially includes only the six.Unlike Eckert or other authors, O'Meara provides a modern update on the site of the forts as well as its various periods of decay and rebuilding. It is interesting that the forts site itself is now a beautiful park in Pittsburgh, serving to remind the populace of the momentous events that once transpired there."
2,yum yum is not porno,"I am Michelle Daw,the star of this little film..We shot this in two weeks on a shoestring budget...that shows...they keep spelling my name wrong..."
3,A generic review,"Two naive women travel to New York to become fashion models, but the jobs they end up with don't exactly require clothing."
2,Awful,"These are terrible. They are very cheaply made and I suppose if you want them just to help immobilize the knee after an injury, they would be fine. I'm a jogger and have arthritic knees and just wanted something to help support my knees while working on my treadmill since I'm having a lot of trouble with them lately. They are way to stiff to even walk in and bunch up with just a few steps. I would not recommend these at all."
2,It depends what you are looking for in a workout tape,"I was not crazy about this video. She seems more into dancing around on a step instead of providing an intense workout. It may be good for a coordinated person who is trying step for the first time. She spends a lot of time piecing routines together. I don't want to be taught everyday when I watch the tape. I was looking for something that will keep my heart rate up for 30 minutes or longer and this one doesn't provide that. If you like random intensity instead of constant, you may like it."
4,Used for paper punching,"Works great for punching craft papers. Mine had a slight nick in the beveled edge which caused some initial frustration, but I was able to grind it out sufficiently. A 7/8"" punch I ordered was not as sharp, and was rather annoying to use. Both of these were ""made in India."""
3,"Cheesy and horribly written, but great examles of what WORKS","I've been in network marketing for one year and made it to the coveted VP level of my company in my first 8 months. I snap-up books on network marketing constantly. A lot of the details in this book were cheesy and painful to read, and the author is a bit full of himself. However, the story-telling does illustrate some important truths in terms of tactics for success. I went back and cut through all of the brush strokes for the tactical points I will pass along and implement. People learn through story-telling and emotion, I wish this offered additional credibility for people to relate more to the author."
4,Why Did I Pick Up This Book?,"I have no idea why I bought this book. I'm not in network marketing and I don't plan to be. Something inside me just said - get the book - so I did. I couldn't be more glad I listened to my inner monologue. This book is relevant to anyone working in any industry where they deal with people. Yes, that's most of us. I loved the simple take homes especially those about children's sport. Amazing, insightful and a breeze to read and absorb.Kirsty Dunphey, author:Retired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
4,it is what it is,"it is what it is, centrum for adults. it came quick and safely, was sealed (of course not opened) it just had few scratches and dings but its fine, as long as it didn't have a broken seal."
3,Not a bad Movie,This was not a bad movie.Mikey Rourke was very cool and professional while Tupac was the ultimate evil. I never liked Tupac and I still dont (live by the sword-Die by the sword). The movie was a little weird but just for Rourke made it worth wacthing it. A great actor
5,Love It!,Kind of expensive here in USA but you simply won't find anything that compares for richness and subtle yet long lasting aromatic sent. It feels like it's made the way they use to make soaps eons ago. My wife loves it and that's VERY important...
5,Great!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! Stays on well and fits close enough to wear under a shirt or jacket and still be concealed.
1,Regional Problems,"I guess its just my DVD player, but it cant play the DVD because it says something about regional restrictions. I tried using my PS2 but it said the same thing... And the CD isnt really useable unless you install the program that plays the CD, you cant even play the songs without the CD... So if you wanted to make a personal CD, you wouldnt be able to... So basically, I wouldnt recommend this...."
1,Made of wet paper towel!!!,This glove fell apart with light use over 6 months. The leather palm became torn and the padding was moderate. Definately not worth $40.00!!!
4,Plain talk on flying planes.,Airborne Express is most definitely a company that has a lot of aircraft. During the course of the day as I work there a lot of terms get thrown about on the subject of aircraft and flying. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Flying and Gliding has helped me to bring those terms from the heavens and made them a little more down to earth. The Guide takes you from the history of flight to how the aircraft flies and on into the cockpit itself. A book that should be on the self of even the most experienced flyer. Ohio the birthplace of aviation.
5,This Game is REALLY FUN!,"What can be better than building your very own RPG. This game has it all-scenarios,character graphics, an anime maker(real cool),tons of musical scores, and even a built in RPG called Gobi's something...I played the import version at my friends house and if the U.S. version is half as good, I'm gonna buy it."
4,the greatest game.,"this is a must for role playing fan,you create your own dunguen,monster,and charters it is worth buying"
3,A differebt Robin,A different Robin from what one was use to seeing. Robin seems to be almost manic with racial over tones.
1,Don't buy it!,Bought this game last week spent 4 hours trying to download it! it requires a basilion patches and other downloads and still requires more! Through it in the trash!Don't buy it!
2,Buggy,"Couldn't get this game to run on my computer. Tried to reinstall a couple of times, contacted customer support, no help. Eventually uninstalled it, but it left some kind of residual program on my machine, so I ultimately had to reinstall Windows to get rid of it.Played the first one, and it was great, so I bet this one is fun too, but I wouldn't know."
1,Doesn't suck,"This vacuum has no suction. It gets clogged instantaneously. While I don't find it heavy or cumbersome, mobility doesn't matter when it won't pick up dirt. It spits out dirt and dog hair from the back and is completely useless on bare floors. If you can manage to get it to suck up dirt, the canister has to be emptied before you even finish a room (and I have very small rooms). Huge waste of money."
5,Eureka Boss 4D Upright Vacuum - 5892BVZ,"Great Product..This is our third unit in Five years.. Two are still working fine as we have eight children, many pets & much cleaning & vacuuming to perform on a daily basis. This unit's suction is unsurpassed with virtually any other machined ever owned or tried, including Dyson's new units. We use it in all (3) levels of our home.Would highly recommend especially for the cost in low hundreds, where others that boast similar power would be much higher....Eureka did their homework in this unit's design........Jim BPS--> Amazon is a failsafe way to shop also as they back all vendors that sell through their site. It is a comfortable way to shop...jjb"
5,Awesome!,Wow! Hours of fun for the whole family. We spent all of Christmas day plaing the Easy level and still found it to be difficult to answer some of the questions. A Must buy for the whole family.
3,This is a number set,"From the part number of 22981, this is a number set, NOT a letter set. Be sure what you are going to get before ordering!!!Ken H>"
3,Not part of the Manga series...,"I thought this was part of the Hellsing Manga series. It is not. This is a Manga style ""novelization"" of the very popular Anime tv series. Literally. They took still images directly from the anime and formed a graphic novel out of them. There is nothing new and the story differs from the Manga (as the Anime did). Unlike the usual Manga, all the pages are full color and glossy. Unfortunately, it appears to be an attempt to cash in on the popularity of Hellsing in the US without giving the fans anything new. I only recommend this for Hellsing collectors/completists."
5,good family fun,"I bought this game primarily with my 5-year-old in mine. She can play with some assistance, and she enjoys it a lot. The rest of the family, an 8 year old and a 10 year old, and my wife and I, enjoy it very much as well. It is fun and mind-expanding at the same time."
2,"Undoubtedly a GREAT book, but a TERRIBLE Kindle edition","DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION OF FAITH'S CHECKBOOK!!! It is so full of typos. This edition sadly misrepresents the author and someone should do something to get this Kindle edition off the market. For example, in today's reading in the book (March 16) there are three typos/wrong words in the opening paragraph. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!"
4,Good Spiritual Encouragements,"This book has daily encouraging, uplifting devotions for the Christian walk. It's got lots of practical information and has this ""magical"" quality that somedays when you pick it up...you're reading something that seems only meant for you! And that's when you know how Awesome God is...to be able to orchestra that!! :) Great book!!"
5,The Definitive Classical Trumpet CD,"While I mean no disrespect to Mr. Meuller, his 1 star rating for the sublime performance by Marsalis and company here is quite frankly an insult to such a fine effort. Wynton Marsalis is without a doubt the best trumpet player on the face of this planet, and that is not going to change any time soon. Quite frankly, this debut classical recording by Marsalis is also his best (and Grammy Award winning to boot). I don't begrudge Mr. Meuller for thinking another player or performance better, but to say that *many* trumpet *students* play these works better is an outrageous statement, and I hope other prospective buyers do not take such unfair and inacurate remarks to heart.For my part, this CD has been in my collection for years (actually, I have had to replace it several times due to wearing the CDs out), and it will remain so. You have a classic CD at an unbelievable price here. Don't pass this one up for your collection."
5,Elvis - His Life & Music - Must Have !,"I just received this limited edition serial numbered deluxe box set from 1994 from my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. This ultimate Elvis Presley Collector's Edition includes four digitally-mastered CD's with 48 golden hits from the 50s and 60s, These 4 CD's were made from RCA masters exclusively for this deluxe box. Also included is a beautiful 176 Page over-sized 11 1/4'' X 11 1/4'' hardcover biography with over 200 color and black and white photos and text that follows Elvis' life from Tupelo to Graceland. There is also a comprehensive 16-page session journal on these legendary recordings including authoritative text on each of the songs, as well as rare photographs of Elvis in the studio during the original Hound Dog recording sessions. Also included in this book is a comprehensive filmography. It is all packaged in a very special leather-like black slipcase. It is a must have for Elvis Collectors."
1,Plastic edge chipped away,"Received this for Christmas and REALLY needed the scraper. First time I used it was fine. Next time, I noticed the ice I scraped the day before had chipped away the plastic edge. Now I just get streaks. Not happy..."
4,as always excellent stories,"J A Jance as always produces excellent stories and this is no different than the rest, I always look forward to a new book from this author."
3,Not the best Jance book,"J.A. Jance is a prolific and reliable author, but this book is not up to her usual standards. The murders in this book are brutal and both follow the same m.o. A person is burned to death and each finger and toe are severed. J.P. Beaumont and his new partner, Sue Danielson, do enough investigating to make a connection with a Nazi past and some missing gold from a German death camp. Perhaps in an effort to infuse something more exotic into this series, Ms. Jance sacrifices some of the basics of good writing. There are indeed, many unanswered questions at the end. I began to wonder if I had drifted off somewhere in the reading process! We do catch the usual glimpses of the attractive environs of Seattle and J.P. Beaumont is more human and more attractive as a recovering alcoholic rather than a man who reaches for a McNaughton's every time the going gets tough."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book has very inappropriate suggestions. It is very judgemental. For instance it lists things that are common at weddings like Cakes that have fountains in them as ""Tacky"". There are many things in this book I didn't agree with and many things this book suggested should never be in a weding, I have often seen at wonderful weddings. I took this book right back to the store I bought it from."
5,Continued Excellence,"An informative book giving the reader a vast amount of information about the members of the state police, including those who lost their lives in the line of duty and those who received the highest awards for bravery and much more. A must read book.Alexander Pineiro NYSP Sgt/SC Ret."
3,great while it lasted,"I loved this umbrella. I used it for a year, and then the little catch stopped working, so it wouldn't stay open. I bought another one, but the umbrella shaft was splintered so it wouldn't open at all. It's nice and lightweight, and the curved handle is very nice. But it's just not very sturdy."
1,Dancing With Disaster,"Anyone foolish enough to follow this fool's advice deserves whatever happens to them. Just another moving average technical analysis scheme. As such, it is guaranteed to fail."
5,A Proven Market Theory,Excellent! Yanis' Y-Process is a sound theory that he substantiates by backtesting on 70 years of S&P 500 performance data. Developed and written by an engineer for the average investor who is concerned with the optimumzation of returns in a preservation of capital portfolio.
3,Will not work on Windows 8,This game will not work right off the bat with new computers. Check for compatibility before the purchase. I am still working on it but enjoy the product so much I am willing to wait.
1,Useless to the advanced user,"This book is just to short and just does not explain anything in any amount of detail at all!!!! For the amount of money I really would just order somethingelse. I.E. 1 section of the book says find that perfect lighting solution try setup a line and space lights around it, now if you are advanced then you would usally go straight only radiosity or light tracer. This book to me was a real dissapointment and Im waiting for someone to buy it second hand from me. A real book to collect dust in your bookcase"
1,Defeats the message,"This book offers nothing.There are reasoned/principled arguments for many of the positions that Savage takes. Unfortunately, his hyperbolic diatribe undercuts the ability of thinking conservatives to advance the argument. We all become identified with his rhetoric. He does us no good."
1,An Ann Coulter Wannabe,"It's not too late for Michael Savage to completely embrace the Nazi party. He spends so much time comparing liberals to Nazis that he must harbour some secret desire to be one (a Nazi that is) himself.People like Dr. Weiner (or is it ""Whiner""), his real name, have figured out the latest conservative way to make money - write a poorly thought out, uneducated, unintelligent rant about how liberals are ""evil.""The sad thing is that people actually buy this non-sensical garbage.What is this man's qualifications to even debate (if you can call what he does debating) these issues? He studied plants in college.I think he is a plant."
2,"Good message but poorly written, unconvincing","This is the type of book that inspires Al Franken and Michael Moore. There are some good arguments to be made against the secularization of America and other conservative authors have made them decently, some better than others, but this book shows an amateur. Read something by Bill O'Reilly and you get the sense that his argument is mildly reasonable, even if you hold different views. The man it seems is trying to convince you that his argument is valid. Read the pages of this book and you are embarrassed to be a conservative. Savage's goal isn't to convince his detractors or even the undecided person, that he, Savage is right, but merely to please everyone who already agrees with him. Then again, anyone who is as ashamed of his religion as savage is hard to take seriously anyway."
1,if liberals are SO stupid...,"its funny, Savage always says liberals just dont get, but he wont dare debate Chomsky on his show.i guess Savage is doing us mentally ill folk a favor, dont want to hurt our poor little feelings."
4,"Freedom, faith & family.","Those are the three cornerstones which have made our country great. But those three cornerstones have been constantly under attack for the last 40-plus years by those who seek to undermine our country and tear it down. They attack our society through the courts, the media and even through our schools and college campuses. This is the Savage Truth--a wakeup call to stand up and take back America from these 60's radicals who are still trying to create their own little world--their own warped alternate reality--where they would no longer have to accept responsibility or fear consequences for their actions (...if it feels good, do it.). You're right, Michael--only as a ""Savage Nation"" does America have a chance to survive the onslaught of the RDDB's (many of whom have probably given your books one-star ratings without having read them) and the perverse, socialistic ideas they embody."
5,never got it and cant find out how to go about getting it to come in the mail.,"I ordered this and another book on Jan. 5, I still havent got them and its Feb. 15. WTF. It says that I already have them but how do I tell them I don't?"
3,over extreme,I have perused through most of this book and would say most of the comments of the author are overly extreme. For one thing he does not say how this country can be taken back from the liberals. What is forgotten in this book is that the voter is the employer and when enough people start voting responsibly we can start getting these irresponsible politicians kicked out of office.
1,Incredibly Laughable Reading,"There is no way this man can be serious. This book is a joke, it has to be. It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane. I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic. If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within."
1,intolerance and hate abounds,"A conservative Asian American myself, I cannot see why the FCC hasn't gone after this man. He likes to say he coined the phrase ""compassionate conservatism,"" yet all I hear from his mouth are slangs, slurs, and one 4-letter word that pops up a lot on his program: hate.Compassionate conservative my @$$."
4,Almost right on,"Learned a bit. Savage seems a little too full of himself about his departure from MSNBC. He also seems to blame Fox news for this. I apprieciate his religious convictions, but he could tone that part down a bit. Other than those two minor exceptions, the book was one I would recomend to anyone who is trying to gain information about politics in this country."
4,Really good but I still like Red better,First of all I'm only giving this four stars because Red blew my mind. I did like the story and the romance aspect was very interesting I very much enjoyed that the only thing it lacked was the intense action of Red. There was plenty of action don't get me wrong I liked the book very much but so far Red is still my favorite. I still definately reccomend the entire series to anyone who hasnt read them and reccomend you continue to white if you have already read Red.
5,White By Ted Dekker,This is an excellent third book in this trilogy series. I have enjoyed all of Ted's books but this series has been my favorite so far.
1,Out there without a net,"My main problem with this book is that although there is some interesting information and pictures in it, the author seems to be pretty much of a nut case. He is convinced that he is some kind of superior being who has achieved the depths of all knowledge, but I have not found any of his material to be all that useful, and in places (often significant places), it is just downright weird and confusing. It is often hard to escape the impression that he is being deliberately vague or confusing simply to sound more knowing or profound.Anyone who is interested in an introduction to the Tarot and the Qabalah would be much better served by a book such as ""Qabalistic Tarot"" by Robert Wang, or even ""The Mystical Qabala"" by Dion Fortune (although the latter is much more focused on the Qabala than the Tarot)."
4,An enjoyable gay romance!,"A Bit of Rough wasn't as rough as I thought it'd be, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It was light on the bdsm- more about dominance and trust than bondage. At first, the pairing of architect James Justin and rough cowboy Abraham ""Bram"" Lord seems unlikely, but as the story progresses, one can easily see how their differences compliment each other. Bram is the kind of man who knows what he wants and goes for him and is very confident in his sexuality. James on the other hand, isn't quite sure what he wants or needs. He's more career-minded than worried about his own needs and is not sure what to think of Bram and his dominant ways. It's interesting to watch James go through the emotions and doubts as he learns more about himself through Bram. This is a nice love story that beats the odds. I'm looking forward to reading more about Bram and James in their sequel, Roughhousing."
4,Wonderful Characters,"Just re-read this book now that I've read the sequel,Roughhousing. I love Bram and James and would love to read more about them outside of sex. Don't get much of that in this book though--it is almost all sex.As with so many erotic romances, they were professing deep love within 24 hours of meeting. Still, the author does well with the characters and in depicting that love, if you can put the time frame out of your mind."
5,Wonderful surprise!,"I came across this author accidentally after purchasing her other book, ""Out There in the Night"" (which I highly recommend) not realizing it was m/m erotica. I enjoyed it so much, I ordered this right away, and was not disappointed.It was supposed to be a steamy one night stand. James and Bram come together in an explosive sex scene in the alley behind a club. But it turns into so much more when they decide to hook up together for dinner. Excellent romance story."
2,Not very great,"I actually borrowed this book and some of the advice for curly haired people is disastrous. Such as washing the scalp and conditioning the hair - not very good at all - it leaves your scalp and hair sooooo itchy and dry. the book had no new information, and overall it didn't necessarily tell YOU how to take care of your hair, it was more how a rooky hair dresser should take care of YOUR hair."
1,Others are better,"I read this book after reading curly hair books by Ouidad and Massey, both of which I thought were way better, esp. Massey's ""Curly Girl."" Like another reviewer noted, this book seems to be mostly for black women, with many chapters devoted to straightening, texturizing, weaves, etc. I only picked up a couple good new tips that I personally could use: don't over-rinse out your conditioner, and apply your leave-in with hair extremely wet. But even one good tip makes me feel the book was worthwhile. Meanwhile, I happened to get my pack of Hair Rules wavy hair products the same day I got the book, and I used them this morning. So far, they seem really great. After I give them a longer trial, I'll be back to report. I've tried zillions of products, and had increasingly good results with Ouidad, Devachan, Curlisto, Bumble & bumble Curl Conscious. Hair Rules may prove to be the best yet."
3,Great explanation on Kinky/Curly Hair,"very good information, some of it we all already know. overall, it was a good read/purchase."
5,Last STand At Saber River,We really enjoy Tom Selleck's movies. This is a good western. Great movie to share with friends and family especially on a cold snowy day.
1,Should be Called My First Escape,"If you want to spend the day hunting for your hamster, please put him/her or in this cage and walk off for an hour or so.Silly me, I thought if I bought a cage designed FOR a hamster, it would keep her in. (NOT a dwarf hamster, by the way). My mistake.Not sure what the solution is yet, but I guess we'll have to find it."
4,good deal,I love this cage! I have two young guinea pigs and it is perfect for them. It also comes with all the supplies needed to get you started with your pigs. It is a really good price! I have two dogs that are fascinated by my guinea gigs. I needed a cage with a lid to keep the piggies safe. The only drawbacks are the size and door latch.The cage isn't quite big enough for two adult pigs. It is a good size for one adult but two adults need a little more space. The door latch is hard to open and close. For this reason I wouldn't recomend this cage for young children.
3,NO NO NO,I bought this for my 2 ferrets and its pretty good but its way to small. I wasn't able to fit my second hammock and when my ferrets had kittens i had to get a bigger ferret home and it worked way better and there was so much more space.
4,About 1'' bar space.,"This is a nice cage, I am going to use it for rats and couldn't find a bar size and went by the photo. If you have only large rats it will probably work, babies get a net...lol..."
3,water bottle didnt work,"The cage itself is good and a decent size, although the water bottle that was ""100% guaranteed not to leak at all"".... did nothing but run water out of it. I couldn't even use it at all. I had to immediately go out and purchase a water bottle in the midst of setting up my rabbits new house. That wasn't fun, or expected."
4,A Review Misquoted.,"Reviewer: StepheI like this, it's worth listening to.(this is about the best I could do)"
5,The Price is Not Great Than God God's Grace,Great book by Oretha Hagin! The book was given out at the Marriage Enrichment breakout session at our annual church Women's Retreat. Those who received the book were excited about the wisdom and insight of Mrs. Hagin.
4,Enter David Innes,"Having already created two highly memorable science fiction heroes in Tarzan and John Carter, Edgar Rice Burroughs begins his third major series with David Innes. With friend Abner Perry, they dive their ""mole"", or burroughing machine, straight through the earth's surface where they discover the savage land of Pellucidar. Here, where dinosaurs still exist and mankind is enslaved by the reptilian Mahars, David and his friend are forced to face unknown perils and survive in a hostile environment.""At the Earth's Core"" is another highly entertaining science fiction novel from ERB. Even though his format is formulaic, you're always assured of fast paced adventure in his novels. Not as groundbreaking as Tarzan or as strong as John Carter, The Pellucidar series is still a worthy addition to Burroughs body of work, and it gets an extra star for the nostalgia of being a personal childhood favorite."
1,Maggie Smith gets Real,"Maggie Smith is her own woman. Her passion and fears for her career as an actress come through during her time with Charlie Rose. She is and has been at the zenith of her acting career and yet, for the wanna-be in the audience, she brings the realities of the ""specie"" to the head of the class. No rose colored glasses here in the ""getting there""...I've watched her on stage for 30 years and followed every movie she has made. Every performance from the ingenue with Dame Margaret Rutherford to Harry Potter's wonderful teracher, Maggie makes the theatre possible if one accepts what she accepted years ago: she was born to do this, but that didn't make it easy throughout the process."
2,Snowcross Championship,"While this game is fun at first for Yamaha owners, I don't think that the gameplay is good enough to keep anybody occupied for long. The game is also very small in size, it only took me 45 minutes to unlock all the sleds. But what can you really expect for ten dollars?"
5,Exceptional relaxation tool! (And FUN!),"There's hours of amazing creative play and relaxation here! Relax your mind, stretch your imagination or use it as a meditation tool. Ruth Heller's Designs for Coloring: More Geometrics is a blast!Buy it, you'll adore it!"
1,Arrogance and Confusion,"A striking example of displaying one's personal possessions, this book seems more of an ode to the authors' material obsessions than either well designed art book or useful cookbook. The contents are at once arrogant (why do we care about the author's fancy race cars?) and the method inconsistent (do the food selections reflect the artists' preferences? or what the authors' would like to serve them as dinner guests?). The layout and typography is confused and without hierarchy which makes the contents difficult and frustrating to navigate. The ""research"" seems to be a few quotes culled from cocktail parties and art books - sources generally not considered either reliable or scholarly. The book has nice paper."
2,Did I read the same book as the other reviewers?,"For a time, I lived in Wisconsin & now live in a heavily woodedarea like the scenes in this book. I am an avid reader of the Truecrime genre. Yes, John Ray was a ""nut case"" and his family& shrinks should have acted on his problems years before. But Ihad a hard time slogging through this book as every mundane detail ofpolice procedure is detailingly catalogued - even though it is notrelevant to the story. (I could understand it if there was an errorin procedure that caused ramifications in the criminal trial - buthere it is boringly gratuitous.) The book is the opposite of an""I couldn't put it down"" good read - but the policeproceedural texts are good for curing insomnia."
4,A really good read...........,"I am an avid reader of true crime and I must say this is one of the best. It is well written and the author leaves no stone unturned to let the reader know exactly what John Weber was all about. I just don't understand how his family didn't do more for him? If my brother stole my underwear and wrote perverted letters to me, I would have ran out of my house so fast I would have left a skid marks. I wouldn't have stayed around to hear him talk to himself, that's for sure. And I don't get his wife. Besides the fact that he looked like a baby with a beard, his bedwetting would have been enough for me to hit the road. I can't believe that this weird little deviant wasn't throwing off ""I'm a nut"" signals to anyone. The description of the way he killed Carla will leave the reader sickened. Not for the fainthearted that's for sure."
3,Doesn't stay well in my ear,"This is probably personal preference, but I don't find this stays well in my ear. It does come with different-size earpieces, but even with the most comfortable fit, I find the cord pulls this down off my head.The rubber ring also tends to fall off the earpiece, though I haven't lost one yet.I've never had a complaint about noise with this headset, though it is used almost exlusively in a home where there is no wind."
3,retract my previous review,"I want to retract my previous review and state that as I adjust to the Slovenian Language I have been very successful using this book. As a newcomer to this language, it was difficult to get used to their use of grammar, spellings, etc. And, you also have to get used to the layout of this book. I would recommend it, but be patient getting used to using it."
1,What a mish-mosh,This book is a New Age muddle of incorrect assumptions about buddhism and various aboriginal belief systems. This author doesn't get ANY of it quite right. She takes bits and pieces from different religious or philisophical traditions and sticks them together with bits of cellophane tape. I've seen collages made by kindergardeners that made more philisophical sense.NOT recommended.
1,Dreadful,"I am going to be moderating a panel on leadership for my local Chamber of Commerce and the staff person said she was going to be using this book. I ordered it and tried to read it but found it to be poorly written and a bit more ""fringe"" than I was comfortable with. I couldn't get through it. If your thing is indigenous peoples it might be up your alley, but I've read dozens of better books on leadership."
1,It SUCKED,"I was so disappointed in this dvd. When I ordered it, I expected some great bloopers, instead, it was some amateur compilation of crap. I bought it as a gift for someone andwas actually embarrassed when we began watching it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
5,A comic genius!,"A master ventriloquist, great keyboard player, superb comic sense and timing...Taylor Mason is the full package. And he does it with all audiences in mind...there's no need to send the kids out of the room. His act is clean, clever (especially when he's describing how he responds when he's mistaken for a store clerk), timely and entertaining throughout. Taylor is also versatile enough to carry a tune effectively, whether in a trio with his puppet friends, or when he's tenderly touching our hearts during a tribute to his wife and children. If you've seen Taylor Mason with the Gaither Homecoming tour and loved his act, you'll surely want to add ""Here We Go"" to your collection."
4,Worth Havin',"Unbelievable. I had been trying to figure out the artist who did the song, ""Anything worth havin' is worth waiting for"", For at least thirty years. KBLX played the song and I didnt hear them say who the artist was. I have been in love with and longing to hear that song ever since. Finally, when I put the lyrics up online Johnny Kemps name came up...I was totally surprised. I would have never associated that song with Johnny and I never paid that much attention to him when he came out. I purchased the album right away and played the song as soon as I got it. That song alone makes purchasing the album totally worth it."
5,Reality Check,This book is simply amazing--and I love that the emphasis is simply on the beauty of the moth. I would recommend it as a gift for anyone who will appreciate being reminded of the miraculous beauty of that which we bypass(or worse...swat at) every day. A fantastically wonderful reality check.
2,"Low Quality Lime Silicate glass, not the old pyrex","Pyrex is no longer made by Corning, and it is no longer made of durable borosilicate glass. The name brand was sold off. Pyrex is made in asia of much cheaper lime silicate glass. I was researching bakeware recently because I wanted the best, and what you want is borosilicate. One brand I found is Marinex, it is made of what Pyrex USED to be made of-- borosilicate glass. This is the highest quality glass you can get for bakeware. Pyrex may not stand up to freezer to oven use. I have also read many accounts of pyrex developing micro cracks you can't see. These then fill with liquid in the oven, and POW, they shatter, injuring people at worst or ruining dinner at best. Buyer beware."
1,NOT the Pyrex your mother had!,"Having used pyrex for over 20 years I had to replace a 9x13"" baking pan that was dropped (it probably would have lasted another 20 had it not been). Without reservation I went out and got another pyrex branded dish only to have it crack in less than a month of solid use. Nobody was hurt, thankfully but the new pyrex is no longer the same high quality product that used to be made by corning, in fact when I looked at the bottom of all my glass baking dishes they were all stamped ""corning NY"" on there. Sad to see a great product line come to an end, supposedly however in Europe the same high quality borosilicate glass is still used in the Pyrex name, I guess it's just too good for us Americans to have."
4,Well cushioned and comfortable,"This sock is thick and provides excellent cushioning during a run; however, my feet get hot in them during summer running."
5,Super Comfy!,"These socks really help when I amout for a long run. They have decreased the amount of blisters I have gotten, and really help keep my feet cool and dry."
3,"Strong plot, steeped in ambiguity","Grimes maintains a high level of ambiguity about the central characters, thereby presenting us with a thoughtful musing on the vagaries of memory and personal identity. The delicate balance is resolved, not in a dramatic climax and denouement, but in a subtle lifting of the veil. Some might even argue that the veil is never fully lifted. In any case, it is very well done.On the negative side, I am tired of Grimes's cute characters, and I was tempted to skip past any scenes involving aunt Agatha."
3,Corpse in a Desk,"Martha Grimes serves up a confusing addition to the Jury/Plant series with THE FIVE BELLS AND BLADEBONE. Antique dealer, Marshall Trueblook, after much haggling with Lady Summerston of Watermeadows has acquired a handsome desk. When the desk is delivered to his shop it contains the body of Simon Lean, the husband of Lady Summerston's granddaughter. Lean was never faithful to his wife, only her money and he intended to have it all, but accidents do foul the best laid plans.The story moves from Longpidden to London as Jury and Plant follow a masterful laid trail of murder and revenge.You may never learn who is who unless you read between the lines.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
3,"Interesting, but not what I expected","The book is more specifically aimed at a particular island in Greece. It is interesting, and I like some of the recipes, and the stories, but I was looking for some more general, and widely prepared dishes from Greece."
3,"Hard to find item, okay, but could be better","I needed this specific type of brass adaptor and the Anderson Metals fitting seemed a great choice, especially since there are not that many places that this fitting is available. It is a solidly made fitting. My only complaint is that on the one I received, both the male and felmale threads were either pretty roughed up, or were cut with a faily worn out cutter - the male threads were especially disappointing. However, the fitting is usable. Maybe I just got a not so good one. So basically what I am saying is that the strength and design are excellent, but fit and finish are not as good as one would hope.Anderson Metals Brass Pipe Fitting, Adapter, NPT Male x NPT Female"
1,JUNK,"This is completely unusable. The pedals are jerky -- really really jerky -- that you can actually injure yourself with it. The base is not solid and so on top of the jerky pedalling, you gotta deal with the base moving all over the place. I returned it as soon as I tried it."
5,helps ease knee pain,I use this watching TV and it helps keep my arthritic knees limber as well as working my upper and lower legs.
5,Great for the price!,"I bought this to go under my desk and help with circulation. The exerciser is quiet and smooth and basically exactly what I was expecting. My only complaint is I am 5'8"" tall so I had to lower my chair to stop my knees from hitting the desk!"
4,Good Product. Great Price.,"This works really nice. The intensity is good enough for me, but i could see some people thinking it does not offer enough resistance. I use it while Im watching tv just so im moving more. Im not looking for a super crazy cardio workout...so its ideal for me.The floor pads that come on it work great. No sliding around on the floor. I love that the body, for the most part, is one solid piece. Very sturdy feeling, and not cheap or flimsy feeling at all..when i bought it, at this price, i thought it would feel like a lesser quality.I did notice that the the metal bar that the pedals are on, gets very hot. I burned myself grabbing it by the middle of the bar to move it, after using it. Just an fyi.Anyways, i think its worth the price."
1,Useless product,"I purchased this product in an attempt to continue my physical therapy rehab while traveling cross country. Being only 5 weeks out of knee surgery I could not afford an interuption in my daily physical therapy routine which is centered heavily around stationary biking. I was going to be traveling for two weeks in an RV cross country and thought this would be a suitable substitute while traveling. After pedaling on this contraption for the better part of the distance between Austin and Memphis, I was quite disappointed to find that this machine was utterly useless. The pedal rotation was to small to offer any range of motion benefit and it's impossible to tighten the resistance to obtain any meaningful strength benefit. I didn't expect the same workout as I get at home but I hoped to at least have some benefit. This product isn't even worth the small amount of $$ it costs. Don't waste your money!"
5,Isokinetics Pedal Exerciser,"This is a nice, simple piece of equipment for the office if you are sitting all day. If you place it under your desk you will need to lower your chair. It is a good way to burn some calories by staying in motion. I noticed a difference in just a week by pedaling two hours per day while working at computer. Keep some household oil on hand for when it starts to squeak."
4,Work it!,Happy this came assembled! Well worth the extra $2 from other non-assembled products. Good resistance!
3,ok for someone with small feet,"I was hoping this would be a good gift for my 92-year old dad, but alas his feet are too big to go round on the pedaler. He wears size 9.5"
3,Decent,"I got this hoping to use it at my desk while I work. Unfortunately, my knees hit the underside of the desk when I pedal, so I can't do that. Instead I use it while watching TV. I don't think it will ever be all that aerobic of a workout, but it's good for what it is, getting me to move a little when I'd otherwise be sitting on the couch doing nothing."
4,Odd Smell - Cigarettes?,"I got the item today and tried it out and it seems to be fine. But when I opened the box and the plastic, it has a very foul odor like cigarettes or an ashtray. I'm not sure if it is just the smell of the shipping materials or if the person doing the shipping is a chain smoker. Regardless, the smell is gross and seems to linger. Otherwise, I pedaled for about 5-10 minutes leaning back on the couch which made it seem like a recumbent bike. I think it will suit my needs and it is much smaller and cheaper than actually buying an exercise bike."
3,"Made well, a little on the tall side.","This pedal excerciser is made very well. I purchased it for work but due to the height of it, my knees hit under my desk."
4,pedal exercisor,this item works fine and is great for flexing my knees while watching tv. It was worth the money spent.
2,Tension! What tension?,The tension lever doesn't seem to do anything at all and while pedaling there is some slipping so it ois not a smooth pedalling experience.
1,Buy a different dictionary,"I bought this dictionary thinking that it would be useful. It wasn't. This dictionary is aimed at Americans who are already fluent in Korean and may need to use this only to look up an occasional word. If you are a beginner, spend the extra money and invest in better dictionaries."
2,A little too expensive; may be good for graphical novices,"This is an unimpressive collection of textures made all the less satisfying by their repetition on other Corel products. If you have CorelDraw or Corel Galleries, you'll have a lot of these textures already. Also, the price is out of line with the rest of the single-subject Corel Photo CDs, making it even less of a buy.Still, if you don't have many textures in your collection, this is a good enough and cheap enough way to beef up your supply. It's also a great way for graphical beginners to get ideas on how to make your own, so that you never have to buy a collection like this again."
2,Who's In Charge Here?,"Nearly two years after her final studio album, this live album was released. The results are less than satisfactory as this concert recording doesn't begin to reflect how very good Olivor can be, singing live. Having seen her concerts during this period, I can name any number of songs which were performed live but which are not reflected on this CD -- songs which far surpass a lot of the material here. Plus the cornerstones of Olivor's concerts (Some Enchanted Evening, L'important C'est La Rose, One More Ride, etc.) are not represented. Plus the godawful cover pictures, which SOMEone should have been fired for. Plus it's SO short. Plus the very harsh production (turn down the applause!). There are highlights -- Run For the Roses, Daydreams, Stay the Night. But the listener doesn't get any sense of how charming and funny Jane can be or how the heartfelt genius of her voice can be represented in concert."
5,No!!!! It can't end!!!!!,"This book was so sad. I feel so sorry for Rachel who died. She was my fave character. I cried for like 5 days!!!! At least she got a funeral. Hey, nothing never turns out the way you planned. Like leaving the book in a cliff hanger. It was a very good book."
4,It's The End???,"When I read number 53 I was hooked. I couldn't wait to read The Begining. Then when I read it I kept thinking ""THIS is the end to the great Animorph series??""Obviously if your an Animorph fan you have to read it, but still, after Jake found out about Ax the story went downhill. I thought he would get the whole team back together to rescue Ax, but he left Cassie behind, which I thought was kind of sweet. I missed Rachel and Ax in the book, but Rachel dying had to happen. Otherwise the whole thing would have been basic.Another thing, Applegate seemed too forget about her Animorphs when she started the EVER WORLD thing. I have never picked up an EVER WORLD book, and I know that I never will."
2,Hardly a favourite,"If you read this series, the ending is kinda necessary to have. But it's far from my favourite book in the series. Actually, least favourite would be closer to describing it. I may be biased because I was disappointed that the series was ending in the first place, but there's a cliffhanger ending! So many of the most interesting characters were just forgotten. Go ahead and buy it if you like the series, but don't expect anything outstanding."
5,"It was very good, but...","This book was very good. However, I had one complaint, and that was that it ended with a cliffhanger. The Animorphs fans, after reading this series for five years, deserve closure."
1,Terrible ending to great series,"As one the original Animorphers I was angry at this ending. I have no problem with Rachels death, and I like breaking up Jake and Cassie. Its problems are for one thing what they did to Tobias. He lived alone instead of with his mother who been looking for him since he was a baby. That made me mad. Also they listed every tv show they were on. WHO CARES!!!!!!!!! Then the Cliffhanger it ended with him saying Ram the Blade ship. Dumb thats no ending. Animophs rest in peace. This ending, the terrible tv show, and bad marketing prevented Animorphs from getting big. It could have been awsome. Movies, Toys, games it could have been big. It never got there most because of this ending."
5,"Animorphs: An amazing, thrilling read","To get things started: no, I'm not one of those people who work for the company that sells the product they're reviewing, and say, ""this iz da bom!"". (and I've bet you've seen a few reviews like that somewhere.) Well...anyway, this is the end of the Animorphs series, ironicly titled, ""The Beginning"". As one reviewer had said, in most books, the animorphs find out what's wrong, make a plan, every so often everything doesn't go right, they end up aggrivating the Yeerks. (if you do not understand the word ""yeerk"" there, I don't thing you should start out the series with this book.) This book was a very, very interesting read, and it had me hooked until the end. And, I wanted more. The ending is somewhat disipointing, and I mean no offence to Miss Applegate. I really enjoyed this book, and I can't wait for the next series by K.A A., coming out in June. I hope it's as good (maybe even better) then the Animorphs series."
3,"Great book, Awesome series, Miserable ending!","I LOVE Animorphs, save for a few issues here, and Cassie always really got on my nerves, but that's not the point. I, for the most part, loved hearing about what happened to the Animorphs and Marco's life of fame (LOL!) but the ending was TERRIBLE! You don't end and over 60 book series with such a cliff hanger! I would just like one more book to resolve what was left unsolved."
3,Kind of disappointing end!,"For me, it was a HUGE surprise when I read the book, the last of the Animorphs, it was totally different. Visser One living, Cassie and Jake breaking up, Rachel killed, Tom killed... And yet she meant it that way, to catch us off guard, with a totally different ending. Along with unanswered questions, like what happened to the Ellimist and Crayak, Toby, Aftran... That's why I deducted 2 stars, but the 3 stars are for the surprise ending, the impact it placed on it, and it's gripping suspense. Also, if you log on to morphz.com, you will find a letter from KAA herself, telling why she wrote it that way. Oh well. Let bye gones be bygones..."
1,Grade F-,"Not only is this Aerosmith's worst release, it's one of the worst cds of all time. The production, playing, songwritig, singing, and anything having to do with cd, is horrible. This was the first Aerosmith cd (record) I ever bpought. I would not touch Aerosmith with a 10 foot pole for years to come. Luckly PUMP caught my attention when it came out, and I started buying their stuff. I have even listened to the cd, thinking maybe it was the record that made it sound bad, NOPE."
1,Aeorsmith sucks without the original members,"I have to agree this is one of the worstalbum's ever recorded by Aerosmith.It's not Aerosmith without Joe Perry orany original member for that matter.To me they suck without Steven and Joe.Don't waste your money and don't just buy itcos'you want it for your Aerosmith collection.The only good song on here is ""Lightning strikes"".You're better off buying the best classic album's.Aerosmith,Get your wing's,Toy's in the Attic,Rocks,Draw the line,Live bootleg,Greatest hits,and Classic'slive 1 and 2,Done with mirror's and Gem's.Those are the best album's from Aerosmith inmy opinion from the 70's.Save your money and don't waste it on crap like this."
1,downward dog,"I got this video because all the reviews were so good. I was so disappointed because I didn't like this video at all. There is only one person to watch and she spends what seems like 85% of her time in downward facing dog. I thought I would keep the video for the 20 minute workout with a different instructor, but I've never seen such sloppy yoga in my life! Although he would remind you to breath properly, he was huffing and puffing like he was doing a cardio routine. The set is plain and dull and the music doesn't do much either. I exercise with different videos and dvd's everyday without fail so I feel like I know what I'm talking about. This video will not motivate you toward regular exercise.I have donated this video to my local library."
3,Turbocad is not an orphan,Turbocad has been around for a long time in earlier versions. The new 6.5 version is now out and it's still carried on the shelves of local stores (Best Buy) in both the entrylevel version and advanced.. the only other is entrylevel from Autocad.I had no trouble downloading an evaluation version of Turbocad 6.5 from their website.
4,Very Good,"It's pretty good. I don't even have Panasonic camera, but it fits my Canon. The wall charger is very convenient. Fast shipping."
4,If you like Cher's voice then you will love this cd!!!,"Cher's voice sounds wonderful wrapped around the electrifying title track!!! The remaining songs are a study in eighties rock/pop and are marginal at best. If nothing else, buy this cd for the cover!! The headband and sunglasses!!! My god, the sunglasses make it worth it!!!!!"
4,How True the Fiction,"A most enjoyable, fictional, historical account of life in the South during and after the Civil War. Enough truth to make it very believable and the author's descriptive terminology places you in with the characters so that you become very involved with the story personally. A lot of history is learned about Civil War military blunders that certainly effected the outcome of the war. I can understand why they made a movie of this book. It would be a good one to bring back as TV miniseries."
3,So Red Te Rose Opinion,Not the best anti-bellam book I have read. It got more raves than it deserved. I expected better than what it was. Sorry
4,This is NOTa karaoke disc,This is a CD of some of the most important and familiar Southern Rock available. These are the original recordings by the original artists. This is NOT a karaoke disc as described above.
1,Another example of Pope fiction,"This is a recent example of fictional work produced with an academic facade. The claims made in this book are contradictory to many public statements made by Jewish leaders immediately after WW-II. Consider the fact that Israel planted 860,000 trees in recognition of the over 800,000 Jewish men, women, and children that were saved from Nazi Germany by the actions taken by this courageous pope. Also, the leading rabbi in Rome converted to catholicism after WW-II and took Eugenio as his baptismal name (Pope Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli). This convert saw what the pope was doing and how effective his efforts were. Want more? Listen to episode 15 in this library of ""Pope Fiction"" - [...]Or buy the book by Patrick Madrid to get this story straight and many more.Pope Fiction: Answers to 30 Myths and Misconceptions About the Papacy"
2,The hero is really the villain!!,"This book is read-able. However, Justin is probably the meanest ""hero"" ever! I don't mind men who are mean in the beginning of the book but later come to their senses. I like the Alpha-male type. But the character of Justin was just horrible. He BRUTALLY rapes Arabella, degrades her, and he's never even really sorry about it. I couldn't even finish the book because I hated him so much."
5,Recommended to me by all of my coworkers,"I work for a company that repairs and distributes medical imaging equipment. All of my coworkers swear by this screwdriver for all of our electrical maintenance. I was hesitant to ""drink the kool-aid"" as they say, but once i received my wiha, i was a believer.The base rotates easily, allowing you to maintain pressure on the screw while torquing, but without abrading your palm. The shaft is wide, so you can spin the driver with the shaft instead of the handle. The base fits 6 bits, and the bits are magnetic. My coworkers showed me how you can stick a screw onto the tip, and then invert the driver so that it hangs from magnetic force alone.The package arrived a full three days before the amazon delivery date, and i was not expecting it.If you're looking for a handy screwdriver that you can stick in your pocket without stabbing your legs, hold screws securely, doesn't get slippery, and is safe for electrical use, this is the one you should get."
2,Not worth the time.,"I started reading this book on a camp trip, and only finished it because it was the only book I had. The author confuses the plot line by the introductions of too many characters, still adding them 2/3rds of the way through. Also, there are 2 plot lines of the detective's personel life which have nothing to do with the main story, with one of the plot lines being totally unbelievable. I don't recommend it.Don Stevens"
4,"Details, Details, Details","I use this textbook in my AP US II class, and I've found while trying to study from it that is almost too comprehensive. However, I particularly enjoy the 'How do historians know' sections of the text because I think it adds an element of realism to the text, as does the story of a person or persons at the beginning of each chapter. All in all, I think the 'Norton' (as we have dubbed it at school) is the perfect textbook for an AP History course."
4,A good history text,"We use this as the main text in my US History AP course. It's a good, fairly comprehensive, yet easy to read text."
5,I LOVE this boot,"i purchased this boot in dark brown leather. the first time i tried to get them on, it was a struggle of brute strength. once on, however, the soft leather and comfortable fit made them seem as though i had worn them many, many times. the boot works with everything from 501's to rock 'n republic! they're stylish yet comfortable. i couldn't be more pleased. my only problem is i wanna wear every day. maybe it's time for a 2nd pair?"
1,Two worlds of music,"First I would like to say that I greatly admire Constance Demby's talent. However, if you are interested in buying her CDs, be aware that her music falls into two vastly different worlds. Novus Magnificat, Set Free, Aeterna, and Sanctum Sanctuorum are rich in harmony and very uplifting. Attunement, Spirit Trance, and Sacred Space Music are atonal and reminiscent of a waking nightmare. Unfortunately Amazon.com does not make much of her music available for listening so it is difficult for someone new to her music to be aware that the mood of her work varies greatly. I would love to have her compose more music along the lines of Set Free and Novus Magnificat."
1,Attunement ??????,i bought the audio (cd) i appreciate her work HOWEVER!!!!!i feel this peice was more geared towards the Marilon Manson generation!!the tones of this dimension is underworld lower devitalized...
4,DOES ITS JOB,This laser level performed exactly as described. Perfect for the pocketbook as well. Drawbacks: 1) definitely requires two people to be productive in most leveling applications. 2) the base is way too light to use with anything other than a tripod. It can be done but work cautiously with a light touch.
3,Best Santana Pop Age Album,"This is argueably the best Santana album from his poppy 80's stage. The pop songs are of unusually high caliber, and the instrumentals are great. Also this album marks the return of Gregg Rolie for one song."
3,Something to Shango,"Although Shango is clearly not up to the old Santana standards, it has also been unfairly maligned. While the bulk of the tracks are relatively lightweight pop, Shango is more listenable and pleasant than many later Santana releases, including Supernatural, and the romantic numbers ""Hold On"" and ""What Does It Take"" substantiate themselves by putting some feeling in. ""Nowhere to Run"" is more innocuous than bad. My favorite is ""Oxun,"" a saga of deliverance but with only ebullient music. Still, the highlight is ""Nueva York,"" in which Gregg Rolie, the keyboard wizard of the group's early days, returns to provide some great Hammond organ flourishes."
3,A little meatier,Of all of Santana's eighties work this is a pretty good effort mainly though Santana's biting guitar work with a few nice jams.
3,accessible pop,"Carrack, a journeyman of the rock and roll sorts, finds a temporary niche with producer Nick Lowe at the helm.Suburban Voodoo is a forgettable album in the sense no one needs to own it, but for those who want a pure piece of 80's pop without replaying the same overheard radio tunes, or hits if you will, with a very recognizable voice coming through the speakers, this album is for you.Fun, pop, British and hit-ready, Carrack leads his band through tunes that are jumpy, catchy, lyrically intact, and well, just plain fun.Like Lowe? Rockpile? Brinsley Schwartz? Carrack's Suburban Voodoo will cast its spell on you."
5,Fantastic!,"This book is fantastic. Great recipes, easy to follow, nice pictures. Very well done! Great for gift giving for all occasions. Enjoyable!"
5,Wonderful Album,"If you are a Marty Robbins fan and can at all obtain this album, either on cassette or vinyl, by all means do so.I first found this on cassette in a used bin at a local bookstore and fell immediately in love with it. The condition of that copy was not great, and I then spend another 6 months looking for another copy, on vinyl this time. It was worth the search.The songs on this collection vary in style but are all worth listening to. Particularly memorable is American Dream, a story about a man who gives up the materialistic life that he had been living to go live on the beach in Mexico. It is stylistically like Jimmy Buffett. My other favorite is Lover, Lover, the last song. It has a very Spanish sound to it and reminds me of some of the song from the Zorro series from the 1950s.Definite 5 stars."
3,very powerful but not fun to clean that filter cup!,"I love that it is small and powerful, and it cleans wood floors as well as carpets, but it is hard to push and that filter cup gets filthy in no time. When I clean the filter cup (almost every time I use the vacuum) what a mess! Dust flying everywhere! That's the biggest drawback to this vacuum."
4,impressive,"Don't be fooled by its size or the toyish look. This is a mean vacuum cleaner. I compared its suction on hardwood floor against a full-size canister that was recommended by the Consumer Report. The Optima picked up as much dust as the canister, but at 1/3 of the price and 1/2 the weight and closet space.It is fairly loud, mind you, but the noise level is nothing out of the ordinary. And sure, the color is not to everybody's liking. But heck, no vacuum cleaner is likely to become the showcase piece in any household's decor.For its performance, price and compactness, the Optima is a winner."
4,lives up to its reputation,"after reading thru all the reviews i purchased this little vac.upon first sight i wondered how powerfull it could be,it was tiny!!!but after the first use i was sold....it works great! buy this vac u will be happy"
4,Great Little Green Machine!,"This little green machine is a little powerhouse! It's light, compact (with the retractable handle you can stash it in almost any small tight place--great idea!), and really gets down deep into the rugs! AND it's cute!!! (yes, I am a girl!) It was a breeze to put together and it did a wonderful job on my carpets that night! I only have a 2 rooms w/ carpets and 2 hardwood, so it's perfect for my small place. If you had alot of square feet, I'd go w/ a larger machine, but you have a small place--it's just the ticket! (Although, if you have a few floors in your house, for the great price-you could put one on each floor and never have to lug a machine up or down the steps!) I really liked the extension hose--it's really great quality (not that cheap plastic stuff you see on so many machines) and it stretches really far.Over all I definitely recommend it! :)"
3,good but not great,I bought this after the good rating it got on amazon. It has power but it is very hard to push along the floor.(harder than my 20LB vac) I plan on taking it back and get a different Eureka vac.
2,It was an okay vacuum,"I liked this vacuum okay for the price of the machine. It wasn't a huge investment and now it's not a huge loss. Where do I recycle vacuums? I use the past tense because the motor blew up due to dog hair. It worked relatively well on the rug, but I have wood floors and the vacuum spit the dust out the back. Then there was the adventure of chasing the dog hair, because as another review reported, the placement of the fan tended to blow the dog hair around the room. Oh, and did I mention that it is NEARLY impossible to buy replacement filters at the store; they must be ordered on-line...so plan ahead."
1,"noisy, blows dirty away and a small head","a. Machine makes more noise than our regular vacb. b. Exhaust blows dirt away. The fan blows out the air in front of the vac, so if you trying to vac something light, you will be running after itc. The machine head is smalld. No place to store the cordAfter reading all the fantastic reviews, I am wondering whether people have been paid to write all these good things."
4,"Works great, cord is a little short","The suction on this vacuum is awesome, and it's light and the retracting handle makes it convenient for storage. There's another review for this vacuum on here from an industry expert, read that one instead of mine."
3,Good Vacuum but High Maintenance,"The Eureka 431AXZ Optima worked real good the first 2 times I used it, then there was no suction. I found that the dust filter was clogged. The manual says the dust filter can be cleaned a maximum of 6 times, then it needs to be replaced. At $15 each, this is going to be expensive.Also, cleaning the dust filter and dust bin is very messy and time consuming. This is the first bagless vacuum I ever owned and if I had it to do all over, I would get a model with a bag.Other than that, it cleans real good. This vacuum is a good value, but very high maintenance."
2,Major design flaw...,"I bought it in a store without checking Amazon reviews first. As you've probably already read in other reviews here, the exhaust on this vacuum comes out the front. This makes the vacuum practically a useless noise machine on hard floor types. The dirt just gets blown around the room by the exhaust before it can get vacuumed. It's probably not as bad on carpeted floors, but that doesn't help me. I had to ""fix"" the vacuum with some plastic and duct tape to re-direct the exhaust upwards rather than forwards, and now it works fine. With my addition to the vacuum installed, I might give it 3-4 stars, but out of the box i would give it 1-2 stars."
1,Worst vacuum I have ever owned,"This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. It has great suction both on hard floor and carpet. But....the wheels fall off of it after a while. The hose is not long enough and comes undone while vacuuming, slinging out and hitting you and your furniture. The filter gets dirty entirely too fast. This is the second Eureka vacuum cleaner I have owned and it will be the last I ever own. Buy a Shark, trust me!"
2,Would not recommend,"I thought this lightweight upright would be good for my office. It's where we have the cat's litter box and the litter gets scattered all over the low, industrial-type carpet. It totally sucks (haha) at picking up the kitty litter. It mostly just scatters it around. The hose attachment is even worse; there is hardly any suction at all and I have to hold the hose directly over the litter to pick it up (you can't hold it at an angle, thereby cutting down on the amount of surface you have to cover).I don't use it on other carpeted rooms and I rarely even use it for its intended purpose. I usually drag out the big guns if I want it to really look nice."
3,sweep,Eureka vac is lightweight and easy to move around but very difficult to vacuum on carpet that does not have a hard surface. Too hard to push on denser carpet!!
4,good vacuum,I like this vacuum because it's light weight and it picks up pretty good. The handle can extend quite high so I don't have to bend over making it easier on my back!
5,Great vacuum for the money,"This is the second Eureka Optima vacuum that I purchased from Amazon, one for upstairs and one for down. I have three dogs and three cats and the house is always very hairy. This vacuum picks up everything. It was so easy to assemble. Took it out of the box and I had it together in about 10 minutes. I hate putting things together but this was easy. Didn't need any tools! It's light so you can use it on the stairs with no problem. I highly recommend this vacuum."
1,Who ever hated bags?,"When my vacuum died, bagless options were the only ones I found. Every time since, I've hated it. Dumping out the canister spreads dust, the filter gets gunked and clogged up in just one circuit around my small studio apartment, and for a light vacuum, pushing this one takes an inordinate amount of effort.Spend a bit more and get a self propelled one. Better yet, look for an antique with a nice tidy bag."
1,I wouldn't take this if it was free,"This has got to be the worst vacuum I've ever owned. It clogs all the time where the dirt enters the chamber and I have to clean the filter between each use. I've had this for over a year and within the first couple of months, it had lost suction. I imagine it would be an ok vacuum for a dorm room where there is very little area to vacuum. As soon as I can afford a new vacuum, I'll be putting this one on the curb. I wouldn't even give this away."
1,Useless!,"I bought this after reading everyone's glowing review...did we use the same vacuum? This cleaner is very powerful for its size...but it sits so low and has such tiny front wheels that it is sucked onto the carpet and can barely be pushed along with two hands! The beater brush has gaps between the tufts that completely miss animal fur and fuzz. If these two problems are corrected, this would be a fantastic machine but as is, it really misses the mark!"
2,Good if you want to be completely over-prepared.,"Even though my math and language skills are good, this study guide had me worried about passing the tests. But the English Language Skills section made me realize that there was simply no way a state certification test would use standards that were that vague. Some of guide's reasons for saying that certain answers were correct boiled down to 'we like the way it sounds better'. And some questions on the sample tests had me scratching my head, because all the choices were awful. Luckily, the actual GK ELS test used clear questions, and the answers were obvious to anyone with a good working knowledge of grammar and spelling. As for the math portion... well, let's just say I'm rather miffed about spending the time to study factoring polynomials when the closest thing to difficult math was subtracting the area of one shape from the area of another."
5,Great Help!,Very comprehensive for my needs to further my career choices and assist my family stability. Would purchase from again. Thanks
4,Excellent from a Master Commentator,"Harry A. Ironside wrote at least 25 books on the Bible, all commentaries and expositories. He excelled where others failed. His style was ""line upone line, precept upon precept"" and very rarely will you find fault in any of his books, this being one of them.This book is a masterpiece. I've owned two other study books on Revelation...and got rid of them due to too many mistakes and kept his. I am a very detail-oriented person by nature, so that says a lot to me, that I got rid of the other two and kept his.He is so in-depth in this book that it took me a long, long time to go through it. I had to stop, take a breather and go back to it again. If you want to find a ""mistake,"" the only one is that he makes comments about ""eternal security"", which is a Baptist belief, but if you can ignore that, his facts are 100% true (he writes about the ""eternal security"" in almost all his books)."
1,Self Published Crap!,"Self Published Crap!, September 22, 2006Reviewer: Cassandra R. Lockhart ""strcrosd"" (CA) - See all my reviewsI recently read this book a friend had. Wow Im really glad I didnt buy it! She actully suggests things like lying to people about your health saying your ""doctor"" wont allow you to have coffee so you dont have to explain your raw food diet to friends. Also, she makes it seem like a sin that people are ""addicted"" to food, well ya, we have to eat or we die, right? She suggests these ridiculously long fasts, describing that when her daughter was fasting she couldnt even hold her arms up any longer. She tells you to avoid places like coffee shops, movie theaters or anywhere else public where you may be tempted to eat ""forbidden"" foods, or even smell them! Anyway, I couldnt stop reading this book because it was so bad! I was just shocked at some of the suggestions, dont buy it."
1,Useless,Useless book. The author just rewrote 12 Steps. Boring to read. I feel I wasted my time and money.
5,time travel!!,"Steve and his sidekick Max land in central Arizona (in 1882) in the body of a famous actor and his friend newspaperman. The adventures of the next two days are both hilarious and, well, funny. Steve, while sitting in a barber's chair, happens to comment on the HUGE tumbleweed outside the window. Unfortunatly, the town's gunslinger happens to be in the same room. His knickname? The Tumbleweed Kid! OOOOOOPS!"
4,satisfied,"Set up was fairly easy and intuitive. The receiver works well as a pass through for my 2 HDMI connections (cable, DVD). Musically, it has some glitches which are elucidated in other reviews, but most can be worked around. The zone 2 audio can accept a digital source through analog cables (ie my external XM radio plugged in to the tape audio input through red/black cables plays and sounds fine). I imagine an iPOD will do the same but haven't tried yet. But you can't play a CD in your DVD player that's connected through HDMI. You do have to turn up the audio fairly high to hear it on main or zone 2, which I don't think is related to my speakers. It's inaudible below about -30, which begs the question what those first 30 levels are for? It won't rattle the windows, but it's plenty loud for a party.At the price range offered on Amazon w/ free shipping from J&R;, it's hard to beat unless you're a true audio or videofile."
3,extremely painful transaction,"the product is fine however the vendor is horrible.the box came all smashed up, not the outside shipping boc, but the product box. it looked like the vendor had this item in his closet for a few years. On top of that, the item was lost in shipping, then reshipped 4 weeks later after a montage or emails and stress.the product is great, the vendor is horrible. buy this from someone else!"
1,Wasn't funny until I turned it off,Raunchy and annoying. She has the most annoying voice ever. Degrading to both sexes. A poor attempt at stand up comedy
1,boo! and yes in a scary way!,funny right up until she got scary... No wonder she's single. This gal is bitter. Twisted would be a compliment.
2,I almost made it half way through this,"And that was a huuuuuge accomplishment. Maybe about 1 in 10 of her jokes actually made me laugh. She just comes off as a horrible person to be in a relationship with, and it seems like her life view is from the 90s or 80s."
1,Abslutely Horrible,Absolutely the worst comedy routine I have ever witnessed.Beyond stupid.Painful to watch.Irritating to listen to.Why would anyone make such a thing????
1,She's No Jenny McCarthy,"We kept waiting for the 'money shot' (as in, any kind of quick, gratifying expulsion of hilarity), but it never arrived. Suffered through 30 minutes of the grating voice and over-rehearsed schtick before finally giving up. Maybe Cummings would be better suited to a scripted sitcom on HDNET. For now, Jenny McCarthy can rest easy knowing her All-Time Kickass Queen of the Bombshell Comedians title is safe."
2,"Really liked it, until.......","This tool is very convenient to have around. Makes life easier when working with tiny screws and electronics hardware. However, recently the demagnetizer side no longer works? Kind of odd. Would give it 5 stars if worked the same as it did when I first received it."
3,Good Tool but 1-1/2 holes to much with alot of use!,"I fab and install handrailings. I have 2 of these and pretty much all I do with them is drill 1-1/2"" holes with spade style carbide bits. They lose there ooomph over time... under 1 year. I dont use them every day may be 3 times a week. I was told I can bring the ooomph back with the rebuild kit offered by Hitachi but at $60 to $70 for the kit every half a year ... it seems silly. They did work great (both of mine had the same problem)for a while but not long enough for me to buy again. I am switching to the 2"" makita spline drive.... I'll review that one later!"
5,CREEPY.........................................,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST FOREIGN, IF NOT OVER ALL, BEST HORROR FILMS EVER MADE. THE DVD INCLUDES THE THEATRICAL TRAILER AND BEHIND THE SCENES DOCUMENTARIES. A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!"
4,What scary used to be...,I saw this movie a few years back and loved it. It truly had me spooked throughout the whole film. I played it for a few friends and family one winter night (aged 15 through 70) and everyone was jumping and screaming from start to finish. It was great fun for everyone and they still bring it up to this day. I lent my copy out and (unfortunately) never got it back. Now I am buying it for the second time (I recently purchased a projector and this one will be played outside on the wall of my house). I seriously recommend this one!
5,QUESTIONS!,"Is this version of Ju-on only in Japanese or are there English subtitles? Also, is this the actual movie or the TV series because some of the comments don't make sense to me. I really love this movie but I just wanna make sure I'm buying the right thing."
1,"Ju-On, The Bore","Once more, we're presented with a heavily hyped horror import from Japan and asked to expect the most brilliant scare fest in a long time. ""Ju-On"" merely proves once more that Japan cannot make fright films. The ghost boy is a young kid wearing white make-up and mascara. He bulges his eyes a lot and you're supposed to be jumping out of your seats with a near heart attack. After watching this snooze-fest, I'm heading to the nearest multiplex to catch the American remake."
3,Protect Yourself From Prying Eyes,"Gee, I gotta say that I disagree with the other reviewers. I was expecting a LOT more from this book. Most of what I read is available for free on the web. That left about 4 pages that I could use. ( I'm glad for those 4 pages. ) But 218 pages of double spaced typeweritten text could probably be condsensed to 50 pages in regular type, subtract 30% fluff and filler (like personal recommendations for alternatives to trusts) leaves a very quick read. One afternoon should do it. I think its WAY overpriced. I don't need the 'free' newsletter, or the 'free' trust thats included. Caution is advised."
1,What a Rip Off,"This binder had 200 double spaced, single sided, huge printing pages for $145.Total rip off"
3,"The Good, the bad and the ugly","Actually I've used it often and the pasta was fantastic. However, clean up is not fun. The most disappointing thing tho is that if you need to make two batches... you need to start early. The machine makes one batch without a problem but the motor overheats shortly into the second batch and you have to let it sit for quite some time before it's useable again. Very frustrating if you have 3 or 4 or more to feed."
2,Deathly Boring,"Wonderfully staged, with brass musical pieces that act like a sonic massage, but the movie itself only held my attention with a handful of its 50-odd cuts. Critics seem to be more in love with their interpretations of this movie than being entertained in any way. At the very least, this movie should be loved for reasons better than ""outrageously hilarious!"" In a dream, perhaps."
1,camera has many flaws,"I purchased this camera 1 year ago, and I was so disappointed in the performance. The battery life is terrible, I took it to our town's Christmas Parade, and all the pictures are grainy and really poor quality. I posted some so you can see, also when you take a picture you can not take a picture for another good ten seconds. I had a two foot away shot of the rapper Nelly, and the camera didn't take the shot, and I only caught a shot of his tattoo on his arm! Save your money and get a better camera, like the Canon A630 the same price and much better quality, the battery life is fantastic and the night shots are great too. The shutter speed is much better too. I now have my HP in the closet because when I tried to use it on Thanksgiving the zoom would no longer zoom, and the lense does not retract. The only way I can turn off the power is too take out the batteries! I never dropped it or mistreated my camera, it is just not a good quality camera."
2,The camera with a glass chin!,"While I agree with others that this camera takes some pretty nice pictures and is easy to use, I've had the same problems as many have noted here. For starters, the thing eats through batteries like there's no tomorrow. I was lucky to get 20 pictures before the batteries crapped out. My biggest problem, however came when my son was handing the camera over to me at the dinner table and it slipped out of his hand. The camera literally fell only 10-12 inches to the table, but that was enough to render this camera permanently inoperable. Be warned: if you are a little bit clumsy or have butter-fingers, think twice before buying this camera! Red-eye reduction is also a bit of a joke with this one."
2,so-so camera,"This camera i have had for a while, and i personally think it stinks. It is somewhat heavy for this range. The mega pixels are only 5, zoom is only 3x, and it takes AA batteries. It's battery life is not very good, it is heavy, and overall i would not suggest it."
5,Release IT!!!,"I have also been watching the re-runs religiously after my girlfriend introduced me to it. I've watched every single episode from season 5-6 and now I'm starting to watch the older episodes from season 1. If the DVD boxed set was released, I would be one of the first people to line up to buy it"
5,Petition to NBC,I can't believe that are other stations are releasing TV shows that have not been on the air less than a year. Everyone should go to NBC and email them and let them know how you feel. I check Amazon.com just about everyday to see if it has been released yet.
5,"One of the best TV shows ever, and no dvd set,,,","What kind of crap is this!! Hillstreet Blues, NYPD Blues, The Commish, The Shield, but no Third Watch!! Disgraceful"
5,Third Watch is the BEST!,"I love Third Watch, and I really wish it would come out on DVD in the US. I'd buy it in a heartbeat! :-)"
4,Great Show!,This was a great show full of humor and tragedy. Realistic in that this is the way life is...good and bad shadowing each other. Thoughtful episodes and pretty good acting.
5,BRING THIRD WATCH TO DVD!!!!,Come on already! We are into season 6! Let's start cranking out the DVD sets of past seasons. Please?
4,third watch,Product was as promised with a timely delivery. I am satisfied with my overall transaction.
1,badly written and shallow scholarship,This orientalist account by an American who does not even know Arabic is a shameful example of what is wrong with western anthropology in its encounter with the Arab World. The work ignores the nuances of women's and men's lives in Morocco and simplifies complex realities so much that one wonders if the author even did any fieldwork in thecountry at all.The monarchy she represents--a repressive and brutal violater of human rights--is not even remotely critiqued and one gets the sense that the author does not care a great deal about those she writes about who must continue to live under this regime long after anthropologist leaves. An entire book about a regime that engages in systematic torture and not one word about torture or human rights abuses in the whole account? This shallow work is best ignored. Those interested in the dynamics the work tries to take up would be off reading Abdullah Hammoudi's work on Morocco.
5,A Very Powerful Book,"In Liz Rohloff's Novel 'Uncle Sim's she tells a very powerful story about drug abuse in a small midwestern town. Rohloff's story is about Derek and three of his friends.All four of them grow up to young adulthood never knowing the dangers of drugs. Until Derek discovers the one thing his father and mother had always wanted to keep him away from, Uncle Sim.In this riveting novel, Rohloff sends you into the dangerous and dark world of drug use. Uncle Sim's is a well written novel by a very talented lady. The book will keep you spellbound as you follow Derek through the dark and deadly world of drug abuse, as he struggles to find his place in the world. I recommand this book as a must read. I enjoyed this novel very much and I will be waiting for more from this very talented author."
2,Poor-fitting lid - generally poor quality,"I was very much looking forward to this saute pan and was disappointed in its quality. First, the lid did not fit well at all. I am not sure if the lid was warped, or the pan, but either way there were large gaps and the lid slid around without ""sitting"" right.Second, the quality did not seem on par with other Cuisinart Multiclad offerings. I have the 1.5 and 3 quart saucepans and couldn't be happier with them. The saute pan, in comparison, seemed to have a less-polished interior and a lighter, less-sturdy build.As a result, I am, sadly, returning this saute pan and saving my pennies for an All-Clad."
2,I so wanted to like this pan.........but,"I wanted a large pan that would suffice for one pot meals, one I could put in the oven if necessary. If I had the choice again, I would not buy this pan and would not recommend anyone purchase it.....unless of course you do all your cooking on low heat.Because 'low heat' is how you should cook with this pan, to paraphrase the warranty. My first pan warped; Cuisinart did send me a brand new replacement after about 3 or 4 weeks, but that replacement warped right away too. Rather than keep sending the darn thing back, I just live with it and wish I had popped for the extra dough and bought All-Clad.It is lovely looking, but not well made..."
2,Definite Miss.,"I know some people loved this DVD. Humor is mostly hit or miss, but for me, this had a lot more misses. I actually fell asleep half way through this one the first time that I saw it. I own a total of 4 Eddie Izzard comedy DVDs/Videos: Unrepeatable, Dress to kill, Glorious, and Definite Article. All of the first three listed I would list as 4 to 5 stars. This one just didn't strike me as very funny either in presentation or the jokes. My advice: If you own those other three and really loved those, get this DVD. It seems most (but not all) Izzard fans liked this one, so it would be worth checking out. If you don't own the other ones, check out one (or more) of those first."
5,I LOVE EDDIE IZZARD!!!,I don't think there's anything he could do I wouldn't like- Eddie is hilarious!!
4,Eddie Izzard - Definite Article,South Africans beware - this product won't play on your DVD player. We had to watch it on our laptop. Excellent and extremely funny. Can't wait to show it to all our friends.
1,Dead after 25 days,"Bought it on the 11th, and it's dead on the 26th. It was fine up until then - speedy, convenient, small, attractive, lightweight, and ran nicely with my Dell laptop. But a dead hard drive is less than worthless, it's a true pain. Now I have to recover everything from backups. Blah."
1,Awful Product,"Do not waste your money buying this driver, I Lost all my backup data... The hard drive always was treated very carefully.Six years of work wasted, THANK YOU Maxtor..."
2,I expected more from all the other 5 star reviews,I found the authors' tone as being rather smug (to the point of throwing this book down!)and beliefs rather Eurocentric. There are many gaps left for the reader to figure out concerning grade levels. Many of their curriculum recommendations are religious and being a non Christian I wish they gave other curriculum options. I don't agree with many of their views and I would advise anyone to ck this book out of the library first before purchasing. They don't value computer science/the use of computers as part of their curriculum (ofcouse being a 'Classical Education' guide!) It's an obnoxious book but maybe useful for some. Good luck
1,Worst Homeschooling Book,"The Well-Trained Mind is the worst home schooling book I have read. I am very thankful that it was not one of the first homeschooling books I read because most of it is impractical, irrelevant and sometimes ridiculous. This book is very narrow and appears to be unaware that children learn by doing, that learning is meaningful, and that there are many ways to learn. The only type of person that might benefit from this book is an exceptionally mature, gifted, daughter who loves to read and whose parents have an unlimited budget for homeschooling. If this is your situation, then ask yourself if you would want to limit her with this teaching style. To avoid disappointment, consider borrowing this book from the library before purchasing it. There are many wonderful homeschooling books; it is worth the effort to find the one that is right for your family."
5,The Best in Classical Education,The BEST home schooling book I have read so far. I want to share it with everyone I know. You won't be sorry you spent the money.
3,Good for a beginner,I purchased this book because I am new to home schooling and didnt know where to begin. A friend recommended this book as a reference guide. The author and co author are a little high on themselves and want to make sure you know how smart they are in the first few chapters. (Truthfully it gets a little old.)The book is good as a beginning reference to home schooling and can point you in the right direction. But you wont be able to complete everything they tell you to do or you may not want too. It lays out schedules and courses from pre K to college preperation but does not go into detail on how or where to begin if you arent starting from the beginning. The book only gives a paragraph per subject in the back in regards to starting home school at older ages but leaves you with many unanswered questions.I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a starting point but if you are a veteran I wouldnt waste my time or money.
2,A great disappointment,"I ordered this book after having heard and read many glowing reviews. Unless you are starting homeschooling (or supplementing) with a pre-schooler, you are too late to get much use out of this (very expensive) tome. You will most likely lapse into deep depression upon learning that you are at least three years behind in covering the essential materials if you begin at kindergarden age or later. Moreover, it is the type of learning plan which will be most appealing to those who feel that schools are deficient in testing and drilling, and that memorization is learning in its most perfect form. The references are outdated in many places, many of the materials and books reccomended are now out of print. All and all, an expensive disappointment in a slick and appealing dust jacket."
3,Not their best effort,"Kansas / Vinyl Confessions: While the lyrics are still top-notch, the musical arrangements are surprisingly poor. This sounds as if it might have been a very good album IF they had spent more time on it, had put more effort into the music itself. As it is, this is only a Three Star album."
5,BEST KANSAS ALBUM!,HAVE HEARD EVERY ALBUM AND AM CONVINCED THIS ONE IS THEIR BEST! DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE CD BY THE BAND KANSAS......EXCELLENT
3,One of the weaker Kansas albums,"I finally got around to buying this album. Although it has some decent songs, most of it really doesn't sound like Kansas. John Elefante's pop-oriented vocals are just plain out of character for the band. There are occasional moments where he does sound a little bit like Steve Walsh, but then he goes off on a pop tangeant. It would have been mcuh better if Robby Steinhardt did the vocals, or the album was instrumental. It's disappointing to hear so little of Robby on this (you really have to wait till the last track).The only genuine Kansas songs are Windows, Crossfire, and parts of Chasing Shadows and Fair Exchange. But even those are rather distant from the normal quality of Kansas songs. Even Play the Game Tonight sounds wimpy compared to the cool live version on Device-Voice-Drum.Recommended only for Kansas fanatics, or people who like pop music and need a watered-down version of the band."
4,Within the top 7 of Kansas' Albums,"The songwriting is good for the times but still stays orginal to KANSAS. There are no 7-10 minute master pieces, but the song ""Windows"" shows Livgren's musical chops are still thumping."
3,Weak for Kansas is still strong,"I realize that it is Kansas fan heresy to like the John Elefante years but, though its obvious this album was rushed, there are real gems here. John's Chasing Shadows is melodic and poignant, a Kansas specialty. Play the Game Tonight and Face It are solid rockers. John's voice certainly meshes well with Kansas sound, as anyone who saw them on tour with him should know. If you are a Kansas fan then you will find much to appreciate here."
3,Size doesn't matter,"This item is not all that bad. Sure, it's small but it works for what I need. When I have to dice carrots, celery or onions really small this thing does it's job. I would never try to crush ice! If you don't have the time to dice your vegetables get this product! You do have to chop your vegetables into small pieces but it will dice/mince for you. I haven't tried potatoes but I'm sure it will work as long as you don't try to chop a whole potato! What do you really expect for [the price]?"
3,Great - while it works,"I loved this item for the first month I bought it. It could chop items as fine as you please in much less time. However, I can't get the blades to stay in the slots anymore. After about a month, the blades would come lose while chopping and would bend as a result. Now they won't stay in the slots at all, so its useless. I really love the idea, but need to find a better quality design before I'll buy another one."
1,Slow Chop,"I bought the quick chop which promised to CHOP ice. Fifteen minutes, two bruised palms, and some watery ice later, I have my chopped ice. Maybe the fifteen minutes is a small exaggeration, but I would recommend using your good ol' refridgerator door ice machine instead of this bad boy.On a more positive note, it DID cut potatoes after being cut by hand into small chunks, but then I had to pry the chunks out from between the blades. Quick chop is not the right word for this device."
5,ZANE - What a wonderful story!,Zane MacKenzie is a wonderful guy in this story. I loved the way he encouraged Barrie to take control of his body! I can't wait to read the story about Chance -- he sounds even better! Enjoy MacKenzie's Pleasure it is a true fantasy!
5,Visually stunning!,"After searching used bookstores and libraries for four years, I was finally able to obtain a copy of this book. From dragons to a gnome chicken-plucker, you will find it all in this compendium. It is interesting to see the design process of the artwork and read their creators' insights. The paintings are dazzling. These artists are truly talented to be able to capture the raw emotion and thrilling action from memorable scenes of the Dragonlance saga onto canvas. ""Death of Sturm"" by Larry Elmore, ""The Last Spell of Fistandantilus"" by Keith Parkinson, and ""The Portal"", also by Larry Elmore are striking examples of this. ""The Art of the Dragonlance"" is a fine companion to your Dragonlance collection."
4,Practical,"I purchased this with the intention of storing multiple decks of MTG cards and other decks from other card games. Even though the picture depicts a foam insert, it had a hard cardboard insert instead. It makes no difference to me since it will serve the purpose I need it for. It is a rather large carrying case so this would be best suited for players who have many decks or anticipate to attain more decks. For more information on this product, I would refer to one of the other reviewers here who was kind enough to provide a video review."
3,ultra pro gaming bag,i placed an order for this ultra pro zippered gaming case and in the picture it has a foam inside but upon recieving it i find out it does not have the same product as hte picture describes. i desired a case which had a foam interior. i am disappointed that the picture is innacurate of what i actually recieved and paid for. Delivery was very accurate but the product was not as describedthank you for your time this was the only way to for me to be heard on this issue.
2,PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS WRONG!,"I bought this case and it said that it had 5 deck spaces and an oval center (one main reason i got it in the first place to replace my Ziploc bag) for dice and counters, but what i got was a zipper case like the picture shows, but on the inside was not a foam inside nor was there even an oval space for dice and counters, but instead cardboard 6 spaces for decks, now i can handle cardboard, but no oval space is a pain in the ass.....i am keeping this product but only because after reading reviews they said the foam and oval part were discontinued and made the current 6 deck spaces. I have no choice really i need this case for tournaments for magic cuz its easier than carrying my heavy duffle bag."
4,"Great, yet not everything that i ordered","This carrying case is the ideal thing for trading card people. It holds so many decks and cards that it's just ridiculous. Though i was very disappointed. The second picture of the product showed that the case was supposed to come with a foam insert that would have an oval slot to hold like dick and such, but mine did not come with this. Maybe this is why the case is quite a bit cheaper than all the other. But since this was only like $20 compared to the $40 and up on all the others, I say this is a great buy for the true card game players such as I. I play Yugioh and magic, but this case will work with any type of card."
5,Inner Peace,This cd takes me to a place of inner peace. It brings about a state of deep relaxation. Smooth flowing with heart beat like drumming. Great for meditation.
4,It's a good product,"I love my Perfect Pancake maker. I've had mine for 1 1/2 years. I had some of the problems the other people have had when I first got it (like the batter falling out the sides or cooking too much on one side), but after a while you get the hang of it & it makes GREAT pancakes. The only problem, the non-stick coating is nonexsistent. You'll want to use cooking spray! Good luck! I loved it!"
1,Perfect Rip-Off,"The metal is sooo thin, which of course heats unevenly, so you get a burnt spot on your otherwise raw pancake. If you do manage to create an edible product, you'll be rewarded with plenty of 'non-stick' flavoring thrown in as an added bonus."
1,Buy a griddle instead.,"After reading the other reviews I agree that this is a piece of garbage. I had two of them (to speed up the process) but after this morning's fiasco left a mess of pancake batter all over my stovetop they are both in the garbage. It worked well the first time I used it making perfectly round pancakes. However, after a couple of uses the pancakes would stick to the pan and burn. Pancakes may look ready, but then you try and flip them and pancake batter runs out all over the place. I wish that I would have read the reviews before I bought this. They were a real waste of money ( or I guess you could say I got my money's worth because it did save us money by having breakfast at home rather than going out.) The dispenser doesn't work too well either so I didn't use it. I think a griddle would work much better, and you could cook several pancakes at a time."
1,Another TV [let-down],"Save your money. This thing is a joke. Pancakes stick, non-stick coating comes off after just a few washings using a mild detergent and dishcloth,and the handle snapped off the last time it was washed. Not to mention the attempt at making eggs over easy; it was eggs all over the kitchen!! Some much needed improvements would be no gap between the two halves and better quality handle, and more Teflon coating.The concept is a good idea, but it needs work."
1,It's aweful!,"We bought it thinking it would be non-stick as advertised and we could just pour, flip, then slide onto a plate as demonstrated on TV. How wrong we were! We didn't have any 'batter flying out the side' problems - instead we couldn't get them out of the pan; the pancakes stuck horribly and caused a huge mess when we tried to get them out. My best friend wanted to try and she had all the same problems. This product ended up in the trash and was a total waste of money."
1,Not so Perfect Pancake,"This was a total waste of money. A plain old skillet works much better. The ""non-stick"" surface is not non stick. The pancakes either stuck to the top or spilled out when I tried to flip them. I tried to give it to my son, but he didn't want it. I was amazed at how bad this product really was."
1,Totally agreed with other people here,This is such a waste-money/time-products.It does not work. Don't even bother!!
1,A ZERO STAR should be an option - Just awful,This product has been the worst thing I ever purchased. The pancakes stick and the uncooked batter comes out when flipping the pancake over. I cleaned up the mess and tried again of course it still didn't work. Save your money; if you really must try this product check out your local garage sale.
1,If you can spell Mustang do not buy this book,"This book is good for someone who knows little to nothing about mustangs.For anyone who actually wants to modify one, do not waste your time. This book is very generic. SH rambles on touching lightly on various subjects but not going into sufficient detail on anything. I expected a list of the different years and models with all the stock specs at the least, but it is not here.Whereas his book on building Modular Motors was a wealth of information, this one is very disappointing."
3,A Pure Wrestling Game,"this is not your typical wrestling game. if you can hook a submission hold on someone it takes them out.....imediately. and you have to wear down your opponents before attempting some moves because otherwise they will counter them. however,because of some of these the game loses points. when you start off the matches will be short. either you will totally kick butt or you will totally get you butt kicked. when starting off the game is not easy,but if you give it a little time it will grow on you."
2,the best infleuential movie of my childhood,"I had seen this movie when I was in 10's. I was so touched, I've never forgotten this film since I ever had. It made me think about ""truth love"" and ""soul mate"" even though I was too young. After all, It comes to the best infleuential movie of my childhood. Recently, I found it by my contry websites that related movie. I'm so surprised. 'cuz ..I thought that mostly people in my country(I'm a korean) didn't watch. but A few remember it. They almost said ""It's really good one""I absolutely agree..! I wish movie goer shouldn't miss it!!"
3,Wide range of exercises for all levels,"My favorite instructor from here is Stephanie Vittorino. She leads only 1-10 minute segment: Ultimate Buns and two workouts of the ""bonus workouts."" Other than that, the very energetic Cindy Whitmarsh leads a decent 20 minute upper body weight workout-very fast paced,but has lots of compound exercises for time efficiency. If you are into power moves, heavier weights, and are more advanced see the Marco Reed workout, ""Upper Body Cardio."" In the ""Buns & Abs Toning"" workout, I skip the abs section because the trainer, Meredith, is not attractive. She is fully covered in black and does those high school sit-ups progression style! There are varied sit-ups, but the basic position is to lift up to your bent knees. There is also straight legged sit-ups ,too. Too bad that Meredith continues those undesirable sit-ups in the bonus workouts, but only for 2 minutes. All in all, I only frequent Cindy Whitmarsh's workout,FIRM UPPER BODY."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"Maybe someone would like this DVD if they are new to exercise or want a very basic and extremely low intensity workout. I bought it because it was cheaper than most other prego workout DVD's and need variety. Kira seems very nice, but doesn't seem to have a lot of teaching experience. It is easy to follow and safe, but can't see it getting a lot of use in my house."
5,A singer with great talent,"Everything other reviewers have said about his voice is true. He has a terrific voice and has learned how to use it with great skill. This is no pop icon who relies on recording engineers to make him sound good - he is a real singer. Also worth mentioning is that the songs are musicially interesting (not always the case with pop music) and his lyrics are written in a way that speaks to everyone: women, men, straight, gay. I'd rate this the best pop album of the year. Some of the ballads are heartbreaking. Here's hoping we hear more from Anthony Callea!"
3,frustrated,"I was unhappy to discover that our computer is not powerful enough to run this game. Apparently you need some really high-end technology to play. They cannot even upgrade our computer to play this. I can't tell you about the game, because we can't play it."
3,"Lives up the hype, but then again it doesn't","For me TES4 Oblivion was a game to be played once since in one game it was possible to do everything in it. It's more like a boring typical fantasy storyline sequel to Daggerfall than one to Morrowind. Had the main quest been more interesting the game would have fared better in my opinion.The Pros:Combat was a lot of funSome of the side quests, like the guilds were interesting (except the mages)LongCan be modedThe game's graphics are just eye candyThe Cons:LongThe main story line was really hackneyedVoice actors were constantCan't fight on horsesLeveling monstersSpell system could have used some workMany of the quests were repeats from previous Elder Scrolls games"
3,"good game, but thats all","In my oppinion, this game is good, not great. The graphics are groundbreaking true, and the voice acting and backstory is supurb, but to returning players this game lacks much of the ""feel"" of its predecesors. The game mechanics have been ""simplified"" (dumbed down) and characters seem less customizable, except for appearance of course,(face, nose etc) which is fully customizable. The main and almost sole problem I have with the game though is level scaling. The enemies get tougher universally as you level up, taking the drive to improve in the game out. I actually died more at level 20 than at level one. This has pretty much killed any reason for me to play the game, and I fear, unlike the last installment, Morrowind this is a game I won't be finishing."
3,Bummer,"I just finished what is probably my last session of Oblivion and will most likely not play again. This game has the great graphics, great physics engine, but it doesn't have that ""grab you"" feeling the Morrowind had. I played Morrowind for more hours than I want to admit, and then I played it some more, finshed it wiht different characters and it was always interesting. It seems as though Oblivion tried to please to many people though. They took out some of the most fun parts like levitate, and added a totally confusing NPC interaction wheel. I put a good 20+ hours into it because I wanted it to be as good as I remember Morrowind, but it just isn't. I will go back to playing World of Warcraft with my free time."
2,Huge disappointment,"If you've ever played morrowind spare yourself this travesty. It's so dumbed down that it's not even fun.If this is your first elder scrolls game, you'll probably like it. It is unfairly tailored towards xbox users and inept/beginner gamers. I wasted $72 on it (next day shipping) and still feel the pain weeks later.If you are intelligent, do yourself a favor and get Morrowind Game of The Year edition for $20. If you are a child or a casual gamer, then by all means get Oblivion, you will enjoy it more."
4,Interesting history book,"This book's subtitle is a little misleading, as the book has much more to do with the *history* of Celtic Christianity than its ""spirituality"". But it contains a whole lot of great stories and fascinating characters."
1,Did not work,"Motor started to turn then stopped. Now, it only makes noise. Also, the part didn't contain an OEM sticker so I assume it wasn't a factory part."
1,Not pictured item,"Received this item today. It is DEFINITELY not the pictured item. It's not the same shape, color or materials. It's rather disappointing as we've waited for it to arrive in Japan."
2,Works for kids not for combat,This is a super cheap tube taped to another cheap tube in a cheap nylon like sac no big deal I needed a quiver for combat assaults and stuff this one is not it with the belt clip and stuff it's not tactical at all no good for combat and assaults but ok for kids
5,Really handy to have.,It kept all the arrows organized and quickly accessible. It didn't get in the way or feel awkward hanging by the hip.
5,What a Cute Book!,This is such a cute book that promotes a positive self-esteem in girls. I started reading it to my daughter while I was pregnant with her. It's one of our favorite books to read together.
4,A Cute Look at Reality,"I purchased this sometime ago for our daughter and I think at that time it did not connect with her as deeply as it does now. Since she is the only girl in her class of her ethnicity, she understands and appreciates her hair and the many facets of styles and textures her hair can take on. The last time she read the book it generated very positive discussions for her.Simple TruthSimple Truth Too: Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star"
4,Loving Your Hair,Natasha Anastasia Tarpley introduces us to Keyana in her book I LOVE MY HAIR! It is an account of Keyana's displeasure of the nightly ritual of having her hair combed. Her mother tenderly coddles her and washes away her cries with words of comfort and pride in having hair that can be styled in any way. She shares stories with her to help the time go by and to take Kenyana's mind off of her hair.I LOVE MY HAIR! is a beautiful story of mother and daughter and instills pride in oneself while at the same time validates the importance of bonding with your children. The illustrations of E. B. Lewis vividly display various hairstyles and the flowing words of Tarpley's story.Reviewed by Tee C. Royal ofThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers
5,Life Changing Book,"This book has literally changed our marriage and our lives. Dr. Weiss gives such practical down to earth suggestions that anyone can implement. One thing that I especially loved is that he makes you choose to work on your marriage or choose to do nothing and watch your marriage suffer. A successful marriage takes work and complacency is shown for what it is, a choice to let your marriage suffer.Dr. Weiss recommends this book as a 100 day guide, but after implementing the principles laid out in this book, I do not know who would want to stop.I have read many great books on relationships by best-selling authors and always been left asking, ""That sounds great, but how do I put it into practice?"" No theory here, just sound principles that anyone can start doing today.I am recommending this to all of my married friends as a must read."
1,Brought me to tears!,"stunningly, amazingly, and in all otherways stupid. Not an educational film -- a mystic new age philosophy wrapped in a guise of Judaisiam. Watch out for the Airplane!!!"
2,Nothing Much Here to Hold Your Interest,"I was really looking forward to reading this book (my first by Highsmith) because it was recommended by a good friend with similar taste in novels. Unfortunately, it did not come close to my expectations. Put simply, not much ever happens throughout the story. Further, there really isn't any suspense about the ultimate outcome and none of the characters are particularly likeable or compelling."
2,So much potential...,"Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down. A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution. What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the ""cat and mouse"" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short. In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close..."
4,Steve Miller Take Note,"Supposedly recorded for about $700 Lovey Dovey All The Time has some of the most simple, gorgeous and unpretentious love songs I've heard in years. Picture Her Face and Glenn Miller are the top of the lot, with Glenn Miller's acoustic guitar and cello demonstrating how a small budget can sometimes be an advantage. England doesn't mess up the beautiful sparseness with extra accompaniment. Love is treated as a serious subject throughout but there's welcome humor in the form of She Loves Kurt Cobain. England will take abuse from the fanatical with this perfect pop gem, which is still ringing in my head days after the last listen. Chatterbox is a good idea that gets too cute, and Downwind is a bit flat but on the whole it's a fine, charming CD with equal does of rock and pop. Next time give the man an even $1,000 and see what he can do."
2,Not good at all compared to Mothers or Mequires.,This stuff only works well if you wipe it off IMMEDIATELY. If you leave it on the paint to dry.... good luck getting it off.
5,Wonderful product from a trusted name!,"Just to make sure everyone understands first off that this is a ""cleaner wax"" and not just a regular wax. I received this about 4 days ago and applied it right after a clay bar treatment. The product goes on easily and comes off with little effort at all. The result was a beautiful glossy shine. I followed it up with a coating of sealer and then a final carnuba wax treatment. The results were amazing! Zymol is the way to go if you can afford it. Don't waste your money on the cheaper products."
5,short and to the point,I was pleased by the response my 3.5 year old son had after reading this book. He definitely got the point that being polite counts and it isn't so hard to say please and thank you!
4,History buffs read this book!,"I read this book for a history class in college. Mostly the book focused on the differences between the Indian way of life and the settlors ideals. The book was very descriptive of the landscape and it prompted me to visit the area written about (now it's Springfield, Illinois!). The book is non-fiction yet allows you to follow the characters through life as if it were fiction. I would recommend Sugar Creek to anyone interested in American History."
2,extremely uncomfortable,"i'm a huge fan of sennheiser headphones, and have been using the lighter, open-air model for years... only problem with those is that i've now seen 3 pairs break at the point where the earphone meets the neckband... i thought i'd upgrade... although the sound is great, i found that these started to hurt my head after just an hour.... unfortunately, they're extremely uncomfortable..."
3,i had such high hopes,"The sound is pretty good I think, and the major concern I had was that these would isolate the sound so that I would stop disturbing other people -- I like loud loud music and I listen to it everywhere -- and these headphones are great for those things. But they are soo uncomfortable. Not for the first 30 minutes or so, but I keep headphones on for hours at a time, and these I just have to take off after a while because they just are killing my ears. And they look like they should be really comfortable...anyway if you listen moderately like a normal person (or whatever) then these are highly recommended as a middle of the line product, but for marathon sessions I'd look elsewhere."
3,OK Headphones,"These cans aren't bad, good treble and mids, but the bass is terrible on my 8GB Ipod. I've ""broken them in"" and still any bass heavy song distorts and sounds crappy. The bass improved over time, but I recently purchased the AKG 26 Ps (same price) and was blown away by how much better they sound than the 200s. If you are not into bass, then these cans will serve you very well. But I like bass heavy songs to work out to and I was constantly getting frustrated with the poor bass reproduction on these phones. If you want all sounds including good bass, I highly recommend the AKG 26s. They are not wrap arounds though, but for me the difference in sound quality made it a no-brainer."
2,"good product, poor durability","I enjoyed these headphones for 3 months. Overall sound quality is very good, bass is good but not excellent, comfort is not great, but you will get used to them after a few weeks. They block out outside sounds which is important in noisy urban environments. Unfortunately, after 3 months, the headphones began sounding like everything was playing underwater. I now have to go through the hassle of getting them repaired, and Sennheiser charges $30 for repairing them. Compare this with buying new headphones at $45. I'm not happy about that."
4,Almost a 5 star cd,"The only negative thing I can say about this Remastered version is that it does not contain the ""Yes I Do"" from the original US release. Other than that, it is stacked. Ever since the E.P. came out on vinyl that had ""Aeroplane"", I wanted it on cd. Now I have it, and it's remastered to boot. This is an awesome cd. You will not be disappointed."
5,Love it!,It isn't sticky or greasy and has no strong smell. I use it for my skin and even as gel for my hair. I usually mix vitamin E oil with it because my skin is very dry and it cuts the edge off the greasiness of the oil. I love this stuff!!
4,My favorite Koontz book,"I was intrigued by this story of a simple pastry chef with a prediction of five terrible days hanging over his head. The terrible days come in the form of an insane clown with the unlikely name of Konrad Beazler and his son, Punchinello. Konrad raises Punchinello to be the worlds greatest clown but the lad can't even take a decent pratfall."
4,Well written but less intense,The story moves along nicely and is very well written. It is less frightening and intense than some of his other books.
2,Life Expectancy,"I have read & enjoyed other Dean Koontz books so I decided to read this one. Mistake. At least the first quarter of the book has to do with the first of 5 predicted ""bad"" days in Jimmy Tock's life. After this many pages, it got to be boring and I soon lost interest in the book. There are too many other good reads and other things to do that are more interesting."
3,Really wanted to like it,"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years now. I've enjoyed the suspense and even the schmaltz, but this novel is one of my least favorites. I hate to say it, but as much as it is used in the novel, humor is it's downfall. Unlike most of his books, Life Expectancy plods along especially where the use of humor serves to drag out the story instead of pull it forward. Normally, I read his books quickly and enjoy every minute of it, just not this one. Instead, the humor seems to make the story fall flat and unrealisticly like a badly done pratfall. Koontz has done better work and created better characters. I think I'll go an re-read Lightning again."
3,"Have not read it yet, BUT...","...I am a big Dean Koontz fan and have read several of his novels (liked them all). However, I may skip this one. Based on all the reviews (the good ones), it appears to be a comedy. I want to read Koontz for thrills, suspense and horror...if I want comedy, I'll watch tv."
4,Made me hungry!,"All that talk about pastries - yum! It was a good read but I was disappointed that the ""5 Days"" were all linked to the same evil man. I would have liked to see five completely different events."
1,I really did try to like it!,"I've recently started reading Koontz and while I think he's a good writer, I just could not get into this book! It started out well and then became just plain stupid after awhile. I like the way the author uses humor, but there was too much ""aren't we quirky"" cuteness about the protagonist's family for me to feel anything for them. I don't usually skim through books, but I finally had to for this one (and when I got to the end, I wish that I had just given up earlier)."
3,Not your typical pastry chef,"Read like a farce on typical horror/mystery books, and I enjoyed all the tongue in cheek and pastry references.Easy non-scary read, bizarre characters, unusual reactions and life stories, quite odd from beginning to end.That's what kept me reading it, wanted to see what other twists sprung out of nowhere."
1,TERRIBLE,I could not even get into this book! It was slow and stupid! I would never even try to read it again let alone buy it!
2,Totally predictable,"While I am not ready to give up on Koontz (I will still buy every book he writes, at least for the near future), this book was totally predictable. I could see the plot twists coming a mile away. But it was a fast read, so I was not too invested in the characters. I would also like to have had more insight into Jimmy Tock--what on earth did Lorrie see in him? I get the feeling that Koontz was just reeling this one out to have a book out at this time of year--it started out well, but went downhill, with short shrift to lots of later parts."
4,Quirky and Fun,"When I first began reading this book I figured it would be one of Mr. Koontz's latest strange, overly-descriptive novels that would be forgotten soon after I turned the last page. However, the more pages turned the more *enchanted* I became. There were several interesting plot twists that never became too convoluted and all in all it was a terrific read. I've read all of Mr. Koontz's books and he has evolved into a cheerful suspense novelist, completely different from his earlier works, but instead of being disappointed I find I enjoy his new books in a different way. This book is worth the money and a nice addition for any fan. Good work!"
3,Classic Koontz.,"Good read, but, as always seems to be the case with Koontz more often than not, he tends to ""overcook"" the plot as the story progresses to borderline improbable.Nevertheless, with the signature style of narration, the fans won't be disappointed."
5,Superior Quality,"I have installed billiard tables with regular levels for nine years. I used the Stabila Electronic 40"" Level and cut my total installation time by 1/3. I would highly recommend this tool, and would buy another."
4,Off the Beaten Path,"Not his classic ""Hits"" by any means, but some good stuff from a legend. At least one track, ""The Reverend Mr. Black"" is not available anywhere else. It's worth the price."
4,Nine West Peep Toe,These are nice and comfortable. Easy to walk in. I have only had to wear them out once so far but I was quite happy with them. Nine West tends to make nice shoes.
2,"Has to be glued, does not snap tite","My son (age 12) picked this for his first try at putting a model together. We picked a level 1 so he would not get too frustated with the effort. While he did have fun putting it together and he is happy with the outcome, it was frustrating because most of the parts had to be glued in order for it to stay together. This was especially true for the landing gear. Also some pieces broke easily which required more gluing to repair. As long as you are prepared to glue it you should be happy with it."
2,dissapointed!!,"Model was easy to put together but pieces do not stay together very well. Was missing the canopy to the cockpit which is unacceptable. Not a bad model, but could be better."
2,ORANGE decals??,"Our model kit did come with a canopy, but we will be returning the kit for another reason. The Blue Angels, as everybody knows, wear a blue and yellow paint scheme, but the decals that came with this kit are ORANGE."
1,Horrible kit.,"As others have stated, save your money and do NOT purchase this kit. I purchased this kit to build with my six year old and we are both terribly disappointed. I had previously purchased two Revell Star Wars snap kits and they are both top-quality. Unfortunately, this kit is exactly the opposite. Gluing will be the only option for much of this, and even then it was too much effort for a Level 1 kit. Save your money and look elsewhere."
4,surge outlet,This surge protector was exactly what I was looking for. It has a good combination of regular plug outlets and block outlets.The price made it a good value compared to what is out in the marketplace.
1,Only half functions,"From the day I received this product, straight out of the box, only 6 of the outlets worked. So it's basically half paperweight half power strip. Since Belkin requires that you pay to send it back, I've just used it as a 6 outlet power strip ever since. Recently, however, a power outage caused the 'Not Grounded' light to come on and stay on. I'm told I need to return it for a new one. So I'll have to pay the pretty expensive (about half the cost of the strip itself) shipping costs to return it. Isn't is meant to withstand power outages? Isn't that the purpose of the product? Very disappointed, wish I could just return it."
1,lemon,"Item caught on fire with no appliances on. No evidence of surge on same circuitat other locations in home. Fortunately, someone was in room and smelled burningcalled me and I pulled plug. Plastic burned and deformed. For this type of failureBelkin should pay for pick up and replacement and perform failure analysis. Asthe expense and time of returning exceeds value $18, it will be tossed out.Reviewer is an electrical engineer."
4,Solid Performance,"I have connect almost everything through this surge protector. Several storms, power-outs have pass by and this looks to provide safety for sure. Worth the price !"
5,Just What I needed,12 outlets with a footprint that takes up not much more room than an 8 outlet surge protector. Perfect to handle my power needs and keep my cords managed nicely.
5,good,"When I bought this product, I took a very good discount, and the quality of this one is pretty good I think. Definitely a good deal."
1,Quit Working After 3 Months,"When I bought this in September, 2012, I thought this was a great way to protect my new Samsung 60 in. TV and Home Theater System very recently purched from Amazon. It completely quit working in December, 2012, after only 3 months. Of course the return policy per Amazon is only 1 month so too bad for me. I just ordered a replacement one made by Monster and hope for better results."
4,Good product,"Love having 12 outlets, and the 10' cord is nice too. Don't use the phone/ethernet or cable input/outputs though. The digital broadcast signal gets too low for ABC when running through the surge protector, and there were issues with our DSL when running the phone line through. Otherwise, it is great for the 12 outlets and 10' cord!"
5,Blows my Rocketfish out of the water!,"I bought a Rocketfish Surge Protector which requires a Master Controlled item to be on permanently. This method was very ineffective for my application. So, I purchased this Belkin! It works great! No more issues with my WiFi shutting off."
2,I probably need to look at replacing this.,"We bought this because we required a power outlet/surge protector with a longer cable. However, some of the outlets just don't work. I've checked the protector itself and it seems like it's functioning properly. I can swap outlets for some of the items plugged in and they will magically start to work in one outlet where it didn't work in a different one. I have no idea. It's very annoying. Had I realized this issue when we first got the item, I would have returned it."
4,Works great so far,Easy to connect and access when needed. Handled everything I plugged into it and withstood ten power surges in a day during a recent storm.
1,I never received it!!,I was told there wasn't sufficient quantity and so as an apology they would give me a 25 dollar gift certificate. I received that and it's only good for 30 days. At least I was reimbursed I guess
4,"Bigger than expected, Does the job","This is a little wider than I expected but does the job perfectly. You'll need about 6-8"" of clearance if you're using power bricks on the outside plugs. Other than that, it's exactly what I needed and a great price. Lay flat wall plug is a nice touch. Longer cord is exactly what I needed in addition to the extra plugs."
4,Great Surge Protector,"This Surge protector was exactly what I needed. I really like The extra spaced outlets for Adapters. The only feature I didn't like was the on/off switch, it's on the side where the cord comes out. While moving the surge protector behind my desk to hide all the plugs/cords I accidentally turned it off several times. It's not a problem, just unusual placement being used to ones with the switch on the top where the outlets are. Overall it's a great product and suits my needs nicely."
4,Best to have,"Since we had a power outage, I checked the date on the last one I purchaced (important to put a date on this type of product) as they won't last forever, so for the safty of my HDTV and cable box, I bought a new one."
2,surge protectoor,"Works as described except line protector doesn't work with DSL to the modem. So I have to link the phone line directly to the modem which potentially leaves the computer, modem and router vulnerable to a power surge."
5,Power Packed,This is a kick butt wonderful surge protector. What I love the most about it is the variety of directions you are able to insert a plug.
2,Joyce's item,Item arrived damaged. Cord/cable organizer clips on end were broken off. Item was poorly packaged.
2,disappointed,"Unfortunately I bought two. Very cheap materials and finish-Plastic is ""soft"" -- any kind of pressure, even a fingernail, will cut into it-Finish is full of imperfections (one of them has a bump on the side)-Outlet covers are extremely flimsyThey actually look and feel worse than $5.00 surge protectors from Walmart - but I just got them and have not had an event that would test their behavior. If they actually perform during a surge, I will re-rate to raise their grade."
2,Very small for different sized plugs.,I am giving 2 stars for the tidy design.Pros:It was well design so that it can accommodate more plug head as many as it can.Cons:It cannot accommodate plugs with different sizes
5,Great Value,"Belkin has always made a great product, combine that with the great prices at Amazon, and you have a combination that can't be beat."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought two of these surge protectors. The first one I plugged in and plugged something into it, and it blew the surge protector. I took the second one and plugged the same appliance into it and it is still working. Not sure why the first one blew, but it's going back to Amazon. Hopefull I won't have any problems with the second one, though I am still waiting."
3,If you don't care internet connection then it is good,"There is a serious problem with this product:The coaxial and Ethernet protection downgrade the connection speed, after installed it, my internet connection slow down from 12mbps to 5 mbps down load, after I removed it connection back to normal. so if you don't care about the network connection then it is good, otherwise, buy something else."
4,Good except it could block a power socket.,"I bought the 6 socket version of this but then I added two more monitors to my PC's so needed 8 sockets. So I bought this 12 outlet version instead so I have some sockets for unexpected electronics I might need. The only downside to the adapter is the power outlet plug. It is designed to not stick out from the wall too far, in doing so it has to be on the bottom of a 2 socket outlet as putting it in the top socket blocks off the bottom one with the angle of the cord.For me it meant I had to move theLinksys Powerline AV 4-Port Network Adapter Kit (PLSK400), invert it and plug it in upside down in the top socket so I could get everything in.Seems odd to use this method on the 12 socket version but not the 6 socket version."
5,belkin surge protector.,This works awesome and keeps the flawless operaton of the computer and attachments free of spikes and burnouts from surge.
4,Great Product,"Great bang for your buck. 12 outlets are pleanty for my entertainment system which includes and xbox, wii, DVD player, HD TV, internet modem and digital cable box. The only negative thing I can say is the power switch is on the side, rather than the top. I have accidentally bumped in to it more than once and turned the power off."
4,Belkin 12 Outlet Surge Protector,I needed a surge protector with at least an 8 foot power cord and space for at least 5 power blocks. This meets my requirement.
4,Lots of outlets!,"I put this behind my entertainment center because I needed way more than 2 outlets. Very pleased with the product. I have more than enough outlets now and what is nice about this product is that you can close the outlets that you're currently not using, so you don't have to worry about anything falling into them."
4,great tape!,"I like all the routines,but especially like Michael Carsons the best. I like alot of standing core work which he focuses on,and it just makes the stretching of your side ab muscles feel good and flexible. And your also getting a good cardio workout at the same time in a small amount of time."
4,"The good, the bad and the ugly.","The good is I purchased 4 boxes of Milwaukee 16 gauge nails of different sizes. The prices were attractive and the shipping was fee. No better deal out there. Now I know that I have the ability to deal with most nailing issues as they come up.The bad is that Amazon shipped them to me in a shipping box too large for the four nail boxes and with only a limited amount of packing material. The heavy boxes of nails bounced around within the packing box.The ugly. When I opened the shipping box. Three of the four nail boxes had split open. Nails were mixed between each other and my great deal now became a choice of going online to figure out the return process, reboxing, going to the post office and returning the items or separtating the nails. As most nails remained in thier long attached format. I separated them. Probably about the same amount of time as returning it.Would I order again. Absolutely, but not more than one or two boxes at a time."
4,Fun for a while...Overall good game,"I thought this game was graphically impressive, but no more so than any of the other current role playing games. (It slows down running on my high-end gaming machine at some points in the game running at 1280x1024. My video cards really heat up playing this game!)Gameplay is good, and as you progress through the game you build up your various health scores and experience levels, and are awarded new skill areas to master. Monsters are challenging for me, even on the easy setting, but maybe that is just me not having 5+ hours a day to sit and play it. Overall I would recommend it, but even more so if you are into Greek Mythology, since it has a lot has to do with that in the game. After a while the amount of monsters increases and becomes a bit overkill..I've not tried the multiplayer mode yet. For some reason it is not working with my router and I've little time to troubleshoot it."
4,Hustle,Hustle is the correct name for this movie. I learned so much from this movie.A movie all would enjoy.
1,Not for middle/secondary teachers,"This book assumes a lot of time is available to teach students civilized ways of treating others. It does not serve those of us who teach middle or high school--we generally have 45 minutes per day, are required to complete the text in one year, and have students whose attitudes and habits are almost solidified. This book has some great ideas which may work in elementary classrooms. If you teach adolescents, I recommend books by Lee Canter or Randall Sprick."
4,A good read,"Nicolas was just a bit too suffering....I had a hard time with his reasoning. It played up the best friend throughout the book and then left him hanging at the end.Despite all of that it was still a good read. The story kept me interested. I really liked the idea that Jane got to grow up before the relationship came together. 17 wasa bit too young for Nicolas. The story allowed Jane to mature, but remain somewhat inocent. I read most of Brenda Joyce's books....I love some, and always like the rest. This was a like.The tales she tells hold your interest throughout."
3,Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice,"I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend, but I found it to be disturbing and too much of the same thing."
1,limited functionality,"This game allows you to take about 20 songs from well known composers, but the songs themselves aren't terribly well known. Using these 20 or so songs, you can edit them (louder - softer) and (faster-slower), and then play it back. That's it. I thought this game would allow me to make my own musci by putting in the notes and then hearing it back. Oh well, I got it used for $7, so I guess I'n $7 in hole."
1,The Worst Piece of Trash I have ever read!!,Use it to start a campfire!! In my opinion the book was too slow and nothing got accomplished. The Thing i didn't understand was all the -Waste Not Want Not- Crap.
2,Did not live up to the first book.,After reading THE BROTHERS WAR I was could not wait to read this book. But it was not as well writen and did not have much to do with anything. When Urza goes to Serra's realm there was a lot of potential but little happened.
1,A lot of dead trees for nothing,"Well, Im dissapointed, The Brothers War was one of the best licenced books ive ever read. But Planeswalker is too phillosophical and slow."
2,Not great quality,"I was disappointed by this one. Some of the parts did not want to go together well, we had to resort to glue. It also comes apart easily. It would be fine to sit on the shelf but is not a great ""toy"" to play with. I'm all for planes that don't require glue or tools or paint, but this one seemed to be really cheap quality. However, my son didn't get upset, he still enjoys it. I just would have paid a few more bucks for a sturdier toy."
3,Meh,"It's a snap together model, so don't expect much. My son was able to put it together easily enough, but I did have to modify a wing piece that otherwise would not fit properly.He likes it, so I guess that's all that matters in the end."
3,"Good, until the end","ROTS was a very good puzzle game, for a mixture of easy and excruciatingly hard puzzles it does not disappoint... However, it drags on a little longer than a person can take, and many of the puzzles are dependant on inventory hunting (some of which is easy to find, and some that are not, like the sacred scroll, there is not clue for where it is, you just need dumb luck!) And the ending is incredibly anti-climactic for what the game built up... They could have made any ending better than a seven minute monologue! It leads into the next game yes, but I wanted a good ending for this game!!"
4,When Al was fusion guitar,"""Tour De Force Live"" is a mini-best of Al Dimeola. The Band is a once in a lifetime lineup. Gadd(Drums), Hammer(Keyboards),Jackson(Bass)and Mingo(Percussion) ensure that the perfection of the studio is kept in this live recording. One dissapointment is that, besides a litttle reggae in ""Race With the Devil"", there isn't any improvisation. Dimeola pretty much recreates his studio versions verbatim. I recommend that you get this disc as an introduction to Al's solo career(It was mine). This is an incredible live recording and if it wasn't for the crowd being heard at the end of tunes you would have no idea. Al delivers most of the goods in his playing and the compositions are original. Anyone that thinks that these are simplistic should try writing something like ""Race With the Devil"". The other dissapointment of this disc is no acoustic showcase. If you desire to hear all that Al is capable of then get ""Elegant Gypsy"". This disc is still a very good one."
5,Da Hottest,I think that this CD by B2K was the shot. I mean what else do ya'll expect from a talented and sexy group as themselves. I also have the JBoog autographed Pandemonium. And that was hizzot. So a few extra hot songs just made this thing blazin. C'mon ya'll. Support these fellas cause they doing something positive. Oh yeah and for ya'll that don't know Jarell Houston is all mine!One Luv` Mrs.JHouston
3,The ballads make it work,"Most R&B either excel at slow jams or up-tempo tracks. B2K falls into the former category and the slow jams are what make this CD work. A lot of love topics on this CD are covered regrets is covered in Sleepin and, sung with the great feeling. While accusations that the woman addressed is only interested in money in Would You Be Here. The other slow jam worth mentioning is the hidden track What You Get, which showcases Omarion's tenor. The only up-tempo track worth mentioning is the advance single Bump, Bump, Bump which was produced, written, and arranged by R. Kelly and which is co-billed to rapper P. Diddy. Sadly B2K never got the chance to mature into a credible R&B group, but what can you do !"
1,1-1/2 stars -- Just how greedy ARE these guys?,"Come on, isn't it enough that B2K released THREE albums last year? Apparently not, because three months into the new year they re-released Pandemonium with four new songs - and two of those songs are ""Girlfriend"" (which isn't exactly the best song I've ever heard). Plus, ""Why I Love You"" is STILL on here. And the album is, like, 79 minutes long now. Sheesh."
3,energized but bored sequel,"Good album although more of the same... Talentous group (mainly Omarion) doin the typical club hits make this CD something bored. The best: ""One Kiss"", ""Tease"", ""Why I Love You"" and the dancefloor breaker ""Bump bump bump""."
1,would prefer 0 stars,"My kids won't touch it since the first time they tried it. It is very difficult and my son is 7 and knows quite a bit of spanish from school, as does my 4 1/2 years old. Saving it for the next garage sale."
1,"Poorly executed, just a list of courses",The previous editions of this book were full of energy and conveyed the spirit and practice of what it was like to take college courses online. This edition is no more than a list of courses. What a disappointment!
1,New but not Newest,The Missal was not the newest version so was returned and I am still waiting for a credit to be applied to my account.
5,Sarah Winnemucca,"Read AFTER you read Sarah's book. Straightens out small, insignifficant ""errors"" made by Sarah. No fiction here.I recommend ""buy.""This book does NOT take the place of reading Sarah's book."
3,Not the best biography of Sarah Winnemucca,"Zanjani's writing is academic and somewhat dry. The historical research has not advanced much since Gae Whitney Canfield's ""Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes"" but Zanjani does incorporate new theoretical approaches to interpreting Sarah's own memoir and place in history. The bibliography then, is useful for scholars, but the the prose is further bogged down with unresolved (and unresolvable) intellectual issues best left to academics. Try Canfield's well researched and easily readable prose instead."
5,Textbook,"Seller Great to work with! Arrived on time and in great condition, definitely going to use amazon.com again for future textbook purchases."
4,Kingston Data Traveler Reader,"This little device serves as a 2 GB USB flash drive and reader for your SD card. You can transfer photos from your SD card right to your computer without the hassle of plugging in your camera. You can also read/write files, photos to the SD card directly from your computer which makes this perfect to transfer files to your SMARTPHONE. The only drawback is the little plastic cover, which seems easily breakable."
2,Where is the memory?,"This item is just the reader and the adapter, NO MEMORY.When they say 2GB I guess that's the limit of the reader?Who knows? Still a nice design and all, just add memory and go.I love Kingston, really I do!"
4,Light erotic,good for a quick read and lightly erotic. love the paranormal aspect of it. Fantasy is such a great thing.
3,Kind of disapponting...,"This CD was bought as a Christmas present for a friend, who loves Heino as much I do.Yet he was very disappointed regarding the song selections. Most of them were medleys that are almost on every other Heino CD. I myself have the full versions of these songs and enjoy them very much. Guess I should checked it out better. Too many repeats, no matter how much we love our favorite singers, just gets tiring. I'll be more careful the next time."
4,LOVELY,Deals with EVERYONE'S deepest issue (not just children): FEAR. We are so accustomed to hearing this story that we've lost sight of all it has to tell us about ourselves...right NOW!
5,Perfect Fix,"I had an issue of difficult to flush complaint. A 7 year old Mansfield No. 110. Originally ordered the whole flush valve assembly (211-112-P) and saw this Flush Valve on the assembly. Install this valve by shutting off the water, unscrewing refill tube cap and slide up the float assembly and pull off old Valve. Install this seal in the top ring grove. Reverse to install. Awesome and easy repair."
4,Crazy Forklift,"My son loves this forklift & so do his friends. My initial concern was that it was not going to last. Well, in about a month we have had to crazy glue it twice! The plastic used is not very thick and cannot stand up to pressure applied to the forks. So we bought the Tonka as well. It is very sturdy."
2,Broke within 3 weeks,"I bought this forklift because it was a good size for little hands and the forklift bucket was big enough to actually put cargo in. And although this product is realistic, it is shabbily made of easily-breakable plastic. The steering wheel, front console and forklift forks all broke within 3 weeks. Do not waste your money."
5,Love It - Highly Recommend It!,"This CD nourishes the deepest regions of my soul. It coaxes my inner magical child to the surface. Many of the songs make me feel like the Great Mother is speaking directly to me. As far as what the other reviewer ""jenne"" said, I don't think this CD is music just for the sake of music. This CD heals the soul and I highly recommend it.-Bright Blessings! - Thea"
3,thought it would help but...meh.,"The product is good, materials are what I would expect for this price range and size, but I have found that having the mirror isn't much help. It's pretty small and with a bike your always turning and moving so the angle never seems to be right. It's a great product if you're able to install it ""just so"" and are okay with fiddling with it about every 10 seconds."
3,Cement Mixer,My six-year-old son received this truck as a birthday gift and he loves it. He loves that the mixer really works. He loves the size. He wants to take it with him every time we leave the house.
1,"Does anyone know if Bruder contains PVC, BPA or phthalates?? They won't tell...","It seems pretty shady that the Bruder website has no email addresses for consumers to ask product safety questions. The Bruder website only specifies their toys are made 95% in Germany, in compliance with EN-71 and ATSM codes. Codes that in NO WAY exclude PVC, BPA or phthalates in toys. So I scanned parent safety websites, green toy blogs and COULD FIND NO ENDORSEMENT of Bruder either. Hmmmm. There was also no testing available of Bruder toys to show content. Hmmm....Might be wise to yank those Bruder toy boats out of the tub during bath time until somebody can confirm this item and others are safe."
2,Disappointed,"My overall disappointment is the lack of movability -- the cement cylinder cannot be lifted away from the truck bed. The wheels go forward & backward but do not turn & limits ""driving"" to pushing. Because the wheels do not turn, the truck falls over very easily when pulled. The front side mirrors are black plastic only-no silver paint or metal. The cab does open to reveal the engine; however, the engine is completely black plastic with very little model detail & no painted parts. Also, the engine is not removable for play or examination.This truck seems more like a plastic model than a toy for a child. My grandson talks about his ""cement truck"" but plays very little with it. A more detailed description would have been helpful. The toy does not offer enough play/educational options to be worth the price."
1,"oh cripes, not another one...","Yikes! It's a collection of what I'd consider mishaps at my bench! Oh, lord...I'm sorry, apparently it's called ""art"" by folks with probably more money than taste. Page after page of weird art project jewelry, most of it unwearable on purpose, to be ""exhibited"" and looked at, rather than worn.The highlight of the book was a dead mouse wearing a crown of pearls, suspended in a block of clear acrylic.When that's the highlight...? *scratching my head*I hate to sound so narrow-minded, but I keep running into this with a lot of the jewelry books I've been buying. I guess maybe I'm just craving a book with pictures of some things people might wanna.. you know.. actually wear? I was pretty sure that's what jewelry was supposed to be, for the most part. I guess despite everyone thinking I'm a weirdo all my life--and me being proud of it--maybe I'm actually old-fashioned and boring after all. :-o"
2,Say it in Portuguese Brazilian edition,"I am not quite sure how often Dover Say it ... series are updated, but obviously they aren't. Since this book is old fashion and does show its age between vocabulary, lack of technical and modern terms, and a pronunciation guide that makes it sound Spanish or Italian. I recommend the Lonely Planet Brazilian Portuguese book. At least it more slangy and more current. It is a lot more informative too."
2,worthless,this book is about the size of a deck of cards but not as thick. I looked at it for about 2 seconds and have not used it since.
2,Doesn't work very well on wine,"Bought this after successfully using an earlier version of this product for wine stains, but apparently they've changed the formula (the label and name on the bottles I received do not look like the picture on the internet and are different from what I purchased earlier, though it still says Out Spot in small letters on the label and was sold as such online when I bought it). But this time it did NOT work to satisfaction on fresh wine stains. Used it immediately after spilling the wine while they were still wet, soaked the items overnight as recommended on the label, but it still left a very visible purplish-grey stain on cotton. The earlier version of the product used to work like magic."
4,Good Joint Supplement,approved by my vet as having multiple quality ingredients MSM/Glucosamine/Condrioitin for canine joint support - pets love the taste also.
1,Rip-off,This is not funny. It's just dumb. The musical quality is very poor. It is so sophomoric that I doubt that my 11-year-old grandson will even find it funny. The only good thing is that it is *very* short -- there is less than 15 minutes worth of music on this CD.
1,Not what I ordered,This is not what I thought I ordered. I thought I was ordering her Greatest Hits with only 10 songs on it NOT her 17 Greatest Hits.
3,I wanted to give it 4...but couldn't,"There were so many ridiculous moments in this episode...including many of which break rules about the EMH that were used as plot devices and excuses earlier in the series. If you can see past those you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this episode.As a lead in to the season finale it just fails for me...at this point in TNG or DS9 the show was EPIC! I mean edge of my seat intergalactic space battles spanning multiple races and sectors, story-lines were approaching their climax....I couldn't wait to see the finales. Here on Voyager it's just this strange stand-alone episode with a conclusion that made no sense; the Doc didn't even get punished for betraying his crew AGAIN? At least take away his Emergency Command Hologram crap so he can't almost kills you all again...Jesus Christ....I've really enjoyed all of season 7, I just hope this episode isn't indicative of the finale."
3,Defective Product,"The radio portion was inoperative straight out of the packaging. Made this ""discovery"" after ordering a second unit but one couldn't send or receive messages. Figured out which was the defective unit by using a third two-way radio. Wrote to Garmin who suggested that I send in both units. Thanks to Amazon who was very accomodating with an excahnge. Wonder what hoops Garmin would have put me through. Maybe the product is ""normally"" ok but I ended up with a lemon."
3,"Fun Toy, Awkward Tool","These radios cram a lot of great features in a package that almost fits in a pocket. And the price isn't bad for the combination of a decent radio and an adequate GPS, especially when you can do neat things like broadcast your position to other Rinos so that it appears on their GPS map display. But all these great features only really work if you are paying close of attention. There are simply too many features to use conveniently as part of any real outdoor activity. A superb, well thought out user interface might solve the problem, but that's not what you get with this product -- not by a long shot. Garmin has done a decent workmanlike job with its menus and buttons, but it simply isn't nearly enough to save these from being much more than toys.Two further points worth noting. The longer range GMRS radio does not broadcast location information, and in order to use GMRS you must apply for a license with the FCC, involves a fee and several very confusing forms."
5,Best buy for the money,I wasn't sure that I was going to like the ankle boot look so I bought these in black because they were inexpensive. The sizes are right on and the boots fits perfectly. For right around 20-30 bucks this is the best buy. If you are on your feet all day they start to hurt by the end but nothing that inserts can't fix!
4,"Great Product, works fast and easy","I got it overseas 5 months ago. It works great, just turn it on and you can use it after 15 to 20 minutes with great steam. Easy to use, to fold and to keep. I use it at least twice a week, zipper areas started ripping a little after 5 months of use."
3,"Battery was defective, but full refund issued within a few weeks.","The battery was not working properly once inside the laptop. I asked for support by e-mail, they instructed me to mail it back for a refund. I did so, and the refund was cretited to my card a few days later."
1,Sony VAIO Replacement Battery,Sony has tried to protect their replacement battery business. Sony has software and firmware that prevents the use of other manufacturers batteries. The replacement battery I purchased here still does not work in our Sony computer.
2,45 Minutes Tops !,"This battery is a joke, You would expect this size of battery to last at least for the duration of a full length movie... Swing and a miss..."
2,Disappointed,I bought this book thinking I was getting a Bible study/commentary on Romans. Very disappointing when I saw the book was mainly a work journal. You may like if this is your objective but if you want a detailed and wonderful commentary read the book on Romans by Chuck Swindle.
4,great information,I purchased this to get ready for the 2005 conversions. I was especially concerned regarding the numerous DTS packages that will have to be converted. This book is a goldmine of information. So glad to have found it.
3,"Love, come to me","I liked this book, but not as much as i like Lisa Kleypas' other books. I can understand why she said in an interview that her earlier books aren't that good.I thought that some parts were boring and i skimmed through them, but i did enjoy the love story between the two characters."
2,i was tricked!,"I was so excited as I waited for the release of a new Lisa Kleypas book. Now I know it was simply a re-release. The book was disappointing to say the least. There was no action and no real conflict. We simply followed the H/H through their marriage. The heroine was spoiled, annoying, and immature. We rarely got to see what was going on in the hero's head, so I never knew what drove him; why he did the things he did. Neither the heroine nor the reader knew much about his past and what we did learn we got through snooping through his things and from secondary characters. I agree with other reviewers that all the historical facts bogged the story down and mostly just skipped over those parts. If you dont need action, adventure, mystery, or plot twists in your story then this is the book for you. I, on the other hand, found this book fairly boring. It only got 2 stars because I like Kleypas' more recent work."
2,Not up to Lisa's normal standard,I usually enjoy Lisa Kleypas' books very much but I've been reading this one is spurts and just can't get it done. Not sure I'll finish it. She hasn't managed to make me care about the characters enough to wade through all of the conflict and history. I would not recommend this book.
2,well it's a radio,"this device is as clunky as a hammer made of jello, and feels about as ergonomic.not sure what Garmin was smoking when they made this but let's see monochrome with bad lighting controls, awful menu, tiny useless buttons, serial cable connect to pc.... yeah the totally obsolete no reason to use serial""the port no computer has had for a long time"", battery compartment is well stupid but unlike the other features.so let's summarize junk and obsolete junk this thing pisses me off and costs a couple hundred dollars.just buy a real gps they cost less and work, and one can only hope garmin and the other mfrs have come out of the stone age and use usb."
2,rino is junk,im very disappointed in my rino 120.its plagued without problems.the microphone is not sensitive enough no matter how loud you talk into mic people can not here you on other 2 way radios.the input jack for headset is faulty you have to wiggle headphone plug around to get headphones and mic to work.basemap that is included with rino is vagued so plan on spending at least another [money]100 for mapsource cd.rino uses a click and stick button to switch modes and change setting the botton is small and difficult to use.lcd screen is so small you need a pair of binoculars to read it.i contacted garmin and they said tey were aware of the problems and were working on solutions.they would contact me when they come up with something.that was a month ago.
4,Not too bad but has some issues.,This unit works fairly well. I can tell you that the radio feature of it does not seem to work as well as a regular FRS radio. I was in a situation where I was standing right next to someone with a regular radio and they were picking people up that I could not hear. My communication abilities were not as good as the rest of our group. They were trying to talk to me several times and I never heard them. I am not sure if this radio just doesn't have the transmit strength of a regular FRS radio. I am also not sure if it possibly has a higher squelch threshold which would cause it to not hear as well as other radios.Overall it is not a bad product. I will be interested to see version 2 of it. It think they will fix some of the minor issues that it has.
3,Okay,"This is branded as either Eveready or Energizer. It's body is sturdy, but not as well-built as comparable Streamlight or Coast Cutlery products. AAA batteries are common--which is good since you'll probably need to change them relatively frequently (incandescent bulb). Push button activation is convenient--it feels just like a push button pen. Pretty good light output.It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. For a little extra money you can get an LED-based light that will last much longer (both bulb and batteries) and will probably be more sturdy. The only reason I can think of for getting this is if you don't like the light output from the LED's (I think incandescents have a reassuring warmth to them, while LED's seem a bit sterile). Otherwise, I would recommend looking at the LED's from Streamlight or Coast Cutlery (in particular, the Streamlight 65018 Stylus is pretty impressive)."
3,Didn't affect cat much,We tried using the pills but my cats still cried because they were scared. Either the pills didn't work mch or my cats need sedatives to chill out.
2,Buggy,"Nice program when it works but it is very buggy. As other reviewers have noted, it often locks and crashes. I have gotten in the habit of saving after every action to minimize the losss. Some messages are unintelligible, written by someone with a couple of months of English. There's no excuse to market a product like this. And, as others noted, Ulead's tech support simply ignores queries for help. I've put in two requests and not gotten a response to either."
1,Audio Synch Problems,"This is a nicely designed product BUT... I'm importing long analog video clips from old tapes. My captures seem to play fine, but as soon as I either edit the footage, or burn the raw footage to DVD, the audio goes horribly out of synch. Users on a Ulead web board identify this as a known problem and give an elaborate work-around, which doesn't work for me. This is a buggy product and I don't recommend it. Next I'll be trying one of the Adobe products."
2,Crash on me three times,"I ordered it, then Download the trial version on Ulead website. Atfer it crashed three times I decided to return the product. Other then that it was easy and straight forward to use."
2,Lame,"Two intertwined plots, the development of the simulacra and Rosen's growing obsession with Pris - and he simply abandoned the interesting one. Even with the first-person perspective, he never managed to bring Louis and his feelings for Pris to life. The simulacra story could have been very good - early on I was conviced we were going to see Stanton rise to political power in the modern age, but he disappeared even before the rest of the simulacra plot. But the last chapters were a huge letdown."
3,little helper,My son got this 2 years ago for Christmas. It is nice and compact and and a great price. The only problem is the oven and dishwasher doors don't close most of the time. The kids open them and then stand on them and now they just flop open most of the time. My kids are generally very easy on their toys and have never broken or worn out anything. I would suggest looking for another set that is more durable.
3,"Nice &amp; Sturdy, but Small","This item is made out of sturdy, thick plastic. No assembly required (the stickers are even already on). It has all the appliances you could want in a kitchen--fridge, dishwasher, oven, microwave, and even a phone--with plenty of storage space for dishes and play food. However, it does not come with any accessories. Also, the sink handle does not move (so baby can't pretend to turn it off or on), and sink does not have a removable basin. The electronic phone (with sounds) is a nice feature, and was a major selling point in my decision to purchase this item. Please be aware that this item is for SMALL children. My daughter is not even 2 (and average height) and it is just right for her now, so she will probably outgrow it in a year or two. The height is actually just over 30 inches (this site shows it as over 36 inches, but I think the height and width must be reversed). Overall, a solid product, but I was disappointed in the size."
1,"Not the toy's fault, customer's don't read!","Those of you who complain the toy was too small, why didn't you do your homework and simply check that out before ordering it. Dimensions are always listed. I just don't think you should bash the toy if you are the one who didn't read before you purchased! I personally went with the lifestyle dream kitchen for this very reason but at least I took the time to research the toy first."
4,Great for toddlers,"We absolutely love this item, and especially the whole Step2 product line. It is very durable and with little ones beating on it constantly, slamming the doors, climbing on it, etc, it is holding up well. The only negative I can share is that it came with the decals on it (the pictures that show the microwave, oven, window scene, stove knobs) were placed on it before shipping and they dont seem to want to stay totally stuck flat on the unit. I highly recommend this or any other Step2 product, they make good stuff for little ones."
3,Nice!,"I liked this book, ordered it for a 1 year old and he liked to feel the furry and fuzzy touch parts in the book. The only thing, I wish the little books were a bit longer, more to them, they are just a few pages for the price."
2,Damn!,"I had such high hopes for this movie resulting from the many excellent reviews and many festival entries. I REALLY tried to like it, BUT it seemed to me that the two main characters had no chemistry at all and most of the time they were intermittently infuriating and obnoxious. As someone mentioned in another review they circled one another in a dance with one chair left and neither of them wanting to take the first move. Production values were excellent. I feel both the lead characters were woefully miscast in what could have been a rather sweet AND realistic story of self discovery and romance. By the way, if anyone knows of a town this tolerant, please send me a travel guide."
3,Don't start packing just yet...,"Cute idea, decent acting, but the storyline is pretty far out there. I'd definitely recommend it as a rental, but that's about where it would stop."
3,"Was okay, but I thought fairly slow moving","While a slow moving film, I was happy for once to see a gay flick that wasn't about penises, how to hook up or of a ""sexual"" nature other than running through some issues. I did think the actors in the movie were a bit stiff, and the story was a bit hard to believe."
5,If we could only have more Big Edens,"A treasure of a movie that all should see.Movie focuses on a New York artist who must move back to Big Eden, Montana to care for his ailing grandfather. He has never been able to tell his grandfather that he is gay (grandfather raised him) and found that life in Big Eden would not fit in with his lifestyle.What Henry finds is a open and inviting community that will bring either positive or negative reactions from viewers. Those that will find it positive are those that grew up in an area like Big Eden and those who find it negative will only find it that way because they have longed for a community like Big Eden.The movie, although very dramatic, does have its comedic elements.Watch this movie with parents or loved ones. This is the movie that will bridge families closer together.I cannot say enough about this movie.The DVD is chalk full of extras that make it a must for anyone's gay movie collection."
4,big eden,"I liked this video and it appears that everyone has that someone in the past that we wonder ""what would it have been like to hook up with them."" Interesting character developement."
1,BIG Disappointment,"I bought this movie based on the reviews here. What a disappointment. I thought I was watching a different movie than the one reviewed here. The premise of the movie was encouraging, but the execution and the acting was just not believable. In fact at times it was laughable (unintentionally). The lead was not believable - I couldn't get past the premise that he was being persued by TWO men, not just because he wasn't traditionally 'cute', but there was NOTHING in his personality that made him attractive or appealing. In fact, he seemed to be uncomfortable being gay. Another problem I had was that the movie was filled with all these 'wacky' but lovable and understanding characters who became annoying (to me) since they were a bit too cutesy. This movie tries to be a 'feel good' movie, but I couldn't get past the bad acting and unbelievable characters. The movie's soundtrack was the best thing (older Country)."
2,description misleading,description failed to state category of movie. description failed to state category of movie. description failed to state category of movie.
2,Ditto,"See ""A Viewer from Midwest US's"" review. I don't think the director was going for ""surreal"" here, but that what the movie felt like. Not a single homophobe in the entire town. And the bit about the guy struggling to come to terms with his heterosexuality was ridiculous. And ""Big Eden"" was SLOW. My boyfriend claimed they ""packed a one hour movie into two hours""."
2,Sooo boring!,"can the plot go any slower? and in the end you're given NOTHING. don't buy it, rent it only if you have a cupon for a free rental. because it's not worth the 4 bucks. sorry"
4,In a perfect world,"This is what any love story should be about, the people. Thisstory would have worked whether or not the main charactors were gay. I love the fact that this love story was just that, a love story. It was about people taking chances, being true to oneself, trust, letting go of the past, doing what you love and following your heart. This was funny, a little utopian, sad, and poignant."
4,so far so good.,Our dog is not throwing up as much two days into taking product. Looks like it is really helping her & she can now not barf after each meal after a couple rounds of antibiotics.
3,Average buy,I bought this book as a required text for my med school immunology block. My firs time using the book. I like the images and captions. I also like the fact that key terms are not only defined at the back of the book but a quick summary of how these terms apply within the text is given. What I dislike about the book is the fact that topics are not well organized; they're scattered all over the book. I only used it for reference and for the cartoons/images.
4,the gourdmother,"As far as cozies go, this book is probably one of the better ones. I just don't think the book was for me. I didn't really take to the gourds, and I found it to be a peculiar theme for a cozy. I actually thought the mystery got a little lost in the book, and the end was predictable. As usual, the heroine comes face to face with the killer, and she has to find a way out or something of the sort. That theme is just too played out in this genre.I will say that I appreciated the mentions of 9/11 and the very real depiction of grief from Nora. I found her friends' reaction to be quite refreshing, as they were authentic. Again, the book was pretty good, but it just wasn't my style."
2,Similar to Trader Joe's?,"Trader Joe's carried an identical product over the holidays and sold it for just $9.95. The $49.95 price is quite excessive for just 1 pound of chocolate. I was terribly disappointed with the TJ product because most of the flavors left a horrible finish (after taste) in my mouth. You should not have to pay an incredible $50 for a pound of chocolate, even if each package is single-origin. Buy some 100g bars of Valrhona at $3-5 each as the experience is much better."
4,Beginner's Headache,"The wide angle lens is great for taking closeups and fitting everything in the shot. The auto mode is good for outdoor shots, not so good for indoor. I am learning how to control the camera manually for taking indoor shots with low lighting situations. There are too many setup choices on this camera for the beginner. The 8400 definitely has a learning curve to the controls. It would have been a big plus to include a custom case with this camera. I hope to master the controls and user setups on the Coolpix, I feel it has a lot of potential."
1,YUCK!,"The only good things about this not so good sounding collection is that it is family friendly. The twins, adorable as ever, have done a huge service in helping girls feel good about themselves. That is on the plus side.On the down side, the songs on this collection stink. The surfing cliche is really old and sounds silly. The girls have outgrown the age and stage where California slang sounds cute. It is one thing when a toddler repeats these quips, but it ain't so cute when big kids do it. The songs aren't even sung well. Even though the collection did not appeal to this reviewer, it did serve some good purposes. It is family friendly and girl friendly."
4,Our twins toddlers each have one...,"And they LOVE them! It is great how the front compartment opens so they can put people inside. The back ""bin"" is not attached and that is REALLY frustrating to them! So, we taped it on, but it still falls off all the time.And be aware! This truck fits a LOT of ""garbage"" so every little toy your child owns will end up in it sooner or later!"
3,Lynne Miranda,"My son loves to play with his Garbage truck, But it is NOT WORTH the MONEY!!!!!. For the amount you paid for it, it should have been electronic."
1,shipping,"I ordered this item on December 11, 2004, and it has not yet been delivered (January 14, 2005). Never have a gotten a more circular runaround from a company as I have from Amazon. The people I have talked to have lied to me (""Believe me, this is going to be shipped out by the end of the week""), have told me they have solved the problem (""just needed to be billed to your credit card company""), told me it was the distribution center's fault but there was no way I could get in touch with the distribution center."
5,A Ton of Fun!,"When my granddaughter,Allison, saw this she had to have it. She already had 2 of the original Miracle Babies at that time (she now has the one that drinks and wets).So I bought it for her and she has had such a good time playing with it and pretending. The toy is very educational and sturdy too. When closed there is a ""car seat"" for the tiny Miracle Baby to set in, which makes it easy to transport. Too cute!!"
4,Super Babies: Baby Geniuses 2,"This was a cute little movie. I bought it because my daughter just had a baby and I was buying the first one. I was surprised at how much I truly enjoyed this movie. I do like the orginal better it is hard to duplicate the orginal in any movie, but this movie held it's own. If you have children or if you are just a kid at heart then grab the popcorn, the candy and cup of soda sit back and enjoy this cute little movie. P.S. You can't beat the price either!"
3,It's fine. Nothing special...just fine.,"It's smaller than I was expecting. It does have lots of pockets and compartments, but it turns out it's kind of annoying to have to open a thousand doors to get to what you want. Don't get me wrong, the product is of fine quality and is as advertised. I guess I would say it's more of an ""over-engineered"" solution. I've got a Carter's diaper bag I carry around every day...one big opening in the middle, a couple of pockets on the sides, one waterproof compartment to keep dirty clothes, etc. Exactly what I need, easy to access everything. I think I got caught up in the ""new mom"" thing when I was still pregnant of trying to find THE perfect, innovative, new, interesting, unusual baby item. You don't really need a lot of bells and whistles. Keep it simple and you'll save yourself a lot of time and money."
5,A wonderful book,"Johnny Payne's book is a wonderful creative writing tool for both teaching and learning on your own, complete with indepth analysis--all presented in a very accessible style. (Although I could have done without the personal stories about the wife, etc.) Use this book and follow the exercises, and your writing will improve."
4,black dragon,Black Dragon T-Shirt is a high quality shirt. The graphics are sharp and clear. The fit is true to size. I would recommend it to a friend.
3,Very poor,"Jane Eyre is my favorite book; I've read it three times. The only reason I gave this movie three stars is because the movie followed the book very well.Clarke was a fair Jane, though I don't think she captured her passion at all. She was entirely too calm when Jane should have been a lot more passionate. And there were moments in the movie when she seemed very pretty and as much as we would like Jane Eyre to be pretty, she is not in the least.Dalton was a very poor Rochester. He acted the part very badly and he and Clarke clearly had no chemistry. I also think that he played the part a little too angrily, though that could have just been bad acting."
1,Save your money and your time,"This miniseries is miserably amateurish. I've seen better actors at school plays. Who wrote these favorable reviews? Their parents? Bad, bad, bad."
1,Defective merchandise,I bought Jane Eyre at the Amazon Marketplace from importcds. The item was defective. I emailed importcds and got no response. I had to go through Amazon to ask for a refund and Amazon gave me one. I bought the product a second time and this time from Amazon. I love this show and I hope the second go around is not defective. Amazon did the right thing issuing me a refund. I will continue to order from Amazon since they offered good customer service.
2,Jane Eyre,I was very disappointed in this version. I think the acting is so terrible that I never finished the movie. It was boring I prefer the Masterpiece Theatre version.
1,STIFF,"Oh my gosh! There is no emotion. I just can't believe Timothy Dalton's stiff unemotional version of a wonderful classic. Brits can be very reserved in public, but in private they can be truly loving and...emotional. This version is cold! I wasted by money."
3,"Great material, atrocious video quality","Apparently, there are several versions of this production of Jane Eyre available: the original five-and-a-half-hour version, a five-hour (?) version, and a four-hour version. I bought my copy last year, and it's the full version. The problem is the video quality: Almost six hours of material is crammed onto one double-sided DVD! As a result, the picture has the quality of streaming video: choppy with poor resolution. So, my three-star rating reflects how cheaply this DVD is produced. The program, however, is probably the definitive production of Jane Eyre."
5,FANTASTIC!,I can't stop watching this movie!! I am amazed at the accuracy of the Character development and script writing to be so paralled to the book. Why haven't we seen more of Zelah Clarke? Amazing!! Brilliant!! Timothy Dalton a true performance of Rochester. His best work!
4,Awesome.,"Honestly, no adaptation will ever match the beauty of the novel itself. With that being said, I think that this adaptation is wonderful. Although Jane Eyre is the main character here, Timothy Dalton certainly steals the show as Mr. Rochester. He acts beautifully, and I'll forgive him that he is TOO handsome as a Mr. Rochester :) I do think, though, that the Jane Eyre in this series is portrayed a bit differently than the one in the novel. I think the novel portrays her as being a little spunkier and with a tad more sex appeal. I fear she is almost too quiet in the series, but alas, there are lots of high notes/scenes which outweigh that thought. Oh, Timothy Dalton certainly plays Rochester to a tee, and... would send any woman's heart racing! Check out Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Heathcliff in the 1970's adaptation of 'Wuthering Heights' too! Two completely different characters, but WORTH the viewing, and would make any woman wish to be Catherine as much as Jane."
2,"Timothy Dalton was great, but...","Great acting by Timothy Dalton, but he's too gorgeous for Mr. Rochester. I can't believe no other women wanted him except for his money. I thought Mr. Rochester and Jane in this version are mismatched. This Jane just looked like a self-righteous older woman with weak voice...not likable at all. She often looked annoyed or irritated, instead of having inner strength. I couldn't see how Mr. Rochester can be attracted to her. After reading the book, I felt like I couldn't have enough of Jane and Mr. Rochester, but this adaptation gave me some bad after taste."
4,Dalton is a very good Rochester,"If you can get past the soap opera feel of the music, the lighting and the introduction in every episode you get to see a very good likeness of Rochester played by Timothy Dalton. I have read some of the reviews lamenting the choice of Jane in this rendition, but I have to say I enjoyed it. She is as I would have imagined from the book. The newest 2011 is entirely too dark for me. They try to make it sexually tense and it fails. We are so caught up in fast-paced food, tv, life, movies. I like that this rendition is timed for what life was like when it was written-slowed and savored."
5,Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark,"I loved the movie and watch it often. TimothyDalton is incredible in the role of Mr. Rochester, and Zelah Clark is very good as Jane. However, the constant interuptions with chapter info is very annoying."
5,Perfect,"I can't improve on anyone else's review by saying anything different than the rest have--just that this is the most perfect adaptation imaginable. That it was a BBC production, instead of a cinema production, means nothing has to be left out or altered, as so many directors like to do. (Of course, its being a BBC production also means you have to turn the sound up to what would normally be a deafening level, but that's what you get.)Before seeing the film I was a bit disappointed to think Timothy Dalton played Rochester, but I was quite wrong: He IS Rochester, getting him exactly, passionately right. As for Zelah Clarke, I do agree that a sense of suppressed passion is lacking in her performance, but not so much that the viewer feels cheated; on the whole she is a great Jane, and I enjoyed her playfulness in the ending scenes, in which she teases Rochester over her cousin's interest in her.There is no possibility of your disappointment in this version; it's the only one you need to buy."
2,The problem was with the book NOT the seller.,"I was very disappointed in the book, I was hoping for something that I could do on a one on one basis with my child/children not for a classroom setting. This book is really more for groups of 5 or more."
4,"""Spinner"" Replacement","This fan provides a 13"" pitch blade. It is much better than the ""spinner"" we replaced. It did not require additional balancing. The installation is straight forward and not complicated. It is well balanced and runs quietly. The air movement is well above average for a 52"" blade. In our 10 x 11 room it is adaquate at medium speed. Price at big box stores is much higher than Amazon retailers. Home Depot would sell this item for about $160. online only. This is a good value for the price."
5,Bobs Best,"I have seen the british version of this (its been out over a year) We have a 2 year old boy who just loves Bob Scoop muck and dissy, glad to see this has finally made it to the US. For british parents in the US be warned its all been dubbed to american accents so its not the same old Bob we know and love If you have a 2 year old buy it its the best"
2,Not sure I like it,"My son, age 3, really likes the theme song but when it comes to watching it all the way through he has a hard time.I don't like Lofty whining all the time, actually, it gets quite annoying. The show overall is good for young kids but parents may not want to stay around to see if it goes anywhere.I was surprised to see the scarecrow being so mean to everyone. Didn't like them showing the kids to be bullies.There are better Bob the Builder videos than this one."
2,Plays on fears,This video highlights fears that my toddler never had before watching it. I would not buy this video again. Each machine is afraid of the dark or heights or storms and induces anxiety in small children.
1,Big hope didn't come through,"I had big hopes for these drill bits to work but when I tried them on broken off seized oxygen sensor instead of the drill bits drilling through it the oxygen sensor body, the body ate the drill bit and formed it to its inside diameter. The return back of the set was flawless though."
3,A Humorous Look at Some Bad Ideas.,"""What Were They Thinking?"" by Bruce Felton is a humorous look at bad ideas throughout history. Given the subject, it is easy to see that this is not a complete collection, and one could easily imagine that it will develop into a series of books. The book has several sections and covers many areas such as: politics, the arts, popular culture, war and peace, science, sports, business, etc... Mixed in with the stories of people trying to implement bad ideas are lists of bad ideas such as cars, books, movies, etc, and ill-advised quotes. Some of the ""bad ideas"" are fairly well known, some are actually urban legends, and others are much more obscure.This is not a great book, but it is fun, and it certainly does not demand to be read in one sitting. Rather it seems well suited to picking it up occasionally and reading the selections that catch one's eye. This book is an above average selection, and worthwhile for those looking for some light reading."
4,Great Crayons.,"I love these crayons. The hexagon shape means they won't roll of the table. They are thicker and longer than traditional crayons; less prone to breaking. The texture is somewhat soft which results in rich color. They show up well with colored construction paper.Unusual assortment of colors. For example, there are two shades of pink (but no true red), lt. green and teal, peach, yellow, a few shades of blue, a med. & dk. purple, white; no black or brown. I would have preferred a larger assortment of colors with some of the traditional colors included.One other note if you have dogs in the house: my dogs evidently love these crayons as much as I do. If they are left in their reach they devour them like they are a special treat. They leave other crayons alone."
4,History of Rock,This is a classic time piece of the Boston Rock scene. It's got some amazing blasts from the past.
3,"Where's the rest, Verve?","So, where is the complete version of this concert? In verve's vault, waiting another 5- 10 years, so they can sell it to you again. They missed a big chance od finnaly releasing this historic concert the way it should be, in a 2 cd edition, 24 bit remastered. Check out the Duke ay Newport release and compare it with this. The music itself is 4 stars at least, Lester was not in his prime anymore, and you can hear it, but Joe Williams is just amazing."
2,Buy Another Headphone !,Very complicated to install A2DP profile on PDAs.And it is too big.Buy another one !
3,not bad for the buck,It works well with my phone... no doubt about it! It is sort of difficult with my computer but I am able to make it work usually. Best for stereo music and phone calls though.
5,Amazing!,"The Boutenko family has taken a life threatening challenge and turned it into something amazing, special and a gift for the rest of us. A great read with inspiration and validation for a healthy lifestyle."
2,Remarkably easy compared to the real test. . .,"I am the director of a tutoring program in Boston. Kaplan SATs can be so much easier than the real thing that I sometimes to use them to help my eighth graders prepare for high school entrance exams.Instead of this book, buy:1) the College Board book of real, previously administered exams (the so-called Blue Book), then2) the more recent Princeton Review book of 11 Practice Exams.The old College Board book, 10 Real SATs, was also great, although it did not include the writing section and the reading section was different. Still, if you are struggling with the Math section or the long Reading passages, I would buy that book even before the Princeton book. And I would buy all of those books before this one."
1,Mistake on second question!,"I don't own this book; all I did was look at a random page on amazon. And wouldn't you know it - the second question I saw had a mistake that made it unsolvable. Specifically test 5, section 5, question 13, it read ""In constand ~demand as~ a pianist, David ~had never been~ ~more richer~ than ~he is~ now"". While the ""correct"" answer is ""more richer"", the verb ""is"" in the end doesn't agree with the ""had"" earlier in the sentence. Yet in the answer they make no mention of the second mistake.I remind you this is the second question I looked at. A little probability should tell you how lousy this book is."
5,A great purchase!!,"I saw the advertisements to this video in a magazine, bought the video and haven't looked back since. It is the best invesment in a video I have ever made. My son, two, LOVES this video. He is constantly asking for the ""tractor video"". He would be content to watch it a hundred times over. I can hardly wait to run out and purchase the rest of the videos in the series! If your kids are into tractors at all get this video!!"
1,Bad,"I was going to return these grips, but damaged them trying to install. They were VERY hard to manage and split as I tried to slip on. This is the first bad product review I have written for Amazon. Don't buy these one piece grips; get a two piece grip. I was careful to be sure they were supposed to fit my gun and I can't see how Hogue thought that? I am out the price as they split apart."
4,Hogue Monogrips,"The grip retention system for these Hogue Monogrips could be a little easier to use. My first try resulted in a stripped screw due to the necessity of starting the threads blindly and the screw retaning bracket being able to move out of position. Luckily, it's a standard size (Mine was a 10-32 machine screw - yours probably will be also), so I could replace it immediately. The next time around, I used a long screw to guide the grip on properly. Hogue could have mentioned this possibility, but chose instead to trust their customers' ingenuity."
3,Fun Game,"Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero).Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS.I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay."
5,JON BRANDT OVER TOM PETERSSON?,"Dude here who would call Tom Petersson a ""mediocre bassist"" is not a real Cheap Trick fan. Jon Brandt was a fine fill in, but the real essence of what makes Cheap Trick great was the original four members, including one of the rock solid and most creative bassists of all time, Tom Petersson. Smoke that!"
3,I love Cheap Trick (well I did when they Jon B Brant in the band) but this brings back good and bad memories!,"Finally! This half Live / half studio EP has finally been issuedon (Import) CD - and digitally remaster for our earwax comfort!Bless Rick, Rob and Bun E. for this! But it's too short. I was glad to see T.J. Peterson, a mediocore Bassist go, but unfortunately it took his almost ruining the All Shook Up lp to do it. Then the record company forced Jon out and recycled Tom for the second or third time and they've been going downhill ever since [Woke up (dead) with a monster [Peterson?} was the worst! *.5 stars! But this is much better, albeit shorter..."
1,"Appropriate Title, for sure","This book could not be more aptly named. I feel decieved many times over. This book is masquerading as a piece of literature, while it is truly little more than a trite lot of drivel. The Main Character spends the whole book fawning over the Romantic interest and gets no where. I read fantasy fiction for tales of wonder and adventure. Not for examples of how stupid Hormone-ridden men can be easily duped. If you are a fan of the Fantasy Genre or even of Mr. Denning's other work, steer clear of this piece, because it will let you feeling down, confused, angry, and deceived. Just like me."
3,Life Signs,"It is an interesting and fun read, but upon closer examination, it just seems to be just another re-tread of current pop psychology. It is creative in its new lables for certain personality types, but do we really need more lables?The message is nice though and I am hopeful that Mr. Geller has found it helpful in his own life. It is always good when one practises what one preaches."
5,uri geller life signs,"uri geller life signs is very unique book. In this book there are nine different personality types based on ancient teachings.In this book uri explains how this knowledge can be used to understand our basic archetypes and further he proceeds give extraordinary useful information on relationships, self development coping with strees improving self confidence and enchancing performance.at last this book will guide you be more positive in life."
1,"for the coffee table, not the kitchen","I got this as a gift from my son, since I had just visited Tuscany last year and loved the food. I am an experienced gourmet cook. This book needed a test kitchen in the worst way. I tried two recipes: one for polenta (as basic as pasta) and a Garbanzo bean bread. The proportions for both were totally wrong. The polenta balled up in the pan, and the ""flat bread"" was like a soft egg dish. I checked in one of my favorite chef cookbooks (Sheila Lukins of Silver Palate fame) and the proportions were very different for the polenta. the other recipe couldn't find anywhere. I'm donating this one to the library for the Friends of the Library sale."
5,birthday gift,Beautiful photographs and excellent recipes make this a special gift for anyone who loves Italin food and especially if they have visited Tuscanny
5,Great Book,"My son (2 years) loves this book. He has learned all the motions for what happens on the bus and helps us out when we get to the right page... it often gets read two or three times a day. It is sturdy and has managed to stand up to throwing, chewing and operating as a step stool."
3,Cute but Kind of Small,I read the other reviews where they said the book was small but I didnt think it was this small. I like the graphics and of course you can't help but sing the song instead of reading it. I think the book should be priced at 2.99 instead of the 3.99 that I paid for it. At that price it would be pefect for the size.
4,Excellent,"My kitten absolutely loves this product. The wiggling fingers and dangling pom poms aren't that enticing to her, but what gets her going is when I grab her with it on my hand and she wrestles, bites, scratches, and kicks at it. She loves to gnaw at the pom poms as I'm ""grabbing"" at her. The material is pretty thick that resists sharp teeth and claws, but once in a while she will get too excited and I will feel a bite. The glove however is way too big and slips off easily, and my fingers get tired quickly from wiggling them."
1,A low-life's dream!,"After scanning through ALL 15 pages of reviews, I decide to sacrifice the one-Master 5401D- box I was fixing to bolt to a steel door by trying to break into it-ZERO lock pick experience.Clamped into a vise by it's sides; Using a medium blade screwdriver and a common claw hammer, it took FOUR hits, and not very hard ones at that, in the seam between door and body/ top left corner and this 'POS' popped open!!If you think your house contents are worth more than the cost of this garbage, and are thinking of installing it, buy one and give it a whack-four times!Also, the short screws are all but useless for a useless 'lock' box."
1,Stuck,"It worked for a few weeks during demos for family, but then stopped functioning for good. Nice idea, poor function."
4,Useful but limited,"I bought this product to hang by the door way entrance in my garage. I figured as soon as my wife or I park our cars, we put our car keys in here and know where they will be at all times. The problem is the device is really only meant for KEYS. Not your alarm remote or any other things hanging off of your key chain. Depending on what you have on your key chains, the space allotted is really limited. I filed my set of keys to one of our vehicles to make it work (guy thing, was determined to prove that it was a good buy). So, although great concept, I wish it had just a little bit more space to fit the entire key chain................."
2,NOT FOR CAR KEYS!!!!,This safe works fine for house keys and car valet keys but it is not large enough for even 1 car key with buttons on it. Two stars because it is so cheap.
1,MOST PECULIAR - does not open in freezing temperatures,"This is most peculiar, and perhapse only related to the specific unit I have, but when the box is cold, below freezing, it cannot be opened. I verified this by putting the box in my freezer and indeed, could not open it until it warmed up. When it was cold, the lever that unlatches the door would not move despite having the correct combination. As it warmed up, one could hear a click and then the lever would work. I came to this because once I had to sit outside freezing my tush, waiting for my wife, because the darn box would not budge. A few days later the weather was warm, the box opened, and my wife began to look at me funny."
4,Does the job,"I bought a couple of these for my rental properties and have only used one. It is at my own house. It is well worth the price to know that I will not get locked out of my house again. Also, if I unexpectedly need to let someone in my house, I can give them the combination and then reset the lock afterwards so they cannot get in later. I chose this model, which is screwed in with the screws only accessible when it is unlocked, because I though it would be less tempting to steal than the one that loops over the door lock. This model can go anywhere and be less noticeable. Also, I did not want anyone breaking the handle off of the door to get to the lockbox."
3,"Works Well, but One Major Flaw","I purchased this as a key storage at a second home that contractors were doing work in. It has worked great for them! I just give them the code and they are all set.I was hoping to use this once my second home became a rental. However, it has one major flaw. The code is changeable as the description says. However, anyone who has the code to open it can then change the code. So if I were to give the code to a renter, they could then change the code, effectively locking me out of my own key box.I will continue to use this for its convenience, but I would not trust the security of my primary home to it."
5,Great!,I loved watching this show as a kid..so great to be able to find all the seasons now on DVD and rewatch..
5,Finally!,"I was such a Charlies Angels fan as a child . . . and as an adult. I am so excited for this season! My bachelorette party was even a Charlies Angels theme. While I much preferred Kate over Shelly, my favorite episode, ""Fallen Angel,"" is in the 4th Season. I am very excited about this news!"
4,Glad it's out,"I enjoy the 4th season of Charlies Angels. Adding Tiffany as an angel wasn't a bad choice, but a week one. She wasn't as strong as the other two. But yet, she added her own character into the show.My favorites of hers was when she went back to her alma mater and helped find the missing girls. Another one where she helped her friend whose husband was trying to kill her and especially where she and Kris learned to drive the big rigs. The other one was where there was someone after the Angels and Toni's boys had to help them out. That would have been a great spin off into a new show.Adding it to your collection would not be a bad thing, especially for those shows that I've listed above. Enjoy!!"
1,What was this about????,"Great cast but terrible movie. If it was meant to be a comedy it sure was not funny in the least. If it was meant to be a drama it just plain made no sense. Was bored stiff, but watched it to the end. Big mistake, I could have been doing something more interesting like washing my hair or watching paint dry"
4,Classic Wes Anderson - non-stop hilarious subtle vignettes,"The story as told through dialog seems almost secondary when Wes Anderson is in full stride. The real story is being told in much finer detail via innumerable one second shots. It is here where the characters' personalities are crafted into sharp focus. The broader jokes such as stealing the use of his rival's facilities, then robbing the equipment as he leaves are almost vulgar in comparison to Anderson's defter touches. But it all works to make a good movie."
3,"Excellent film, but delivery was too slow to be of any use.","I paid for expedited shipping on this DVD, because I was hosting a ""Life Aquatic"" viewing at my home. On the day of the party, it hadn't arrived, so I streamed it off of Amazon.com instead. The quality of both the sound and video was terrible in the stream version, so now all of my guests think that both Wes Anderson and I are insipid. The next day, Amazon told me that they noticed the quality of the video was lousy, and that they would refund me for what I paid. The next day, the DVD also arrived. Too late.Even after such an disappointing experience, though, this remains one of the best films ever made."
1,I didn't get it,"I have been a fan of Bill Murray for as long as I can remember, and really enjoy most of the cast members in their other films. This one didn't do anything for me. I didn't laugh or cry or turn it off. I just watched until it was over. If you have absolutely nothing else you would rather be doing then watch it, but don't expect much in return."
5,if you dont get it,"i feel for anyone that did not enjoy this movie. you'd have to be a humorless, souless shell of a person to not recognize the genius. if you want to get a feel of someone just ask them if they liked this film. if they didn't then turn and run."
4,Just a little late,"DVD was fine, but I got it the day after Christmas! Luckily my daughter got so many gifts that she enjoyed getting one the day after all her others!"
1,Save yourself now and run,"Apparently, humor and originality are seemingly replaced by the bizarre and the boring. It was silly, incoherent and painful to watch. If you find things to be interesting because they are strange, then go for it. If you're looking for intelligent humor that is understandable, run now and save yourself."
1,I'm one of those people.,"I'm just one of those film critics who criticize everything. I'm the guy on the forums picking apart even the best films because of my lack of creative talent. I use words like, 'unsound', 'wretched', and 'inadmissible' to describe the talents of other people. This is usually just an act of defiance. Plus it draws attention to me at the yacht club gatherings. Yes, I am one of those people, the people you all hate. I am far from being a film maker, I am simply a film critic. I will never make a film. I will never even write a book. However, three seconds before I die, a light will flow over my eyes and I will see that I have wasted my life and the time of people like you. Honestly, this movie kicked ass, I know it, you know it."
2,Blah,Why this is a Criterion movie is beyond me... I expected more rigorous filtering of film quality from this series. Thanks for inspiring me to waste my money on what was easily a HBO/Showtime/etc freebie.
1,Pretentious Crap,"To every review I've read about this movie calling it ""intelligent"" humor that ""unintelligent people can't understand"", I respond with: it's pretentious, hipster bullcrap. This is a movie for people who want to talk down to others about their intellectual capacity, but fail to notice what they are using to feel superior is M-O-V-I-E. Ah yes, books require too long of an attention span, and there might be actual ""words"" you don't know and you'll have to look up! (boo-hoo)This movie wasted one of the best casts I've seen assembled in a long time. The characters were horribly underdeveloped, the drama unmoving. It was a two-hour long battle not to fall asleep.Coincedentally, this is also the last time I listen to a recommendation from anyone that finds Arrested Development amusing."
2,"pointless, unispired movie","I thought this would be a light-hearted comedy from viewing the trailer, but they must have put every remotely funny scene into it because this film was almost completely devoid of humor. I was at least hoping for a Lost in Translation type movie, but every character was a one-dimensional spoof that I found unfunny and uninteresting. Murray sleepwalks through his performance as the lead character and Wilson is a toned down version of all his other characters he's ever played. I was very disappointed in this one."
1,Bootleg copies,"I bought Seasons 1 through 7. When it arrived from Shanghi, China I was supicious. Upon carefully examining the first season I found it was in cardboard sleeves. Then I discovered the UPC code was incorrect and the stamps on the back of the CD's were also incorrect. The quality of the CD's were not bad for bootleg because the seller was crafty in the way he copied all the menus, etc., but it was not legit. Beware of a deal that looks too good to be true!"
1,Lost Item??,"I placed this order with European Grocery Store on September 21st. The order was supposed to be here by October 6th. It is now October 16th, and I still have not recieved my order. I have left 2 inquirys with Amazon.com, about my order. All I have recieved in return is auto generated messages that has nothing to do with finding my order. European Grocery Store does not offer tracking on their products, and I cannot get a response from them or Amazon.com. If this is the way European Grocery Store operates, I will not buy from them again. All I want is My product or my $141.00 refunded.Ken"
1,good stuff,I love this show.. not the best out of the star strek but 7 of 9 tends to make it the most of it ;) which is always ideal ;)... anyway i really like this show..its good stuff anyway who is a star trek fan should buy this set it goes for a nice price on this site ;)
3,Sad fan,I had to return it because the DVDs were defective. They started digitally breaking up and freezing. Totally unwatchable. This makes me very sad because I LOVE the Voyager videos.
1,Sad purchase,"The product came from China, the case consists of cheap rice paper and flimpsy cartboard. The disks have some kind of glue stains all over them which makes the disks skip during just about every episode. Plus every disk has extensive fingerprints on them. I was so looking forward watching this series with my son which is sad because we do not enjoy the disks skipping constantly. We tried watching them on a blue ray and an xbox as well same thing every episode skips or stalls for a few seconds.The selling price of 230 Dollars was way over priced due to the condition these disks are in."
3,Here's The Thing..,"Several of the jewell cases were damaged. Season 4 was quite bad. None of the dvd's seemed affected. But my only option was to return the entire set, and hope to get a better one, or return the one I have for a refund. I made some repairs, used wd-40 to get some of the goo which was on several of the plastic boxes which held the jewell cases. The quality of the dvd's is quite good and uniform. Repetetive intros, but kind of neat, all the extras from the VHS's are on last disk for each season. But I beleive the seasons are peiced together(to be expected) from different production runs. There were different types of shrink-wrap and security bars, etc. All in all pretty good, I wanted them for a long time, and the price $250.00 was right. probably will be $200 in near future."
4,Star Trek Voyager: Seasons 1-7,This series will go well with Star Trek: The Next Generation that I have. I have not yet watched Star Trek Voyager since I received the set but I did see most of the episodes when they were broadcast on TV. I am very happy to have this series.
3,StarTrekVoyager Seasons 1-7,"Item was cheapest($181) on line for 1-7 Series but upon inspection, found plastic case for Season 7 was smashed with pieces missing which means it was packaged for shipment to me with the seller knowing about the damage prior to shipment!Had to go to used book,dvd,cd outlet in Chattanooga, Tn, a 160 mile drive to buy another copy of one season's case to replace the broken case that was sent in the 1-7 set. Cost another $35. Set sent to me should not have been sent with damaged case without it being stated prior to sale! This sale was backed by Amazon. Item was not returned because next cheapest set was in $300-$400 range."
3,An OK baseball book,"This book is a short fast read a fairly detailed account of Terry Leach's major league career. While it contains almost no controversy or dirt, espicially when he was a member of the ""bad boy"" Late 80s Mets, the book is a good read when if you would like to know about the lesser players in baseball."
3,Things Happen For A Reason,This was a very simple easy read autobiography of a baseball player. It was enjoyable to read and being a Mets fan when he pitched made it all the more informative. The average sports fan may not read this book but all Mets and/or baseball fans should.
4,Roof Top Singers,I was very pleased with the Roof Top Singers Vanguard package as I have been looking for years for the Tomcat song.I have found Vanguard records to have put out a Quality product.
2,couldnt get past the first sentance,"if your like me and actually have respect for shamanism, then you might be put off by the very first thing you read in this book, so yes, I have not read the book so I do not know how good it is just want to give a heads up. and yes I understand that joseph campbell wrote it back in the ancient days when disrespect for things was rampant, but what ever."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"In the Hero with a Thousand Faces Joseph Campbell traces the myths and stories associated with the heroic archetype through all the varied cultures and types, also looking at a psychological viewpoint at times. Very interesting from a storytelling point of view, and at something that resonates so strongly around the world."
5,One of the most significant books of the 20th century,"This is an extraordinary text. What some of the other reviews suggest is that it is to be avoided if you think it will be an escapist treatise bridging the worlds of myth and fantasy. IF YOU EXPECT THIS TO BE LIKE STAR WARS DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.It is a journey to your own personal experience, as well as an exploration of the universal experience. It touches on our deepest fears and needs. It says much about our lives, our religions, and our civilisation. It is a sister text to Jung's autobiography. I found it gave me unique insights into my life, in all our heroic voyages, showing myth not to be the realm of fantasy, but of deep psychic truth. If this interests you read this, read Jung, and read The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, by Roberto Calasso."
1,Another Example of Joseph Campbell's Poor Scholarship,There is a major problem with Joseph Campbell's works regarding mythology: his claim that there is an overarching mytheme that transcends cultures is demonstrably false. Joseph Campbell is very good at EDITING myths (for example Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) to make it fit HIS mystical beliefs. One would be better served by ordering tapes on mythology supplied by the Teaching Company.There is a good reason why Sarah Lawrence College refused to accept Joseph Campbell's papers for archival purpuses (and at varience with its policies): his work is regardaded as New Age garbage.
2,Overrated,"Remarkable content. The writing style, however, is professorially pompous and pretentious. Campbell would have flunked English 1A for being wordy and torturing the English language."
3,Disappointing towards the end,"Too much emphasis on sex and gays towards the end of the book. No coverage of evening wonders at the World's Fair, professional sports after the Dodgers and Giants left town, and other important elements of Big Apple nightlife during the 60's and 70's. A disappointing end to a promising book."
2,This needs to be explained,"The description of the book...the entire book...IS JUST LIKE THAT. If you want to read 300 pages of that, go for it, if not don't. I would not reccommend it. It gets one star for unusual idea."
3,loved it ....until it broke in two,"I got this stroller when my son was 9 months old. We've had a fantastic year and a half with this stroller. I walk every day. I wore out the tires in one year and had to get new ones. Just this week I noticed the left wheel bowing inward but I couldn't see anything wrong. Well, yesterday I was out for a walk and the aluminum frame cracked and the stroller collapsed with my son in it. No one was hurt and luckily we were almost home. But boy am I angry...I thought I had bought a quality stoller, but now I consider it a piece of garbage! I had hoped it would last through two children but it didn't even last through one."
2,Frame Bent - I hope Amazon will replace it,"We received this from our registry and didn't use it until recently (because our son was too young), only to find that it pulls very hard to the left. On paper, it seems like a good product because it will go over all of the bumps and terrain that we walk on, but it isn't working for me because I have to walk my dog at the same time, and in order to keep it on track, I need both hands.I'm very disappointed..."
1,This stroller bit the dust,"The first one we bought pulled to the left and had a misplaced tire inflator. The second one also pulled, and a piece of plastic broke off the frame. So we gave up and got the Jeep All-Terrain stroller, which is way better anyways (and less expensive). Reebok should stick to shoes!"
5,Endearing Tale of a Minstrel and His Favorite Pet,"Rosemary Sutcliff is a superb writer, she has taken many of the ancient classics like the Iliad and Odyssey and brought them to a child level without losing the content and poetry of the stories.Here, she has written a book for elementary age children and like always had made it a very well told tale.The minstrel's dragon pup is stolen from him one night at an inn and a long time later he finds his dragon at a king's menagerie and he wants the dragon back without incurring the wrath of the king. This story is endearing and any child will relate to the relationship between a favored pet and a young boy.The illustrations, as in all her books, are excellent. Rosemary Sutcliff manages to entertain the adult reading aloud as well as the child, and that makes for a very good children's book."
5,Great read.,"Unique concepts, well thought out (although obviously non-existent) science, and good twists. Recommended for any reader that's into sci-fi and or suspense. This is a nerd writing for nerds, in nerd-lingo, which is why this book resonated with my brain a lot."
2,Maybe I discovered him too late,"Maybe I discovered Mr. Chiang too late. I read the rave reviews of his work and read part of the first story online, I became very enthusiastic. When I finally received the book in the mail I did have a pretty good time reading the first part of the first story. It was very original and the world building was better than I'd seen in years. But. It kind of got stuck right there. The second half of the story was a let down and the other stories in this collection didn't grab me at all. I gather that some of these stories are pretty old by now and perhaps I would have enjoyed them more if I'd read them when they first came out."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"THE DIFFICULT PUZZLES ARE TOO EASY. ALSO, IT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PRINT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR EACH CELL. YOU'D DO MUCH BETTER GOING ON LINE FOR SUDOKU PUZZLES"
2,Needs edible warning,"I purchased one of these for two 7 month old shepherds. I have used both the small (4"") and large versions. So far, I have purchased 5 of the small ones and 4 of the large ones. My dogs are crazy about them and, except for meat, they are the absolute best attention getter I have found for these two dogs. Our third dog, a 5 year old completely ignores them. I agree with one of the other posts that it is simply destroyed in less than an hour and often shredded within a day or two. They seem to be trying to get to the squeaky internal parts. What I have finally learned is that ""pony"" balls - actually made for horses, hold up much, much better even though they do not squeak. So clearly, the balls could be made tougher.I wish there was a more durable version!"
2,dog owner,Welsh terrier loved this ball. He is a relatively small dog (21 lbs) but an aggressive chewer. Unfortunately this ball did not hold up at all. He tore it to pieces within one week. It is very expensive to last such a short period of time. I was disappointed that it could not withstand his bite for a longer period of time. He was very upset when we had to take it away from him but he was just tearing off chunks of the ball and we were afraid he would choke on it.
2,Not for adult dogs.,"My adult dog and a friend of mine's adult dog neither one found this ball interesting enough to play with. Would probably be good for a curious puppy. The ""noise"" maker didn't work as well as expected."
1,Delay,"Dears,Have not yet received this item. Pls give me thr track number for trace it.Tis/Rgds.RossicomBoules Quies Protection Auditive Earplugs, Made in France"
4,Play LOUD,"Solo project by Tim Green (F*cking Champs, Nation of Ulysses). Fans of Tortoise and Trans Am will like this one. Some wonderful music."
1,BORING,"I got this for my history class, but it is so boring. I didn't even read most of it because I coun't get past the beginning it was too boring."
2,Incomplete and Biased,"I thought this text presented a very anti-American picture. While America's history includes actions that would draw criticism if weighed against current values, I don't think it is appropriate to apply modern values when judging leaders of our past in a textbook. Additionally, I found the text's use of facts one-sided, as exemplified by the omission of the significant MAGIC transcripts and the part they played in the decision to relocate those of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast during WWII. The only good thing I can say about the text is I found it easy to read."
4,holds its own ..in the 2000's,"Ive played nintendo 64's version of forsaken, i was instantly hooked. It's been 2 years since i've played the N64 version and i wanted another go at it. This time i decided to get the PC's version. The game has very impressive graphics, game play and sound for a game made almost 5 years ago. I warn you though it has fairly difficult game play. The game also has the ability to turn the most calm game player into a bundle of nerve's after a few hours of playing with the volume up."
1,Disappointing,What ball? My Jack Russell totally tore it up in no time at all. Can't find a decent toy for a dog that is going blind. Thought this would be great.
2,dog ball,Was disappointed in the size. It is to big for my small dog. She could not open her mouth wide enough to pick it up.This ball is good for medium to large size dogs.I will be giving this ball to the SPCA. That is way I did not send it back to you.
3,Not As Good As the First One,"The first one of these I bought for our Boston Terrier was great. It really made noises with little effort and it had the colored spots that actually stuck out from the ball so the ball was easier to grip with the mouth. This last one we bought is cheaper made. It is all smooth, and the noise is not so noisey like the first one we bought. To get any noise I really have to shake it around, the first one we had you barely touched it and it made moise. This will be the last one we own. Like everything else today, the quality is getting cheaper, but the price stays the same or goes up."
2,Not a giggle ball,"This item is called a ""giggly ball"", but it is not a giggle ball. A giggle ball makes a giggling sound when it hits the floor. This doesn't. It also a size small, but I have a toy poodle, and it is too big for his mouth. I do not recommend this item."
1,Not very durable,"I had a Wiggly Giggly ball for may dog that lasted about four months. She loved it and it was one of her favorite toys so I bought another one (I thought). This Wiggly Giggly isn't the same thing as I had before. The sounds are the same and the only difference in looks is this one has blue paw prints on it. However, the first one was very hard plastic. This one is made of a soft plastic. She destroyed it in about 10 to 15 minutes."
2,"Cute, but if your dog has teeth forget it!","I saw this in a catalog and thought it would be really fun for my Golden that was 1 1/2 years at the time. And when it came in the mail it was really cute, you shake it and it wiggled, and rolled around on it own, and we played with it for a good 10 minutes before she took a bite out of it. It said durable in the description and although it did feel hard enough to last, my pup took 15 minutes tops to destroy it. Buy this toy if you only plan to play with it once (very briefly!)"
3,Our Silky loved his New Puppy not Impressed,We had a Silky Terrier for 17 years. We got him a Giggle Ball a few years ago. He loved that thing. Bought this item for our 8 month old Yorkiepoo.She just looks at it. Item is great but doesn't excite all dogs.
2,Good Toy,"This is a cute toy, but isn't durable for a lab puppy. My puppy, who is 1 years old, chewed up this toy during the week that i got it in the mail. The plastic covering seems hard, toy is very cute, and attracts a dog's attention, but i think that you might need a sturdier toy for a dog who loves to chew and play!"
5,Classics Today gives it a 9 / 9,"I have heard this is highly recommended by a njumber of sources. Classics Today gave it a 9/9, but Classics Today gave the Reiner version a 10/10 for sound - even though some folks say there is audible tape hiss!?!This one is 5.1 channel surround sound, while Reiner's is 3 channel. Probably can't go wrong with either version. This one has the piano version of the Pictures as well, and two versions of Night.... The Reiner version has a variety of pieces by other composers in addition to Pictures and Night.I hear Karajan's and Szell's versions are also top notch - but haven't heard them."
5,wolverine review,This is a handy gadget. I didn't have to take my laptop withe me on my trip. I just downloaded the images into the wolverine. Before I left I used it to transfer files from my laptop to different computers.
2,LAME....,"Do not trust the critics in this one! The story of a whiny housewife who gets fired up over mediocre things her 'oh so evil' mother in law does to drive her crazy. There was not one incident in the story that was dramatic enough to be the least bit entertaining, or humorous at that. I hate to put it this way, but before you commit to reading this book you may want to open it up to the back sleeve and look at the picture of the FABULOUS author Jane Green."
2,don't waste your $$,"I loved all of Jane Green's books so I had to get this one. I was very disappointed in the long, drawn out book that I nearly put down 1/2 way through. The main character is uninteresting and spends the entire novel whining. Unlike her other books, this one wasn't even funny. Check out any other Jane Green, but leave this one on the shelf."
2,completely boring,"Despite the fact that this mother-in-law reminded me of my own in many ways, this was one of the most boring books I've ever read. I was sucked in by the reviews of the author's previous novels (on the back cover), and this book was neither funny, witty, or clever. False advertising! It was dry, unwitty, uninteresting, etc. I couldn't believe I wasted my time on it."
1,PLEASE kill off the main character,This has to be the most annoying protagonist in the history of literature. I kept wanting her to be hit by a bus so the rest of the characters could live happily ever after.The writing was so choppy and disjointed that I had to force myself to finish it. Very disappointing because I have enjoyed several of Ms. Green's other books.How DID this get published?
1,Boring,"This book is Jane Green's worse. There is nothing going on and I could care less about any of the characters. The book, I guess, is about Ellie not liking her ""controling"" mother-in-law. Well, I see nothing wrong with the mother-in-law. What grandmother does not want to see and hold their grandchild? Ellie gets way to emotional about the stupidest things. This character really gets on my nerves. I am stuggling to finish it but I hope the ending is her husband dumps her and she is all alone wishing she had the ""controling"" mother-in-law back. The only way I would recommend this book is if you are having a hard time falling asleep at nite and do not want to take a sleeping pill. This book would definalty help you get to sleep!"
4,Beautiful book,"bought the book for the pictures and the paragraph about each one. haven't read most of the text and don't particularly care to.a shoulder surfer actually thought some of the wheels were real, the reproductions are that good.4 out of 5 because I didn't read/rate the text."
4,Good buy,"For the small amout you pay for this useful tool, you sure will get your money's worth. I bought this for my father to use, he loves to tinker, and he really is using it. If you are considering this as a purchase I urge you to buy! :-D"
5,Christmas Present,The kid I bought this for hasn't put it down since christmas. He likes how it operates and loves the color
5,Just like the reviews stated.,This flashlight is very powerful and rugged. This is one that my 5 year old son hasn't broken and he has broken Mag lights. I have been showing it off to friends and neighbors. You should see the look on their faces when I drop it on the cement 6' drop. Never have I seen a flash light as powerful as this one. I will buy another one or two in the future.
5,Amazing Short Stories,"Mindstorms is one book of three similar collections of stories by acclaimed Young Adult author Neal Shusterman. The stories are weird and scary, and although they aren't too much for your average 10-14 year old, they also amuse this 40+ year old.Two Jewish children are hiding in at attic in Nazi Germany, where they steal looks out a window, despite the danger.A boy returning from a family vacation finds his luggage has gone astray, to be replaced by a similar bag with clothes that fit, except they are intended for someone with a third arm.A girl and her family flee desperately from sunrise after the Sun goes nova.A young boy goes missing on a family trip to Mexico. He disappears into thin air.A teenager has to die 350 million years in the past or we will never evolve."
1,Bush is not a Christian,"This book is loaded with innacurate information about Bush. It fails to mention how he believes in capital punishment and is actually in the Guinness Book of World Records for putting to death more inmates (152) than any other governor in US history. Where did this author get some of this stuff? Bush has used religion to propel him into power. He is not a Christian because he is not in any way Christ-like. He hijacked our Lord and Savior. He is an occupier of innocent countries, a killer of innocent people, and he will, in the end, destroy the reputation of Christianity as a whole. How much did Bush pay this author for this book? Jesus is weeping...."
1,Junk,"Got it yesteday, sending back today. A piece of junk. Made in El Salvador. Should not sell for more than a dollar"
3,Kidd's fabled treasure?,"Richard Knight's story of an adventure worthy of a pirate is certainly interesting, though it leaves one with more questions than answers. His claim of finding a map belonging to Kidd (as well as evidence of three others that are like the first) is a bit difficult to swallow, especially since there is no photograph of it in the photo section. The treasure, supposedly conveniently located in extremely hostile territory (a Vietnamese coastal island) also is missing, although he claims to have recovered some of it. He also stated an intention to return and get the rest some day, which is his reason for not filling us in on the important details. Too many holes, Mr. Knight, but I'll be happy to apologize should you turn up with the goods!"
3,"beam me up, Stanley","The music here seems like it came from some science fiction feature or science documentary. The playing, effects and themes make this entertaining, and several songs have a real ""searching where no man has gone before"" feel. Unfortunately, some songs seem like quick fillers. Overall though some good tunes, even though the effects would seem to date some of these songs as much as the original Star Trek uniforms."
3,Not impressed with it,I have an AMD 64 3000+ on an Asus K8VSEDX board and the chip had a retail fan and heatsink that came with it. The temp was around 51C with the manufacturer's fan. So now here comes the Thermaltakes sonic tower heat sink.First thing you notice is that the heatsink is HUGE (I did know before hand yet I still wasn't prepared) but was a straight forward install. Just had a hard time screwing the two screws in because of tight space. I didn't install any optional fan on the heatsink. Rebooted the box and watched the temp and it stabilized around 55C. So definitely its NOT cooler but the passive cooling eliminated some noise from my box. Now all I hear is my video card's fan going crazy.CPU 55C
4,It's great for beginners,"I consider this video an excellent place to start if you are just beginning pilates. The first part focuses on breathing and proper technique, this may be slow, but in my opinion it is vital if you wish to benefit fully from your workout.It may also be necessary to complete this video a few times before you are completely efficient and have good technique and breathing without being reminded by the instructor. And still a few times more before you are competent enough for the intermediate video which is more difficult.The atmosphere is relaxing and the instructor is soft spoken and pleasant. She is encouraging but she hardly has the irritating cheerleader-like approach that many other exercise video instructors have.The only reason I gave this video four stars instead of five was the slowness in the first part of the video that I mentioned previously. But as a whole I consider it a good introduction to pilates."
1,"For The Love Of God, Make Her Stop!!","I can't get past the first couple chapters. The book is scattered, hard to read and basically unenjoyable. A complete waste of time and money. Plus the foundation of this pseudo-doctor's feeding regime is the Pottinger Cat Study. This is an antequated study from the 1930's that had no controls. Reading it, any nutritionist worth their salt would know the diet Pottenger fed lacked taurine which caused his problems. Why doesn't Dr. Yarnall? Now, we have that and much more in today's food. How else can generations of cats reproducing year after year and living long heathly lives on commercial diets. This book is just one big long scare tactic to sell her product.But, it has one pratical use. It's a great sleep aid."
1,cheep,I tried it a few times. The action of the keys are poor. The little wrist rest falls off. It slides around too easy. Try it out in a store before you buy one.
1,doesn't work or randomly works- don't buy,"This Product works rundomly, and most of the time doesn't. waste of money, the worst products in this category!!!"
5,Nice!! This is sweet!,"The Fang is amazing!!!!! I just got it,theres nothing like it. The keyz are in the perfect spot to kill all your fellow gamers. all you need is the fang and a mouse and your good to go. you have to get this if you want to stand a chance in FPS games."
1,Does not fit my decanter,"My decanter has a narrow neck (about 1"" at the narrowest point, flaring out to 2"" at the lip). This brush is too big to fit it. Check your decanter before ordering or you will be wasting money. I was very disappointed because this brush and this decanter are shown explicitly together on the ""frequently bought together"" section.Here is the reference to my decanterhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P7O518/ref=ox_ya_oh_product?ie=UTF8&redirect;=true"
4,NIce intro,"Nice book for starters, where you can't afford or can't access a teacher. It really starts you going in the right direction. Of course, voice lessons are the optimum, but this is a big help for beginners."
5,"Track Listing, Track Listing....",1. Perfect Light2. Chosen One3. Reckless Child4. Cocaine5. Sydney 20006. My Dull Surprise7. Strange Memories8. Walking Home9. You're Gorgeous10. Criket Club Porn Night11. Pearl12. Red Smoke Across The Square13. History
5,An excellent book for the leisure reader of science fiction.,This is a great book that could be taken to the 3 sequel level. It is something that all of us dream of at some time in our lives. To heal with a touch or on the other hand to take a life in the same way. To know what someone is thinking or planning just by shaking their hand. The story revolves around a young man that has grown up under the government's thumb and is now being used by that same government. He rebels and escapes. This book is easy to read and holds your interest. And I might add leaves you wanting more.
1,tv/dvd viewing is bad for babies under 2yrs,"haven't used this because I discovered that tv and dvd viewing is harmful for babies under 2 years of age (can cause attention deficit disorder, obesity, behavioral problems, etc.) ... and in veiwing one of the dvds myself, I found it to be mostly unenjoyable."
3,hooked on baby,baby babble is far superior in teaching and holding interest. but this is a very good set of dvds
4,"Great seller, mediocre product",Delivery was very fast. Product in good shape but not what I expected...not the sellers fault though
4,Awesome Choral A Cappella,Almost achingly beautiful harmonies at times...has a modern slant (but not too out there). Superbly written and performed.
3,canon calculator,adequate but need to get used to the logic. On my previous calculator if I wanted to know what 100 minus 10 equaled I would type 100 + 10 - and the result would be 90. If I use this same logic on the Canon I get 110. The logic requires typing 100 - 10 = which gets me to 90. So it should be fine once I get used to it.
5,Great Gasket,"I use this gasket on all BBFs as opposed to the 4 piece older style gasket. When using this gasket on some older engines, the 'corner' holes may need to be opened up a bit to allow a larger bolt to pass through... you can pop out the insert with a razor blade and a screw driver. No leaks!"
5,Lithuania's Best,"I bought two bottles of this stuff in Vilnius back in '06. It is amazing and unlike anything I've been able to find elsewhere. I've spent a lot of time playing around with Tom Ford's fragrances and even those don't come close to what this gives out. It's amber, corriander, sandlewood, berries.. it's earthy and velvety. You can find lots of amber perfumes around but there is nothing like this.. anywhere."
5,Loved This Book,"When the planets are aligned, magic happens. Bill Allard is smart about the rise and fall of dotcom America in the way only someone who was at the center of that great bubble can be smart. Bill Allard is funny about the rise and fall of dotcom America in the way only someone who has spent the last three decades as a master comedian and filmmaker can be funny. This is a perfectly irresistible book."
5,Better than the Rumble!,"Last months Royal Rumble was typical of WWF Rumbles, everything on the card is great except the Rumble match itself. But this pay-per-view more than makes up for any bad feelings you have toward the WWF, with The Rock and Mankind going at it again in another brutal contest that is a classic. No matter how many times they feud it still makes for must-see match-ups. The main event though as got to be Austin and McMahon in a steel cage match, where Vinnie Mc takes more bumps then Mankind, a brilliant event where you knew Vince would have something up his sleeve. Even though he has promised no interference from any Coporate members, no Rock, no Bossman, no Kane, no Chyna, Vince McMahon will always manage to screw Austin. This is the best pay-per-view of 1999!"
4,Suitable for your favorite coffee or art house,"More of a crooner like Frank Sinatra or Harry Connick Jr. than a rocker, Randy Wooten and company combine big band style drumming with eclectic piano arraignments to create a soundtrack suitable for your favorite coffee or art house."
1,wrong picture,the pollenex dm209 pictured has the water pressure knob but the pollenex dm209 I received did not have the water pressure knob but it did say it was the dm209 but was a different model. i still have the old model and on it says the number is dm109-209. If you can assist me i would like to have the old model pollenex dm109-209 with the water regulator on it.
5,Front Row Tickets!,"Watching Yanni Live! is like Charlie winning the Golden Ticket. You are up close and personal to Yanni and his band. It's beautiful to watch because you can see that every single band member and Yanni are having the time of their lives. They're having fun with each other, entertaining the crowd, and it makes you feel like you're right there sitting in the front row. This DVD is beautifully done and it's a concert you'll want to see again and again, not just once and store it on a shelf.My mom used to hate Yanni. She sat down with my and watched this DVD concert and fell in love. Yanni truely is a master. This is so much fun to watch and the music is terrific."
5,Great Concert !!! Worth it in blu-ray.,"The video and audio quality of this is great -- I own the Acropolis concert in DVD, although I love that concert, the audio and video quality of this one is way much better than the Acropolis.Yanni's music is always very inspiring and the musicians are wonderful -- I especially love the duel between the saxophone and violin."
1,Yanni the Concert Event,I was terribly disappointed in this DVD because it does not have the complete concert from beginning to end. It's title is amisnomer because it leads to believe that the DVD captures the complete concert event while it only shows a few of the many songs that he performed live at the Mandalay Bay hall. Save your money
3,Good price for a home shop,"A gift for son in law, rounding out his assortment in the tractor shed. Heat treat adequate, good enough for occasional use."
5,Looks very interesting and entertaining!,"I've only seen a couple of clips from this documentary, but it looks very interesting and I can't wait to watch the DVD. I've heard a lot about William S. Burroughs, but it will be telling to listen to some of people that knew and worked with him. Frankly, I will be ordering the DVD based on my past experience with Oscilloscope titles, such as ""Howl"" and ""Exit through the Gift Shop"". I haven't been disappointed yet!"
3,Subtitles,"To be honest, there is no subtitles at all. I want to see subtitles for the hearing impaired."
5,"an interesting, exciting and captivating show",I watched this show because my dad thought it would be interwsting. It turned out to be the best show I have ever watched on television. The plot is new and every episode makes you have to stay and watch the next one. This is such an exciting show worth your money!
3,Why No Subtitles?,I think others have said what I want to say : I love this kind of stories and I enjoyed this DVD.Just one technical thing to complain. Why there are no English subtitles? I sometimes watch DVDs during the nights when the kids have gone to bed. It would be great if there are English subtitles so I can still catch all lines even though I have turned down the volume.
2,Wrong Item - Not One Tool Version - Be Careful,"Like the other reviewer - I ordered the Master Lock 3464DAT One Tool Torque Hitch Ball - but received a different ball. I did receive a Master Lock ball, but it was a regular ball, not the One Tool version this listing shows. It's a fine ball, but you don't get what you expect. Be careful. If you really need the One Tool Torque version - I'd suggest you shop elsewhere."
5,Great Music!,In a world full of the same type of singer that you never really can tell who's who because they all sound so much alike...I was thrilled to hear someone that had her own sound! This CD is such a relief! Thank you Mindy for having such talent!
3,"Not up to the pre-release hype, but a good first ...","Pre-release critics claimed this album was worth the hype, a true original. I don't think it quite measures up, but it's a worthy first effort. Nice voice ( a little too much like Alison Krauss to be really original) and good musicianship on the recordings. Given time and some more life experience, I think she'll mature into an excellent artist and songwriter."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I was first introduced to Mindy Smith when a bunch of friends took me to hear her play. AMAZING. I had been working on the idea that we are living in a great time of women singer/songwriters and gladly include Mindy in that group. Her live performance was so powerful and full of true unapologetic emotion and strength that I came right home and ordered this CD.But, while tracks 1, 11, and 12 carry the power of her live performance, the others strike me as slightly insipid. I can only wonder what happened in the studio to produce this flat collection of songs from a woman with so much fire."
2,Definitely Did Not Live Up to Promise of Single,"I was shocked and disappointed by every track on this album other than the first and last. ""Come to Jesus"" is gorgeous and deep, but the rest is pure forgettable ""chick flick"" soundtrack fluff. Her cover of ""Jolene"" is more than competant, it borders on stunning as does ""Come to Jesus"" but the rest is pure crap. It was a pleasant suprise to here Dolly P. backing her up here on ""Jolene"", they harmomize wonderfully together. Angelic! But save yourself the trauma and money and buy something else unless you think those two songs are worth the asking price."
4,Give Me A Break,"To the reviewer so had a problem with Mindy, ""Flakking to the big J-(Jesus)"". Man oh man dude-give me a break. This song is in no way flakking to Jesus or hitting you over the head with Christ. I think it is beautiful that Mindy opens the disk up to a subject that is obviously very important to her-her faith. I can't think of anything more important for an artist to sing about than what they truly believe in and what is important to them. I for one think that this album deserves a lot of credit for taking risks and being original."
4,"not my usual cup of tea, but wow","Let me start by saying my usual listening habits involve bands like Devin Townsend, Opeth, Type O Negative, Soilwork, etc. So, for me to like something in the country/folk genre is quite a stretch. Well, Mindy has provided a way for that stretch. I first saw her on Conan O'Brien and was instantly impressed with her voice. So many vocalists try to spice up their style with pointless techniques like vibrato or falsetto, etc. Mindy's voice is so pure and refined that it just glides into your ear and permeates your head. I've been waiting a long time to hear a female vocalist with such a pure voice. Songs liks Come to Jesus and Fighting For It All display a very strong talent for good songwriting. I love this CD and hope other metalheads can branch out and discover this diamond in the rough."
1,Oster 6-Slice - Not So Great,"Nice looks, but unreliable product. The timer broke after 8 months. It also takes a long time to toast. We have been searching for a few years for a quality toaster oven for a decent price. This one was disappointing."
1,"NO, ""KISS MY A**""","IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU WILL BE SO VERY SORRY... VERY BAD AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY...HAS ANYBODY NOTICED THAT ALL KISS DVD'S ARE THIS WAY ??? IT IS BLATANT..WHY, BECAUSE IF THEY EVER SOLD SOMETHING DECENT, THEN WE WOULD BE CONTENT AND QUIT BUYING THEIR LOUSY DVD'S WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING THE KISS EXPERIENCE AT HOME... IT'S A MARKETING PLOY, AND THIS IS THE FORTH TIME I HAVE FALLEN FOR IT...WELL GUESS WHAT, KISS MY A** ONCE AND FOR ALL...I HOPE KISS CHO**S ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK, BECAUSE KISS SU**S...DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET DREAM THEATER IN BUDOKAN INSTEAD...THIS IS WHAT A CONCERT DVD IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE..."
1,This book says nothing!,"I agree with Mr. Lentini. If you want to learn something about fuzzy logic - look for some other book. This is actually a booklet that only characterizes Fuzzy Logic in a very childish manner. The translator is an utter ignorant: Leibnitz is called ""Ripunitz"" and Aristole is ""Alistoter"" or something like that (probably following the Japanese transcription...). Even 1 cent is a waste for it."
1,This should get zero stars.,"I guess Buffet-Crampon needed to save some expenses on this product, so they shortened the pull string. The trouble is, the string is so short that IT IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE CLARINET unless the clarinet is taken completely apart, that is, not only the barrel but also the top and bottom joints must be separated to make it possible for this swab to get through any part of the clarinet. The result is that this swab is absolutely worthless. Shame on Buffet-Crampon! They should market the swab that they supply with their R13 clarinets, which is an excellent swab; but you apparently can't get one unless you buy one of their new clarinets."
5,Great Book,In this book Dr. Leroy Thompson Sr. breaks every word down for you. He has written this book and has made it very simple for anybody to read. Very Very good book. I will never be broke another day in my life. I know that's right!
2,wow,Had this sent to afganistan to play around with our throwing knives and after juss a few hits the metal around the edge was destroyed. The target is falling apart after only one day of use. Not that great in my opinion
