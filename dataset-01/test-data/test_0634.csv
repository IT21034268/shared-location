4,Worth the money!,"I was debating whether to purchase this book, based on some of the reviews here as the book being a ""crutch"". I ordered it on-line, sight unseen, and I am so glad I did! I have her other book ""Tarot According to You"" and I was real curious about what her other book was about. I did a reading just the other day, and I was amazed! I am a single mom of two young boys, plus going to school and really have a lot of my plate right now. In the romance category, it said I would NOT really be involved with anyone, since I am so overwhelmed with too many responsibilites! Then it said not to take on anymore projects and concentrate on whats at hand(I tend to be an overachiever and try to do new things all the time) I'm totally amazed! I'm working on her other book now and I hope I will develop more insight into tarot."
3,Nice product,"The mp3 player works fine, but in a week the fast forward button broke. The price was great, but the buttons need to be checked."
2,Two fifty foot women were enough for me,"Fred Olen Ray just loves to spoof films with his playboy model actresses and their exploits of loose virtue. It is difficult, though, to relate to a main character filled with a narcissistic obsession with her own appearance and no love interest until the last five minutes of the film. He is faithful to the first two versions in one way. When boy might really lay the girl, he must quit doing that before legal authorities interrupt. Special effects are pretty good until they attempt to emulate the crowd and city street scenes in the previous versions. Jay Richardson survives a piercing by a giant hypo needle like somebody scratched him, and it's sad to see Fatburger fold mostly out of business after it was used in one scene of the film!"
4,Great Book for finding spiritual life in the real world,"I have read this and used it for those struggling with the various 12 step programs AA, NA, CA, SLAA, EA, etc. Especially for young readers, the author's plain language and simple thought lines helps tremendously. As the Original 12 step program's books point out, this is a great way to live a better life even if you aren't a drunk or addict. Worth reading. Also - the Author is the grandfather of Polly Klaas who was plucked out of her house and brutally raped and murdered years ago. Her case was famously part of the movement to identify predators and keep track of them. I recommend this book."
5,Excellent book for recovery from ANYTHING,"I have read and reread this book many times. I have also given it to colleagues and personal friends. It explains the 12-step method for overcoming unhappiness and it is conveyed in an easy-to-understand manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially for people wishing to gain a better understanding of the 12-steps."
5,Very enjoyable!,"This book proves that the job of a park ranger is much more than answering vistor's questions. Before each group of stories, there are chapters titled ""Setting the Stage"" in which the author gives background information on each location. The stories, such as ""Water, Water, Everywhere..."", are very funny and great to read. In addition, there are tips at the back of the book for those wanting to go visit national park."
5,Funnier than Expected,"My wife and I own a Bed and Breakfast in Tucson and we had the privilege of hosting Jim and Velma for a few days. I am also a wildlife photographer and have been to many of the National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, etc. So, Jim and I had a great time sharing stories. However, when I later read his book I realized how ""funny"" he could tell his stories. The stories are funny in and of themselves, however, he is able to add an additional sense of humor in telling them. I loved his Acronyms. He is truly ""gifted"" this way. He's not just a Ranger, he is a wonderful writer and story teller. I thoroughly enjoyed each ""episode."" If you have ever been to any of the National Parks, you'll relate to and love the stories. He kept me ""howling"" the whole time."
2,lame,Did not enjoy this book at all. I thought most stories took too long to get to the point. Maybe I don't have the right sense of humor but reading about people doing stupid things doesn't always translate to funny.
2,Predictable and somewhat blah.,"I've been a park ranger for 18 years and was a backcountry volunteer for 16 years before that. Yes, some of this stuff was amusing, and some of it has happened to me and rangers I know. But Ranger Burnett's writing style, particularly his made-up acronyms (in a profession filled with real acronyms, anyhow) and quotes from ""high literature"" that seem to have little relevance but to take up space, grated on me after a short while. (The ""chickens in the Buffalo River"" chapter was good, though.) If you want to read about rangers and our job, get Nancy Muleady-Mecham's ""Park Ranger"" (2004, VTP) It's an excellent book."
5,A Great American Hero,"I absolutely love watching this DVD about the last great American hero that this country has seen, what a wonderful experience."
1,my opinion,item arrived damaged beyond repair. seller issued a full refund but was nowhere to be found after he offered a replacement. will never buy from them again.
4,"This book is filled with interesting, short stories!","It allows a further look into the lives of Camber's children and the healer, Rhys Thuryn. I reccomend it to people who would like to learn more about the Deryni world."
5,I worked there too.,"I look forward to reading this book. I was a Nuclear Engineer at Rocky Flats in the 80's. I quit after less than a year on site because I feared for my health. The plant was a mess. Everyone should read about what the cold war did to our country.*I have read the book now* and I can say honestly that what I knew then was not half what I know now....this Nuclear plant was a disaster. I quit for fear for my health, and now I know I did the right thing....EVERY American should read this book...The price that the weapons race cost our country. And to think that suburban Denver is only a short distance away from this site...scarey."
5,The Eternity Brigade,"The first book I ever read, that I went cover to cover with out putting down. A book well ahead of it's time in both it's ideas of future warfare, and our society of the future. A well thought out storyline that take us from a certainly plauable near-future. To a far distant one, that remains fresh and insightful today as it did when first published. A must for all true sci-fi fans."
1,Did not stick to window frame,The film was awkward to handle and adhesive strip did not stick to my type of window frame. had to throw out a big tangled mess.
2,"Worst kit, period","I've been using plastic window film in the winters since 2005, and this is the worst purchase choice I've ever made for them. The plastic only comes in one huge sheet, so you have to cut it down to put it up on the windows. The measurements work out to be so precise, that to cover the advertised ""5 windows"" at 3x5' each, you must cut this so perfectly that you have no extra plastic to work with on the edges. The tolerances are absurdly low, unrealistic to the point of idiocy. Add to that the entire IDEA of just providing one sheet of plastic, versus giving you 5 separate plastic pre-cut sheets, and this product becomes laughable. I'll be going with pre-cut multi-window packages in the future."
1,Worthless,"This product is absolutely worthless. The tape did not stick to either the window or even the plastic! Every time you tried to pull the plastic towards the side or bottom of the window, one of the sides already applied would pull off. And don't tell me I was using too small a piece. I had plenty of slack around the window. I ended up having to put scotch tape around the perimeter of the plastic just to make it stay. I had read some reviews on the 3M product, but could only find the Duck Brand. After attempting to install it last night with absolutely no luck, I came to read the reviews here to see what others thought.Too often I suspect the Company itself peppers in rosy reviews for the product. I can't imagine who the person is who can make this product work as it claims. For those who have had the same problem as I did, don't get sucked into the ""you should have read the instructions first"" admonition...as though its an operator problem. Bottom line, this product DOES NOT WORK."
1,Horrible!,"Not as simple as they make it sound! Trying to cut flimsy plastic that comes in a folded mess of 62"" x ""420 is not exactly simple. Taking mine back to the ""Wal"" store I got it at and will shop elswhere. After I finally got a sheet cut it pulled away from the tape after 1 week! HORRIBLE PRODUCT. Don't waste your time, spend a little more and get a quality product!"
4,window kit,"The tape is still working after a month not bad for the price, a lot cheaper than other brands I looked at."
3,Plenty of plastic but the tape is weak.,"Good quality plastic. My only complaint is the two sided tape would never work. Mostly a waste. If you buy this, go to your local super store and get some quality 3M double sided tape."
1,Does not work,"It is unable to hold up drafts, is too noisy. The film started giving up the next day at the tape. The film kept flapping in the night. Might not be the fault of this specific brand, but just the concept in general."
3,Package not clear on usage,"I'm sure this would have been a good product, but the appropriate surfaces were not well explained on the package. This product cannot be used on stained wood with no varnish. It may be obvious to some (and makes sense after thinking about it) but it didn't specifically list ""stained wood"" until you open the package. It does say that it is not for unfinished/unvarnished on the outside, but I didn't consider the bare-stained wood. And I'm sure the heat from the hair-dryer wouldn't be good for the stain. I'm glad I didn't try it out.Had it been clear from the start, I would not have purchased the inappropriate product."
5,Good quality,"I've used other ""shrink wrap kits"" in the past by other companies, but decided to go with Duck brand this time. In addition to feeling a bit thicker (not much, but noticeable), it had a nice touch of including alcohol pads to clean the area in advance.I have absolutely no problems with this product and will likely use it again next year (I bought 3 more of them just in case they weren't offered next year)!"
2,Cold weather,This concept is great but it is very time consuming to install and does not stay on the window properly.
5,WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A REAL BEAUTY,"SO MANY WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A REAL BEAUTY; MANY FROM THE YOUNGER DAYS. A TALENT AND A KNOCKOUT-WHO WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO BE JUDY GARLAND BACK IN THE DAY! SO MANY OF THESE PHOTOS COULD BE FRAMED. THIS BOOK IS JUST AMAZING AND YOU WILL LOOK AT IT AND SAY ""OH!"" 5 STARS! A++++++"
5,the right tool for the job,"worked perfectly. In fact, made easy what could have been an impossible job. I did 20 heads, and 18 came out in 30 seconds or less. It turns out that 2 had little pebbles that had fallen in due to nearby construction. The pebbles jammed into the grooves and the more I cranked, the more wedged in they got. So, if you're having real issues, get a screw driver in there and loosen up the debris before continuing."
1,Horrifying and Sad,"There are many rapes in this book. Most of them done by the Hero's father. Burr hates his father but as far as I could tell is a lot like him. He emotionally and verabally abuses Johanna. All their sex scenes reminded me of rape, and he actually hates the heroine when they get married and only discovers he likes her when she almost dies. The secondary characters' romance between Burr's half-brother and Johanna's sister was much nicer. Burr's brother made a much better Hero. He was sweet and kind and caring and I couldn't believe he was even related to Burr. But he should have confronted Burr about his treatment of Johanna. I cried through most of this book and it made me sick to my stomach. I love most of Dorothy Garlocks books, but I borrowed this from the library or I would have tossed in in the trash.Read these Dorothy Garlock books instead:Ribbon in the Sky,With Song,With Heart,After the Parade,Yesteryear"
2,Be aware of the barbed end diameter,"The description on the product packaging states 1/2"" barb x 3/4"" MNPT. However the barbed end is too narrow for standard 1/2"" ID plastic water pipe, it will probably fit a 3/8"" diameter pipe or perhaps only the RainBird Flexible Swing Pipe which has an OD of .49""."
4,A few issues,"The brush itself is soft, and creates an incredibly rich lather. I love it to death, but I'm afraid that I got ripped off, no where on the box states that this is 100% Pure SILVER TIP! What morons, this really isn't silver tip, but it still WORKS GREAT!!! Buy it if you want the top of the like Pure BADGER HAIR brush, and I really don't think it is Silver Tip."
1,Awful sound mix,"Totally agree with a previous review about the sound mix on the Blu-ray disc - it's awful. You get 3 options, DTS-HD, Dolby 5.1, and LPCM. Both the DTS-HD and Dolby 5.1 are terrible - you can barely hear the guitar and anytime the keyboard plays it is way louder than all the other instruments. The only way this disc is watchable is by using the LPCM audio option, which doesn't suffer from the bad audio mixing, but still isn't worth paying extra for Blu-ray. Don't know if this is a problem with my player - it's a Panasonic DMP-BD35, but if you're looking for sweet DTS-HD sound, keep looking."
3,THE GLASS IS HALF_FULL,"The original Asia line-up in Japan? Sounds little a dream come true, and for the most part it is. However, once we enjoy all those great Asia classics, we have to put up with rather pedestrian versions of classics like ""Court of the Crimson King"", Roundabout"" and ""Fanfare for the Common Man"". And these versions are completely out of place and no more than filler. So, three stars for excessive pointlessness."
1,How could they do that?,"...This is hideous! Those ""songs"" are the ugliest sounds I have ever heard! How could Rammstein authorize such mischief? They were probably forced under a muzzle to sign the authorization.All of the artists [stink] a lot. They have neither talent nor ability to play music whatsoever. What was done is the great damage to the popularity of the greatest band ever, Rammstein."
1,Just Horrible!,"It was suppose to be a ""Tribute to Rammstein"" not ""Make Rammstein look bad"". Completely destroys the essence and core of each of the original songs. Just listen to the previews, you'll find out how bad they are."
1,THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER,You would have to be drunk to buy this. It is severely making fun of Rammstein. Who ever made this CD needs to be shot. Stick with the real Rammstein songs. Unless you want to waste money and help whoever made this CD get money for ripping you off. I am a major Rammstein fan and wont even consider this CD.
1,I'm Speechless,"I'm not some big Jewel fan, but the woman did used to put out some sincere, heartfelt, and pretty well-written music. How did she go from melodic folk/acoustic, to sounding like a Britney Spears reject??I am not kidding, when I heard this song, I wanted to cry, because it was just so tragic to see Jewel like this. With her new music+image, I doubt she'll continue on with her career in a good fashion. My only question, is why???Her old style of music is what made her so succesful in the first place, why go and turn yourself into a boring pop star??A new direction is great, but this is too much. I'm sorry, but she just sounds ridiculous over the cheap,overproduced pop beats, her once effective vocals glossed over with sound effects, and the bland,sometimes silly lyrics(even kate moss can't get a job??)What in the world???I'll never be able to figure out why Jewel took the talent she had and threw it out the window. Is she purposefully trying to end her career??"
4,!,"Yet another band originating from the same Memphis axis that brought the world the Oblivians, the Compulsive Gamblers, and Reigning Sound, and while the Cool Jerks don't add any new twists to the modus operandi of those other units, they certainly don't detract from the legacy either. For the uninitiated, expect full-bore rock'n'roll that threatens to blow its own pistons on every straightaway. Titles like ""Let It Go And Rock!,"" ""Got Damned Again!,"" and ""Skip A Beat"" tell the story - as does the fact that three out of the thirteen songs sport exclamation marks in their titles. ""Not The Only Girl In Town"" may blatantly nick its melody line from ""Pills,"" but the Cool Jerks prove both their coolness (and jerk-dom) by using the New York Dolls version as their template. They also cover Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, lest you suspect they don't comprehend their place in the continuum. Totally cool. Here's hoping the residents of Memphis realize what greatness walks among them."
4,great book,The book I got was because my mother in law suggested it. It is a great read for anyone with marital issues.
5,This is Godly music!,"Thanks to the fine folks at Amazon.com, I will am able to listen to this album day after day. This band are my gods, whom I worship and they work for me. All the tracks are divine and the riffs and vocals, and keyboards are truly one of a kind. This is what mythical vampyric metal should be. Hail SIEBENBURGEN and amazon.com"
2,That's it? I want more for my money!!!,"I thought this video was too short and not challenging enough for my abs. I was looking for a pilates video that specifically targets the abs because that's where I want to ""feel the burn"". It didn't do a thing. It was an o.k. workout, but more for a warmup, when it suddenly ends. My first reaction was: ""I want my money back"", cause you can easily have a much better workout, and even feel it more in your abs with another pilates video that is not exclusively for the abs such as ""Breakthrou Pilates Plus"", now that's a video where you will feel your body working out. Don't bother buying ""Pilates for abs"" unless you have never done any exercise whatsover and want to start working your abs doing pilates. Still, I think there are better videos out there."
1,"Quit after 2 uses, new one wouldn't power up","Thank gawd Target has a 90-day return policy! I purchased this on sale and used it twice with great results. Yesterday I came home to a pot roast that quit cooking several hours ago... all my groceries spoiled. Today I went to Target and returned the defective unit and picked up a new one. Plugged it in and filled it with goods for split pea soup. Hit the power button... and... nothing! I'm done with this brand. Looks great, works great the two times it did its job, but the electronics are obviously NOT very durable or sophisticated. I treated this pretty unit carefully, so nothing was ever spilled on it, it never needed wiping, and was never bumped or dropped. Hope you have better luck or learn from my experience."
1,Product sucks,Used 3 times enter button doesn't work.Had to send HB $9.99 shipping fee for them to send a new one.Will never buy another Hamilton Beach or Proctor silex product again.Consumer beware.A piece of junk!!!
1,Turns itself off unexpectedly,"Disappointed. I got this as a labor saving device for our growing family. Within a few weeks of its initial purchase, it began turning itself off without warning. We carefully read the user manual to ensure this was not due to user error but it was not. Apparently others have also had this same problem. We continued to use it but had to watch it like a hawk and turn it back on (sometimes several times) when using it until it was done cooking, which is completely at odds with the ""set it and forget it"" feature of these cookers. Finally it developed some sort of electronic fault where it would turn on, but then immediately cycle off after selecting the temperature or cook mode, rendering it completely useless. I will be looking at competing manufacturers for its replacement."
3,Hamilton Beach 33966 Slow Cooker,Temperature probe seems to defeat the purpose of a slow cooker since it stops cooking when it reaches desired temp. Should be able to see temp and continue cooking.Lid is lower than other slow cooker limiting the size of items you can put in.A little pricey for what it does. Quality appears to be similar to those at half the price.
3,Just My Size Cotton Brief 5-Pk 1610C5-12-Assorted,Love the cut and the feel of the material. They are VERY comfortable. The patterns are attractive. Would buy these again.
3,"Solid colors great - prints, not so much","I've been buying JMS panties for years and years and have always loved them. The last two times, however, I discovered that the solid color panties fit perfectly, wear nicely and come out of the wash soft and comfortable. The printed panties, however, are stiff and uncomfortable. They are smaller than the solid color panties of the same size - right out of the package - and washing only makes them shrink more. I wish we would get packages of only solid colors. Only half of what I purchase is wearable."
5,deserves all the praise,"Ultralight, comfortable in the hand, and reliably accurate. What else is there to say? I use it for urban navigation, to make sure I'm walking in the right direction. It works."
4,Nice shoe,"I bought these shoes for my husband and they are wonderful. I mean, they are simple but sharp and they can really dress up an otherwise basic pair of jeans. What you see online in the picture is what you get... nothing more and nothing less so if you want them now, you'll be satisfied later."
1,SAPPY MOODSVILLE,Although not a Prestige Moodsville it sure sounds like it should be. But even then it would be a sub-standard one. 3 sappy ballads and some feeble attempts at blues playing with Jackson the last of the soloists on the longest track on which he doesn't even play the opening melody. The only decent track is the title track but you can't download it. His albums get better. This was his first.
5,Super for Beer,"This is my first review of a product. I purchased this pot with the intent to brew with it. I have to say its really a nice pot. It has a ton of head space, in fact 8g is to the lower rim and there is actually another gallon or so of head space over and above the capacity of the pot. It works great for brewing all grain batches. You can't go wrong unless you can get a converted keggle for less than $100."
2,Could have been better,This pot is sturdy but has a lot of points that it was scratched and not all one flowing piece.
4,Great pot for the price,"I use this pot to boil wort for beer making. It was about the most inexpensive stainless steel pot I could find of it's size. I wanted to be able to do full boils and this can boil 8 gallons without boiling over.The steel is a bit thin, but I expected this for a pot under $100. Although the walls are thin, I have not no issues with strength or build quality. I feel completely comfortable picking the pot up with 6 gallons of boiling liquid in it. Although heavy, the handles are up to the task and remain cool.Although there are higher quality pots out there, I don't think you can find another pot at this price at this quality level. I would recommend this pot to anyone looking for a large stock pot and a good price."
1,Leaky Handles - No Joke,"I bought this pot for home-brewing beer and can say this: When it arrived, I was filling it up one gallon at a time with water to make a measuring stick to accurately measure my gallons. All was great until I was going from 6 to 7 gallons. The water started leaking out of the poorly-constructed handles, on both sides. These are attached with poor-quality pop rivets and cannot handle the task. SO if you want a 9 gallon pot that you can only put 6 gallons of wort/water/oil/sauce in, feel free to use this one. I, however, would like to use a pot to its capacity, not 3 gallons less.I read the previous ""almost killed me"" post and figured that it was a quirk. Evidently it wasn't. Lucky for me this was just cool water with the pot sitting on my counter, not oil above a propane burner.I highly recommend going with a different product."
2,can be dangerous for a cat,"When my cat got the mice he was interested for the first 15 minutes, licked it and played with it. After that, he didn't show much interest. He plays with his 99 cents balls more than with that mice. He is generally not interested in catnip. Not all cats do.Today my cat chewed off mice tail and swallowed it. He just vomited with it. Needless to say the toy is going to garbage."
3,"Average book, missleading title.","Bought this book hoping it was a good guide to developing enterprise applications in VS.Net with UML (visio); man was I wrong. If you have the slightest idea of what UML is, and you know your way around VS.Net, go somewhere else. It just scratches the surface of a lot of things and you have probably read this somewhere else. But, the reason for the three stars is that if you are new to VS.Net, this is actually a good book. It has a lot of heuristics and guidelines for a rookie developer, on how to plan you project, protect your code and deploy your applications. Not exactly what I was looking for."
5,Huge - but nice,I read this book before taking the MSF practitioner exam and it's one of my best MSF sources. Another thing I like about the book is that this book starts where most .NET books stops; at the entrance to enterprise development. Finally a book not taking the easy way of teaching .NET development. It guides you thoroughly into the world of enterprise projects. Especially I like the way enterprise templates are described using exercises. Do get this book if you want a guide and a reference to enterprise development using .NET.
4,Not an easy install,"I purchased this ceiling fan because my current one sounded like a 747 taking off. With a .5 sone level, I thought this new fan would make a good replacement. I had no attic access and the existing cutout was only about 8x8 inches, so I cutoff enough sheetrock to fit the new housing into it. There was not enough room to install the suspension bracket that came with the unit. So be prepared to make a much larger cutout. After the unit was secured to the joists, I tested the system without attaching the ductwork. It was so quiet, that I could barely hear it.My existing duct is only 3 inches and the 3 inch adaptor came in handy. After securing the duct to the fan, the noise level increased to like a breezy sound. I figure a 4 inch duct would be better, but I don't have access. I am happy with the fan and it ventilates well. I have ordered another panasonic fan with 80 CFM for my other bathroom."
2,"Á good story, but...","I like the story in this book, but what really gets to me is that there is to much religion mixed in."
3,The Book was too slow for my liking,"Although the author does show you that when you learn to trust the Lord, he ""does"" make the crooked way straight. ""Mac"" is one of many people who has lost hope in God when tragedy strikes and you lose those you love dearly. You do lose faith in God, but He also shows his compassion to ""Mac"" and to others that his LOVE runs deeper than we realize. The Lord ""always"" brings the right people into our lives, and brings victory when hit with defeat!!"
3,Just not a good combination of mc and dj.,"Dreamweavers is composed of LRoneous on the mic and Elusive on beats. I am a huge fan of Elusive's beats, but this album does not impress me at all. There are about 3 tracks that are truly good. But even those are just good, not great. For any fan of LRoneous, I suppose this album is essential. To me, LRoneous is a mediocre MC. He has nothing unique to say, just typical hip hop jargon and a bland voice that reminds me a little of Zion I. If you love Elusive or LRoneous or both, you should own this. But don't spend too much, it's just aaaaight."
1,Beginner's level erotic mind games for undemanding tastes.,"The first of Black Lace's modern-era books I have read, this is a poor sample of erotica. What should be sensual and provocative lust-games lack conviction and depth. The dialogue and characters are predictable and shallow; little was done to improve upon the weak plot premise. I think the author may have whipped this one out to meet a deadline. Less demanding readers may still enjoy it."
2,Doesn't last,"This is made of relatively cheap plastic. Two of the 5 plastic tabs from which the housing hangs broke off when tightening the unit onto the bar, so I had to jury-rig it to keep it working. Today the motor just up and died. It lasted only two years."
1,Cominig face to face with your Inner Me,I have read many books on growing up as child of an alcoholic and the dysfunction that goes along with this chldhood trauma. Usually I can not put the books down. I found this book to be just another story of an abusive family life. It was not informative and could no keep my interest. I was very disappointed.
1,this is not a kit.,I have bought the kit before...works great. THESE ARE COLLECTION BAGS ONLY. can confuse you if you are not reading closely.
4,Amateur Journalism,"Amateur journalists originally wrote prose and poetry for ""journals"" which they set in type, printed, and exchanged with others. Lovecaft wrote his essays as Editor or Critic for an amateur journalism association in the period (1914-1925) before the printing press was supplemented and gradually replaced by other means. Still in the future were the copy machine, computer word processor, and ""Blogging,"" which combine to wheedle some amateur writers and printers away or to the production of ""e-journals"" which are not yet fully accepted. His essays as Amateur Journalism Critic will be of interest to historians, current amateur journalists (Association names are on the Web), and Lovecraft aficionados) Lovecraft essays on other topics are in four volumes by the same publsher."
4,new candiria album,"candiria are truly an original band. a mixture of jazz, hip hop, and metal, fused together in a very impressive manner. . im almost tempted to say they are on the verge of genius. i was very very stoked to see the new record out. i found '300% density' to be very inspiring last year. completely kicked my ass. as far out as last years record was, this one is even more so. not a bad thing. this is hardcore street fusion, totally hypnotizing.its also a 2 disc set. the first disc is candiria kicking ass as usual. the second disc though, is a mixture of off the wall, more subtle tunes featuring artist im not familiar with. im actually spinning it right now. its pretty unique.any fan of metal, hip hop, jazz, or just someone looking for something different should seriously consider shelling out for this album. this may be the future."
4,a goooooood cd,"a great cd of the most important backinvockals of guns n roses, in guns last cd (spaghetti incident?) he sing 6 or more song, he's a very good singer, if you like guns you better buy this fantastic cd."
4,Good Tips for the money,"For the price u paid, u could definitely get good tips from it! The math section is quite useful too. I think more practice questions are needed to illustrate how the tips work. But, for the price u pay, it certainly meets my expectation!"
5,This is the best comic book ever,i love this comic book the human torch rocks the designs rock it is awsome with a little bit of humor overall i think this is the best comic book ever i recomend it to any comic book lover
3,"I like it, but not my cats","I had hoped to provide my two cats with a new play toy. I liked the idea that you could open the toy up and refresh the catnip. Well, they loved the catnip that came with it, but so far, have no interest in the duck. This was one of those times I thought a toy was cute, but not my cats. I'm still hoping that the catnip inside the toy will get their attention and they'll have some fun with it."
3,misleading product name,"The HCM 635 QUIET CARE is very noisey even on the slowest speed. It was bought to be used in a bedroom for a elderly sick person. I""m in the process of buying something else but realize now that I can not trust a purchase over the internet and need to do some local leg work to find what I need. I'm informed by friends that they are available (quiet humidifiers)."
1,Hmmmm,Phil Sheridan was a sociopath who wanted to murder the battered remnants of Lee's army just before the surrender. His bloodlust was later satisfied when he was turned loose on the American Indian. Pure genocide. I'm not sure we have ever produced uglier little man in our 400 years in this hemisphere.
4,Works fine,"Works as expected. No problem with range on either phone. Has several features(memory, etc) that I have not bothered to use. Clarity of sound OK. ONLY PROBLEM I had is that received from seller NOT NEW. Was not packed like a new phone but just stuck in box(like returned to Walmart/Target) and this was a reseller item SOLD AS NEW. I kept since was exactly what I wanted and was having trouble finding this model in White."
5,Great Varitey...,"This is a great cardio workout providing both variety and effectiveness. She is a good instructor, though her voice is a little harsh sounding as if she needs to clear her throat. Nevertheless, she is clear and concise in her cues. The instructor also incorporates power bursts that really get your heart rate even higher and provide interval training. Fun and somewhat challenging....a great buy."
4,One of my favorites,"I LOVE Crunch DVDs. This one is one of my favorites too.I do many forms of workouts (I am a plus sized FIT woman), including mountain biking, Tae-Bo, and hardcore hiking/bushwacking (lol). I find that this video gets my heart rate up, and is a fun way to burn some calories.I haven't worked out in quite a long time, so I put this video in because I knew it would be a great way to get back into the swing of things.I highly recommend this video for beginners of all shapes and sizes.I also enjoyed Lizbeth's instruction. I have yet to see a Crunch instructor I don't like (Ellen Barrett being my favorite).Definitely worth the money."
4,Very motivational,"Lizbeth Garcia (the instructor) is great because she does a move several time before she includes it. It is a 30 minute cardio with a good warmup and cool down. Even if I don't do the full routine I still get good results except for the arm work which isn't challenging at all. I like the variety and I haven't got bored. I have lost 20lbs since 01/07. There is a lady in the video that is so thin that you can easily see her ribs. If the camera adds weight then this poor woman must be in bad shape. I emailed the production crew and didn't get much of a response. Other then this, I highly recommend it!"
4,Works great,"Actually a bit larger than I needed, but the size will work. It holds six SD cards and and now that they are so cheap I only have two. But it is padded and will keep them safe and protected."
4,Great little timer,"This is a clean, simple to use unit for saving power. The instructions are easy to understand for the operation and installation including wiring it up. Only real question deals with interior and exterior installation, paperwork doesn't say nor does the switch description in sales material. I put it outside in a protected area but a storm will blow rain on it. The battery holds the program and clock during power outages. Bottom line, very pleased so far"
1,not reliable,"This was installed to control electrical usage for a solar hot water system, very good in theory but the the ""professionals"" who installed it put it in an inaccessible location in a vacation rental home. If the weather is cloudy you need to be able to override it or no hot water. Likewise you need to be able to replace the battery easily or when the power goes out it cannot keep time.The LCD burned out after a year so it cannot be monitored or programmed.If you use one for solar hot water control be sure it is easy to get at and people know how to use it, otherwise it is useless.Plan on replacing the entire unit frequently.BTW: The mechanical clock ones are more reliable but they need to be adjusted whenever power goes out!"
2,Engineering Issues,"The timer is easy to install, but has an issue with some heater elements.If your heater element creates a lot of electrical ""noise"", the timer may reset or stop working all together.Calling Intermatic support will get you a set of filters that you will need to install, butfor our installation, did not help and still causes the timer to malfunction causingyou to take some cold showers..."
2,Meditation???????,"I bought this cd because of the 5 star reviews it received (I'm a huge fan of the reviews on Amazon). I really wanted a quiet, inspirational cd to help quiet my mind before God. The title of this cd led me to believe that the music would be conducive to meditation. It was loud at times, and fast. Not that I'm anti-rock or anti-jazz or any such thing, but ""Instrumental Meditation"" to me means a harp, an acoustic guitar, or maybe a piano or a flute. It didn't even occur to me that it might be a synthesizer and a drum machine, along with an electric guitar and a soprano sax.Aside from the ""meditation"" business, there were some parts of the cd that I thought were very good, musically speaking. But most were just mediocre. I was very disappointed. Anyone know any good harp cd's????"
4,Liked the first half more than second,"And the sad story of Handy Campbell was well done even with Rubin getting a little melodramatic with his personal feelings at times.Rubin claims Handy was discriminated against by the coaches because he was black but the more you read about Handy the more you come to see just how dumb (across the board) he was.No Epilogue. No Pictures. I can't even find any pics on the internet. Except for possibly Lanardo Myrick at www.klmenter.com/page2.htmlIt's about the south, race, football, murder, and two lost souls. Recommended."
2,Ignore the product description,"""Mizuno's soft thick terry construction absorbs perspiration and keeps bands dry with comfort""This is not the product that arrived. These wrist bands are thin and not something I want to use to wipe the sweat off my brow. They are more like a 5 inch compression wrap (think ankle/elbow brace material)."
2,Not Your Typical Wrist Band,These are not the type of wrist bands that you would use to wipe your brow. They are very thin spandex type of wrist bands that resemble something you would wear on your ankle or elbow for support. I'm sure they have value to someone but not for me.
2,poor design,"I was very disappointed by the design of this product. The Logo is sewn on in such a way as to stretch the band out of shape so that it doesn't fit around my wrist at all. It just sticks up in the air and doesn't bend or flex. Really poor design or poor quality control, for it looks nothing like the picture ! :"
4,Anouk,"I heard Anouk first while watching ""So You Think You Can Dance"". ""Lost"" was the song and I enjoyed the sound of it so much that I checked out Amazon for more of her music. I now have two CDs by her and have listened to both of them over and over. I like the unique sound of her voice and I enjoy her music which tells stories that connect for me. I like this CD quite a lot. However, in contrast to other reviewers, I prefer her ""Lost Tracks"" CD. Maybe because the music was done earlier and doesn't have quite so much of a polished edge. It sounds slightly rawer than Hotel New York. As a result, for me the music sounds a little edgier and a little newer. Nevertheless, I shouldn't like to be without either of these CDs and if you are a fan of Anouk, you certainly won't be disappointed by either album."
1,Anouk-Hotel New York,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! The only track worth listening to is ""Lost"". The rest is trash!"
2,Shabby quality,These jewel cases are a disappointment. Three of them have coma apart at the hinge. The hinge is very small and weak and just breaks even if you are careful while opening/closing. Would not recommend.
2,you get what you pay for,Arrived on time. I like the double cd pack. Unfortunalty some of the cases were broken when I got them and they brake easily when opening.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED,"THE CASES GET THE JOB DONE, BUT ARE NOT THAT DURABLE. I MISS THE MEANS TO DISPLAY THE CONTENTS OF THE DISC. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING AS THICK AS A STANDARD JEWEL CASE WITH A SIDE DISPLAY THAT HOLDS TWO DISCS"
4,Good enough,"I can use these, but wish they were made so the dvd titles would show without me having to open the case. I guess I can tape a title to them and make them work okay. They serve their purpose, and seem to be made well enough to hold up to the use I will put them through. I like them better than the doubles that I got that are taller and black, those, as well, have to be opened to see what is inside. Between the two choices, I would choose these until I find something that meets my purposes better."
4,Chairman of the Board,"Count Basie and his band with music from their years of playing on the Sinatra Show back in the 60's. Sinatra does not sing with them, these are instrumentals, but it is Basie all the way. A good album for those who love Basie's style."
3,I gotta disagree with the other reviews!,This book is more of a history lesson and not much of an instruction book. Mostly sketches instead of photos when describing the techniques.You would be better off spening your money on the following books:Complete Krav Maga: The Ultimate Guide to Over 200 Self-Defense and Combative TechniquesKrav Maga: How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Assault
4,like it so much I owned it twice,"I wish all techniques had pics, the krav system names things different than most. I own the advanced version also. its a good system David knows what he is writing about."
1,Don't buy this book,"When I told my KM instructor that I read this book he told me that this guy doesn't know what the heck he's talking about. In the back of the book it says that he's not afilliated or approved by the KM association. And for good reason. The guy only took a few KM classes in Israel and now thinks he is an authority on writing a KM book. Although it's greatly written, I wouldn't recommend buying this unapproved product, written by some nobody. If you want something solid, get the 5 DVD set by Levine, which comes from the KM association. Sure you might spend a little more, but you won't have to try to dissect complicated moves with a few cartoon figures and written language, plus you get something genuine."
4,Good source of insight into Krav Maga.,"This book is a valuable insight into Krav Maga. I thought it was well written and considerably informative. Although the technique section wasn't very helpful because it is hard to get an idea on how a technique is carried out by looking at a small drawing of a person using arrows to show direction. If you want to learn about origins and history of Krav Maga then this book is what you want. But if technique instruction is what your looking for then I recommend the DVD set, or even better join a class."
1,Pure Junk - Beware!,"I bought this device thinking it would be useful. It wasn't even that; in fact it even damaged the spark plug threads in the cylinder head of my motorcycle.The Colortune was screwed in by hand fully and then tightened according to instructions. When I tried to remove the Colortune, it was seized in place. I waited for things to cool and then carefully unscrewed the Colortune using a spray lubricant to help. A few of the internal spark plug threads had been damaged due to galling.I measured the major diameter of the Colortune at work (I work in a lab) and it did not meet spark plug dimensioning, either SAE or British in the Machinery Handbook. In fact, the major diameter of the Colortune threads was 0.008 inches larger than a Bosch or NGK spark plug. 0.008 inches is substantial!!!I did get a refund, but no compensation from Gunson for damages. Their response in a letter to me proved their arrogance. I should have known better; look where it is made."
2,Didn't fit,"Didn't fit my older Bronco, now you must buy an adaptor. Wasn't impressed with the manufacturing of this product. Pretty expensive for plastic."
4,The Cosby show,Bought the CD's for a friend who was excited when I delivered to him. I really have no compliants so far on the procedure for the purchase. It was delivered as scheduled in the tracking system. It couldn't have been better.
4,Soulful Serenade!!,"Ok, I liked this story. Brandon has got to be the sweetest romancer that I have read about. Talk about a brother that likes to spoil his woman. Granted Brandon had his problems, he still was an okay guy! Hah, he knows how to treat his woman! This is truly a nice read."
2,Putting words in MY mouth? C'mon now . . .,"This book is more than a bit superficial, and anyone who uses these ""answers"" can be spotted a mile off by professional interviewers. Read Martin's other advice, but pass on his answers. Your answers need to come from the real you -- which is likely to be a far more successful approach than putting someone else's words into your mouth. That's as dangerous an idea as I've ever heard for an interview . . ."
1,This recycling is getting tiresome,"Let's start this off by saying that I have always been a fan of Dilbert and it is one of the few comic strips I'll buy in collected form. That being said, the constant recycling of of material has hit a new low with this collection. Once again using previously collected material from 1989-2001, this collection does not even give the reader accompanying text from Adams, just a short intro that adds nothing to the reader's enjoyment. Are the ""cubical sociopaths"" separated from one another by anything other than chronological order? No! If you are a Dilbert fan and own the other collections, save your money. It's almost like this one was designed by the marketing department and put together at the last minute by Wally."
4,Laugh at your Co-Workers,"In today's bleak economic climate, we need laughs to get through the day. This book had me laughing a lot even though I currently have nightmares about my job! The collection is put together shoddily however, as several strips appear in this book on more than one page!This is not the best Dilbert book, but it was a pleasant diversion from reality, and let me laugh at my boss without my boss knowing it."
4,A Review by a Fan,"Although this book has its faults (at least one of the strips is in it twice), it's another welcome compendium of Scott Adams' Dilbert cartoon strips. Anybody who has spent much time in an office setting will find much to identify with. A very enjoyable hour or two of reading!"
1,Collection of some of the previous strips from Dilbert books,Marketing prank again by Scott Adams compiling some of the previous strips into another book. Do not buy the book and get fooled. Sounds to me like slapped together book that was released last year. Runs strips from 1992 to 2001.
5,Superior product,I have used the Classic Laid for my appraisal reports for over 20 years. Very hard to find outside of metropolitan areas. Thank you for a great product. Go Baronial Ivory!
4,recommended,Nice novel-had a satisfying feel at the end. I liked that the main character cobbled together a living. Lots of people put together a life in odd or disparate ways but you don't often find them in novels. I found this novel a convincing evocation of a certain kind of urban life.
3,Quite Effective 80's Shocker,"A witch comes back for revenge in this tale which although is no masterpiece, it does have a few scenes to make you jump. Good to see Larry Pennell (alias Dash Riprock from The Beverly Hillbillies) too."
1,How bad can you get?,"I remember going to see this movie with a group of 8 friends growing up, there were several other people in the theatre for about a grand total of 30 people. At the end of the movie I looked around and noticed I was the only one left in the theatre. This movie was terrible, I only stayed till the end hoping it would get better. The sound was off and this is terribly annoying when people's mouths aren't moving to the right words. The movie was predictable which I could have gotten past if the acting wasn't so bad."
4,Finally?,"I first saw this film over twenty years ago in a revival theatre and have longed for the day when it was more widely available. Now, it looks as if it will finally be here.Although the ending a a little weak, ""The Gang's All Here"" was a wonderful vehicle for Busby Berkley's first musical. You've got Alice Faye as the singer who's in love in a solider (it is WWII, after all) and a terrific supporting cast with Carmen Miranda, Edward Everett Horton, and Benny Goodman and his orchestra. This is the film with Carmen's classic ""Lady and the Tutti-Frutti Hat"" number, complete with phallic bananas manipulated by the chorus girls, but there are also some marvelous Alice Faye numbers, especially her ""No Love, No Nothing"" sung all alone on a simple apartment set, echoing the sentiments of many women who kept the home fires burning while their men were off saving the world for democracy."
5,Fantastic color and sound,Do not listen to the reviews about poor transfer. I have a couple vhs copies from the 1980's and 1990's and also the laser disc. This is as good as the disc and much better than the vhs. I did not have to adjust anything on my t.v. and had goose bumps looking at all the gorgeous color and listening to the wonderful songs. BUY IT!!!!!!!!
3,Ronald McDonald: Evil Clown of the New World Order,"McLibel documents the civil trial of two activists in England who were sued by McDonalds for giving out flyers (that they were not even the authors of) outside a McDonalds in London. Instead of cowering down and shutting up they decided to fight a multimillion dollar corporate legal machine. Besides covering the trial proceedings it goes over much of the dirty tactics that were used against the two activists, including sending undercover operatives into their group and following them everywhere they went. So McDonalds is not just a typical unethical corporation, they actually go so far as to be an Orwellian enemy of free speech. McLibel also goes over the truth that was included in the flyer in question. Health destroying food, worker exploitation, environment destruction and pollution, helping to destroy and homogenize cultures, etc."
2,missing,"I purchased this water pump specifically because it came with the gasket. The order came promptly but guess what, no gasket. I hope I can find one locally with out too much trouble so I can get this pump changed this weekend."
5,KEEP THIS ONE -- IT IS A WINNER,All I can add is that no one can put this story down! And believe it or not the cover matches the story [wouold definitely like to know who the model is] -- especially our hero! Cain MacCallister and Maggie Cortland MacCallister really tugged at the heartstrings - And I love Ms Ankrum giving us a lady that can love strongly enough to let go and still hope for a future and faith enough to let it work out..[although - grin - I don't know how a gelding can become a stallion - except in words]I must join the others in saying this is a keeper and recommend it highly.
2,Expected a lot more,I received a recommendation to buy this cd so I searced for it no matter the price.Her voice is very good but thats all.It lacks a lot of musicalization and musical richness.Wish I could have back at least $10 for it.
2,Fun?,"Picture quality stinks. It's no better than one of those old instant cameras!The advantage to this camera, and it is the ONLY advantage, is that it's cheap. Ok, it's also easy to use.I recommend a mega-pixel camera, 2.0 or more, if you want to take good pictures. Buy this Polaroid only if you're looking for an inexpensive way to take photos and send them via email."
3,"On a sunny day, with a steady hand~good enough for the price",I wanted an [inexpensive] way to take digital pics ~ after testing under a number of conditions...The only acceptable pictures were taken outdoors in bright light with the subject 5-25 feet... greater distances (scenery) were low in detail... and a steady hand is necessary... the nicest things is the self timer ~ my niece used at cheerleading camp and was able to set it on a picnic table top & set the timer so everyone could be in the picture (about 10 feel away) & they turned out cute! Otherwise the kids took a few ok pictures ~ but most were blurred ~ you REALLY need a steady hand...
3,good starter digital,"This digital takes decent pictures and even without the use of a memory card holds more than the usual digital does. My only problem is that it is not compatible with my new Windows XP...so if you don't have that version of windows you'll be fine...it's like having an easy, regular camera, but you don't have to buy film or pay for developing!"
5,I want to channel the spirits of dead indians too,"Awesome album, dark but with just the right amount of screw you which makes it a great match for people that like some of the later Black Flag albums (like myself).Good sound, strong bass lines and perfect deep gravely vocals. Gets my blood flowing all the time. I think I'll be attending any Los Olivados shows in hopes that they play any Injvns songs."
1,"dude, this sucks...big time","why the hell did they release a cd. It has Bowling for soup which is so dumb. Plus, the music is just as bad as the show. Its crappy 60's music. If u want good music, go check out Slipknot, Korn, mudvayne,even the sucky bands like even greenday and my chemical romance are better than this well worthy hunk of sh**!Ok. Its not that bad, Oh wait! Yes it is! go buy a barney cd that is better than this! just buy a 60s music cd. Cause this is the worst idea that jacka** klasky csupo has come up with since the wild thorn berries!"
1,He Repeats Himself,"This book was disappointing. Not a lot of new information about the DM, Zero-Point field, God, whatever. But what really felt like a gyp was that the personal stories are the same stories he keeps telling over and over again. I already read them in other books of his, and since he spends so much time telling them again, I feel like the price of the book was too much. When I buy a new book by someone, I expect new information. And he does takes way too long to make a point and relate an experience. I feel like he's got a page count he needs to reach and he'll through in any old fodder to get there. Very disappointing, Greg. You can do better."
4,The hologram is a fine analogy,"I read this book as an avid student of holograms and was quite taken by the idea of us as holographic images. But I could not rid myself of the fact that the hologram is a projection of an image, not the subject of the image any more than is the person in a photograph. To me the true subject is captured in the wavefront. The wave front is the sum of experience, and it is in virtually constant processes of change. Any discrete image from the wavefront is likely to be similar to any other, but in its nature, never the same. That is the divinity of the matrix. We are all parts of it, but each is a discrete moment in the pattern of the wavefront. Arriving at that made the book a compelling read."
4,Deja vu !,"Well written, and interesting, but reminds me of ""The Thoughtron Theory of Life and Matter"" by Harold McGowan (no longer available), which I read some years back, wherein the premise is that ones ""thoughts"" are that which creates. Essentially this is what the Divine Matrix is all about, not especially a revelation, however, at this time it seems that real science is inching closer to suggesting this as a possibility. I've been an advocate for some time now, and I'm glad the rest of the world is finally catching up."
5,Inspirational,"Brilliant book - clearly written - discusses and illustrates who we, the world and universe really are, how the matrix works, and how we can ""use"" it for the positive advancement of ourselves, others and the world at large. I'm recommending it to all my friends!"
2,Mediocre to below average book,I bought the book for a reference and it seems to me to be lacking in that area so I would rate it below average for a reference. The tutorial section is fair but also somewhat incomplete. Overall I was disappointed. I would actually rate it more like 2.5 stars (not that it matters much). The book is not totally useless but there have to be better books than this out there.
1,Applejack,This is NOT like the Applejack from years ago. The potpourri pieces are HUGE and the smell is very faint.
4,Great first album,"This is a great CD. It is first album by a really good Canadian Blues composer, pianist and singer. Dan wrote all the songs on this album. His gravelly voice is perfect for the songs and the songs are perfect for his voice and delivery. I enjoy this CD over & over. It makes me smile. Especially, ""Honey Bee""! Awaiting the next album!"
2,Spoiled brat.,"This book's Amazon page has an editoral review. I tried to like this book, but it was just annoying at times. It reminded me of another story like this, but the therapist had been abused and didn't like to be touched--I can't remember the author though. This guy, Symon was a whining, spoiled brat and Pamela is just too perky. One of first things she does it put him on a low-fat diet--that annoyed me right off. He's lost weight and she decides the first battle in his physical therapy treatment is going to be his diet! Why not get him interested in his treatment and then worry about his food. Doesn't anyone eat real food any more? Why is low-fat fiber filled food supposed to save the world."
2,Nazi metaphors galore,While the writing is ok the book is an allegory for the nazis roundup of Jews and subsequent mass murder. Weird topic for kids book
1,Not like razorback used to be,"I have bought razorback round point digging shovels only for the last 20 years. After my son broke the last shovel handle (misuse), I bought a new razorback long handle round tip shovel. What a disappointment. I don't even have all the label worn off and the handle is looser than the 20 year old shovel that has a lot of the metal tip worn away. Who still makes a shovel for heavy use and not digging up flowers? Don't take the login name wrong - I am using my wifes amazon account."
1,"Looks nice, but STIN-KY!!","The mats have this strange rubber/petroleum smell. I feel like I'm choking on the smell as I drive. It's even on my clothes! MAYBE it'll fade with time (I just bought them), but I don't want to risk it so I'll probably try to get a refund... Too bad - they look really nice!"
4,A change and something more!,"I was really impressed with the album and I think that Gary should be commended for doing it, it is refreshing and different and I personally feel that it is just what he needed to do, to step out and really explore his talent and capabilities, he has now proved that he can do more then just gospel and do it well to, so I say good for Gary keep it up."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. I HAVE PURCHASED 2 OF GARY OLIVERS PRIOR CDS AND LOVE THEM. I WAS SURE THIS CD WOULD BE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM BUT I WAS SO WRONG. THE OVERRALL CD SEEMS TO HAVE A R&B THEME RATHER THAN GIVING REVERANCE TO GOD. I BELIEVE THAT GARY OLIVER COULD HAVE DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB.
3,Fair to middling,"This is my second attempt to stomach a Lori Foster effort (see my other review about Foster's Too Much Temptation). I have come to the conclusion that I am a bird person and she is a fish person and we just can't work together. I found the beginning of this story to drag on, so I skipped to the middle. The pace picked up, but it didn't help the story, which is awash in mediocrity. I don't recommend not purchasing this book; however, I won't be spending any more money to read Lori Foster's work."
3,Good suction for its size; short run time,"This hand vacuum has considerably stronger suction than other models I've tried in the past. It works well for spills and other small cleanup jobs, and is useful in tight areas such as automobiles. The downside is that the battery run-time is short; after less than 10 minutes the motor starts to slow down. The Nickel-Cadmium battery used in this model is cheaper than the Lithium-ion batteries used in more expensive products; it is susceptible to the ""memory effect"", whereby the run-time length decreases if charging occurs without first completely discharging the battery. As a result, it is advisable to run the vacuum down (until it stops) as often as is practical. Since the device is rather noisy, this is unfortunate."
5,Excellent Hose,I bought two of these over 20 years ago when they came in 75 foot lengths and they are still going strong. They stay outside in the weather 365 days a year in the Florida sun and have even seen some below freezing temperatures. I had to replace the brass male coupler on the end of one of the hoses but that has been it. The hose does kink if your not careful but it is extreemly durable and stays very flexable even in temperatures below 40 degrees. I highly recommend this hose to anyone who doesn't want to have to purchase a new garden hose every few years.
2,Verified purchaser of this hose...,"I talked my boss into buying this hose, because it was rated for hot water usage. Well, the hose worked great right out of the box, and I thought all our hot water hose woes were behind us. This particular hose lasted us a grand total of two weeks +/- a day or two.I work in a restaurant setting, so we need a hose that can handle hot water... very hot water. I still haven't found one that can hold up, though this one was one of the best. Any hose that relies on glue to keep things together should not be rated for hot water usage, plain and simple. Eventually, the seal will melt and things will get very wet in places where it shouldn't!Back to the ol' drawing board...!"
3,Soft,"It's a nice hose for the money, but when I was hooking it up it seemed soft and I hadn't even run hot water through it yet. Seems that it might kink easely."
5,Spellbound,"I was spellbounded throughtout the reading of this book. I felt each character evolve. I could see their faces and read their minds. It was as if I was right there, a silent character.As an African American who is Baptist, I know this story well. Ms. Michael's account corresponds with my personal experiences. Her wonderful way of writing has me anxiously anticipating the sequel to this book."
4,"Still FLC, still good","The Fun Lovin Criminals are a unique band. They mix so many styles (rap, lounge, rock, even country) and pull it off great. There are not many bands in today's era that hit me like they do. Unfortunately, if it wasn't for the internet, I would've never found them. Believe me when I say they are 100% original and a blessing in the world of music that exists today.Anyways, this is a good album but if you're new to FLC I'd start with Come Find Yourself, 100% Colombian, or Loco. Don't start with this or Mimosa."
1,Quite a bore...,"This book was not as outstanding as I had thought it would be. Very difficult to follow, jumps from dates back and forth. The style of writing was definitely not one that I prefer. The facts were all there, but could have easily done without the debate of personal opinion. Point: Not impressed at all...not a good read."
3,Took forever to receive...,"The book was exactly what I ordered, however it took almost four weeks to get my item. It was supposed to be a gift for a friends little boy, but the party was way past by the time I received my order. What a waste of money and time."
4,"Emotional, tender","Though I found the plot predictable, I became very involved with the main characters, Maura and Quinn. I am always interested in the developing relationships of a couple, how they got to be as they are and how they can become more together. I found this book to be right on in this area. I especially liked how the townspeople came together to aid Quinn and how Quinn finally accepted their friendship. Kudos to Ms. Gregory."
5,Eye Opener !,"Wow! I just finished reading Passenger's Side. I have never experienced anything like this. In fact, the very reading of this book was an experience. I've generally found that many Christian books sort of beat you up, and others just come across like a long and boring sermon. Not this one. This book is extremely down to earth, and very practical. I learned things that I simply didn't know. I never really thought that a relationship with Christ could actually be exciting. This book showed me that it can be just that. It also taught me a lot about love, and too many other things to even list. While the Joel Osteen book that I recently read was excellent, this one is just amazing! Everyone should read this book !"
1,Not Quite Right,"I am giving this book 1 star because the author does emphasis the importance of salvation through Christ. But that is where the stars stop. This book is typical of the 'name it and claim it' view of the bible and of God. Instead, read Believing God by Beth Moore."
2,I RETURNED IT,"I'm happy for you, John, that you have found Christ. You get an extra star for that, so two total. Unfortunately you have absolutely nothing new to say to anyone else. I read the entire book, but I must say, I almost quit when you spoke about the ""miracle"" of the increased amount of milk in your cereal bowl. Your book is in dire need of a good editor. I've never seen so many unneeded commas and so many omitted apostrophes. Guess that's pretty common with self-published books. I wish you the best. Hope you aren't relying on sales from this book to replace the income from the job you quit."
2,NOISY!!,I didn't enjoy this product at all. The motor was HORRIBLY loud and frankly didn't move enough (very big head that essentially stays still while the rest moves because the motor is not stronge enough). The only good thing about this product is the attachment: it has a seperate control so you are able to use it without turning on the other. I would not recommend.
4,About as epic as it gets.,"Really, I think the title of this review says it all. Summoning's music is an experience that can't be described, you have to hear it to understand what makes it so special. Playing this album can make even the most mundane activities feel like an epic adventure! Just listen to ""Farewell"" while heading home after work, and you'll know what I mean. Pick up this and ""Dol Guldor""."
1,"Union Floral Shovel, 8 1/4"" x 6""","Well, I ordered this item on 6/2/11 and today it's 6/13/11.Today I received an email from Amazon saying I wouldn't be getting my purchase (shovel). The stated reason being the item was undeliverable? I have no idea what that means and no effort was made to explain it to me what happened. I was unable to find a way to get a human response as to my inquiry, but I will be getting a refund on my credit card so I can't complain. The shovel was to be a gift to my Mother, so obviously I am very disappointed."
3,Needs Some Editing But Otherwise a Good Read,"SO WILD A DREAM has some shining moments as the characters travel across the Great Plains, through Mormon country, and on to the gold fields of Virginia City. Would you imagine a half-breed young man, a Tibetan nun, and an English gentleman grouping up and encountering such real life people as Brigham Young and Samuel Clemens? The plot is interesting and fast moving, but the long interludes of philosophy are tedious. I picked this up because I enjoyed Win Blevins' GIVE YOUR HEART TO THE HAWKS -- a tribute to the mountain men -- and hoped SO WILD A DREAM WOULD pick up that thread. However, it didn't."
3,Satisfactory Book,I had to get this book for a class - so it wasn't for casual reading. It seems to be written more like a book instead of just chapters of papers and essays that professionals wrote.
4,so far so good,this camera is ok so far cant complain. still learning how 2 use it other than that if works ok for my first camera.
2,Answers seem to lack sometimes,Often found myself asking why they used a certain equation over another. Taught one equation and the book tells you to use another. Kind of annoying and the answers don't go too much into why.
4,MCAT-Physics,It's a good tool because it gives you a lot of practice. Only downside is some of the explanations in the back aren't effecient.
2,a credibility problem,"My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for ""after"" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks."
1,Some Good Advice/Some Bad Advice,"It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers, breathe and think positive healing thoughts. But that's the extent of his good advice. He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out. ""The Whole Soy Story"" by Kaayla Daniel and ""The Fluoride Deception"" by Chris Bryson. Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health."
3,Not bad,"Weil outlines a fairly easy program to improve your health. It's nothing earth shattering, and involves moderate exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, and taking antioxidants. Being a physician I would have liked some well done scientific research showing that these things are effective, rather than being asked to take them at face value, but there's nothing far fetched about diet, exercise, meditation etc. He does get a little carried away talking about pesticides in food, the dangers of sleeping with a clock radio on your night stand etc, but I'm willing to overlook that stuff. I think for anyone who doesn't do the things he speaks of, this gradual program could get them doing a lot of it. Of course, it still remains to be seen whether this will improve my health over the long term, and, of course, we won't really ever know, but the program is easy enough that if it doesn't help me not much will have been lost."
5,Excellent! Concise & current resource for parents of teens,Very supportive & realistic. Easy to read. Helpful. Gives a parent an understanding of what the teen is thinking & feeling. Has practical & positive ideas/recommendations for challenging issues. Offers MANY tips for guiding your adolescent into a healthy & content adulthood.
3,Nothing special...,"First disappointment is that the El-P track is an instrumental. I was hoping for vocals - bummer (hadn't read the review before I bought-oops!). The rest of the album failed to really hold my attention, with the exception of the Steinski track, which was fresh as hell, and the closer by Chief Xcel - very nice dynamic shifts. The other big disappointment was the Freestyle Fellowship track - decidedly uninspired rhyming from Aceyalone, which is most out of character. Not the high level we've come to expect.In conclusion, this album feels like a compilation of throwaway tracks that the artists didn't feel were good enough to make it on their own releases. Unless you are insane backpacker-obsessive, your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Worst bike gears ever!,"So not only do the gears not shift most of the time, but the actual little things (I don't know what to call them) that are on the handle bars which allow you to change the gears, are the worst quality ever! You can't just click it from one gear to the next...instead, you have to move it and it clicks repeatedly and you have to guess when it's at the right spot to change the gear. I couldn't get it to even do anything while I was riding it though, it was like riding a cruiser bike...up a large hill. DO NOT BUY IT! Also, the brakes were all screwed up and the instructions don't tell you how to FIX them, because they expect them to be perfectly fine. I'm afraid to ride this bike, honestly. I wish I could send it back and get my money back!!!"
2,bright wheels,"The bike rides well with the suspension, but the tire rims are a bright green, which is embarassing, makes me feel dorky."
1,AVOID THIS!!!,After buying this cd I found out that there was another version of the same name out!! A much better version I might add!! This song is a poor attempt at a remake!! If your looking for THE BEST remake of the song HEAVEN check out ...... DJ Sammy & Yanou - Heaven ......DO NOT PURCHACE THIS BEFORE LISTENING TO THE DJ SAMMY VERSION AS YOU WILL REGRET NOT GETTING THAT ONE INSTEAD!!!! I Did!
3,IF $60.00 isn't anything to you.....,"This is a nice DVD to watch for the scenery, music, philosophy of the monds, etc. Only the 2nd part of the 2nd DVD covers actual dog training in some detail. I personally love German Shepherds and there are a lot of them in this DVD and this is the ONLY reason I don't regret buying this DVD.If you want a detailed and practical ""how to"" DVD then purchase: Your Puppy 8 weeks to 8 Months. I hope this helps anyone."
2,You get what you pay for,"I used this for about 2 months then it broke completely. Wont charge any batteries at all.. What can I say, you get what you pay for, now I learned to get name brand stuff LOL"
4,This is a good workout for people who need to start up working out again,"This one was good and I actually enjoyed it. Its motivating and fun and it teaches you a new method of working out. It's not for pros (hence the name for dummies you guys), its for people starting out like me. So, if you want to start up again after leaving working out for a while this is great for you. It's also great for providing a good wholesome workout.It's nice to learn this new sport, admittedly somewhat a limited education, and its great to take out some of your aggression! Overall a good buy."
4,Actually...A Pretty Good Read!,"Having just finished the Xibalba Murders, I have to say I was impressed. Not so much by the authenticity of the locales and archaeology, but by the quality of the story. And despite some of the negative reviews, I found the Xibalba Murders a good and satisfying mystery, in the Tony Hillerman sort of way.Without a doubt, Lyn Hamilton does a superb job with her descriptions and feel of Chichen Itza. Although it's been a quite a few years since I've been there, and I have long lost contact with my traveling companions, Cecilia and Irma, it's a place you can never forget. Reading this story made me feel like I had returned. Even Lyn's description of the kindly professor, Dr. Hernan Castillo, was suspiously like a certain professor we encountered at the ruins that just happened to be from Merida.One thing's for sure...Lyn Hamilton knows her people and knows her places. And she also knows how to write!"
4,lavendar bags,"I purchased these lavendar dryer bags online at Amazon because Trader Joe's discontinued selling them. I have hoped that they would add them back to their assortment, but glad that I have a resource for them online. They are perfect for drying sheets and pillow cases."
1,A Let Down,"I was happy to have found these after finding out they were discontinued at the store I had been buying them. However, I've used one of these 4-packs, and of the 4, three of them have lost their seal and I've had to pick lavender out of the laundry and the lint-catcher.What a let-down. There has to be something better than this out there."
1,Not SlimGuide,"The one they sent me wasn't SlimGuide...Yet it works properly, it isn't within the parameters of the researches on favor of this particular brand."
1,Do not judge a book by it's cover.,"I was very disappointed when I got ""Where Will This Shoe Take You? : A Walk Through the History of Footwear."" I expected color pictures of shoes from every era, not classified by shoe style. Also, I expected more pictures of people wearing the shoes featured in this book, as there were few pictures. I do not recommend."
3,Run Big,"I bought a few of these Izod shirts as a gift. These shirts run big, so if you're a medium, I suggest purchasing a small. I had to return 3 shirts since they don't seen to be true to size. The company was very helpful with the return and keep me updated every step of the way. Other than that, these are nice shirts for casual wear."
1,Not just inexpensive but CHEEP and a waste of money!! Stay clear of this one!,"I purchased this for my son. I wasnt expecting G&G; quality like my G&G; M16 but hoped to get a few yard battles out of it. We fired maybe 12 rounds and the magazine broke. The charger led slowly fades out in 10 to 15 minutes. If you dont uses EXTREAME caution when pulling the stock back the slides will come apart. Luckly they go back together easily enough. Mind you as of this writing, the gun has not been out of the package for more than 3 hours and has not been rough handled or played with other than test firing. As I said, I didnt expect much for this price but it's not even a good toy gun. I hope I can make the part the magazine needs or I will have a dissapointed son.Before my purchase, I emailed Airspat 2 times about a fair inexpensive gun, one time including this product. They never gave me any real answers or recomendation. I will not purchase from them again."
1,Broke the second day,"We have 10 airsoft and airsplat guns and this one is a piece! This thing is very cheap quality. It broke the second day we used it. The BB's were not entering the chamber correctly, the auto/semi auto switch broke and the gears in the electric motor jammed. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Concise information,"Mr. Mindell continues to provide the reader with concise, accurate information regarding the usage of vitamins for health reasons.If you desire to participate in your own healthcare - then this book will be beneficial to you as well. Use this book to help when deciding on the purchase of nutritional supplements or in cooking healthier."
2,fine but not much cooling,"The effectiveness of the XPad depends a lot on where the hottest part of your laptop is located - so it varies by laptop. I have had this over many years - 4 different laptops and it is better with some than others. If the hottest part is in the between the four raised rubber parts - then it will be cooler, otherwise, not so much.However, it doesn't really cool. It just makes using the laptop slightly more comfortable. I wouldn't really recommend it. I don't however know of better solutions so keep using this. Maybe time to try the USB powered ones.Oh, the non-slip part is really cool. It is very solid."
3,Not worth the Price,"Let me state first that I use the Xpad solely for the purpose of cooling my laptop. I rarely put my laptop on my lap and use it, and if I did, I would just get a book or something to put it on first. I used a program to measure the internal temperature of my laptop before and after using the Xpad. Typically my laptop temperature without the Xpad is around 40~45 degrees. With the Xpad, after letting it sit on there for about an hour or so, my laptop is around 38~42 degrees, which is not much of a difference. The only function my Xpad does is boost my laptop up a little higher so that I can slide an ice pack in between the laptop and the Xpad. A simple gel ice pack that you can buy for 99 cents, lowers my internal temperature to about 32~34 degrees, which is much better as you can see than Xpad. So if your computer overheats, don't buy this, buy either an ice pack or a cheaper powered fan. Even though they aren't portable, they will actually do something in cooling off your laptop."
1,Don't waste your time with this product.,"The company is the worst company I've dealt with on the web. Communication is non-existent. When I opened the package the Xpad was dirty and had cracks on two of the legs, It looks used. I ordered this for my macbook. I have not seen any major or minor drops in temperature (iStat). I would suggest anything else but this poorly manufactured product."
1,"Looks great, but doesn't cool.","I liked the look, rep, and priceof this item. But when I received it...I realized it was just a piece pf plasctic with no fan."
3,burning up,"got this for my white 13"" macbook because i liked the idea of not sucking up power with a usb-powered cooler w fans. the reviews were pretty convincing to the xpad's cooling power sans fans, but i saw no difference. my mac is still hot as hell. i even downloaded a temperature monitor to see if there was any significant change and nothing. but the pad is comfortable/compact enough (i mostly use my laptop on my bed), keeps my flesh from being burned and has a nice look so i'll keep it. this product is not worth $25; i'll probably reluctantly look into a usb-powered cooling mat with fans.EDIT: couldn't take it anymore. returning as if anything my laptop feels even hotter. i'd rather hear a cooling fan blowing and actually cooling my computer than to hear my laptop's fan blowing full blast all the time."
3,"Good, but not great.","I purchased the xpad awhile ago direct from there website. I had done alot of research before buying and ultimatly settled on the xpad. I wanted to love this thing. Simple design, nothing to plug in, super portable. I will take this with me in my laptop bag. The problem for me is that it's main function, the cooling part, is not quite what I had hopped for. To be fair it does do a good job for it's size and simplicity. I do find especially in the summer months that the pad itself will get warm, almost to the point of hot. This can be really annoying as the rubber bottom surface can be slightly annoying on it's own never mind when it's been heated up.For the money, simplicity, and portability, I would recommend the xpad. Just don't expect perfection in terms of it's cooling ability."
5,Outstanding Product,"The Xpad is excellent. It is light weight, allows the laptop to get air and run cooler. Most importantly it blocks heat from coming through to your lap. I've bought two. My wife and I both love it."
4,Does the job it is designed to do!,"I was impressed with this product. It was actually thinner than the ""fan"" models I had been looking at. Did not make any noise as it does not have electronic parts and it was relatively thin. I have used it for well over 1.5 years now with my Mac Pro and I tend to use it for travel and home use. It does keep the computer cooler and deflects the heat away from the user's lap. However, at times, I still find myself placing a pillow between it and my lap during long term use. If it is placed on a hard surface with the computer on top of it, to me it functions best. It is slightly thicker than I would like as I carry mine in my bag with me during travels, and slightly rounded edges would be a nice improvement, but overall, I much prefer this to other solutions on the market. I do plan to purchase the new thinner model as well."
1,THE SMELL CAUSES TERRIBLE HEADACHES,"This product received one star because the smell was unbearable. Even after soaking two nights in soapy water and leaving outside for a couple nights, the sharp rubber smell triggered my migraine headaches. At first I thought it was just me, buy my wife also started to have headaches. I returned the item today, and unfortunately, while packing the product, I caught a wave of the smell and now...I have a headache. The product worked fine and did what it needed to do but the smell was a complete and utter dealbreaker. If you read this and think, ""it won't be that bad"" or ""i can fix it,"" good luck and don't say no one warned you."
2,Cooler? Maybe...,"My laptop still heats up a lot; the pad didn't seem to work that much... It's ridiculous how much my laptop heats up in the first place, but a slight disappointment that it doesn't work like other people said it does."
3,"good , but dam costly","the stuff is good and light weight , but the price for this rubber piece is way too much , i mean price around $10 would have been enough or at max $15 for this rubber piece , its good , but the seller should reduce the price ,then more n more customer will buy this.if u have mac , then i bet you have got an elephant , now for feeding your elephant , you have to spend etc bucks each month , and so this is it , spend some etc bucks and buy this rubber piece and enjoywell yeah its good , it do as it says and it is light"
4,Writers find inspiration here too,"As an adjunct faculty member at Harvard University and co-president of WriteDirections.com which is the Web's first virtual distance-learning writing university, I find that of the students who ""attend"" our classes on writer's block and creativity, the ones who seem the most prepared and ready to progress are those that mention having read this book. Students report being able to recover their creativity from a variety of blocks, especially limiting beliefs in themselves, fear, and self-doubt. It certainly keeps our faculty on their toes!"
5,MOVED ME TO GET BUSY WRITING,"I've had this book for years and I keep referring back to it. It was very instrumental in helping me to unlock my creativity and get out of my own way. Thank you Julia for a timeless, inspirational book. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
2,a bit dated - better books out there,"A lot of people rave about this book. I don't really get it. It feels a little bit like the 12-step program, and the author's thoughts are a little bit disorganized. I feel there are better books today on the subject. For general information about creativity, I prefer ""A Whole New Mind"" by Daniel Pink. And for a more practical how-to book on reinvention and creativity in today's world:reDESIGN: reCREATE: Reinvent Yourself and Thrive in the New Economy"
2,no thank you,"It's a good idea, really it is. It just gets a too Christian. I believe in myself, I believe in molecules,so it makes me feel uncomfortable and even more depressed when it is suggested that I thank the ""Great Creator"".That's all. I gave it two tries. Maybe I'm just weak."
4,Very interesting and a good resource for the creative,This is a good book for the visual artist and other types of artisans who need to find ways to explore their own creative needs and a way to unleash your creativity. Also has a semi-spiritual amount of content that ties to the creative. But not the beat you over the head type. Overall a very good resource.
5,Life changing book,This book got into my hands at a crucial moment in my life and has been a life changing experience. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with self doubt about your capacity to create art.Do the 12 weeks and you will discover a new you.
3,no muy bueno,"el diseño del bolso no es muy bueno, le falta una agarradera de mano, ya que es incomodo cargar con el en el hombro solamente"
4,Not a bad workout,"This video is formated so you have a step quide and a three part workout. I do not overly care for this, since the step quide is just boring to watch, but if you don't watch it you might have a little trouble getting started with the routines. All the steps and combinations are pretty easy though, so you could probably pick it up on your own by the second time around. At first I didn't think the workout was doing much for me, but my the end I did start to feel it a little bit. With this type of tape the more you get into the dance the more you'll get out of it. I wouldn't make this my main workout, but it is a nice change of pace for someone working out every day. The main plus to this video is Marie Forleo, who keeps you motivated without being annoying."
4,A close second to Hemingway...,"For those looking for modern commentary on the ""sporting life"" or a journey into the mind of men who have trouble with modern gender issues then this is a good place to start. McGuane seems to be trying to fill Hemingway's waders (particularly ""In Our Time"") with this collection; he certainly conveys a similar tone.If you have a background in hunting and/or fishing then these stories will likely appeal to you. If not, there is still one story worth reading simply because it aptly demonstrates why we need to abandon the myth of the male who expresses no emotions for fear of showing his weakness.Unfortunately it appears to be out of print but it is worth tracking down."
3,"Very out dated, but useful","We are using this for my sign language class at UGA. I think it is very outdated, especially the people in the video, but it has good exercizes and practice activities and it good at teaching ASL, not just the signs."
3,So So,This is an older version of lessons. It is very hard to follow but with help from a trained signer it can be benificial.
5,Love this! Whew It's in your hands!,"This album is awesome! She delivers on this and then some! I am so happy to own this Album and our children enjoy this album as well (ages 11 through 1 our Arrows)! If you are down and need a pick up pop this in.. And I will tell you, the first song will pick you up!!This is a great album to add to your praise and worship routine. I like to end with this album starting right after laying on my face and the first song reminds me It's in his hands! Glory!You will enjoy this album. Somebody, Never let you down, He can Oh Yes he can! Glory!The dream that would not die, keep dreaming! Yours always, thy way, This is that, cry, we need a word from the Lord, Celebrate my life, and This is that remix!Good, for traffic jams, doing chores, praise and worship, work hour time, change the atmosphere with this album. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Safety risk,"When squeezed it burst a small hole with a liquid uzzing out. Not sure of liquid content,whether it is safe if ingested - contents not listed on packaging. I threw it away."
3,A pregnancy test that takes the whole story to find out the result,The story starts off in the present Miller waiting for the results of the pregnancy testby his girlfriend. It takes the whole book before we find out the results.That in itself is not the problem with the story. The author jumps all over the place with his memories of his life up to now. Some parts interesting other rather dull and average.I bought this story on the Amazon ratings and feel I have been dudded. It is definately not a 4 & 1/2 star story. 3 star at the best.It an average read nothing new out of the bag to rave about. Great try for a first book for the author. His next few hopefully will be more fast pace and more gripping.I wish the author well.Try this story but its really a 3 star average read.
1,"If this book was on MTV, i'd say NEXT!!!","At its best, ""Reproduction is the Flaw of Love"" is bemusing; at its worst, a complete waste of time. After the novelty of reading such a cliche and poorly-written book wears off, its an impossible read. In a vain attempt to make her characters sound like cool, independent individuals, Grodstein has them champion trivial causes such as ""Prospect Park over Central, the bus over the subway, the Atlantic Monthly over the New Yorker"". While still trying to sound noncomformist, one of her characters scoffs at a friend listening rapper Jay Z: ""You sill listen to corperate rap?"" Is rap the issue, or is it black people? Her bigoted description of two Hispanic sisters in a coffee shop only reinforces what I already know: Grodstein doesn't know what the hell shes talking about.Grow up, man."
5,This movie is hilarious,MR. Suave is funny and real. Maganda sa movie. I want to recommend this to everyone.
2,Definitely NOT for anyone over age 17,"I thought and I read reviews that said that this moisturizer was for mature woman. It's not. It doesn't blend/soak into the skin and moisturize it. I don't know what it did. I did not receive any benefits from this product. It simply does not work. I bought the whole line: Cleanser, acne gel, moisturizer. Cleanser works okay, but it is very drying. The acne gel is not to good on small bumps. I don't like this line."
1,What is the point?,"Another reviewer said he (she?) liked the movie, but didn't say why. Too bad, because i looked for the reviews to tell me what's the point of this to-me-incoherent, dull, pretentious, and bizarre typically-French piece of philosophy and rambling. E.g., what would you do if you discover a man's body in your date's freezer? Normal people call 911. But in this movie, the girl matter-of=factly helps the date dump the body into the lake. Is that profound, or what?"
1,CD or NOT CD,"Some of these so-called giants are good and some are not good at all. In my opinion Thelonious Monk is by far the most overrated musician of all time. When you listen to monk play he makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You would think he's playing another song ! Whatever he's playing, he's always behind(in his own nonsensical style)in just about every song. To be perfectly honest I can't see what anyone could possibly see in this man.(do yourself a favor) If you want to listen to a genius at the piano listen to Oscar Peterson. Don't insult your intelligence with this CD."
2,Fair for a Harry Potter Fan but not a real Sword Collector,"The only real thing you can say for this blade is that it is all metal. That being said, it is very poor construction. The red ""jewels"" are actually very bad plugs for the screws and you can see the seams in between the 2 pieces that make up the handle and between the handle and blade. Overall It's an interesting piece if you do not look too closely, however if I were to showcase it (which is what I personally like to do) and to hand it so someone to inspect, then it is not a very good buy. I would suggest spending your $60 (+ or -) on a replica of harry's or hermione's wands."
2,accesories,not that good type of product. you can;t keep cash in this wallet since it will fall out on the left side since it is not clsed. This wallet is olnly goods for cards.
4,Good blades but don't last as long as the original,"These blades are for the Stout X-Band Cordless Band Saw. They fit well and cut well. The only reservation I have about them is that they seem to be more brittle than the original and so they tend to not last as long before they break. I can't quantify it any more than that since I haven't kept any kind of written records about the type and quantity of materials that I have cut with each blade. I can say that I have used the saw for a variety of metals (mostly mild steel) and plastics (acrylic, polycarbonate, polyethylene, PVC), haven't run into anything they couldn't cut yet. One of the big advantages of a band saw for cutting plastics is that the large moving surface area of the blade dissipates heat much better than a small blade such as a sabre saw so it doesn't melt the plastic and cause any blade binding. I think they're a reasonable deal and would buy them again."
4,"The ""Water Gospel"" Exposed","This book is aggressive and Scriptural, attacking with fervency the false teachings of baptismal regeneration and other practices. Sometimes the author is a bit too harsh on those he is criticizing, but the message is solid. I recommend the book for what it sets out to do: debunk the Churches of Christ."
4,"Good single for KT fans, but get her albums first","For KT Tunstall fans who already have all of her albums, this single might be a good addition to your collection. ""Another Place To Fall"" is a great song from her first album ""Eye To The Telescope"". The reason to get this single would be her cover of Radiohead's ""Fake Plastic Trees"". I'm a Radiohead fan too and while I still prefer their original version of the song, I've warmed up to KT's version after a few listens. It's very different from the original, featuring just a piano to accompany her beautiful voice with a drumbeat coming in - to dramatic effect - toward the end. I would still recommend getting each of her albums including ""Acoustic Extravaganza"" before this, especially since it's out of print and can be expensive."
2,With Fire & Sword,"I had great expectations on this film and I was quite dissappointed on what I had read about Husaria and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. I do not know if the film is as the book of the Nobel Prize Writer, but nevertheless for me it did not mean what I expected. Sorry folks."
4,Nice toy,"My kids like this toy. I agree with previous posters:The coins don't fit in the drawer-you will be better off storing them elsewhere.Otherwise you will not be able to open the drawer.The scanner is indeed random, and will scan the same item at different prices.BUT most kids who play with this toy will not notice, due to their age.They ALL love the microphone and use this feature most often! And the amount of pieces this game comes with is great - loads of fake credit cards, money, etc. And I love the fact that it comes with a little sack/purse to store it all in!"
1,Overrated and Overpriced,"I bought this for my 3-year old for Christmas and wish I could return it. For one, the drawer does not close with the coins inside the coin holders. So much for it working like a cash register! Also, you have to scan the cards just right otherwise the scanner will not read it or will read it incorrectly. The hand held scanner doesn't work at all - it is just for pretend. Also, ours shuts off automatically if my daughter does not scan the next item quickly enough, which means that she cannot practice totaling up her purchases or payment. Lastly, the price here is outrageous! I bought it much much cheaper elsewhere and still feel like I got ripped off!"
5,"Ah, the humanity!!","Bless Andrea Buchanan for providing such a REAL book about the trials and tribulations of parenthood! I often find myself laughing out loud, and pages later, tearing up at her poignant description of her daughter. Truly, I am purchasing this book for friends who have recently experienced ""mother shock"" as I hope that they too can feel more understood by sharing Andrea's perspective!! Kudos, Ms. Buchanan, on an EXCELLENT book!"
5,The BEST gift for a new mom!,"After you are done with all those other parenting books - the ones that tell you how to pick a stroller or play peek-a-boo with your baby or how to tell a hungry cry from a tired cry - sit down and enjoy this wonderful book.When you are having one of those moments - the ""why didn't anyone tell me what this motherhood stuff was *really* like"" moments - sit down and read a chapter of this book.I used to give the traditional books at baby showers. Dr. Sears. Dr. Spock. Not anymore. Now I give this book! It's a refreshing look at the real side of motherhood. The good, the bad, and the hilariously funny."
3,Toast,"Why don't toaster ovens toast anymore? This one was ranked very high in consumers for its ability to toast; however, the bread dries out before it begins to toast. Maybe there is no such thing as a toaster oven that does good quick toast."
5,Absolutely WONDERFUL!,"I am the child care director at a Christian Day Care. My original plan was to pick one story in the Pray and Play Bible per month and develop a theme around that Bible Story. My goal was to read the story once a week and do a related craft. However, the children BEG me to read the chosen story of the month over and over. They want to hear the stories more than once a week. At the end of each story, they remind me to ""do the song"". They absolutely LOVE the songs and fingerplays after each story. The crafts are great too. However, I do find that I do a lot of research online to find crafts to supplement what is in the book. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I will be purchasing the Pray & Play Bible 2 to use for next school year. I hope it is as great as the first edition. :)"
5,FLAPPIN FLOP OF HOW DO THEY DO THAT!?,"to put edgar meyer's bass playing in perspective.... the two top cellos at my school walked in the room while i was listening to this and their jaw's dropped...... then when they heard the furious and yet passionate bass drop down six octaves they jumped back in awe! ""that's a bassist!?"" now.. having said that... not once does his work take away from the song... and both of the other players are astonishing through the entire album. I love this CD..... R&B.... Fusion... Jazz... Country... Rock... Classical.... as long as you dig music and not a genre of it... just as a woman loves the diamond on her ring and not just one facet of it....you'll probably enjoy this CD.... very thoroughly."
3,"good, but not great","Although I was pleased to see the return of the Rouges in this book, I thought that the last Rouge Squadron based novel did a good job of tying up all the loose ends with the characters, which lead to this book running low on character development. The return of Isard was a big disappointment at the start, because the first four books were dedicated to her downfall and her ""death"". I felt as if Stackpole ran out of ideas for villains and was just using an old one to create a new book, but then as the plot progressed I ended up liking the book, as Stackpole used his fleshed out characters like Corran and Gavin, and highly descriptive battle sequences to move the mediocre plot along. Overall a fun read but lacking depth."
2,"Not horrible, but not good","The first star wars books that I read were in the x-wing series and I thought that they were all pretty good. After I finished Solo Command I picked up the original trilogy by Timothy Zahn... Wow, his books were so much better than the x-wing series even though they were ok too. But after reading the Thrawn trilogy I can't really give Isard's Revenge that good of a review because to me it just doesn't measure up."
4,"Excellent book, but previous ones are better.","Excellent story, awesome action. Incredible book all around. Mr. Stackpole has wrote another fantastic book. His previous X-Wing books were all 5 stars, so this one was a little let down."
3,"Stackpole is great at Battletech.. Star Wars, not so much","Stackpole is an awesome author. But he still doesn't have the STAR WARS universe down yet. Little things like time and distance measurements are in earth terms whereas, in other STAR WARS books they use STAR WARS ""Standard"" time and distance units. If I read about Wedge swallowing the lump in his throat or bite his lower lip one more time I will puke. Other than that, good read with alot of twists and turns. =)"
3,Bre's,"Because Isard's Revenge was only my second X-wing book I didn't catch on at first (that happens when you read books out of order) but it wasn't too long before I did. I enjoed this book mainly because of the exciting plot. I like books that don't stop until the end. Having read it for a second time (as well as all the other books) I understand it better. I felt it carried on well after Thrawn Trilogy, as well as letting fans catch up on Wedge and co."
3,One of the better from the series.,"This is the first book in the X-Wing trilogy that had a somewhat feasable plot. I was a little uncertain as to where Isard got all of her TIE Defenders, and the pilots to fly them. There are still too many characters to keep track of well. Also, characters who return from the dead seriously bothered me, particularly in the end sequence. Star Wars can do better, but the X-Wing series rarely can. IF you liked the others in the series, then buy this book, otherwise read Heir to the Empire."
3,Exhaustive and exhausting,"This anthology includes darn near everything you can think of. Though the works of major authors (say for instance Cooper) are sometimes given short shrift in favor of the ""marginalized"" voices of obscure writers (Frances Sargent Lock Osgood, to cite only one example), there is an abundance of worthwhile material for classroom study in its 3000-plus pages of fine print.My complaint is that in the service of being inclusive, the editors have constructed such a painfully heavy and dense text that it will be a chore to read or to take anywhere. As a teacher I want to encourage wide reading of American literature, but I don't want to burden them with a book that is so reader-unfriendly that they'll bristle every time they have to crack open this hulking giant."
5,LOVE IT,WHEN i READ THIS BOOK I CAN'T PUT DOWN . I LOVE ALL HER BOOKS .MY MOST FAVORITE BOOK YOU GOT HOLD ON ME.
5,Splintering,"I loved this book. Each poem left me screaming for more details and overcome with emotion. While I normally have a hard time understanding free verse poetry, the writing is very readable and Corrigan avoids complicated metaphors that require an English class to decipher. In fact, Many of the poems didn't seem like poems at all until I read them aloud (hence, read them aloud!!!). Not to say that the poems aren't deep, this is definitely a book you will want to read more than once.I loved this book, not only for the story it told, but for the way it made me feel."
2,Set of 9 chisels,"Three of the nine chisels had chips out of the cutting edge, two more so than the third. The handles appear to be on the lower class end. I had hoped for better product."
2,lacking something,"I really liked his earlier ""autobiographical collage"", _Palm Sunday_, because it gave a lot of insight into his motivations and ideas for stories. _Fates Worse than Death_ doesn't have that, and furthermore, the typical Vonnegut humor is rare within. If you haven't read _Palm Sunday_ yet, read that one first/instead."
3,"Another tedious, yet interesting, look at the man himself","Oh, great. Another ""Autobiographical collage"", as though there's anything left to say we really want to here after trudging through ""Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons"" and ""Palm Sunday.""Surprisingly, then, this one holds up fairly well on its own; when Vonnegut talks about his daughter's marriage to Geraldo, or shares his thoughts on war and religion this book genuinely picks up pace. But please, Kurt, do us a favor. We love you, we're interested about you, but we WANT NEW FICTION!"
1,totally unnecessary,"The only reason you would need cliff notes for this book is if you are lazy or short on time and theres a test the next day. Yet the cliff notes arent descriptive enough for you to get the whole book. I can understand needing cliff notes for the confusing dialect of ""tale of two cities"", or the background and analysis for ""Brave new World"", but going through the Catcher in the Rye is a breeze, and the book is enjoyable. Its one of my favorite books ever. Dont even bother with these cliff notes."
1,A shame,"I was checking the comments on The Catcher in the Rye and saw that there were Cliff Notes on this book. I couldn't believe it! That someone would actually write notes on The Catcher in the Rye. This book should never be summarized into Cliff Notes. This book should be read in its entirety or not at all, regardless of how much time you have. This book can be read easily in a few hours, and it's the best book I've read in a while. It is a disgrace that this book was allowed to be put into Cliff Notes and these are for people who are too lazy or ignorant to pick up the actual book."
1,PLEASE DON''T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!,"In essence this book tells you to get a rubber band, put it around your wrist and flick it hard against your skin so it hurts every time you feel the urge to ""target"" i.e. feel your fingers for rough patches that you could potentially bite. This is meant to make you give up your nail biting habit, but you will more-than-likely end up with a very sore wrist!This has got to be the one of the best scams around. A clever way to prey on the vulnerable. Don't be sucked in."
2,To expensive for 2 megapixels!,"I saw this camera online for 200 dollars so i bought it and tested it out. For thr price i thought i was getting a 3 megapicel camera or better. So, i tested it out and i was very disappointed. The pcture quality was ok but it was not worth the price. I then bought a the Vivitar 3.3 megapixel camera for 88 dollars. It was so much better. Save your money DONT BUY THIS CAMERA"
4,Sentimental and touching,"I had read an excerpt from ""Roadcat"" in a magazine and at the end the source was given. I am an animal lover to the core, and I knew I had to have the book. It was worth the purchase just for that story alone!! All the tales are not about animals (and I guess that might have been a bit of a disappointment), but it is a lovely quiet book to enjoy in restful sentimental moments. The stories are about animals, people, places, events, etc., and the telling is easy to read and very pleasant. I definitely recommend it."
3,Policeman outfit,"A little big, nephew liked the accessories. Not very heavy as our Octobers here can be quite cold out! Most children would like the outfit because it does look like a real cop outfit"
4,Couldn't find at Lowes or Home Depot,"Its the correct breaker for my CH type electrical load center.The right parts make the expansion of the center easy. Lowes and Home Depot may have left me me high and dry , but Amazon came through."
2,Not satisfied.,The main piece that I wanted was the ear piece to talk handfree. The ear piece gives off a ringing sound to the person that I am talking to. I do not hear it on my end but am unsuccessful in using it because it is an irritation to the people I talk to.
5,I Spy Halloween,We have enjoyed many hours playing our own way of I spy. Thank you for your promt delivery.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HIGHCHAIR,"I have this high chair and I am terribly disappointed in it. It will take you all the time between feedings to get this chair clean and sanitary. Food gets everywhere, you even have to use a toothpick to clean in certain places. I contacted Peg Perego about it and they pretty much told me to contact the company I got it from, it is out of their hands. I was terribly disappointed with their customer service and this product. I purchased the Fischer Price Healthy Care High Chair for my mom and dad's house and wish I had gotten that one for myself. Please save yourself the extra money, and get something so much easier to clean!!!"
1,WAIST OF MONEY!,"This chairchair was the worst investment I ever made. I hate it! The base is huge, so it takes up so much room in the kitchen. Also, it is very, very hard to clean. There are so many little crevices and niches, that's it's such a chore to get every bit of food off of it. Also, the food tray is up very high and it's far away from the baby or toddler's body, so there are lots of accidents. I read a lot of reviews that people thought this chair was good looking, and I'd have to disagree. I think it's such an eye soar. OH! And I got the chair with the rocking feature & it never worked. This chair has so many features that I never used or needed. I would recommend buying a very simple, cheap highchair & then when your child is old enough invest in the STOKKE KINDERZEAT. I wish I never waisted my money on this!!!!"
1,Did not receive,"Did not receive After the Promise! Do not understand the delay, could someone please explain why there is a delay and if the product will ever be available.Please explain the delay in detail ~ thanks."
1,Pentax Red Dot Sight,"I purchased this sight based upon the Pentax name for quality mechandise and its specifications stating it was durable enough for shotgun or pistol applications. I mounted the scope on a .22 rim fire rifle that has negligible recoil. Within less than 100 rounds, the red dot became intermittent because the rheostat knob had become so loose it was not making contact. The Pentax warranty says they will repair the scope if the unfortunate buyer pays the postage to send the scope to them and includes a check for $19.95 to cover the cost of the return. Their work is guaranteed for 90 days. So for half the cost of a new scope you can take you chances that their second try to provide a non-defective product will be successful. I don't think I'll send good money after bad, but buy another brand instead."
2,disappointed,The point is not sharp enough to grab many logs-- especially those that have lost their bark. The tool is completely worthless as a cant dog. It simply is not designed correctly to grab the logs that I was trying to use it on. And I consider these to be normal sized logs - between 6 and 10 inches in diameter. Buy something else.
4,enlivens our enlightenment!,What a delight to read and to savor the messages in this writing. The author clearly reveals his own journey through the somewhat messy process of becoming more fully human and holy. These revelations are minor compared to the wisdom that is distilled in wonderful reflective statements about the entire process of growth. Reading this book is a most useful and prayerful exercise
1,NOT GOOD,"These bars, unlike others I've ordered from Amazon were old. Chocolate was cracked, dry and dusty. Very disappointed. Stay away from this mess."
1,These were stale!!!!,"I think these had been on the shelf for the past ten years. They were horrible, it is better to buy them in the store where you know they are fresh."
2,Diahrea overload,"These bars were delish but it was an Maltitol overload and chocolate for my diabetic self. I can only eat half a bar at a time and even then, it induced terrible diahrea. Be careful with these bars, if you have colon issues or any other stomach trouble, I believe the imitation sweetner overload along with chocolate mix can cause gas pains and diahrea."
2,Almost couldn't be eaten...,"Lots of coconut and the coconut was tough. I chewed and chewed and finally had to spit it out. I was literally concerned that I would break a tooth trying to bite into these. I'll use the box up by using a butcher knife to cut them into small pieces. They're not old, they expire 10 months from now. I won't buy these again."
2,"Yum, yum, yum...but actually problematic on low carb diet. :-(","I bought these bars to eat while doing the Atkins Diet. I sometimes run around all day long and don't have time to eat.These bars are a fabulous meal replacement - delicious and satisfying.BUT...I question whether the ""net carbs"" approach is accurate. Since beginning to consume these bars on a regular basis for meal replacement I've GAINED weigh and also became super BLOATED...to the point that I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.I generally have a stomach of steel but the synthetic, chemical nature of these bars apparently doesn't agree with my system, which is more of a ""purist"" I guess.I bought a whole bunch of these bars in different flavors and I'm disappointed that I'll need to give them away.If you decide to try these tread slowly and see whether they agree with your body."
1,Rancid Peanuts,"I opened the first box and ate a bar and noticed immediately that the peanuts were rancid. I assumed that it may have just been that bar that was bad, but when I tried another it was too! I tried one more before I threw the whole box away. The ""expiration date"" was in March 2013, so they should have been good. Unfortunately, they were a big disappointment."
2,Received,iin good order. Service was excellent as was packaging. I did not like the taste of this product. I like the coconut but nite this one.
1,Hard and Sticky,I don't know how anyone could eat something as hard and sticky as this bar. i didn't like it at all. it was too hard on my teeth too sticky on them and hard to clean after. really bad definitely wont buy them again.
2,not as good as other Atkins bars,I order a lot of Atkin protein bars which are normally excellent tasting. I have to say this one didn't taste nearly as good as most. The chocolate has an odd taste to it whereas the other bars I have tried don't.
5,Excellent Bars!,These bars are fantastic! Well worth the # of carbs....I have yet to have an Atkins Bar that I didn't love!
2,atkins,"too chewy, not crunchy, not tasty...more almonds and less sticky almost sugar glue would improve the flavor and desire to try another."
4,Discovering the Path to Wisdom,"A brief synopsis of the term ""Ancient Paths"" as it appears in the book of Jerimiah. Greg Hill brings the significance of this term down to how we live in the 21st Century. He cites case histories of those who failed to recognize this path as a guide for living outside of bizarre sex and drug cultures that dominate our world. You will come away with a renewed vison for how we must relate to our children and to others we encounter each day. A short and rich book. Take time to read it and be renewed in thought."
1,Glaring mistakes throughout the book,"I briefly owned this book, but had to return it after a day and a half due to the preponderence of incorrect information I found. Although this book is meant to be an overview of Stegonography without getting too deep into the technical aspects, I seriously question the author's expertise in this area of study. The author was seriously in error when detailing some BASIC cryptography concepts. If this guy was actually developing security tools for real world use, I would never be able to trust that my systems were secure."
4,Unique and pleasant.,It is refreshing to hear something new. The tracks are old favorites but the sound is new. Different. And in a good way.Not the same old interpretations sped up or slowed down. But a genuine new groove down a familiar road.She is a great violinist and has a knack for interplay with the rest of the band. It's not a flashy highly technical performance like you may expect from Perlman or Mutter. But not on the emotional ragged edge like Sonnenberg. But something in between with a new twist.
3,A little hard to stay focused...,"The subject matter was what had me buying this book, but it was hard to stay intrigued with the text-book language used. The pictures were great and it had a lot of useful information, but this is a book I would only use for research. Not for the light reader!"
5,doctoral research text,"Makes a very compelling case, for giving a modernized viewpoint of our own Taliban, in new England and a vision of mass panic."
3,great for teenagers,"this book would be great if i was a 12 year old gay boy and wanted to memorize the vital statistics of the show. otherwise, nice pictures, some inside info i didn't know beforehand, and a nice tribute to the show."
2,Not as good as her children's books,"I adore ""the Secret Garden"" and ""the Little Princess"", so I was excited to see this book for adults by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It was ok, but not great. It features a plucky heroine, but there's just not very much character development or attention to detail."
2,too little,Geez. The book contains too little info and immediately tells you to buy other books in the series.
3,The story is far more exciting.,"The credits (where you get to see the snake in action) are more exciting than Brett et al. Better than some (the abominable 'Naval Treaty'), worse than others (the dashing 'Solitary Cyclist'). Your pick."
5,Fantastico!!!,"Realmente no hay palabras para describir esta produccion de los chicos de Pereza. Personalmente me gusta cada una de las canciones en este cd. Tuve la oportunidad de verlos en persona en un cafe de la ciudad de Valladolid - España y fue una experiencia unica. El dueño del cafe ""Huesos"" (Hola Majo!) conoce a los integrantes de esta estupenda banda, me los presento y aparte de tener musica increible los tios son super sencillos. Verdaderamente recomiendo este cd, para mi es uno de mis favoritos. Acaban de salir una nueva produccion que se llama ""Animales"" ojala pronto se pueda adquirir por Amazon. Luis, San Diego - California."
2,Too many problems with the software,"The Power Toefl CDROM deluxe has content but the software is too poor to make this purchase worth. First, this software doesn't work well with Windows 2000. The sound files necessary for the listening comprehension part are not supported. Run it on Win 95 or 98. Second, the instructions provided are not accurate and some of the most important ones are missing, e.g. you have to type ""q"" at the very end of a test to know your score. And do not miss the screen at which you can do it, otherwise, you simply can't get your score!!! Finally, there is no way you can come back to a previous screen. This is normal for the test part itself but should be an option provided in the introductory part. You have to stop the program if you missed a click!!! In a nutshell, this software looks very much like what a total beginner in programming would be able to produce. The content is allright but there are better bargains available."
2,not happy,"pepper,salt and garlic that's it. You don't know the ingredients until you open the box and it is on the inter package. the product is ok but expensive for just black pepper ,salt and garlic flakes"
1,Missing Book,I don't feel that I can leave a responce because the book never came. I waited for the book for three weeks before I got an email. I was hoping to use the book for a thesis I was writing on Jackie Robinson.
2,Skip This One,"Hewson's novel is a waste of good talent. He's clearly capable of more fluid writing and characterization than the jumbled, piecemeal story placed before us.The story revolves around a cult of Dionysius that engages in sexual epicurianism and drug use. Things went awry at one of the parties years ago; and when the victim's body turns up in a Roman suburbian bog, the police are called in to investigate. The characters are predictable and trite, and the plot never seems to connect at all the appropriate points. The ending is a letdown, and I don't think I'll be following any of the future adventures of Nic Costa, et al."
2,scam,I am so upset that this video has not one new song from the rest of the other videos. I guess the guys are willing to do anything to make a buck even ripping off their fans. Christina S.
5,Another winner from the Wiggles!!,Here we get a sneak peek at the Wiggles t.v. show-and what a great show it is!! All our faves are here and they all get their time to shine!! There is still plenty of music to keep the kids entertained and dancing. The lessons are well done and not too long. They teach are kids about family and the universe and sun all in a seamless and fun way. It's a great addition to the Wiggles collection.
2,Know going in that you're just buying TV episodes,"I didn't, and I was very disappointed. With four showings daily on the Disney Channel, why on earth would I waste my money on a tape full of TV episodes?Besides, the other Wiggles videos offer something different than the formula of the TV show, and that helps maintain my 22-month-old daughter's interest when she watches them. Not so here. She's not old enough to really understand viewing a TV show vs. a video, and when I put this one on, she keeps pointing to the cover, assuming I've not yet started the tape.Yes, the box says waaaaay down in the description that this material was culled from TV material, if you read that far. But if you're like me, you see the shiny box with smiling Wiggles faces, trust the franchise, and buy it. Oops.If you're looking for TV show material, you'll love it. Otherwise, buyer beware! I feel ripped off, which is something I don't often say in reference to The Wiggles."
5,A House Favorite,"Though this is more sedate and not as original (song-wise) as previous Wiggles videos, I'd still highly recommend it. My two-year-old really likes watching the guys do their numerous silly skits just as much as he enjoys dancing along to the catchy tunes (even I still get a chuckle out of ""John Bradlelum""). If your child is into the Wiggles no matter what they're doing, then this one's a good choice."
5,For anyone who thinks religion isn&#65533;t dangerous.,"What they made of Uta Ranke-Heinemann in the faculty of theology at Heidelberg doesn't bear thinking about. But I would point out to Cardinal O'Connor that the only ""dirty words"" in this book issue from the mouths and pens of Catholic clerics. If anything I would say that the author is too restrained. She is, after all, recording more than nineteen hundred years of the most maddeningly-illogical, puerile, foul-mouthed, dyspeptic and vicious misogyny being perpetrated in the name of the ""universal church"". That her anger seeps through so rarely is a great testimony to her control. The facts, as she clearly sees, speak for themselves."
3,I didn't mind this movie at all.,"In the middle of all this mess, Mena Suvari has to deal with her annoying sibling which reminded me of a play set in a concentration camp when in the midst of this murder, one of the future victims has to deal with his emotionally abusive father who is also marked for death. Mena Suvari is charming in this movie and much better looking in her fatigues than many actresses in love to shop movies. She has a great face. I hope she gets better roles in movies I'll want to see."
1,"The ""Jason X"" of zombie movies.","This is quite possibly the worst zombie movie ever made folks, no joke.Zombies that can somehow stick to walls and ceilings like Spiderman..Zombies that explode and turn to ash when set on fire, like the vampires in Blade..Zombie vegetarians that don't eat flesh....and that's just the tip of this genre-sinking iceberg. Steve Miner must have either lost a bet or made this on a dare, because no sane person would create a movie like this on purpose."
2,Beware the Spider-Zombies!,"What a waste. I was really hoping Steve Miner could pull this off. This is a huge insult to George Romero. Let's just say when a movie is direct-to-video, it's ususally for a reason. Snyder's 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was obviously an anomaly and the standard of detestable classic horror remakes is alive and well with the 2008 ""Day of the Dead"".The zombies are truly laughable: they bounce around like the monkey-bats from ""The Wizard of Oz"", climb walls and ceilings like your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and get instant Freddy Krueger pizza face during the morphing process.I'd give it 1 star, but I have seen worse; much worse. Spider-Zombies can't hold a candle to the Raccoon-Eye Zombies of the repugnant spectacle that was Ulli Lomell's ""Zombie Nation"".Do yourself a favor, skip this and buy any of the official Romero flicks or the Snyder remake of ""Dawn"". Already own 'em? Upgrade and buy 'em in blu-ray. That would be money well spent."
1,Severely Disappointed,I love the George Romero movies and was hoping it would be an updated version of the original. I was very disappointed to find it was nothing like the Romero film and was very poorly made overall. I hope you don't waste your time like I did.
1,Garbage,"Absolutely terrible. Good zombie movies are hard to come by, and well this is another one of the terrible ones unfortunately. They've taken a classic and completely ruined it. I got 2 words for you. Nick Cannon. That is all."
1,Bad all around.,"I did not buy mine from Amazon and the case came damaged. Ving Rhames is the best actor in the movie and he is not even in it much. Everyone else is terrible. The zombies can leap tall buildings in a single bound. No plot. Just bad all around.If you are a zombie movie fan like I am, you may still want to pick it up, but prepared for it to suck."
3,Dead is right,"This was disappointing in many ways, the whole ""Super Zombie"" thing was horrible, they tried to develop the characters but had so little back story it was poor. I really was hoeing that it would be a continuation of Dawn of the Dead, still in my opinion the best of my Zombie flick arsenal. The acting wasn't as bad as your typical Zombie flick and once you realize that this is not going to be as good as Dawn of the Dead, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. You can enjoy the film. I just don't like forcing myself to enjoy a movie. If you are a Zombie flick fan then yes this must be in your collection. If you are just starting to enjoy Zombie flicks, then wait till your already hooked."
2,Suckfest,Awful acting bad special effects but at least the writing was terrible. Don't wast the 90 minutes on this one. Better to watch dawn of the dead twice than watch this.
3,"Ok, but there are buts...","When i got the watch, the battery was dead, i had to buy a new battery andspend a little more than what i expected. havent tried it underwater to see if it really is water resistan, but i guess i wont tempt it. But other than that its working fine."
3,Back Up Singer,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend of mine who remembered 1 song called Smiling Islands by Mr. Patton and Stevie Nicks. I was thoroughly underwhelmed by not only that song, but by all of the songs on this CD. However, my friend loved it. So I am giving it 1 star for me, and 2 for him."
2,Too Depressing,"This story was too depressing for me. The main character, Girl, was not likeable and I struggled to finish the book."
5,Great selection,"This contains:The Turn of the ScrewWashington SquareDaisy MillerThe Beast in the JungleThe Jolly Cornerand a good introduction by R. W. B. Lewis, who wrote a Pulitzer prizewinning biography of Edith Wharton.I think those last three pieces are his best-known nouvelles, and the top two are his best-known short novels. Wow. They're a nice place to start with James, too."
4,THE SAMPLES ARE WRONG FOR THIS ALBUM,"These are not the samples that appear on the album! The real album sounds in no way like that at all. It has lots of lush, hypnotic beats, and is a fine display of how hip hop should really be."
4,Classic Pete Rock,Typical Pete Rock jazz-laden hip-hop beats only they unobstructed by vocals. Some of the tracks are a somewhat repetitive but they are pure hip-hop.
1,An Abomination,"The music was beyond reproach and the performers well cast. So why the one star? An opera, to me, is a story set by the composer in a setting of time and place. It is a visual and audial work of love where sound and sight are carefully joined to achieve the composer's purpose. Dvorak's beautiful fairy tale has been sacrificed to some giant ego who has completely disregarded Dvorak's setting. The opera is a fairy tale with dark woods, wood nymphs, a water goblin, a prince and princess and the protagonist who is a water nymph. How can it be set in a stark room with electric lights and a double bed? The prince comes seeking ""the white doe"" through the ""woods"" in a suit, topcoat and derby!! The only way I could get through this unpleasantness was to close my eyes often and just listen to the music. As another reviewer has said, buy the audio CD of Rene Fleming as Rusulka."
2,Rusalka,"Musically entirely acceptable, but visually a mess. A gross example of directorial indulgence. The modern dress presentation is ludicrously at odds with the fairytale story."
3,"Musically fine, off-putting production values","I have no problem with the musical aspect of this performance of Dvorak's magnificent opera, but I have dinged this production two stars for the contemporary sets and costumes. The opera is a fairy tale, after all, and there's nothing to suggest that here. Particularly off-putting was the large, bland bed-room set that dominates the long second act and serves as the forest and the castle. The pomp and ceremony of the procession is suggested only by the music with nothing visual to support it. The odd modern dance number in the middle served no purpose that I could divine. Sergei Larkin as the Prince is serviceable, but I found myself wishing he had Ben Heppner's voice from the CD recording. Fleming is Fleming. Hawlata and Diadkova both delivered the goods. All in all, this DVD is worth the trouble largely for the music, but was less than satisfying visually. Unfortunately there seems not much else available that would be an improvement."
2,Poorly staged,"Rusalka is among my favorite operas - Dvorak did a wonderful job composing the music to fit beautifully with the plot and the fantasty elements. I have the Fleming CD, and I thankfully did not buy this DVD. I borrowed it from the library, thinking I would at least enjoy it, even if it was imperfect. Giving this DVD two stars is generous. A fairly traditional staging is all that can work with Rusalka; it is a fantasy, set in what is almost another world. As soon as Rusalka's father entered wearing a suit, I knew the production would not be to my liking. It was about halfway through the opera that I realized I would actually hate it. Many portions of the opera become almost entirely nonsensical because the libretto does not match what's happening on stage. The simplistic staging could work for other operas, but Rusalka is a piece of fantasy that deserves better than what this director gave it. The extra star in my review is merely because of the music itself. Not recommended at all"
4,Outstanding in all ways but one,"The singing and acting were outstanding, but I did not understand the ""concept"". I have little complaint against updating operas, so long as they make sense. I liked the pool of water, which I thought was very artistic and effective...but the above bedroom confused me. The ""mirror-image"" seemed unnecessary. Overall I recommend this, but wish there had been an interview with the producer/director to explain the particular vision for this production."
2,Suicide,"This CD player was cheap. Thats the good part. It worked great for a little while, but then slowly self-destructed. I think the Tiny Tim boxed set was the last straw. It never would play CDs I burned on my mac. And the LCD stopped working after a while. I would buy this CD player again if it was so cheap I could get a new one every three months."
5,"""Game"" satisfies","I loved this book, and couldn't put it down. The gay characters are believable and engaging, and the struggle between the lovers is still, unfortunately, timely. The degree to which one person is out compared to the other is an evolving element in gay relationships, and the issue presented in ""The Beheading Game"" is as heart-wrenching as that of the lovers in ""Brokeback Mountain.""I'm not a big fan of medieval poetry from whence Gawain and the Green Knight comes from, but the metaphors applied to a contemporary story are apt and effective. Scenes set in the hospital and the theatre are some of the most memorable in recent literary history."
5,A very smart page turner,"Webster has written a highly intelligent, psychologically compelling book. She has managed to weave a tale that juxtaposes a contemporary father/son/lover triangle with the medieval story of Gawain and the Green Knight. Her chief protagonist is a theatre director and we are drawn into the intricacies of putting on a play: set design, rehearsals, relationships among actors. As in one of her earlier books--Paradise Farm--she fully described the process of creating a painting, here she describes the process of creatng a theatrical production.Interesting characters, a terrific story, some unexpected plot twists, rich detail--not only about the theatre but also about Rome and the life-threatening illness of one of the protagonists, this is a terrific read!!"
3,What did she say?,I loved the melodies and the arrangements and the talent of the musicians. There is a haunting quality to the music and Alison's voice is superb. The only problem (and itis a major one) is I can only understand about half of the words she sings. Such beautiful and well played melodies unfortunately have little meaning when one has to listen so hard to comprehend what the lyrics are saying. It becomes frustrating when one can't put the words to the melody without working at it. Alison - ENUNCIATE!
1,did not get what we ordered,we were very excited to order this product for my brother in law for christmas. However when it arrived in the mail the grip ons were bright orange and had half as many spikes for gripping. we sent them back and hd to give a gift card. If we can find these I would give them next year.
2,Not long lasting,"They are great IF you can keep them on your shoes. I even put them on very carefully on a specific shoe so I wouldn't take them on and off and that I would know it was on each shoe as well as it could be. I wore them twice and lost and found the one that came off the first time. The second time it came off it was gone. If you are in snow/ice all the time, they are fine, but if you get off onto pavement they come off."
4,Works great,"Works great, Easy to put on and off. Price was cheaper than what I could getlocally. Thinking about buying another one for me..."
3,Great fo Outdoor Work,"I choose 3 star rating co'z it delivered the traction I need, easy to put on and it fits on my safety shoe. I like this product co'z it's easy to carry, I can put on my jacket's pocket. The only thing that disappointment me is when I received the package, the left pair is missing one cleats/stad, but is not a big deal still give me good traction when I'm walking my way to work. I recommend this product for those need good traction on there shoe while walking on ice... :-)"
2,Disappointed in how plain they taste,"I was surprised to find that these are PLAIN gummi bears covered in chocolate. That combined with rather bland chocolate leaves you with a very ""meh"" tasting product. There's just no flavor. Even if they were regular flavored Gummmi Bears the chocolate probably wouldn't help at all.I was really looking forward to these but ended up not eating more than a handful due to how uninspired the product ended up being."
1,Grocery,"I ordered this item as a surprise gift for my son since he loves Gummi Bears, thought he would just love some chocolate covered ones, wrong! He said they were terrible and never order them again."
4,Great gloves,"I needed some new gloves to do chores around the house with, these were fantastic. I didn't realize they had a soft inner lining, and were so thick. The only improvement I could ask for is if they were just an inch or so longer.All in all great gloves."
5,Very musically artistic,"NORTH is my first Elvis Costello CD. I did hear some of his past stuff and I really liked it...but NORTH is one of those CDs you can turn on and just lay down and chill. It's like wine drinking music...haha. I really dig Elvis Costello's voice...he's like the modern day Frank Sinatra, at least on this CD he is. And another thing I really like about the album is that most of the songs are just him singing and piano under him. So do yourself a favor, and get this really mellow jazzy album!"
4,Excellence can not be ignored.,"This album is one of the best that I have ever heard from Elvis Costello. The music is simple, elegant, and breathtaking. Once you get past to the lyrics occasionaly halting rhythm, you find a world of emotion. The song list tells a story, and it is a beautiful one of love. Don't miss this album. If you have ever enjoyed beautiful music, nakedly open lyrics, or Elvis Costello, you will enjoy this as well."
4,his best in a while,"Short and sweet, If you are a fan you will love this album. Everyone else just might consider it a bit too mellow. The album is mostly just vocals and a hauntingly beautiful piano. None the less it is worth the time to check it out."
4,great coloring Book,This is a great book. I love flowers and love to decorate this helps me decide which flowers i like in what color scheme.
2,Talented But Tedious,"Eliza Gilkyson sings in a weary and breathy croak that is sometimes engaging, but frequently tiresome. While I appreciate her sincerity, and also the virtuosity of the band members, the songwriting is the glaring weakness. While the poetry occasionally rises above the banal, the music is rarely compelling. In the final analysis, I found a modicum of talent in Eliza and her musicians, but nothing that makes me want to listen to any of this more than a few times."
5,"Amusing, crazy, fun, and entirely un-LC (Lesbianly Correct)","The author definitely saved the best for last when she ended ""The History of Lesbian Hair"" with the those hilarious, yet oh-so-true traffic signs.... Not to say that the rest wasn't outstanding. I paraded this book around to all of my friends for weeks, and not one could keep a straight face as they read the chapter on ""How to Build a Lesbian"". It's also refreshing to see an honest dyke who's not afraid to use lesbian stereotypes as a foundation for her jokes; after all, we can't ALL be these PC, feminist, barbaric types ALL THE TIME, and this book gives us a look into the other side - cool dyke humor."
3,It'll keep your attention.,How can I even begin to describe this book? It starts off like many other noirish books do. A man who has fallen. He's no longer at the top of his game and neither is his marriage. I honestly can't complain about the book but I can say that it does get pretty weird. The sex is something straight out of a perverted porno and when the main characters get to Las Vegas the book does a complete 180.I can't say that I was disappointed in this book; I didn't know what to expect. I can say that I was surprised. Imagine reading a script for the Salton Sea with some Pulp Fiction and Crying Game mixed in for good measure. Oh and lets not forget a sprinkling of David Lynch.Overall I'd say it's worth a look but I wouldn't put it at the top of any list.
2,Not so sturdy,"Maybe if I had carpeting this would be better, but on hard wood, the plastic is too light for my 20 LBS pug and slides when he tries to climb it. I may try getting an area rug or non slip pieces for the bottom"
2,PupSTEP is for pups,"Although this product is a good idea and lightweight, the description is misleading saying the steps will hold 120 lbs. I purchased it for a 60 lb. dog, however, it was too wobbly and unstable so I am returning it. I would judge the practical limit to be closer to 30 lbs. Also, because of how small the steps are, it is difficult for a medium to large dog to use (especially when the dog is not as nimble as he or she once was).That said, I would have given it 4 stars if the description was accurate and I had purchased it for a smaller dog. It is ideal for small, light weight dogs and folds nicely up to go under the bed."
4,GREAT STEPS FOR WEINERS,"The steps are working great for our two weiner doggies. They are a bit steep but after a couple of practice runs (with treats of course), they took to them with no problem. They are higher than the steps you have to assemble and much sturdier. Thanks for a nice product."
1,LOVE AMAZON - HATE SOLVIT PUPSTEP,I bought this for my Chihuahua. The steps are too narrow and steep for him. I also tried it with my Shih Tsu - he hates it too. The back panel support is poorly designed and the steps wobble under any weight. Solvit PupSTEP doesn't solve anything.
5,Doggy steps are great for cats too!,"My cat will be 15 in May 2010. She loves to snuggle up at bedtime. Her agility isn't as flexible, so these steps were a great purchase! I introduced her to using them by putting a treat on each step. She was a natural stair climber after that! The steps are shallow enough so she doesn't have to strain to reach each step. As an extra safety precaution, I added glow-in-the-dark tape at the edge of each step. I'm very happy with this purchase--highly recommended!"
3,Not for all dogs,"Bought these steps for our slightly overweight, older dog. He didn't take to them at all. He just couldn't get used to the plastic steps which scared him when he first tried them out. To be fair, we live in a one-story home and our dog isn't used to stairs. Still, I think they would have been ok if they were weren't so steep and narrow and if they were made of fabric instead of plastic. Overall, nice steps, easy to move around and I liked that you could fold and store them away under the bed. Just not for my dog."
4,bargain steps,Perfect for my mom's little terror and her super high bed/mattress! A bargain compared to others I've seen and the one we bought for our dog at home...
4,Great Stairs,"The stairs look very nice. The only reason why I didn't give it 5-star is that the stairs is light weighted so I have to hold it as my dog (English Bulldog, 53 lbs) climbs up or else she may fall off or the stairs may tip over. Other than that, it's a great stairs. It does what it's supposed to and helps my dog gets up and down from our bed. I think my mattress is 18"" (the kind with the pillow-top) and it was 1 step shorter than my mattress. If there were 5 steps, then the top of the 5th step would have been the same height as my mattress. This is still not a big problem because my dog can ""leap/jump"" a little from the top of the 4th step onto the bed. I would recommend this stairs to anyone. Having it defintely helps my dog with her bad legs."
3,Great for my elderly cat,"Due to its foldability and light weight, some reviewers find this to be too flimsy to hold up to its advertised weight limit. But as I bought this for my elderly cat, that is not an issue for me. I do wish it was a bit higher as it does not quite come up to my bed (one more step will do.)"
1,Too short & too small for Mini Schnauzer,"We bought this for our aging miniature schnauzer to get up to the bed. Unfortunately, it was way too short to even get her close to the top (about a foot too short and we don't have a very high bed!). Additionally, the steps were way too small for her to step on. She weighs just over 17 pounds but placing her on the steps, it felt like the steps were going to fall apart. On carpet, the steps were particularly wobbly. She hated the steps after using them only once or twice and refused to go near the Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs. I did like how the stairs folded up and this would be convenient. I think for a smaller dog- like the one pictured- it would work just fine but for a medium/small dog it's a little too small."
4,perfect for cats - my 10 pound dog not so much,the cats love the steps the 13 year old miniature fox terrier finds them diffcult to naigate - to steep I think. Glad we got it anyway - will get more as the cats age.
4,Good doggy stairs at a reasonable price!,"Do some research in locating similar stairs and you will find that some can be outrageously expensive. This one does the job nicely at a cost of under $40... We never take it down and our Maltese just climbs up the stairs and into the bed now. I never have to worry that he will be stuck in bed or that he will be injured trying to get back up or down the floor. Plus we don't have carpet to cushion their fall -- the stairs saves us time, worry and vet bills to repair any possible bone injuries! My only criticism is to have non-skid feets built into the product... those flimsy foam stickers just don't cut it."
5,SOLVIT pupSTEP,"THEY ARE JUST GREAT !!!!IT,S A PLEASURE TO GET AN ITEM THAT IS EXACTLY AS PICTURED AND ADVERTISED. !!!! NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED EXCEPT TO SNAP THE BACK TWO LEGS INTO POSITION, WHICH WAS EASY. A SIMPLE ITEM, LIGHT WEIGHT, EASY TO MOVE AND MY LITTLE DOG NOW THINKS SHE IS A PRINCESS . I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE WITH A SMALL AND SPOILED DG."
4,great for short legs!,it works great! perfect for my short legged older Chihuahua!he needed something closer together than the traditional 3 step kind.
4,It was as advertised,My only problem with it is that I can not get either of my two dogs to use it. They both seem afraid of it. I do not feel that this is due to any problem with the product.
5,stepping up,"Bought this for my son's cat who at times had difficulty getting up on his bed. His bed is high. Tried a chair, didn't work. So I thought of a stepper. All is good at my son's house now!"
2,Dogs hated it..,They would not use it at all. steps were to small for a medium dog. They would not use it.
4,Misleading dimensions,"I thought this product was 31"" high from reading the description on Amazon, but from floor to top step, measuring vertically, it is 19"". The 31"" measurement is the step distance on a slant from 1st step to top. Overall, I am very happy though. They are sturdy and do not move on my carpeting. I have 2 cats and one weighs 13 lbs. and he can use them without moving the steps. My cats love the spongy step pads and playing underneath the steps too. I would recommend to anyone that has a pet that needs a boost up on the bed or favorite chair. Good for my senior guy."
4,Compact and Sturdy,"I was impressed by it being so lightweight and easy to set up. Very sturdy. For a smaller dog, under 30 lbs, this would be a great step. The steps are narrow, so for my large dog, it will not work. Our dog no longer barks in the middle of night to be let up on bed. It was really easy to teach him to use. Less than 5 minutes and he was using it with ease. I will be ordering a second one soon."
4,I really like it but two of my dog don't!,"This was to meant replace a fleece covered pet stair that wasn't high enough for my dogs to jump on to a new super deep mattress. The height is right, the quality fine, but one of my two paps and my toy fox terrier refuse to use it. I've tried everything to coax them, but they just don't like it. Thinking of trying to cover it in old carpet to see if that would work. Any suggestions?It is sturdy and decent quality. Love the ability to fold it and stick it under the bed if a guest is going to see the room. Nice enough that I bought a second for my summer home as well.Come on paps, get on board!"
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"This DVD of A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL came with Dutch subtitles which are unremovable, a fact never mentioned in the Amazon listing; DaaVeeDee, the suppliers, insist that I pay to return it and accept a 20% penalty for unsealing it - how else to discover the subtitling problem; the suppliers have been quite aggressive in their email correspondence and, so far at least, Amazon has not been supportive.this is quite simply the worst experience i have ever had with an Amazon supplier, in fact my first total rip-off.Francis Muir"
3,"HP Quickdoc Station, Review","Quickdoc works fine; however it should have come with a separate AC adapter. Not having this defeats the purpose of having a docking station. Everytime you want to take your computer home from the office, you need to remember to pack up the AC adapter that came with the laptop. If you purchase this product, save yourself some hassle and get a universal AC adapter."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is the first time I have to say something bad about not only this product but also about how HP customer service handled my enquiries. I have been a very good HP customer but I just can't fathom why they would sell something without a power extension. I must have spent 6 hours between misdirected and dropped calls and numerous emails. My last attempt was to write to HP CEO which got me a ""scaling"" customer phone call. After a brief conversation, the guy simply dismissed my complain. Bottom line, why would you sell a docking station which purpose is to help you with not having to plug and unplug wires and have you plug and unplug a power cord, IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BAD DESIGN, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."
3,HP quick Doc,"The quick doc comes with absolutely no instructions. And, HP doesn't have any on their on-line technical manuals. Yes, the complaints you have heard about the product are true, you need to use the charger provided with your Notebook/laptop, there isn't one built into the Quickdoc.The thing I really hate is the fact that I cannot close the cover to my Notebook or the remote monitor and Notebook shut down. I have been trying to resolve this with HP product support but some instructions to begin with would have helped.Once I get this screen thing figured out and I can set my monitor on the notebook I guess it will be an Ok product. Not great, but Ok."
1,Is not compatible with dv7 laptops as advertized,In spite of stating that the Dock was compatible with the dv7 series of HP laptops it indeed was not.
4,Fashion sewing...,"This book is a comprehensive guide of techniques used for the complete assemble of garments. Easy to follow picture instructions and how to, from a stay stitch to tailoring techniques."
2,PA-7000 PRE AMP,"I got this unit and everyting was great. However when I tried to listen at low volume it keeps clicking and shutting off. Then if the music hits a loud part it comes back on. I have tried everything to get it to work right. Called factory customer support and he was OK to deal with...could of been better but he said it sounded like a short. So I ordered another one due to I really like the unit for the money. When I get the new one I will compare and hopefully the bad one then can be shipped back.Thank you,Duane........."
5,very pleased,"this video was extremely informative--i am not in the military or LE, but after working diligently on the techniques taught in this video, people now watch me when i'm at the shooting range and even ask me for tips on occasion. if i had to sum up what this video teaches, I would say that it teaches you how to be extremely safe, efficient, quick and accurate with a pistol. these skills come in handy if you are warrior by trade, or in my case just looking for self defense skills. granted, you can't just watch this video and then somehow become proficient with a pistol overnight--the video is meant to be paused after each section so that you can work on the exercises/drills taught in this video so you can ingrain the techniques into your muscle memory."
1,impractical drills and lessons for the real world,"I just finished watching the dvd a couple of weeks ago. I can't believe this is the Israeli method, considering that Israel has excellent tradition in combat. The emphasis on drawing an empty pistol ( almost everytime on the dvd)then presenting the pistol at eye level before charging or cocking could get you killed on real time. Combat is always about speed and accuracy and a fully loaded gun is imperative element in a gunfight. Also, clearing a house (more so a boat) is best done by professionals with sufficient back-up. Dont do this unless your family is in danger and time is of the essence before authorities arrived.Likewise, the instructions on clearing malfunctions is hard to master(especially level 3 and one hand reloading). Best to carry a BUG (back-up gun) easier and faster. The dvd is a waste of time viewing."
5,Best shooting course I've taken,"I took the actual course from Garret, and it was the most informative and comprehensive shooting course I've ever taken. I immediately came home and bought the DVD so I'd always have it on hand for refreshers.Every move is thought out and vital to survival. Of course, on a DVD you can't get the real life experience or the stress factor that you would have with a live class (which I recommend everyone take if you ever get the chance to study with this man), but it's a good enough close second.I use the principles I learned in the class and DVD to teach my own adult children how to shoot safely and effectively.This man is no joke. He knows his business and knows how to teach it. I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Britain britain britain,"this is a must...Educate yourselves, people! it's a great book about international/post domestic affairs. Mind you, this is a Political/Historical reference to understand brit-politics."
2,Dissapointed,"I figured for the price there would be more magnets in the set that what was shown. But no, what you see is what you get. Very disappointing."
1,Defective/Does not work properly,"The timer had the wrong color sand in the wrong glass, the orders were green, white, and brown at arrival. However, it should have been green, brown, and white.Not only the colors were in the wrong order, but the 3min and 4min obviously had the wrong amount of sand in it. (3min had more sand then the 4min)In conclusion, the product came all messed up. I never received such a horrible product that was all wrong in every way."
5,Awesome ...of course,"Kooll is awesome, i love the music...i hope you all check it out it is worth your time trust me!"
3,A good overview...,"Sandy's Finishing Touches is a step-by-step guide to finishing needlework projects, including pillows, stockings, hangings, ornaments, etc.! At 70 pages, the book is spiral bound with some illustrations.Don't buy it used - find it new at Nordic Needle."
1,So bad it's good!,"This movie is the ultimate in camp. It's so bad it's actually good. Most of the dialogue is so ludicrous and dated that you'll find yourself laughing at every other word uttered. Russ Meyer is, without question, the king of bad taste and bad girl films and those that like kitsch for the sake of kitsch will love this film. Mr. Meyer makes John Waters look like David Lean. The acting is as bad as it gets and the aforementioned dialogue, unbelievably catty and trite. Go-Go dancing in the middle of the desert, indeed. When was the last time anyone drove through the desert and saw three wild chicks in skintight jumpsuits hanging out by their roadsters doing the Watusi? Too, too much cheesy fun for words. Check it out; you won't believe your eyes and ears. This is sexploitation film making at it's vulgar and debasing best."
4,Innuedo Galore,"A fast-paced, ludicrously sexual film that will make you laugh at the sheer absurdity. Crazy, man!"
5,A movie way ahead of its time,"Although not his masterpiece, this is Meyer near his best. Though over thirty years old, this film stands up today with the best of them. It is a stylish and bizarre exploration into big-busted women who kick ass, but it is more than an exploration into high weirdness (though Lynch would be nothing without pioneers such as Meyer). Oddly enough Meyer's work here can be considered the first truly artistic film promoting feminism. Always being sly, behind the T&A shots and seeming self-indulgence, Meyer always portrays male characters as lusty, sniveling idiots, while the women are hip, progressives, with brains that almost match their bodies. Meyer is a true force in film, as he is among the first to impose the director or creator as a key element in the art of a film (something Allen is usually credited with). This is a milestone achievement in film, especially since the viewer is challenged to see its brilliance and must be tempted to cast it aside. -Chris Coffman"
3,Compact English language guide for Le Puy to Roncevalles,"Best used as a supplement to the Confraternity of St. James guides. I don't know of another compact guide to the Le Puy to Roncevalles part of the trip to Santiago. It's abbreviations such as L for left, R for right, etc. make it terse and not smooth reading, but it saves on total book size, and weight is important to the Camino walker. This is a 1999 guide, so now getting a little dated.Once you hit the border of Spain, more recent guides such as Davies and Cole's Walking the Camino de Santiago become available.On all parts of the Camino, if English is your first language, it is essential to get the corresponding Confraternity of St. James guide books. Do a web search on camino santiago or confraternity, or even backpack45 and they should pop up."
4,Walking the camino,"This book is the essential guide to walking the camino to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain. It is a factual guide and leads you from village to village. Very useful in that it charts shops, refugios and fountains for filling the water bottle. If you want to walk the camino from St Jean to Santiago de Compostela this is the book for you. As a walker you will be carrying everything you need in a rucksack, so you may need to copy the pages and throw them away as you walk, to lighten your load."
3,Works but unique smell,"I believe the product worked for me. I developed severe allergies to dust mites. I washed all our beddings, blankets, etc. in the detergent. My allergies were much better. But I will warn you, it does not have that pleasant fresh laundry smell after you are done. But it beats the allergic reactions!"
4,A good source for medical students and epidemiologists.,"This is a well written book that touches upon all basic areas of Epidemiology. A strong point of the book is its use of illustrations, they help keep the material somewhat interesting rather than bland full of text.It goes through plenty of examples to help you memorize concepts as well as give you practice of each chapter's readings by having review questions for that chapter.It is a good aid for medical students, epidemiologists as well as anyone involved in the related health services."
4,Great for the basics - but know what you need before buying.,"The Gordis text is excellent if you are a newcomer to clinical research and want to get your feet on the ground in a hurry. Explanations of basic epidemilogic concepts (prevalence, indcidence, odds and hazard ratios, sensitivities and specificities, basic study designs and limitations) are written in an easy-to-grasp manner, and the exercises at the end of each chapter ensure you are really able to put these concepts into practice. It is a quick and easy read, and will really give you a leg-up when you begin formal coursework.HOWEVER, if you are looking to learn about hypothesis testing, statistical tests, and how data are typically analyzed and presented at the end of clinical trials, this book will not help you. You will need a dedicated statistics book - for beginners like myself, the Douglas Altman text is a wonderful (albeit rigorous) supplement to this one."
2,Excruciatingly slow,"The writing is clear and easy to understand. If you work through the book, as others have mentioned, you will gain proficiency with the software.But I'm surprised no one has mentioned that this book moves incredibly slowly. This book is written for people who are relatively new to comptuers. But if you have some computer proficiency, the step-by-step exercises are consistently repetitious and mind-numbing."
3,Reading backwards..,"I haven't read the first book, but I enjoyed this book. I don't think they are comparable to my favorite movie, Steel Magnolias, but I did enjoy reading this book. Friendships are my favorite! I look forward to reading the first. The characters although enjoyable, they didn't have as much depth as I would like!"
5,A MASTERPIECE,ONE OF THE BEST BANDS TO COME OUT OF MICHIGAN. THE CD IS INCREDIBLE. THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD LIVE. CHECK THEM OUT
4,guitar case,"It's very big! Fits the guitar well as well as other paraphernalia. I do wish it was a tad smaller, but okay for me."
5,Best Case Ever,"This is the best case ever for the money! I have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the Gator Deluxe. I like this case so much, I plan to purchase two more this week."
5,I was hesitant...,"I hesitated as to order this case or not. I was fearful that my lefty Ibanez Gio wouldn't fit inside, but it fits like a glove and I'm glad I decided to order it! The case is very well made, but the key for the lock looks pretty cheap (could be picked quite easily), but I have no need to lock it anyway. My guitar measures 39 inches from the end of the body to the end of the headstock, in case anyone is wondering the length. It even fits with the shoulder strap attached to the guitar.I would recommend this case to anyone with a similar style guitar!Thanks Gator Cases, and Amazon for this wonderful product!"
2,"Not bad, not good","I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in this Gator case purchased locally. I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage. After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up. The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case. Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case. The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips. The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."
2,Modern Family 1,Disappointed. Other comedies are better. Should not have won the Emmy for Best Comedy in my opinion.
1,"Funny Show,Terrible Streaming Quality","I had free $5 credit so I thought I would try this out. I opted for the $1.99 standard version instead of $2.99 HD. It was a mistake. I thought the standard quality was going to be like Hulu. It was not. I would definitely recommend the HD version even if it costs more. If you put the regular version on full screen on the computer, it is completely distorted."
4,Gift to self and family,Great price. Could not resist buying my own Christmas present for the kids to give me since we all love to sit down and watch this show. Even my 3 year old quotes lines from season one. 9 and 11 year old discuss episodes with friends. So funny! Will watch over and over again.
5,Hilarious show,"We bought the first season of ""Modern Family"" since we had not previously watched this program. It is well written and very funny."
2,disappointment,"After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this show a try.What a disappointment. ""Modern Family"" is so politically correct that does not work out for me. Perhaps it works for a lot of people and I respect that. But not for me. And another (unfortunate) surprise was the number of cliches.Like I said, most likely, this comedy is very funny for a lot of people. In my case, I was really disappointed this time. I saw several episodes and I tried (believe me!) so much to enjoy the show. Unfortunately, after six episodes I just had to quit.Once again, if you are a fan of ""modern family"", good for you!I wanted so much to like this show..."
1,"great series, but dvd does not work from Amazon!","Was so happy to receive the dvd, but when I went to put it in and play it, it did not work at all! It said that this dvd was formatted for a different region!?!?! I have a multi zone dvd so it should have worked anyway! Figured it was just a fluke and ordered a replacement... same thing!!! Would highly recommend simply buying elsewhere. Amazon's price is great, but if you cannot watch it, it is not worth it! Amazon is good about replacements, and lets hope about refunds (since I am sending the replacement back today and requesting a refund). I have bought many things from them, including dvds, and this is the first time this has happened. I had also read another reviewer saying the exact same thing about buying Modern Family and decided to ignore and buy anyway... big mistake!"
2,Most overrated show I have ever seen,"I like the cast. I like the idea. I like some of the dialogue. I hate this show. It breaks the cardinal rule for comedy in that it never makes me laugh. Not once. And it tries so hard to be cute all the time. And the gay couple? They are the stereotypical gay couple and the worst part of the show. Week after week, I kept waiting for something funny to happen. Maybe the second season gets better. I don't know and will likely never find out. But this first season, at best, was mildly amusing. Never funny."
3,"Correcting ""A Student""","I haven't used this book, but need to correct the review by ""A Student.""The roots of the Republican Party are classical liberalism. I.e., the liberalism of John Locke; the liberalism that believes in individual property rights and free markets. We call Republicans conservatives, but the classical conservatives believed in a more rigid class system and distrusted free markets because they disrupt social orders.Perhaps ""A Student"" should have spent more time listening and less time complaining. He might have learned something.And that, in a nutshell, is the great difficulty in teaching political science. When teaching chemistry, students don't assume they already know everything. When teaching political science, some students are unable to learn because they are convinced they already know. It only happens with strong conservatives and strong liberals. God bless the moderates--they're the only ones with open minds."
3,Very laid back,"There has been an embarrasment of richs regarding The Four Seasons of late. There are three new versions worth looking at. To my mind this is the least of the three. The recording mix places the soloist far back and seems to favor the the very able Trondheim Soloists backing Ms. Mutter. Fine for background music, but few fireworks. Folks who love this music are strongly urged to look at Gil Sham's supberb new version on this same label and Giulano Carmignola's absolutely stunning version on the Sony Classical label. This latter may be one of the very finest classical recordings ever made."
2,Is this Vivaldi???,"I am annoyed at Anne-Sophie Mutter. Her new release on Deutsche Grammophon [289 463 259-2] There isn't much to say about the Vivaldi except that there's more performance than music. As for the packaging...well, it's silly. The packaging is bright, artsy and blatantly manipulative; it looks like more money was put into the CD cover and book than in the recording itself."
3,Warning! Grammatical error within!,"I ordered this book based on the excellent reviews, and indeed, my 9-month-old daughter loved the pictures (which are gorgeous). But I was so disappointed to find a grammatical error--and you have to rewrite the final rhyme yourself to get rid of it. OK, granted, so i'm a big word nerd. (I graduated from Harvard magna cum laude in English.) Most people won't even notice. And I'd have no problem if the book used non-standard grammar as an artistic choice (as in More More More, Said the Baby, a truly lovely book.) But this is just a lame mistake, and I'd prefer to keep this kind of sloppiness away from my daughter. Go ahead, call me a geek."
5,Very enjoyable,"I borrowed this book recently from my local library. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was very readible and entertaining, and included many previously unreleased ""tidbits."" Pete Shotton, one of Lennon's closest friends, presents a credible account and reveals Lennon the person: fun loving, rebelious and a general comedian. While John certainly did have flaws (i.e. he was the world's worst dancer and was not loyal to his first wife Cynthia), inclusion of these bits of information make Shotton's book all the more credible. Thus unlike the malicious Goldman book and unlike other books which appear too fawning, this book is objective and written by someone who really knew John before the madness of Beatlemania set in."
2,Help I need tape.,"I applied the tape according to the directions, but it would not stick for anything. I went out and bought double stick tape. They are making a fortune on simple 1ml. plastic sheet. I recommend people go somewhere else for this product if they do not have the perfect back East window."
3,Product didnt last the winter.,I have used other products like this and this one worked but only for about a month then it started falling.
5,get the multiple window kit for sure!,"This multiple window kit is the way to go and save. I was skeptical about having to cut it to size, however the way it is packaged it is folded over and cutting it off was simple. You only need to cut the width when determining the window size. The rest is extra. We put this stuff up to save money. Save even more by avoiding the made to size options. Cut it off to size and cut your heating bill!"
1,Not worth the effort,"Because I have lived in old houses in Wisconsin for most of my life, I have all-too-often been forced to rely on this product to try and help stop cold drafts on leaky windows. It's always rated as the best. But having put up this stuff dozens, if not hundreds of times, I can finally say: enough is enough. This stuff is absolutely useless junk. No matter what condition my window sills are in, the tape does not stick. It goes up nicely, the plastic stretches and seals to a crystal clear consistency....and within 72 hours, one or more corners of the tape gives way, bungles up in the wrap, and makes the whole effort useless. It has never lasted more than a week without patching or maintenance, which immediately reduces its seal and therefore its effectiveness. If this is the best stuff on the market, the market is simply a pile of junk. Just invest in new windows and save yourself the headache. This stuff will not help you."
3,It is alright.,"I followed the directions closely and can't really tell if the room is warmer as a result. Perhaps it is by a degree. Otherwise, a bit of a hassle to install without the help of a second person. Wouldn't recommend for really big windows but for it does the trick for a small one."
3,Meh,"It was easy to install and I did not have any difficulty in even hard to reach places. However, I'm not sure how well it works. I haven't really noticed a change in the room temperature and have had it up for months. I miss being able to open my windows whenever nice weather does come.I'm sure it's wonderful if you have a drafty window, which I apparently do not."
3,reduces drafts,"living in an old drafty house, these helped to reduce to bit to the chill in the air. very easy to install."
3,I still feel a draft,"I have these in my kids rooms, we rent & have terrible windows but it still gets rather cold in their room"
5,great product,this is a great product. it works as advertised. very easy to use and hard product to find in the stores.
5,Warm bedroom,"This is first time for me when I'm using this.I am impressed how effective this insulation kit is.Highly recommended especially for people renting the place,where with minimum investment you get great results.Anyone can install it.All you need is a scissors, a hair dryer and pacience.The downside of this however, is that you can't open the window.Not for me, but if you open that window often, this item is not for you.Find a different solution."
3,"After some practice, it works","I bought two packages of this product after seeing a video demo on youtube. I consider myself fairly handy around the house. Even after installing this product on 10 windows I would not say I'm very good at it. The install isn't nearly as easy as shown in the video.My advice - don't try to over tighten the product with your blow dryer. The tape will unstick. If it isn't really tight, you will see it but that's the trade off.I think this product is overpriced for what you get. It does work so if you can afford the learning curve, go for it."
1,Stuck In Grief,"I found the beginning of this book to be helpful, however, as I neared the half way point, I realized that the author was stuck in the deep mire of her grief. Although she was a psychologist, she was not able to move past the initial stage of grief due to her anger. At Heritage Oaks Memorial Chapel (Rocklin, CA), we provide counseling and resources to assist people with their journey of grief so they can move beyond the initial pain and anger to an appreciation of their loved one and enjoyment of the wonderful memories they hold in their heart. I'm glad to have read this book because it has motivated me to provide families with the support they need to move forward after losing someone they love deeply."
4,Haunting!,Loved it! SO different! Shakila's voice is stunning and the Persian songs are out of this world! Solvejg's Song is like a quartz crystal. Small downside: sometimes the techno is a bit overdone.ALL voices are angelic.
4,Tax Reform For Dummies,"""American tax code."" ""Tax reform."" Do these phrases make you cringe? Do you wish you understood what was happening with YOUR money? Are you sick of filling out 1040's? Then you should definitely read this book. McCaffery starts by showing where the current tax system has gone wrong, and then sets out an alternative system that is simpler and fairer. McCaffery is not a politician or accountant, not a Liberal or Conservative: he is a professor of Law and Economics and continuously calls for bipartisan compromises throughout this book.Is meaningful change really possible? I'll let Ed speak for himself: ""It's far better than what we have now. It's fair. It's worth fighting for. It's about time."""
3,Never Write a Memo You'll Regret,"This book merits a few stars, because its collection of aphorisms is ""half-good"" and ""half-right"". However, Moran's witty comments can shock the reader as much as amuse. Frequent references to the ""little people"" on the factory floor and the admonition to ""be nice to receptionists"" remind us that the author is part of an old-style middle-managerial clique, adept in the ways of kissing up to his superiors but possibly rather abusive to underlings. Also, the advice to be ""open"" to new technology and trends gives this book a terribly ""dated"" feel for something going all the way back to 1994."
1,Better Get The Extended Warranty!,"We bought 2 ENVISION 17"" flat panel monitors for work, from Comp USA. BAD MOVE! The first one smoked after 35 days, and Comp USA wont exchange it after 21 days. They said we should have gotten the extended warranty! Ha, not even 30 for these babys. The second one seems to be getting dim with almost 2 months of use. Dont waste your time, or your money."
2,2stars,This is not what I thought it would be about. They seem to be slaves that stood in for their masters.
5,Durability vs a crisis of confidence,"Most water control projects in this country rely on big gravity damns, but in the early 20th century one John S. Eastwood designed dams which minimized the amount of concrete involved. While his designs were less expensive, he faced much opposition from engineers and politicians alike who believed their more fragile appearance would damage public confidence in their durability. Donald Jackson provide insights into dam building history and describes how in this case the illusion of stability strengthened by concrete won over Eastwood's innovative design plans. A 'must' for any collection strong in engineering, conservation, and energy generating issues."
4,Can't stop eating these.,"These crisps are textured much like mini rice cakes, but without the carb hit. They seemed a little bland at first, but my taste buds warmed up to them nicely.I'll be buying them again."
3,Not worth $70.00,I bought this for my 8 year old son along with 2 other Godzilla Plush toys. I bought it because of the wings (my son is Autistic and he loves to flap the wings) and I was expecting something FABULOUS for the hefty price of [...]....WRONG! The other 2 plush toys combined were less than this one and they are much bigger! DO NOT BUY THIS...it is a good toy but it is WAY over priced.
1,Junk,Spend an extra buck or two and get one in Lowe's or Home Depot. This thing is as cheap as they come.
4,A very good Latin American Spanish course,"This seemed to work pretty well for me, for learning conversational Spanish for Latin America. My retention has been low for other programs, but this one worked better for me. Kept the CDs in the car and used them extensively while driving."
3,Pimsleur spanish - a caution,I bought Pimsleur spanish and was very dissapointed. It was an expensive mistake for me as I wanted to learn European Spanish and this version is aimed at a Latin audience. No mention was made of this. The american voices grate on european ears after a short while as the course is aimed at latin american not european Spanish. A waste of my money!
4,Haunting. The ending will stay with you for a long time.,"I read this novella after I saw the film on Bravo. As good as that was the book is a hundred times better. Uhlman depicts a beautiful friendship between to young men that is ravaged by the insane hatred that was so prevalent during the Third Reich. In such a short work Uhlman is able to create characters that are entirely fleshed out, entirely real. The ending is a killer. I highly recommend this title."
3,Anime R-Rated Soap Opera,"Some nudity and some sex scenes (on the high end of R rated, definitely not a kid's movie unless you know your kids know all about sex), but in general this is an anime soap opera, a romantic-triangle fling with the girl and her boy friend and her wanna-be lover and a girl she connects with. Lots of talk, lots of boy-and-girl meeting and discussing. Would appeal perhaps to people who enjoy soap operas and aren't adverse to the very occasional nude or sex. Action, humor, etc? Nope."
5,Please put this out on DVD,"I absolutely adore this movie, I'm just waiting for it to come out on DVD....PLEASE."
4,DVD please!,"I love both this movie and 'The Women'. Both are gorgeous to look at and entertaining besides. However, I wish that someone would either reissue this one on VHS (thereby making it so that normal people can buy it and not have to pay the inflated prices for used ones) or put it on DVD, which it deserves. AND if they could also, at the same time, make it widescreen. I so much hate full-screen versions of any movie."
5,Favorite Movie,"I enjoy watching this movie!! I really do think some of the movies from the 40's, 50's, and 60's are the best movies made. You can actually hear the people speak, clearly. The singing in this movie is good. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the classicis."
5,No way???????? Way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me start with two words- STRIDE RITE. The name automatically registers quality,durability, and buyer comfort. This company has been around forever it seems and they just keep getting better. They have kept their manufacturing integrity while trending with the times. These are terrific shoes. I can't imagine anyone not loving any shoe by these guys. This style has the great ability to keep a 5 year old ""fashionista"" stylin' and profilin' but allows her to play 'til she drops in comfort. Plus, I have no worries about her muffing up her shoes after a few weeks as kids tend to do with other brands."
3,Parih,"I foumd the book ""Parih"" Slow and pridicable pick it and read three pages put it down and come back to it in a week or so."
4,Pariah,"Very good mystery set in Aspen, CO.The author has an assembly of interesting characters. He is very good at describing in detail the characters and locations.Exciting throughout."
2,Rocking blues ...,"... but not at its best. Writing his own songs sure is a good thing, but I miss a little bit more originality while Jake plays guitar. The tone is okay - nicely distorted strat - but his solos are lacking emotion, the same goes for his voice. I like him better than many other young guns, but there is a way to go for the quality of - let's say Joe Bonamassa."
3,Estate Planning Light,"A generally good book providing a ""tree top"" view of estate planning. Short and entertaining, I found the book overpriced for its length and content."
3,Beautiful photography and some good decorating ideas!,"I really liked this book, but I would like to have seen more ""content"" ... Perhaps more detailed instructions on how projects were created. Also, there were some lovely descriptions of design elements of rooms that were not pictured. While the photographs were very artful and pretty, many did not fully show things that were described in the text. I felt this book demonstrated a unique style that was different from Rachel Ashwell's Shabby Chic style...but I think if you enjoyed the Shabby Chic books, you will enjoy this one too!"
3,About her work in Hollywood,"I bought this book because I was interested in how Teri is handling her life with MS/multiple sclerosis but it is barely mentioned in the book. Instead she talks a lot about her career and all the celebrities she has worked with (but not in a dishy, gossipy way). It's a little dated as her career was hottest in the 80s, so some of the actors she talks about, like Richard Dreyfuss, are not really in the news anymore. I liked her childhood memories the best. Her dad was a hard-drinking vaudeville actor and she started out living in North Hollywood in a little middle-class bungalow, taking ballet lessons and wanting to be a dancer. She always had a lot of drive and ambition, and is not really the ditzy character she often portrays in the movies. I thought she was too guarded about her love life (none of her marriages last but she doesn't explain why) and her illness (only mentioned at the back of the book)."
1,No Longer Supported,"Before you buy please check Planetwide site - you will see this application is no longer supported. I am not sure that you will be able to install it since it requires their servers to validate the authenticity. I have tried to re-install a version a bought a year ago on my new computer, but it won't install since it needs their servers and they are now offline."
2,on ebay is cheaper,"the price of this watch is very expensive on this site ,on ebay it is 375$ and it the same product"
5,Ignore the one star reviews,"Outstanding album, equal parts mid-period King Crimson and Shellac. Not technical metal really, nor trying to be. More the energy of a hardcore band with no interest in 2-minute verse-chorus-verse songs. Closer in spirit to Don Caballero or a razor-sharp meter-shifting Fugazi with a wider harmonic palate. ""Seal/Breaker/Void"" stands out."
4,Swank Tunes for Your Hi-Fi Lifestyle,"Here's a collection of breezy, jazzy arrangements featuring lots of, well.....handclapping! And a fair amount of fingersnapping, too. Henderson livens up these familiar tunes with great swinging arrangements for big band and throws in a bunch of sassy strings for good measure.It's not cutting edge, but Henderson's classy, upbeat style is still eminently enjoyable and great music for your next cocktail party. There's little of Henderson's work available on CD so get this classic from the golden age of Hi-Fi before it disappears."
4,Good brightness,"The trick here is to check your lumens. 750 is good. Sure these will save you money with CFL, but you need to make sure it's bright enough and this is."
4,"Does not work in dimmer. Burned out in one month. Otherwise, great product.","This product works well. It did turn on, but does not dim with the dimmer nob. After one month attached to the dimmer socket it quit working. I would recommend this product for use with a regular light switch. I wouldn't stray away from this product for normal purposes. It gives off even light and you can't tell there is a twirly CFL bulb inside. Just don't plug it into a dimmer socket."
1,Where's the techniques?,"I was very disappointed with the book. First of all, the book was small and I was able to read it from front to back in only a couple of hours. Which would be okay had it been jam packed with information or techniques - but it wasn't. In fact, there were only about 6 techniques involving arm bars or joint locks - definitely not what I expected from a book titled plenty pictures of the author with big names, and he does his fair share of name dropping, but as far as teaching the reader any techniques, forget about it. Oh, he does discuss his 12 ground positions (what he terms ""position flow""), but big deal - so I now know new names for 12 positions I already knew names for. What the reader is not told is what joint locks and submissions are available from these positions - which was the whole point in buying the book! So anyway, after reading over half the book, I was thrilled to see the chapter heading on page 101 - SUBMISSIONS. Guess what. The chapter ends on page 107."
1,Buy it if you like throwing your money away.,"I bought the book and read it from cover to cover. From a publishing stand point, the books pictures are cheaply printed into the book, making them hard to see. And, the quality of the pages are worse than a comic book. Contentwise, I was extremely disappointed. I have been involved in grappling for more than 13 years, so I think I have some idea of what I am talking about (though not enough to write a book). The book showed almost no techniques whatsoever."
5,Great Book!! A must for every martial artist!,I thought the book was written very well. The author is one who truly understands the martial arts and he is in the right direction when it comes to attaining perfection in self-defense skills. I would recommend Submission Wrestling to anyone who is eager to head down the reality path when it comes to martial arts!
1,horrible,"This book is definatley a waste of money. It does show a few moves(note the emphasis on the word FEW). I've heard people say that Fergy is just a conman. Well, he just might be. The bottom line, don't buy this book. If you want the best book on the market about submission wrestling and grappling, buy ""Fighter's Notebook: A Manual of Mixed Martial Arts"""
5,Great for a beginner wanting an introduction to grappling,I cannot agree with the reviewers who claimed this book teaches nothing. To the novice this is a great introduction to grappling and essential submissions.I have trained in Karate for 10 years and I found that I did learn the essential basics of grappling.Perhaps because the author is a Tae Kwon Do master he knows how to explain grappling to a fellow Stand Up fighter like myself.I am very glad I purchased this book. In fact last night I challenged one of my students to a wrsetling match and was able to armbar him from a technique I had learned in the book.
5,"A really, really neat book!",Taught me more in one chapter than I learned in 6 months of jiu jitsu classes and cost less than one class.
1,"This is a very disappointing ""novel.""","After reading Leddick's ""My Worst Date"" I bought ""The Sex Squad"" as soon as it was on the stands. I wasted my money. ""TSS"" is either a quick follow-up to a well written first novel or an earlier attempt the publishers thought they could now sell. Either way, it is a great disappointment of a cobbled together story. Sympathetic characters are lacking and there are no clear motivations for their actions. I lost interest before I was a quarter through the book, but kept plugging along hoping the story (such as it was) would improve. This was a vain hope. Do yourself a favor and re-read ""My Worst Date."""
3,"Not a great novel, but a fun read for opera/ballet fans","David Leddick's follow-up to ""My Worst Date"" represents a complete departure for him, a book that reads more like a series of non-fiction anecdotes than a conventional novel and mingles fictional characters with larger-than-life figures from the worlds of opera and ballet such as Maria Callas, Antony Tudor, Rudolf Bing, Zinka Milanov, et al. The results may well disappoint readers who are expecting ""My Second-Worst Date,"" but this book will be absolute catnip for operaphiles and balletomanes. It's hard to know where the author drew some of his inspiration for the alleged dirt he dishes on these divas and divos, aside from a confidence that you can't libel the dead, but on its own terms I found this a very engaging visit to a closed world that Leddick captures in vivid prose."
1,Can't use it,"I know it's my fault for not reading the system requirements, but who sells a product like this without making it compatible with the latest version of windows? I have Vista and Windows 7 and it wouldn't work on either."
4,Protective Guitar Case,"This is an excellent hard shell guitar case for use on airplanes, etc. The price makes for a good value and the case is well made with good attention to detail."
2,not much to this book,"I was excited to read the review of this book, but was overall disappointed with it. First - it was so small that I read it within 30 minutes. The quality of the paper was like sandpaper. The little stories/poems were a little interesting, but fell way short of actually being a ""book"". I feel it had potential, but could not recommend its purchase."
3,Much ado about Nothing.,"This was written in the style of John Buchan, who wrote ""The 39 Steps."" I like that old fashioned style of writing where the hero is out on his own walking or running about the countryside getting into and out of trouble. But the plot was almost nonexistant and apart from dropping a few Irish placenames the action could have taken place anywhere. He has not captured the Irish style of speech either and it jars on an Irishman's ear. But I have liked the authors other books so I bought this and I'm glad to have a first edition of his even though I do not collect books except to read."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!,"I love this movie! If you are a Utena fan, you will love it as well. It is hard to understand, especially for those who have not seen the entire anime series (ME!) but if you watch it a few times, you'll begin to see the symbolism, which is used a lot. It basically follows the story of Utena but in an alternate universe. The animation is gorgeous and the songs are beautiful. GET IT! I highly recomend it. NOT FOR CHILDREN. It contains lesbian themes, nudity and sexual situations."
2,Revolutionary Girl Utena The Movie,I rated this movie very poorly. It doesn't have much in common with the TV series verion. This movie is not suitable for childern to watch. Adult movie. Subject matter is more on the lisbian side. (No comment on that please) I do so like the TV series and would be interested in further series on this.Thank You for your time. I hope this helps others in the near future.Cartoon nut
5,One of the most amazing Movie I have seen.,"If you can take the oddness of the movie, and able to watch the movie couple more times, you will realize that this is one of the best most amazing movie you have ever seen.The Movie is a re-telling of the series in probably one of the most un-real way you can imagine.From the director of Sailor Moon, Utena Movie is the movie no one should miss."
2,There more going on then I noticed,"I watched and rewatched this movie, and to give a simple response would be, HUH? There are many jokes going on that refer to stuff I don't know. It is a movie that need to be discused in a poetry class, because everything seem to have a second meaning. I believe it is a movie that is design to make you think, but it didn't seem to work with me, I felt LAIN, Ghost in the Shell, and Akira are better movies to make you think.In short if you are a DBZ anime type fan, this is not worth your time, but if you like to watch a movie and think about everything that has happened you may enjoy."
4,What can I say; it's a dust bag!...,"The Fein Turbo I is much quieter than cheaper vacs of equivalent size. It is substantially better made as well. It's suction is quite powerful, but unfortunately the comparatively small (1 1/2""?) hose and tools clog easily, especially the round brush whose bristles have an annoying tendency to get tangled up with hair. The bags are easy to install, have decent capacity for a small machine (a gallon, maybe?), and are very effective in trapping even extremely fine dust. You won't be able to use this vac in place of a broom in your shop, but for careful cleaning - and keeping your hearing - it's, well, ""fein""."
3,Infectious,"I got this album after listening to their newer album, and it's not BAD, but it has a rougher quality than the other LP. That being said, my favorite BCM songs are on this album - China Lake, Outside Rochelle, and Full on the Lips, which is one of those songs you can't get out of your head once you've heard it (like Oops, I Did It Again, but much better, because, unlike Britney Spears, you don't mind having BCM songs running through your head). I think if you like their brand of music in general, sort of punk-y harder rock, this album will grow on you. Overall, it's a good first LP, but it lacks the cohesion of the newer album."
1,Not for PSE scrapbookers,I just got this as Christmas gift and am very disappointed because I was hoping I could use it with my PSE. Here are my main issues:1) it allows you to email your final work but it converts the project into an .avi file (movie file) with very poor quality. On top of that it includes advertisement of the software in your project. I was very disappointed because I spent a couple of hours making digital birthday party invitation and when I emailed to myself the result looked like a poor/cheap invitation with advertiments.2) all cliparts can only be used with their proprietary software. You cannot export them to other programs such as PSE or convert them into other formats like jpeg or bmp.
5,"A sequel to Wild Seed, though written earlier","I very much enjoyed this book, but I don't think it's Butler's best--if you haven't read anything by her, I would strongly recommend starting with Wild Seed--her style in that later book is stronger and the characters more richly developed. (Not to mention that it is set before Mind of My Mind, with some of the same characters, though written afterwards.) That said, I would certainly encourage people to read Mind of My Mind--and all of Butler's books. The many glowing reviews on Amazon.com are not mistaken."
2,Not their best flavor,"I bought a bag of these Apple Cinnamon Crunch flavor Genisoy Soy Crisps along with another flavor at my local store. I tried this flavor first. The first taste was promising, apple cinnamon-y (but a little powdery). However, as I chewed, the flavor disappeared quickly, and I was left with a very dry and slightly sour unpleasant experience in my mouth. Upon swallowing I was compelled to guzzle several ounces of water. A few days later, I tried them once again, and invited someone else to try them. That experience had sadly the same result. On a brighter note, I have really enjoyed the deep salt flavor of these crisps."
3,Cute,"I bought this toy for my son's class. The pieces are flexible and hold up very well. They are not too difficult for even my 3 1/2 year old to manipulate, so I think this toy is good for dexterity. I was disappointed that all the animals do not face the same direction. I though you could put them all together front and back. Some are actually solid colored and you can't match all the heads with all the bodies. I'm not sure why it was designed this way. Otherwise, it's a cute toy."
3,Good story...but a bit confusing.,"To be honest...I love Hitman. LOVE IT. I have gone so far as to purchase art from the series I love it that much. But this was the only story line I thought was just a little to convaluted. I was confused half the time reading this trying to figure out who is who, and what was going on. I have a feeling Garth was writing this from the heart because some of the language that the charecters use is hard to read (he uses alot of Irish Slang)...other than that...if you are a Fan...pick it up!"
1,ugh. what a hunk of junk.,"bad production, bad writing, bad interviews, no primary footage at all, few photos, annoying camera work, no story arc, lame ""silent movie"" type expository paragraphs, sycophants and hard line fans only... let's see, did i forget anything? oh yes, an out of tune piano that is poorly played throughout the ENTIRE MOVIE. crap on crap served with a side of crap."
3,Interesting but not a lot of autobiography,The condition of the film was below average and the content did not say a lot about Aimee McPherson. It was more about the history of the temple and those that fought to retain its original architecture/purpose.
1,Saving Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story,I was very disappointed in the legal debate at the end of the is DVD. I would not share this DVD with anyone.
2,No different,Haven't noticed any thing different since beginning these pills. Been taking 3 weeks now. Maybe it takes longer. Will update if things change.
1,Title is very misleading,"I bought this book thinking that there would be useful games and activities included that I could share with my students. Instead, I found out that it is a book about how to use algebra tiles. The book is very thick and wordy and I do not have the time to sort through it. I am giving it away without ever using it. This is not a practical or useful teaching tool. Do not waste your time or money."
5,The Bible of Microtechnique,"This book is a must for anyone serious about microtechnique. It has been the definitive text in this field for almost 25 years. Chapters on fixing, parrafin embedding, microtomy and staining are particularly enlightening. Although the book is not up-to-date on some of the more recent techniques (e.g. computerized image analysis), it is nevertheless the standard by which all other texts must be judged. Highly recommended."
2,Pass,"Just finished watching this movie. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't ""feel"" for this movie as some of Godard's other works like Breathless, weekend, and Bande A part. It is horribly disjointed to the point of being unwatchable and the characters are boring, cliched and one-dimensional.Jean-Pierre Léaud was far more watchable in Masculin, Feminin. Recommend only for diehard Godard fans, maybe."
3,Dreamgirls are Beautiful,"This CD is a perfect example of what musical theater is/should be. The CD let the listener understand who the characters are and what happening. You can feel the emotion throughout this CD. That being said, you don't necessarily get any of the songs stuck in your head, because these songs are so much more than just songs in this musical. Almost all the voices are fantastic. The music is somewhat in a Motown style so if that's not your thing, this probably isn't your thing either. Other than that I think this is a great CD for all musical theater fans, and this special edition version has extra tracks, sing along tracks, and a remix, so you can't go wrong getting this version. Definitely on for collectors, and some more listened musical fans. Favorite song: ""And I Am Telling You"""
4,Great but...,"This is a solidly built, heavy duty receiver with one major issue that may or may not be a common problem with this type of product. The arms that have the pre-drilled holes, which must align with the frame for the mounting bolts, are canted in. I'm going to guess that it's due to heat generated by the welding process or maybe poor attention to workmanship. Either way it was quite a struggle, a two man, many heavy-duty clamp and loads of sweat and abusive language sort of struggle.Once accomplished though, it's definitely a bomb-proof beast."
2,Terrible,"The only saving grace for this movie/miniseries was the guy who played ""Gus"".I thought he did a really bang up job.I have not read McMurtry's books bcs I could never get through them. IMHO they were awful.But Lonesone Dove was one of those miniseries that can't be beat.Those actors were what made Dove one of the best westerns ever.They are just hurrying through everything to give us a cheap look at what came before And I have no desire to ever watch it again.And for what it's worth: my rancher/cowboying husband who adores Dove hated Comanche Moon."
1,very unhappy,I placed my order on March16 as of today April 19 I still have not received the movie I ordered and no customer service to help get my order straightened out the last activity on the tracking number was March 25 I would really like to watch this movie and add it to my collection
4,sick of you,"Im so sick of all your review's ya its not as good as lonesome dove but everone knows that you dont have to say that anymore its been well over a decade just stop stating the obvious. i know you all say this mini series in historically incorect well whatever as long as larry mcmurty has something to do with it i dont care. Im not usually one to make a review but you people piss me off. I thought all the characters acted similar to how they should.You people are so stupid ""Its to bad to add to my collection"" I have over 700 vhs , you guys act like you have 3 movies that you think are really great but apparently you probably dont have a collection to add anything to. i will happily add this one to my lonesome dove collection. I wish the rest of you would stop critiqueing and live."
5,Comanche Moon: It's Own Movie,"When I first saw ""Comanche Moon,"" I too compared it to ""Lonesome Dove,"" (in my opinion, one of, if not the best Western movie ever made). But watching it since, I've learned to watch it for what it is as it's own movie, trying not to compare the actors in ""Moon"" with those in ""Dove."" You know what? It's a pretty damn good cowboy movie."
4,Comanchee Moon,I am a collector of the Lonesome Dove series and this is a welcome addition. Enjoy seeing the men as they develope into the stars of Lonesome Dove. To bad the actors could not be in each of the prequels. Keeping up with the characters from each show can become confusing.
2,Not a very good movie,I really love Lonesome Dove. This particular movie was not a very good movie. I would not purchase it again.
5,Excellent Prelude to Lonesome Dove,"Although there will never be a western that will match Lonesome Dove, this movie is a great prelude to it. Like Lonesome Dove, Commanche Moon is true to the novel. As the movie progresses, the Guss and Call characters do a nice job of developing until they ultimately pick up the mannerisms and voice inflections of these characters. It beats all of the others that have followed the original movie."
2,hhhmmm...,"After years of enjoying the Vibratex Queen, I was ready for a new 'rabbit style' vibe. I did a lot of research and finally settled on the Pearl Thunder. When I received it, it looked like fun...bigger than the Queen with tracked pearls and a light in the shaft for whatever reason, I was eager to try it out.The results were at best, disappointing. Unlike the Queen, the upper vibrator just didn't hit the right places. It also wasn't as powerful and by the time I was done messing with it, I was numb. Another bad point is that all of the websites that offer this vibe tell a different story about what it is made out of. I never had trouble with the Queen's vinyl and really liked the feel of it but Pearl Thunder is just jelly and I am allergic to jelly so I was left burning, itching and uncomfortable. Not to mention...no orgasm in sight.It might work for other people but it wasn't set right for me."
1,Waste of Money,"Not only is the idea of having a DVD player and VCR bundled in one neat package space-saving, but it should also be money-saving. For the price of this Samsung DVD/VCR combo, though, you can buy a Samsung VCR and a DVD player seperately that are of higher quality. The Samsung VR8160 4 Head Hi-Fi VCR is praised by reviewers for its ease-of-use and great picture quality, while the VCR in this pack is considered simply subpar by most. Along with that, you can get the Samsung DVD-N501 Nuon DVD/HDCD Player, which is not only better than the faulty (understatement) DVD player in this package, but most other DVD players as well. It plays DVD's, CD's, MP3's, Nuon games, and has many more features. Walk away from this 'deal' and all other current VCR/DVD combos, because all you'll find are lower quality products for higher prices. See for yourself."
2,annoying...and returned,"Needed a new VCR (the 14 year-old player died) and figured a combo unit would replace both VCR and CD player with added DVD capability. Stylish silver unit, relatively easy to hook up. So far, so good. Unfortunately the VCR side makes audible motor noise that becomes quite annoying during quiet dialogue. So I had to pull it all apart to take it back. Instead of exchanging, though, we're returning because of an annoying design feature. When the DVD/CD is on, the unit just reads PLAY. To see track and time one must dig the remote out of the sofa and hit the DISPLAY button. This is fine...except after a few seconds the unit goes back to PLAY again! A minor thing, but buyer beware. We're not audio/videophiles, but simple conveniences are important. If you like to know where you're at on the CD, consider another option."
4,satisfied,This product has some good features. It was much easier to program for future recordings than either of the two Sonys or the Toshiba we have owned. I have to remove DVD's before using other features and have had to turn everything off and back on before my tv would work properly after I took out the DVD. I love the excellent quality of the DVD's but I've never had another player to compare. The VCR is great at regular speed but less so when it's put at 6 hr recording. I think it's as good a quality as the other more expensive VCR's we have owned.
2,Not long lasting.,"We purchased our combo about 1 year ago. The price was outstanding being that you get both the dvd and vcr. Well, it now won't play the dvd's. The company has offered to fix it for a ""nice"" fee, which turned out to be more than we paid. So needless to so we will now have a combo piece and a seperate DVD player. Not so convienant anymore."
1,Great idea,"A VCR/DVD player combo is a great idea and most stores are sold out of them. However I have had nothing but problems with my Samsung. The DVD player locks up and won't let me access the menu on some of my DVD's and therefore forced to watch some movies with subtitles and not able to skip chapters. If you want the advice from someone who ownes one, my advice is, if you are going to spend the money up grade. I wish I would have spent the extra money to get a better top of the line model."
4,"Nice looking unit, excellent combo","I've owned the Samsung DVD-V1000 for about two weeks and it has worked great, I have mine hooked up to a receiver and the sound is very good, my video tapes/DVD's have never looked better. When I purchased the unit I had a couple questions regarding connections and when I called Samsung customer service the advisor helped me out a lot, it's probably the best customer experience help that I have received on a electronics product, I was very impressed. I haven't had any of the problems with my unit to speak of. I originally purchased an APEX DVD player and had problems with lots of ""skips"" during action scenes, the Samsung DVD-V1000 plays those scenes with ease. I highly recommend this product, just read you instructions and learn to live with the remote (it's a little confusing at first)."
3,quality fine; ease of use --eh,"The picture quality of the DVD and VCR are nice but trying to figure out how to record from the TV to a VCR tape has been challenging. The instructions assume you know their terminology for viewing different options so I looked on their website, and the website freezes my computer. I can't say I have been thrilled with my purchase but for just watching a movie, it's fine."
5,Very Good,It took care my ac problem on the Lexus. It work very good I need that part. I replace the part myself it like new now !
1,Don't waste your money!,"First off, there are only 43 pages of book here. Then 29 lined pages for you to make notes. And I noticed several errors that should have been noticed by any proofreader who speaks English. It's just not worth the price. Action, Ability, and Awareness. That sums up the book. Look them up in the dictionary and save your money for a book that has some substance.P.S. Sorry, but typos and errors in a 43-page book is ridiculous. I know authors are human, but a professional publishing company should be able to publish a book without obvious errors---that's why they have proofreaders. It's not a totally useless book, it has some good points and is written with humor, it's just not a lot of material for the money."
5,What you always knew but never thought about,This is a great book to help you realize your greatest potential. Most people go about trying to get ahead in life using other people's ways of doing things. Joshua's book helps you stop and think for yourself about where you want to go.Its not like other self hlp books that tell you what you should be doing; instead this helps you listen to yourself and lets you figure out how to help yourself.I definately recommend this book!
3,Cute but the ending could be better,"On the whole i enjoyed this book. It's another nice, light, holiday read. I havent read any of Katie Fforde other books but would definately consider doing so in the future. The story is enjoyable if predictable and my favorite character has to be Imelda the cat!. I found however the ending didn't quite fit in with the rest of the book and there are some loose ends that could of been tied up."
3,Good only for Halloween,"It's nice for the price, and it matches perfectly the description. It closes with a ribbon, it doesn't have slits for the arms, and it's perfect to complete a costume for Halloween.However, if you are looking for something with a little more quality, don't buy this. The inside is not lined; it isn't even of the same fabric as the outside. If you will be wearing a nice or elaborate costume, it will look cheap by comparison."
2,disappointed,The lowest security setting works but take a lot longer to load web pages. The encrypted and anonymous settings dont work at all.
1,I dint receive this productyet,I received the other two products that i purchased apart fron this one. Why? Kindly give me feedback. ThanksTeresa
1,save your money,"i've just gotten into the MIZANI hair products, as i've just returned to a natural state of being for my locks. and i love the other MIZANI products and suspected that i'd love this one. NOT! after using this moisturizer once, i will NOT be using it again. it made no difference at all on my hair. my shampoo left my hair softer and more manageable!! now, it may be that this was a dud supply, but i'm definitely going to stay with organic root stimulator olive oil's reconstructing moisturizer. MUCH better results, DEPENDABLE results. if fact - i'm wondering why i left it at all?"
5,Light Work,"This book is about Light Work. Yes, This book does tell you about Doreen's early years as a Christian Scientist. However, I would not say that it promotes any religion. It promotes love and the readers desire to change their circumstances using Gods love to heal their lives. It offers readers the opportunity to learn how to embrace God as God embraces you. It also teaches the reader how to send healing energy to others and the earth via light work (prayers). Have and open mind and open heart and have a great day:) BLessings"
4,Good,"Well, the book is good, as all Doreen's books. But I gave it 4 starts because , first 52 percent of it was her life story , which was interesting, but I thought its little bit too long. I kept asking myself "" what's the point? When will she get to the point?"". Finally she got to the lightworkers, but her attention was to the special psychic abilities lightworkers posses. Well, I personally haven't s seeing a single person who can see ghosts, talk to the angels. Doesn't mean that it's not possible, but what about lightworkers who are not magical? Who just have love inside and strong desire to help people? To give service to the people? Yeah....exactly....I didn't find much help. In her Angles books she called a Lightworker anyone who desires to save the world, to do good things. Not just magical creatures.So, the book is worth reading anyway, just not much helpful to me."
5,understanding the power of healing,very educational... totally speaks to your heart..we learn through experiences of others and ourselves.Doreen has put some of her experiences in this book and she also gives tools so we can have our own and recognize them awesome!
1,Trite. Boring. Poorly written.,"I can't believe I read this whole book. I'm willing to overlook questionable writing style and structure for a suspense novel. This book asks you to put up with terrible writing while wading through a terrible plot with terrible characters. At one point, the main character is held at gunpoint by someone she loves while she's couched over the dead body of someone else she loved. The sentence that follows: 'She felt betrayed and angry.' Oh reeeeaaaalllly? Save yourself time and frustration. Skip it."
4,Great story line! But never fully explained certain details.,I was just recently introduced to Mrs. Gardner's book. The other Daughter is the second one I've read so far. I loved the plot the story line with all the twist and turns. It made for a very interesting read. At times I couldn't put it down. I think the only down fall was the ending. It was a little tough to swallow. I don't want to give anything away; but some things just did not make sense. why would so many people go along with such a messed up plan? And it was never explained how much Patricia really knew. Anyway Mrs. Gardner is a good author I'm looking forward to reading some of her other books.
5,"Spellbounding, excellent, suspence","I could not put this book down. Just about the time I thought I had the killer figured out, here comes another twist. I am in process of ordering her first book, if it is anything like this one, I will also take it to the Muny when I go just to finish it. I could not put it down, it went everywhere with me until i finished it."
4,The Other Daughter,"I was intrigued throughout the book. I had a difficult time putting down this story. The many twists in the plot kept me guessing until the end. For a second attempt at suspense I would say ""very well done!"" I am looking forward to future novels by the same author."
1,Plot holes you could drive a semi through,"the premise was fresh--outstanding, in fact--but did not deliver. ms. Gardner failed to ever explain how a little girl conveniently ""forgot"" the first nine years of her life OR how a mother failed to recognize her daughter, even five years later (what - no birthmarks, no moles, no mannerisms?) Shame on lisa and Bantam for ""slipping one by"" on readers!"
3,Harlequin Romance Anyone????,"Wow, I must say I was quite underwhelmed with this one. I've read several of her books and found them to be fast-paced with believable characters. The characters in this book were so icky--for lack of a better word--with about as much substance as paper dolls. Dime store novel at best."
2,Not her best,"I'm glad I read Lisa Gardner's more recent books first because I would have never believed that the same person wrote this book. Gardner certainly has come a long way with her writing. Melanie is an overdramatic, slightly hysteric romance novel heroine (not surprising since Gardner started out writing romances). The supporting characters are two dimensional and the dialogue is just over the top at times. While I usually read Gardner's books quickly, this one was hard to get through.The characters in Gardner's recent books are more highly developed and believable as is the dialogue and plot. I don't think I will be reading any more of her early books."
2,I wish I liked this one!,"I really wanted to like this book. I love Lisa Gardner's DD Warren series and suggest you read the books in that series over this book. Her DD Warren series is just so much better...the characters are more interesting, the plot twists are fascinating, and there's just a little romance sprinkled in with the mystery. I felt like this book read like an old Silhouette romance and the heroine was really weak and hard to like.I just read ""Touch and Go"" and it was another winner.I've switched to another author until Lisa Gardner's next book comes out."
5,Book Review,I am presently doing a study on how the Hyper-Calvinists/Ultra Calvinists believe for a class I teach. This book was informative on the five points of Calvinism.
4,Nice investment,"This is a very nice investment for the Palm. I recently bought it at Amazon and I really don't think I can find a shield like this that can beat the price. It's quite hard to stick on the Palm, but after that, you'll never be scared of scratches on your screen. Just think, buy a shield now and don't wait for your Palm to need a replacement screen that will cost hundreds. This is definitely a must-buy."
4,Like it a lot,"This bag is the perfect size for going to the gym and for going to the swimming pool-you can comfortably fit running shoes and equipment. The wet/dry pocket really keeps the inside dry. I only wish it had an extra pocket on the inside for cell phone/keys, etc."
3,Nice bag but ripped in a couple of weeks,"I really like this bag. It's just the right size, light, and holds all my things. However, the inside ripped within a couple of weeks. I've sent the bag in for a return and I am about to purchase a replacement."
3,Very Functional,"This was a great buy for me as I swim a lot in addition to my normal workout. I can put my wet stuff in the compartment in the side and it lets everything else stay dry. I could have used a little more room overall, but the price isn't bad for the size."
5,Sports Bag,"Great bag for any use. It's got plenty of space for all your stuff. It has 2 Zipper Compartments on the sides & a small pocket on the outside that will hold papers, keys, or whatever it's an awesome product. It aslo has a shoulder strap that detacthes or 2 handles that have a velcrow closure to carry it."
4,It's a musician's gig bag!,"I've been using this bag since Dec 2008, and it's great. I'm a bass guitar player, and this is exactly what I needed to carry cables, effects pedals, towels, batteries, clothespins (you can never have too many clothespins), a compact stand for my bass, a music stand... And there's still room to throw in a spare t-shirt or a change of shoes!"
4,interesting read,I have not quite finished the book but am enjoying it. I do like Robert Whitlow's work. It is different from his other work I have read.
4,Light and Dark,"Jimmy is another well written Whitlow novel that I would recommend. Although not always fast paced, the overall story is interesting. The ending was certainly not what I expected. Whitlow's blending of Christian theology with tragedy has a way of turning even the dark side of life into happiness and a bright future."
3,Cute costume,This costume was pretty cute although no one knew who my daughter was dressed as until I painted her face green and she put on the bright red princess fiona wig. The wig does not come with the costume just a headband with ogre ears.
5,Priceless Vocals,Dale Ann Bradley is an American treasure. The harmony vocals and instrumental prowess of the other lady bandmembers is icing on the cake. This is one highly recommended Bluegrass CD.
4,Outstanding.,"This book is one of the best history books I have read. I'm not a Marine, nor have I served in any of the armed forces, so I began reading the retired colonel's book with a skeptical eye, wary of Corps propaganda. However, Millett's objectivism and professionalism are evident throughout this rhetoric-free, diligently-researched, amazingly-thorough, and entertaining volume. I particularly enjoyed his characterizations of the various commandants. I only hope that Dr. Millett sees fit to revise and expand the book in a few more years."
3,"A Nice Sampler, But. . .","Although this is a nice enough sampler it has now been overshadowed by the two-disc ""Uncanned."" I suspect that this is still in print because of its price. This is the CD version of the original LP that came out circa 1970. Caution--This set contains the abbreviated version of ""On The Road Again"" that was released as a single in 1968."
3,"Learned, but . . .","The book's title is misleading. This book in fact constitutes a lengthy though rather unsystematic primer on the basics of Orthodox Christian doctrine, with some emphasis on matters related to sexual ethics. Prof. Engelhardt is obviously very intelligent, and there's lots of information in the book, most of it (insofar as I'm able to judge) accurate. There are many interesting quotes. However, Prof. Engelhardt's style is blunt and graceless. Further, Prof. Engelhardt lacks the nuanced judgment that an historian needs, and his Orthodox-convert's triumphalism is annoying. It's hard to imagine this book's being used as a bioethics text anywhere, with the possible exception of Orthodox seminaries."
2,poor quality recording?,"The content is great, but the images break up periodically as though it's not a good quality recording. If a good quality recording is available we would appreciate a replacement. Thank you!"
3,WIDER LONGER but NOT FOR FLAT FEET,"Oh how I wanted these luscious looking slides.Roomy toe, even a half size longer and wider than they are sized.But the problem is the arch.We flat footed folks put a lot of weight on the inside edge of our feet, the arch area, where weight does not belong.Given that despite the wonderful cushioning it is still hard as a rock beneath that layer and with weight on it, it hurts.Plain and simple not for those of us with pes planus.If your foot does not roll in, then these should be divine!Not pretty though not even in the silver color. A very EARTH SHOE looking utilitarian shoe."
1,It's useless,"I try It to run device with 25w, but doesn't work. The fuse was break. How they say it's 100w and doesn't able to run 25w."
4,Usefulnes of Power Bright Transformer,"Although I have not yet had the occasion to use it, I like the fact that one can use this transformer to change the voltage both ways: 120 to 220 and vice versa"
3,Return item,"Hello,The transformer is a great piece of kit but unfortunately it is not strong enough for what I need it for, so I have to return it.SorryThanks for your timeRegardsArline Steadman"
3,volt trans,not being from an electrical background I mistakenly bought this item. I should have bought a higher rated item [ for the likes of a juicer etc ]
4,Great YA Paranormal Read,"Suze can do more than just see ghosts. She's a mediator with the task of helping ghosts cross over. When she moves to California, she hopes to start fresh without the ""crazy"" stigma she has because of her talent (or curse as she sees it). Meg Cabot takes her easy reading style and creates a fun paranormal adventure. I loved Suze's New York attitude that makes her the next ""IT"" girl in her new NOrthern California home."
4,Shadowland... Are you a good ghost or a bad ghost?,"Shadowland's a good book. It starts out and ends good, in fact, i went out and bought the rest of the series when i was done reading it. The only problem with it is the fact that one in while it gets a little unbelievable; she such a touchy chick, so tough and a little fake. but besides that it's good.it's about a girl who can talk to, see and touch ghost and well...kick their butts. sometime they can get violent, like the ghost chick haunting thier school..."
5,all time fav,"meg cabot is my favorite author but when i read about this book i was like ""uhh is this really by her? it seems soooo boring!!"" but i was sooooooooooooooo wrong!! this book brilliant!! and all time wicked!!! read this book in an all nighter evening and crashed til one the next day. totally worth the sleepiness! this book rules and was super funny, sweet and kept you on the tip of you chair the entire time.enjoy!!-Cleopatra (again)"
5,Essential reading for all parents,For any parent who wants to break the controlling style of discipline that creates so many problems and weakens relationships. Naomi suggests such a refreshingly simple way of keeping a loving connection with children through communication. Highly recommended.
1,please help me with the fraudster,"I read this book when my son was born and paid for phone counselling with Dr. Naomi Aldort. Although I had a feeling that something was rotten I told myself that she must be right because she is an experienced psychologist with a Ph.D. I followed her advice and almost died from total exhaustion. To this day I have not recovered, I have to pay enormous medical bills and Dr. Aldort has not kept her promise to refund the money if one doesn't get value out of a session. I live in France; can you help me how I can get my money back?"
5,Positive discipline,"Excellent read, worth owning, can be reread w o being bored, tells u what TO do as well. Also great for teachers, family and child care workers."
5,an incredible and insightful book!,"I have read and re-read this book. I am sure I will continue to reach for it as I continue on my mothering journey. I find Aldort's approach to be helpful, authentic and compassionate. She is concerned with helping parents find healthy and genuine connection with their children. I give this book to every pregnant mom I know and recommend it highly. Unlike most ""how to"" parenting books, this one gets to the heart of the matter- how to connect with ourselves and our children. How to transform your internal script away from fear and toward real love. Please, please, please read this book and heed it's wisdom! You and your children deserve that!"
3,Not written in a very engaging manor,"This book is useful for having a lot of Aesop fables in one place. However the wording of the fables is not very engaging, I spice up my reading a little to keep my child interested in the story. The lessons are so timeless, I want her to remember them, but these aren't written in a manor that engages children. The illustrations are great though!"
2,The clip breaks off easily,"This product is well-designed and fits the Siemens phone perfectly, making it easy to store and retrieve.However, the clip breaks off too easily in a way that cannot be repaired, so forcing you to buy a new one. Luckily, it's cheap, but annoying nonetheless."
2,"""This Book Was So-So!!!!!!!","I was disappointed this time around. I'm still a true fan of Ms. Jackson, always will be, but I don't know, I just couldn't get with this novel. Netherland was working my nerves BIG TIME, and whenever there was a problem of some kind, either a Madaris or a friend of the family knew what to do or had connections. Ms. Jackson your plotlines are similar in quite a few of your novels. Why can't some of your players have middle class jobs? Everybody is rich, the men make all the decisions, everybody falls in love at the drop of a hat, or the women give the men hell before doing so, and why does the women have to be pregnant by the time the novel ends? Like I said, I'm a true blue fan Ms.Jackson,but come on now.....please don't get boring on me!!!!!!"
3,Another Madaris friends story,"Although some parts of the storyline may be unrealistic, I still enjoyed the book...I love catching up with all the Madaris family and friends...."
2,Great Sound Quality - No Rewind Button,"I was a novice to the digital voice recorder industry when I bought my DS30. I thought it would be a good replacement for my Dictaphone, however, nothing in the product description warned me that common features found on tape recorders, like fast forward, rewind and the ability to record over a section are considered ""advanced"" and ""advanced professional"" features. For those entering the digital voice recording arena beware, if the product description does not say the voice recorder has ""advanced"" features like rewind, fast forward, overwrite and/or insert, it doesn't."
2,Not for Mac users,"I bought the DS-30 in part because of the Olympus reputation for compatibility with Mac operating systems and because, in addition to offering folders for voice recordings, it had folders for downloading audible and podcasting files. Turns out: Nah. If you have a Mac (OS X), you're out of luck. They wrote no code to handle that. Something they did not bother to mention on their DS-30 page. And apparently they have no plans to change that, or they might have actually responded to my (snail-mailed) inquiry.If you use OS X, half of this equipment will be inoperable. Look elsewhere."
1,Dark said I this book was...,"I find it very annoying to have to read dialog like this. Add to the fact that the story line is dark, cruel and boring and a tired take off from the rest of this enjoyable series. Really not a good read, don't waste your money."
5,My all time favorite,I loved her the first time I heart her sing - I was about 10 - her music will always be cherished by me!
5,My mother loves this CD!!,"What can I say? The Cd arrived new in original packaging, a great stocking stuffer for the 'young at heart' in your family."
4,Great for EVERY artist!,"This was a very good book. It was very helpful to me and I've learned a lot of valuable info of this book. It tells you how to express force and form and how to use rhythm. Its is a lot of information to comperhend but just read and focus. I defiantly suggest this as a good read for any one interested and serous about art.note: I know a issue I sometimes have a habit to skim through an art book and say ""Wow these images are all sketchy and not my type of art this won't help me!"", you know, judging the book by its cover in a literal sense. At first you may get this assumption with this book, but DON'T! Reading it you will realize there're is A LOT of great information stored in the pages with techniques shadowed by famous Disney animators (as you comment ""that doesn't look like Disney!?""....EXACTLY) this book will be useful to ANY artist. From realistic to anime!"
1,not a good clock,"I bought this for the flashlight feature. You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on. Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on. The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long."
2,can't expect much from a cheap alarm clock,"cheap is good. it works but the display has to be put on and inverted angle to be able to read it.I had to return the first one because it couldn't be set. couldn't set the time, date or anything.try another one before getting this one."

5,A Former Student's Opinion,"As a former student of Susan Gubar, I would have to recommend this book to anyone interested in a deeper understading of the novels covered and also finding a different perspective to the traditional critical approaches. As a groundbreaking work, this collection critically looks at and analyzes many different aspects approaching the anxiety of female authorship. This work is truly interesting, and to all of the naysayers, I can vouch that the authors are have a very compelling and informed perspective. The second edition proves that it is a work that will be around for a very long time and that the work will not fall into obscurity, for it is a inspired work of literary criticism. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks a deeper look into the popular women novelists."
5,It's GOLD Jerry! GOLD!,"I too have the set and found them to be worth ten times their price. I, however, am neither a Limit player making the jump to NLHE nor am I a beginner. For a beginner, this is pretty advanced. However, that being said, I strongly recommend that you buy the set before it goes out of print and the price skyrockets.As my NLHE experience matured, I have gravitated to the cash games and make more from them now than tournaments. If you have aspirations of being a pro or a semi-pro, do yourself a favor and make this investment. It will pay large dividends eventually.Tru dat."
3,portable reading light / flashlight,"This is a cool little light. It's brighter than a lot of small lights, but doesn't get hot. If being used for a reading light you'll go through a lot of batteries, though. Nice for a flashlight since it folds up, but can also be used free-standing by flipping the base out. The emergency red flashing light quit working fairly early on."
1,Well up to the standard of all Rising Sun Productions. Terrible!,"As a professional reviewer of martial arts DVDs/videos for Classical Fighting Arts magazine, my advice would be to keep your money in your pocket. Production quality is at the lower end of the amateur market-the JKA or Kawasoe series and the ""All Kata of Shotokan Karate"" series by the same author, are far better quality for up to 70% less money!"
1,BEWARE!!! Unauthorized recording! Poorly mastered!,"I will get straight to the point: The CD is a poorly mastered, unauthorized recording of the original Carmen Jones cast recording using ancient recordings of the original 78 records. Pearl Records did not, repeat DID NOT receive Decca Broadway's permission to make this recording. However, Decca Broadway DID remaster FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTERS OF ""CARMEN JONES"" which sounds 100 times better than this thing and includes liner notes and pictures! Purchase the Decca Broadway recording instead. Frankly, this recording should rot!"
5,This is all you need to pass TExES Content EC-4 test!,"I purchased this book shortly before taking the TExES Content Area Test (EC-4) and I passed it the first time! This book summarizes all the information needed to pass the test. Best of all, the book gives you sample questions and then explains why each answer is correct or incorrect... teaching you how to answer the test questions successfully. This book is a Must!"
4,Worth it,This book explained everything on the test in detail and was easy to understand. I recommend getting the Cliff's Test Prep too because of the practice tests (this one did not have any but was definetly worth the money). Passed the test my first try.
3,"tried it and it works ,but not well.","I bought this product and tried it . it did not work very well for me , I can not recommend this product at all . if you want to learn to play the only thing i can think of to tell you is to get course from online or better yet take lessons and practice, practice, practice ."
3,night blooming jasmine from Hirt's,"Arrived in the last several months, packaged well, and alive, however with yellow leaves. After nursing it for awhile, without it getting better, I took it to a local nursery, where I learned that it had bugs. Since then I have been treating it with special soap, to no avail. Finally, I called Hirt's, was instructed to email them pictures, did that, and we'll see what happens."
2,this is my favorite type of jasmine/But plant is not thriving.,"I have grown Night Blooming jasmine many time. But from local nurseries, These 2 small plants arrived well shipped, but started dropping leaves and then I water lightly to evenly moisten the soil and more leaves dropped off after 2 more days.....I am disappointed"
1,No flowers or buds,"I ordered this plan about 21/2 months ago. Since then I have taken good care of the plant and following the instructions. However I have yet to see a single flower/bud on it. For the steep price that I paid for this plant I expected better results. Moreover, the size of the plant was really small.Not satisfied. Wouldn't buy from the same company again."
3,This is good for a beginner.,"But, don't expect to be made an apprentice to the writer. He will tell you to go from point A to point B. He'll even tell you why that is important and how avoiding this trip from A to B will be detrimental with a reason why. But, don't expect the author to actually guide you there with real life examples that lead you how to do it.If you know nothing about writing, this book will give you the basics. Only expect to get something of substance from a book like ""Characters & Viewpoint"" by Orson Scott Card. Now, THAT is a book worthy of anyone's attention, pro or beginner."
4,nice!,"Very nice looking silky finish. First table shipped was damaged, but the company quickly sent a replacement table. Easy to put together. This table set has a removable center leaf so it can be converted to a smaller circle table if necessary or to save space."
2,Poor packaging,"This product is not packaged appropriately for mail shipment. The bath salts leaked out of the packaging (all over my front walk and foyer). I can't comment on the product itself, because there was nothing left in the packaging."
2,Bad,"The 3D in the movie was very clean and very well done. But that was the only good thing about the movie. The story well sucked, the acting was worse, and the sound stage was not there. The whole movie budget got used up in the 3D"
3,"excellent 3d , average horror movie.","Most 3d movies are generally about depth and maybe they add a few scenes to pop out at you. This movie was actually shot in native 3d and the 3d is EXCELLENT. Although it's not about popping out at you mostly , it's about depth mainly, still many 3d flicks were shot in 2d and then processed and will never look as good as this one does, other than a few titles , this is TRUE 3D. The movie which was shot on a low budget (ohter than the 3d) in California , is a average haunted house movie , and it's actually alot better than most asylum titles! (the company that made this one). The acting is decent and the story is standard , but the added bonus of having a true 3d picture is good enough reason for fans of 3d to own this , I am a fan of low budget horror too so this is a good purchase for me on that level too."
1,Horrible!,"I was so looking forward to this set of games and was excited to get it. But after 3 days, I am ready to throw it in the trash. There are so many bugs in it that it is totally ridiculous! I especially notice it in Yahtzee. You touch one dice on the screen, and something else on the other side reacts, or else you get 2 or 3 reacting instead of just one. Or you touch something at the bottom for scoring and something totally different fills in! Then it doesn't credit you with the bonus when you get multiple Yahtzees. The other games aren't quite as bad, but things are screwed up in them as well. For most of them, I can't even get in without having to touch the screen several times to get it to react, and then it's only right 2/3 of the time.I can't even get any support on Atari's site because the game isn't on there yet. I'm left with calling a toll number, which I haven't done yet. Hopefully something can be done."
3,A nice western TV movie for 1974,"In a time period when Gunsmoke was in its swan song, this made for TV movie from Danny Thomas's company apart from Aaron Spelling was a sight for sore eyes. The former boy preacher, Marjoe Gortner, puts on a command performer paying homage to his former persona. Slim Pickens does justice as a black patch buddy from his old days. This film will not bore you for one instant as it moves along well from beginning to finish."
4,Hard driving bluegrass,"This CD warms you with the wonderful title cut, and brings you on a great bluegrass jouney. I didnt care much for River of Tears and Quit While I'm behind, but Leaving Gatesville, Sooner or Later, and the bluesy finale of You must Come in at the Door, are all wonderful songs. I give it a definite rerecommendation."
4,More of a movie than a book,"I saw the movie first, and for once the movie was better than the book. Ok, so the book was based on the movie which explains alot. I bought this book because I really loved the movie. However, there was something lacking in the book. I felt that there needed to be more connections between the reader and the characters. In other words, I wanted to care about them more, get to know them more in a way you only can in a book, not in a movie. However, it never quite gets there, it feels like you are just watching the movie.As I said, I really enjoyed the movie, so this book was ok. There was just something missing."
1,This is not really a book,"It's a sales come-on for Ted Warren's old stock market service. Somebody had the nerve to sell this as a book. That said, it's interesting, but get Ted's book instead."
1,not happy,"Nordic ware is great stuff, but the size of this plate is for munchkins....its so small that you cant even get a decent meal in the small dividers....go with something cheap and disposable."
2,Not worth the money,"I do not know how I made the mistake of thinking I was buying a set of 3. Perhaps I was looking at a similar product. At any rate, I like the divided dinner plate but it is not worth the $13 I paid for it. It ought to be about half that price...."
5,great mic stand for a tiny space,"I ordered this for my tiny closet-cum-voiceover recording booth, and am really pleased with it. It was well packaged and arrived promptly in great condition. The base is just 10"" diameter and takes up less than half the floor space of a standard tripod. That means I can put the stand up against the back wall and gain more sound-insulated space around it, which is just what I needed. My Rode NT1-A mic shock mount screws directly into the top fitting - no problems with the thread. The stand is nice and stable, but not too heavy to carry around when necessary. The only change I would make to the product is to include assembly instructions. Okay, I know it's a simple piece of kit, but not everybody has the confidence to start pulling something apart to find out how it works!"
1,Not Original Recordings,"Just to address the previous reviews, most of the recordings ARE by the original artists but not the original hit recordings. A few are very good but this set is not worth purchasing as the majority are not worth even listening to."
5,Pioneer CD-IU50 cable USB IpodInterface,"Muy bueno el producto, excelente vendedores lo recomiendo 100% a la comunidad de AMAZON.COM. Muy puntuales en el envió."
5,Great Coasters,"I really love these coasters. They are well made and worth the money. I already have two sets which I purchased at a local store for $7 more. These coasters don't ""sweat"" on the bottom. The rubber tracks really keep drinks in place. Super product."
5,Really Classy Coaster Set,"When I imbibe in my nightly drink of the moments' pleasure, I want to set the class down on something sturdy that will not shift or spill. This coaster set is perfect for stability and your glass will not slide off. With it's stainless steel framework it has a very classy look to it.Jay Adler"
1,Kindle edition,This Elizabeth Chadwick must not be the Elizabeth Chadwick of England whose books I really like and thought I was purchasing when I bought this book. I found the book boring and very slow in its movement of the action.
5,Ear plugs,They are awesome. I work in an Arena and it can be quite loud so these ear plugs work and they are quite comfy!
2,ASUS WL-520GU Wireless Router,"The router has many configurible features and is rather easy to setup. During the two months of ownership, it had to be rebooted a couple of times. It failed completely after two months of runing on my network UPS"
3,Not what I expected,"Ordered this DVD as informative material on the ""park"" and the ""trails"" however, talked more about envioronmental issues and geology of the park---but not very helpful for the purpose of travel education/information."
4,National Geographic - Great Overview of Glacier Nat'l. Park,"I suppose seeing Glacier National Park in high definition is the next best thing to being there. This was a very good video that covered a number of interesting topics. I learned firsthand that Glacier is a hiker's paradise. The park's glaciers are in fast retreat, but the landscape is still magnificent and stunning. See the National Geographic blu ray and then visit the park!"
3,Some discs skip,I really liked the season one disks until I got to the last disk. The last episode on disk 3 had some skipping in it. I removed the disk and examined it for dirt and obvious damage. The disk was totally clean. So I think that disk has a bad transfer. I'll be watching them in sequence to look for more. The few drop outs in disk 3 season 1 is not too bad but if more skip I'll be returning them.
2,ncis 1-8,"NCIS: Seasons 1-8When I received the product, the outer plastic was already torn off. However, there was an extra season 8 (3 dvd bundle)...Now i worried that the dvds are pirated or something or have been tampered with...and it was supposed to be a christmas gift for my daughter. Now $154.00 for a really special christmas gift is down the drain because i and wondering now if they will even work right."
2,NCIS season 1-8,"The show itself is great, however, the discs are not. Season 1 had two discs labeled wrong so we watched the shows out of order. Disc 1, 2 and 5 have subtitles that we cannot find a way to stop. Subtitles are distracting so that you read the words vs watching the show. Season 5 disc 1, the video and audio skips, we missed half the dialog, disappointing. I like the show so I am going to try to get the bad discs replaced. Not sure if anything is wrong with seasons 6-8."
5,Encountering the New Testament/ A Super Study Tool,I found this book a very good resource in my study. I would highly recomend it to anyone who wants to understand the New Testament better!
3,No eReader edition!!!,"Great textbook! But where are the eReader versions? Would love to be able to read on Kindle, Nook, iPad, etc.While the CD Rom of the textbook does allow you to read the textbook on your PC, you can't read it on a Mac. I contacted the publisher and confirmed that this is the case.This is a great publisher and great authors/editors so I encourage you to get a copy of this book. I realize that textbook manufacturer's have their reasons too, but it's time to find a way to make digital textbooks work for those who are willing to pay for them."
3,Soso,"I am looking for a true fresh cut grass sent I was given some bath salts from my niece that were grass sented and I loved them. So relaxing to me, I haven't been able to find a candle as of yet that capture the sent correctly"
1,will not fit,I have a Hitachi vm-h100la camera and the battery pictured here will not fit. It does not look like the battery in my camera.
2,Simple story,"I was most disappointed with this story. It held my interest, page to page, but only because I kept expecting something more, greater to happen. It wasn't good enough. A ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" repeat storyline with a dolphin, instead.Simply written, it can be a child's book - and maybe that is who the author was targeting?"
5,ENLIGHTENED,"The only way I can explain the wisdom in this book is ""Enlightened"". The author must be enlightened to tackle the most difficult problems of life and give us such concise answers and easy to follow directions."
2,Not good if you need long reliable connection,"The concept is really good. Simple and easy to use configuration GUI. But from the reviews that I've read, and from my own personal experience, the QA is poor on this product. If you get a good one, it will work, but then again you could get one which will quit after three hours of operation. Mine worked for a couple of hours, then slowly, the performance started degrading (packet loss), until after three hours, it was completely inoperable. And it took me four hours of debugging the network to make sure that the problem was not with my setup. Definitely I won't recommend it for professional/ business setups."
2,Looks like it could work....,"But it doesn't!!Looks well made, good install program and options to tweak it. Unfortunately, I tried everything I could, and it would never find my Linksys wireless G network... I could control it from an ethernet cable, ping it, should work! I already have a wireless G bridge that works quite well, but this one... Looks like you have 50/50 odds for it to work, when yo uknow that the latest firmware release was in 2003, it's a shame for Linksys quality procedures...Plus it's still pricey for a wireless B, I'm disappointed with Linksys..."
1,"When a Linksys product doesn't work, you are out of luck","I bought a wireless G router from Linksys in October, and still have not gotten it to work. The unit did not come with an installation CD (which was listed on the package), and I was told ""You can buy one if you want"". Countless emails, faxes, calls, and letters to both tech support and corporate, have gotten me nowhere. ""We will send you the CD immediately"". Never happens. ""We are so sorry, and will make this right"". Never happens. When I asked for an RMA, I was told ""I think an RMA has something to do with returning the product"". I will never EVER buy a Linksys product again."
5,Perfect fo the PS2,I have this hooked up to my Linksys BEFW11S4 and they work great together. It's connected to my PS2. Now I'm playing games with people in countries I can't even spell. A good Linksys product.
4,"Good product, setup a bit of a pain","I initially tried to use the setup application that came on the CD with this, but never got it to work. Eventually, I used the web based admin utility and set it up myself. I would have given it 5 start if the setup utility worked, but people without experience setting up a wireless system might have trouble.I have it running with 128 bit WEP encryption, and MAC address filtering with no problems."
4,WET11 not good at AppleTalk,"Works well, but not good at AppleTalk for those usingit on a Mac. Maybe they fix this in a future firmware revision."
4,Does the job,"I bought a WET11v2 with 2.08 firmware. I cannot speak for the WET11v1, but v2 has been good to me. Configured it in 15 minutes and it has worked great since. The WET11 is usually sold for slightly more than Netgear's competing ME101, but that extra $10 buys you a huge advantage: a fully functional working product. With the ME101, you save a few dollars and get a neutered Yugo. If you need a 802.11b bridge, the WET11 is the best choice."
4,"Great Basketball Drill book, Ode to cover of Detlef Schrmepf, one of top 75 NBA players of alltime!","[Four of Four stars] George Karl and TerryStotts do very good work here. The diagramsare easy to follow and the funky Tueton onthe cover is Detlef Schrempf, former 16-yr.NBA Forward/Guard. Detlef in german is 'Der-rick' and 'Schrempf' is short [and he was 6'10""!]"
2,Campy and silly,"I bought this because my brother plays the man with the killer son.It is pretty corny. I suppose it could become one of those classic camp movies, like Night of the Living dead."
2,Not so great,This watch has a really nice face but the band is quite flimsy I was disappointed. I would have sent it back but was too lazy.
4,Ernest Tubb Fan,"I purchased this as a gift and the person I bought it for likes it. I like both ""The Osborne Brothers"" and Ernest Tubbs."
2,RESURFACING IS FOR ROADS,"While I've used a number of facial exfoliants with good results, I've never experienced the stinging or redness that occurred with this product. My skin is not sensitive and tolerates scrubs, peels, and masks extremely well.The back of the tube says to leave on for ten minutes - impossible! It also reads for skin rejuvenation - don't think so.I'd read some good things about the Marini line, and thought I'd give it a try. But, the results were disappointing."
3,"It's ok, but...","I'm a veteran player of UO, but it's nice to have reference materials around. This guide is pretty good. But I keep finding places where I wish it went just a bit further.It gives information about tradeskills, but doesn't give you the practical walkthrough on how to actually use them. It has spell lists, but not the details on how exactly they work and how best to use them. It's not ""hands on"" enough for a complete beginning, but it's not detailed enough for a veteran.It does have a pretty complete set of maps, but these are all available online through the UO Automap (which is included in the game CD thesedays). It does have the usual reference materials--what ingredients you need for what.I guess I'd recommend buying it, at least if you have enough disposable income to not be concerned about it. But if you have one thing you can get with your [money] this week, this wouldn't be my choice."
1,Drivel,"poorly written and characters were very one-dimensional...if women want to be shallow, superficial and vain beings, catered to by blind, adoring males, then this is the book for you"
4,excellent translations,"As a german reader I must say that the author had made excellent translations. You have the feeling that he translated with heart - very rich in his speech and sometimes surprising. Some verses of Hoelderlin, which are strange and not easy to understand are in his translations clearer and simpler to understand. "" But it is the sea / That takes and gives remembrance, / And love no less keeps eyes attentively fixed, / But what is lasting the poets provide"" (Remembrance)."
4,Pretty much does what it claims to,What can I say it worked. The user interface was slightly confusing but not really that bad. ;)
5,I've tried them all...this is the best,"I've tried most, if not all of the competing products. This one is by far the most reliable and easiest to use. In fact, it's the only one of these products that hasn't caused me to lose anything, EVER. Highly recommended."
5,One of the greatest,look its an old game its not gonna be the best graphics but it does have some great gameplay .if youre not a born genius then the difficulty is ok. it is just like the board game and thats what makes it great. and yes it does work on xp.
5,Everything you wanted to know about the NFL and then some!,I really enjoyed seeing this book on Amazon - it's very exciting! Good luck hockey fans!
4,Great Classic!!,"This one was during the Bill Watts era of WCW. While the ""top rope DQ rule"" sucked, the matches themselves were excellent!! It is a classic and is worth the money."
5,This book is a delight!,"As an administrator of a very diverse school and mother of a college freshman, I found this book warmly expresses the commonality of all our experiences."
3,paint smells soo bad,My father in law bought this table for my daughter's christmas present but... the paint smells soo bad we had to put it outside... right now it is standing on our deck... hoping the smell will go away soon....
2,Cute but Crappy Strap,I only had this bag for two weeks before the strap broke. I'm learning that this is a common problem and there seems to be no way to get in contact with the company for a replacement strap.
3,A little out dated,It is a good book and helpful but you have to keep in mind it was writen about the time the first power meter came out so it has been a while. There are newer books with more up todate information. I'll keep it on my book shelf but won't use it much.
4,"Adequate text, lots of pictures","This French overview of homosexuality dates from 1964, and is therefore sadly out of date, but the text is inclusive and adequate. There are a lot of pictures, many of them frankly erotic. There are a lot of pictures of lesbians, apparently intended to encourage heterosexual men to buy the book."
5,Thank You!!,"This album has brought me so much joy, not to mention relaxing moments! These days it is difficult to find time just to relax, but now I make time and Karen's music is an integral part of that. I now look forward to setting aside some time just for me! So many of my favorites are included on this album and Karen brings such beauty to each and every one. From the theme to Ice Castles to Bewitched (I'm a Doris Day fan) and of course Somewhere Over The Rainbow, each time I listen to this cd the troubles of the day just don't seem all that big and important any more. Suddenly my mood is lifted and I find myself smiling and humming to myself for the rest of the day! Thank you for this wonderful collection of some of the best music I have ever heard, and the gift of some calm, peaceful and relaxing moments just for me!"
2,What SAP BW version ???,"Nowhere in the book, nor on Amazon detailed info nor in the ""view pages inside"" is mentioned that the book treats BW 2.0 and IS NOT GOOD for BW 3.1 or later.I had to read all the buyers reviews and to find out about the BW version, only after I had the book ordered and sent to me. So Because I use 3.2 I have sent back this book. It's not up-to-date, there seems not to be a reprint for BW 3.0So it was not useful to me. I am very disappointed.The book can show you some tasks to do in BW 2.0 but it learns you nothing if you have other cubes to make in different SAP applications.Also, it does not mention the transaction names behind the screens printed. Pitty, since this could have helped us when working in BW 3.0 (screens and menus can change but often the TX's remain the same)..."
1,Old Version,This book is published in 2002 sometime. So the concepts are for the version3.5 or less. The Current version is 7.0 and above. The book is good enough till version3.5 but not for 7.0 and above.SAP(R) BW: A Step-by-Step Guide
1,Step by Step guide to where?,"Anybody buying this book to learn some BW will be very much disappointed. Like the way the book is organised but older stuff. I can't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book. Not only they should stop selling, also should recall the book."
1,A total Let Down,"Sorry People but this dvd sucks, and I love Rick.. But this is like watching a root canal take place. it falls flat in every way you can imagine. I wish I had kept my money..."
5,Best one yet,"Victoria did it again, but I think this has to be the best book to date. I didnt know whether to shake my head at Jasmine or root for her to get everything her heart desired. This is my favorite VCM book yet!"
1,Not so pleased,All of the vials that i received were only half full...and most did not smell that great- Would not purchase vials for a price ever again-
5,jesse stone: a refreshing change,"sea change, 4th in the jesse stone series, is as good as the previousmovies. tom selleck makes it a pleasure to watch.i've read robert b. parkers book version, and i like the movie versionbetter. you should read the book, after you've watched the video and seewhat i mean. 5 stars. i hope there's more in the series, if he writesmore jesse stone."
1,Unhappy with this aerator,"After installing this aerator, water shot out of the sides. I tried 4 times, but with no luck. I even tightened it with pliers, but water still came out of the sides. Also, the water is not aerated. It was as if no aerator was installed. I put my old aerator back on."
4,Clever Teapot,This is a great teapot. Simple but pleasing design. The insert lets you control infusion process with no muss and no fuss. Clever and useful.
4,It really works,"This product is great and really is waterproof, much better than the sprays. Please make sure you heat your item first, it melts into the product and seals. All spray cans are in the garbage! lol"
2,Average,"These shirts are thinner than Fruit of the Loom, they shrink and they have a scratchy feel after washing."
3,Good enough for its time.,"In the pre-Fischer time, this book was good. I read it about 15 yrs ago, and have had quite a few fairy tales to tell friends. But now looking back, I don't understand why those ""nice"" stories got into the books. Don't get me wrong; those stories have great value, high quality, and very interesting; are very good for magazine. But they are the leading sections for the real chess following? However, if they don't get into this book or similar Chernev's books, then where would they be ever appeared in book forms? How many chess books about the chess prodigy, chess computer, and chess stuff that we thought we could read some good games from those books and got none at all? At least this one provided some games. The real chess part is very very good. The part about famous chess games, great endgame, chess problems, and more are very exceptional. 3 1/2 stars for this book: 2 1/2 for the chess part, 1 for the none-game part. Sometimes we have to raise our expectation."
1,Looks good at first but doesn't perform,"Bought this for a trip to Costa Rica-It was ok at first, could've been brighter, a little heavy. What makes it a bad deal is a week after I got back I turned it on and it lit up then dimmed-took it apart, put in new batteries, now it doesn't work at all...read something similar in other reviews. Also bought the smaller Neiko-it worked better and much lighter."
2,Works when it wants to,"There seems to be a reoccurring theme with these reviews - this product is very unreliable. The flash light does not always make a connection with the battery so the it flickers a lot. Also, my flash light came with 1 led that did not work. I'll have to open this thing up to figure out the problem. Save your $$ and get something else. I got the Super Brite 9 led flash light and it's just as bright, cheaper, and very reliable."
1,Didn't work right out of the box!,"I ordered this flashlight because it had so many good reviews. BIG mistake on my part. It arrived today and I just opened it and put batteries in it and guess what, it's useless. A firefly lights up a bigger area than this thing does. It is so dim that I had to go into a pitch black room to tell that it was even on. A complete waste of money. I wish I could have seen the packaging before I ordered it. Bad English is usually a dead giveaway that the item is an inferior product."
2,LED flashlight - disappointed,"Obviously this flashlight does not have LED's as bright as some available. I have used some with 7-9 LED's that are brighter. That'll teach me to do more research before I buy. It's ok, but some cheaper (by $10) will do as well or better job."
3,Longevity not its best quality,"I bought two of these flashlights for my girls to take to camp. They don't get much use. After about a year, I had to take the battery holder out and lightly sand the oxidation off of the tip in order to get it to stay lit. After the second year, the switch is also flakey. You have to turn it on/off about 3 times before it will stay lit. I'm used to whacking flashlights to get them to work, but was hoping for better. They flashlights have always been stored indoors. Time to try another brand."
3,Fun but...,"This flashlight is very bright and sturdily built, but after about a week it started flickering."
1,Junk,"I ordered this to put in my bedside table and since it was on sale... but after sitting here messing with it, putting in the batteries every which a way but loose, the thing still won't come on. Guess I'll chunk it in the trash since the return isn't worth my time. Amazon instead of selling junk just send the stuff back to the supplier and keep your good reputation!"
2,Chemicals..............,"If you've ever wondered what it would feel like to down half a chemistry lab, then you should definitely give this drink a shot. The taste is very metallic to the point of making you a little light headed. Not the best tasting RTD out there. I'd go with either Muscle Milk Light, or the Vextar Triple Chocolate Smoothie... good stuff!"
4,Unexpected and compelling.,"I bought this book on the basis of the EW review, but found the story structure very different from what I expected based on that review. The prose is spare and terse to the point of emaciation, but the author still manages to communicate characters and scenarios in sufficient detail to keep the reader involved. My only complaint is that I, as the reader, was as fascinated with Sarah as Merec and Jeremy were and would have liked to have known so much more about her--who she had been, who she became, where she went--that I felt just the slightest bit of dissatisfaction with the book's lack of exposition. Other than that, though, I found the book remarkably unpredictable (well, except for the bit about Jeremy) and entertaining."
2,"Interesting premise, weak execution","The premise of this book is very compelling...I can't think of any other very similar books out there. However, I just couldn't believe the characters here...it felt like the author didn't really know her own characters - and she created them - so how could the reader understand their thoughts and motivations. The Sarah Shepherd character was so all over the place - not only was she not at all believeable but she seemed like about 5 different people. In some novels that might be a strength, but here i think it was just poor writing. The book was also written for the lowest common demoninator reader...written like the reader had no attention span. The author obviously is creative and has great story ideas, but she'd be wise to spend some more time working on her execution before her next novel."
3,First chapter the best and very worth reading,"The reviews of this book I feel are a touch overrated. The premise of this book is great and, truth be told, the first chapter is absolutely terrific and has altered how i strive to communicate with my spouse. With each succeeding chapter however I found the anecdotes used to illustrate the book's points to be more and more glib and poorly illustrative. The final chapter which discusses Freedom and Intimacy I unfortunately felt sold the idea of marriage pretty short. The anecdotes used to illustrate their ideas in this final chapter I found either a) did not prove their point well or b) were hard to believe and disturbing in their degree of self absorbed behavior (i.e. kyle and susan--- which I can only hope were not being held up as models of behavior we should be striving for). Improving the illustrative anecdotes in this book would better serve the underlying themes the author is trying to promote which are very valuable."
2,badly packaged,item was suppose to be like new by the time i got it it was crushed and in ok contion at best
2,Very dum game,"This is the worst MX game period. firt off the racing mode is decent, but the freestyle mode is terrible it is almost impossible to perform the cool tricks if you want eye popping tricks please get SSX Tricky or Freakstyle."
2,Not A Great Racer.,"This game is full of bugs and poorly designed animations which get irritating after a few minutes of playing. When you get the hang of it, its not a bad game, but when you wipe-out there are long annoying sequences with the rider hanging inexplicably in mid-air or suddenly becoming transparent (!)The game engine seems very close to the snowboarding game 'SSX Tricky', which I would highly recommend as it is flawless in gameplay and design, plus faster and more satisfying!"
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. As with many other products, Lexmark didn't update the printer drivers to be completely compatible with Windows Vista. Can only print & nothing else. No longer an all-in-one. A waste of money."
4,A lot better than Road to Wrestle Mania for GBA.,"This is without a shadow of a doubt the best wrestling game ever for GBA. This has every Organization from WWF,WCW,ECW,FMW,NJPW,AJPW,UFC,M-Pro and a lot more. It has almost every wrestler from U.S.A.'s Stone Cold Steve Austin,The Rock,Rob Van Dam,The Undertaker,Hulk Hogan,Goldberg to Japan's Great Muta,Jushin Lyger,Tiger Mask,Great Sesuke,Yuji Nagata,Hayabusa,Ultimo Dragon and a hell of a lot more. One new feature is a Biography section that is a key to help you to identify the wrestlers because they are given fake names because of copyright issues. To unlock all the hidden guys got to the EDIT menu, select EDIT SuperstarGo to the name entryOn the first line type ALLon the line below type WRESTLERSon the line next to it type CLEARED.All of the hidden wrestlers should now be unlocked."
1,Not what it purports to be,"This author takes up an offense for the poor against the wealthy categorizing those with wealth - all western cizilization - as the reason many/most poor cannot escape structural poverty despite their efforts. The perspective is not completely unfair looking at the history of fallen man and his abuse of his brother, but this bias limits the credibility of the premise of the book as a Biblical Theology of possessions. Unfortunately this bias causes the author to ignore important Biblical principles in order to make his point. I was very disappointed. I did, however, find his chapter summaries to be helpful."
1,not for river use,I recently took to the river and was very disappointed. The lid fell off at every rough spot. I saw another guy that had drilled metal rings to the outside of it and put hooked straps to hold the lid on. Since I have been home i did the same. Dont know how its going to hold up. We'll see. Probably works great in a pool or a lake.
5,Great for all ages!,"I love Disney games and the like because they appeal to both boys and girls. This game is not too difficult to play. The game lets you know what buttons to push to jump, and do ""voodoo"" without stopping the game to find the instruction booklet. It's all right on the screen. I had a problem saving my game though, as there aren't many times that you can save your place. Maybe I'm wrong, since the game is fairly new and I may not of discovered everything yet. I liked the movie clips that played throughout. Gives me something to watch till the movie comes out in Dec. Overall, it's fun play."
2,So so,This was not such a great book for me. Granted it was not bad but it did not hold my attention. I found I did not care so much for the characters especially the protagonist. Also I found all the music and band jargon tedious.
5,Much too good not to reprint!!!,"I'm not going to describe the story, the other reviewers do that well. The book was totally delightful. I wanted to get copies for friends, and was astounded to find they weren't available (the books, not the friends) anywhere in the US. My own copy has been carefully put away now!"
2,I was disappointed,I have bought this book in order to find a usfull guide in sleight of hand...instead I have gotten a lot of unusfull text with ONLY 57 illustration. Think twise before bying this book.
1,Total rip-off!,"There's a 1999 American book called Who Cut the Cheese?, and this British publisher knocked it off right down to the cover. And, to make matters worse, it's hardly ""complete."""
4,"Kinda big, but if you want to keep your motorola, worth a try.","I had a motorola V710 & V810 and battery life was way too short without the extended battery. Standard battery I'd get 2-3 days, ext battery 4-5 days standby with light use. It made the phone livable, but the battery pack is rather large and includes a new cover.Actually I would recommend just getting a new phone instead! My Samsung A920 can go 10 days on the standard battery!"
1,Waste of money unless you are sure it fits.,"When I bought the battery, it listed my laptop as being compatible. When it arrived, it did not fit because of a plastic protrusion. When I managed to make it fit, the computer sent the message telling me it was an incompatible battery. Make sure the part numbers on the batteries match, or they probably will not work."
4,Amazing combat with realistic fatalities,"This game is even better than it looks. Combining the Disney-esque feel of this game with the mortal combat-like finishers, The Mark of Kri is superb. One of the best things about this game is the stealth abilites your character posseses. Don't take my word for it, get your own copy! A must have for any gamer!"
3,Gore Gore and more Gore!,"The graphics and surroundings of ""The Mark Of Kri"" are exceptional. Its more of a cartoon feel rather than that of a real gory game. Besides the graphics, the controls are unsteardy and somewhat irritating. It takes you ages to move the charachter providing your enimies ample time to harm you as much as possible. The player gets a really weird feeling after the charachter whom you play, penetrates his sword into the enemies body, gives it a 90 Degree rotation and then pulls it out. Eeire! I mean you may not feel it at the time, however you do later on. Trust me on that one!On the other hand, the sound is really good. If you love gore, a lot and a lot of gore, this game is for you. If your'e squeamish you might end up in a pretty bad situation!Overall, a good, worth for the money game. And yeah, the extra gore is included!!"
4,"4 and a half really, I love barbarian stuff :)","I dont really own this, I was sent a demo in the mail and it includes 2 beginning levels but from what I see it looks really good.....its a little brutal but hey, better to take your frustrations out on some digital characters instead of real people right >:) The animation is really smooth and the characters look cool and I like Kuzo, your pet hawk that scouts ahead and confuses your enemies for you. Definate ""conan"" feel to the game, I like it when hords of enemies dogpile you and you have to hack through em all chopping off arms heads etc.....bloody but not over the top or gratuitous....I didnt really get much of the story but I gave it 4 stars because I have only played the demo...."
2,The mark of SHORT!!!!!!,"This mark of kri game is fun but only like three levels long! This has plenty of blood, gore, and violance for me but it is just too short for me. The good thing is though I only bought it for two bucks at game stop!! So overall this game is fun but too short!"
5,Amazingly well-crafted,"Having heard that Bona Fide (2002) was the better of these two albums, I was really surprised! Clan Destiny is my favorite, by far--not that Bona Fide isn't awesome too, mind you. Clan Destiny has a really great start, then a few slow songs in the middle, and the last 5 tracks, particularly Slime Time, Capture the Moment, and Motherless Child (check out the beautiful guitar lead on this song) are simply incredible. In fact, these three songs are among my favorite WBA songs. Also, the vocals on this record are very-well done, while I felt they were a bit shaky in some spots on Bona Fide--in general, the song-writing on Clan Destiny is on a higher level than that of Bona Fide. In any case, get both CDs, they're great! Particularly Clan Destiny.Addendum: Two years later I've just listened to Clan Destiny again and, I have to say, this is in my opinion their best album in the past decade... maybe even longer."
3,"OK, but not so great.","I really don't see any reason why the transcriptions cannot be accurate. I got this one to get an idea of how to play Devil Got My Woman, and the transcription of Devil Got My Woman is not true to the recording provided. The transcription in some places has extra notes that make it impossible to use the transcription to follow what is on the CD. Other places in the song on the CD are totally missing from the transcription. You can however figure out what you need to do to play the piece from the transcription, and it is not all that difficult, but why not just be accurate in the first place?"
1,Read between the lines? No thanks.,"Really poor. Instead of using the common six line staff with numbers on the lines, they use a five line staff and put the numbers on the spaces between the lines. Totally throws you off. It's unplayable if you're used to the tab in any acoustic guitar magazine or other books. Also, the songs on the CD are NOT in the same key as the transcriptions. Thanks a lot Stefan.I regret buying this book. Sure, it's a cool photo on the cover. It's a nice enough CD. But I haven't learned one song from it yet.Anyone rating this a 5 must not have opened it or played the CD to find out the book and CD don't match. Or maybe they're just trying to get rid of their book as used."
3,"Readable but ""Energy"" of Book Seemed ""Curtailed""","Happy I read it but something was missing as contrasted with other works by the author. The book is 235 pages and that restricts development of both plot and character(s), each of which seemed hurried and abbreviated."
4,estetica,es muy estetico y le da mucha pinta al motor tapando e vacuum. lo malo es que la cinta adhesiva no pega mucho y con el calor se despega.
4,Goes well with our Victorian home!,"The only problem is that there is no way to drain water---it just accumulates in the bottom (as it does for most soap dishes). Still, I'd buy it again. Nice that it's actually brass & not just plated."
4,Good Game.,"It was a good game, best played it alternate with Elena and the guy. Story was great there lots of twist and i love how they made the Town kinda depressing, you can feel the loneliness and mystery of it. Gameplay was great, you have to capture your enemies using the sixaxis so you can absorb their ability and use it against the other enemies."
4,A nice game with nice gameplay,one of the games for PS3 which have a very nice game play.This game truly brings out the capabilities of playstation 3 system.Nice keep.
1,Too Slow,"I wish I didn't buy this game. Yes the game is colorful if you can stay awake. I don't even mind reading the subtitles, but even on my 50 inch screen we couldn't make out some of the words that were in red or green.Maybe the game got better but I couldn't make it very far before falling asleep at the controler. Paid [...] turned it in to game store for [...]!Rent first, pay later."
3,Didn't last long,"The price was right but the bottles (we got three, I think -- they're all gone now) didn't last long. The nozzle is shorter and less sturdy than the Petco bottle of the same size. The bottles were easy to clean and use and didn't drip. But they did break a few months after purchase. Next time, we'll spend a bit more and get a nicer brand."
4,Try it you may like it.,"Without using it for a time, you will never know how much it will yeild.The drum is good, and leaves no spots or streeking at this point.Just have to wait and see."
1,A Pathetic Book,"Some talk show hosts and authors must really believe that as long as they are conservative enough they will find an audience for their radio show or purchasers for their books, no matter how lacking in wit, style or substance they otherwise are. I'm afraid Mr. Savage fits into that category. In his book, he displays himself as another hack in the long line of Rush Limbaugh wannabes, but without the sense of humor.Save your money. There are al lot of of well written, funny, and thought provoking conservative books out there. This, unfortunately, is not one of them."
2,historical recordings...,"I misunderstood that this was a historical recording when I ordered it. I guess its worth the money, if you want 1930s monorecordings, but I was dissappointed :("
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"THIS WILL BE MY THIRD REVEIW OF THIS SO CALLED BOOK,MAYBE THE CENSORS AT AMAZON WILL POST IT. ANYWAY I HAVE READ MANY A TRUE CRIME BOOK,AND BY FAR THIS WAS THE WORST. I CANT BELIEVE IT WAS AS BAD AS IT WAS. THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK IS BY FAR THE WORST STORYTELLER IVE WITNESSED. BORING AND GORY TO THE EXTREME,AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW. THE SENTENCE OF THE MURDERER IN THE BOOK SHOULD GET,IS TO BE FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY PUNISH YOURSELVE PUT THIS GARBAGE IN YOUR SHOPPING CART."
3,The Killer is probably happy a book was written about him...,"but he doesn't deserve the ink. The book was not bad however, there is more to Jason Massey's dirty home and lazy mother, then I think was addressed. Yes, the author did mention sexual abuse.. but I think there was alot more to creating this monster...there are alot of people who were abused but don't kill people or have sex with dead animals. There are people that grew up in horrible conditions that never decapitated a young girl. The book could have been a better character study but all in all it wasn't bad."
2,"I guess it could""t be any better !","This is a disapointing dvd. Chuck should have saved it for family movies. It is great however to see him working after so much tradgaty through his drug days though, so I give him all the credit for that.Its a low budget piece of work ! So it is probably good at best considering that. He's a lucky guy to have such a nice looking family after it all.There is forgivness in life, so I forgive him for this dvd. Try again....."
5,three dog night lives,if you are a fan of three dog night this dvd is a must. it is great. you feel like you are going through the day with chuck before the concert. you get to see his family. he sings with one of his daughters who is very talented. during chucks songs you get to see him from the 70s and now doing the same song. also the original drummer of three dog night has a part in the show. thank you chuck for making this dvd. maybe cory and danny will see this and get back together with chuck.
2,DRUGS,DRUGS HAVE TAKEN THERE TOLL ON CHUCK. HIS VOICE IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS WHEN HE SANG WITH 3 DOG NIGHT
5,Vampire hottie alert!,"I am totally in love with this series! i had read some of the books years ago, but was not aware of the series until after it had been taken off the air. Too bad, this was very well written, and our vampire hero is so choice!"
4,Great Gift For A Girl,I bought this at a clearence store for my teenage daughter who had been wanting a guitar for a while. I gave it to her for christmas and she was ecstatic! It is a great value and comes with many features from the gig bag to the amp. Great deal!
1,Boring,Perhaps being Canadian I see enough snow without reading about it. Could not get at all interested in story although I forced myself to try.
2,Unbelieveable-Literally,"Sorry, I wanted to like this book because I have liked all her others, but this was a challenge to get through for me and I was glad when I finished it. I knew who did it before I had even read a third of the book. I found Kate to be a very mean spirited one-woman superwoman. Kate had to do everything in this book by herself, did not want the help from the capable agencies in place who would normally take care of these matters, and was, indeed, insulting to any one of them who tried to help her. She broke the law by selling murder evidence she found, had no qualms of conscience about doing that, even felt she deserved the money from it. Her treatment of the Korean mountain climbers left me disgusted. What a thoroughly dislikeable character."
2,"Sounds like the actual tracks, but...","... when I went to my favorite karaoke haunt, the lyrics to the song didn't show up on the screen. Now, what good is a karaoke CD that doesn't work? I ended up winging it on the song I sang, which went okay considering. BUT, next time, I'm going to use a different CD. And if this hadn't been given to me as a gift, I'd return it."
3,Hard to shut it,"My Daughter and I have a hard time getting this thing to shut, it keeps wanting to pop back open."
5,Great Toy,My granddaughter is 3 and she can actually do the Pollys with the magnetic clothes. This was a great value.
4,Tippy toy,"while I love this concept, there is one problem. You push a button and the case opens itself, but if you don't make sure to hold onto it, the entire thing tips over almost immediately (as we found out the first time we tried it). Otherwise a really cute storage system."
3,Needs some slack...,"This game was GREAT the first few times I played it. However, as it progressed, the levels got so ridiculously difficult that I stopped trying to beat them and kept playing the older levels...which got boring really fast. Haven't touched it since, I'm tired of trying to beat it and not getting anywhere."
3,Too repetative,"OK, the game looks nice, and Mario can do some nifty moves. But then what? What's up with playing the same world/level over and over again?? Sheesh. I got bored after a couple of hours, although each world is well-made. I think the special fantasy block-style courses are the most challenging, which saves the game from becoming a total disaster. The gameplay is more platform-like and also faster and more difficult than during the normal levels. Beware if you have a short fuse though! Its good that they make the gamepads so durable. ;)So if you like games where you solve little puzzles and collect items for small rewards, this game might be for you. If you are looking for a more classic super-mario platform-like game, I wouldn't shell out the money needed to buy this game. Instead I'd take a closer look at Zelda - the wind waker. If you disregard the cartoonish look, you'll soon find out that they've made almost everiything else about it right. Astonishing gameplay!"
3,I think its good,"Well, I did not play the whole game. But I think it's good. I am in the middle of the game but I think Luigi's Manson is better. In Luigi's Manson, you suck up ghosts, but in this, you use water blaster. Try it and maybe you will like it, but try Luigi's Manson first. Super Mario Sunshine is a fun game to play, But Luigi's Manson is more fun."
5,Sweet game!!,"This game is a really cool game. I think it is one of the best platforms! It has good graphics tons of mini games, and 56 levels. It's only problem is that it is only a single player game and that there are alot of places that you can't go. Other than that it's good. It has lots of running, jumping, dodging, shooting (with Fludd which is kinda a water gun) and fighting- evrything you need in a platform game. If you like platform games you want this one."
4,A MASTERPIECE!!!,"I've been a Mario fan since 1989 and i've played many great Mario games. I do have to say, this game is one of the best Mario games i have played as of now. The graphics and great, the gameplay is great as usual, and the music was very kool. I had previously said this game was hard, but as i replayed it over and over, i realized that it was simple. I give Nintendo alot of credit for developing this game. This is a must-have for any owner of a GCN. Whoever doesn't own this game doesn't deserve to be called a gamer."
2,Bah!,"I can't put my finger on it--but there's something about ""Sunshine"" that just doesn't rub right with me. Maybe it's the horrible voice acting. Maybe it's the blindingly bright, cherry graphics that make me want to hurl. Or maybe it's because Mario moves like a rabid elephant with shards of broken glass stuck in its feet. The ""vacation"" theme of the game gets old (I WANT A SNOW LEVEL, DARN IT); Peach has become the biggest ditz; and Yoshi dissolves as soon as he hits water. Oh, and FLUDD is the biggest pain in the butt to use. It's still a respectable action game; but it doesn't live up to previous Mario titles. I played this game for a while, and after I beat it, I havn't touched it since. A disapointment for Mario fans."
3,not what you would expect,"Super Mario Sunshine is a dissapointment. Don't let great reviews persuade you to buy this game. I warn you that I bought this game, and it was not even as good as Mario 64. It gets very boring running around spraying enourmous amounts of mud and little plants that are not impressive at all. Sure, the graphics are nice, especially the water, but surely you wouldn't just buy a game for its graphics? Sadly, I beat the game (not getting all of the stars) and the ending wasn't even as good as Mario 64. A step down from the last mario game, don't buy this unless you are young and just getting into adventure games. Too much was expected of this, but it shouldn't even get a second look."
4,The greatest of the Mario series yet!,"I absolutely love this game! The fact that you have the option of rocketing around with a water pack completely stuns me. The graphics aren't top notch, but WHO CARES?! The story line is great, but for some of the puzzles, you require a strategy guide. Mario's main goal in the game is to clean up the terribly large graffiti mess left by Shadow Mario. Play through the game as Mario meets new friends, solves puzzles, and returns the Shine Sprites to their rightful place at the Shine Gate!"
3,The product itself was in great condition...,"The gameplay however is, in my opinion, sub-par at best. I used to own Mario Sunshine and had fond memories of it. It had gotten damaged, and it wasn't until now that I decided to replace it.After playing Mario Galaxy 1 & 2, I was in the mood for some ""Retro"" Gamecube gaming. Yikes.Mario controls like a wet sack of grain that rolls around on dry land, and a hippo with no front legs in the water. That's putting it nicely.Another thing I didn't remember is how all coins that appear when you destroy an enemy disappear 2 seconds after being dropped on the ground. I don't know what drastically changed from this to Galaxy, but I'm glad it did and hope Nintendo never looks back.I know not all games age well. Even Mario 64 has quite a few problems as I go back and replay it. I'll just say, ""Be careful before you buy"".If you're repurchasing, you might not get the same experience you remembered from years past.If you've never played before, rent it first. Trust me."
5,Amazing Game,"This game is awesome. In my opinion, it is the greatest video game in history. It is nice and challenging, and the levels are very fun. The addition of F.L.U.D.D makes it even more unique and fun. I highly reccomend this game to anyone."
1,Fun?,"3 words. Worse game ever. This game is a complete waste of your money. All of you wondering how you can go wrong with Mario, just play this game and you will find out. Not only does it suck it's very easy. The camera is the worst and Fludd is the most annoying thing that I have encountered in my life. The graphics are good but not great and the controls are easy to learn but aside from that It's a complete waste of your money."
2,This is too much like the last one!,"I played the new Mario Sunshine and it plays exactly the same as Super Mario 64. It has the exact same layout (one main world with little sub-worlds each with six versions of almost the same objective) and it borrowed some voice clips from the last game. Plus, the camera is messed up. It got stuck in cornerS moved to slowly. Another thing, whoever did the voices for this game did terrible job. They'd be better off getting the people who does the Sonic Adventure voices. The graphic kinda bland with the exception of the water effects. Overall, I think they just rushed this out because 2002 holiday season is almost here and they didnt have Mario game for when Gamecube first came out. Given another year and it might have been much better."
4,pretty good,"it is a great game but it doesnt match mario 64. its a good game but its not that easy not that hard. its a pretty fun game though like dont think it sucks it is a good game like you know id buy it, but only because its like $30. if it was 50 darra i dont think so. but its a good game. i dont think its bad cause its like the other mario's. save the princess save the princess save her mario save her crap."
4,"Super Mario Sunshine, get fun and a nice tan!","This game is just fun, fun, fun! Me and my four year son have both plenty of fun playing this game (even its just an one-player game).Bright and vivid colours, friendly-looking figures, nice music and entertaining action makes this game suitable for children.Here are some challenging tasks and some cunning plots, but above it all: FUN!"
3,last in line mario game but ok,the first thought was a bit to harsh. super mario sunshine the game was great and all but it had les levels. bowser is the boss again and com on cant h be a bit harder to defeat. mario 64 was long hard and hd so many stuff like flyin boxes and stuff. wat i liked about part one was you could rie yoshi. mario 64 hit sunshine out the park bya mile. when sunshne came out i was soexcited but got dissapointed. guesi shouldnt have begged my parnts to buy it. overall its a so so game.
2,A Lean book,"This book was not an easy read and I would not recomend it for a first time lean reader. However, if you have a good understanding of lean concepts and understand production flow then this book is a great way to learn from the mind of a true inovator. Shingo is one of the fathers of lean manufacturing and this book does a good job of covering his lean principles"
4,Excellant book to understand how the TPS evolved.,I enjoyed it since it gave me insight on how TPS evolved and allowed me to better understand not how TPS works but more why.
3,"good game,good music",This was not the best game but it was good.The pixel hunting was a little annoying at times because it made it tricky finding objects.I liked how the rooms were damaged after the collision with the squid.I liked how you could find new items after the collision.Some of the rooms i was never in after the collision.I wish i could have gotten in those rooms.I noticed a statue of a white goose in nemo's room on the desk.Even though the goose and several other objects were useless they do add to the graphics of the game.
3,Not Abnett's best,"As other reviewers have said, Straight Silver seems more like a continuation and a set-up, than a full and worthy instalment in the Gaunt's Ghosts series.Which isn't to say that it's a bad book - not the case at all. The Ghosts are sent to a world of trench warfare, to reinforce the burned-out Imperial forces there; but Chaos has also sent reinforcements, and they're preparing for a breakthrough... which is pretty much the sum of the plot.There IS some good setup, and Abnett again proves that he can write first-rate combat... but we KNEW he could, and the context of this combat isn't much better. Several of the character subplots continue, there's character development... et cetera.If you're a reader of the series, you'll want this sixth book - if only because it DOES set a few things up for the vastly superior seventh. If you're not, this is probably the worst place you could possibly start. Worth the purchase price, but Abnett could have done much better."
2,unfortunately this book doesn't hold up,"I have really enjoyed the Gaunt's Ghosts series so far, and I have thought that Abnett's use of characters and setting has been imaginitive and enjoyable. In Straight Silver however, the plot never seems to draw the reader in, and the end of the book left me very unsatisfied. Also, the trench war setting seems on an exact par with WWI, and as a result, there are numerous inconsistencies with a 41st millenium battlefield. I guess that I only voice my disappointment, because I felt his other books were so good. I would highly reccommend the previous books, but this one is not as good."
3,"Nice Watch, Poor Product Description","Nice looking watch but Amazon has poor product description. Please be advised that the band is MATTE stainless steal and NOT POLISHED. I bought this for my fiance thinking that it had a nice polish finish on the band like her other Omega watches. Nope. I returned this watch to order the 1465.71 that HAS the polish band. Only reason I knew that was because I went to my local jeweler! Matte (brushed) finish is very abrasive to the skin and does not feel good. It also makes the diamonds on the bezel look cheap. I suggest that anyone looking to buy an expensive watch to check it out at your local jeweler first. But of course, I had another problem with that watch too (it came with no authenticity cards). Anyways, in general, Amazon needs to do a better job, specifically their JEWELRY department."
2,Mid-1980s Re-Recordings - Not the Originals At All,"These tracks date from the mid-1980s, originally issued on Petula's ""Give It A Try"" album, which was the first time she re-recorded several of her classic 1960s hits like ""Downtown"" and ""Don't Sleep In The Subway."" (She would later re-record the hits again in the late 1980s to better effect and again, to lesser effect, in the mid 1990s). If you want the TRUE original hits, then buy ""Ultimate Petula Clark"" on BMG or ""The Ultimate Collection"" on Sanctuary or ""Petula Clark Anthology"" on Hip-O/Universal. They are all top quality winners. This one is for collectors only."
2,Supervising Police Personnel,"This book is entirly overwritten. It is very listy, for example, It tells you that there is 6 characteristics of a well written report. Then in the very next line he tells of the 6 different types of reports. Then he goes further to break down each type of report and explain what they are and why they are used. The ideas are notable. However the book's content is poorly written and is more for the overall manager not specific to police services. And yes, one needs to do the job before one can write about it."
1,Horrible!!,This book is just plain bad. Writer has very hard time getting anything across clearly..way to wordy for the simple messages that he is trying to get across. Avoid if at all possible unless you like to sleep!! or if you have to read it for a test...even then not worth it!!
2,I think I'm going to be sick...,"This game unfortunately lacks the polish of a top-tier 3-D platform title. The 3D is often disorientating, often causing me to get nauseous. Gameplay consists of collecting hidden DNA and lots of instant death situations when trying to locate the DNA and hidden film clips. Not recommended."
3,"Bill's the best, but Tony...","I'm sorry, friends. I had high hopes for this one and I feel a bit deflated. There's nothing like the way Bill Evans plays; just listen to ""TheTouch of Your Lips"". Magic... Tony Bennett, on the other hand, sounds like he musta been hungover."
4,Came great,"Came Great, i can not complain, if you need it, buy it, its a good deal, what else can i say?"
3,North Face Powerstretch Mens Casual Gloves 2012,These gloves are ok for driving I guess but not for temperatures below freezing. I wore them the other day and I also put some other gloves over them just to keep my hands somewhat warm.
5,WHAT A GUY!,"I JUST HAD COME HERE ON AMAZON.COM AND LET ALL YOU GOOD FOLKS KNOW JUST WHAT TYPE OF GUY I THINK THIS PIZZAMAN IS. I MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ATLANTA AT THE SUPERBOWL.WELL ACTUALLY HE WAS AT MACY'S THE THURSDAY BEFORE THE BIG GAME DOING A COOKING DEMONSTRATION.WHAT I NOTICED RIGHT AWAY WAS HOW HE CAN CHARM A CROWD. I MEAN I AM A VERY FICKLE LADY WHEN IT COMES TO CON ARTISTS AND SUCH. BUT THIS GUY EXUDED WARMTH AND SINCERITY AS HE SO GRACIOUSLY FED EVERYONE.I RUSHED RIGHT HOME AND ORDERED THIS BOOK, ONLY BECAUSE I TASTED WHAT HE WAS COOKING AND IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS GUY HAS A REAL TALENT FOLKS AND I REALLY HOPE HE BECOMES EVERYTHING HE DREAMS OF.ONE OTHER THING I MUST SAY FOLKS AND DON'T GET ME WRONG BECAUSE I'M 76 YEARS OLD BUT NOT ONLY IS HE DROP DEAD GORGEOUS BUT HE CAN COOK TOO! WAY TO GO PIZZAMAN, THANKS AGAIN. BON APETITTO!"
4,BRS Pathology Flashcards,"I think the cards are a unique approach to studying the subject. Many ""Flashcards"" out there are not really flash cards at all, rather textbooks on small pieces of paper. These cards help me quickly refresh material before an exam in an active manner rather than reading the material over and over again. Though I think the cards are a rather poor way to learn the material, they are a great way to review."
1,very disappointing,these cards only have the name of the condition and a few WORDS (some as few as 5) about the pathology.
5,Great collection of classic Black Sabbath,This book contains a good selection of the old original Sabbath - great guitar songs from the early days! Tony Iomi at his very finest!!
4,Great Introductory Book,"With a franchise as diversified like the X-Men, I don't think anyone can't create a guide to satisfy all fans, new or old. Personally I find this a very comprehensive introductory guide to the world of the X-Men. I particularly like the way they structured the guide - 60s, 70s, 80s, etc. with some information on the important sagas. If you're an old-time fan, you may find the book a bit too simple, but overall a credible effort which deserves a 4-star rating."
2,Great Game. Bad Port.,"This port (for the GBA) of the ever loved classic Earthworm Jim is riddled with game stopping bugs. If you want this game pick up the original, or the HD remaster on XBLA or PSN (now SEN)."
2,"I like El better as a geezer, thanks.","Like others have already said, Ed Greenwood is a good game designer but a lousy writer. That's not to say he's not descriptive. He manages to present a situation without taking ten pages to describe it(I call this Jordanism), but Greenwood makes the likeable Elminster into an arrogant snot in this book. Elminster goes rapidly from a wuss to a cosmic badass who kicks the hell out of ancient red dragons and ""archmages"" faster than you can roll 12d6. Greenwood makes Elminster obscenely powerful at, what, age 40? What's he now, 750? Why isn't he playing basketball with crystal spheres? Doesn't make sense. I liked Elminster better when I didn't know where he came from. Avoid this book and stick to dedicated authors like Salvatore."
4,I loved it...,"I loved this book. It was a very fun read. If you are into short books that go quickly, then this is the book for you. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is that the author dragged the initial part of the story out and rushed the ending like it was an after-thought. Overall it was a good book."
2,Finally!,"A book that exceeds the horrors of Spellfire and Crown of Fire by the same author! Almost a good book! Full of nude scenes! Filled with impossible magic! Behold, Elminster defeats some twenty soldiers after going, ""Give me a little cider before I deal with them, thank you.""EEEeeeeek!"
3,"4 - star content, 1 - star production quality.","This DVD set is a must-have for any Shotokan Karate practitioner. From basic punches and kicking techniques to advanced kata and kumite, these DVDs cover almost everything there is to know about traditional karate-do.Having said that, the production quality and content are not perfect:1) Sound quality is poor.2) Menu system (scene selection) is poorly done.3) Sensei Kanazawa goes into great detail while explaining karate techniques, but he does so in English with a thick Japanese accent which is often very hard to understand. Subtitles would be an invaluable asset, but they are not available on these DVDs.4) Not all Shotokan Kata are included. I recommend getting Kanazawa's tape ""All 26 Shotokan Karate Kata"" in addition to this set.Overall, 4 stars for content, 1 star for production quality."
4,"Even on the smooth tip, Sweet Tee is still totally sweet!","Sweet Tee was one of the illest, most sick rappers of all time(with exceptions from Salt-N-Pepa, JJ FAD, Queen Latifah, and Monie Love.) Sometimes I wander wht happened to the ol' skool female rappers. I haven't heard from YO-YO, JJ FAD, Monie Love, and Sweet Tee for a LONG time. My all-time favorite Sweet Tee song is the banger ""On The Smooth Tip."" I hope some of these ol' skool female rappers come back some day."
3,Beginners Mat,"It's a servicable mat, gets me by day to day. but I would recoment using it only on carpet, because it is really too thin to use comfortably on a hard tile or wood floor."
4,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book and learned a LOT from it.. I would recommend it to anyone that has never used DW and wants to.
1,Not good,"Really don,t like it at all, played it several times and bought it buy mistake as I wanted the 70,s German band Ramses! My fault."
3,Very Basic,This book is too basic for an intermediate or advanced bodybuilder. It is a good read for a newbie however.
2,This book needs more,"This is an okay book for those who are beginners in the Java language. I wouldn't recommend this book because there not much meat in the text. Even if you have never programmed before, this book just doesn't give much to work with. The book mostly focuses on simple code and java background, not really useful for more than just getting your feet wet. I would suggest another book that has more complex and useful java code."
4,Exclent book for jump-start,"You will not become java wizard, but you will have a foothold required for more advanced and detailed tutorials such as Sun's. I took away one star because of somewhat outdated version of Java it covers. Still, with complementary www site, great little package."
4,Entertaining,"The first season of ""Murder One"" is a good show. The only thing I didn't like was the long intro for every episode; They showed what happened on the last episode and did the music intro every time. The music was kinda overwhelming and made serious moments seem funny. But, what are you gonna do?....It was the 90's :)"
3,Gets the most from the topic,"Were the author to have simply told the story of what occurred, we'd have only a short essay. By weaving in the respective stories of those involved he succeeds in making the most of what otherwise would be a quite short recounting of an awful event. But, given the willfulness of those involved to achieve the summit of the Half Dome despite a looming storm it's difficult to really dig into the story and it's this that holds the book back. It's well written, and does a good job maintaining some distance from the principal players, but I just couldn't get past the idiocy of marching up a bare rock face into a storm. Additionally, the book sets up Rice as the main instigator and yet his perspective is notably absent. Inclusion of that would have made things more interesting. In all, a decent and quick read. Didn't tell me anything about lightning safety, though, that shouldn't already be common knowledge."
3,Shattered Air,"As a big fan of Half Dome, I was really looking forward to reading ""Shattered Air."" Unfortunately, this book was not quite what I was expecting. Content-wise, the primary story of tragedy made for a serious but very interesting read. However, the rest of the book was often not as interesting. The book addressed too many tangential elements - history of the Yosemite Decimal System, historical context of the mid-1980s - which didn't do much to add to the story."
2,I can tell!,"I'm sorry to say that this is one of Kathleen Eagle's less interesting books. I've read them all and enjoyed them, especially as the world she writes about, Native Americans today, is considered honestly and seriously, so the reader is enlightened. This latest one, however, seems to be more concerned with filling us in on the siutation with all Native Americans rather than with the story of Heather and Kole. Heather, a world-class journalist, sets out to get his story. She meets this elusive character so easily, in the first chapter, it's laughable. There is no real tension or relationship between the characters, no real depth. They just seem to be mouthpieces for the Native American Indian Movement. I was sorely disappointed."
2,"Too repetitive, no new challenges","The single player mode gets boring after awhile. The enemy characters and sayings are extremely repetitve and there is no real ""extras"" in the game. The graphics are not really that ""gory"" and they are also very repetitive. I found quake 2 to have better blood loss and change in death scenes. The major problem I found was with the compatibility of XP. I have a new computer and almost everytime I was somewhere in the game it would kick out of the system and I would lose everyting, It was very frustrating to restart the game and hope it would even load. The only thing I did enjoy about the game was the multiple weapon systems and alternative fire methods. I find the game disappointing at best."
1,A Shadow of What He Was,This effort is nowehere near as good as Red's last outing.Not that he could be outed much more than he already has been.Save your money!
2,If Only We Could Delete Songs from Existence......,"The Macarena belongs six feet underground. I received this album as a Christmas present back in the heyday of this dance club hit. It's a perfectly fine CD if you enjoy the Macarena, and with 4 different versions of the song on this single, it's over 20 minutes of hip shaking fun. It of course adds the Christmas element by putting some jingle bells and a few 'Ho ho ho's' here and there, from Santa himself. Perfect gift to keep in a time capsule to remember the 90's."
4,A pleasant surprise...,"I found this movie to be very entertaining. It's got hot chicks, good action. I thought it would be ""B movie"" quality but found it to have a very high production quality. It's a little corny but not nearly as bad as some movies like 'Tekken' and other badly made video game movies.Very enjoyable movie. RottenTomatoes.com only gave it a 34% rotten rating which I think is low and my movie tastes usually match with the critics on there. However, they did sum it up pretty good, ""With a ridiculous plot and comical acting, checking one's brain at the door is required before watching DOA: Dead or Alive."""
1,For kids???,"I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original.I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on."
4,I love this game!,"I saw this game on the sale shelf at the store and decided to give it a try. I fell in love with it after the first time I played it!There are only 10 cases to solve, which is a bummer, but the 10 cases each have their own story which adds to the fun. While the original games simply used the process of elimination to win the game, this one has other clues that go beyond just putting X's on a pad.Like I said, there are only 10 cases and the fact that it didn't seem to sell very well, I'm doubting there will new DVDs released anytime soon. Also, I don't think this is a kid's game. The clues are a bit abstract and when you hear a clue, you really have no idea how it fits in until later (so write everything down!).I realize some people balk at the price for this game, and I can't really say if it's worth it or not since I did get it on sale. But after playing this game, I fell like I got the deal of a lifetime!"
1,Save your clams,"This is the first Peachpit Press Visual Quickstart book that didn't live up to its billing. All the others in the series are great, but this one has numerous errors, hardly any of the examples work, and nothing is explained very well at all. Also some of the more interesting affects in DHTML aren't even covered. A big fat thumbs down."
4,Overall....an informative and entertaining journey,"let's make this short and sweet:Good book, lots of facts and great pictures. Many of the facts are wrong.....just read the section on the members of Whitesnake....the author lists Ian Paice as the sole drummer for Whitesnake.....what aboutCozy Powell, Aynsley Dunbar and Tommy Aldridge. It seems the author was a bit lazy on some of the research. If you pick up this book,you too may find some discrepencies....but overall it's a good book!"
3,"Good research and pacing, poor ending and main character","The author of the series is a script writer under his real name.The series is well researched. My time in Korea was in the Marine Corps and further south, but he captured the setting that I knew, and did it well.The pacing is also great, as is the writing of the non-protagonist characters.The issue was with the protagonist, he was very cardboard.In addition, I pulled off another star because the ending was rushed. In fact, I would call it a reverse James Brady ending (Brady being the other good Korea small unit combat author, only in the Korean war period.)"
3,Not necessary,"This is a good book, and has good advice in it, but honestly you are better off in just asking a senior resident what you should do, and watching residents you admire and following their example. You don't need to buy this unless you just can't talk to anybody."
3,Patti gave it us something to listen too...,"At first listen i thought it's just ok nothing really stood out in fact ""did you pray today"" the first song on the recording i knew i had heard before and i looked in my collection and found the lisa taylor version and when i played it I thought maybe patti should listen to how it should be done and it's rare that i think patti labelle needs to be compared to anyone but this time I am sorry to say patti you have done better and i look forward to your nex ""great recording""."
2,Patti's Generosity is Better Than The Material,"Patti Labelle's unusual and soaring voice certainly wasn't used to its fullest advantage on this much anticipated CD. She is constrained and set way, WAY down in the mix and doesn't sing the gospel as much as she does the inspirational thing with a couple of gospel singing celebrities. Perhaps a live turn with this singer and some more traditional material we could have been gifted with something that could compete with Aretha's and Gladys's gospel CD's. ""Walk Around Heaven"" is an old time gospel standard that needed to be beefed up. She softens it with a soft second soprano infused background that ruins the effect of the lyric. The duet with CeCe Winans (Walk Away) is interesting with its dialouge interplay between the two women. The best thing about this project is that the essence of the gospel message is seen (if not heard) in Patti's donation to cancer research. God Bless Patti Labelle for her grand gift. Musicaly, this is a major disappointment."
1,What a mess!!!,"Patti Labelle who in her heyday could be an electrifying live performer for some strange reason almost always had a problem to bring the same level of excitement to her recordings. But nothing could have prepared me for this confused mess of a record here. Her return to Gospel after decades as an outrageous pop-diva is, if anything, halfhearted. This is neither a spiritual nor a particularly spirited album, it's third rate gospel-pop. Not only is much of the material totally uninspired, but one also has the feeling that it is only for marketing reasons or because she lost her mainstream recording deal that she is going the Gospel and the charity route here. By far the worst album I bought this year!"
3,Good music that one forgot about...,Was great to here some of these older tracks again... Rosie Vela's jazzy sound is the high-light of this CD. Great to here Magic Smile again... (She should re-release her Zazu album on CD!)
1,Illogical trash,"This is undoubtedly the worst book I have read on this subject. It is pedantic, boring, and relies more on hearsay and opinion than confirmable fact. The bottom-line theory that ""empire"" is the foundation of the Anglo-American relationship is out-and-out false; there has been no ""Anglo"" empire in nearly a century. Don't waste your time on this trash."
4,"Good resource, much is common knowledge approaches","I thought this was a nice resource. It has some good song and activity ideas. A lot of the interactions are things people naturally do with infants without being told to incorporate that in their actions. (At least for a parent) The organization of the book is a little difficult and not as easy to use as the Toddler book. I am still glad I purchased it for my son, though."
1,"Boring, not what I hoped for","Content was repetitive, boring. Did not give me the good, new, interesting ideas I was hoping to use in those moments when I run out of things to do to keep him stimulated and learning."
1,Scam,"This product is pathetic. I followed all of the instructions and added it to the furnace filter. Turned the furnace fan on and at first it was awesome. The entire house smelt like cinnamon. It lasted 2 days!!! Everyone that has come over to my house, I have asked if they could smell the air freshener and they said not at all. This product is a border line scam. I could have sprayed the entire house with Lysol and had a better result. Total waste of Money"
1,Don't bother,"Although this film tries to be a documentary with some fresh looks at NASA and space exploration, it is a poor example of the filmmakers' art. Historical events are jumbled in a distracting way, photos and clips are used and reused to excess, voice-over is mis-matched to soundtrack music, and the films reflections on NASA's failures is summarily judgmental. The previously unreleased footage is not that interesting and overall you can skip this one and not miss anything. Next?"
4,great CD,"this is a great CD. Rahsaan is his usual melodic self on the reeds and boy, do I love Brother Jack McDuff playing that Hammond B-3 organ! Every track is great, the music swings."
2,Geared for Residents of Manhattan Island (and Wanna-bes),"This guide is deceptively convenient and easy-to-read.It's major problem is with the people surveyed for the movie reviews. With overuse of words like ""kitschy"", ""Mensch"", and ""elegiac"", as well as a disproportionate number of the 2,500 or so reviews involving arthouse documentaries and Woody Allen movies, this guide is best-suited for people who believe the Pacific Ocean is two blocks west of Madison Square Garden.Leonard Maltin's Guide has eight times the number of movies covered --- for 40% less money."
4,exactly what I was looking for,This product was just what I was looking for. It makes me able to split wood without splitting my feet or legs. It is not electric so it won't go any faster than I choose to have it go.
1,Non-returnable because it's old stock - RIP OFF!!,"I am a Creed collector, and when I was almost out of a 1 oz travel size of Erolfa that I bought at full price in a reputable department store, I found this great deal online, so of course I sprang for it. Bad idea. I received a bottle in old, old packaging, and the scent has obviously aged in a not-good way. The bottle I received does not match the photo on this site. I am very angry at Amazon for selling inferior merchandise in this price range. They must have known it's bad merchandise due to the non-returnable policy. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!"
4,"good, if not excellent, date","I always consider this album is overrated. Henderson blows OK with familiar licks. But he does not extend enough, both in time and in creativity. Most songs are less than 4-5 minutes.I would rather recommend Tetragon for Milestones date or any blue note dates."
2,Problem watch,"I bought this watch in Feb. 2004. In May 2004 it no longer kept time. It gained about 1 hour each day. It had to sent out for repair which took 3 weeks. The watch is also difficult to read under certain lighting conditions-the ""anti-reflective crystal"" is hardly that. It's a nice looking watch, but there are better choices."
2,NO sound amplification for this so-called microphone,Based on the other reviews I decided to try this one out in the store before I bought and I'm glad I did. I could not even hear myself through the mic when I tested it. There is no sound amplification. I would call this more of a dictaphone or recording device than a microphone.
1,Terrible for Singing Purposes,Can barely hear yourself (you child) trying to sing. No idea how this got ANY ratings above 3. The buttons are also really clumsy; your 3 year old will be frustrated.
2,doesn't amplify,"Press the star button and it doesn't amplify, at most so weakly it might as well be off. It sort of records - only for a few seconds and playback is at a low volume. Songs don't have vocals to sing along with. A disappointing purchase."
3,"eh, it's a play microphone, nothing special.",we thought this would be more fun than it is. grandson has shown almost NO interest in it. kinda disappointed.
5,Fast delivery on Canon copier,I was thrilled to receive this copier the very next day after I ordered it. I needed it for business reasons and was expecting to wait a few days for it to be delivered. The quality of this copier is excellent. Thank you for such good service.
4,The Standard Source,"If you have any interest in the Philokalia at all, you should start with this book. It is not the entire text, by a long shot - the complete text of the Philokalia in English is still being produced, although I believe that most of it has been published. This book deals with those portions of the Philokalia that discuss the Jesus Prayer.If your interest is in the Prayer, this book belongs on your book shelf. As it is also a representative sample, this book will also help you decide if you want to tackle the entire Philokalia. The book was first published quite a few years ago, and it has been quoted in so many sources that if you're interested in the subject at all you will probably find that you have already read sizable portions of it."
3,Completionist Alert !!!,"This version has Cubik:98 not on the '05 version,but lacks Cobra Bora & 10 x 10.I'd download Cubik + get the '05."
2,"Great product, but concerned about the price","A nickel for $4.55 seems a bit excessive, don't you think? Pretty sure I can get this for something like 9100% less elsewhere.But I want to emphasize that this is a great product. I own several nickels myself, and find that they constantly come in handy."
1,not very durable,"This unit is not made very well, in fact it is flimsy to say the least. In any case the rollers were not compressing equally and as a result my sheet of pasta was coming out thick and thin, sort of like wavy. I had to return it for a refund and I am looking for a more authentic and durable well made version."
4,Pasta Maker,The shipment was ontime and CucinaPro works great. As others have stated the handle does fall out easily but that is not much of an issue because I purchased the motor to go with and it saves so much time and work as well.
4,Deep thought and simple perspective,"This work takes giant steps with the history of science and cosmology. From the Big Bang to Life, from Copernicus to Lovelock, Professor Gribbin advances the theory of complex order from simple rules.A reader familiar with complexity theory may feel they have heard all this before. Professor Gribbin however takes a very mathematical approach to the subject and delivers am interesting and readable account of his subject.I recommend this work to serious lay readers (casual science readers may find the math daunting, although just appreciating the author's enthusiasm will be infectious) and to a general academic audience. The scope is vast but engagingly presented and readable.Throughout the work Professor Gribbin goes on tangents and then announces that it is out of the scope of the present work. I challenge the good professor to write a new work on just those tangents. I for one will be happy to read it."
2,A Fairly Weak Collection,"Decent submissions from Tom Drury, Jeffrey Eugenides, Melanie Rae Thon and Jonathan Franzen, but overall the choices don't really smack of greatness. Plus, many of the entries feel too much like bits of novels yanked out of the overall context of the novel itself, so that in a vacuum, they pretty much whither away. There's also some fairly glaring omissions here (no David Foster Wallace or Richard Powers? What planet are these people from???), but I guess beauty's in the eye. Or whatever"
2,Crabsody in blue is NOT on this disk.,I payed the extra money based on reviewers saying crabsody is on this version but it's not.
4,"while it doesn't merit 5 stars, a great book all the same","While this is a wonderful completion of the trilogy it doesn't quite merit 5 stars. This book seemed to drag out the subject a little bit longer then necessary. All in all though, the Kissed By An Angel trilogy is a wonderful set of books, a joy to read, and very inspiring."
3,some secrets were supposed to be private,"If there was anything true, everybody would know it already. People who have to put up or shut up because they have gotten in the way of institutions trying to control the future of space and time get bounced around in a society that depends on reputations that can be mixed with pornography or obscene material as most evidence never gets to the history books because of the flushing nature of indoor plumbing. Deep politics has crossed state lines."
3,book lacks spaghetti incident,I noticed that this book unfortunately lacked all accounts of the famed spaghetti throwing incident at Northwestern University's Foster Walker Complex. I think this was an especially important chapter in the history of Delta Sigma Theta and their lack of respect for sleeping residents of the university dormitory.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is gross. The calories are very high and the product does not taste good. If anyone has had odawalla bars, this cookie has that taste. This could be worse than those bars. For something with 300 calories, I would expect it to have a decent taste. Don't waste your money on this product.If you look at the ingredients, they are the same for almost all flavors of this cookie. So basically, all the other flavors will have a similar flavor.If this product is improved, maybe more people will buy it.Expect to use the bathroom more when using this product. This is a plus and a negative."
5,Teen Titans: A Kid's Game,"I was reluctant to get Teen Titans books because I thought I couls live without them. That the Infinite Crisis chronology doesn't deserve for me to buy a whole collection of teenage books. I don't know yet about the chronology, but I can honestly say I was wrong in not getting it.GEoof Jones once again gave me proof he can't do no wrong. This is a very exiting book. I can't believe I'm reading it just now. I actually bought the whole Teen titans books because I have a big discount in them, and man!, I'm happy to get them.What it means to be a teenage. What's the value of privacy and true friendship?.Jones story plus McKone drawings makes this a very action pack great story. Watching the New Generation of heroes fighting their way with the League was mindblowing... Oh yeah, and Nightwing is cool as he can be.I loved this book. I can't recommend it enough."
5,WHERE'S THE DVD?!!!?,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I THINK IT IS GOOD FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE FOR YEARS. AND IT STILL FEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME, EVERY TIME I WATCH IT. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT IN DVD"
4,Flower Drum Song,"Hi everyone,I think this is a very underrated musical. Dated, but fun dated with great dance numbers and very fun performances. I'm so pleased that they finally released it in widescreen. As a San Francisco resident, I've never seen Grant Avenue look so wide (and never will). The film is a bit long, but the opening overture is fantastic and beatiful to see on our large screen TV."
1,Mediocre,"This movie is terrible compared to the other Rogers and Hammerstein musicals. I love musicals and have seen pretty much all of the Rogers and Hammerstein movies. But this one was terrible in comparison. First of all, two of the actor's voices were dubbed. The white balance was off; sometimes the screen was to blue, and sometimes too yellow. Plus, the color was oversaturated. The plot was unsettling, and it changed so fast without graduating and building up to changes in the plot. The songs were not very good either; I just saw it and I cant remember the tunes to most of them. The sound was funny and wasn't very high quality. I do not recommend this movie if you are accustomed to the classic songs of the other Rogers and Hammerstein movies."
5,Flower Drum Song,"Flower Drum SongThis is a classic everyone should have. I love it. I received it with no problems.Thanks,Dana"
5,Excellent story!!!!,"I thought ""The Baker's Boy"" was an excellent tale well told. This book paints a vivid picture in your mind and is relatively easy to read. Anyone looking for an intriguing fantasy story, you've got to read ""The Baker's Boy."" You won't want to put this book down! In fact, I think it deserves ten stars!! Great job Julie!"
3,"Good story, but disjointed.","It is a good story and an easy read. Ms. Jones weaves many subplots, but at the end of the first book they are all still separate threads. We still do not know what Jack is supposed to save the world from, we don't know what happened on Larn, we don't even know if we are supposed to like Melli or Tawl. And how can there be all those tunnels in the castle that no one knows about? I do want to find out what happens with Jack, so I will have to read the next book in the series. One more comment: there are way too many villains here. (I count four.)"
2,"Quite standard, almost","This saga is standard fantasy stuff, one little problem though. All of the hero types are incredibly stupid, and continuously so. If you like to think what you would do, at each twist in the plot, then these books will become very frustrating.I called the main characters heroes, but that's not really true. They are so stupid that every helpful person that they meet suffers horribly because of them, needlessly. After concluding the world would be a better place if all the main characters died, I stopped reading."
5,Book of words,"I was really excited to read the Book of Words Trilogy and so far i have had nothing but great things to say. It is well Written with deep characters both good and evil, an must read for any fantasy fan."
4,Surprisingly Great!!,"After several years of seeing this title floating around, I took a copy home to read. I can't belive it wasn't a best seller.For those of you true fantasy lovers, this is high fantasy at its best. I rarely give 5 stars to anyone, so 4 stars is not a knock in any way. Many modern fantasy authors believe more is better, but many times more is simply rambling on about how many buttons grace the dress a character has or or the exact type of candle sticks in a room. J. V. Jones introduces us to a group of characters we grow to love and care about, without all the rambling of many. She also know sthe correct amount of danger and violence to add without over doing the action. A fine writer and may she go on to finish many more series.Three books was a perfect amount for this series. Always leave your audience waiting for more, not burnt out with what you have to offer."
3,parapa,this is a ok book it is slow and not that good at first but look at this she wrote it in3 days so you can't expect it to be to good
1,DISGUSTING,"Well, here's another female who can't write fantasy. One point that I'd like to point out to all of you is this: this story is NOT ORIGINAL. This is just a CLONE of Tad William's DRAGONBONE CHAIR (part of the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series). And I might add that Dragonbone was written in the early 90's, whereas this was written in the mid-90's. Both storylines are essentially the same--young orphan in a castle has connections with someone higher up, gets involved in adventure, becomes hero, etc, etc, etc. But that was not what really turned me off about this book. J.V. Jones is so DISGUSTING. And I read stuff by the oh-so-controversial Harlan Ellison, too. Why, this book starts off disgusting and doesn't get much better. I've tackled all sorts of fantasy writers--look at my reviews if you don't believe me--and J.V. Jones is absolutely one of the worst. I stopped reading this book before page 100. If you're smart, you'll do the same."
2,There's a *lot* of rape-related stuff in this book... turned me off,"I'm not going to say that this was a bad book, but it was not my cup of tea. It started off with a full on rape scene. Then there was an attempted rape a few chapters later, several pedophilia mentions, then another attempted rape scene - I dunno. Maybe I'm overly sensitive- I had the same reaction to Stephen R. Donaldson's stuff, for the same reason, and a lot of other people love his work. I should mention that they're not horribly graphic, but still.Additionally, this book (at least as far as I got, I put it down about 100 pages in) very much followed standard fantasy plot lines - which would have been fine, I read eddings, jordan, feist and dug all their stuff even though they're all fairly formulaic - but the characters didn't feel fleshed out enough for me to care.Quick Summary:+ too many rape & semi-rape scenes+ characters don't have depth+ formulaic"
1,a painful read,"the book starts with one of the best prologues i've ever read. it's all downhill after that. the heroes are annoying and spend 95% getting their a**es kicked, whining, crying about the past.far more interesting are the villians. tavalisk could be excellent -- unfortunately his parts all follow the same pattern.any book where i long to see the heroes executed for stupidity and being so insufferably un-original can't be given more than one star.one good point: i actually liked all the sex & violence -- it set it apart from other fantasy i have read. this includes the all too infrequent scenes with bodger and grift, which are hilarious.julie jones, while by far the best looking fantasy writer i have ever seen, is no Robert Jordan."
4,Pretty good really,A good storyline with an intricate plot with a bit more realism that is usual in some author's work. A realism that appears to have upset some readers. But anyway the plot is generally familiar in this genre but the still has enough suprises to be a good read. Enjoyed the tales of the two soliders especially and wish that some of the other characterisation could have been as good instead of jumping quite so quickly between characters. Overall worth the cash.
4,A great start for an excellent new author,"After an amazing prologue The Bakers Boy proved to be a most enjoyable read. I found the characters to be likeable, realistic and not run-of-the-mill , especially Baralis. Definately a man you will love to hate! The book has plenty of suspense and loads of humour in Bodger and Grift, whose words of wisdom once heard should never be followed! All in all a good start, Julie Jones writes extremely well and certainly has great flair and style. My only criticism is that Jack and Melli seemed to spend all their time escaping and then getting caught again, however the settings are excellent and the plot is otherwise very engaging. And believe me the series just gets better and better."
3,Dang it...amazon was right...,"they are prophets... they predicted that I would rate it three stars... and I did, even though I didn't want too!!Well, I have just read this bok for the second time, and I must say that it was even better the second time around. But it left me just as mystified, and wanting to know a great deal of many characters, like Falk... who is he!?Well I can clearly recommend it to those who like intrigues and the not-so-hero-ish character... and of course some classical and not-so-classical bad guys...Enjoy it!"
1,Terrible,I never received this product. There was no reply from the seller after three contact tries.
4,GLOSS,"It's a really cool track,if you love Nina Persson from the Cardigans ,you will like the British band,try to listen to them."
4,Pigs Might Fly Review,Pigs might fly was an OK book. It ended up to be better than I thought it was going to be.
4,"Funny, but Could Have Been Better","I'm leaving it at that, as I don't have much to say about it. Shuichi was pretty much an annoying fangirl throughout the anime. I liked the entire thing well enough to give it at least four stars, though."
1,cord,"My sister-in-law-to-be broke the cord as soon as she plugged it in. It wasn't very durable for her, but it could have just been her. Who knows."
5,Reminds me of real life,"This is a very good movie and emotional at times as well. Yes, it has its sexual parts, but this movie shows what many people around the world face today with being who they are. I recommend it for anyone, whether you are gay or straight."
4,"A solid product, but difficult to put away","This is a great product. Very solid and well-made. But what should have been an easy project of packing it up for the winter just didn't work for us. We tried everything but couldn't get it back into a smaller size to store for the winter. So it sat all winter on the back porch, cumbersome, bulky and definitely in the way. I think if there had been instructions of some kind on how to pack it up, it would have been helpful. Once I get it set back up, I think I'll leave it in place."
1,This Book is a disgrace to mathematics,This book was completely useless and udderly boring in the help of studying for Mathematics.
3,Acceptable,kind of watery- not a thick gel like others that I've tried but ok for the money.just enough to get on firewood
4,Very entertaining,"A delightful film from Singapore with english spoken dialogue. A spoof of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" thats full of humor and fun.A great rental and fun one to own."
3,Karate and Disco-How cool is that!!??,"I loved this movie! It was a little quirky, and though predictable at times, did contain some great surprises, and, of course, some awsome dancing. How many movies can combine karate and disco in such a cool way? This movie offers a unique twist on east meets west. It's definitely one that I would watch again."
3,decent..needs some proofreading,"I'm not discouraged by this book or anything...it is a pretty good book in terms of explaining the material so you are not completely confused and the questions are good. However, I found mistakes in the book that could really depress you (like giving the wrong answer on the practice tests) and some other things. I just sort of lost trust in the book so I would recommend the kaplan to those taking this test."
4,Good overall review,"This book provides an excellent overall review. However it is very simplistic and does not cover some things in depth. I prefer the more in depth Kaplan book, but some people find the layout of the Princeton to be easier to read. Currently this is the 2nd best SAT II book available after the Kaplan."
2,"Good if you've never, ever picked up a biology book","It's simple and to the point. It's great if you are not so well versed in biology, or there's a concept that you don't understand. I used this only to do the latter. If there was something I didn't understand from my textbook I went and looked it up. If your looking for a last minute review this book is also for you. If not then go get the barrons. People say the barrons book is not that great because it contains too much information. Would you rather buy a book that had too little? Then you just end up wasting your money and buying another book. Get the barrons. All lot of it isn't seen too often, but I was surprised when some topics I thought wouldn't be on the tes were."
3,Not Up To Par,"I bought this book about two months before the SAT II exam, and although I didn't study consistently, I reviewed all of the material in the book, the depth depending on how much I was comfortable with. I took the practice tests and scored 620 and 630, and on the actual day of the test I got a 580, I found it to be ALOT harder than the practice tests they had given, and half of the material was not covered in the book. This book is basically a generalization of the stuff you need to know, so I wouldn't reccomend to anyone trying to learn alot. Personally, I would reccomend Barron's..."
4,"Simple to Read, Informative enough for basics","This book is a really easy to read book as it has short notes, many pictures, less wordings, and suggestions for each different wine.Like the title, it lives up to the name. Too often, our problem is choosing the right wine for minimum dollar we pay. This book makes things much simpler. It offers the very basics of wine making and appreciation, and also goes right to the things we need and want to know. Also, how to prevent looking like a fool in a restaurant when you are trying to impress your date.All in all, I think this is a good book to look at if you want one to impress people with the wine you bought from the grocer, but if you want to impress people with knowledge of wine, find a thicker and more detailed book."
4,Oklahoma--a beautiful state,"As a (nearly) native Oklahoman, I am constantly trying to dispel the belief of non-Okies that Oklahoma is a red-neck, goat-roping wild West state with little of beauty--this book was a tremendous help! The photographs of David Fitgerald are spectacular and make me want to explore the state more fully! It is a lovely adornment on a coffee table or in a glass bookshelf. The only thing keeping me from rating the book with 5 stars is that it lacks a bit of history and information about the locations photographed."
5,classic east bay punk,"This is a classic cd you should definitly listen to. Crimpshrine is the inspiration for many awesome punk bands such as Operation Ivy. They sound kind of like an angrier OpIvy without the ska element.. It takes a little while to get used to the hoarse vocals and harsh sound, but you will eventually grow to love them. Also, the drummer is somewhat fantastic."
1,Great idea - rendered USELESS by poor quality build.,"The work JUNK is used repeatedly in the reviews regarding this product. Junk captures the correct attitude one should take in assessing this, but it needs another adjective. Disappointing junk. Frustrating junk. Aggravating junk. Something like that. This was a gift my wife bought me when I got out my old telescope and refitted it in preparation for renewing my old astonomy hobby. The Power Tank would run the astro GPS unit, power the mount and generally contribute to the experience. It did none of that. It worked for about the first month, then it simply died. Every time I tried to recharge it, it simply blinked off. Unfortunately, I got involved in other things and I did not try to revive the unit until much later. I tried a new power supply - same behaviour as described by so many others.I threw it in the trash. That's where it belonged.My advice. Simply DON'T BUY THIS. If you do buy it - DON'T DEPEND ON IT.It WILL fail."
5,~A GREAT C.D~,Eric Topper is a great artist. His voice is very full of emotion and creativity. I would recomend this C.D to all.
2,Only a few songs make me put this CD back in my CD player.,"I was disappointed with this CD. I am a contemporary R&B lover -- favoring the likes of Erykah Badu, Chico DeBarge, N'Dea Davenport, D'Angelo, Maxwell, Davina, etc. I figured Angel's CD would wow me like those mentioned above, but she's a little too bizarre. I just can't get with Om and other tracks like it. Kisses Luv Lips is cool, but for the most part, I like to be able to put on a CD and play the whole thing -- not skip, skip and skip around. Angel, I think you're on the right track (by being different than mainstream), but better luck next time (if there is a next time) at actually hitting the mark."
5,Fabulous,These boots are fabulous! They fit my son very well and are perfect for those cold winter months.
4,Good quality!,"This booties are made really well, soft and warm for the little feet. The only thing that I don't like is the elastic, it is too tight and leaves prints on my baby's feet.I would recommend this product for babies with small and thin feet."
5,Great Product!,"These are great! Fabulous! Easy to put on, warm; my child is 18 months and will not take them off! Love to use while shopping and even around the house. My son has wide feet, and these fit comfortably.Well worth the price.Definitely washable. Just flip inside out and let sit to dry. Important with a toddler!!!"
2,Not worth It,Bought this spray thinking it would help keep mosquitos away from my two boxers. Doesn't really help at all. Totally disappointed.
5,Brotherhood of Dwarves,"I'm not usually a reader of fantasy, but this book goes well beyond what I expected. I feel like I've grown up with the characters. Great action, great drama, and a few unexpected twists puts this book near the top of my list of all time favorites. I'm glad the sequels are finally out!"
3,It was rushed into publication...,"Overall this is a pretty decent study guide, however, certain content indicates that it may have been rushed to the printer before a thorough tech review. There are numerous errors in the CertTrainer quizes and some of the content is either confusing, incomplete, or blatantly incorrect. Examples include beginning to discuss Demand Dial configuration and never completing the config in RRAS and the explanation of the relatively simple concept of ARC pathnames used in the boot.ini. I used this study guide to pass the 70-244 exam and the topics discussed in the book do a fairly good job of covering what was on the test. My exam was a bit heavier on IIS than what was covered. With a little polish this guide could have been great."
3,Good enough to pass the exam,"The reason I prepared for this exam was because I did not have much NT4 experience. There are not as much study guides available for this exam as there are for others.I decided to go for Syngress because I enjoyed their other publications.Overall this book does a good job but there are errettas in the book and on the CD. If you can spot them it means you know the stuff. The .avi clips on the cd are really good.I don't think enough proof reading has been done before the publication. Otherwise the demand-dial part in RRAS would have been completed.This book is enough to pass, even if you don't have much experience. Just check the MS website for some white papers.It's not an easy exam IMO"
2,Expected More,"I bought this book based on raving recommendations in a genealogy book. I was having trouble managing all my materials and thought this would give me some new forms for things I was struggling with (like passenger lists). Instead, I got a lot of standard forms that I already had. I expected a better selection of forms instead of many copies of one form."
3,"Pretty Good, Not DePaola's Best","Tomie dePaola states in the liner notes that Oliver's story is partly autobiographical. ""I could spend hours drawing, and nobody ever asked me to play on their ball teams because I was so bad at it.""Oliver's pursuits are less than gender-appropriate in the eyes of his male peers. He enjoys dancing, dressing up, acting, reading, and drawing. His father doesn't approve, either, but his mother and his female peers come to his aid. This help, however, works to Oliver's detriment: ""Gotta have help from girls,"" the boys say teasingly. In the end Oliver, however, Oliver succeeds on his own terms.This testimony to being oneself was written in 1979, and includes dePaola's signature drawings using a limited color palette. Though it isn't as charming as the Strega Nona books, it effectively delivers its message."
2,paper!,paper paper paper its 2010 we are still useing paper in speakers sounds ok i fell like i will blow them becuz of the paper but for paper it sounds ok and for 12 bucks i guess its ok if u only hook them up to ur deck dont use a amp the paper!
3,Small but gets the job done,"Don't expect to hang a whole bunch of heavy clothes. Not sturdy enough for sweatshirts/pants or towels right out of the dryer.This product works great for smaller items and performance wear. This lasted me for the short time period I needed it ( <6months).Stability leaves some to be desired, and you may find it flimsy, but it's pretty cheap. Looking for a long-term clothes dryer? My advice is shell out for something better.Also note, the only wood portion are the sides. The ""hangars"" running through are not wood."
4,Excellent Stand,"I have a standard long neck guitar stand that I have my acoustic placed upon now. I have my electric on this stand and it is very stable, looks clean, and I like how it works. Would definitely go with this type of stand in the future."
1,NICE STAND SMELLS TERRIBLE,"GOT STAND AND LOVED THE WAY IT WORKED AND FIT. ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER NOTICED HOUSE SMELLED LIKE CREOSOTE/BAD,BAG WAS NEXT TO COUCH AND PICKED IT UP AND SURE ENOUGH IT SMELLED, CHECKED STAND AND RUBBER USED FOR PADS SMELLS HORRIBLE PUT OUTSIDE FOR THREE DAYS AND STILL STINKS. KNOW MY $2000.00 LES PAUL STINKS ALSO, BAD EXPERIENCEOnStage GS7462B Folding Guitar Stand"
3,Disappointing,"Always on the look-out for good Celtic bands, I took a chance on this album and ended up disappointed. While the instrumental work is solid and Aimee Leonard's voice is pleasant, the lyrics are mediocre at best and the overall impact of the album is ""ho hum"". If you want a superb mix of traditional and contemporary music, I'd recommend Capercaillie's recent work."
4,Household notebook,To j griffin:organizedhome.com has a free household notebook you can print out. They also give information on how to set one up and how to tailor it to YOUR family's needs. This site also has lots of great home management information. Check it out!
2,Outdated and full of mistakes,"The last printing of this book is 2004. The information is dated. The answer keys are full of errors. Until I take the certification test, I can't be too certain of the quality of this book, but I can be certain that a copy editor was needed before publication. At this point, I feel I've wasted my money simply because of the numerous errors in the book."
1,A very poor choice for a lens,A very poor choice for a lens. Would not recommend this lens unless it comes with a generous return policy.Lens is not sharp & has very poor contrast.
2,Very disappointing,"I don't mind if an author rehashes an old story, but only if it's good! I had to make myself finish this one. Both romances in the story were boring. The main female character is just plain stupid. She has no valid reason for her conflict with the hero.I, too, wish Ms. Wolf would write some more regencies, but not if the story line is no better than this one."
2,maybe she should retire,I'm a huge Madonna fan for like many many years. This cd has no real remixes. The cover is cool but otherwise not so good. Maybe if there was like 15 remixes on 2cds or something. I don't know why I bought it. Her american life is also not that good except for like 3 songs.
5,A REMIX that all should own !,"Madonna is a true artist. Her material can be transported and rejuvinated with time. The tracks on this remix are a perfect example of great pop/dance songs. Britney should pay closer attention to this master of the pop arena. This remix edition is worth the cash! Also note that the added track, ""YOUR HONESTY"" is pure MADONNA (""DOING A COMOTION"") 1980s !"
2,Uhh...am I alone here?,"I was HUGELY disappointed by this album. Perhaps I'm confused, but I've always thought the point of a remix was to put a ""new and improved"" spin on a song, or at least a ""new and as-good-as-the-original"" spin. None of these remixes comes CLOSE to the originals. They're just plain...dull and pointless, merely remixes for the sake of remixing. The inclusion of the MTV Video Music Awards performance is a strange choice: without the dancing and visual decorations, it's just an overly long, anticlimactic remix with a lot of screaming in the background. The GAP commercial remix, although fun, seems really silly out of context. Listening to Missy Elliott rap about jeans without actually watching her and Madge bling-blingin' and fooling around is just plain awkward. The one upside to this album? The unreleased song, ""Your Honesty,"" is a thumping, simple piece of the type of fun, carefree pop that has always been Madonna's strong suit."
2,Ay Madonna!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a mega fan, BUT I have bought this yet, I dont know anymore, seems my girl is in another world. (Desperete) Ill just wait for a new album and this time i will expect madonna to put more effort in it to sell and chart. Im tired of reading all this bad reviews that shes done."
2,OUTRAGED & BORED,"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS MADONNA DOING THIS DAYS ???I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR WHAT TWIST SHE HAD MADE ON HER NOT SO LIKEBLE 'AMERICAN LIFE' DISSASTER AND WOW ...THIS HAS TO BE THE LOW MOMENT OF WHAT USED TO BE THE MOST SUCCESFUL FEMALE MUSICAL GENIUS, CAUSE IS CLEAR THAT SHE IS AS CONFUSED AS WE FANS ARE, THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT MUSICAL GENRE SHE REALLY WANTS TO FOLLOW, THIS IS NOT ROCK, IS NOT ELECTRONICA IS NOT EVEN POP ANYMORE.WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND ENERGY ON THIS DULL AND STUPID EP.TAKING UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT SHE HAS BEEN A PIONEER AND TRENDSETTER WHEN IT COMES INTO NEW SOUNDS AND BEATS FOR THE WORLD OF POP AND TAKING THAT SHE HAS WORKED WITH AN A LIST OF DJ'S AND PRODUCER, YOU WOULD EXPECT A SUPERB EP OR MIXED CD, BUT NOW, SHE IS STILL ON HER 'AMERICAN LIFE' TRIO AND SHE THEN COMES OUT AGAIN WITH A HORRIBLE COMPILATION OF REMIXES THAT ARE JUST TRAGIC?FOR GOD SAKE MADONNA ... GET A CLUE!"
4,This EP ROCKs!!,"Although I haven't recieved my cd yet from amazon I did hear it at vh1.com. The remixes from American Life are amazing! The Headcleaners rock mixes of Love Profusion and American life are totally rock/pop metal sounding which gives the songs a whole new edge. These are my two faves. The Nothing Fails remix is good and the Nobody Knows Me remix has an 80's synth pop sound which I really dig. Following these is the live performance from this years MTV music awards which is pretty cool. However, not the biggest fan of the Into The Hollywood Groove which is a bit boring and Your Honesty, the unreleased track from Bedtime Stories(1994) just isn't what I am into anymore. This album is definitely worth having though for the American Life remixes. I totally recommend it! Thanks!"
3,"Not bad, but not that good either.","After waiting a long time for a remix CD, this one is a bit of a disappointment. The remixes are pretty good, notably the American Life rock version, which is great. The first two tracks are good also. The Like A Virgin/Hollywood live performance is a bit of a novelty and the Into the Groove/Hollywood remix is fun for a while. I didn't think much of Your Honesty, recorded originally for Bedtime Stories. A bit cheeseball. I think it could have included some remixes of other songs, but hey, this one is OK. Check out the Love Profusion / Nobody Knows me remix CD too, particulary the last track of Nobody Knows Me. It's great."
2,Ok but only for FANATIC FANS!,"I think Madonna should try something NEW. She needs some MATURITY. Hey Madonna you are not like Britney anymore, remenber that you are 46 years old. A lady should be more serious about her life and work. I know you could do better. Do it and I will respect you. Talk with Cyndi Lauper maybe she could advise you!!!!"
2,Nothing New Here,"My cousin works for the MSG venue, and the truth is they were left with thousands of empty seats and unclaimed tickets ranging as low as $50.00 a pop for Madonna's scheduled shows there. She's struggling to stay relevant more now than ever. I never had a real opinion of her. There are so many other acts that have the voice and the charisma that will be sticking around a lot longer than she will. This latest EP she put out is not exactly ground breaking and neither is the AL CD. She's a somewhat limited and average vocalist, with nothing new to offer in music."
5,Great shoes,I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They were a little tight across the bridge but they loosened up after the first wear. We looked locally and on the internet for this size and Amazon had the best price. The shipping was so fast too. Would recommend these & Amazon.
3,short last season with rushed ending,"The premise of Jericho really intrigued me but this 2nd season is a disappointment of sorts.#1 - it's the last season - I guess it didn't do to well in the ratings.#2. the 2nd season is alot shorter than the first season.#3. with those 2 things going against it - this 2nd season tries to wrap up the series with a conclusion (which is admirable) but unfortunately for me it is rushed and things happen so quickly that when the ending does come and the credits roll I was left sitting there saying to myself ""..this is it??"". Disappointing.I wish this program would've ended up on ABC back to back with Lost - that would've been a really great 1-2 punch for the network and great entertainment for viewers but unfortunately CBS aired this and not alot of people watch CBS - so this series withered rather quickly."
4,Great watch,I am old enough to have come to the point of accepting that all good things come to an end. This series is one that ended too soon. I was contemplating getting the comic series just to see what was next. Great quality DVD. Non-typical storyline.
5,Great show ~ waiting for the Movie,"Great story, cast, plot ~ why did it have to end so soon. They did a fantastic job with the time allowed and left me wanting more. I hope they make the movie!"
2,RLB,"The 'high tech straight-eight' picture on page 73 should be interchanged with the 'supercharged superlative' picture on page 77 to reduce confusion; some confusion still exists in the page titles and text. Pages 74-75 are all about the model J, but the car shown is an SJ (unless specified otherwise the flex exhaust pipes go with the supercharged engine). Page 72 is titled model J, but the yellow car is an SJ.Aside from confusion in photo and text layout the grouping into five views, milestones, under the skin, and specs provides concise and useful info.RLB"
1,It's obvious...,"I haven't bought the cd, and don't intend to. Why you may ask? Well, though i own both jordan and joe's albums, Danny, in my opinion was the least talented out of the nkotb, along with jon. Now, on the other hand, i think he's good for just background harmonies with the group, but he doesn't have the talent to stand out, and shouldn't have made a solo cd. If Donnie makes a solo cd, i'll probably be interested in checking it out, at least he could rap pretty good, though he was absent some on the face the music cd."
1,Didn't like,"Low budget, I expected that. Just couldn't watch for more than 5 minutes. Looked like it was made by a college student."
4,Parking area light,This light bought to replace one just like it (original damaged beyond repair). The unit is easy to mount and provides good lighting. The plastic guard surrounding the bulb is rather lightweight and subject to breakage. Overall it's a good value.
2,not so screamin',"It is sort of sad that this well titled Swansong should be such a disapointment. I am a serious fan of this underated blues legend, but I must say that since I bought this back in 98 I have hardly played it at all, and hold on to it just to preserve my collection. A few tracks are enjoyable, especially his version of I SHOT THE SHERRIF, but overall this is a bummer. Although I liked SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON and absolutely loved STONE CRAZY, I still have to stand by the old cliche of ""his older stuff was better"" because in this case it is true.P.S. Rest in peace, Screamin' Jay, you continue to put a spell on us all."
5,"Wow,it lasted more than a year","Black & Decker did a great service when making this drill with rechargeable battery, my friend bought me one for Christmas in the year 1998 and lasted till now, I just can't believe it. Now looking for another battery and can't FIND even one???? What to do???Does anyone know where I can get another battery for my drill, Black and Decker ,,,Master Mechanic #TV293 MM 12V Battery Pack please let me know. Mr. J.A."
5,"Kudos for ""Teach Your Dog to Behave""","Bash Dibra's ""Teach Your Dog to Behave"" covers all the problems a dog owner encounters -- and tells how to solve them! The dictionary format makes finding the answers easy as a-b-c! Dibra's newest book belongs in every dog-owner's library."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH iPhone 3G!!,"This product absolutely DOES NOT WORK with the iPhone 3G as claimed, if you try it you will get a message on screen saying that it is incompatible and will not charge it!!"
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"While this book contains a few useful tips, they are rare; anyone with common sense could figure out the rest. The author also assumes a certain level of affluence, so students and budget travelers should look elsewhere. Furthermore, the more practical -minded would probably find her packing advice and clothing tips ludicrous."
5,very satisfied!,"We bought a Simmons Beauty Rest Sleep massager and couldn't be more satisfied with it! We had been looking for a bed massager for a few months since our last one had 'died'. I suggested to my husband, who originally purchased the massager from a discount store years before, that he should check out Amazon. com! Sure enough he found one comparable to the one we had, the kind to fit between the box spring and mattress, so he bought it! Even though the Simmons' massager vibrated the entire bed, I wanted my own controls, so we bought another one! It lolls us to sleep very nicely. I especially like the feature of having two units, it allows more options; one placed for the upper body and the other for lower torso. It's great! I'm glad we bought it through Amazon. com because the price was right, too! thank you, Amazon.com!"
4,Good Value,"I have a Speedglas and a Hobart hood. I decided to try one of these from all the good reviews. The only thing I don't like about it, is there is no adjustment for the highth in the down position. The sweatband is even removable and washable, my speedglas that I paid $239.99 for doesn't even have that! Try one, you'll like it."
2,Poor quality control,One of the bulbs burned out after 1 month. I will not buy this brand again. Don't waste your money. Get another brand.
2,Hovercraft,I purchased two hovercraft. They were both on same frequency. My kids could not race them or use them at the same time because of they were on same frequency. I called Discovery and they said I could return them. I have returned them but have received a refund yet.
5,"Great rythms, great guitars, and great harmonies","No gimmicks here... just great straightforward rock music from Tempe, Arizona. Its too bad this album wasn't released on Columbia Records because it is chalk full of hits like ""Ernesto's"" and ""Touching Perfect"". If you like bands like the Refreshments, Gin Blossoms and Cracker... give these guys a shot... you won't be sorry."
2,Would not recommend EVER,"I don't recommend this toy for a number of reasons. 1) My 4 children (son included) LOVE Polly Pocket, but this ship is definitely not worth the price tag. 2) The way it folds together is wonderful for storage, but a nightmare to get opened and closed; the children can't do it themselves. 3) Many of the items continually pop out of place (ship's railings, handgliding chair, slide, knob to hold the ship closed for storage, etc). And 4) You have to remove items that snap into place to close the ship. Over time, they will no longer stay in place due to wear from constant removal (especially when they aren't very reliably secure from the start).Honestly, my children are still thrilled with it and love it. There is just a constant call for Mom to come and open it, set it up, fix something that has popped off, fold it up, fix something that has popped off, etc etc."
3,takes a long time to set up,"I spent a small fortune on this. My daughter really wanted it for Christmas. She gets it and when she gets it out to play with it, it REQUIRES a much older child, or adult to help set it up, every time. By the time she gets all the tiny little pieces set in place, she's DONE. This has only been played with about 3 times in 7 months."
4,My Daughter Loved It,"My 6 year old daughter has a ton of Polly Pocket items but this by far is her favorite. The only problem we had was with closing it up, we had trouble getting everything to fit back in before we closed it. But overall she loved it & has had hours of fun with it."
4,excellent toy,my 5 year old daughter loves this toy. we did not have to put a bunch of pieces together with this one and it comes with a lot of additions!
4,"My husband, the flying ace fanatic, LOVED it!","This is a wonderful video for you flying fanatics, especially those of you who follow the grandeur and the sheer gutz of ""The Red Baron"" himself. I wanted my husband to write this after viewing the video, but he is actually too busy watching it over and over again! Yes, he is quite the flying fan - so much so that our entire livingroom reeks of the subject! I even bid on a wonderful color pencil portrait of The Red Baron by artist Gary Nichols, but unfortunately, I did not win it for my husband's birthday gift. So, I ended up getting him this video instead! If you're into the history of flying and The Baron, you will surely love this video. And, if you're anything like my husband, you will watch many times in a row! Marjorie VanGuilder"
1,Didn't work,"Light seemed fine in testing setting, but would continuously come on for no apparent reason throughout the night. Tossed it and replaced with a Heath-Zenith."
4,"Great Live Album, but little disappointed","In Feb. 1970 the original Fleetwood Mac line up with Peter Green recorded three nights at the legendary Boston Tea Party. Vol. 1 serves up a generous 69 minutes of live music with a couple of extended jams (Rattlesnake Shake at 25 mins. and Green Manalishi at 12 mins.). I'm a huge fan of the blues and early Fleetwood Mac, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the CD. While I think it is a great show, the recording catches the band at a point of tradition. Peter Green was starting to turn away from traditional blues and becoming more experimental pushing the Blues format in a new direction. That's fine and the music is great, but for folks looking for a live version of their original work this is not it. I much preferred English Rose and the album they did with Otis Spann. If I was to rate this as a prue blues album it would be only 3 stars. As a music fan that appreciates live music I give it 4 stars."
2,This CD does not represent the true dynamic of Fleetwood Mac,This CD by Fleetwood Mac is a real dissapointment. It is poorly recorded and the songs are neither dynamic nor familiar. I would not recommend this because it does not properly reflect the feel and musical harmony of a Fleetwood Mac concert.
1,Way too coarse!,This is not a scythe stone; it's a grinding stone. I bought a real stone from Scythe Supply. I use this one to sharpen my rotor tiller tines.
2,Where's the handle?,"All the sythe stones I have ever seen have a wooden handle attached. If you try to sharpen the blade while on the snath, you can easily cut your hand. The only way to safly use this stone is to remove the blade, put it in a vice and use the stone wth TWO hands, wearing gloves! With the blade in a vice, a file is MUCH quicker and safer. Don't waste your money on this product."
4,worked okay,Worked okay to get rid of moths in conjunction with a thorough clean and keeping all food in oxo boxes.
4,Great Bible for new believers,I choose the 4 star rating because I gave this Bible to my 7 year old granddaughter as a Thanksgiving present. She read Proverbs in the morning and again before bedtime. She is very proud of this Bible. The wording makes it easy for her to understand and ask questions for clarifications.I suggest this Bible to new believers and a great stocking stuffer for family members who aren't practicing christians.
3,"No matter what, it is an AIR bed","After reading all those wonderful reviews on Amazon, I bought the queen-size air bed because my mum was coming to visit me. This is the third air bed I have owned and my first two are Colemans which sucks big time. In general, this Simmons is built with good quality, at least it doesn't leak. The pump is easy to use and is effective enough even though I wish it could be more powerful. However, an air bed is just an air bed. It can't compete with my regular bed in comfort level. I prefer very firm mattress and I feel I am not getting enough support for my spine from it. That said, the firmness provided by it is pretty good considering it is an air bed.In summary, this is a good product but, is it worth almost $80 that I paid? I will say no"
1,Bad air mattress,The mattress leaked the first time I inflated it. The design of keeping air locked in the mattress is bad. I would not recommend to buy this product at all.
3,"For the price, not worth it","I bought this air matress making an assumption about quality, I was paying more therefore I would get more. Instead the matress did little more than keep me up off the ground and my back ached just like all air mattresses seem to do. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the pump that came with it is the best one I have ever had for an air matress. Since I had to sleep on it for a week while I had visitors I ordered a plush memory foam topper for it. Thats what finally made this bearable. Not impressed with the price at all."
5,Excellent Book to get a higher score on TOEFL iBT!!,This is the one and only book you need to take the TOEFL IBT if you already have an intermediate or advanced English Level. It contains a CD-ROM with 4 complete practice tests (very similar to the real one). It also has the sample answers of the Speaking Practice. I used it two weeks before taking the test for he first time for and I got 115 out of 120. Great Book! Very useful :)
4,"Worked, but lacking some details","I used this to connect a new radio (Sony CDX-GT700HD) to my 1999 Ford Explorer XLT (which was actually constructed in mid-1998). It worked fine and plugged right in to the car's connector.However, the package labeling is not completely accurate. There was a cable with an orange jacket with black stripe and the package did not say what it was. I left it off (open) and it didn't seem to matter. Also, there is a black with white stripe cable that says it is the ground, but I used the frame ground and it didn't line up with the new stereo. I did the same with it. One day, I'll look at the Explorer's wiring diagram and determine what these really are for.But everything seemed to work for my vehicle so all is well that ends well."
5,Good Harness,This harness fit my 1998 Ranger XLT. It was a great harness and i would recommend to anybody needing a harness for their 98&up ford!
2,Formulaic,"After writing 23 novels (a supreme accomplisment), AB's fiction has become formulaic; this is another emotional novel about a forlorn and isolated English woman, who fails to find love. Emma Roberts leaves home after her mother dies and lives briefly in Paris, returning to England and ultimately buying her own apartment, which could help her establish her own identity. But she doesn't do it, due to her weak nature and her penchant for being on the outside looking in at the other people in her life, including the French woman she befriends who finally marries and has a child. Emma ultimately completes her book on classic French gardens, a minor subplot hardly developed, with scant information on them. I call this book formulaic, because it deals with familiar themes, but it's actually alot weaker than the others, because Emma is a dim character with an uninteresting life along with the other characters in the book. I used to love her books so much, and now I wonder."
3,Cheap door chime..,"Nothing fancy here, just a basic white plastic box that chimes when you press the button. Can be installed easily using common sense, but it would be nice if the installation instructions refer to this particular chime, and not some other one."
5,Neat gadget,I like the cyber pad. It is as advertised and it works well. I am not reviewing it again.
4,Great Product,"I wanted an affordable product that would allow me to transfer handwritten class notes to my computer. This does exactly that. The cyberpad works wonderful for what I use it for. I haven't tried it as a tablet and probably won't. My only suggestions to the manufacturer would be to add a Mac OS driver and to add a lock key for the side buttons, as I am forever accidentally hitting them and changing pages."
4,Great Cliffsnotes!,These Cliffsnotes have definitely helped me as a student to understand the book. It can get hard to read if you're a younger person who doesn't know much about the language Charles Dickens used.
5,very good,I thought this was a great book. It was a really good summery on great expectations. I know how some people get really confused when reading books like this because it is sometimes hard to understand the language. So I highy reccomend this book.
2,NOT Leak Proof,"One of the reviewers said that these must be used for storage and not the metal lids because the metal lids are only air tight when canned. I totally disagree. These lids are not air tight because they leak liquid. The metal lids seal way better, but with that being said I did not buy mine to store food with anyway.I bought mine to drill a hole in so I can insert a straw. They are a fantastic way to turn a mason jar into an adult ""sippy"" cup. Now I can take my smoothie to work in the morning.So they fail for what they are designed for, but they work for my needs and I just bought another set."
3,Lid Reviews,"I am not too much of a fan of these, but it is better than using the metal lids because the rust. You don't want rusty lids on your jars for many reasons. The reason I am not too huge a fan of these is because they leak liquid from the tops. This does not happen all the time, but it is frequent enough that you will have to make sure that your jars are not sideways in your bag, so your jars must stand up at all times, and the lids will work effectively."
3,"Great for dry ingredients, terrible for liquids","These are pretty good for storing things like sugar, rice and other dry goods. The are not good for liquids at all. Since I wanted the lids to take beverages with me as well as storing my dry baking goods these are only half as useful as I wanted them to be. I was going to buy more and buy some wide mouth but I think the old lid used for canning will do just as well and costs me nothing. Nice idea. Not so much on execution. I hope there is a liquid tight option out there somewhere."
1,leak like there's no lid at all,These are the worse lids ever. They leak so bad it's as if there is no lid at all. I'm using these with Ball brand wide mouth jars so you would think they would be a good match. They are not.
3,meh... ok for dry storage,"Despite the description I read before buying, these lids do not create a watertight seal on the jars. Liquids WILL leak if placed on their sides. That said, if you use them for dry goods or for liquids that are stored upright, say, in the refridgerator, they work ok. definitely not a replacement for the seal created by the usual metal lids.How hard would it have been to add a rubber seal to these??"
4,Thumbs up!,"I have always hated opening a jar of preserves then having to reuse the lid and ring, such a hassle. This solves the problem. When I open a jar, I replace the two piece lid with one of these. It is convenient and seems to seal well."
4,good product,"I bought these to have a tight seal for storing pantry items and water kefir. Water kefir needs a tight seal to carbonate, and it doesn't get as carbonated as my other containers. But it works nice for my other items"
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased these because I wanted to use my Ball mason jars as water bottles to take to work with me. Problem is that they leak so are not good for carrying around in a backpack. I suppose if the only thing you want them for is to cover up a jar of peaches or something for a day in the fridge they might work. But if you want an actual seal, just stick to the metal cap and rings they came with."
4,Always use these,Always use these after popping open a can and needing to save the rest for later. I also use these when making non food items such as scrubs.
4,An absolutely money saver!,"I use these smaller plastic lids for everything, especially tinctures, homemade creams and spice mixtures. If you buy spices and herbs in bulk, these lids are a MUST! I'll definitely buy more of these!I love these jars and they are an excellent alternative to the metal lids necessary for the traditional canning purpose. I primarily use the larger plastic lids for tinctures, juicing (shout out to Dan-The-Man who introduced me to these tops) and decoctions.I've bought about 3-4 packs of these in both sizes and 1 of the tops out of the lot is somehow warped (won't seal tightly). UPDATE: Apparently, this top just doesn't seal as tightly with liquids as it does with dried goods."
4,Great plastic caps,"These caps are essential if you want to use the jars for regular storage. I used these with the 4oz jelly jars and store homemade baby food in them. I haven't had any issues with them, They aren't as sturdy as other plastic caps the come with the store bought jelly or peanut butter but they are already. I dropped one of the jars once and the cap cracked pretty badly, so I do have to be careful with them. Overall I do like them and would buy them again."
1,A fake discount when you consider the exaggerated shipping weight,A box of these lids weighs less than a pound and since they are unbreakable plastic even redundant packing materials would bring the total weight to well under 2 lbs. Since the seller claims they weigh 8.1 pounds the shipping is over $9.00. The money the sellers will keep as profit from the shipping charge is close to $5.00 - more than the price of the lids.
4,They do the job,"I use ball jars for storage, and keep my daughter's re-constituted goat milk in them in the fridge. Just don't shake them with liquid in them - they will leak a little."
3,but what's the exact width?,"This looks exactly like what I'm looking for, but no where, either on this site or on other sites, do they give the width across the top of the lid in inches. I'm looking for a 4"" lid, but nothing anywhere describes these as anything but ""wide mouth"" or regular. Can someone help me out with this please? Only 4"" will do for the glass jars I already have."
4,Good Book,"This book was even better than I expected! I'm not usually into the whole horror genre but the wonderful interaction of the characters (especially Mina and Rob) kept me riveted to Ms. Clay's book. I also liked the fact that not all the vampires were like you see in the movies. Not all of them are perfect or even beautiful in this book. Well done, I hope this becomes a series."
2,already trying to get a new one/Got it,"Finding a double size air mattress to fit the sheets I already owned was tough enough, but i just moved cross-country and wanted to use the air mattress to avoid having to move my bed right away. This morning I contacted the phone number on the warranty because one of the heat-seals on the mattress busted, joining two support compartments and elevating the head of my bed. Before this happened I would have given a four or five star review- the bed stayed inflated all night, my sheets don't slip, nothing squeaked, and it was easy to inflate- now I have to hope that I can get it replaced. This is my second week of law school, I have better things to worry about.Added 6/3: Amazon replaced it for no charge & the new one rocked it"
3,Does it's purpose.,"It really functions well as a walkie talkie. However it does not go 16 miles. I got mine to go 2 miles, no further. So if you are looking for long range I do not suggest this product. But if you are going to stay close it works great and at a great price."
3,i would walk a mile for a filter,"they should have rate the product and then rate the company. i paid about $ 23.00 for the relion ( kaz )humidifier and now dish out$ 13.75 for 2 filters. the "" the filter is fine "" , but it's the price that is unbelievable. but i gotta have it. sorry , all i can say is it's a real shame. don barajas"
5,Exactly as advertised,This was an excellent purchase. Exactly as described and product is exactly like the ones I have purchased from a retail store. Was sent very promptly.
5,great purchase,I prefer to buy these filters for a cool mist humidifier over going to the department store. They last the same and the pack of two are cheaper than Walmart. Great buy for a busy Mom!
1,Broken product and no help from the Co,"Very Simple, Product didn't work and the tech support people from Targus were no help. They said they would send out a replacement componant but they never did. I will never purchase another product from them again."
5,Always good,Pinhead Gunpowder can't do no wrong. Every album is pretty much gold this album is no exception. I like how Billie Joe and Mike vocals really work together. They are so different that it makes the songs really itersting. This is old school Billie Joe before Kerplunk even.
1,Glenn's Review,"Did not receive the pictured bowl. Ordered it specifically for the sloping sides as pictured, but received vertical sides. This is a problem because without the sloping sides my cat pushs his food into the square coeners."
3,Just what I wanted,"Exactly what I wanted. But I did not anticipate that Adler would push the water dish all over the room, keeping the rug damp. Not the bowl's fault, of course."
1,"Numerous ""typos""","Using this workbook for ochem review has been very frustrating. It was not edited well and has numerous errors. I have been using the online forum for clarification, but this hasn't proven to be much better. I wish they would provide a list of errata. There is a forum on the ExamKrackers website that supposedly lists errata, but it's empty. However, in the forum specific to this workbook, I have found numerous answers from their experts that admit the errors (they call them typos, but it's far more severe than a missed key!) They really need to print an updated edition with all the corrections. This one is from 2006 - they've had plenty of time to fix their mistakes. I no longer trust any of the answers and explanations. I wish I had chosen another book for review, but it's too late for me now. DON'T BUY!"
2,Decent,"This book was decent in that it reviewed some of the fundemental concepts necessary for the MCAT. However, most of the questions were too easy, and none resemble the format of an actual MCAT question (not passage based). There were some errors, but easy to identify. The book was worth having for extra practice if you have the money, but don't expect much."
3,dave alvin,Heard so much about him but was disa ppointed with this. Their is music and there is noise and this was the latter.I know he has done far better
2,Tastes bad,"Have tried many of the Atkins bars, these are the worst tasting by far. Buy any of the other ones, they are actually tasty."
4,So far do good,"After reading other reviews on air mattresses I was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed. But it's been over 2 months and so far so good. I sleep on it every night, (I'm buying a real bed when I move in June) and it is holding up."
1,Avoid the kindle version,"My one-star rating refers to the Kindle version only, because the content of the text is decent.The three problems with the Kindle are these: 1) You don't get the CD, without which it is extremely difficult to capture the right sound and timing; 2)Some pages of musical notation cannot be enlarged enough to read, even on my 24"" monitor, and 3) You can't print any of the pages in order to make them legible.My advice is to buy the printed version, and wait for the mail."
3,too much same detailed sex acts,Just a tad too much explanation of the too numerous sex acts between the too. Other than that I enjoyed the book.
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"This is probably my favorite movie ever. But! My favorite part of the entire movie was when Sarah (Christy) sang Desperado!! Why didn't they put it onto the soundtrack??? She was so wonderful, I thought she was better then the Eagles, lol! I am trying to find a way to talk to the people who made this, and have Desperado released. So far, it hasen't worked."
4,Bob Seger Got Kasdan's Attention,"My theory is that Lawrence Kasdan was so taken with Bob Seger's song Let It Shine he concocted a whole movie to be the video track to the song. He uses this song in the center of the movie and again by someone weird ( Lyle Lovett??) I think as the credits roll.This movie is about changing one's life. It is about listening to people. It is about lieing. It has a little skate boarding thrown in, too. What more can one ask."
4,"""Dr."" Mickey Mumford: A Likable Guy","Now here is a different kind of story: a very low-key guy (Loren Dean) pretending to be a psychiatrist in a small town.Dean does a fabulous job of portraying the soft-spoken, easy-going ""shrink"" and is so likable that he makes the film enjoyable.There are a few spots that drag on too long, such as a few scenes with Hope Davis' character but the ""patients"" as a whole are certainly interesting and varied. This is another one of those films that did not get much press, and undeservedly-so because it's pretty entertaining with a good cast. In addition to the above, we see Alfre Woodard, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer, Martin Short and Ted Danson. If you are familiar with those actors, you'll know why a psychiatrist is needed!"
4,Tompall without the Glaser Brothers,"Tompall is the most underrated and least heard of the Outlaw movement that included Waylon and Willie. I rank him right up there with them. I have all of his stuff on vinyl and was so glad when this, along with the 'Put Another Log on the Fire"" compilation was released. He has a fantastic voice and these releases will hopefully introduce him to a whole new generation of fans................ great stuff."
2,Christmas with Nana Mouskouri,"Considering the cost of the album, I was very disappointed. Her voice was beautiful, as usual, but their were too few songs, and I didn't need to hear the same song twice."
4,Drys Fast,The top coat drys pretty fast and has a nice shine. It does get used up quickly though and gets thickly the more you use it.
4,Essential for serious travelers,"I picked this book out of the travel section of the library before I made my long-anticipated trip to Japan. Whereas Jay MacInnerny's ""Ransom"" prevented me from making the same visit ten years earlier, Booth's writing drew me in. I liked this book so much that I devoured it and then went to borrow his other one; ""Looking for the Lost"". Japan is a place where a foreigner will always be an outsider. Booth demonstrates this and still lets his love for the country shine through. It's not a topographical guidemap the way Fodor's does it, but it's just about the best mental preparation study for people who want to see some real Japan. A word of caution: Don't forget that the author's perspective is that of a foreign male living abroad in a testerone rich culture. There is still a woman's story to be told in a Japan travelogue someday, and it will be quite a different tale, I'm sure. Still, I recommend it highly for both genders."
5,Perfect Jasmine aroma,Excellent premium Jasmine tea. Up to stash's usual high quality. Individually foil wrapped.
2,very old fashioned,"As I said before , the only interest is to see the couple Kajol-Ajay Devgan on their early movies ."
2,A suspenseful human experiment,"2 of 5 stars for the psychological suspense movie The Killing Room. In an odd way, this movie reminded me of the movie The Cube; though this is not a sci-fi movie. Four people sign-up for a one day ""research project"". The researchers put them into an observation chamber and start the experiment. I am not going to spoil the movie by describing the experiment or the lame reason for the experiment. The bulk of the movie was watching the subjects go thru the experiment and the last few minutes explained the ""government plot"" behind the experiment. Not a very good suspense movie. Sorry, but, I can't recommend this movie."
5,Excellent Way to teach babies and parents Sign Language,"Lora Heller's book is the best sign language book for kids I've come across. Her pictures and descriptions on how to sign a word are so easy to understand and learn. Her book teaches American Sign Language, not Baby Sign Language which is important to my husband and myself as we not only enjoy teaching our daughter but also enjoy learning it ourselves and are looking forward to continuing. This book has been a great reference guide for us and our 10 month old who just recently signed the words water, more and yes."
4,More than just Bat Boy,"This tabletop book is 6 chapter of ""Best of"" the WWN. While some of my all time favorates are there, some importiant ""News"" articles are missing.For those with a weird sense of humor and that have not heard of the WWN this book provides an ideal introduction to the unique features WWN. Those that are long term followers, this book will bring back memories of some of WWN shining moments."
3,"Intriguing premise, reality-show results","This book visits similar terrain to the DVD ""High Fidelity,"" except that this is a real journey and not fictionalized. The results are unflinchingly honest and will prompt many a reader to ponder whether they would be brave enough to similar revisit their past loves!"
5,perfect for a gift,Very nice to have a positive daily thought. I got one for myself and one for my sister. Very nice item!
5,Playing it by Heart is a real winner!,"Playing it by Heart is an honest, well-written account of Melodie Beattie's unusual life that has many insights that I found interesting and even helpful. Many of them will apply to most people, but especially those who have had to deal with the problem of addiction in themselves or in their family."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I found Yanik Silver's Instant Sales Letters to be of very low value. They are essentially ""fill-in-the-blank"" templates where you insert your product name, description & benefits. Anyone with even a basic understanding of copywriting could do a better job of writing a custom sales letter. I would be embarrassed to send out any one of the letters in this kit. Your money would be better spent on Joseph Sugarman's ""Advertising Secrets"" or Denny Hatch's ""Million Dollar Mailings"". In those two books you see real, proven ads and letters that have sold many millions of dollars of products. Study those winners and you can write outstanding ads and letters on your own."
4,Great entry level product.,"I recently purchsed this set. I had been considering lanscape lighting for several months, but knowing little about it determined to wait until I could afford a complete solution.At the discounted price of $38 this option offered a low risk entry to the technology. I was very happy with the ease of installation and the qty of lights. The lights are plasitic and feel very temporary, but look nice enough. I was able to light up half of my yard, but did have to buy a heavier gauge wire as 100 feet was not quite enough to get the job done.All in all, I purchased another set for the other side of the yard so that is probably as much of an endorsement as needed."
2,Read Amazon Descriptions carefully!,"The only Malibu light set I have ever purchased had a power supply, which also encloses the timer. I saw a set on Amazon, and purchased it. Unfortunately, it does not contain a timer. Merely the power supply (which is listed) which includes a light sensor to automatically turn it on and off. The light sensor is not listed in any manner in the product listing. Not sure this is a Malibu matter, more one for the way Amazon depicts products.

3,I liked how the number was in the title,"When I saw this book, I liked that there was a number in the title and the @ thing too. But when I was reading it, most of the words weren't numbers. Some of the pages were pictures and I liked those ones the best. I think that if you wanted this book, you should get it. As someone who had a hard time in high school, making friends etc., I found this was a good way to think back on it all. I'm not sad anymore because of them."
1,This is of limited use to practitioners in schools.,"The author is a psychologist in private clinical practice with no experience in schools. While it is interesting for those who provide therapy for individuals and groups, there are other books that provide a more useful blend of theory and practice."
5,Perfect!,There are two things I look for in a watch: 1) rectangular face; 2) clean lines. Both were found in this watch - and the extra bonus of rose gold so it matches my new wedding band! I would highly recommend the Stuhrling brand.
4,Stuhrling Woman's watch,I like the looks of the watch and so far it's been pretty good. It has a funky closing link.
1,Odor on Fit Ball Disc O Sit,Odor is horrible. I had to return this product. Nothing I did would eliminate the hideously strong vinyl/chemical odor. My clothing and the entire room smelled like the disc! I even tried washing it. No luck at all.
2,Too many words and not enough charts,"Since technical analysis is mainly about reading stock charts, I'm always amazed when a book meant to teach it is heavy on words and light on charts. This book is far too wordy and not ""charty"" enough. When explaining a concept, the author generally gives one example chart and a lot of words about the chart, rather than giving more examples so that the reader can get a feel for what it being explained. This makes it a very inefficient tool for learning technical analysis, and you may feel you could have used your time better with some other book.A problem for stock and options traders is that the charts and explanations are more oriented toward indexes, orange juice futures, cocoa futures, etc., so it doesn't give much information directly applied to stocks."
4,So far so good,"We have the freezer now for almost two month and so far so good. It arrived well packed and the delivery guy helped nicely to carry it upstairs and unwrap it and even suggested a test run. The freezer reached the cooling temperature quickly, it is pretty silent and the setup with the two casks is nice.The thing I truly missed was something for the temperature measurement, not even a freezer thermometer included. Plus the position of the temperature control knob at the ... bottom left back of the freezer is aweful - and the knob extremely flimsy."
3,"Rita, the gypsy enchantress who took over the leadership of a gang of mountain-dwelling marauders...","The casting of Rita Hayworth as Carmen, the passionate Spanish gypsy who rolls her own cigarettes and picks her own men, was inspired; ""The Loves of Carmen,"" was not...Making lavish use of her considerable charms, physical assets and whatever acting ability was necessary, Rita made her Carmen the most colorful, heartless and hot-blooded screen heroine of the year... Although by this time Rita's mind was on the Riviera, where she was about to embark on the great romantic adventure of her life...Ford was not able to make audiences believe in him as the Spaniard with spoiled love life since his acting forte usually followed a much different romantic approach--Offer the heroine yourself, the prospects of a happy future and a direct sexual approach, open and above-board... And if that fails, a few fast slaps across the chops would usually bring any reluctant heroine to her senses..."
2,What???? I'm lost,"I found this book to be very confusing. I am an avid reader and thought this book had some unreal twists. It took me a very long time to read this one. I think maybe you should see if you could perhaps borrow it from the library or maybe a friend. I really don't think it is worth your money. But hey, that's only my opinion.Denise"
5,Will have you doing background checks....,"When Loved Ones Lie is a great story about a young woman who niavely loses herself in her man--only to find out things arent always what they seem. It is an incredible story of growth as we watch the main character come to terms with the gravity of her situation. This book had me reading at stoplights, at work, everywhere I could steal a minute until I finished. This one comes highly recommended."
3,Great artwork. Basic girl seeks revenge stroy.,"The Legend of Lemnear is pretty much your basic girl seeking revenge. It is nicely done, and the artwork is very good."
3,"Good, but could have been so much better","This anime is actually quite nice and enjoyable to watch. The character designs are great, done by Satoshi Urushihara a famous artist in japan, and the action and visual scope is great. However, the movie suffers from a pretty short running time which makes it feel a little rushed. If the back story had been given full treatment, not just in flashbacks, and if more sub-plots had been included then it could have been great. If you're a fantasy, or action anime fan this is probably good choice. However, if character interaction and a deep plot or more your thing Lemnear is probably not what your looking for."
1,"Disgusting movie with no plot, and horrible characters","This has got to be THE WORST anime I have EVER seen! And I have seen probably almost 1,000 or more hours of anime. The main character spends the whole movie either naked, or in an extremely revealing bikini ""armor"" that wouldn't protect her from a damn flying toothpick! My best friend and I rented this video expecting a shojou anime with an inspiring plot---what we got was multiple scenes of topless women being touched in exptremely inapropriate ways by the ""Bad guy"" . And aside from that there wasn't even a plot! The pathetic attempt at a plot that they had was confusing, hard to follow, incomplete, and utterly stupid. PLEASE DO NOT MUY THIS MOVIE! If I can convince you of ANYTHING let it be that it's an extremely BAD BAD BAD idea to buy this movie. If you want suggestions on Good Animes, E-mail me ( Quistis@onebox.com ), I'll give you a nice long list, just please don't buy this one!"
1,"Too little substance, too much smut...","The vulgar ""Legend of Lemnear"" is one of those anime that gives the Japanese animation is poor reputation of having just sex and violence. But indeed, that's just what ""Lemnear"" has in its very short runtime (almost an hour). The plot vaguely consists of a chosen one set out to free her people, or some such nonsense. The film has no sense of character nor direction and mostly consists of animation that is subpar for the genre and useless plot devices that might be good in another movie. What the film does develop is sex and nudity. True, much anime has these two, but plenty still keeps a strong story going... There's better stuff out there."
3,Paper recipies,"The book is helpful but I found that the same recipes were duplicated but just with different colors. No tips on how to make paper, just recipies. Good book if you wnt information on how to make pulp from natural resources."
3,"Predictable, Yet Nice, Story","I liked this book, though it is no great literary work. The story is timelessly romantic, which is appealing. However, it's *very* predictable, and the author did not research how to Americanize her American character, Robin. Robin, supposedly American, often comes out with words or phrases like, ""advert"" for ""ad,"" ""piss off"" for ""screw you,"" etc., etc. That part's actually kind of funny, but it makes the book lose a bit of its flavor.The pain and human nature of the two main characters is described very well. They are real people, which I liked.The story wraps up quite quickly and a bit too neatly (everyone gets everything kind of story). Then, the author leaves the ending completely open, which disappointed me. There's no real closure to it.Worth a read, but don't get your expectations too high."
1,"Same old, Same old","What's the new, riveting, original gimmic of this book--the sequel to the original Batman Vs. Predator? Nothing. A predator comes to Earth because he wants to break the Bat. Actually, it's wrong to call this a ""grudge match."" After all, this predator never even fought Batman before. Anyhow, the predator beats up some other guys, then beats up Batman who is saved in the nick of time until he finally defeats the predator. Well, until another predator defeats the first predator. Borrrrringgg. If you're looking for a good Batman story, then read Dark Knight Returns or Arkham Asylum. This comic though just doesn't cut it."
4,A big improvement,"The first Bat vs Pred had a grim, dark art-design that, while atmospheric, wasn't particularly easy on the eye. The story was also far too straight-forward and went through all the usual motions of Predator crossovers. This sequel though, is MUCH better, featuring bright, colorful artwork, more interesting characters and a more complex plot that has three Preds stalking around Gotham City.The character of Huntress is also quite hot. For an animation she sure does have a nice ass and cleavage. It's a shame she and the Bat never got it on, but there's little time for that when a group of assassins and an alien are after you. The Pred obviously makes light work of the hired killers, saving the pleasure of killing Bats all for himself in a showdown more cinematic than the first time around.It's long out of print, so you'll have to pick it up used somewhere. The back cover lists a 4.99 rrp. I feel so OLD, were they EVER that cheap? Two lengthy forewords by the editors precede the story."
4,"Fine, entertaining superhero battle","Anything with the name Batman vs. Predator II: Bloodmatch is not about to win any literary awards. But for what it is, a fight between crime-fighters and vicious aliens, it's pretty darn good.Batman vs. Predator is a good match, Batman is a great martial artist, with clever devices and tricks but is solidly outmatched against a 7' tall alien warrior with plasma weapons who can also turn invisible.Writer Doug Moench fills in the basic concept with some good subplots. As the Predator hunts Batman, Batman must deal with the rogue heroine the Huntress and an all-star team of international assassins gunning for his head.Artist Paul Gulacy turns in a fine job with memorable villains, beautiful women and exciting action.This sort of crossover book has to be a throw-away, there will be no huge changes to continuity or character history but it's a good fun ride."
3,Innovative for its time,"Torso is the type of comic which takes known facts and converts them into a storyline. This specific plot focuses on the famous Eliot Ness detective and his downfall following his brilliant crime career. An unsolved mass murder case is the subject here.Bendis is cutting his teeth here, and there is innovative use of panels and placements to create avant-garde story-telling. Sometimes, this can get too much with panels causing one to rotate the page 360 degrees just to read the text. As this is a cheap production, the graphics are in black and white, interspersed with gritty photos from the actual cases.Bendis' trademark dialogues are here, numerous speech balloons pepper each page conveying non-stop conversations between the characters.Its really an OK read, not too bad but not that great either."
3,Bad Binding for Bendis,Beware of used books sold directly by Amazon. This book by Bendis fell apart as soon as I read the first 10 pages. It was badly bound. A total rip-off. For a few dollars more I could have bought it new. Very aggravating.
2,unexpected,"this book was not for readers, ages 9-12. It was more for readers, ages 5-6. This is why I returned it."
5,Classic duo,Both great movies if you like scary movies with humor and a good ending would highly recommend.
4,great combo,"Demon knight is a great horror film with verry good special effect ,great acting too.Bordello of blood had good special effect with also great actors like Chris Sarandon among others, great combo!"
1,wrist band falls off if pulled back,"Very comfortable watch. 5 stars for comfort, however No stars for the longevity. My wife used this watch for many months. I borrowed it once and had the following problems.1. Moisture entered and fogged the lens.2. The wrist band disconnected from the watch body. The wrist band cannot be re-installed.This would be an absolutely fantastic watch if they provided a better way to keep the wrist band from seperating from the watch, or provided a way to re-attach it if it did seperate, without taking the watch apart."
5,This a Classic for all April Wine lovers,"This is the original line up and April Wine turns out some great guitar work on Could have been a lady and Bad side of the Moon. Great lyrics, and well written ballads. The sound takes you back to the early seventies when life was much simpler and music was all that mattered. This is a must have."
1,marcosuzi,"This was the wrong size so it had to be returned. No problem with returning. Unfortunately, the person sending this had no idea what was being sent even tho the dimensions were given."
1,Not happy,"The ear loop doesn't stay hooked to the device very well, and comes off completely sometimes just taking it out of my jacket pocket. Also, very bad reception. I could not hear others and they could not hear me."
3,so small,"is a very beutifull fairy, but is soooo small you don't even see it...so sad, cause i really love it in the picture and when it arrive i was very sad to see it soo small, i used anyway, but i think is to much money for something that small!"
2,Activity Clock,"It is a nice concept, but doesn't work well in real life. Maybe the age needs to be increased. My 3 year old is more interested in playing with the cards. The spot for the cards doesn't hold them securely. I thought the clock would actually work, but it has no battery, so you just move the hands around. Very well built, but not too functional."
5,Credit Hell: How to Dig Out of Debt,Very informative and easy to follow. There are so many good pointers that I can use to improve my financial situation now and in the future.
3,Some Good Information,"This is not a bad credit / debt book. The only problem with it is that I wish the book went into more depth about credit hell. I would certainly not use this book as your only source of advice if you are in credit hell, and need advice, but I would use it as a source to start with. I would still reccomend this book."
2,Bitterly Disappointed,"I've been a space pen user for >30 years. The standard model's cap fits nicely over the back of the barrel thereby elongating the pen into a ""normal"" pen size. The trekker will not do that. So try writing with it. Unless you have a hand the size of a 5-year old it's like writing with a stub, very uncomfortable, pretty darn useless unless you're just jotting down a word or two, maybe a phone number. You just can't use it as a pen. Bummer."
3,Good as an introduction to schizophrenia,"This book isn't for people who want in-depth coverage of schizophrenia. It's very conversational, written as a series of interviews, and is meant to introduce people who've been diagnosed with schizophrenia or who have found out that someone they know is schizophrenic, and has no idea what it's all about. As an introdruction to the disease, how it affects people, the medications prescribed, etc., it does a pretty good job of being informative without being scientific, and avoids being dumbed down. But for people who already know about schizophrenia, the contents should be familiar."
5,Best Great Big Sea,"I got to know Great Big Sea while working in Geulph Ontario Canada and working with a girl from Newfoundland. This is a great album, with much richness in words and music. Traditional and yet modern in a good way. It reminds me of Canada and those times. You will enjoy it. It is simple and beautiful. Untouched by the ""states"" complexities."
3,Just a Silly DVD,"Wow! Where do I start.If you are looking for a video with a lot of nudity and sex scenes, this is not it. If you are looking for a silly anime cartoon with two girls fighting over the same, then this video is for you.I purchased this video thinking it to be a hardcore love story by seeing the video cover and the vague story line which came with it. After purchasing it, I found out that the movie is rated 16+.The stories about two girls, one (Chizuru) from the fox clan and the other (Nozomu) from the wolf clan. Both fall madly in love with a young boy named Kota. The girls try their hardest to get Kota to like them by constantly being by his side or making meals for him. Kota, who just wants to be friends with both girls, gets beating up trying to stop the fighting.I gave this movie a 3 rating because it was just too silly. The girls were cute but the action scenes were very weak."
4,Good intro,"I'm pretty ignorant concerning economics, so much of this went over my head, but I think it might be about the simplest and most introductory view of the Austrian view you're going to get."
1,Save your money my daughter is very disappointed,"My daughter just received this for her 5th birthday yesterday. She loves the movie and was very excited to open this (as I told her it was too expensive and Grandma got it for her). Anyway, we just went this morning to buy the required batteries. This does not interact with the movie as the commercial portrays. It comes with an audio CD that it barely if at all interacts with. The box must be within 6"" of the speaker and the cat with a certain distance from that. It did not work at all although we followed all the directions. The biggest disappointment was the false portrayal that the cat works with the movie (we watch this movie several times a day and the movie is excellent). The cat does talk and move when the paw is pushed and she is happy with that but for the money, this is a complete waste and will be returned. She can get the stuffed wolfie and sarafina cats for $8.00 that she will be just as happy with"
4,"cute,but not to sure it's worth the price you pay.","My little girl wanted this so bad for her 3rd birthday,but when we opened it,it would not work with the movie.After about a week her dad got the idea he was going to open the little box up and try to fix it.all it took was him mess with the connectors,they weren't touching the batteries and now it works,and our little girl loves it!"
1,Don't waste your money - Sheds ALL OVER THE PLACE,"This cat is just adorable, however, it sheds all over the place. If you have asthmatic child, really think about before purchasing. I can't imagine that all the while furs is healthy for anyone to breathe. I cannot believe they wouldn't consider this when making."
1,This toy sux.,"This sux. My lil sis got it 4 christmas and only two of her 'phrases' are actually in the ""serfina"" voice. The others aren't. She was like that when we took her outta da box. we tried new batteries and it diddnt work. don't by this 4 ur kid. (I tried to give it 0 starz but it wouldn't let me). I'm all for Barbie but this diddn't work and it sux. DON'T MAKE UR KID SUFFER! DON'T BUY IT! BUY THEM SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! did ne1 listen?"
5,"A funny, light read","I read the book while on a beach on Atlantic Island in North Carolina. It was an added bonus being able to relate to the various places mentioned in the book; Moorhead City, Cape Lookout and Beaufort. The author developed each character in a light and funny manner; to the point that you felt that you knew each of them. It gave me a great insight into the way of life for the locals of the Outerbanks. I strongly suggest this book and especially if you have been to the Outerbanks."
3,If you like trains,If you like trains I guess you will like this one. Surprisingly you need to pay attention. You can't just fire her up and walk away. At least not for long.
3,It is really a hard book to read,"We use the book as our biochemistry textbook. But it is very hard to read. I seldom can find satisfatory answer in this book, and sometimes even confused with the words. On the other hand, although the figure in the book is not enchanted, it is very clear. In summary, it may be a good book for someone who wants to review biochemistry, but not a good introductory book for students."
1,Couldn't get to the end................,"Horrible grafics! It seemed like the movie was cut and pasted from several other movies. Low budget, no name, saveyourself a bunch of time and choose another movie."
2,I did not really enjoy the Movie,The movie has an interesting title but found the story to slow to continue to enjoy and this is why I gave it such a low rating.
3,Back tory is sort of like old news,"Okay, I'm crazy about the Drag Race, but the back story, not so much, especially a couple years after the fact. I would probably enjoy this more and watch it if I could watch the main episode and then the untucked story right behind it. I didn't do it that way, and don't see where it's available for watching on the current season."
2,roasted garlic pasta,"Product did not ship well. pasta broken into small pieces. flavor profile was poor.I like the idea of low carb pasta, however."
3,Carba Nada pasta,"I was very excited about this pasta. I have been eating low carb for a while and this gave me the ability to have pasta... Ah,h,h,h.. love it. No one else has mentioned this so maybe it's the batch I got but they taste a little rancid.Anyone else had that issue? and yes,, they are better than those noodles in the liquid..-can't get past the fishy smell and taste of those"
2,Malibu lawn floodlights Gaskets,I received the Malibu pack of 4 lawn floodlights kit and found that all the gaskets had fallen behind the the bulb lens during shipment. I called Malibu and was told that this was not their product but a product made by Intermatic even though all the labeling and information on the box and instructions only had the name of Malibu. So I contacted Intermatic and was told that all of their products did not have a loose gasket but were sealed to fixture lens. So I purchased a tube of silicon adhesive and attached all the gaskets to the fixture glass lens. I still do not know if the product I bought is a Malibu or an Intermatic product. I really think that the product is a Malibu product but feel I should know in case of a warranty issue.I have read some reviews that indicated that water was found in the fixtures-I would recommend you check the gaskets and make sure that they are sealed to the glass lens of the fixture.
4,An Overview of Classical Magic,A good introduction to the contemporary study of magic in the classical world. That this book is a collection rather than written by a single author makes it more valuable as it provides a variety of interpritation in an area that is undergoing large scale renovations. Scholarly and a bit dry this book has nothing to do with the usual new age kook authors that make serious research into mystical studies a pain and then some.
5,ANOTHER PERFECT STRANGER,The dvd was superb and I enjoyed it immensely.Nothing is more compelling than the truth.
5,Another Perfect Stranger film,"This is the sequel to ""The Perfect Stranger"" and just as powerful as the original. I highly recommend it. It is a perfect witnessing tool."
3,Excellent customer service,"I initially wrote a feedback to the seller saying that the product was mediocre. After that, the seller reached out to me, offered me full refund and told me I could keep the product! I was pleasantly surprised. Despite the fact that I was not that impressed by the product, but their excellent customer service did impress me. I am not sure if I am going to buy their products in the future, but I do appreciate their efforts. This is what customer service supposed to be!"
3,"Good, but you could do better","I have had this LCD for about three years now, and the only complaint I have is that the response time and contrast ratio feel like they came out of the stone-age. It's difficult to play games or watch movies which have dark scenes in them, especially if there's no gamma/contrast adjuster built into the game.It is a great multi-input device, but for the price you're better off spending the money on a receiver to do all your inputs, and blow the rest on a 22"" LCD that has 1000:1 contrast and 8ms response."
1,NO stars---,"but, the format insists on at least one in order to use the review(?)---as we saw bugs floating in the boiling water and did not want to experience the taste!(Label only visible after opening box: 08/09 10 #41911-01)"
4,Variety,"Ray Solis Displays a wide variety and style of Music. Multi-range from Ballads, Tex-Mex,Cajun and Pop. I especially like #'s 8,10, 15 and 16. If you like Variety, ""Spectrum Magic"" is for you!!"
1,shocking - do not approach,"From their first album, the self titled American Hi Fi, i liked them. This album had catchy, guitar driven songs and was really what i had hoped for after hearing 'Flavour of the Weak'. Then came The Art Of Losing, this album was not as good as their first album but still contained some good tracks. This album however contains no good tracks, no catchy guitar driven songs and is a huge step backwards from their previous work. I will not be buying this album and i urge you to spend your money elsewhere(or on their old albums if you don't have them)as this was not only a waste of their time but also will be a waste of your money.I am hugely dissapointed with this album and unless there is a huge turnaround in their quality, i will never consider buying a new release by them again.If i could give this album 0 stars i would and i feel that i am being generous with 1 star."
1,Poorly built and noisy,"I've had this heater for two years now. It warms up the room well as you would expect, but is quite noisy when it is on.However, the biggest problem I have with it is its poorly built construction. The heating and fan mechanism is riveted onto the frame instead of screwed on. That may be good and well, but if it gets knocked over a few times, the rivets become loose. There's no way to fix them! Thus, the heating mechanism is dangling inside the case with no easy solution other than returning it for replacement in warranty. If it had been screwed in, it would simply be a matter of tightening or replacing the screws.This is especially disappointing because this is supposed to be a utility fan. One expects that a utility fan could be a little more durable than other types of fans. But when the rivets break after its knocked over, it becomes dangerous."
5,"great quality, safe heater","I found one of these heaters in a closet in my office at work from one of it's previous occupants and used it for a while. It easily heats my large office with no problem. The fan really makes this heater super efficient. It also has an instant shut-off if it tips over, adjustable fan speed and two heating levels. The chord gets a bit warm if it's run overnight on high, but I don't think that's much of an issue. One of these will easily heat our 15x20 living room on a chilly night. We now have 3 of these heaters at home, which is WAY cheaper than running central heat."
5,Dependable heater,"I've had two of these for many years. Solid, metal construction, not cheap plastic. Two heat levels, temperature adjustment, one speed fan, and shuts off if tipped over. It's not beautiful, but it is dependable. BTW, just found it for $19 at Walmart!"
1,No graphics or pictures!,"I bought this because of the images. This version doesn't have any pictures or graphics at all, so it's going back to amazon.com. Maybe they didn't want the expense of color inks, but how do they expect to sell any copies of this?"
2,Oh the humanity...,"As wretched as these two are, it's worth owning Miri just to witness a 27 year-old Michael J.Pollard passing as a 14 year-old and hearing Shatner emote ""NO BLAH-BLAH-BLAH!"""
5,attractive book,"I have personally attracted this book 4 times now and along with reading it ,and gifting it,I have also simply recommended it. easy to use. Works great, if you work it."
5,extra,j aimerais commander 4 autres exemplaires; la dernière commande aurait d tre de 5 mais un seul volume a été livré.... pouvez-vous reposter 4 livres supplémentaires dans le panier de Jean-Guy Dubois et ne charger qu un frais de livraison...apprécierais avoir confirmation par tel: 1-888-370-9889 (Suzanne)
4,reflections on a book I grew up with,"Playing with Sophie the Siamese with our daughter and new son-in-law, sharing observations about cats' idiosyncracies and universalities, I suddenly remembered one of my favorite books from childhood, Cats by Wilfred Bronson. It appeared when I was 6 or 7, and I think its detailed and affectionate observations and illustrations about cat-kind, coupled with my observations of Fluff the Manx, formed the basis of my life-long affinity for the feline. Detailed black-and-white drawings, perhaps charcoal or lithographs, are liberally interspersed with the text, accurately illustrating the ways cats' moods and needs are expressed by posture, sounds, ear position, pupil size, and like details. This would be the ideal book for a child or adult beginning a caring or custodial relationship with a cat. I was delighted to check Amazon and find that it still exists, and will be obtaining a copy for myself, and perhaps to bestow on a niece, nephew, or grandchild."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"The Powell Brandon Swivel Arm chair was exactly what I wanted. The wood matched my desk perfectly and the fabric blended well with my furniture. I liked it so much that I disposed of the box after the first week. The problem was the shabby quality of the chair itself........After two weeks the fabric that was stapled in the back of the chair came loose exposing the foam. There was little or no softness in the seat cushion. It felt like an old chair that had been sat in for years. The wood on the arms of the chair was rough in places like it was missing the finishing product that would make it smooth.I was very disappointed in the over-all quality of the product and contacted Amazon about returning it. Amazon, as always, was very helpful and took care of the problem for me. Now I'm back to trying to find a replacement."
2,Not to bright,"It is a light weight toy. Plastic, I can't imagine this will hold up long term, but I am thinking I will get a few years use out of it."
3,"Great, With Caveats","Pros: It works, and is relatively affordable.Cons: Not as bombproof as I had hoped.If the D-cell batteries should happen to leak in the course of storage, you'll have a stubby plastic club.In my situation, the leak damaged the extra lenses at the base of the flashlight, rendering them useless. Also affected was the switch; the contacts had corroded as a result.A vinegar/water solution worked well to fix the switch problem. Simply disassemble the flashlight such that all you have left is the body, and let sit in a sinkful of the solution. Use undiluted vinegar to remove any deposits from the casing.I would recommend a drop-in LED replacement for the standard bulb. It will burn longer, while at the same time, consume less battery power."
1,severely unsatisfied,"so i bought this flashlight because i wanted a military style anglehead flashlight, and i had a good reason to get it, Halloween. So i received it, and the switch was already broken. I kind of have it working sometimes, with the help of a screwdriver, but its still broken, and ridiculous to carry around. If the switch was working, i would say it is a pretty good flashlight for the money, but if this is how i receive the package, i would say, do not buy..."
4,Good safe for kids,"I bought this safe for my grandson so he can securely stash his allowance money and cash Grandpa and Grandma give him. He loves it. I only wish they made this where you can enter your own combo. Our 7 year old grandson may have difficulty memorizing the combo that came with this safe. I also wish you can choose the color because he wanted black, but it came in blue. The color blue is okay with my grandson, so no big deal. I recommend this product."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"I bought this for a friend's son and it seemed like it would be perfect. It had a lock to keep his brother out and he was so excited to have this bank. Unfortunately, you can open the lock w/out the combination due to the flimsy nature of this product. I wasn't even going to give this as a gift after I realized how terrible the durability was. It was last minute though so I did, as I had nothing else. Very disappointed."
2,Save Your Money,"Mine just arrived. It's okay but not worth the money. I love percussion instruments of all types. But this won't be in my top 10. It's not one continuous piece of wood, and not something my professional musician friends would use. But it's distinctive, would look good hanging up, and will stand up to occasional use."
1,Who actually enjoys this junk?,"Here is a suggestion to you Nik Angello. Quit rapping immediately, or trying to rap... which is as close as you can get. I can actually respect that he put his name on this album because it obviously took a lot of guts. I dont think that i have ever heard anything that is this terrible. Then again, if you like terribly produced rap, that has an MC with a nasally voice this might be for you. This guy couldnt come up with a solid flow if his life depended on it. Anybody can do better than this. I feel sorry for his parents who were obviously the ones who put up the money to make this album because they lost money, and their son looks like a fool."
3,Great Promotional Book,"I was impressed with the photos, but it was never explained how Mr. Marcus can shoot both a traditional and photojournalistic wedding with two camera systems at the same time. There was one brief mention that he saw a candid moment happening over there, switched from a Hasselblad to the Canon, quickly got his B&W decisive moment without a hitch, then goes back to shooting traditional color wedding photography. Absolutely amazing! As an experienced wedding photographer, I would like to know how this works...all day. If he can hedge between the two styles and pull it off, how can the reader do the same, or even want to do the same?"
5,Great Panorma of the Jesus Search,"I've read several books on the search for the historical Jesus, including those by Albert Schweitzer, David Strauss, Renan and A.N. Wilson. But Charlotte Allen;s book, ""The Human Christ,"" is the most deeply researched, lucidly told and even-handed sweep of mankind's quest for the ""real"" Jesus. Allen is especially vivd about the Palestine & Rman culture of Jesus's era and she'd crafty about presenting the idea and a brief background of all the Jesus theorists since the Middle Ages----up to and including the Jesus Seminar of the 1990's and computered form search of the New Testament writers. My surprise is that this highly readable, fearless book has received so little attention by mainstream reviewers. (I wonder if that's because Mrs. Allen is a highly talented, knowledgeab;e free-lancer instead of an academic with a string of college acronyms by her name.)"
1,Atrocious and misleading,"This book is misleadingly titled. It does *not* contain DirectX 8.0. It has nothing to do with 3D graphics, which is an essential concept in games programming. The content is very simple and contains concepts that were taught in 16-bit SVGA DOS games, taught in approximately the same way. The content of the book not at all relevant to the title of the book.I'm very glad that I found out about this before I bought it. I spent a good half hour looking through it at the bookshop, because I wanted the SDK CD anyway. The author ought to be ashamed."
1,"8 years behind the times, completely useless.","Nothing is more useless than an out of date computer book.There is not one useful bit of information in this book. I would be embarrased to have my name on something this dated in the year 2002.There are plenty of decent introductory computer programming books. Try OpenGL game programming - or any book with the name 'LaMothe' on it.As a general rule of thumb, computer science professors from anywhere besides the best schools seem to be 4 - 10 years behind industry. This is why you shoule never ever buy a programming book by anyone whose title contains the letters PH.d."
2,Not really about DirectX 8,"DirectX 8 herald a new era of the API. It was a complete re-write. DirectDraw and Direct3D were combined into a easier and more powerful API called DirectX Graphics. This release also means that you'll be able to take your programming beyond the PC, to the Dreamcast and the X Box.Unfortunately this book doesn't take advantage of the new API at all. Basically it's just a rehash of the author's previous work Learn Computer Game Programming with DirectX 7.0. Apart from having a few less chapters this book touches on nothing in the significant upgrade. It would of been better if they called this book ""Re-released book about DirectDraw 7 with just a few chapters missing"".If you want a real book on DirectX 8 Graphics get ""Beginning Direct3D Game Programming"" by Wolfgang F. Engel."
5,"Quickest, simplest, and cheapest Bible reference tool-a MUST","The best topical reference book available on the market, and the best priced too. Want to know what God thinks about a subject? Simply look it up. This reference tool is also very specific to breakdown the subject, so it will provoke new thoughts regarding the subject matter. It provides all the scripture references and definitions. Although this book is small, it is completely thorough. Due to it's size, it's very lightweight, especially in comparison to other type reference books. This is a great gift for anyone wanting to understand the Bible and God."
3,"Ok, for the price","Pole is a little flimesy, but doe's the job for the price. My boat dealer had a similar one for $75.00-this works just as well."
4,"Works as expected, recommended, but some goofiness","I've owned this one for several months, and overall I like it. It's the cheapest HP laserjet that provides duplex (double-sided) printing. No surprises, it's what you expect from an HP. Much faster than my old 5L. Can't tell how well built it is. It sounds ""plasticky"" when printing, but that's probably no big deal.Several negatives: 1) kind of bulky, 2) somewhat noisier than my old 5L 3) if duplex is on, sends printouts of less than one page through twice, which slows down a quick printout. Not a huge deal, but still seems like a dumb design flaw."
1,Baaaaaaaaaad,I buy this cassette ... but doesn't work... is bad.... :( i'm so sad because i want to play... bad bad bad! jum
5,A lyrical and redemptive vision of the acoholic journey...,"This taut book is finely written by a poet and novelist putting his life on the line in each sentence as a quest for vision and redemption. This is a remarkable autobiography in the American on the road grain. Saludos from Honolulu, Santa Cruz, and Moscow, Michael!"
1,Terrible Image,"I just returned the camera after 2 weeks of trying to get the settings to make the picture quality better. In daylight the quality is OK at best, but under low light conditions it was terrible. I'm really down on Casio after this experience, but the reviews on the other models give me some hope. I am looking at the Pentax model now.The size and options are great on this, but that did not compensate for the dismal picture quality."
2,Whimsy,"This is a good book for those it was written for, the admirers of the whimsical. I am not, I prefer picaresque. If you don't know the difference don't buy."
2,Fairfield Porter is over-rated,"The format, color plates and essay about Porter's life are all well done. However, it seems to me that despite his excellent reputation, Porter at best is a mediocre painter who draws awkardly. If you already like him, buy the book. But if you are looking for good representational art, look elsewhere."
1,Merchandise not as advertised,"I ordered a cookie sheet with a bonus cooling rack. Only the cookie sheet was received. When I contacted the company Zaccardi's , they blamed AMAZON saying that it was not supposed to come with a bonus cooling rack. It wanted to return the sheet and I requested many times from both AMAZON and Zaccardi's that they give me a prepaid shipping label and received no assistance from either. I did receive a credit for the item. Zaccardi's finally said that they would reimburse me for the shipping. It was mailed two weeks ago and I am still waiting for the credit of the shipping costs. I will never buy from either company again. By the way you are still advertising it incorrectly."
2,"Controls are awful, gameplay is too hard","I got this for my collection of NES & SNES games, but this is awful! The graphics are terrible (yes, I know this is 1980 NES game), Simon has no face. The first few stages were fun, until I got to the first boss: An ugly bat who was impossible to attack with your whip. After a week of practice, I defeated it and moved on to part #2. This is where the bad controls start to ruin it. Every time an enemy hit me, Simon would bounce backwards to his doom. I gave up after that."
4,"This is not Simple Simon who eats pies, this is Simon the Knight!!","This game is very hard, but very fun at the same time! In Castlevania, you get unlimited continues, not suprised.Now for the scores...Sound 9/10 Very good sound effects for a NES console!Music 11/10 Awesome music!! The music on level (not stage) 3 is my favorite.Gameplay 8/10 Very good gameplay!Difficulty 7/10 This game is a little too hard!! Some of the enemies can be very frustrating. Like the Hunchback for instance.You can't get passwords, what a shame...Overall: 9.7/10"
1,Important information lacking!,"While perhaps the title of this book might give you a hint, nothing in the documentation for this book tells you that it is NOT the original, but is a translation into Spanish. Be forewarned. My low-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the book. I assume the other reviewers were able to read the book in Spanish. But if you aren't able to do this, don't buy this book."
5,Trauma reference,This book is one of the few trauma analysis books that is perfect for archaeological and anthropological subjects. I used it while writing my Master's Thesis and it became one of my more frequently used references.
1,"Horrible, Don't Waste your Money","This Munchkin Product is horrendous, once put together the product was very wobbly/unsteady and when you roll the wheels keep falling up. I got the regular non deluxe cart same crap problems. Don't waste your money. Get a hand held Diaper Caddy."
3,"Great organization piece that could be toted around the house, but flimsy","I loved the look of this in the picture but when I received it, I discovered the cloth material it is made of is very flimsy. It doesn't hold weight well so you can only use it for light blankets and such. But it was nice to keep in our living room since we had a changing station there along with one in the baby room. This made it easy to grab clothes, diapers, and blankets without having to run across the house.If you're building a baby registry and would like some guidance on top rated baby stuff, check out AllMomsArePerfect.com. It'll tell you what you need and what you don't based on a ton of research."
2,There are no illustrations,"There are almost no illustrations of the movements described in this book. There is some good information but I think they are assuming you are already an experienced coach and have seen all these complex movements they talk about. if you are a novice looking for some detailed descriptions of the training movements, along with pictures, this is not the book for you."
3,"This time it's not who is possessed, it's how many!","The Exorcist 3 (Legion) is a good horror film, although it's very slow in places. The scariest bit for me was the headless statue of Jesus jumping out at a girl. That was freaky.I recommend it to fans of the original. George C Scott does a good performance as Lt. Kinderman"
2,It ain't The Exorcist I know and love,"I will never understand why people insist on making sequels. They are NEVER as good as the first one, and they are usually complete bombs. Well, The Exorcist was disgraced with two sequels; unfortunately neither of them were good. The second Exorcist wasn't as bas as this one, but still. Obviously, the only reason sequels for The Exorcist were made were for money purposes. A sequel to The Exorcist is pointless; the story has been told, now leave it alone. I say the same for the 2000 version of The Exorcist. They (William Peter Blatty & William Friedkin) should have left the film alone - it was perfect! The added scenes ruined the pace and didn't fit in at all. I give The Exorcist 3 two stars: one for having the word Exorcist in the title, and two because William Peter Blatty was involved with it."
2,"Not bad, but not good",This film really has absoultly nothing to do with the first 2. But this film does have a few good scenes.
2,catholic propaganda,Another brilliant film with an all star cast produced to convince the public that a young girl going through puberty is in violation of church doctrine. Countering societies rebellion against the superstitions of Christian Catholic religious dogma Gorge C. Scott plays detective determined to uncover the deceptions of the devil to show Jesus Christ is god's son and is the only salvation in an evil world.
