3,Do people in England really speak this way to each other?,"Since I am not familiar with the disorder, I do wonder if this is an accurate assessment of the way they think, and if the author could really know this for sure unless he was more than just a youth who worked with autistic children. Perhaps he studied it and didn't mention that fact.This book was given to me by a friend whose son, whom I've not met, has Asperger's.In any event, I was AMAZED at the rudeness in which the English people speak to one another in this book, if it is accurate, using the ""F"" word without hesitatation even to a child. Foul language was used regularly and never commented on as being an issue. Why?"
1,i know..i know,"i know that having a 4.5 stars from 1033 customers will make my review outcasted..but honestly...i found nothing ""wow"" about this book...the writer has been around autistic kids and knows how they act and react...so he just describes that...From the book, you can learn about what is like being ""autistic""..so..if i am interested in that..i will go and buy a scientific book.."
4,Well-written and touching portrayal,"Set as a mystery, Haddon's story is sometimes funny and subtly heart-wrenching. I read this book in one sitting, and would recommend it to anyone."
4,The curious incident of the dog in the night-time,"I thought it was an excellent read, it was quite humorus at times and certianly got you grippping the edge of your seat at certian moments. Passers by made alot of derogatry remarks about Christopher but it was encouraging that he took no notice, this is maybe a good lesson for those being bullied. It gives you a look at how logical someone could be."
3,The World According to Rain Man,"Narration by a 15 year-old high-functioning autistic boy anchors this book. The author captures the cadence and observations that we would imagine from such a narrator. It is funny and clever. Hemingway would be proud of his simple declarative sentences. But the plot revolves around the mystery of who killed the neighbor's dog. That thin gruel drags between the boy's observations on dinosaurs, space, God, and other things. The tangents are akin to Family Guy -- they have nothing to do with the plot and comprise the bulk of the novel. I like a good plot and I found the long asides a bore most of the time. It is a quick and easy read. Just don't buy it if you want a good story rather than the world according to Rain Man."
4,Seeing things from a different point of view,"The narrator is a mentally challenged kid, no he is not stupid, he just can't understand human emotions. He could do math, understand science, physics, the Big Bang, the Black hole, everything else except feelings. There are lot of symbolism in the book. It makes you wonder is it better to live in his world or the emotional one. Perhaps, he IS the computer. I want to give it 4.5 stars."
3,Good character,But some parts were too detailed and scientific (ie boring) but the actual story was entertaining if you skip all the math problems.
1,"Published Reference Works, Similies,Wee and Poo Ad Infinitum","How can so many reviewers be so wrong in praising this orginal work created by Mark Haddon, a creative writing teacher living in Oxford, England with his family? He cleverly compartmentalizes this tale of autistic grief and joy with prime numbers from 2 to 233, food, parents, teachers, neighbors, strangers, policemen, pets, classmates, colors, sights, sounds, smells, puzzles, quizes, tests, games, maps, and perspective drawings supposedly from the perspective of a young teenage boy who writes a murder mystery story about his dog, Wellington. This work is overloaded with disgusting invective. I should not have endorsed those positive reviews by other reviewers by recommending it to other readers."
5,The book arrived super fast!!!,I ordered this book for my son's required summer reading. It arrived super fast and in great brand newshape. I haven't read the book myself so I can not comment on the story.
3,"Eh. You think it's going to be good, but it goes downhill.","Well, I'll save you some time, this is not a mystery. The perpetrator is revealed early on. I thought it would be a quirky mystery, with the protagonist being different than your average protagonist. This book quickly evolves into something different. It is more along the lines of coming of age, a boring one. The book is not bad, the writing is decent. The story line is just boring. Like I said, the book is not necessarily bad, but there are millions of other books in the world, pick one of them instead."
4,OK Service,"This book took a little over a week to arrive, which is more time than most books take to arrive."
4,Understanding Kaczynski,"Mark Haddon combines keen observation of the autistic mind with empathy for the reader to bridge the abyss between the average Joe and his autistic neighbor. This book grabs the imagination long enough to explain autism to the disgusted and unsympathetic. Parents and caregivers of autistics will enjoy the surprisingly funny, bittersweet story before lending it out to their relatives and friends. Policymakers and citizens who want to steer autistic kids toward a useful life and away from writing Unabomber Manifestos and blowing people up should check out this book for its insights. Genuine autistic writings usually irritate without reaching their readers. Haddon has managed the autistic protaganist in first person without being untrue to his subject or unkind to his audience."
2,Not the greatest,"I have read this book, however i do not believe that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the NIght-TIme was good at all. :("
5,A Must Read,"This is the first review I have ever offerred for any medium. I just finished this book and cannot stop recomending it. As the parent of a 7 year old autistic girl I have often wondered ""what is going on in that head of hers?"". I don't pretend to have all the answers because of this book, but Mr. Haddon's ability to let us take a peek is truely astonishing. I found this book to be a quick read that was funny, heartbreaking, and wonderful. I know I will be more tolerant of my daughter's quirks and habits as a result of this book...quite an effect for a piece of writing to have. If you or anyone you know is effected by autism this is a MUST READ."
4,Short but surprisingly moving,"This novel is unlike any I have read before. It is told in first person from the point of view of an autistic teen. He lives in a town in England and confines himself to a strict routine. Until one night he finds a dog that has just been killed. He loves reading Shirlock Holmes and decides to write a murder mystery novel about ""the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.""The novel is meant to be written by Christopher (our main character) as he searches for clues to the mystery. He loves prime numbers so the chapters are each assigned one. About half of the chapters are descriptions of his surroundings or past memories that don't move the plot forward and sometimes happen right in the thick of things but are very interesting. Short novel, but surprisingly moving."
5,Very different novel.,"This is Mark Haddon's first novel and it turned out to be an excellent one. It is a wonderful story written as a first-person account by an autistic young man, Christopher. I don't want to give away the story but, it reads like a blog. It has a lot of interesting facts, illustrations and puzzles. It is a fun read. Very different."
5,One of my favorite novels.,"I read a chapter or two, then minutes later, picked it up again. My heart goes out to the Christophers of this world. Some people will always be misunderstood. Great story, I bought one for my sister for Christmas."
5,pleasant surprise,"i wasn't expecting much but it turned out to be brilliant! can writing be ""friendly""? reading Haddon you'll find the answer yourself."
4,Neato,"I'd totally recommend this book. It may not be the most extraordinary story ever written, but it's pretty darn good. It's so different from anything that I've ever read. At first the style seems a but strange, but the you get into it. Before I read this, I didn't really know that much about how an autistic person could bahve. After reading it I have a little glimpse into what their lives are like. It's informative without being all boring.Basically, the story revolves around a boy trying to solve a neighborhood mystery. In the process of ""detective"" work he uncovers things you never would have expected. You see the effect an autistic child can have on family.Certain things in this book seem unecessary, but it gets good again before you have time to get bored. You'll read through this book in no time."
5,LOVED this book!!,"Although a couple events in the book were predictable, I enjoyed this book more thoroughly than just about any book I've ever read. I was fascinated by the accurate description of a young boy trying to work things out without ""normal"" references the rest of us use. That we were so consistently introduced into his world, with flashes of how things appeared to others was brilliant. so many books attempt to achieve this sort of perspective and fail -this one was a home-run. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking something truly unique, thought-provoking, and enjoyable."
5,one of my faviorite books,"Not only is this book very hard to put down, but if you read it, it will help you in your own life.Each time Christopher had to face something new and difficult, he would take the time to find a way to accomplish his goal. Now, in my own life, when I feel overwhelmed by a situation, I stop and think - what would Christopher have done to solve this. This book is definitely worth reading!"
4,A Great Read,"This book is full of humor, sadness and mystery. The more I read, the more I enjoyed and appreciated it. It's an easy book to read (except for the occasional quadratic equation), and I haven't laughed out loud that much in a long time. Highly recommended."
3,"Ok book, the main character is very irritating...","I picked up the book after reading so many reviews here at Amazon from avid readers who just rave about the book. What a surprise. I find the lack of ANY emotion from the main character irritating, i felt so sorry for everyone around him, from his mother to his father, but not for Christopher. Overall an ok book, i liked the puzzles and the mathematical riddles, is it one of the best books i have ever read? Far from it."
5,Terrific Read!,"""This book was so terrific that, when I read a passage of it to my teenage son, he said, ""I want to read that when you get finished."" Well, I finished quickly (it's short) and gave it to him. He read it!Why is that so amazing? Well, my son reads about one book every 2 years. He loved it.I have a friend who has an autistic son. While reading this, I could imagine that, yes, my friend's son seems to quite possibly think this way.It's amazing how Mark Haddon was able to tell this story from the viewpoint of someone that is autistic. Autistic people cannot truly communicate how they think and feel to us. but Mr. Haddon seems to have hit it on the head.You don't really read this book for the story, which is interesting, but not terrific, you read it for the WRITING."""
5,Autistic 15yo masquerades as Sherlock Holmes,"When autistic 15-year-old Christopher Boone is wrongly accused of killing a frikkin' poodle, he decides to employ techniques of Sherlock Holmes' to track down the killer himself. In the process, difficult for anyone, but imagine trying to do it when you're autistic, he finds it necessary to navigate the emotional complexities of a social world that requires what must feel to him like swimming in molasses. From this improbable and potentially confusing premise comes a completely original work in a unique and compelling literary voice.Watch for this Mark Haddon guy; he's going places."
4,a unique read,I really enjoyed how different this book was from anything else I have read. There were times when I would finish a chapter and then stare out the window contemplating it all. I loved that. It is also an enriching experience to view the world through the perspective of someone like Christopher - an autistic savant. Great read. Only wish it was actually written by him as the book implies. How cool would that be?
3,Where'd the mystery go?,"This book begins as an unconventional story about an autistic teenager determined to solve a murder mystery in spite of his social disability. It's charming. Christopher has a unique and believable voice and a refreshingly simple take on the world. I wish it stayed that way. But it doesn't. Halfway through, the mystery goes `poof' and the book becomes about divorce, deceit, troubled relationships and all the standard moaning of modern dysfunctional fiction. A disappointing detour from a promising whodunit and detective."
5,Best Book Ever!,Very well written. Full of action and suspence. I couldn't put it down! All in all a great book! 5 stars *****
2,An interesting way to write a book,"The book is written from the eyes of an autistic child. I find it an innovative point of view, but it gets old quickly since he blabbers on about insignificant details. I understand this is probably how a real autistic person thinks, but maybe he could have skipped a lot of the rambling details and gave it mre of a story line."
2,It was OK,"I found this book to be odd and not very interesting. It is written in the first person as a 15 year old boy with autism. This was believeable. As a person with very little time to read, I would not have choosen this book (it was chosen as the first book for a new book club). It was a fairly quick read."
3,Incredibly insightful,"This book was recommended to me. I bought it and it sat on the shelf for a year before I picked it up and started to read it. I just wasn't sure I could get into it. It is a fairly short book,so I finished it quickly. It was entertaining and heartwarming and educational. Written from a unique perspective."
3,"Good, but frustrating","I thought this book was good, but found it very frustrating to read. The author wrote it as if it were written by an autistic boy. Therefore, the topics jumped around so much and didn't keep on track. I kept getting irritating, thinking, ""Just stick to the subject!"" However, I guess that is exactly what he was intending."
3,Advanced Simplicity,"Probably my favorite part of this book was the point of view it was told in. I've never quite seen anything like it and this was partially what kept me interested until the end. This is definitely a character driven novel and through Haddon's spectacular situations and simplistic yet advanced vocabulary he manages to portray to the reader a very unique boy by the name of Christopher Boone. However, I did find myself enjoying the beginning more than the end. As the book neared its finish line, it somehow seemed to lag and the plot seemed a bit petty. Overall, I did enjoy this read and would reccommend it to others for the most excellent writing strategies and devices used."
5,Asbergers,This book should be compulsory reading for psychiatry trainees and teachers who deal with special interest pupils. It is beautifully and sympathetically written about a lad with Asbergers.
2,Not a favorite.,"When I finished this book I couldn't help wondering why it was rated so highly. It was okay, but I wouldn't pass it on to my friends."
4,Fun to live inside someone else's head for a while,"This book was interesting in how the mystery was spun out by living in another persons head for a while. I would like to have a classroom set of this book because it would be educational as far as being intrigued and appreciative of the different kinds of thinking, The math in the book was fun to see how it was used to calmed the main character Christopher. It was fun to see how confusing facial expressions could be to Christopher also.It's fun when a book takes you to a different time or place, but this time it took me to a different brain and it was a nice journey."
5,Wow. What a game.,"This is the best X-Men, and for that matter best comic book based game I've ever played. It seems to be a hybrid of an action game and an RPG.You have just about every X-Man or Brotherhood mutant available. They all have cool powers and abilities. It's neat to try different team configurations. I'm and X-Men geek if you can't tell.The sound, story line, and graphics are great. It's great to have Patrick Stewart as the voice of Xavier, but I wish they could have had other voices from the movies as well. The voices are still great.It has taken me a while to get used to all of the controls and options, but I like that in a game. It makes me feel more involved.This game is a must have."
3,Hardcopy of on-line docs,"There's very little in the way of new information in this book; it's essentially a hard-copy of the on-line reference manual. Some people will find that valuable, but others won't. Buyer beware."
2,Have you got the online docs ? (err.. yes),"I don't like slating books so I am not about to start.PostgreSQL Essential Reference is not bad. If it actually contained more details, fuller explanations, more or better examples than the docs that come free with postgres then it would be well worth having. As such, IMHO it actually offers less for the most part.I am really trying to find a place for this on someone's book shelf. If you are a beginner and don't have access to the online docs then you might find something here. If not I would heartily recommend Bruce Momjian's online (or printed) work as a companion to the original potgreSQL manual"
4,For everyday's PostgreSQL users,"The book has done its job pretty well. It's for everyday's life of PostgreSQL users, and especially me that's just started to work on this DB. It covers almost everything about this exceptional open-source database. You'll never need another book. However, one thing I think I need more from it is ""database performance tuning"" issue. It touches on some of that stuff, but in the real world, if you're running a more or less stressful db, then this issue is critical."
5,More Wisdom than One Man Can Glean,"I can hardly believe all of this wisdom came from one man. It would take me a hundred years to learn all that is contained in this book from any other source. Before this book I thought my own writing skills served me well enough, now I see clearly how much I didn't know. I'm sure to refer to this book over and over, it is a must have for any writer's library."
5,usmcordie,"Wow! Out of the box, set up in about an hour. Runs smoothly, quietly and cuts great. I am most happy that I spent the extra bucks on a quality piece of machinery."
2,A less than average BATMAN game......but not the worst either.........,This is the Sega Genesis version of the same game that was released on the 8-Bit Nintendo!!! The Nintendo version is the one to get! You would think that the developers/programmers would have at least used some of Sega's 16-Bit power to made the game better in at least one aspect??? Making the graphics bigger is not that important. The controls are very sluggish and the difficulty is steap making for a frustrating combo. The pros of the game are few and far between. If you are an avid collector of Batman videogames then go ahead. It's not the worst game ever made for the Genesis console but it's barely passable fun.
3,Does what it's supposed to,"This product does not have as many features as some of its competitors, but it does what it says it will do."
1,Worthless,"Despite the word ""laser"" being used in a rather deceptive manner in this product's name, it uses ultrasound technology, not laser, to determine the measurements; the laser is just there to... er... what is it there for? Aiming the ""sonic beam""? Yeah, right. It's there to justify the use of the word ""laser"" in the product name, and that's about it.The joke is that you don't have to spend that much more to get a real laser tape measure that works well, like theCST/Stanley 77-910 TLM100 FatMax Tru-Laser 1/4-Inch at 100 Feet Laser Measurer.Don't waste your money on this useless product."
1,inconsistant,"i understand that these things are only estimators and cannot replace a tape.but this thing must be kept perfectly still and straight or readings are off 3 feet!also readings are never cosistant or my hand is not steady enough.i dont know what byou could use this thing for.it is totally inaccurate,unless i got a bad one.however i will not send it back because i dont have time to hassle with this.i already wasted an hour or so trying to learn how to use it.also i found key pad very confusing and complicated."
3,Missing parts...open carton!,"The carton arrived looking like it had been opened and resealed...always makes me nervous. Sure enough, the leg levelers were missing. Good thing I have a level shop floor. Bought this for a miter saw and it fits fine and is sturdy enough. The MDF top is a bit flimsy and has the same dimensions of the top frame,so I opted to make my own out of a larger piece of better quality MDF. All in all, it's a good sturdy stand...but could stand a few tweaks."
3,"Bag it, tag it, sell it to the butcher in the store","I have to say, I was very unimpressed with this album. I'm not a Phish-head by any means, but I do have all their albums and enjoy their music very much. I was kind of taken aback by this one. Having no idea what it was, I got it this past Xmas. I decided to listen to it on my long drive home from my parents' place. I guess I should have left earlier, as this disc did not keep me awake. Fortunately I had Picture of Nectar on me and was able to make it home in one piece. I will say that this music is... interesting. I don't regret owning it, and do listen to it on occasion. BUT, if you're looking for familiar Phish music, try another album."
3,Don't Listen to The Other Reviewers.....,"The reviewers above who gave this album 2 stars obviously don't know the real Phish (as opposed to the side of Phish you hear on most of their studio albums). These songs are not supposed to have focus; I mean they're not really songs, it's just cool, subtle IMPROV. This is a good CD, worth buying if you're willing to give it a chance and listen to the groove instead of looking for a catchy hook. This is not a definitive or exemplary album but it is something different and definitely worth giving a listen."
1,If You Like Phish Read This,"This album was a joke. The only reason to buy it is to support the band. I am a fan of the band, as a matter of fact I'd probably say they are my favorite band, but this album was not the phish i have grown to love. Some say it is Phish in their element, jamming. However, these tracks do not fit the description of jams or grooves, but flow more along the lines of an alien trying to play a nose flute through a Mcdondald's drive through reciever. Another thing is the shortness of the tracks. The one or two songs that really start to jam end up being no mroe than 6 or 7 minutes. I am not the guy who wants a catchy tune and that's why I don't like this. I like jams, long and intricate, but this CD does a discredit to Phish's name."
2,"Unfortunately, Not Your Typical Rough Guide","I usually prefer Rough Guides over the more ""touristy"" Frommers and Fodors, but this particular guide to Seattle loses out to the others in a big way. Writers of Rough Guides used to be opinionated, almost passionate about their place of choice, and that voice is missing in Rough Guide Seattle. Bland reviews, no high or low marks (surely, not everything in King Co. is perfect?)and a decided bias against ""left leaning"" (duh, it's the Pacific Northwest, dude) stores, music, what have you, left me wanting more. I got more from the Chamber of Commerce brochure. The writer(s) sounded bored and duty-bound to crank out some sort of milquetoast guide. Where's Gordon McLachlan, the god who wrote the original Real Guide to Germany with so much verve and wit?"
5,Can't get enough,"This is the fourth time I've read this book, but the first it was so light! The kindle makes reading such a wonderful, but hard to tote book, easy as a house elf disapperates. ;)"
5,Amazing!!,This book is one that will definitely pull you in...you can't put it down!! I recommend this series to everyone!
3,Ghost writer,This book reads differently from the other Harry Potter books. Does anyone out there think that someone else wrote it? It just does not read like the other Harry Potter books. Perhaps I am crazy but I think someone else wrote this book. What do you think?
3,dumbledorf not dead,"First there is no way for Harry POtter to go on without the head masterSecond Dumbledore gave the key clue when he told Malfoy he could make it appear his whole family was dsead to avoid Voldemort.Snape would not let anyone else, including Malfoy kill Dumbledorf and he would allow no one including himself to kill HarrySnape will return a hero in Book Seven"
5,Best Book I have read im my entire Life!,"Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince was absolutely amazing. I literally could not put the book down, it was emotional, heartwarming, suspensful and thrill seeking. I am speechless, all I can say is that this is the best book i have ever read. Your money will be spent wisely with this purchase. Enjoy!!!"
5,"Great suspense, that sets the stage for the 7th book!","This book grabs you with suspense and mystery from the first few chapters. You get a lot of background on Voldemort and two surprises at the end that really leave you to wonder just what will become of our favorite characters in the next novel? I will say she could've done more with Draco's character in this one, but all in all it was an excellent read!!!!"
4,Danni's Review,"J. K. did it again! This will change the way you look at the series. Voldemort is alive and in the wizarding world. The Death Eaters evil deeds are spreading and threatening the muggle world. Dementors are everywhere stealing hope, light and happiness. The questions about about Harry and whether he is the 'chosen one' and Hermione and Ron have their own challenges with deciding what course to take for the N.E.W.Ts. This is great reading! Now on to book 7. Yeah!"
2,It didn't match up,"Compared to the other HP books, this one doesn't match up. It's too long and nothing interesting really happens. Rowling makes it a page turner by having the reader expect something interesting to happen, but nothing does. There is no central story line as in the previous books. It all just flows with suspense that isn't satisfying at the end. The important information that we are given could easily be summarized in the final book, and then end the whole series... enough with dragging out the same storyline and get rin of Voldemort already!Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the library if you really must read it."
2,Missed the mark,"What a dissapointment! Half Blood Prince did not really get rolling until half the book. It seems that J.K. Rowling was spending too much time giving us background on charaters that really, were pointless. As to the loss of key characters....Looks like #7 will fill in the blanks. Overall, I feel that the book was rather mosh-posh with no real unity."
5,Holding me over till Book 7,Oy- I'm eagerly awaiting the Deathly Hollows so I've been rereading thee first 6. Great story!Tucker O'Doyle by Jason Rider there are two in the series so far. Good stuff too.
5,To counter act all the undeserved negative reviews...,"this book was brilliant, and anyone who says otherwise does not know what they are talking about. As a Harry Potter book, it is perfect, and finally, finally, we're getting more in depth answers. Everything is falling into place, and JK's briliance and genious shines througout the book as we learn about the horcruxes, the identity of the half blood prince, and many other things.The murder was shocking. And I felt my emotions take a ride in this book as I laughed, and cried, and shouted out in anger. And now I once moe feel excited, for finally the end has come and after we read teh next book it is all over, we will know what happens.This book is brilliant. It is not a waste of time, it is actually one of teh most thought out and entertaining reads published this year, and it will have a special place on my bookshelf for many years to come.Read it - or you'll be the one to miss out."
4,The best of Harry Potter series,I really liked the Harry Potter series until I read the fifth book which devastated my interest. But i did read the sixth book for the sake of it and really enjoyed it. I couldnt stop reading it till the end came. It was better than the rest Harry Potter series and i think J.K. Rowling did the best job.
3,"The darkest book so far, and one of the saddest.","This book was okay. It was a little sad at the end. As usual, Rowling is remarkable with the world she created and the story she has to tell. I can't wait to read The Deathly Hallows to finish out the series. Even though I knew most of what happened during the book and how the series ended, I still couldn't help feeling sad and angry at some of the stuff that happened. That's how emotionally moving this book has been, and it's the most emotional one thus far, even more so than Order of the Phoenix. I even wondered a time or two that Rowling was really torturing Harry Potter by having him lose all the people he cares about. This is probably the darkest book so far, and the writing wasn't that bad either."
1,Disappointment,"At last the true screw-up in the story dies...and that's about it. The story is too predictable. I have tried reading it again to see if it'll be better the second time around; and I just close the book after a couple of chapters. The first five books were magical to read. The sixth reads like a GHOST WRITER (for those of you who are young that is someone else that writes the book but is published under the ""author's name"") got it published. If the seventh book is this disappointing, I won't want to read it."
2,My Thoughts,"As I began reading this book i admit that i had already formed a grudge against it. Yet as i continued to read i was sucked in by her wonderful inventions and ideas. However her imaginative side could not overshadow the horrible writing. Using the same work over and over again in a paragraph (power)...its just too much. Also, i found it odd that she chose a ring as the object that voldemort must need, why a ring? Consider this, in Lord of the Rings, it is based upon such an object. THis story was almost a direct copy of LOTR, with the basis being the ring and its power to control people, even Harry himself. He admits the ring calls for him, which rings true in the LOTR series. I am ashamed that JK Rowling could not come up with something better than a spinoff of LOTR."
1,"J.K., Stop beating on the Guy","In every one of her books, JK beats up on Harry. The Half Blood Prince is no exception and the worst such example. I don't know if JK gets some sadistic pleasure in hurting Harry or if she thinks this is the way to sell her books. Fact, you are rich now JK. Give Harry a break.There is enough hurt in the real world without your dumping on a young man in the wizard world."
3,I still am disappointed,"When I started reading the books I was excited. I think by the fifth book, I was expecting too much of the writer. I was disappointed with Order of the Phoenix because it killed my favorite character. In this one, I am beyond sad because it was so slow. I read it in one sitting this morning because I wanted to finish it but all I can say is I do not really care for Harry as he is being portrayed.Dumbledore got a little better this book but still too philosophical. I was not surprised by the ending though I had to say my new favorite character Snape was kind of maddening. I hate these kind of cliffhangers and I hope she has the next book out by next July if just to finish the series for me."
3,Harry is a Muggle.,"Harry Potter is a Muggle, Huh, what do you mean he's a Muggle? Harry beat Voldemort the first time because of his innocence, the second time he beat him because of his bravery, the third time he beat him with his honesty....While we are on the subject of honesty: Harry doesn't want to become a Wizard! Why you may ask? Harry does not believe in Slavery, Tattoos or missing limbs....Freemasonry has turned into a den of thieves and the governments of the World are all involved in it....Harry may die in the final book, however, he will die on his own terms, taking the high road, and as usual, making fools of all you (alleged) enlightened people."
4,I'm depressed!!!,"I would have give it 5 stars, but because I really dislike how the book ended so........yeah.......I'd actually cry . You'll find out who is the Half Blood PRINCE!. Expect the worst when you come across toward the end, I still can't believe _________ died. It had ruined my day, my week, my summer, and my next school year. AHHHHHHHHH!!!! There were some puppy-loves going throught out more than the rest of the siries, which was very cute and very annoying. Hope you enjoy the book."
3,WAHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NO, OMG NO!!!I HATED THIS BOOK! WHY DID DUMBLEDORE HAVE TO DIE? Although, maybe it'll be a good thing cuz then Harry will be on his own in the last book. Also, maybe Dumbledore isn't really dead! Cuz Harry survived the curse so how couldn't Dumbledore? He's one of the most powerful wizards! HOW COULD HE HAVE DIED THAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!!"
5,Another excellent book!,I've enjoyed all of the Potter books so far. This one was just as good as the others. The ending was a little depressing and was very upset by it but I feel it was part of Rowling's plan so I have dealt with it. Can't wait for the next one!!!
2,Count me among the disappointed,"I started thinking with the fifth book that J.K. Rowling's extraordinary success must be reason that her publisher doesn't insist on having someone edit her increasingly rambling work. But this is the first book I just didn't enjoy. The plot is . . . well, it's hardly there. I found the book entirely put-downable until the last 150 pages, or so, when it rises to the level of somewhat interesting. The person who is killed is the very person I anticipated would die next at the end of ""The Order of the Phoenix."" By the end, the only interesting character is Snape.I'm still planning on reading book 7, in the hopes that this book was a clumsy set up for a masterful spike."
5,The Best Book Yet,This is the best of an excellent series of books. I can't wait for the next one. The movie of the Half-Blood Prince should be a knockout.
4,best so far!,"Bravo! This book was by far the best one yet. I just wish I would have known that I needed to remember everything from the other books. This one has a nice continuum and give you insight in the live of the caraters. The only thing I regret is the Rowling has started this new trend in kill main caratheres and Harry is going to and up along in the world at some point. What for?If you remember details for all of the other books, please keep reading and if you are like me, well keep reading, it will come back to you at some point."
4,"very obviously a ""bridge book""","although it was quick-paced and suspenseful, this installment of harry potter left quite a few unanswered questions, even ones from book 5. this disappointed me. JK Rowling has left so much hanging. i felt like this book could have been summed up nicely in, say, 200 pages. i hope the 7th book is 1200 pages long and solves everything. by the way, i was tearing up at the end. this is the order of the books from best to worst...5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4, in my opinion."
4,The half-blood prince,"I got my book yesterday afternoon and read until 3 this morning. I agree with many of the reveiwers that this book wasn't near as gripping as the others, I also loved the Prisoner of Azikban. However, JK is doing a good job of rolling toward the conclusions of the book in a concise and understanding manner. I think the saddest moment for me was the realization that the story is almost over, and there will be only one more book to look forward to. I do think there were a few surprises in this last book, I would like to beleive that things aren't all what they seem at the end of the book. To me, the ending was too predictable, so I am hoping this is a ruse to throw us off the trail of the last book. I do disagree with getting this from the library, even though this book wasn't as good as the previous ones, The value is in having the entire series. I think these stories will outlive us all. Every child needs to read them."
4,Not enough story for the length,"I am a die-hard HP fan, but apart from Voldemort's history and the extremely heart-wrenching ending, there was not much to the story.... Too much ""snogging"" and too many pages devoted to teenage crushes....... I found this story extremely disappointing for the most part... Seems like a filler for the climax.... with nothing better to do, Jo Rowling turns to commercial means to fill the pages. Not a word more, else I'll give it all away."
3,BEST BOOK EVER,"IT WAS REALLY DESCRIPTIVE AND THE PLOT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD SO, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,leaves you yearning for the next book,"if you've read the first five books you should know that the series is one of the best of all time. Extremely addictive, count on a couple of sleepless nights"
5,Outstanding book,"I just finished reading this book for the third time, and I must say it gets better each time I read it. An obvious must have for any Harry Potter fans, the book really builds the reader up for the seventh and final installment of the series. The story was, as always, well written and quite an enjoyable and engrossing read (the first time I read the book, I read it cover to cover in one sitting, getting to sleep around 4 am). J.K. Rowling creates characters that you either love or hate, and this book is no different than the rest in this regard. I'm now among the millions of other Harry Potter fans miserably waiting for the seventh and final book to see how the series ends up, as Half-Blood Prince leaves you in such a cliffhanger. It's akin to the season finale of your favorite TV show, leaving you dying to know what happens and how things play out. I would highly recommend the Harry Potter books as a series, and The Half-Blood Prince as an outstanding stand-alone read."
5,Awesome Reread,Great!!!This is the second time I read the book and I usually don't do that. I got bored and decided to re-read it and was pleasantly surprised that it was just as interesting as the first time I read it.
5,It Strengthens Marriage,"I didn't think I would read the latest installment of the Harry Potter series. However, at a recent wedding, one of my best friend's wife had a ringing endorsement for this story. It apparently is so good that her husband will read it to her aloud in all the accents, even if the English accent comes out Jamican. Could you ask for a more lovely use of literature than bringing man and wife together."
5,Love and Hate,This book is amazing and full of excitement and surprises. It totally redeems the last book and keeps your attention the whole time. Iread it straight through on the first day it came out and I am about to read it a second time to get more of the details that I might have missed. it has been well worth the wait and those who have not read it need to read it fast because the secret of the ending will leak fast.
5,"once again, amazing.","J.K. Rowling once again has given the public an amzing book. She successfully allows the characters to grow up in a most realistic manner. All main characters have realized that their hormones are raging, especially Ron. The plot circles around Harry finding out the secrets of Voldemort's life while he was still Tom Riddle. Harry, also suspects Draco Malfoy of some untrustworthy activity and takes it upon his own hands to investigate. Another main plot-point of this book is Harry's new found skill in potions as well as interesting curses with the help of ""The Half-Blood Prince"". The book moves along well and never drags. The ending is most shocking as it ends with one of the ultimate betrayals that leaves Harry confused and alone."
2,jGreat Disappointment!,"I expected so much from this book since all the hype about it but when I read to the last page, I was expecting so much more out of it! All the reviews ranting about how scary it is, is all FALSE, it is nothing compared to the third book and I demand a refund for this."
3,Not fit for young children,I find book 6 not fit to be read by children below 13. It's too violent especially the last part when they were fighting against the death eaters. I don't know if Rowling will be able to end the story on her next book. Harry hasn't reach the level yet in which he'll be able to beat Voldemort. I did not like this book as much as I loved The Goblet of Fire. I would not recommend mothers to let their children read this book unless they're mature enough.
4,Great Book - Mediocre Formatting,"It's a Harry Potter Book - of course it's great! (And a lot better than the movie.)The formatting is, at best, mediocre. The table of contents looks as if it should ""hyperlink"" to the appropriate chapter, but I've been unable to get that feature to work. Additionally, the chapters jam together with no clear separation between them.Some of these formatting issues impact readability - paragraphs broken in the wrong places, mis-spellings, and other typographical errors.If you're a forgiving reader this shouldn't be a problem. If you expect decent formatting for $20, then you may be disappointed."
3,Probably the weakest book of the lot,"Compared to the other books in the series, this book was slow, hoo hum and, for the most part, boring until the final 100 pages (good ending!). Definintely not a page turner like the three previous books and it times, put me to sleep (literally) . I'll rank this book as the worst of the lot. the book, overall, is still enjoyable but after reading, Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Phoenix, this book was a let down.In the Half-Blood Prince, JKR is obviously setting the stage for the grand finale which based on what needs to be accomplished in the next book, should be EXCELLENT.If you are a fan of the series, I guess you have no choice but to read this but keep your expectations in check.Cheers!"
5,The best Harry Potter book yet!,"This book is not for the very young. At 24, I was gripped from the very beginning and couldn't put it down until the very end. You learn a lot from this book that explains a lot about the previous books. I can't wait until the final Harry Potter, hopefully it will be out soon!!"
5,HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!!,"omg!! this book by far is the best out of the series, that's not saying much cause they're all AMAZING!! I don't want to give anything away for those who still have resisted to read it but.... I think this was the darkest book yet and held so many surprises. People kept switching sides, it's confusing and you're not really sure by the end. The first two chapters have nothing to do with the story line, true they're boring, but stick with it!! This # introduces a new plot that was never mentioned before. It kinda makes me wonder if Rowling had it planned out or not. In conclusion, this book has gotten me sooooo psyced (did i spell that right?) for the newest movie coming out in november 2005. so all in all this book is definatly worth the time it takes to read it. Althugh it has a sad ending, it makes it all the more eager to read the next one!!"
2,Was she under the Imperious Curse?,"Was JK rowling under the Imperious curse when she wrote this book? The entire thing was just very boring and tedious, and what was with all the sudden relationships? I mean come one. Could they stop making out for one minute and take a breather and get to some actual story and character development. The beginning of the book was probably the best because it started out with a nice flow, unlike previous books from the series. And near the end of the book, something happens that will most likely make you say, ""What the heck did she just do?"". I think many people will be disapointed with this book, but im sure there will be a lot who will absolutely love it and say its the best one yet. This book was just highly disappointing and Rowling better get cured of that Imperius curse and right a book that closes this series with a bang."
2,disappointing,"I was really disappointed after reading this book. It read like an overzealous, teen-age angst fan fiction. there was no substance at all, it seems liked the ending was a set-up for book seven. it was fluff."
5,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6),I LOVE HARRY POTTER BOOKS AND THIS ONE WAS GREAT AND THE BEST ENDING...! I RECOMMEND IT ANY ONE FOR A GOOD READ...!!!!!!!!
5,"Great book, Was in England when this came out",5:30 Am Stanstead Airport All of the WH smith stores are selling harry potter. I got a copy and began reading. I wont give away the book but i simpley could not put the book down. I finished it in less that 24 Hrs and because of the time difference by US standards i was one of the first people to finish it. I am telling you this book is not the dissapointment that i found the last one. Explains alot of past myteries (like how voldemort is immortal). Get this book right now
3,THE MOST HORRIBLE OUTCOME,I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD IN THE BEGINNING AND MIDDLE. BUT UNTIL I GOT TO THE END WHEN DUMBLEDOOR WAS KILLED I DIDN'T WANT TO READ ANYMORE. I JUST SAT THERE CRYING AND DON'T KNOW WHY J.K. ROWLING FELT THE NEED TO KILL DUMBLEDOOR. THAT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE AND UNEXPECTED OUTCOME!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A very good book,A worth waiting book indeed...never regret a single penny I spent on it...only wish I could grab the next book in the series as soon as I finished the Half-Blood Prince...
3,"Definately not her best,but...","at least it's acceptable. I think she probably hit her peak in book 3. Book 4 was alright,but 5 was a nightmare. I've read every single one of my books at least 10 times over...except 5. I couldn't even bear to read through it a second time in preperation for book 6. book 5 is horribly written-it's all SQUASHED. I doubt she could have forced the actions of the characters any more quickly had she tried. Book 6 seems to be much more on her typical level,though it's still a far cry from books 1,2,and 3. Hopefully 7 will be as good as the original trio,I'd hate to see such a long series end on a sour note."
5,Couldn't put this book down!!!!,"As an avid reader who considers myself to be rather well read, I would highly recommend the entire Harry Potter book series to anyone ages 12 or higher whether they have seen the movies or not. Those who have seen the movies will appreciate learning the in-depth elements of the story that the films don't have as much time to get into. Those who have not seen the movies will still find themselves drawn into the amazing fantasy world that JK Rowling has brilliantly created. I truly believe that this book series will go down in history as one of the world's great literary achievements. Once you start these books you can't put them down, and I simply can't wait for book #7!!!"
4,My Favorite Harry Potter Book,"This book is so good. I love all the Harry Potter books, but this one especially. At the end, I was so mad at Snape I just felt like jumping into the book and performing the crucacious curse on him (yes, I am aware that doing this is highly illegal and cruel, but still, you get my point: I hate Snape). Surprisingly, I actually felt bad for Malfoy because his life has been torn apart by Voldemort. One thing I really liked about it was how you got to look into Voldemort's past, before he turned himself into a monster, when he was still just Tom Riddle. Another thing I like is how half the book was taken up by stuff about relationships (especially the part when Harry and Ginny kissed). That made it more fun to read."
4,harry potter and the half blood prince,"It's a great book, though not as good as ""Goblet of Fire"" which remains my favorite title in this series to date. The idea of traveling through the memories is a little long winded but it pays off big in the end. All in all it was worth the buy and i cant wait to see what happens next"
5,best 1 yet!,"the 6th Harry Potter might be the best!i was shocked at who the ""half bloo prince"" was at the end! And u may have noyiced that about 1 person dies in each book, well its true for this 1 too. it is amazing who J.K.Rowling made die!that will make u sorta sad, id bet money on that! with a new defence againset dark arts teacher harry struggles. but with help from the ""Prince"" he becomes highly hounerd by slughorn (aka new teacher) in a certain subject (i will not tell u wich subject). very important stuff happens. it is a awesome 10 out of 5 star book! u must read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LIKE PEANUTS"
3,Potter contines,"Slow, slow, slow........That's what this book is, If it hadn't been next in line, I probably wouldn't have read it. Probably the worst of all the books."
2,four out of five ain't bad,"This review was perfect, and I had to quote from William Norton.""Save your money. Reread book 5 if you want to enjoy a good time with Harry Potter. And To JK Rowling please take how ever long it takes you to finish book 7 but, do not rush it out the door. Your readers and Harry deserve better than this."""
2,very dissapointed,"First of all, let me say I am a total Harry Potter fan. I just love Harry! I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, and started waiting the minute I finished book 5.I started reading about 3 PM on Saturday, and in between doing stuff in the house, and getting dinner and my kids to bed, I finally fnished it at about 1AM Sunday morning......I did not like the book. It's more than that... I don't like the direction this story is going. It's no longer the same story that it was in the beginning of the series. The death (won't give it away) makes no sense to me, and in my opinion, changes the whole shape of the story....To me, it is no longer a book about the 'boy who lived' and his adventures at Hogwarts, but a vigilante / indiana jones crusade of Harry's. I find myself not caring when or if or what happens when book 7 comes out.It's too bad, too... I was so looking forward to this one :("
5,My Favorite Harry Potter Book,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince happens to be my favorite of the Seven Books. What I like best is the insight it gives into the character of Snape, and the fact that we we learn something about his childhood, and what he was like as a student at Hogswart. It also outlines some crucial plot details and explains many unanswered questions from the previous books."
4,LOVED book 6!!,"I know I'm behind the times since I've just finished reading Book 6 and it was great! Loved all the Harry/Dumbledore interaction, further focus on Ginny, Ron/Hermoine, and without gtting into spoiler territory for those 3 people who still haven't read this book...lots of great twists and turns!!I started reading Book 7 last night. Sad this series will be over :("
2,What a shame. JKR Has decided not to make an effort.,I'm sorry to say I could not wait for the book to end. It was borring and anti climatic. I think it's the worst of the series. The first 4 were good. The fifth was not to good. This one is just continuing on the downwards spiral.
5,A Definite Buy!,"Ok, now this book was not what anyone was expecting, im sure. Jam packed with some much action and suspense that you cannot stop reading. It did, i have to admit, contain some parts that were not very mind captivating, but i guess thats how all books are. However, the use of imagery is incredible. J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer and when it comes to putting pictures in your mind, she is the best. She definatly makes it so that it flows with the rest of the series and does not jump around too much, causing havoc to the reader. This is definatly the best book of the series, and is a very good beginning to what is going to be the best book ever written (the 7th book of the series), at least I am hoping for a thick, action/adventure novel complete with imaginative imagery, and suspense filled chapters. This book is a definate buy."
4,Not Quite What I Expected,"I was really thrilled when I got the sixth Harry Potter book. I'm a huge fan, and I've read all the other books.My first reaction was that it wasn't quite as good as the other five. It just felt like things were being set up for the grand finale. It does give us some insight into Voldemort's childhood, which is interesting, but things just didn't feel connected. There wasn't the same flow, or time spent on character developement. The events in the book sort of fell out of the blue, they didn't feel as well tied in as usual.That being said...J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, who has a wonderful talent for making believable characters and a believable, though magical, world. I love her books, and I love this one as well. The reason that I didn't like it as much is that it had a tough act to follow, books three, four and five especially were great. It just wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be.But it was still a fantastic read."
5,Not Just Another Book,"I have to agree with others here who have said that book six was indeed more lighthearted. I was hesitant at first, after re-reading book 5 and remembering the betrayal Harry felt at the first of that book. This one, however, gives the reader a sense of relief, if only briefly, that Harry and his friends will plug on and enjoy happy moments despite the darkness looming around them.There are funny, if more mature, moments involving all the students-Ron, Hermione, and Ginny providing many of them, and Rowling does not let down her fans in giving them what she knows they want--if, again, only briefly.As for the important details--Snape's trustworthiness, the Half-Blood Prince, and the ending, which, is a total shocker and fatal blow to the hearts of us all, some questions are answered and some are set-up to be answered in the final, and probably most powerful chapter.Cheers to Rowling for once again taking us into this magical world and beyond the barriers of ""just another book."""
1,jordanmaddie HP half blood prince,This was a totally UNpleasant experience. First the wrong book was sent. Then I received a shabby extremely worn copy of the correct title. My original order was based on the promise of a new book. I did not receive a new book. The book I received - from a different seller since the seller from whom I ordered sent the wrong one and clearly did not have a new copy of what I ordered - came from a bookseller who remains unidentified so I would not know where to return it. I have spent considerable time and additional postage dealing with this and am extremely disappointed. This affects my attitude about Amazon also.
5,Different but Essential,This book deffiantly wasn't what i expected. I found this one answered many questions of mine even ones i hadn't thought about! Some people say the fifth was darker but i deffiantly think the sixth was a darker tale. I enjoyed learning about voldermorts past and the romance was good and probably neccesary though scenes with ron and lavender got a tad tedious. All in all a fantastic book though i wish it was longer and wish we got to see more into harry's lessonsp.s if **** died. couldn't people still ask his portrait for advice?
3,Missing the Magic,"I'm a true die-hard fan of the series, but truth be told, I was really dissapointed by this latest installment. The problem was two fold: First, the previous books included liberal amounts of brilliant humor which softened the darker notes. I think I chuckled ONCE in 650 pages of HPatDP. (Maybe George and Fred Weasly, who pretty much just get a cameo appearance, used to get all the good lines.) Secondly, this book also noticably lacks all the fun little side details that bring Harry's world to life; whether it was interesting food or candy, hillarious hexes, creatures hiding in th living room drapes, a little swamp left in the hallway... it all gave the previous books so much charm that this book lacked. Was it still a good read? Sure, but all in all it just seemed a bit lackluster."
5,"Thank You, J.K. Rowling",I just finished the latest installment in the Harry Potter series and it was wonderful. This book gives us much more insight into the major characters (good and evil) and sets the stage for the final confrontation coming in Book 7. Tissue is highly recommended for the final chapters. The fact that we as fans are emotionally impacted by the death of a character illustrates what a wonderful job J.K. Rowling has done in creating this world and making us care about Harry Potter and his friends.
4,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,I felt a book for teens shouldn't end on a sad note so minus one star. Most people read books to lift their spirits and this book left one wondering if good will triumph over evil. It left me thinking Harry might loose the fight in the end. Will the author kill Harry Potter or will he win? It could go either way. I am intrigued to see how the next book will end so plus four stars.
4,"Waited for so long, not 100% satisfied :(","I am almost 23 years old, and got hook with Harry when my little brother bought the 1st book, ever since I just got so much into the story that I finished reading the book (and the others) in matter of a day!!.. anyway, each of the books present new and interesting characters, secrets discovered, questions answered & more mystery! and lots of magic of course! yet this new book HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, was slightly disappointing.it's 90% repetitive. Just new stuff about Lord Voldemort but, Snape being -nevermind, almost let it out-.. well, in other words you sort knew already what was going to happen. :( But!! yes!! BUT!!! the book is more serious than any other and Harry actually stands up for himself, which is good. I loved it when he talked back to Snape!!! heheheRead it!"
2,"FIller, filler and more filler with big type to boot","This is not a book that deserves to be on the same shelf as the other 5 in the series.It was shorter than the last one, and I swear that they made the print bigger to get it to 650 pages.Most of the book was filler setting up for book 7. I liked the old school stuff about ""he who must not be named"", but the rest just seemed to droll along.The book seemed like it was rushed, which is a shame given the detail of the other 5.This one will be easy to do as a movie given that the whole story should be easy to tell in 90 minutes.Sorry, J.K., love the series, but this time, you let the fans down."
3,Harry Potter and the Major Disappointment,"The book was well-written. Props to JK for that. But really. The plot? To put it bluntly, it sucked. The Half Blood Prince's true identity was no surprise (to me, at least) and the death was completely unnecessary and ruined the book. It made no sense, didn't move the plot along, and made Harry even more alone than he already was.The end of the book saddened me when Harry seriously considers not coming back to Hogwarts the following year, and thinks it would be more fufilling for him to go to his old neighborhood and look his parents' graves.3 out of 5 stars"
4,Decent addition to HP series,"Occasionally the dialogue was mediocre, but overall, the book moved well and developed the characters nicely. I'm looking forward to the next one, er whenever that is.And in light of some other stuff I've been reading, this one's pure bliss to read."
4,"Good, not the best though","While I wasn't a huge fan of the first two books in the series (they were decent, but nothing spectacular), it changed with Azkaban (so far the best of the bunch, IMHO). Book 4 was great in that it departed from the similar formula of the first three. I really enjoyed five, despite Harry being a bit too whiney for my liking--the best part was the further development of the somewhat ""minor"" characters (i.e., Ginny, Neville and Luna). I was looking forward to that trio playing a more significant role in book 6, but was disappointed. However, book 6 is still almost as strong as 3, 4 and 5. It certainly isn't as action driven as they were, but the narrative provided by Dumbledore is interesting and provides much needed background and drive for why voldemort is the way he is.Overall, I think it does what it's supposed to do, build up the suspense in anticipation for a grande finale."
5,insane,"ok straight up anyone who thinks harry potter is for kids, and i will admit i was startin 2 lean in that direction, book six will shut u up as it did me. this book is crazy. good crazy, but still crazy. the ending will kick u in the balls (or lack thereof) and leave u wanting more then any of the previous other books. get it with out question and read it in an insanely short amount of time as i, and as i presume many others, have done. peace out"
5,The brillance continues,"This is no ordinary children's book. ANother brillant outing by Rowling...another dark story and one that can be a bit scary. Death, revenge and love. Some might be disappointed that this book merely seems to set up the final book (which might have be 1000 pages to answer everything!)...yet, the revelations are strong, the gang has really grown up, and we see much less of Hagrid who had become tired. Yes, a very sad death is in here, but Harry learns from that too. I'm most sad that the series will end in one more book..."
3,Just a Summer Read,"There are about 100 pages of fast-paced action in this otherwise bloated book. I felt like there was really nothing that ""grabbed"" my attention for the first two-thirds of my book. Upon finishing it, I felt like this novel was merely a transition between books five and seven. All in all, feeling a little let down by this one."
2,Harry Potter 6 breaches the gap,"Without giving too much away, I believe Harry Potter 6 will satisfy the curious. It answers questions we've all had about the similarities between Harry's past & Tom Riddle's past. It furthers the development of personal relationships and, for once, answers questions about the recurring evil that is Voldemort.Please don't be alarmed if, halfway through the book, you're feeling un-satisifed on the drama or turn of events - it goes to a place most unexpected and surprising. I suggest - to anyone who's never read the HP series...wait until Book 7 arrives - then start from the beginning. You won't have had to wait as long as us for the conclusion.Enjoy."
4,Exciting,"Harry Potter's 6th adventure is very exciting and recommended to everyone. It has been a pleasure to watch Harry grow up and now to see him as a mature young man. J.K. Rowling has set up a finale that will leave people excited about this series for generations to come. I know that many have been sad about the ending of this particular adventure, but I think that surprises will abound in 7 and that things are not what they seem."
5,Excellent,"I have absolutely no complaints with any part of my purchase. Great service, shipping, condition of product, and quality."
2,Ugg.,"I was expecting a lot from this book... it was the first one I attended a 'midnight party' for - and thus was very disappointed when I realized it read no better than a common fanfiction.There were few (if any) points of comedy held between the covers, and this in itself was very upsetting. The plot was hurried and lacked detail, and the way Harry kept sneaking off belayed his age in the book, making him appear to be eleven again.I honestly understand why certain things happened, but I'm extremely disappointed in J.K. this time around... this book lacks many things that could drastically improve the quality of the story. I can only hope the seventh book in this series is better."
5,I can't believe I now have to wait probably 2 years for more,"I love the Harry Potter series. The characters have been bought to life and have grown from children to adults. New characters have been introduced and old ones evolved. The story in Half-Blood Prince sets up the final show down beautifully while still being a complete installment on its own. Many questions answered but many more spring to mind. I will be very sad when the series ends, I feel like they are now friends who I'll miss when I can no longer visit with them."
4,"Entertaining, yet a little disappointing","The moment I began the book, I could not put it down. And when I finally finished (8 hours later, skipped dinner, didnt shower, put off assignments, ignored friends on MSN), the amount of anticipation for the sixth book that have built up for the past year and a half (not sure) has increased as I genuinely anticipate the last book. However, I would beg to differ to say the book waas the best ever. I particularly found the romance bit silly, with alot of unnecessary ""snogging"". However, the development of the characters were good, especially with Draco. Definitely worth reading, and I hope the last book will be as good as ever."
3,A whole lot of effort for a middling book...,"I simply do not understand how this book recieves critical acclaim from reviewers all over the country! Basically, the plot is: just another year at Hogwarts, and some twists at the end. It felt like a good chunk of the book was somewhat predictable fluff, and that even the title didnt really AMOUNT to anything in the end. If this book were a color, it would be beige. Easily forgettable, you could skip most of the book until about the last few hundred pages which are well worth the effort because of the key shocking events. But for the most part, it marks a further decline in the Harry series."
4,Improved writing,"Others have summarized the plot of this latest book; so I will content myself with saying that Rowling's writing has improved considerably--or the publisher has finally paid for a good copyeditor. There are virtually no dangling modifiers for a change, and much less of ""Harry's scar burned with pain beyond belief"" in all its permutations. My sense is that the writing has grown along with Harry as he matures--there's a significant improvement between ""Phoenix"" and this latest book.I'd rate this book as second to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" in depth and reach."
3,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.,"I am so disappointed in this book. I was hoping after the last book that JK would some how bring Sirius back from the vail. But she has let me down as well as many readers. The book was very good until the ending. WHY? Can not a fantasy book turn out well?? She has brought us to love and admire Albus Dumlbedore through 6 books and kills him in the end?? What was the reason? There is none. And why should we just accept that fact? Reality is hard enough. People are dying and being killed every day. This book could have ended with a hopeful note and the desire to read more. I probably won't read another for the threat that Ms Rowling will kill someone else we love in the series. She has left me with a distrust in her thought processes. We read books for an escape from reality, from work, worries etc. Harry Potter books could have been that escape, but they have grown dark and dismal. Readers beware."
3,Needed more,"I am a Potter-head. My favorite of the series so far is Goblet of Fire where Harry is a star, but he shows his humanity and his age which makes it more endearing. I also liked Order of the Phoenix. Lots of good detail about the Ministry of Magic. I've been to London, so i can imagine these places...This last book was not in step with the rest of the story. I think the Half-blood Prince should have been revealed long ago and had more impact in the series before now. It wasn't a surprise to find who it was... never liked that character at all.Okay, the last book will be on it's way in a couple of years then that's it. Hope Ms Rowling makes it a 2000 pager. It will take that to wrap up the loose ends that we desparately need tying off!"
3,not exactly accurate description of condition of product,"Hi,The seller did tell me that the first tape was broken but I thought that was something I could repair. However, when I got the ""boxed set"" of tapes, 3 were missing. That's a lot different from ""one being broken""."
5,great books,"I was browsing amazon, trying to find books for my kids. I am very happy with the selection here. My older kids loved this book. But for my 4 year old, I got I HAVE A PROBLEM by carolyn apel, and he loves it! For my 7 year old, I got DR JONES AND CAROLYN also by carolyn apel, and he was thrilled with it. All of them are books that I ENJOY reading. Harry potter is adventure, and carolyn apel's books are funny and educational. I love Dr. Jones and Carolyn because of the humor."
3,Probably the weakest of the series thus far,"Following up on the excellent Order of the Pheonix with this book was a huge letdown. While a decent book in its own right, knowing what J.K. Rowling is capable of, this book is probably the weakest of the series so far. While there is a death at the end that is upsetting, the final chapter seems weak and forced. It seemed like the whole book was just a setup for book 7, which, although I look forward to reading it when it comes out, I am not as excited as I have been thus far with the series. While the rest of the series is filled with twists and turns throughout, this starts strong then seems to drift along to the end. The rest of the series I read in one sitting. This one I plodded along with as it plodded along.Another thing to note: as Harry Potter gets older, his experiences become more mature. While the first and maybe the second book are OK for younger children, the older Harry gets, the older his audience should be."
5,Finally We Get To Learn The REAL Spells,"At last!Finally, J. K. Rowling presents us with the REAL ways and means to create REAL magic through the Dark Arts! Children have been waiting so long, patiently hanging on every word of text so we can progress in our magic, and AT LAST Rowling delivers! I have personally cast my own star charts through the lessons in this book and its predecessors, and with the POWER I've gained, the future looks REALLY GREAT! My mother never bothers me anymore because I charmed her into promising to get me the next volume the DAY it comes out. The MIDNIGHT before! My father didn't like it, but two minutes of the Cruciatus Curse made him change his tune as well. I'm not so good at Necromancy, all I've been able to do is reanimate my kitten after a potion I gave him didn't go so well.All I can say is ... THANK YOU, J K ROWLING! THANK YOU for giving us the POWER of the DARK ARTS!"
1,Harry Potter isn't a fantasy...It's a twobit franchise,"J.K.Rowling is a sell-out for sure, but she is also a hackneyed unoriginal author who employs a repetitive overly formulaic series of the most generic good vs. evil cliche. This series is only here to spread her grand merchansing scheme...Wow! No wonder everybody loves her novels! Idiots...pick up a real book."
1,Worst yet,"I loved the other five, but this one was so bad I hardly know where to begin. It's packed with cliches, the characters (both new and old) are poorly written and didn't feel authentic, and the plot's solution was obscure and disappointing. Anti-climatic.Oh yeah and JKR decided to rip off of Lord of the Rings with this one too.So this is what pregnancy does to an author?"
1,Sorry piece of junk,"It seems, from reading the other reviews, that some people were lucky and others were not. We were not. The first one simply quit after using it twice. We took it back and got another The second and third ones would not spray cleaning solution after the second or third use. We took the second one back and got another, but it did the same as the one before. By this time we gave up and sprayed cleaning solution on the carpets ourselves without using the machine. It sprays water only when you push the trigger then picks it up as though it thought it really did something. We won't get another Bissell. We started to take this one back at first, but that is such a hassle that we made do using it as I said.The self-propelled feature is nice, but the unit is badly made and not worth the money. I guess we should have taken it back and got our money back or a different make of shampooer. Next time we will forget about the Bissell."
4,Gets the job done.,"Kinda expensive. Could've rented a rug doctor about 7 times to break even on this. But I guess is nice to have one handy for quick clean ups as I have 3 small children. Used the upholstery tool on my 14 upstairs and looked great. Self propel is ok, it shoots out cleaner in forward even when you don't have the trigger pulled. I disengage the self propel to clean how I want."
5,Cost more at Sears,I purchased this floor and carpet cleaner at Sears yesterday for $$$. plus tax which made it $$$. I was going to use it today but when I got home there had been a water main break in my neighborhood so.....no water!!! I will say that it is a very heavy machine so I'm very happy it is self propelled!! I guess I could have saved some money by ordering it but I didn't check at Amazon first.
3,What kind of fan are you?,"Ok, i bought this book because it was the only title available at the bookstore. I find that this book is for one certain type of fan. If you want to look at Madonna on a global, cultural scale, this book is for you. It's purpose, in my opinion, is to situate Madonna, explain her and compare her to others. But it seems like there is soooo much talk about other people, there's no Madonna. The author throws in her name here and there, but, if you're like me, it won't be enough. If you're the kind of fan that wants to read about Madonna, and no one else, you just want info on her, this book isn't for you. Let's be honest- all we want to know about is Madonna. I don't care about other actors or singers or 1950's radio. Get to Madonna!"
1,Poor customer support,"When I first bought this vacuum I thought I had a good product. Then the belt broke and I found I had to send off for a new belt. Parts are not carried in the stores. Then after waiting a month for the new belt to arrive, I had to call their customer support repeatedly to ever get the darn thing delivered. Then they delivered one belt instead of the two I had ordered and paid for. A week later one of the wheels fell off the vacuum cleaner. I went to Wal-Mart and bought a Hoover."
5,A real page turner,I couldn't put it down. The author's conclusions are superb. I love his take on how history is a web of independent decisions that lead to a conclusion. He does a good job proving his thesis using the events of 1776. The best takeaway for me is that the story gives me courage and when I am tempted to think that my life and circumstances are difficult; I only need to think about those poor men in the New Jersey winter. They accomplished so much with so little! We owe them a great debt.
1,Very Disapointed,"One of the worst books ever written on golf. I don't know who this Behrens Is, but he should write about something he knows.I review many golfing books a month so when one of my staff brought me this one I was fooled into thinking it might be worth something ( has a nice cover ) but I was wrong."
1,Chop-Socky Golf?,"Golf is a game that takes a long time to learn to play well. There are thousands of golfing self help books and if you ask anyone who plays the game well, they will tell you that there all a waist of time. This book is just like the rest. A new spin on an old con. The best thing to do is aquire a teacher and learn on the course."
1,Photos of Factory Culture but not the Factory Itself,"This misleading title is yet another book to cash in on the Warhol era. The title states ""Photographs of Andy Warhol's Factory"" when actually maybe half of the photos are of the 2nd factory and the rest are pictures of factory people hanging out at Max's Kansas City, or going to some guys wedding! Who cares! If you expecting to see ""The real Factory"" and factory culture then forget this book."
5,This one is a 10 star....,"After the miscue of ""Flashback"", I was absolutely thrilled that in ""High Country"" Anna was the Anna of earlier works. She's back where she belongs, in the high country, tough, gutsy and totally enjoyable. The plot is great, the characters are believable, and the scenery is beautiful. Thank you Ms. Barr. I am not going to waste words doing a synopsis...the dust jacket does that. So, to all of you who were so disappointed with ""Flashback"", please run out and get this one. It's great."
4,One of the better Anna Pigeon mystery/thrillers,"National Park ranger Anna Pigeon, working undercover at Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel, is trying to find out why four young park employees have disappeared. Her nosiness uncovers some very unsavory characters, but also provokes suspicion and hostility. She nearly gets killed while hiking solo in the high country but survives by being brutal with her pursuers. And that's not the end. Most of this story moves along at a good clip; Barr's use of language ranges from good to superb. Her description of Anna's fight for survival in the mountains is particularly effective. On the other hand, some of the scenes in the hotel and dormitory are rather ordinary. All in all, a good read."
1,Canon SLR,Bad quality pictures I try playing with the perlite and shutter speeds and have been through three rolls of film and I'm still not impressed
5,A gereat tool and timesaver,"What can I say but, EXCELLENT. It beats renting one. I was able to complete the project at my leasure. Every once in a while it would jam, but it was easilly fixed."
4,Bostitch Pneumatic Nailer,"I have used the nailer for almost 1500 sq. ft. of hardwood flooring (3/4"" t & g Brazilian Redwood). The nailer works great with only one flaw. When the clip of nails gets to the end it may jamb with the last nail. Even if it doesn't jamb the last nail falls out of the nailer. Getting the gun unjambed was not particularly hard, just time consuming. The instructions for the nailer could be better. Otherwise the nailer worked great. Used a Porter Cable pancake compressor."
1,Buy spot cleaner and paper towels instead,"What a waste. This does nothing, no power, no suction. Don't waste your money on this thing."
2,Make sure you read all reviews before you decide.,"I purchased this several months ago to handle small, minor stains in our carpets. Our house is only a year old and spots had begun showing up so I thought it was time to get a hand held spot cleaner. I had previously had an older version of the spotlifter that did not have the Powerbrushes and had been really happy with it. (We had used it to clean dorm carpets and it wore out after a great deal of use.) I thought this model could only be an improvement. WRONG. The suction stinks. As anther reviewer said it would only suck up about 1/4 of the water solution it put out. It is VERY, VERY loud! Do not try to use it if the kids are asleep or they will be up momentarily. My best advise is to borrow one if you know someone who owns one and try it."
1,Brush Drive Assembly Fails,There is a clutch mechanism in the brush drive that is a defective design. The little plastic cogs wear out if the brushes get stopped by pushing it too hard into the carpet. This is easy to do and there is no way to know you are doing it. Mine is worn out after using it maybe thirty times to clean up small pet wetting accidents. The suction is pretty weak also. Most of the liquid stays in the carpet.
1,I should have listened to the other reviews!!,"I never do this, but I wasn't satisfied with the product and now I'm stuck with it....so I thought I should let others know. Listen to the reviews, the suction on this is horrible. And I noticed the same thing that others were commenting about....you put cleaner in and it doesn't suck out nearly a quarter of what you put in....leaving you with wet carpet. I would not recommend this product.Thanks"
1,don't waste your money,"I had a small similar machine many years ago. This one is a very inferior machine. The suction is very very poor, it will pain your finger putting down fluid since it is not an electric pump, but a manual trigger like those on bottles of cleaning fluids. Also, the tank for the cleaning solution is very very small. Basically, a can of woolite carpet cleaner and a good brush can do the job as well and more conveniently than this rip off item that is over promoted by the info from the manufacturer."
5,"Unbelievable efficacy! cleaned red wine, cat urine, vomit and more!","I am currently wanting to buy an upright machine as effective as this handheld. The operator of this machine must know to tilt the machine to create the sucking action, if you leave it flat there is no seal created between the front suction piece and the carpet. But I never had a problem with lack of suction. My only complaint is that I am petite 5'1 with small hands and this makes it difficult to grasp the back reservoir tank for pull out/removal so I would wait for my husband to get to it. But I used this machine about three times a week for 4 yrs now and have loved it. My brushes are finally so full of hair and crap that I need to take them and really clean them but this machine takes a beating and gives you your old carpet back. the only stain that it has not completely cleared is a coffee stain on my white carpet that sat for a few days before I got to it. So it was my fault. The machine is loud but very effective."
1,no suction = no value do not buy,I bought one of these based solely on the bissel name. I needed to clean some upholstery and did no product research. I unpacked the system and gave it a try. After spraying the solution on I got no solution sucked back up. As an experiment I saturated a cushion to see how much it would return (expecting something at least) the collection tank was still bone dry. I returned it and will look at other products.
1,Poor Performance..Had to return it...,The suction was so bad..left the area wet...I had to return it. Would not recommend it..
4,Great Buy,"I have almost white carpet that is ""brand new"" according to the previous owner of our home. However, a month after moving in we noticed our floor was looking dingy and spotty. So we moved our couch back and it was horribly spotted underneath. We went ahead and used the rug doctor as a temporary fix, but I wanted something for occasionally spills and such. I also have a two year old daughter so we have the occasional juice cup leak.The Spot Lifter took out all of the spots. When some of the spots reappeared two months later they weren't nearly as dark as before. It only took about half of the time this time around to get it all out.All in all you can't go wrong with this product for the price."
2,Absolutely Terrifyingly Loud!,"I read a review that someone wrote about this ""little"" machine being as loud as car wash and I just thought that was impossible for such a little machine to be that loud . . . well, he wasn't kidding! I have a Bissell Steam Cleaner that is more quiet that this!"
1,Don't Buy This- Sprayer Problems,"The first unit I had didn't spray at all. I called Bissell and they exchanged it for another unit. The replacement sprays a very small amount of solution on the spot and I must wait several seconds to pull the trigger and spray again. It is frustrating to get the solution on the spot, pouring it on would be easier. If I hadn't gotten this as a gift, I would demand my money back, but alas it will be yard sale fodder."
1,no suction!,"I have had several people try to get this spotlifter to pick up moisture from carpet, but we can't make it work. We tried different angles and making sure everything was properly attached. VERY disappointed"
5,Works Great,"This is gross to say, but I use this when my cat usually chucks up a hairball. I had a rechargeable one, but it always needed juice at the worst times. The cord is long and you can get around easily with it. It also is very easy to clean. Just pop out the container and rinse out. Worth the money!"
2,"Great, until.....","I bought this yesterday after having the older, cordless version. The sprayer was horrible on this one, manual vs. automatic on the older version, but I figured I'd deal with it as we have pets and young children and were in a desperate situation! It was great yesterday...the spots I worked on showed improvement. When I went to use it today, however, the sprayer was putting out more of a drizzle, even with a full tank, and suddenly I realized the powerbrushes were no longer rotating. I checked them out and realized as another reviewer wrote, the plastic gears are worn away! I would expect that over time, but not in 24 hours! This goes back to the store tomorrow."
4,Great Head Support,I bought these for my 2 little ones. When I bought them I had a 1 year old and newborn. Now it's almost a year later and they still are the best thing ever when my girls fall asleep in the car. It supports their heads from wobbling over in the carseat. I do admit it's a pain to put on because it's so thick but well worth it. Highly recomended.
2,Not for dog hair,"This is a big upright that is pretty hard to push around. Plus, the way it's configured, the dog hair (I have three) gets stuck on its way to the cannister which means lots of cleanouts. And when you use the hose feature, it doesn't have enough power to pick up much. I'm on my way to sending it back right now."
1,It's been replaced,"At first when I bought this vacuum, I loved it. But after using it for just a few months, the suction decreased rapidly. I began to really hate vacuuming. I recently replaced it with a Dyson, which I'm loving a lot more. I recommend you save your money for a better vacuum."
4,Classic American West,"Although not approaching the genius of Stephens' sonnet sequence on Ledbetter Beach or his narrative ""White River Poems"", this is still a classic Stephens primer. His insistence on attention to detail will draw the reader in and keep her there.I had the privilege of studying with Stephens in Santa Barbara, and his wit and intelligene constantly amazed me. These are evident in the poems.If you are seeking a fresh voice from the American West, please pick up this book. And if you find a copy of ""White River Poems,"" do yourself an enormous favor and buy it immediately!"
5,Paid for itself on first job!,"This is a great labor saving tool that I have used extensively. The Quik Drive works great if you just play by the same rules you would use with any screw gun. DON'T LET THE BIT GRIND! Quik Drive includes 2 free bits in every box of screws and this is more than enough if you don't let the bit spin and round off in the screw head. I can typically get through several boxes of screws on one bit. Stay on it and follow through, remember this is a screw gun and not a nail gun. If you start having trouble, check the bit and replace it if it is rounded. Do this and with a little practice, you can save 50-80% of your labor. This is one of the best tools I have ever used!"
2,There are muh better products out there,"This screw gun works fine, but there are much better products out there for the same price. All of the Superdrive products I have used work better than this gun, and the screws are more available. We have two of these guns and both of them have jambing issues, driving flush issues and little levers and adjusters breaking issues. Try the Pam system, superdrive or Hilti Superdrive..."
2,Save your money,"ZZ top is a great band thats why ig ave this 2 stars.....but this greatest hits album lacks there early stuff. Its mostly from 77 and on like there MTV days when they became ""pop"". If you whant there early stuff (wich is better in my opinoin buy there first 2 albums)."
4,zztop,mostly fun to listen to...on the way to work it is motivating! I don't care from Track 5&6 but that is a personal preference.
5,Inspiring.,Sybil is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it a few times. I recommend it highly (especialy if you are into psychology). Have fun reading.
4,JJ and Boris are at it again,"The story gallops along at a good pace and is populated by interesting characters. There are some sections with such crisp dialogue and plot development that I had to stop and reread them to savor the scenes once again. In the latter part of the book, we get some fascinating new insights into JJ Donovan the man. Nuff said."
5,came a hot friday,"This movie is a childhood favourite paticularly to my husband. While a little bit of a disaster movie, it is essentially hillarious, especially with the inclusion of our favourite comedian Billy T James as the kid. Great family movie."
5,Helluva DVD!,"This DVD set is excellent. Your get insight into how the individual minds of the band work (minus Gillian, as she was talking care of her and Stephen's children from 2001 to 2011). This concert showcases their recognizable hits (True Faith, Temptation, Byue Monday, etc...) as well as songs from their then-recent album Waiting for the Siren's Call. This is not concert footage you haven't seen before (Bernard flubbs lyrics, dances around etc...) however I think it's worth it for the second disc alone, as it contains rare and never before seen footage of shows from their hayday."
3,It's Battlemaster!!!,"Well, I am somewhat biased due to memories of this game as a kid, but this game was certainly good enough to buy. If you do though, buy cheap because in reality the fun factor gets bogged down late-game by the obscene difficulty. The music is also pretty depressing. It's as if the person scoring it only had access to 5 notes on the keyboard. Pretty fun for the most part though."
4,Mostly great!,"I really like most of the features of the Catch All. It cleans a floor in a way that no broom ever could. The floors just feel CLEAN under bare feet. I also love that it is cordless. I only wish that the collection cup was a little bigger. I live in Hawaii, with 18,000 sq ft of linoleum and the red dirt here is awful. It has been a huge help with my dd allergies though. She sweeps her floor each night and it really helps to keep down pollen and dust that would accumulate in her room."
2,What a waste.,"This doesn't work very well, the battery doesn't stay charged long enough to finish the job. I am throwing it away because the only thing it is really good for is taking up my precious space."
2,"An alright collection, but not their best work","I used to have this album. The title track rocks, and so does ""Tragedy Man"" The song ""Breathe"" which closes this album all of this is a fusion of Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. Which isn't a bad idea, but the songs are weak, and it seems like this was a rush job, and not well planned. I know Rick Rubin produced this album as he did with the first ""Trouble"" album, but some artists just don't sound good in retro which is Rubin's speciality, so this is what we're left with.....an attempt at grunge, but doesn't cut it as heavy metal, or grunge."
4,Would/have recomended,"I've never had a problem with my RotoZip or Zipmate except one...But we'll get to that. I've used it to cut Mexican floor tiles, standard tiles, Cinder block, paving stones, grind sheet metal.... NEVER A PROBLEM! The one problem I did have is to lend it to someone else without giving them the manual first. You can't run it at the Rotozip's top speed... Other then that never a problem."
3,"Great price, wrong size.","This seems like a great filter and it was a great price, but somehow I ended up with the wrong size. I very possibly could have been that I entered the model info incorrectly."
5,is what is is - nails,"Got this for my manual floor nailer for strip 3/4"" HW flooring. Works great, just what you'd get from HD or Lowes, just cheaper! ;)"
2,Bad Shipping Policy,"I ordered two packages of 2"" flooring cleats. Instead of putting both packages into one shipment, they were shipped individually and I was charged double the shipping. It seems that since they were picked at the same time they should have been shipped in the same box which would have been cheaper then being charged double shipping and handling. I strongly advise not to order 5 of anything"
5,"Bargain Price, Firm Hold","Great nails!These have worked well in 3 different brands of guns.(Ramsond, Bostitch, and whatever the cheap Harbor Frieght brand is)These nails generally shoot in all of the way, but when they don't they stand up well to a nail-set. Best thing is that they're about $5 cheaper than Home depot and ship for free!"
2,Cliffhanger game review part 2 part 1 is on Cliffhanger Sega CD reviews which is the version I'm reviewing,So in this game Qualen's men are good fighters but Qualen's men weren't very good fighters except for a couple but they still made stupid mistakes too. Oh yeah Qualen is cheap too Qualen hid behind his henchies Qualen was a p--- he got @zz kicked by a Mountain Rescue Climber. So Cliffhanger the game no matter what system you pick it up for SNES GEN Sega CD it's another in a line of awful movie based games tieing in with a movie. Don't even get it for your emulator just get the movie here on Amazon instead. The movie is actually something I give repeated viewings.
5,Now I know!,"Your interest in this book will depend upon how curious you are about the world around you. The people at HowStuffWorks have returned with another tome of difficult questions answered in an approachable way. (The only caveat is that the explanation does not always answer all parts of the question.)It includes descriptions of how Caller ID works, how much ""all the money in the world"" is, as well as the immortal ""Why is the sky blue,"" ending on the ambitious titular question.This is an ideal bedside (or lav-side) book and if you are interested in trivia or how the world works, I recommend it without reservation."
3,Good book,"The book was well written and very hopeful. I brought up some really good point I'd never have thought of. Also the best part, was that it was really, really funny."
1,What a piece of s**t,"I did not expect great things when I bought this piece of junk, but, I expected something. I needs cleaning out every three minutes. The suction is almost nonexistent even when cleaned out. It is made of cheap plastic, and whoever desigend the thing certainly never planned on it being used as a vacuum. If you need an anchor for your canoe, with a little lead weight added, this might work. Other than that, it is good for nothing. (...)"
2,Interesting book but NOT for learning the basics,"I don't recommend you buy this book if you're looking to learn the basics of how to bind books. Styles like coptic and codex are not specifically covered here in clear, easy steps. Instead, I have to go hunting for info and pull together a semblance of something useful from several of their silly (but creative) projects they've stuffed the book with.Beginning bookbinder, don't be fooled by the description given for the book! You'd be better off searching for bookbinding information on a website such as Craftster."
3,Nice illustrations.....,"I picked this book up before I was starting to get really serious about making my own journals. I was disappointed once I started looking at it for ideas. It has tons of pictures, but little instructions on how to make what you're looking at. More details would have made this a great book."
2,BallQube Box Too Short for Commemorative Cereal Box,"The product description for the acrylic box led me to believe that this specific acrylic box would fit my commemorative cereal boxes of the USA Gymnastic team---I ordered 6 of them only to discover that the boxes were too short (by less than an inch) to fit my commemoratives. I contacted Amazon about the problem and Amazon graciously paid for the return of the boxes, at no expense to me, and quickly credited my account the day I put the boxes in transit...very impressive. My only problem now is that I still do not have a reasonably priced acrylic box to fit my commemorative boxes...I need ones that are at least 13 1/4"" x 8 1/4"" x 3 1/2"" ...is this too much to ask?"
1,Disappointing audio book,"This refers to the audio version only:The wife has read the entire series one after the other and really enjoyed them. Since I'm in the car for my job I listen to a lot of audio tapes. I liked the story well enough, but the reader is terrible. For some reason he thinks Banks' voice is deeper than whale dodo. He strains to get the deepest possible register and frankly I found it very annoying. I mean no one talks like that. It may be that the reader has no confidence using his voice for femine characters, so he uses his regular voice for the female characters, then feels he has to go super low for the masculine. I managed to get through the whole book but just barely.I tried another of the Bank's series, but got so irritated at the unbelieveable voice I had to give it up. If I ever get the time I'll have to read the series as I sort of enjoyed the story."
3,Good for a light read...,"The book was well enough written, and the mystery sufficiently engaging, to satisfy my need for some light reading. I was not particularly convinced by the moderately superfluous romantic entanglements of the detectives, however--they seemed to be tacked on as an afterthought, and really did not bring much to the story."
3,"Central mystery was only so so, but liked the detective","I didn't care much for the central mystery in this novel, but I did like the detective who was solving the crime -- overall a good read."
3,Not as described in writeup.,It is not 3/8 and I find this just too stiff for my little one. But if she were not so small I suppose it would be okay.
1,Never advertise something you don't have.,I never received this item. If the seller didn't have it available then why advertise it? This is very bad practice.
5,Classic,This a Classic film about the pimp game. Goldie is my hero. this is and will always be a timeless Classic.
4,Fast Delivery,I received the product in record time I was very pleased with the fact that it was delivered so fast. The movie was in perfect condition.
2,Comfortable but irregular,"After wearing them, I do feel that the left one is smaller than the right one so I'm using the shoe stretcher to hopefully make it fit better. Since Enzo is famous for its comfort fit and unique design, hope the manufacture won't make the same mistake in all future shoes."
2,very uncomfortable,"i fell in love w/ these online and ordered two pairs, one each in black and white last year. I paid $40 for each pair and was severely underwhelmed. WHile they look great, they are the most uncomfortable flats that I own. They are a bit narrow and too snug for my slightly wide feet even though I order them a half size bigger. I would not reccommend these, however if you have narrow feet they are an okay buy for the current price."
5,Great Energizing Workout!!,"I bought this DVD as an alternative to Ellen Barrett's Barefoot Cardio and I like it even better. This routine has great flow to it so you lose track of the time going by. Ellen stresses that you should focus on form and, if you do that, this is a challenging workout with cardio, toning and stretch. This is a good low impact workout. I don't like jumping around and feeling like I can't follow complicated choreography. Ellen's moves are fluid and relatively easy to follow. She explains that her exercises complement the feminine form and that you don't need heavy weights to get a strength workout--you can use the weight of your own body. This is challenging workout that energizes and relaxes."
1,"this is basically an ""in class"" production and a bad one at that.","This is basically an ""in-class"" taping and a very bad one at that.Which is a shame since the exercise regime could be a good one if you could get past the droning soundtrack, intermittently audible cues, and vertiginous cinematography. Ellen Barrett drops a few grades by showing so little respect for her audience as well as the talent contribution of other professionals.Unless you already know her every move by heart, and are a die hard fan, avoid this."
4,Soothing cardio stretch,"Fat Burning Fusion is a wonderful cardio/stretching DVD especially for those over 50 or for those who have back or knee problems. Also a good ""in-between workouts stretch"" for high impact lovers. Ellen's voice is soothing but upbeat and inspiring. No cutsie cheerleading pump up here! You do get your heart rate up but it's definitely not as strenuous as high impact aerobics. It's ballet, pilates combined which is great for your back and muscles. I didn't think I'd like the barefooted idea but that's turned out to be a wonderful asset! I will buy more of Ellen Barrett's workouts."
5,fat burning fusion rocks,"This is a great workout. Ellen's cues are easy to follow the very first time you do the workout, and it gets better each time you do it. You get everything, cardio, abs, stretch."
3,Good for learning electonics w/PSPICE,"This book was required for my electronics class and the only thing it helped me learn was using PSPICE. The explanations of the operations of different devices are not thorough enough. I ended up using the Sedra/Smith Microelectronics for learning the different concepts. I used this book for only required homework problems. I would recommend Sedra/Smith, Microelectronics, for a complete and thorough introduction into electronics and semiconductor devices."
2,Electronics,Topics are not well-put in this textbook. It is not really helpful. There are much better electronics books out there.
2,"Great idea, but poor execution","Although not typically an early adopter, I jumped at the chance to try this vacuum out, hoping that a new technology would make desultory chores at bit more palatable. But alas, the box went back the next day. Living with this vacuum means living with a large, toaster-oven size battery charger that makes loud fan noises as it reconditions/recharges its rolling-pin-sized battery (initially for 24 hours, then 30 minutes at a clip.) Plus the vaccuum itself was strangely unwieldly, with cheap plastic wheels that rolled uneasily in their sockets, instead of the smooth tracking rubber wheels I would expect of a high-end vacuum. Even without turning the thing on, I knew it was a goner."
4,Wireless Heaven,"I have used other cordless vacuums but this one is far superior in every way. It has much more power and the dual battery packs is a big plus in giving you the extra amount of time needed to finish the job with power to spare. The addition of the telescopic hose with 3 different tools is also a big plus and makes this machine a lot more versatile than just having a cordless stick vac. The only fault I have found with the unit is the way the onboard tools are attached to the unit. They easily fall off while you are using the vacuum. A better holding mechanism would be a great improvement, otherwise I rate the unit A+."
1,Do not buy this!,"When I bought this, I was excited by the cordless feature. BUT the vacuum does not pick up anything heavier than a feather. I thought that a cordless vacuum would save me time because I would not have to plug it in. But this is not the case. I was constantly having to change the power packs and emptying the canister took way too many steps. Also, the charger is always plugged in, wasting energy. The vacuum comes with 2 battery packs, but only one fuse for the battery packs. So you have to order the second fuse. <br />The hose does not click into place easily, so when I use the vacuum, it constantly falls off. <br />I have had this vacuum for only 1 1/2 years but it is already broken. Although I am sad that I have to fork out some more money for another vacuum, I am glad that I can finally get rid of this piece of junk.<br />I ONLY recommend this vacuum if you have a serious lack of outlets in your home, minimal dust, and no carpet."
2,"Convient, but ineffective","I love this concept, but until this vaccuum can perform better, it is not worth the convenience. It claims to be 15 amps, but the sucking power doesn't even come close to that of a 12 amp plug in model. I'm returning mine tomorrow, and purchasing a plug in. Hopefully in 10 years when my plug in dies, the cordless will be up to par."
4,Batteries need conditioning,"Quick reviewNeeds constant cleaning. Heavy as heck, batteries lasted about 4-5 months before they wouldn't charge.Westinghouse wants $120 for new ones.It's a throw away vacuum after 6 months unless you want to plop down another $120. Buy a Dirt Devil or Eureka. But not a Shark!Note: I found out the batteries needed reconditioning, not replacement.The vacuum is still running after years of use on one battery still. The other battery did die, and I bought another one off eBay for $30."
4,Love This Vacuum,"I bought this at Bed, Bath and Beyond on clearance. After getting it home and charging the batteries (yes it does take a long time, but it's worth it). I used this on my rug that had just been vacuumed with a eureka corded vac, I could see the dirt in the fill cup. It is convenient and easy to use, although it is a bit heavy compared to my eureka. It works well on my rug, wood floors and ceramic tile.Customer service is a dream. Since I bought the floor model, I was missing some pieces. I called customer service and they shipped me all four parts, free of charge (did not even ask for a receipt). I received them in less than a week.This vacuum gets used every day in my house and does a great job vacuuming up pet hair (two dogs, two cats and a rabbit) along with the messes my 18 year old, 11 year old and 2 year old boys leave.Although I would probably never spend the $300 regular price on any vacuum, I think this vacuum is a great value(...)."
1,Don't waste your time nor your money!!!,"I bought this item in October and have had nothing but problems with the it. Not only the first one, but the second one that the manufacturer sent out as a replacement. Westinghouse normally makes good products, so I was amazed at the waste of money I spent on this product. The suction is not even there, the hose is a great idea; when it is not falling out of its holster area. Worked so-so on tile butreally lacked suction on carpet.I have a vacuum that I don't even use. The idea is great but it should have an option for cord use and I think that will help a little since it works better for the first ten minutes and then goes down hill fast from there.The place I purchased this from was a dude also... even after all of my problems they wouldn't even give me a refund."
2,Almost sucks,"I bought this BRD thinking in remember the great first album from CC.Many years has passed and the band is just a sad pale shadow wich they was. The frontman sings really bad now, the musicians are like clowns made stupid movements pretending to do a enjoy sensation playin' again. Not at all. Don't buy this failure product."
4,Happy Boyfriend,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday because he mentioned how much fun it was when he was younger, but his older brother sold it. I bought the game and it works perfectly. I am extremely satisfied with this product."
1,Unfortunetly,"I was really looking forward to playing this product, however when I recieved the game it didnt work. Im really disapointed"
1,Not that good ..........,"It was a little fun, but notas fun as Hydro Thunder for the Nintendo 64.That game is fully 3d and a BLAST to play."
2,The Greatness is Almost All Potential,"With an exciting premise, and with other hilarious similar books, ""Government Training Manual for New Heroes"" and ""How to be a Villian"" I had high hopes for this book.I was a bit disapointed to be frank. The quizes weren't very clever and the jokes rapidly staled. I'd recommend one of the other books... (but in my superhero obsession, I'm still not giving this away...)"
2,The audio is bad,The volume is very low. The noise is loud. The same woman read all the poems. Two stars for the rarity of the audio material on the market.
2,"Whew, glad that's over",This book is really dry and hard to get through I thought. Kind of wishing I had not bought it....
2,Your Life: Why It Is the Way It Is and What You Can Do About It - Understanding the Universal Laws [Paperback],I could keep reading this...it bored me before I was able to finish the 1st chapter... not my kind of book I guess
3,"Kids like it, parents hate it","I thought this would be basically a girly version of Legos. It is, except that it has hundreds of little tiny pieces, plus pieces that are just invisible on the carpet. If your child is not good about putting their toys away when they are done, or if you have a young child or pet in your house, DO NOT BUY THIS! Otherwise, it is good for their imaginations and manual dexterity."
2,Pieces slip apart,"My 5 yr old was very excited and persistent about putting the pieces together according to the picture. This wasn't easy, and when I tried to help her, I found that the pieces for putting together the animals, were not molded to fit together, but are shaped in such a way that they can't grip each other. So we could get the animals put together a few seconds, and then the pieces would slip apart.We did not find this to be true with the non-jungle related parts, such as the blocks which snap on to the rectangular pieces. However I was very disappointed with this product overall, and will probably try to bring it back."
4,Cookin' with the Canibals,"This is a welcome release by Dave & Jim. The only thing to improve on this would have been Steve Winwood's voice and keyboards. This reminds me of ""Welcome To The Canteen"" but with much better sound quality. If the producers of this gem would release the entire show I would be a happy man.Hey, don't take my word for it, buy this one and judge for yourself. A GREAT DISK...Mr. Capaldi, you are missed greatly, carry on Dave."
1,don't waste your money,"i am a big fan of dave mason's studio material and also his work with traffic but this cd is really poor. dear mr. fantasy is the only semi-good track and it's not great. most of the songs are acoustic not electric. as another reviewer already noted the crowd noise included is very annoying and really detracts from trying to enjoy the music. plus he covers ""love will keep us alive"" by poco -- where does that come from? your money is much better spent on his studio albums."
5,Very accurate portrait,"This may be raw to some, but this is an exceptionally accurate look at life in the Bluff area of Atlanta. Those that are naive (see the opening scene) should use it as a cautionary tale. Good training film for Police, Social Workers etc"
1,never try to wash it,"I rinsed it according to the directions, now it is bent and shorter, so it doesnt fit the vacuum. this type of filter relies on being a certain length so the nut holds it on the vacuum. since it is now shorter it does not seal properly. also it now has holes at the creases!"
1,Not a good CD,"The only good thing about this CD, for me, is it's sentimental value... given to me by my mom because of the first song's message. Unfortunately, it's not catchy, and none of the songs on the CD are really. It's quite disappointing."
3,'Good Stuff' Does Not Quite Make It To 'Cosmic',"This record without Cindy Wilson is fine, Kate's voice is driving, and the overdubs are helpful. The whole concept of the album is moving on. But 1989's ""Cosmic Thing"" sounds better. The songs get a little too long, but overall is a good effort."
2,Good insights but covers too much ground,"I generally enjoy Bill Hybels' books, and this one certainly contains its share of helpful and practical insights from the Book of Proverbs. However, it covers such a wide range of topics that by necessity it cannot delve too much in any one area. I'd rather see fewer topics covered in greater depth than lots of topics covered in a rather superficial, though entertaining, way. Also, don't expect in-depth Biblical analysis; generally, this is a hands-on book and not a particularly sophisticated treatment of the Biblical material."
5,This book was my bible for a few months,"When I decided to withdraw from lorazapam I didn't understand what was happening to my body. Such symptoms! When I figured it out I couldn't even leave the house to go the doctor. I couldn't express myself anyway. Thank goodness a friend helped me order this book thru Amazon. I got the book the next day and devoured it. Every sysmptom she described I had and now I understood that I wasn't going crazy. The key to managing the withdrawal symptoms is in the poem at the end of the book. ""Know Thyself, Know Thy Bookeeper"". We pay to be delivered from anxiety thru these benzodiazepines."
4,Grabs your attention and doesn't let go,"This book has it all -- murder, kidnapping, political prisoners, mother/daughter conflicts and even an Act of God. Once the action starts, it doesn't stop. I have a few small quibbles with the book (for instance, the crime that starts the book is never fully explained), but it doesn't really detract from your enjoyment. Best of all, I liked Britt. Her frustration about her story of a lifetime getting pushed to the back burner really rang true with me."
4,Journalism,"A gadfly journalist, Alex Aguirre, is the victim of a bomb. The setting is Miami. The narrator is Britt Montero, a police reporter. The car exploded with the victim turned the ignition key of his Mustang.Later a police source tells Britt that a practice session was held in some nearby woods since a burnt Mustang was discovered there. Her good friend Lottie, a photographer, receives flowers from her supposed boyfiend that were taken from a nearby cemetary. It is August and it is superheated in Miami.Britt is following the car bombing story and also a story of missing boys. In most missing persons cases detectives don't leave the office. All the missing boys are young, fair-haired, slender.One really gets a feel for the life of a police reporter in a city of diverse people and causes from this book. It has everything including workplace issues, a hurricane, and the unresolved matter of Castro. In true top crime writer fashion all the details become relevant in the end. Wow."
1,The Black & Decker 9074CTN 3.6 Volt Screwdriver is a Fire Hazard!,"To say I am displeased with the performance of this tool would be an understatement. The only way I would be pleased, is if I wanted to commit arson. This tool's AC adapter welded itself together, melted it's insulation (Plastic) and started a fire on the wall going up to the floor joists (it was on the wall in the basement) and proceeded to burn the house to the ground. I got out alive (barely), and I am grateful for that. After recovering from the fire I vowed only to purchase tools approved for sale in Japan or Europe. Underwriters Laboratories is just too cozy with Black & Decker/DeWalt, so I will never buy another thing from them!"
2,Hand Screwdriver is Better,"This screwdriver was a complete waste of money for me, I was able to drive screws better by hand. If a hand screwdriver works better, why pay for this?"
1,Screwed-up,"I purchased the product in Sept-08 and by Jan-09 it was nonfunctional. The gears are made of plastic and the center post of the gear is aluminum. That post sheared off one of the 6 gears (configured in 2 layers of 3 gears) and rendered it pretty much useless. I am very disappointed. I will attempt to prosecute the warranty with Black & Decker, but have low expectations of satisfaction for this $16 product."
1,Black & Decker 3.6 volt Screw Driver Order,"Ordered August 6th, 2005... Amazon/Vendor notified me September 6th 2005, ""Item not available yet... Did I want to wait longer???"" NO!!! Order cancelled..."
5,exparin,"The Exaprin tablets package arrived in perfect shape, with on damage to the box, within a few days, and works exactly as desired."
1,Beware Of This Game,"I was only able to install Absolute Pinball. I could not get any of the other games installed. My computer is a Compaq 166 with 48 MB RAM. I have lots of free disk space to install these games. Here is the error message I got when I clicked on install for each game...Error extracting support files. Interface not registered.I can't believe I'm the only one that has had trouble with Pinball Madness 3. I'll never purchase any Encore Software products again, mainly because they don't seem to have any interest in their customers. I wrote numerous messages to Encore Software Support and never got a response."
1,a major disappointment,"This is a very low quality collection of pinball games. I have a top-of-the-line computer (1.2 GHz cpu, 256 M ram, etc) and some of these games, each with its own installation program, had trouble installing and running. Some froze up my machine to the point I had to power cycle. The games seem to be a collection of several independently-developed pinball games from different companies, thrown together on a set of 3 or 4 CDs, each with different setup routines and user interfaces. Get one game figured out and you have no assurance that you'll know how to run the next one (assuming it will run!). Only one of the games, ""Creep Night"" by Sierra, was worth keeping on my machine, but even it isn't up to their usual standard of quality in terms of graphics and game play, and it also has locked up my machine once or twice. If you see this product in the store, don't be fooled by the fancy box! After 30 minutes I wished I had my money back."
4,A Pilgrims Almanac,Everything Edward Hays does has surprises. He comes from a place outside the convential and displays deep spiritual understandings. Many of his pages makes one smile if not chuckle.
1,Disappointing and uninteresting,"This book is extremely inadequate and a boring read. The information contained within can be found on the internet and other more interesting and more informational guides. It is not worth the price.Some of the information contained within seemed a bit on the shady side also. Such as advice on how to run away from non-government security people, and sneak illegally into hotels. Not recommended for travelers hoping to avoid trouble.There was just not enough good information contained within the book to make this a good buy. There are so many other good guide books out there that are of better value."
4,Good for this price,It is good for this price. Just so slow to get it. it takes over two months to get it. Tripod is enough for common camera. It is very light.
3,Be sure to measure your crib!,"This product was a few inches too small for my baby's crib, so I wasn't able to use it as intended. Even so, it is a solid item and easy to clean."
3,Disappointing,"It was disappointing to find so few ideas for a group of 100 business people who don't know each other. Most of the activities are far too personal for such a group, involving sharing personal information or touching. In addition, many of the activities have no ""closure"": they simply end, leaving us to wonder, what was the purpose of THAT? Many of the activities would be fine for very informal gatherings where being silly (marching in a parade, charades, making a human octopus) and getting personal are appropriate. But business people--even my lighthearted group--expect some degree of professionalism and purpose associated with such activities."
5,Quality product and easy to use with VueScan application,"I own one of these--bought it used in 2004--and have had nothing but success in transferring images from film to digital. Initially, I used it only on a Mac G3 as that was what the Minolta software supported. It worked fine on the G3 as most of the image processing is done in the scanner. Recently, I tried VueScan [...] and found that not only was the scanner supported, it worked like a new puppy on my iMac with Snow Leopard! OK, I used a Ratoc SCSI to firewire boxRatoc Systems FR1SX FireWire to Ultra SCSI Converter (IEEE1394), but other than that it was a simple setup.Hardware vendors have every right to discontinue support for product software and drivers needed to support operating systems introduced many years after the hardware was discontinued. In the land of innovation, this creates an opportunity for software developers to provide solutions at a reasonable price."
1,"An uninformed, unhelpful book","This book, which has somehow been sent all over the world in the form of desk copies (I received 2!), was not written by a storyteller, and its contents indicate that, though the author had done some research, it was all in his office. It lacks any sense of practical application to the real teller of tales. It seems methodical and logical, but ultimately, the information is not based on practical research or practice. There are several excellent books on storytelling. This book, written by a freelance author, can only be seen as a book which seeks to capitalize on the currrent growing popularity of the art form. It is not helpful to the would-be storyteller. It is even less helpful to intermediate or advanced tellers. Save your money and purchase something that is worthwhile."
3,Sandman,"Three stars only because of the cost. I bought 15 sheets of assorted sandpaper at a dollar store for a dollar, cut to size and glued them onto the original pads with Tacky Glue. They last as long or longer than the original grit. I've not yet reached a limit as to how many times this can be done."
5,"Finally, another UNDERTOW...?","WOW! This is simply the best Debut album I have heard since Undertow. Ever since becoming a huge fan of Tool back in 1993 I have been searching for another band that could stand apart. Jonin could be that band. After hearing a few songs from their myspace page, I decided to order the cd from amazon- since nothing was on Limewire...apparently THE SECRET is just that. Well I wasn't disappointed. All I can say is that I was blown away and every time I get in my car, I'm blasting The March, The Embrace, The Secret, Flood, Breathing, etc...every song grabs you in its own way. That said, I think HEEL doesn't fit on this cd, its the weakest for me out of the 11. Its not bad, its just not as good as the rest, but regardless if your a fan of Tool, Disturbed, Deftones, Soilwork, All that Remains - then check these guys out, they are head and shoulders above their competition in today's scene. I'm already looking forward to their new stuff...the best 7 dollars ever spent!"
1,"pretty, but non-functional","I filled this gravy boat with nice hot thick gravy, and then tried to pour. The gravy boat is heavier than is comfortable, the lid is heavy and awkward to lift for pouring and is in the way of seeing the level of what you are pouring, and the gravy oozed out all along the front of the boat and ran down the sides. Need I say more? One star for looks, none for function."
2,gravy boat,"This gravy boat looks nice, but it doesn't pour very well. It is very messy to use. I am sorry I purchased it."
2,colloquial portuguese: the complete course for beginners,The book is very good but the CDs that accompany are not. The portuguese is spoken much too fast for a beginner.
1,Harry Potter is a WUSS!,Sherman T. Potter(from M*A*S*H*) is more of a hero than this jerk Harry Potter! 0 STARS!
5,AWESOME,This was by far the best Harry Potter book of all time!!! I am already counting down the days to this movies release!!
1,Harold Potter is Pointless!,Maybe that Parmly dude is a dolt for getting into this HP stuff way too much!
3,Harry Potter 4 (filmakers) A movie that could of been better.,"I am normaly a fan of Harry Potter but when I went to see the Goblet Of Fire, it was ok. I thought the set wasn't good. Neither was the director. The filmmaker rushed the beginning and the three task. The Quittich World Cup which is in the book wasn't shown. They also only showed harry in most of the tasks.The only one they showed everybody was the Great Lake task. I was mostly just not happy. It should of been longer with a new set, director,and a intermission so the movie makes more sense. I don't care if it is 4hrs long, just make a better movie."
3,Pretty Good...but,"I was really looking foward to this movie because it was the first Harry Potter film where I read the book before seeing the movie. It was very true to the book and was visually fantastic...but I did not feel that the three main characters Harry, Herminone and Ron, related to each other as well as in the Prisoner of Azkaban. I felt that the relationship between them was real and believable in that movie...and thought that is was somewhat missing in this movie. It may have had a lot to do with the pacing of the movie and the fact that it was a lot of story to fit into a 2 hour movie. Still, it was entertaining and worth seeing."
4,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"The movie was great, a high quality production with good characters and special effects, but as someone who didn't read the book, I found some parts hard to follow. That was also because of the sound in the theatre - some times the voices of the characters were too quiet to make out every word. Even so, it was good enough to follow the plot and get involved in what's happening to the characters. Brendan Gleeson was great as Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody. As sequels go, kind of like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this one has a slightly darker ending that makes you anxious for the next sequel."
4,Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire,"Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire was a really good movie. I think it would have been even better if you hadn't read the book. They happened to leave out a few things, like, Dobby and the Sphinx at the end of the movie. I was not wowed by it, but if you haven't read the book, you will think it is like the best movie ever. I'm not saying that I didn't like it, but it they could have added some little details to make the bigger fans appricated a little more."
2,Disappointing,"A fragmented, shallow,watered down spoof at best. A few spectacular special effects do little more to hide the poor quality of this horror than a pound of make-up can do to hide ugly. While I understand that in the time concerns of motion picture some of the book has to be edited out and thought they did this admirably with the first three installments in the series. Mike Newell's version of Goblet of Fire was just pathetic. It appears obvious that Mr. Newell is no fan of the books."
1,VERY BORING!!!,Sorry but not jumping on this bandwagon. The movie was dull as dirt. It was very choppy and just when you thought it was gonna get better it got worse and dragged on what seems like forever. Great if you have insomnia.
2,Not lacy!,I ordered the navy/classic and I thought it would be actual lace over backing. The lace pattern is just printed on and it looks pretty silly in person. Also the lace on the top and bottom is pretty low quality.
2,not a good fit,These boys shorts ride low in the back and do not stay up. The 2 stars is for the material and construction. The fit.... lousy.
1,"Fabulous stories, HORRIBLE editing and printing",I love George Macdonald and some of these short stories are among my alltime favorites. But I was terribly disappointed with this edition. The printing goes so close to the spine that it's a struggle just to hold the book open wide enough to see it all. The stores are just crammed in together like a poor quality homemade book. Typos are rampant throughout. My recommendation - by all means get these fables but get them individually or get a different edition of the collection.
2,Not well designed or made.,"The figure was fragile from the beginning so any handling made the cape fall off. Once it did, it would not stay on again. The only way to keep it on would have been to glue it. Fine for a display on a shelf but not as a toy for a child, not even an older child."
4,Fantastic journey,"What can you say about ""Jupiters Travels"" that hasn't already been said? It's the quintessential motorcycle travel book, a book that inspired many men to undertake similar adventures. (Just watchLong Way Roundor readMotorcycle Therapy: A Canadian Adventure in Central Americato enjoy the stories of two such men.) Ted Simon will make you shake your head in wonder of his good fortune (at times) and his calm assurance that all will be well under circumstances that would make most men abandon hope. Well written and thought provoking, this is a must read for any motorcycle adventure enthusiast."
4,Good motorcyle travel story,Enjoyed the cultural observations and practical descriptions of travel on a motorcyle almost as much as I enjoyed the look into the state of the world in the 1970's.
4,Jupiters Travels: Four Years Around the World on a Triumph,I did not read this book. It was a gift for my son who enjoys motorcycles.
2,Wake me up!,Kept waiting for the book to get better but ran out of pages before it did. I felt Simon left out too much and was just riding to put on miles. Would agree with an earlier reviewer that there was too much (fuzzy) philosophy. I also thought the material was too dated and could have been updated somewhat. I was disappointed probably because I expected much more judging by the other reviews.
4,A FAQ on Biblical Prophecy,"It's unfortunate that many of Kirban's books are either out-of-print or hard to get. Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books. A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today. ""Questions"" is a wonderful book - almost like a ""frequently asked questions"" pamphlet that deals with Biblical prophecy. Topics include: The Second Coming, the Tribulation, the Millennium, the New Heavens and New Earth, and many photos and charts that help explain the prophecies of Revelation to even a total novice. Although small, this pamphlet is packed with good information for anyone wanting to get a handle on Biblical prophecy."
1,Rubber ammo jams!,This is not a durable gun. Although spring mechanism works soft rubber ammo jams inside the gun over time. The bullets may go over 40ft but accuracy is terrible.
4,More drill than I need?,"If maximum power is a priority, this drill is absolutely your best choice. But, do you need this much drill? Although the Bosch has monster power, is well designed, and is lighter than what you'd expect from a 24 volt, it's still a handful. Its slightly larger size also makes it more difficult to fit in those awkward spots. Don't get me wrong, I purchased this drill and happily use it. But if I had to decide again, I might have given a less powerful but smaller and more comfortable Makita stronger consideration. The bottom line for me is be realistic about how much power you really need."
3,If you want power .. you got it. Think again,"I have owned this drill for over a year. The only quality I saw was power but for crying out loud who needs this much power. problems: 1. The battery is a bit difficult to remove from the drill. 2. the cluch keeps moving from high to low torque, first I thought I was moving it, it moves under load. 3. one of the battery decided to give prematurely. 4. Can you believe how much it costs to replace one battery, find out. 5. Who needs to walk around with this much weight to drill. Nothing is perfect in this world, I would say and 18 makita is all any one would ever need. I am a General Contractor. I have and used every tool out there. I had say the 18 volt makita is the right choice and easier to find replacing batteries and the like at a reasonable price, comparing to all other drills, weight, cost, reliability, manuverability, and replacement battery."
2,powerfull but built very poorly,"I have owned this drill for about 6 months now and the chuck head has broken off twice already. It does not withstand even the smallest impact on the head of the tool. I dropped the tool from waist height once and it literally sheared at the clutch adjustment. The second time it broke was at the same point while drilling a hole with a 1 1/8 bit in a 2x4. If you intend on using this tool on the job, it will not last with normal use."
2,Where's the 12ft. power cord that's supposed to be included?,"Although this charger works as descibed, it does not come with the 12ft. power cord listed in the specifications. It should probably be listed with a 12"" power cord. It is also very noisy for its size, hopefully that's normal? It does keep my BMW 740IL charged when it sit's for weeks at a time. That's impressive considering how BMW's are notorious for eating batteries when they sit!"
2,onboard charger,"I was looking for a small onboard battery charger to trickle charge a small car, King Midget, that doesn't get driven enough to keep the battery completely charged. So far it's worked as advertised. It's small and light weight so I was able to attach it to the outside of the plastic case holding the battery. Unlike other reviews, I didn't mind the 6 inch AC cord as I didn't have to worry about a longer cord becoming undone and wrapping around the chain drive.It worked well for six months and suddenly stopped working. I'm going to try another one as I liked the size.Update 2-16-2013. The replacement is still working, so I am happy with this product."
5,very helpfull,THE sCHUMACHER BATTERY CHARGER IS THE 3rd ONE I PURCHASED AND I REALLY DO LIKE THEM BECAUSE I PUT THEM ON THREE CLASSICS CARS I HAVE.I SOME TIMES DO NOT START THEM FOR ATE LEAST 3 TO 5 MONTHS;BUT WHEN I DO RUN THEM I HAVE NO PROBLEM STARTING THEM UP.THESE CHARGERS ARE VERY GOOD AND DEPENDABLE.I WOULS HAVE MORE IF I NEEDED THEM.
1,Fall apart when wet,I thought these were perfect - cheap and great reviews. But my wife didn't like them. She said that most would fall apart after getting wet. Her good friend said the same thing about these pads. Pay a little more and get the Lansinoh nursing pads. They're excellent.
2,avoid,"Even the shaggy ANGELS, with its ham-fisted count-down to the gas chamber, beats HANGED MAN. Although none of the critics who orginally reviewed it seemed to notice--or mind--only the straight people in the book come alive; the gays are an assortment of cliches, despite the book's being set in a gay resort. For some reason Johnson felt compelled to tie all the plot threads together in the last fifty pages or so--perhaps it was editor-enforced (You will not get this book published without a plot!). Johnson does much better without overt plot mechanics, and thank God he got past them. These last 50 pages are not only contrived and pointless, they are just plain boring."
4,Jesse's great as usual / producer misses the mark,"I had the great fortune to hear Jesse perform the majority of works from this album live, accompanied only by his acoustic guitar, in Davis, California this spring. So...I was anxious to get this CD. Jesse's voice is wonderful. His wit is refreshing as always. The music works. The sad part is: the producer, possibly with commercial objectives for the most part, overpowered Jesse with a great, funky, tight backup on virtually every track. I will look forward to a remake of this album, where the producer has the wisdom to put the spotlight where it belongs, on Jesse himself. There is nothing comparable to this man performing his own songs live..."
4,Works,I go through a lot of toner and tend to buy by price. This toner fit my needs-doesn't smell bad (some of the cheapies have a strong chemical odor) and so far at least (just installed about 500 prints ago) is working flawlessly. I intend to buy from this vendor again.
2,You get what you pay for,"This product lasted for all of two months. I used it often but only for short sessions. Looks nice on the outside, but a very lightweight product on the inside. True, it's made for light-duty home projects and is priced accordingly, but I'd still prefer to spend a few dollars more on a product that I can be confident won't abruptly fail. I bought a Milwaukee."
5,TRU at its best!!!,I always liked tru Ever sense they first came out n 95. They brought out hit after hit. This cd is tight i recamend this to anyone who is a master p fan.
5,An outstanding book,"This book, I found truly remarkable. It shows that prison can reform some people. Mr.Hamilton shows that there is the possibility of rehablilitation in the prison system. The sad part is the death of his mother, and the violent death of his younger brother, that sends him into a life committing crime. His come back however, is remarkable. What he has done for himself and for other immates around the world is good. Helping incarcerated fathers to remain fathers to their children even behind bars. I recommend this book to all those that think the system spends too much of their tax money on people who will never change. It will change your way of thinking."
4,Great so far,The battery is great so far. It packs a lot of power and i really liked that it came pre-charged and ready to use. The fact that it is a bigger pack with shorter charge time is also great and also that it fits in the original drill hard case.
4,Battery,The origonal battery lasted for several years of hard use. I hope these will last just as long. It was a good bit cheaper that getting it from the manfacturer.
5,Perfect Replacement,I purchased this battery as a replacement to my Black & Becker Fire Storm 9.6 V Drill. The price beat all local prices and the product is a perfect replacemnt or secondary battery.
2,Piece of garbage destined for the landfill,"Like one of the previous reviewers, mine didn't last very long at all. Actually neither of the APC backups I own lasted very long. Then I made the mistake of ordering a new battery for it instead of purchasing a new one. The new battery didn't revive the unit. I will never buy APC again - the aggravation and limited lifespan is not worth the low price."
4,great time saver,"I have the earlier model of this sander and have saved tons of time with it. Sanding action is excellent, but it tends to run a little hot with prolonged use. Maybe the newer model has been improved in this regard. In addition, it's hard to find sandpaper that fits."
4,Great Sander,"I've used corner sanders in the past that just didn't make the grade. This one does. The extendable attachements work great. I just re-finished all of the exterior teak on my 41' trawler. This is an older boat that has a lot of brightwork. I wished I'd bought this at the beginning of the project. The attachments made sanding on the handrails, compartment louvers, air intake louvers, door jambs and just general detail work much easier."
1,Short Life,"I purchased this tool in May of 2010 for my wife who refinishes furniture. As of 9/11 it is overheating and vibrates excessively. It worked well while it lasted, but is not a professional quality tool."
5,Quiet Mind,I'm in the process of reading the book. I have found some helpful info inside. Will continue to read and refer back to when needed.
4,Great headset for gamers,This is a really solid headset for the money. The sound quality is great and the headphones feel comfortable around the ear for lengthy periods of time. The microphone clarity is solid as well. Lack of 3d sound hurts if you are an FPS gamer or something along those lines however. Definitely a good purchase.
3,no magnification at all.,the build quality is ok but it seems objects are further away instead of closer. plus can't adjust for jack. still for that price it's ok. buy it as a toy cause that's what it is.
4,I'm in deep like,"I purchased this item because i wanted a non-fragile thermal french press which I would have loved...i just want my 2nd cup to stay a bit warm while i drink my first.It is a great size, it looks nice, i can throw it in the dishwasher and certainly don't worry about breaking it! I would not, however, describe it as keeping a cup particularly warm. It does keep things warmer then my former glass press but not as warm as I had hoped. Anyway, I would totally recommend it despite that and I'm in deep like with my press."
3,"Beautiful Finish, Mediocre coffee press","I love the design of the French press, with its polished stainless exterior and brushed stainless interior. The Handle is well proportioned and the pot pours nicely. The problem is with the press action. I have not been able to get a clean press without either coffee spraying out of the spout, or coffee grounds showing up in the brewed coffee. I have experimented with different grinding levels with little improvement. I also own a glass press which never leaks grounds into the pot. There is some issue with the plunger and the seal it is able to maintain during compression. I would be interested if other buyers are seeing similar results."
2,Good with a weakness,I thought this was a fine coffee maker until the threads on the shaft that pushes the strainer apparently wore out and stripped the threads so the strainer would not stay attached to the shaft. It took less than 2 years for this to happen.
2,More form than function,"As long time French press users, we hoped we'd hit the jackpot based on other reviews of the Frielling 5-6 cup. This press is impressive when it comes to form and style, but scores low on functionality. First, the ""5-6 cup"" description (assuming 6oz cups) must have been measured from the top of the pot. But with the long shape of the pour spout, there is no way to fill the pot to any more that 1 1/2 inches below the top without creating the second problem -- hot coffee and grounds spraying all over when it comes time to press. (Yes, we know to use the proper grind for French press, and we know to push the plunger slowly.)For us the 23 ounces of coffee the Frieling can safely produce is not enough to make it our daily press. We are back to our glass Bodum."
2,french press,"This is a ""refurbished"" product. In the past when I have bought refurbished items they are really like new. This one had the top of the plunger bent. It's working fine but I just hope that knob at the top that is bent does not come off. I was disappointed at this defect. Otherwise, this is a wonderful item, keeping the coffee warm to the second cup."
5,Better than glass or plastic,"This is my first French press purchase. So far I'm very happy with it. The coffee tastes great, once you get the ratio of grounds to water all figured out. The insulated walls keep the second cup hot long enough to enjoy at a leisurely pace. The stainless steel looks nice and contemporary on the kitchen counter and takes up far less space than the old drip coffee maker. If you like making a couple of cups of coffee at a time, this is a great item. And while I don't plan on smashing it, I like the durability of stainless steel over yet another glass appliance."
4,Worth the money,"This coffee plunger definitely keeps the coffee warmer longer and is durable. We live overseas and need to ship things long distance. This plunger will handle it. It keeps the coffee steamy for about 30 minutes. Much better than glass.I was a bit disappointed because there is no strainer at the spout. However, after several uses I realize it does not need one. The plunger does a very good job, so far. There are other reviews bashing the construction of this model, but I took the risk anyway. I am pleased with the plunger. The welds are fine and the handle on my plunger might be a few degrees off perfect, but it is barely noticeable and does NOT affect the function. This is a good value.Frieling USA Ultimo Stainless-Steel French Press, 35-ounce"
1,If you think this press will last forever think again...,"I have owned my 33 to 42 ounce press for approximately 8 years and needed to replace the filter.It's a 5 dollar part so I ordered 3. Shipping cost was 10 dollars and the filters didn't fit?I contacted them, they sent me a new plunger system, that didn't fit either. It appears they have changed the specs and I'm out of luck.There is no longer a filter to fit my 100 dollar french press. They did offer me a new unit for 30% off the list price, not including shipping.I must say I love my press so much I might pay the money and forget the whole thing went down...."
2,Had to send it back............A little awkward,"This product is a beautiful design, but was defective (rattling metal piece) and too narrow for my comfort."
3,5-6 cup (not) coffee maker,"Nice product, but not the size you would expect if you think a cup has 8oz."
5,Buy this one the first time!!!,"Strongly recommend spending the money and buying a stainless french press first. We have had several glass ones which made fine coffee, but they are too fragile to last any length of time. The stainless press also keeps the coffee hot for longer than the glass models."
5,Very Satisfied,I ordered two of these for Christmas gifts. Both recipients were happy with the quality of this product.
5,Fabulous!,"What a treasure this coffee maker has turned out to be! I'll never go back to glass again. We make creole coffee, a slow-brew, long-steeped process and this coffee press does a most delicious job. The carafe is very well insulated, keeping the brew hot for a long time. It's also quite elegant to look at and makes an appropriate statement at any dinner table. Absolutely worth the price."
4,great french press,"I love the taste of the coffee in this pot. Looks great, easy to clean. Big enough for one or two people. Doesn't stay warm long, but that is expected from a french press. I recommend it highly."
5,"Ok seriously,","This is def 1 of the best games of all time. If you don't have it, buy it. Also see: Zombies Ate My Neighbors"
4,Perfect For Begginer Manga Artist,"This was my very firt book my daddy bought me and let me tell you, he made a smart decision on buying How To Draw Manga: Ultimate Manga Lessons! This book is great for the basics of Manga.My personal favorite was the deep detail the author went into when drawing the head. I also liked how the author clearly showed the differences on age of the child, protagonist, younger adult, mother, and an elder.I would recommend this book to all ages, only one page with minor, let me repeat, MINOR nudity. Overall, this was a pretty great book."
5,What a great book.,Molly's upset because Christmas cannot be the same because of the war. She tries to salvage whatever part of Christmas she can and when she and her sister Jill find a package from her father they hide it so they can be the ones to surprise their family. My favorite of all the American girl novels.
5,When Dad Hurts Mom,"This is the best book available about the effects of domestic abuse on children! It's a valuable tool for self-help or counselors. I am a Clinical Social Worker and Certified Domestic Violence Professional, and I recommend this book to most of my clients who are facing issues of divorce, custody, and coping with their children's emotional needs in the aftermath of an abusive relationship. I also use this author's other book ""Why Does He Do That?"" regularly in working with domestic violence victims and survivors."
5,Black & Decker 7558 finishing sander,"Great value for $25.00, works great and does a nice job. I am using it to finish kitchen cabinets and several doors."
2,"Spend more, get more",I concur with Handy Dan. The paper simply will NOT stay clamped down. After fighting with it for 3 days I took it back to the store. Other than that it was doing fairly well. I plan on spending more money to get a quality tool that will work as it should.
3,Okay for small jobs but paper falls out.,Okay for small jobs but the sand paper clip is cheaply made. The paper falls out continuously. Wouldn't recimend... Spend a bit more money and avoid the frustration.
5,Absolutely excellent,"""The Visit"" is simply superb. Every track speaks to the listener in a different way. Her vocals and instruments combine to form a sound which conjures up mental imagery of misty hills in Ireland. Highly recommended."
4,"autumn maidens, Celtic spirits, Spanish dances","If you would like to feel the ultimate spirit of autumn, this CD is for you. ""Between the Shadows"" is Loreena's best instrumental song ever. Her talent is clearly presented on this track which is also named ""Persian Shadows"". If you play this track, which is number four and then skip to track 6, named ""Tango to Evora"" it is the best combination imaginable. As I was making a cassette of this CD for someone I realized how well the two intertwined and how gorgeous they were. This music is poetic perfection. To this day, I have never known a better artist than Loreena within the Celtic realm. When I listen to her albums, especially this one, I am taken to a Medieval world where I can picture myself wearing a maiden's garments, autumn leaves falling everywhere and the warm sun caressing my body. If I ever feel like I have found the ultimate man to marry, I will play these 2 tracks on my wedding day while wearing my Medieval wedding gown."
5,Wow!,A very emotional and spiritual CD. When I heard it for the first time - someone played it on a lively market in Bangkok (!) - I immediately stopped and I felt as if I'd been given an electrical charge...Listen track #9 (Cymbeline) or #6 (Tango to Evora) - and you'll feel what I am talking about...
3,Buy this elsewhere for $18,Whoa... These guys are proud of their cards.You can find these on the net for $18 (refurb) to $28 (new).
1,mine just quit,"I received this product for Christmas and today (just nine months later) a part of its function just quit. I've constantly had problems with it running its batteries down because it has no on/off switch and will transmit even the slightest tilt of the joypads even when the system is switched off. So I have to take the batteries out after every session. Which isn't terrible. Last week I noticed other problems with the joypads. The game's camera tilted down without me pressing anything, and would do so incessantly and uncontrollably. Today, the up and down on the right joypad quit entirely. I can crane left and right, but I can't tilt up and down at all. So, as far as I'm concerned, this is junk. I've had my old PS2 controllers working fine since system launch. A nine month life span is unacceptable. I'm just using the original controllers now... until I get the PS3. PS2 owners, avoid this item!"
5,When the tragedy inspires the life!,"Melina Mercouri plays a Greek actress in search of inspiration to play Medea. Once more the life has more imagination than you and I can imagine. So, the reality will come for her when she meets in a prison a Medea of the actual times: Ellen Burstyn has killed her three children in order to take revenge on her husband.Jules Dassin (Rififi) conducts this original proposal."
1,"Jason should be cautious in trusting his ""inside"" sources","I was there while all this was going on...I worked inside the W-2 system in Milwaukee and I met Jason DeParle. Jason does not present an unbiased viewpoint here. In fact, he trusted some unethical and self-serving sources for his information about one of the service providers, and he disregarded certain information he received via interviews/discussions with W-2 employees. You know the old adage ""Don't believe everything you read""? Keep it in mind as you read this book."
2,I don't get it...,"I'd never seen Mr. Show before but recently borrowed the third season DVD from a friend because I'd heard good things and wanted to check it out. Well, I watched the first three episodes here and I scarcely cracked a smile. I think David Cross is a very funny dude but I just didn't think much of the sketch comedy going on here. None of it seemed all that clever, well-written, or well-acted. I was at least expecting something more edgy and better written than SNL but what I saw here completely fell flat. This seemed to me like amateurs trying to emulate SNL and doing a very mediocre job of it. Maybe this is one of those things you have to watch a lot of before you start to ""get it"" because it certainly didn't work for me."
3,alright,"some of these pictures are rather funny, but some are just idiotic. its a pretty good book, but i wouldnt make it a bedtime story for your kids."
1,A disappointment,"With a few exceptions, the photographs themselves are not either amusing or even embarrassing to the subjects. The ""authors"" attempt to make the book humorous by adding cutesy taglines to the photos. The humor is laborious and boring."
2,Not hardly chunks,"I hardly ever make my purchase without some reviews. I didn't on the hardwood, so now here is a review. Purchased two bags..... what I got was not as pictured. Came in two separate boxes, one badly torn and taped up the other o.k. Size 37 in. x 21 in.x3 1/2.Poor packing. The wood was in a simple thin clear plastic bag. One bag was old and breaking open with the wood more like kindling, not chunks. Could only salvage about six pieces, the rest in trash! Now the other o.k. box had the same plastic bag but looked much newer, not torn and the wood was ""acceptable"" fair sized chunks with a few small pieces. This I can use. Srangely the order seemed to come from two diferent places, as the E-mail was in two separate orders?? Final opinion.. I will not order wood from this seller as half the order was useless. Repeat: not as pictured. The good news is Amazon will make it right..... Thanks Amazon"
2,Outdated and out of touch with contemporary society,"While the book's mission may be admirable, it appears to be somewhat idealistic. The coping skills and resistance skills suggested are about the equivelant of saying "" I don't want to take drugs because my mommy says not to"". My daughter found the book ridiculously funny."
2,Out Of Touch with contemporary parenting!,The author makes the common mistake of assuming today's children are as naive and innocnet as they were 25 years ago. The parenting techniques suggested in this book are the quickest way to lose credibility with your children. It insults the child's intelligence. This author is clearly living in the past regarding parenting issues.
4,practical golf,"Practical Golf is a very good guide to building a solid golf swing. JohnJacobs, the author ,is a wonderful teacher and has keen insight into whatit take to hit good solid golf shots. The book is a reference book togo back to when you are having trouble with your swing. Practical Golfis one of the best book on golf I have ever read."
5,Martha Stewart Wannabes... This is for You!,"I love learning new tricks for keeping house, and this book is *full* of tips! I have returned to this book time after time to learn how to treat a fever, make traps for the dreaded whiteflies, make a no-salt spice mix for chicken, and clean darned near anything. This is an indispensable reference for any homemaker on a budget."
3,Customer Service Outweighs Average Performance,"In a previous review I was very harsh about the product. No doubt, that was the result of failing batteries and battery charger. Well, the Black & Decker people deserve a balanced observation. When the charger died I contacted them directly. I was no longer able to access the charger from Home Depot. B&D Customer Service wasted no time sending me a replacement charger within 3 days, and at no expense.My expectations may be higher than others, and my do-it-yourself activities at home are probably more than most homeowners. Maybe I need an 18-volt cordless drill. So when I rate the 12-volt system as average that is based on my needs and experience. I only wish this 12-volter was as good as the customer service."
3,Verspak Charger & Batterires,The batteries and charge themselves seem to be in good shape and working. The packaging of the products were less than desirable. The batteries and charger came bundled loosely together in a box. No other packaging included so they were rattaling around in the box when the box arrived.
1,BUM BATTERIES,THIS IS A GOOD LITTEL DRIVER. BATTERIES ARE NOT WORTH THE POWDER TO BLOW THEM UP. WHY WOULD B&D TAKE A GOOD IDEA AND SCREW IT UP WITH CHEAP OUTSOURCED BATTERIES? EVER HEAR OF NICKEL HYDRIDE? I LEFT MINE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NO ONE WOULD PICK IT UP.
4,VersaPak is underated,"True, they are only 3.6 volts each, and the life is not terribly long. However, the VersaPak line is extremely versatile and affordable. The common misconception is that the batteries should last longer...but you have to consider the use -- these small, light-weight batteries were never meant to build a house, sand a basketball court, or cut through concrete, they were made to be small, versatile, affordable and light-weight. VersaPak IS NOT a Contractor-grade powertool. I highly suggest investing in several sets of batteries if you use your tools often for long periods of time (more than 10 mins straight). But consider the alternative, a larger, heavier tool that costs 3 times as much (or more), and that goes for the battery packs too. The fact is, if you aren't getting enough power from a VersaPak tool, it was not designed for you, you should consider one of B&D's other higher voltage, contractor-grade powertools."
2,These batteries don't last long enough,"I'm not sure what I expect, but I think these batteries don't last long enough. Once charged they don't stay charged long enough, and they wear out and stop holding a charge before I think they should. Maybe it's because I'm a very light user, but I'll put a charged battery in a screwdriver, remove and install a few screws (no drilling), then leave the battery in. I'll come back some days later and the battery will be dead. So, I need a sceond backup battery to use when the first one dies. I'll switch batteries, put the first one on charge, and repeat the process a couple weeks later when I need it again. After repeating this process for couple years, it's time to dispose of the batteries and buy more. Is it unreasonable to be unhappy if I need to spend $40 every couple years to have a cordless electric screwdriver?"
2,"""300 charges""? Try 20","One of my VersaPak batteries gave out completely after about 20 charge cycles, and can't be charged any more. Perhaps it's just defective, or I ran it down too far, but B&D's claims of ""no memory"" and ""300 charges"" for these batteries is way out of line, in my experience.I still like my VersaPak dustbuster, screwdriver and drill, so I'm going to order another battery. Or three. (Even though that will cost about as much as the original set of tools did, with batteries.)"
3,Versapac Gold Batteries,I have several Black and Decker drills and other cordless tools. I have been looking for the versapac GOLD batteries. They are the same dimensions as the regular versapac but they claim to have 60% more energy. Mine seem to last longer too-- between charges. Where can I buy the versapac GOLD batteries?
5,another awesome score,Batman and Batman Returns was danny elfman at his best after this score elfman would have another hit with the 1st 2 Spider-man score this guy done just about every comic book hero score there is it is only a litte behind batman for me
2,good luck,"None of these sellers list a size chart of any kind. I were a xxl - xxxl shirt and a size 38 waist. I wanted my pants a little big so I could wear layers I ordered a 3x, big mistake it says on the tag 47 - 53. Whatever the seller made returning it not even worth it. Anyone who is fat enough to wear a size 47+ doesn't have a need for tactical pants because they are probably not mobile."
1,Centurian generator has problems,"I have purchased several of these. They typically have one or more of the following problems.1: The transfer relay does not switch both circuits connected to in (problem seen in several units). It appears that the return spring is too strong for the relay to close both sides. The problem has been ""fixed"" by stretching the spring.2: Generator does not produce electricity. The unit was not getting asdequate excitation from ""DPE"" winding. A circuit breaker was limiting current to a point below that at which the unit would operate.The idea behind this generator is GREAT. Its implementation by Generac misses the mark- additional preproduction testing would have caught these bugs."
1,Cheap imitation?,"BEWARE: I purchased Tabac EDT before in a local pharmacy and it smelled great. I ran out of it and ordered this one from Amazon. It smells nothing like the one I purchased at the pharmacy. When you first spray it on it smells absolutely terrible, like strong chemicals. Everything looks original, but I think it's a cheap imitation. I question the quality control of these items. The bad part is that you can't return fragrances. I would give it a zero star, but it won't let me choose nothing."
2,Okay read,"This book was more entertaining than self-help. The self-help aspect of it, for me, was reading the things some of the people had done and thinking to myself, ""My god, I don't want to be like that."" So, I didn't finish this one. I don't consider it a waste of money though because it made me snap out of my pity mood."
3,Good read,"This book was a pretty basic overview of how to regain self-esteem and feel empowered by a break up. It also provides other stories of other people's breakups... Which helps you realize your breakup wasn't really all that bad. All in all, decent read and a confidence booster for those having trouble getting over a breakup."
4,Worth it!,"If you, or someone you know is going through this situation, then it is worth it to invest. I recently broke up with my ""blah blah blah"" and in less than 30 days I am doing great. I am surprising myself everyday and am thoroughly committed to the the 60 day rule! The only thing I would add to this book is that whatever his/her name is change it to something goofy... my ex is ""bozo"". The insights and experiences are very helpful, enlightening and motivating. Everyday I live with dignity, grace and honor - it feels great! Good luck!"
1,Break No Bones,This is one of the worst books I have read.Kathy Reichs has disppointed me for the last time.
2,Not her best......,"I love Kathy Reichs' writing! I have read and re-read all of books. There are two I would list as not my favorites. I did not like Deadly Decisions, and I did not like Break No Bones. For some reason I felt nothing for the characters in Break no Bones. I thought tense situations were resolved to clean and conveniently. There was not enough conflict between characters like I am used to. I felt no sexual tension between Andrew and Tempe. I want the fresh and hot writing from her past books. I must confess....I will be first in line to buy her next book...I can't resist knowing what Tempe will get herself into next time."
3,Previous Kathy Reichs Books Better,This story was good but I found it difficult to get into in comparison to her previous books. Overall ok story but still love this author.
3,Pretty good.,I read it 2 weeks ago and liked but don't remember anything about it. What does that say about the book?
4,Another enjoyable Bones book,"This is the 9th in the series, so it would be easy for her to phone it in. Not so however. I enjoyed this one as much as many of the others."
3,Done to a formula,"Dr.Tempe Brennan has been taking a field class with a group of students when they discover bones which seem to be too new to be connected to the ancient ones that they had been excavating. Tempe contacts her friend Emma, the local coroner for this district in Carolina and agrees to help her as Emma is suffering from a terminal illness. More bones are discovered and an involved plot centering on a sinister doctor and his even more sinister clinic, reveals itself. With the help of her estranged husband, Pete, and her present day lover, Canadian cop Ryan, Tempe finds herself embroiled in the dangerous territory of stopping a lucrative business in selling body organs to wealthy clients. It was an ok read but not anything marvellous."
1,Terrible Quality - No Warranty - No customer service,"We purchased this travel bag for our 16lb cocker-king charles spaniel. On our second trip back from San Francisco the zipper broke right before the flight. Luckily, our dog was mellow enough not to create too much attention at the airport or on the plane. When we came home I checked out the manufacturer's website and found no warranty information. I even emailed but got no response. Fortunately Petco (the retailer) exchanged this item (paid 75 dollars). If it breaks again we will not buy this brand but look for one from a company that stands behind their product!"
4,Sherpa Bag OK,"This large Sherpa bag is the right size for my large cat. Comfortable (I put it on the floor & he's been going into it to sleep)and easy to carry. The one thing I don't like is that it has a lot of netting on the sides. I expected it on the ends, but not so much on the sides."
5,Excellent!,"I purchased this carrier because I didn't want the crate type for my cat. He is an 18lb Tabby and fits perfectly into this, it's mesh sides make him feel less anxious when confined, and I can carry him on my shoulder if I need to. It is sturdy and very well made and also folds flat for storage. I previously owned the small Sherpa carrier, slightly different, older design, for my 8lb cat. It was heavily used and was still in excellent condition after 18 years. I would use no other carrier for my pets."
5,HEAVY...HEAVY...HEAVY,"Heavy is what describes this record. Produced by Steve Austin of Today Is The Day, Warlord hits their short-lived stride of Black Sabbath-esque doom metal. They even have a cool country sample on ""When Reality Sets In"".I give this one five stars. It's definitely in my heavy rotation."
2,Changed my mind...,"I originally reviewed this CD as good, but after relistening to it I have rather changed my mind. My original hope was that this was the early-80's metal band of the same name, but it turns out not to be. The person responsible for the original Warlord of the 80's has moved on to other projects, namely Lordian Guard. He himself is a Christian."
3,Could have been a litle better...,"The ink is very light, the red marker looks like a faded pink and the green and blue are borderline bold enough to see from 6 feet away. Avery could have done a little better on this..."
1,"Bad brand, not lifetime warranty, and need proof of purchase.","I bought 16GB MicroSD card. Product worked for a couple years, then failed. Customer service at PNY required 3 proof of purchase for the warranty and it is only 1-Year Warranty."
4,HUGE chair!,"This chair is much much bigger than I was expecting. It takes up a LOT of room. If I had known how big it was, I would not have purchased it. However, it is very comfortable, and does seem to hold it's shape well."
5,Great book!,"I am so glad to have found this book! It contains very helpful information on just about anything you want to learn concerning your health. It is easy to read, has a great flow! My new ""go to"" book! Love this book! Thanks!"
5,complete herbal,"This is the best book I could find and read concerning the herbal concoctions on the market today,but, make sure you get this book, not one of the many so named ""green"" books, there are many books out on this subject and some are very very similarily named.This book has almost all of the herbs listed and uses for them.I highly recommend it to herbal health persons."
3,Average with some good parts,"Not a bad horror flick, and worth a rental. Neat-ish story line that centers around a woman who seems to have a significant mental disturbance that could be a disturbance, or is there really a bizarre killer on the loose? The story is not necessarily that difficult to figure out, but it moves quickly, has a few amusing scenes and is a very watchable film. As is the case with most non-mainstream horror, the ending does get a little (or perhaps more) cheesy, but that's SOP for films. Worth a rental, not necessarily a buy."
1,Beyond Awful movie. SAVE your money!!,"I think this was supposed to be a horror film but I found myself laughing at the horrible acting, poor script and just about anything else you can throw in there. This movie was AWFUL. I love watching not so great horror films but this one was just laughable. I wouldn't recommend that anyone watch this unless they want a good laugh. I get bored in Iraq---REALLY bored but I would never watch this movie ever again and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone. For those people who gave it anything above 2 stars I seriously wonder about your state of mind!"
2,Avid Reader says Not Worth It,"My son is an avid reader, a fifth grader who LOVES to read. He picked this book to do a genre book report on mysteries. He found this book pretty boring and confusing. He has not read any other of the books in the series, so that could be part of the issue. However, he has never reported not liking a book before."
5,VP215 Performs As Advertised,"I have 3 of these flashlights throughout my house. They have been active for about 1.5 Years without any problems. The LEDs all work properly and the flashlight turns on when AC Power goes off, otherwise, the flashlight is completely off.Note: The Original Krypton Bulb Type is Philips KPR803, 3.6V, .5A. The replacement bulb sold by DeWalt/Black & Decker is the same as the VP210. The Manual states that the replacement bulb is KPR103 or PR3. These two are available at ...and ... (check ...

3,I've seen better.,"The package arrived on time but a little beat up. It was mostly the packaging that was damaged but there was one side of the bench that was bent and stopped it form opening fully. It wasn't bad enough to make me return it I just had to bend it back into place. Ive used a couple of earlier models of this bench where both wooden parts of the top move with a turn of the handle but with this one the back is stationary and only the front moves, other than that its sturdy and holds up to most of what a diy'er can throw at it. If your looking for a cheap bench for a few projects a year then get it. if its gonna be an every day use type of thing spend a little extra cash and get something a little more well built."
4,Good work stand..,"I have owned one of the original Work Mates for a long time, and found these collapsible, work stands to be very useful. This is the third one I just purchased. If you need temporary working surface, or a quick vice to hold a board for sanding or cutting, these are great tools. They are light weight, fold up into a small size, and are fairly strong supports. They can be hung on the wall in the garage out of the way till needed, or simply placed against the wall in their folded state. I use them for various woodworking use, and have found them very useful."
3,Not the good old days,"I owned one of the first workmates to be sold, back in the 1970s. Loaned it to a friend. Stolen from his patio. Friend bought this as a replacement. Compared to the original, this one is lousy. I noticed that some of the glowing reviews referred to buying it long ago. I wonder if their reviews are actually in regard to THIS product, or an earlier sturdier version.I use it often, and it is helpful, but it is more cheaply made than the original. I doubt is will be worth stealing when it is 25 plus years old. I would buy it again, but wish I had my original back! I was never ""careful"" with the original, but I find myself unwilling to exert my maximum effort on this tool."
5,indispensible!,My husband loves this. It stores easily in our New York apartment. It works just as they say it should. No complaints. Very durable. Easy to calibrate and set.
5,Thank you,"My son took m original and I immediately looked at the big box stores for another one, had differs ones and more expensive. Happy happy,Thank you."
3,Not what it used to be,Bought a Workmate 20 years ago that still functions we. At the time it was the low end model.The new version doesn't compare. Sheet metal is light and flimsy. Mechanicals are insubstantial.Very disappointing to see a great product so degraded.I won't send it back since the shipping charges make it impractical. I only it lasts more than a few months.
1,BLACK AND DECKER WORKMATE-DO NOT BUY,"PURCHASED BLACK AND DECKER WORKMATE FOR MY HUSBAND,IN THE PAST THEY CAMECOMPLETEY ASSEMBLED,THIS DOES NOT. YOU PULL THE FRAME OUT OF BOX AND HAVETO ASSEMBLE. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO PUT THESE PARTS INPLACE---FRAMEWORK EXTREMELY SHARP AND DANGEROUS. MY HUSBAND WHO IS A VERY GOOD MECHANIC,WAS SEVERELY CUT ON THIS. WE WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY-ONE. BLACK AND DECKER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT???????WE EVEN CALLED BLACK AND DECKER,THEY FLUFFED THIS OFF, CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEGIRL WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC, I TRUELY HOPE THIS WILL PREVENT SOMEONE ELSE FROMGETTING INJURED."
3,Beware of Packaging,I ordered this as a gift- it would have been nice to know it'd be delivered in a giant Black & Decker box with a photo of its contents on the side. My husband now knows what his Christmas gift will be. Very disappointing.
5,Loved it,Very good book and I loved all the books in this cerise and will read them again.. Fast read and a great message..
1,Versa-Pak NiCad - Worst EVER,"I have several Versa-Pak tools, which I really like. They are small and versatile, and get the job done when I need a quick power tool. No good for building a deck, but great for simple fixes around the house. However, I have to say these Versa-Pak NiCad batteries are just the worst rechargeable batteries ever made. They will completely die somewhere within 6 months to 2 years of purchasing them. I purchased 2 of the 2-pack/charger kits (4 batteries), and that's what mine did. I subsequently replaced them with the NiMH batteries (which work with the same chargers), and they work like a charm. Stick with the NiMH batteries, and avoid the NiCads like the plague."
3,Black & Dec;ker Dust Buster,"I presentlly am keeping these batteries as a spaare. But having used the product before I'll tell you they don't have a long life and are expensive, based on the initial cost of the product that these battaries operate."
5,Contemporary interpretations of classic music,"Another reviewer hit it on the head: This disc shows that even in these classic compositions, there is plenty of room for innovative interpretations.Forget the ethnocentric nature of some resposes. ANYONE who is a lover of music will love this disc. Wonderful work is done here on some very familiar songs, such as the Boys Choir of Harlem's rendition of ""Glory To God"". ""And The Glory of the Lord"", ""A Child Is Born"", and ""Every Valley Shall Be Exalted"" are nothing short of contemporary masterpieces.The best, however is the Hallelujah Chorus. It must be played loud, in the house, in the car, in the office, or anywhere else. It is the most inspiring music I have ever heard. Somewhere, Handel is smiling and marvelling at what has come from the wonder which he penned two centuries ago.Everyone should own this disc!"
4,"Soulful, uplifting, innovative",Product had really innovative sounds that were both historical as well as spiritually uplifting. Handel's soulful rendition is one I have been looking for ever since I heard it many years ago. Its arrangement has no equal in soulfulness with its uplifting gospel sound.
5,Amazing! Saved by the Balsamic Glaze BELL!,"Oh my goodness! How amazing! A lot goes a long way!I had a catering job coming up and attempted to make the balsamic glaze. I cooked down 1 1/2 gallons of balsamic for 24 hours...and it only reduced in half, and started to burn. At 1am, I realized I was in trouble as I needed the glaze in 3 days. I desparately went on Amazon and found these 6 bottles! I received them the next day, and was so happy, I screamed.This is a great price for an awesome product. I even had 4 bottles left over to use for myself and other jobs.Hurray!You must purchase this balsamic glaze! You will love it like I do!Gabrielle"
5,klein long nose pliers,Im an electrician there is one thing i can say about this tool every electrician must have it its a life saver its worth every penny
3,Good Weapon- if you know how to use it,"The weapon part of the brush is not sharp at all, so to use it as a traditional knife or stabbing implement would be ineffective. But if you are strong and have a basic understanding of human anatomy (where major arteries are located) it can be a life saver. Not the greatest weapon for us women in general, because it takes a lot of strength to stab it into someone, even in their neck, but if you lift weights or have intermediate martial arts training, it will not be difficult to use. I would recommend this item only because i can get it into places that traditional weapons cannot go (places with metal detectors) so i can leave it in my purse at all times, even when i have to testify in court that day, and be secure going home that night. But if you don't need to worry about metal detectors or being stopped by police, just buy a knife, a sharp one, and call it a day."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I got this as a cheap alternative to a dremel back when I was in college.Pros:CheapWorks with most dremel bitsGreat for precision workCons:The cord is cumbersomeThe shape is akward to work with when compared to the dremel.While it works with most dremel bits, it doesn't work with any other dremel attachments (i.e. the router accessory or the ninety degree angle cutter)."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,For the high price of this video I expected a professional production instead of an obviously homemade job with background noise that includes sounds like traffic. Mr. Shapiro is supposed to be a Paine scholar but he's not even sure if Paine was ever married. You'll be embarassed for Mr. Shapiro and his presentation.
4,Movie fan,"The first time I saw this movie was in Canada. I live in the US and wanting to see it again, couldn't find it in the neighborhood. So, the only place to go and get the DVD is Amazon, I thought. I got it, enjoyed it and the delivery was fast enough. I was very pleased. Thank you Amazon."
2,Incomplete,I purchased this book along with the author's King and Pawn book. This book is a little better. It has a fair number of simple problems for students to work on and sample games to go along with it. I agree with the other reviers who claim that a big miss with this book is that in the sample games the author fails to point out in many cases where the errors where make. This lack of important information drags the book down considerably. There are also numerous errors in the book.
3,Not as bad as most of the reviews,"As an 11 year old who owns this book I need to point out, though this book may not be the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to tactics it is not that bad.It does has some good points. It does cover a good number of different types of positions. And, I have only found two mistakes in the positons (it seems some of the other readers have found more - but I am only rated about 700 but have beaten some adults at the chess club in Newark).It is good that it does have some exampel games that go with the positions. But it is also true that there is very little explaining what is going on with those games - this is a major weakness as it doesn't tell me where the player went wrong in the games. I really, really think that a kids book should explain what is happening. I have seen a couple of better books covering problems and tactics for kids and will probably get them when I get some more money. I love chess!"
2,Not pleased with the quality or quantity of the material in it,"This is a very, very basic book on tactics. It is just ok for someone that has just learned how the pieces have moved.I found that there was not enough examples of problems to make this book worth while. There explanations are not very good and not as clear as my other two chess books on tactics and traps in the opening (they all had a lot more material too). I felt that the diagrams were much bigger than they needed to be and that a lot of space was wasted on the pages. I have looked at the McKay Chess Library for Kids and they don't seem to have anything beyond super beginner stuff that is the same style."
2,BUMMER!,"I got this book for my Birthday and must say it does not even begin to compare to my Serawan Tactics book. It does not have enough examples and it doesn't do much to tell you what is going on with what it does have. I like books that tell you move by move what is going on, where mistakes are made on both sides. Often a series of moves are given and you don't know where the other person went wrong because it doesn't tell you.My two star ranking is generous - probably 1.5 if they allowed it."
1,Can Something For Kids Be Better Written On Tactacis?,"I was looking for some thing that would teach me tactics in openings or when I would be at any point of the game. I was very, very disapointed when I found this book didn't explain things very well.Well here I go, one,two, three (I hope you give me a good review for being telling you as a 5th grader about writting a review because I am doing this review because I am in a summer scool class),Number One Thing:It does not tell almost every time were the person who made a mistake made it. I want this so I will not make the same mistake.Number Two Thing:I ran out of things to learn much. I wanted to see more stuff and things. The book is SKIPPY. It doesn't expain WHY!!!!I want a book that TEACHES ME TACTICS, ESPECIALLY WHEN I START A GAME IN THE OPENINGS WHERE TRAPS ARE USED."
1,Got this thing - BIG MISTAKE,"I purchased four books by Random House/David McKay for kids level training: Chess For Juniors, Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors, Chess Kids Book of Tactics and Chess Kids Book of the King and Pawn Ending. The first two are the very best book I have ever seen the last two are the worst two books I have ever seen (ok, so I only own about 150 chess books). [...]Lets get into this! This book has ""oversized diagrams"" to fill in the space for lack of material. This book uses games to go along with the tactical problems set up (good concept if done correctly). The problem here is that as stated by the other reviewers there is very little analysis of where a player went wrong to reach these bad positions - why bother with the games in this case? I agree with another reviewer that this book must have been tossed together in a rush. I would have never got it if I read the other reviews in the first place."
4,Master Of Blues Piano,"Otis Spann was a master of blues piano. In a field dominated by guitars, it is refreshing to hear some true, deep blues being played on the piano. The track ""Sometimes I Wonder"" was worth the price of the CD to me. The other reviews here pointed out that the sound quality is not state of the art. But you have to realize that these recordings were made in the 1960's and I'm sure the producers did the best they could with the source material. Yes a vocal cuts out on one song for a few seconds, but the alternative would be to leave the song of the album and I'd rather hear it somewhat less then perfect then not at all. Otis plays a good variety of slow and fast blues, swing type music, organ and even has his wife joins in on a few songs (she has good voice by the way). I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for good piano blues and definately to any Otis Spann fan."
3,pokerkeno,"The cards are small, they should be bigger. The cards are bad for the eyes because of the size. The game should come with a deck of playing cards. This game is fun for all ages."
1,CHOCK FULL OF GMO'S,"How can the manufacturers, whoever they are, be so proud of this product when it is teeming with MONSANTO'S GMO's corn and soy? These foods are unlabeled and untested, harm the environment and cause food allergies, among other things. They could use organic and feel proud and not add to the guinea pig food experiment going on in this country with these GMO's.GO ORGANIC OR DON'T SHOW UP IN MY KITCHEN!! The Hari Krishnas should be ashamed of themselves!"
3,Love these chips but...,"Am a big fan of these chips when I lived on the west coast but a little disappointed in the amount of damage to the box, as well as a few bags seemed stale."
5,"LAVISH PRODUCTION, GREAT SOUND, SUPERB VOCALS","This a masterpiece, plain and simple. The arrangements by Don Costa are bold and unique, brilliant. Some of Sinatra's most dramatic and powerful vocals are on this album. The production is first rate, the orchestration beautiful. It's easily one of the best albums of popular standards ever recorded. I just wish they would release it in a audiophile format. Let's hope!"
3,Sci-Fi Collection,"Well, it's hard to go wrong with so many movies at such a low cost, or so I thought. The truth is I needn't have bothered. I have only viewed half of the films because it's so laborious to wade through the junk. Most are simply awful movies with appalling video quality, similar to YouTube, and that's bad YouTube. A few of the films were curiously better, almost like broadcast quality, but the majority are just unwatchable junk. Sorry, I would like to say that for a bargain price you can't go wrong, but the fact is these are almost all, unviewable junk. My advice? Slowly build a library of classic sci-fi, albeit at higher prices."
5,solid debut for a leader in Canadian rock,"The cd features cool lyrics, strong musical accompaniment and the almost electric voice of lead singer Matthew Good. As the band has progressed, they have become a powerful force in Canadian music. This disc shows their potential and anyone interested in learning a bit about a band you will definitely be hearing in the future should pick this disc up."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"The Last of the Ghetto Astronauts CD is awesome! This band is by far one of the best ever. Offering a wide range of music, MGB's CD really kicks ass. It is really a must have."
1,Meager,I have read three books on the subject and this was the worst. There is very little info in big type on this books 130 pages. The interview questions are basic and there aren't many of them. All these books are over priced but this one is the worst I have seen.
4,Your Arsenal,"Your Arsenalis being his 1992 release and his third studio album is a very good effort indeed. Tracks that standout are ""Glamorous Glue"", ""The National Front Disco"" and ""we'll let you know"". The booklet is quite dispointing with no lyrics and no information. The photographs are quite bad and look like they were shot with a cheap camera. 4/5."
2,"At best, Morrissey's worst","I find it interesting that this is one of the only Morrissey albums with no lyrics included. It is also one of his weakest albums lyrically. Coincidence? I'm not sure. The lyrics seem rather pointless when compared to some of his other works like ""Viva Hate"" or his later release ""Vauxhall and I"". Musically, it sounded more like general, vapid alt. rock than it did anything else. Songs like ""Tomorrow"" and ""We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful"" are the highlights of the album, but the rest of it seems to fade away with the passage of time. Believe me, if you want vintage Morrissey, I would not recommend this one."
5,Exceptionaly good.,"Morrissey fans rejoice! This album is one of the best made by the Moz. Again, we are shown that no one can make a depressing topic seem more exciting than Morrissey. Overall a great album. A must have!"
4,"Not Quite it, but VERY convenient.","I thought this was pretty decent for an instant gratification type of item. It is a little on the sweet side but I found that adding a little extra water helped quite a bit. I also like that is comes in convenient single servings, so it's easy to just pick-up and go."
4,Handy for travel,"While nothing can beat a real Thai iced tea, this is pretty good. I carry these with me to use while I'm in the cafeteria for convenience. They have a nice creamy texture, and are quite sweet."
1,THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I've never believed the phrase ""looks can be deceiving"" more in my life! If you look at these guys, you see that they resemble guys from a punk band, then you put this in your player and see that this junk is worse than Backstreet Boys! I wouldn't recommend this cd if my life depended on it!"
2,My daughter LOVED this!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas after she turned 4. It had 3 different parts to it that all snap together. She loved it! It was noisy, and there are tiny little parts, and the polly dolls that come with it are so small, they could stand on a fingernail. The track to the rollar coaster comes apart easily and is hard to figure out how to put back together. If you are looking for something fun for you child to play with, this this is it...but only if you are ready to keep track of tiny little dolls and possibly be putting the track back together all of the time."
4,Handy tool,"Works great and gets in tight places. Pretty good torque. Not for heavy and long use. Buying ""gold"" batteries is worth it. If batteries die its still a good screwdriver."
2,VersaPak = VersaJunk. The best thing this could be used for is a CLUB!,"It does work as screw driver, sorta. It's too long to get into a lot of places. The fold over handle doesn't go far enough. And not having a variable speed really sucks. I can get my cordless variable speed drill into just about any place this will go and some that it wont.Don't try to use this to put slot head screws into finished wood. You will end up with gouges from it slipping off of the screw head because it sorta jump-starts when you press the button.The poor quality batteries are a whole other issue since they seem to die and wont take a charge after just a few cycles through the charger, when you can get the charger to work. I now have 4 chargers. 3 double, only one of those still works on one side. And one single charger that quit working after just a few uses.This has now joined the growing collection of ""Things that don't work"" that I have. Along with the VersaPak Scum Buster, and the VersaPak Drill."
5,Great idea!,"These select-a-size paper towels are great for all the quick cleanups that happen in the kitchen and around the house. They are about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a regular paper towel, so you don't waste anything when the cleanup is small. The plain select-a-size towels are available in the stores only sometimes and I've never seen the printed ones in the stores. Ordering from Amazon.com ensures that I get the paper towels I like to use."
1,Cordless drill battery,It was not the right battery for my drill. Cannot use. Need to return for different battery that works right
1,screen freezing up,the display screen freezes up. it happens a lot. got to pull the battery out. then battery gose dead. & got to charge again. then it will happen again on all handsets
2,Very Unsatisfied!,"After thoroughly researching different models and styles, we ordered this one. Unpacked it from the box and set it up. We liked the larger view screen on the handsets, but one of them would not work. Talked to Uniden's support line - VERY UNHELPFUL! Basically, we had to pack the whole thing up and send the whole unit back when all we needed was just one replacement handset. I told them if I had to send the whole thing back, I just wanted a refund and would buy another product!"
2,Uniden DCT758-4,"Somewhat disappointed. After going through the unpacking excercise and installing all batteries etc. Noticed that the antenna on the base unit was broken. Although the antenna is designed to move both horizontally and vertically, the antenna was completed disconntected from the unit. If you intend on using the base unit as a wall mount, make sure that you have ample room to accomodate the antenna and the phone."
3,Herm Sprenger Prong Collar,This is the fixed version of the Prong Collar which mean it can be a hassle to put or remove it from your dog.I would recommend to get the one with the one with the snap lock instead.
3,An American Soldier Under the greek Flag,"First hand account of fighting as an independent U S soldier, without pay, for the Greek army against the Turks. His battle strategies won him great praise by the people of Greece and upon his return to Nashville, the Greek families living there. A true soldier of fortune who began his career fighting with Theodore Roosevelt.A very good military book.he was my great uncle."
4,Does it's job,"Performed just as expected and wanted. Doesn't fill tires nearly as fast as the gas station, but if you count the trip time probably about the same overall elapsed time to fill four tires (assuming they weren't too low to begin with). Gauge might read slightly high - just use a separate gauge."
3,Not for the beginner,The book contains a lot of useful information however it appears that it is not intended for the ameteur but more towards the professional. Most of the demonstrated techniques call for expensive equipment that most people would not have.
4,Post Polio Syndrome,I am not in a position to review the book as it was purchased for a friend experiencing Post Polio Syndrome. My friend did mention that she was reassured that her symptoms were the result of the syndrome and nothing more ominous.
5,Sterilite Corp. 6418006 2Pc White Dish Drainer,I could not locate this item in too many stores and never could find this size. It's a great item and fits on the sink counter perfect. The cost is great also.
3,Great Cable but very short lifetime,I have gone through 3 of them now. The lifetime of the cable is about 6 month to 1 year.But I have to agree the sound quality is super. I can not stand the other ones after using this one.
3,"Cable ok, shell too large.","Works fine in my iPod, however, the cable case is too large to fit into the recessed socket on my iPhone."
1,Handles poorly,The unit pictured probably works ok. The 11045 I have has thicker handles and will not fit into the stripper pocket on Klein toolbelts. You would think the tool and pouch departments would get together! My stripper therefore falls out several times a day and I pray for the day it is gone for good. Teaches me a lesson....always stay with Ideal....especially for strippers. I contacted Klein...which I have done about 3 times over the years. Same as usual....they do not respond to emails. This company is worth passing by. I've been a master electrician for about 25 years. I wish Klein would stick to pro tools and wouldn't worry about pretty colors.
4,Tiny. Loud. Awesome.,"A pocket sized blast of loudness. Just what everyone needs. Probably won't last longer than 20 or so toots, but what do you expect for the size?"
3,Dont look for much VB code in this book,"The set is well organized and it covers a multitude of information. But, the case cover is misleading, this book contains little if any VB code even though the book requirements state that the toolkit for VB is required (you cant read the books because this kit is shrinkwrapped). Stay away VB programmers,its a waste, go get larry roof's book instead."
4,"A cautious read, but worth it","I actually had to read this book for a class but was mildly surprised with what Mazur has to offer. This book begins just as the back cover description goes, with a woman finding a strange man bathing in her washtub. An odd beginning for an outstandingly odd story. While it seems to border at times with the fringes of a bad soap opera, this story manages to capture the reality of a strikingly different life situation. It gives further focus to the human condition of finding boundaries and giving definition to overlapping human relationships."
4,The Need to Know How Others Work,"It should be obvious - but too often isn't that we writers become acquainted with the work of our colleagues. Susan Perry has pulled back the curtain, taken us behind the scenes and into the lives of successful authors. We will find some strange and new ways of creating words and we will also nod in recognition when we discover a writer whose work patterns we relate to. In either case, the knowledge gives us power and hope and inspiration. The authors who shared their angst and elation , their failures, rejections and finally successes in ""Writing in Flow"" make us realize that they too (as we do) have those highs and lows. So finally, we learn, it's talent and persistence, and yes luck that gets us published. So, hats off to Susan for doing all the research and interviews.Frances Halpern/ Host of Connections which airs at 10 a.m. Sunday (moving to 3 p.m. Saturday beginning April 14) at KCLU, an NPR affiliate located in Thousand Oaks, California."
3,Couldn't get into the flow,"This is a well-researched and well-written book. The author has done an excellent job of collecting data from writers on how they manage to get into the flow of writing. But I found it to be just that, an interesting collection of data rather than an inspiring work that would help get me, another writer, into the flow of creation."
4,excellent product that needs more accessories,"The cobra throne is an awesome accessory, as well as the flags. The only thing that would have made this set better would have been the inclusion of more weapons for the imperial guards."
5,I bet you can't just read just one page and put it down!,"From cover to the last page I found that my 6 year old friend could not put this book down. The illustrations will make adults long for quality books for our children. The text though written in 1939 is fitting for todays adventure seeking youth and it is truely a book for the 4 to 8 or 4 to 80 age group.Being a Master Captain, I had a natural likeness for such a seafaring book but the relationship and transformation that occurs in Captain Slaughterboard because of a warm little fruit eating creature found on a pink Island is a lesson for land lubbers and cattle ranchers as well as those with seafaring interests. I had to buy a copy for my own collection. The illustrations of this book are pure art and nothing less.You have to buy this 1939 classic no matter what age you are and if you don't like it I will buy it.Capt. Steve Olsen"
2,charlie 21,this song needs a slammin mix by david morales 10 minute long with plenty of low frequency bass response. Morales is of the quality that would have been played at Studio 54 and Area NYC and Club A Have Pussycat Dolls give extra voice over loops to add new tracks will equate to $$$$$ Another example of where if you want it done right you have to do it yourself
3,I got the wrong game in the mail,"I don't know why I'm rating this since the person who was suppose to send this to me sent me the nintendo version of this instead of the sega genesis version that I wanted. So yeahhhhhh.....pretty sure you have to use a light gun for this game...instead of a regular controller, since it's basically like the arcade game. Word."
1,Why is this allowed to be sold?,I bought this from a Science museum in Melbourne. My son was so excited to get home and try it out. What a disappointment! It does walk up windows at all. Definitely not worth buying.
5,Awesome,I love the headset. Have used many other varieties of single ear-piece sets. THis is far better and well worth the investment.
4,I love my little drill . . .,"My father gave me an 7.2V VersaPak drill as part of a tool kit he put together for me one Christmas (previous model.) I LOVE the drill. It is lightweight and perfect for light-duty household projects. I know this drill has power limitations, after all it is only 7.2V. But who really wants to wield a 10 pound drill to hang a closet kit or curtain rod?However, if you choose this drill or any other VeraPak tool, buy the VersaPak Gold batteries. The regular VersaPak batteries are a waste of time. They drain quickly when in use or just sitting and have a terrible memory problem. The Gold ones don't seem to have that problem.I checked the Black and Decker website and it looks as if the VersaPak drill has been updated again. Hopefully, it will be available again soon. If mine ever dies or ""walks off"" I will certainly want a replacement for it."
1,The marketeer's yoga book ?,"Do not get fool by the title. There is absolutely nothing new on this book except the title which is aiming to take advantage of runners who may think this book can give us that extra edge in improving our skill.If indeed any one of our fellow runners who are interested in yoga, check out the book of ""Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class"" instead. It outlines very clear pose by pose, classroom teaching, lecture type of instruction."
1,TERRIBLE Review Book!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I am a student in a very rigorous AP/IB program (this year I took 9 AP and IB exams combined.) I can say with no hesitation that out of all the books I have used to review my respective subjects this is the absolute worst. The entire book is written as if you should already know everything by taking the class. Due to that fact, why not just use your own class notes? I'm sure that they will be of higher quality, and more suited to review the appropriate material than this sorry excuse for a review book. It is very hard to find a page in this book that does not have significant grammatical errors, but also in which the author does not pose at least 5 rhetorical questions; I'm sorry but when I paid my 20 dollars for this book I didn't realize comedy and lack of information would be the return on my investment. I would recommend the other review book on this subject without even having seen it."
2,not enough info,"the review is very vague, important vocabulary is not highlighted, just a sort of rambling by the author that reviews random parts of what you need to know. also the author says things like ""you should have learned about this in your textbook and if you don't remember go back and look in your textbook"" a lot which really defeats the purpose of a review book. i think this can only be helpful if you REALLY know your stuff and just need a very light review but in that case you probably don't even need this book. also i don't like that there are no multiple choice questions at the end of every section. at the end of every section there is a review that consists of a paragraph or two with blanks that you have to fill in with arbitrary words."
1,Not true 1/4 sheet,"These are 4.5"" square sheets....which is NOT 1/4 of a 9.5x11 sheet according to my math. Very disappointed because they seemed to be good quality."
4,Best harmonies of all the British Invasion bands...,"This is a very extensive collection...3 CD's...57 tracks...every A & B side...& 5 previously unreleased songs. Their early years were way too close to the Beatles for comfort but once they found their identity, they created some great songs. For my taste, an edited down double CD would have been better, especially without the 4 lame songs from the `90s including a lounge like cover of Purple Rain. Surprisingly, this is the first Hollies album I have ever owned. Interestingly, when lead singer Allan Clarke left for a solo career, their very next song was their biggest US hit, Long Cool Woman. Everyone should at least own their greatest hits because they probably had the best harmonies (along with The Beatles) of all the British Invasion bands."
1,Very unhappy with the purchase,"Purchased a PS130 replacement for my old battery but the ""new"" batery is actually worse than my original 5 yrs old battery. Went through several cycles of complete discharge then charge with no effect whatsoever."
5,rechargeable battery,My old rechargeable battery for my cordless drill died. I debated whether to replace the battery or buy a new drill. The replacement battery works great. I am glad that I choose to replace the battery not the entire drill.
1,wrong item,I need to return the battery ..it is the wrong one. I need the slide battery and have ardered it. What do I need to do to return it?
4,Replacement battery,"Although one can buy a new drill for only a little bit more than the cost of the replacement battery, you do save a little . . . and put less stuff in the landfill."
3,Artsy fartsy,"I got this one just to add to the vast collection of books I have. It's okay, has paintings and is kinda abstract. Nothing that new about our favorite hothead."
1,Lousy Parts Availability,"This is a throw away tool. When it quits, it can't be fixed.Last week, a few months into ownership, nothing happened when I tried to use it. Batteries are good, so that narrowed it down to a switch or motor.I am told by B&D; that neither the motor nor the switch is available.I blame the product for failing and I blame Black and Decker for not supporting the product with replacement parts.Never again. I have bought my last Black and Decker product."
1,multi-purpose saw,This saw description makes you think you can do things that it is not up to doing. We returned ours. Only good for balsa wood or any very light weight material. I cannot rate it because I was disappointed in its performance.
4,A strange encounter... but fun none-the-less...,"I first encountered this game, after ordering the Sega Channel through Paragon Cable (now comcast). Since it's conception, I would play it randomly and exceedingly well, until I beat it at least 10 times. After the Sega Channel was discontinued. I decided it was one of the games I MUST have, and decided to buy it, a good buy too (at $2.00 used) at a local game store. I still have the cardridge and its case and manual, a good buy for entertainment and loads of laughs. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!!!"
2,Don't believe the hype!,"What can I say . . . I really like Harvey. I really like the Canton Spirituals & have one of their DVD's. I even have this album but, I didn't really get into this one. When I watched it initially I skipped through it to the songs that I wanted to hear & I haven't watched it since then. I really didn't like the commentary between the songs nor all of the ""acting"" on stage during the songs. I wanted to feel as though I was at the show & I didn't. I really only like watching him sing Grateful & that is about it. Anybody want to buy this back from me?"
5,"Taste great, work great","I've been eating these before my sports practices and during tournaments, and they've served me well. Chocolate and apple are delicious."
2,Really disappointing,"I purchased a box of these after reading the 5 star rave reviews. Sorry, but these remind me of the first generation Powerbars. You have to chew them so much your jaw aches. I will not buy them again. The taste is tolerable. If you want a good tasting and good texture energy bar, try Clif bars."
3,Aviation And the Role of Government,Great info on the history of aviation. Fast easy reading but not much on leglislation. The price of this book is criminal.
4,Great info!,My daughter has been working hard this year on growing herbs. This book was very helpful!
5,herbs,love all books on herbs would like to be able to grow and dry them to sell. love getting a bargain on books thanks for being a great place to come to.
2,Poorly edited,"Numerous typos, very poorly edited, especially the introduction, which is also, generally speaking, poorly written. Other than this, Baudrillard's essay makes its point, the same point we learn from Derrida, albeit indirectly, namely, that the weapons of the bourgeois mind are really only useful against the bourgeois mind."
4,Act of God,This is not a book for anyone who reads the last page first.The last page is a huge surprise! Very suspenseful.
5,Changed the way I thought about improv,"While Truth In Comedy is certainly not your usual ""how to"" book, the essential task this book accomplishes is revolutionizing how you view improvisation. Some may call the book a tad pretentious in terms of its wording and how many times the names of famous I.O alumni are dropped, but at is core, the book truly will change the way you think about a scene. Taking a truly philosophical approach, Truth in Comedy manages to integrate helpful tips with concise and essay like paragraphs on the nature of improv. If you take the time to really think about what Close says in the book, the tips don't feel like tips but instead become the natural thing to do. As a bit of a strange follow up to this book I read The Art of Dramatic Writing. Anyone truly interested in the nature of improvisation should read about and then compare. The connections will be easy to follow once you have read both books and will change the way you think of the term moment to moment."
5,excellent information and material,"I teach an afterschool class to elementary students and I loved this book. It has so much information I can share with the kids. In my class we make a healthy snack together and talk about why it is healthy for us. This book helped me create my curriculum and put together recipes. The students (primary and intermediate grades) really enjoy my class because of it. I highly recommend this book, especially because Connie Evers is a Registered Dietitian. The knowledge she shares is superior to any other book I have read. I also highly recommend her workbook as well as her website. Great references and information for anyone interested in children's nutrition!!!"
5,What kids really need!!!,"Connie Liakos Evers really knows what kids out there need. This bood is written for the adults. I wish we could enable people, kids, teens. adults, to choose balanced meal food items from menus and help people to picture balanced meals and make their choices easier at school or work cafeterias, restaurants, food services of all kinds. There's alot of responsibility in consuming food these days."
3,Hedge trimmer battery,"I use the Black & Decker PS140 14.4 volt nicad battery for a hedge trimmer, and bought a new one because the old one wouldnt hold much of a charge. The new one isnt much better. Very disappointing. Guess that's why these types of batteries have been left behind by the lithium batteries."
2,14.4 volt Battery for B&D Hedge clipper,"Sorry to say , the battery would not take a charge and I was too busy to return it. Not your fault, it's mine for not returning it. Had the return infor somewhere.Thanks for being concerned, good business. Always happy with other purchases."
4,Batteries,The price was reasonable and the product arrived in a timely manor. The batteries charged ok and worked well. Thanks
3,"For J. Jackson ""climaction""","Buy a Dewalt charger like the DW9116. You can find them for $21 on Amazon.com, and they charge the B&D 12v and 14.4 v batteries just fine!"
2,great tools -- bad charger,"I won't go into great detail since others have already stated my problem, but the point is well taken that a cordless tool is only as good as the charger. My charger died and finding a replacement seems impossible. I'll stay away from Black and Decker tools in the future for this reason.UPDATE -- I took the advice of one of the other reviewers, bought a new B&D; charger at a reasonable price, and had that charger go bad within weeks of my purchase. Never again!"
2,What a bummer...,Bought 2 new batteries for my Firestorm setup - stuck the first one in the charger and next morning it was melted and unusable. DON'T leave you batteries in the charger for extended periods...which basically means you'll end up with dead batteries all the time. Crap.
3,14.4 V battery Pack for a Cordless B&D Drill,The battery was shipped quickly. The battery charged without a problem and is working fine.
4,B&D 14.4 V used on DeWalt Drill,"Rather than pay $50-$70 for a DeWalt battery, I have used the Black and Decker Firestorm battery and it works just fine. I have a DeWalt charger and do not leave on the charger after the battery is charged. They will last several years and perform as well as the DeWalt battery."
5,Satisfaction with product,We have enjoyed our Black and Decker Firestorm tool kit. The batteries lasted over three years before needing replaced. The battery charger needed replaced after two years. This all purpose tool set has received a lot of use. We have no complaint about this product.
3,I wouldn't recommend,"While the writing was crisp and easy, the story just had me hating the book.While cliques are very real for girls of this age set, the author makes the reader feel that cliques are the only way to make it through school. That you can't be an individual and still be cool. Girls of this age have enough insecurities without having to try to fit in with the ""in"" crowd and this book promotes the ""in"" crowd and trying to get in it. I think it could have been done in a different light to provide a better outlook."
2,Predicable and overdone...,"This is gossip girl for the younger set. Although I did enjoy the idea of writing from the point of view of a rich girl at first, it gets to be a bit tiresome. I read this book in one evening and got no satisfaction out of it at all. Perhaps a good gift for younger girls (maybe 6th or 7th grade) but not an entertaining read for anyone older. Almost identical plot to ""Mean Girls"" (which i enjoyed) but the characters dont have as much depth and are nowhere near as funny as those in the movie. Happy book hunting!"
4,The Clique,"The Clique illustrates the luxurious lives of upper-class, bitchy young girls who are obsessed with fashion, gossip, and what's ""in."" If you're looking for intellectual reading, this isn't it. That's what English class is for. But this series is absolutely perfect for some mindless reading on Saturday mornings. It may not be realistic, but if it was, it wouldn't be half the fun. Following the lives of shallow, spoiled middle-schoolers isn't everyone's cup of tea, but to some, it's amusing just to see what goes on in the lives of these girls through a book written in easy-to-understand teen language. If you're a teenage girl into fashion and gossip, you'll love this series."
5,5 Stars,"I think that the Clique was an awesome book, and I really enjoyed reading it. I think that everyone can relate to some aspect of the story, and that makes it intriguing. I suppose that the book goes a tad heavy with the label/designer-dropping, but that's the kind of book I like, so I wasn't bothered by it. I'd recommend it to anyone who's into gossip-y, fashion books."
1,UGHH,"When first hearing about this bbook i was excited, but then after ordering it, to my disapointment it was horrible! it seems as though the author is trying to write a book that in some ways are like gossip girl, alist etc etc but failed. With the story about seventh graders, come on we've all been in seventh grade, what REALLY happens in 7th grade thats so interesting"
4,The Clique,"This book, was by far the best. Its an extremely good book for those teens who don't like to read. It's about 4 rich girls who are set in their ways, with Louis Vuitton Bags, Burberry, and all sorts of other things. When a new girl comes to this town, she tries to fit in with the most popular girl in school, Massie. The new girl is poor and doesn't fit in well. Not one of Massie's friends want to hang out with a loser. Then the new girl manipulates Massie's friends and Massie is left standing in the rain by herself. Read to find out what's next,I recommend this book. Four Stars ****"
1,"The Clique, by Lisa Harrison PARENTS READ THIS REVIEW","The Clique is a pretty bad book. I read it and honesty--it's makes you feel pretty sad. For one, it takes place in Westchester. Everyone there is snotty, mean and dead rich.You feel like you aren't lucky. You're not good enough. Everyone there has beautiful mansions, chauffers, cooks, maids, hundreds of shoes, clothes, and so on. You feel like you have NOTHING. You are useless.The main character is Massie. She has EVERYTHING. Computer, cell phone, palm pilot, t.v., lots and lots of desinger clothes, and much more. She's in a clique where the girls are mean. They buy her a $700 and something shirt just because she lied to them about becoming sick.Then some poor girl comes and they hate her fashion sense. So they talk behind her back and do a lot more terrible things to her.This book really makes you feel sad, bad, greedy, depressed and not good. There is a small bit of swearing in this book, as well.Please consider this review."
5,EHMAGAWD!,These books are the best books that I have ever read. They are ah-mazing. I can't put them down. I could read these books all day. They are very funny and Massie Block so interesting. These will always be my favorite books. I heart them!
4,Fun,"I read this book for a project in class, and i loved it, it was a really awesome book, now sorry but i gotta go off topic for a sec, that girl that said she was rich and stuff, doesnt really sound all that rich, i am semi wealthy,not to brag, and all the kids at my school that are rich dont brag about it and say oh yes louis vuitton is the best! and oh yes marc jacobs! we just act normal, sure i own a few nice things but never louis vuitton, that is just ugly and tacky, not 7 jeans mostly true religion or abercrombie, and whatever else, im not going to go all out and say how my day is like that other girl did, but whatever."
5,"Funny, Light-hearted and Entertaining Series","I am an adult with a weakness for reading children's literature and I have to say that I really love this series. There are always references to designer clothes and rich lifestyles and it is a guilty pleasure to read about this. I do admit that it is rather shallow but don't take it seriously and just read it as light-hearted entertainment. Also, there is no sex and no swearing and would be completely appropriate for ages 12 and up."
4,Godd and Bad things=Great,"This book is ""ah-mazing"" as the girls say in The Clique. It's simialar to Mean Girls but with problems that everyday girls can relate to. Sure it mentions a lot of brand name and the girls do some mean stuff but if you look past all the superficial items and attitudes the girls are just like average Americans but they are rich. I think that only older age girls in at least the 6th grade should read this book because it can be a little too advanced and cruel for anyone younger than that. Overall though no book is perfect so the good and bad things make this book great."
5,good,"The reviews I have seen are all liking the series. However I do see some that say how it's bad. I do disagree with those. This story is for enjoyment. I think Lisi is an excellent writer, and these characters are portrayed as fictional, and I think people who are taking them as serious characters are taking the story wrong. Really this story as for enjoyment, and I do enjoy reading them and seeing what's going to happen next."
1,this book was soooo stupid!,"basicly this book was about girls who only care about money, clothes, and popularity. they're all into just being mean to the girls that are ""uncool"". and they claim to be ""true friends"". please. if you want a book about real friendship, check out The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series."
5,Just what I was looking for,"We have a box of old slides from my in-laws, and have never looked at any of them. We did not want to get a slide projector, just wanted to get a better look at what the photos were. This is a simple, inexpensive way to sort these slides. I am also interested in trying the trick that someone mentioned whereby I could take photos of the slides with my digital camera using this device. Haven't tried it yet, but might come in handy. Anyway, very happy with this little gadget."
3,Its OK,"This item is easy to use and is OK if all you want to do is sort slides. This viewer has certain drawbacks such as needing light to view slides you need a strong light you can get an acceptable view of the picture. Next, the size of this viewer only ailows you to view the slide in the same size as the slide itself, making details difficult to see."
2,simple viewer,"This is a very simple to use viewer, just what I wanted for the quick project I had. The only major problem is that it doesn't have a light built in, which means you have to have a light available, easy to use. Since this was to be used only for one project, it did the job."
5,"Small, but Nice","This item is quite small, but it is perfect for my daunting job of sorting through hundreds of 35mm slides!"
3,"Good, but lacking power","I love the size of this tool, purchased it since it's small and easy to store being an person who lives in an apt. I used it to try cutting some 3/4 inch wood for making shelfs in one of my closets. It's small and easy to guide, but lacks in the power dept. Had only cut a few boards when it gave up the juice and had to recharge overnight, tried again the next day. Same thing. Get a second set of batteries and perferably the gold ones, I hear they are alot better than the sliver oneswhich I purchase a second set of."
5,great mount,"makes access to the unit much easier. Bonds well with the dash I am using the temporary pad and it works fine, just clean the dash with rubbing alcohol first. Buy two, makes moving between two vehicles much easier."
3,Adhesive never stuck,"I tried everything, permanent and temporary to get the base to stick. Nothing works.I finally got a adhesive from Radio Shack and it is working fine.The actual unit works great when the base is mounted.I rated it 3 stars since the unit is functional but the adhesive is useless."
5,love it,this item is perfect for little spaced area's.its light weight easy to mount with the two sided tape & strong.recommend this product who have problems with the sucction cup mount.
1,Adhesive didn't stick to anything.,"Instructions said the adhesive is ""permanent"" - but it was only mildly sticky and didn't adhere to my dashboard. Contacted Garmin who were very quick to reply and theorized that there was too much of a curve in my dashboard and recommended the friction mount. I will not guess on whether the problem was debugged correctly or not, but high praise to Garmin for being responsive to a small problem quickly - but I cannot recommend this product simply because of the risk of one having the same experience I did. Not sure I can return it, that is my next project."
2,Not Great,I bought this game hoping for a fun old school fighting game for the genesis. I was a bit let down by this one. I wish it had more playable characters and also more options outside of the one player tournament mode. With that said I am not really a huge fan of the fighting game genre. I like RPG's and Strategy games. My opinion may be a little biased against games like this.
1,ronlin69,THIS WAS SENT BACK IMMEDIATELY. THE SITE DID NOT SAY THAT IT WAS A CASSETTE. WHO LISTENS TO THOSE ANYMORE?
2,Does not fit right,"I do not recommend this for the 2008 Mustang. It does not fit flush to the side of the car. The right side sinks in. I am looking for spacers to bring it out to sit flush. I have seen others that sit flush but this one does not. I would like to contact the seller but they have no contact information. Another reason I do not recommend it.It is nice quality and looks good but should fit better, for a clean look."
3,Been better if complete,"This soundtrack contains the fast paced techno beat that is heard on occasion within the Lain Anime. Overall it is good and lots of fun to listen too. The music isn't to harsh even though it retains a very good techno edge to it.The biggest problem with this soundtrack is that it is missing two tracks that are found on the Import version, and those two tracks are the whole reason I wanted the CD to begin with, the rest of the music is really just nice to have but not great. For this reason I docked it a star.FYI - The two tracks that are missing are Duvet Ciberia Mix and Duvet TV Sized - the latter track is the music that is used in the shows intro."
3,Great birthday gift,"This was a birthday gift for a four year old girl. She loved it and it has given her lots of ""imaginative"" playtime."
4,couldnt be better!,"i had no clue what songs were on this CD when i bought it. i didnt realize they're songs are all over (crazy taxi 1&2). they have some really catchy sons in this CD lke ""origional prankster"" and ""living in chaos"" which arent like any of theyre other songs but more of rap/rock. this CD isnt as good as they're others (smash, ignition, ECT.) but still is very good."
1,The Downword Spiral Continues,"What a dissapointment. I'm a big Offspring fan but I'm not into this new sound at all. I could tolerate Americana, but this is no good. The band got way too poppy. The only good songs on it are Want You Bad and Million Miles Away because they have a little bit of their old-school feel. If you like stuff like Sum 41, Blink 182 and Wheetus then you'll probably like this. But if you're into real punk music like the band's early days, don't buy this."
1,A Record That Doesn't Come Out Swinging,"I have liked the Offspring's music, whether the song was ""Self-Esteem"", ""Come Out And Play"" or ""Kick Him When He's Down"". But this CD has the band facing a path of becoming rock sellouts, the path Green Day and blink-182 took. This isn't Offspring anymore. This is trash. Listen to ""Want You Bad"". Sounds a lot like what Simple Plan would write. Do you follow? Stick with the Offspring's first four releases. ""Americana"" and ""Splinter"" suck as well."
2,What The...,"Geez! ever heard the word ripoff? Obviosly these guys are getting weaker every album. This thing should be 2-3 bucks. It's terrible! theirs only a few songs that are good, and 2 are bonus tracks I got from Best buy! It's okay, i don't think i could live without it, but it is really weak. you can hear the age in their voices."
4,conspiracy of one,"the record plays very good, however there is a bend in the vinyl but as far as i'm concirned this doesn't affect the playing of it. the inner sleeve shows damage to three sides wich i regret.all that being said it's a fine record and i'm happy with it !"
3,Good dose of punk rock,"The Offspring's latest album has the usual crafty hooks and poppy melodies, but never really get into any new grounds. The lowpoints of the album are Original prankster, a stupid rap/rock song that couldn't be any more unipropriate, and the over ordinary tracks All Alon and Conspiracy of One. But when The Offspring are good on this album, they're right on the money with smart and intelligent lyrics, from songs like Want You Bad (the most punkish song) and One Fine Day. They also experiment a bit with the bubble gummy guitars on Living in Chaos and nice little drum beats and squeeky sound effects/ooga chaka clips on Special Delivery. But the best song on Conspiracy of One is definetely Denial Revisited with the crisp guitar work, little drum licks,jammin bass and Dexter Holland's voice bursting with energy, few singers create. Overall, Conspiracy of One should be a nice addition to anyone's cd collection."
5,Wonderful game,"I was introduced to this game recently and had to order a copy that very night. This game plays well for 2 to 7 players (we even stretched it to 8). It's easy to learn, and you feel a sense of accomplishment even when you don't win. Bartering, trading, and donating cards can get funny with bigger groups, and how cut-throat you want to be is totally up to your group's style. Kids would easily get this game, while adults can really get into the strategy and trading portions of this game. A ""must own"" for your collection!"
5,Our Family's Favorite Game,"This is an AWESOME game--you are never waiting for your turn. The strategy for the game is bean, planting, trading & harvesting. The one with the most coins (from the harvest) at the end wins. No score to keep. Provides lots of lively trading, giving, and bartering. Each time our family is together inevitably we pull out the *beans* game--provides tons of fun. Naturally, we have our own ""house rules"" which makes it even more fun. Highly recommend."
4,Bean planting with a strategy,"This game was first introduced to me by a friend. At first, the idea of bean planting was silly, but as you start playing and getting into the game, it's actually really fun! You soon realize that it takes strategy to gain more money so you can lead. It was so fun that I decided to buy my own set."
3,Better than Settlers?,"Is it better than Uno? Yes. Is it better than Settlers? No. It is faster than Settlers. It will only take you about 5 minutes to explain the game to someone. Those are good things. Will most people like this game? Probably. This is a light strategy card game. By startegy I mean you do have to put some thought into your decisions. Howevr, the dinger is that there is a huge luck factor in this game. If you are ok with that, then this is a great game. the player interaction alone is worth the price of admission.Bottom Line: Is this game fun? Fun in that it has high player interaction and is easy to understand. But poor in terms of strategy and skill. Will ADD gamers like it? Definately. Will Eurogamers like it? At first, but they will fade fairly quickly. This is a light long filler game."
4,Fun game,"My family, including 11 year old daughter, enjoy this game very much. We don't like the two person version and even three people is a little boring. Four or more though is lots of fun."
5,One of the Best Starter Books,"By far a really, really good starter book for anyone looking to see what it would take to get into restoring a classic car. If you know the basics; budgeting, tools needed, what car to look for this is not the book for you.But for those who haven't even scoped the project this is a great starting point to layout your plan of how you are going to proceed or whether your should proceed at all."
4,This was Steppenwolfs great live album.,This is the first band together for a live and powerful album. It's where they show the world in 1968 what they beleive in. The song's tell the truth and put out an important message to everyone. This was steppenwolf at it's finist live recording. Raw real and powerful.
2,"I Hate to naysay...but,","Well, what more can I say? Being a fan of real hip-hop, rap, and being a real avid music lover this album gets a 2 star vote. Generally, there is about half of the album that is cool, the other half seems to be really wack. Frontin of course is the best song. Period.Busta Ryhmes- Wack beat, wack rhyme.Fam-Lay - Hot, he is coming into his own.Clipe - Hot, new group...good effort.Kelis and Nas - Come on, that song is older than dirt. This is a filler track, but cool song. Iw ould expect better, new material from the Neptunes.The rest, well...draw your own conclusion, I would rather download this album or burn it that buy it. Artists complain about downloading, but hey make better albums that do not suck! We have way too many artists that have one hot song, then the rest of the album is a rip-off. Work for my money!"
2,Pop Compilation,"If your expecting N.E.R.D., then this album isn't the one for you. Although it has one track (Loser)by N.E.R.D., but it isn't quite to par as to their previous release ""In Search Of.."". This seems to be more of a compilation CD for their up-coming projects in the future. You can still find those spacey synths and hard drums in their solid beats, but it's the same redundant sound that they seem to live off of. Not particularly their best work. This is more for those pop heads looking for the basic mainstream sound."
4,Neptunes present : Beats that make your spine tingle!,"If you want to listen to crazy, original sounding beats, buy the album! My favourite choice of beats is the 3rd track called ""Blaze of glory"". The DVD included is also very good considering it comes free with the cd. The dvd consists of 3 music videos along with a 24 minute documentary on the neptunes!boom boom boom...BING! Buy the cd!"
1,1989 - 1995: May the Golden Era of Hip Hop RIP!,"These two ""producers"" are one of the reasons most hip hop is junk these days. Do yourself a favor and pick up Gangstarr's ""Ownerz"" instead. Leave this junk to the TRL kids."
5,"Production 5 stars, Lyrics 3 stars.","If you're lookin for a good CD to play in you ride this is for you. Other than that, don't look to deep into this. Its great commercial-wise. The production was dope but the lyrical content is average at best. Its worth the purchase if ya want to hear some of the more popular artists on some cool tracks, but don't take it too seriously. Peace"
3,Pay Attention!,"Get it right people, The Neptunes (Hugo and Williams) are producers hence Neptunes presents. N.E.R.D. is a rock group with Hugo and Williams and another dude. They are not one and the same they are very different: Working with other artists, they give them what they think they want, whether they are 100% on it or not. They bring out new talent like Fam-Lay out of VA and make money producing Other Artists.This is the reason a N.E.R.D album is coming out very soon, they keep their job and their own personal music separate. Pay attention, please!The artists on 'Presents' are ok. Im not a big fan of most of them but overall the production values are tight as usual and smooth."
3,Sorry.....,"I normally dont like to give bad reviews but i had to write something for this cd. I will start with the good points of this cd. Alot of the songs are tight, and we all know that the neptunes are great producers. Ok now for the bad part, pharrell cant sing. I dont understand why he even choose to sing on this cd, he and chad are great producers and should stick with that. I havnt heard chad sing so i dont know if he can. Also of all the songs that they have produced why these songs? I dont know, overall if they switched a few songs, and got pharrell to stop singing it would be a good cd."
4,Great Package value with 3 different media options,This is not typically a movie I would buy on Blu-ray however with the DVD copy and the digital copy this made it a great value. the digital copy is in my I-Tunes library and moved easily to my I-touch. It is nice to have kids movies for my granddaughter to watch on car trips and such.I had low expectations for this movie to begin with but was pleasantly surprised so after first renting I bought this Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy. This was an entertaining movie (a bit on the sappy) for both adults and children.
4,good movie,"The tooth fairy adds somethings to a sports movie, the kids loved it and so did the whole family. Who would think a hockey player collecting teeth."
2,Wow... How horrid,"This was really an awful movie. The entire first half was about The Rock being a jerk. The second half of the movie went back and forth between Rock the Jerk and Rock the Nice Guy, which was simply not believable. The plot made little to no sense. The acting was awful. I suggest just watching the last 15 minutes, and you can get the jist of the entire movie. SKIP IF YOU CAN."
1,Worst movie ever?,"Ok, Julie Andrews was in this movie - so I can't in good consciousness proclaim it to be the worst movie ever made - but I'm trying hard to see if there are any other redeeming values. Nope, can't think of any. Even my kids were embarrased by how bad it was, and they are pretty easy to please. (ok, to be fair, there were some funny lines ... but certainly not enough to carry this dog to bed.)"
5,Perfecf.,What I expect. In perfect conditions. Recived at time. Basic for your collection.Recommended for all who wants to learn the basis of fluids.
5,Zombies Ate MY Neighbors,I played this as a kid but for some reason the game never starts the first time i put it in. It takes a second time for me to be able to play the game every time i insert it into my system. it's the only game that i have that does that.
4,"Good, It gets hard and frustrating along the way",After the mine cart level the levels are REALLY hard. It's fun but frustrating. It took me a hole day to beat one half of a level.
4,Manoman is this fun!!!!!,"I thought this game will be a bestseller for nintendo. Even though I'm a beginner at this, I've got to say that this is one heck of a game. The graphics are superb, control is most excellent, and music is just radical!When I first got this game I was pretty doubtful about its content. So to all the kids looking for this game I'm gonna give ratings.Control: 4/5Gameplay: 5/5Sound: 5/5Overall: 10/5!!So fellow game players, with this, I say to you: GOOD GAMEPLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good game,"Donkey Kong Country is a pretty good game, pretty much exactly like the original version but with a couple things added. Nice for on the go (obviously since it's handheld)! If you've played the original and liked it, then you'll like this. If you haven't played the original, then this'd be a good way to, like I said it's pretty much exactly the same. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Donkey kong needs help!,I really do not like this game at all!I think the graphics are bad and the game is boring.If you are going to make #2 make sure you improve it!
5,Classic game as good as ever,This is a great game and very hard to find now. The story line is you are going to regain the banana hoard that Kremlin took. The levels are difficult yet fun and the grafics are very pleasing. The fun music and bad guys make it on the level of Mario. The key feature is that you have two characters that can switch or if one dies the other will continue the mission alone.
3,donkey kong country,the last level of this game is one of the most annoying levels in any game i have ever played. i just needed to say that
3,Decent Book,"My item arrived in a fair amount of time and the book is decent. It is broken up in to different categories and some words are repeated in more than 1 section, but with alternate meanings. Not bad at all . . ."
5,The Complete Works of Lao Tzu: Tao Teh Ching & Hua Hu Ching,"The Tao Teh Ching is one of the most frequently translated and most cherished works in the world. This is an ancient Chinese classic, and while written around 500 B.C., it provides a very practical guideline for natural and harmonious living, even today. This particular translation by Hua-Ching N, called The Complete Works of Lao Tzualso includes one of the only written translations of the Hua Hu Ching. I quote Lao Tzu in the ""Enjoy the Journey"" chapter of my book and audio book,Managing Thought: How Do Your Thoughts Rule Your World?Each reading offers timeless teachings that have helped me to focus on what truly matters to me and to enjoy a life well-lived."
5,Long-term memory says it was brilliant,"I read this 4 years ago, when touring Ireland (when abroad, i always get a random book by a local author), and it's the best pot-luck book purchase i've ever made. Humour, compassion, and all the things that left me with a strong impression of a great book, this long afer. On the strngth of it, i'm buying up all his titles."
5,Fabulous Historical Eroticism,"This is the absolute best erotic book I've ever read.It has just the right style of subtle, sophisticated arousal."
4,Excellent for frequent online sellers,"I've been selling on eBay a while and these mailers are perfect for that. Sturdy, well-padded and reliable. Out of the carton that I bought, only one was a problem having had a separated seam that I was able to fix using packing tape. Excellent deal to keep costs down."
2,Different and not in a good way,If you like Bohnanza this is not the same game. The board and components are good quality. Some of the game mechanics remind me of Bohnanza but it just isn't very fun. The interaction and trading just isn't the same. Ends up just being a pick up and deliver game that isn't all that interesting.
5,"Great seeds, high germination rate","As anyone with experience will tell you, Rosemary has a notoriously low germination rate. I had read good things about these seeds online, however, and decided to give them a shot. Of the 32 seeds I planted, about 20 or so sprouted. FAR higher than the 6 I was expecting!One thing to note, although this says 150 seeds, I received somewhere between 50 and 75. Regardless though, with the significantly higher germination rate, I am extremely happy with this purchase. All said, a good buy!"
5,"A long gone band, but a great album","The Blueberries were a major part of the Lexington, Kentucky music scene in the early 1990s. They put on a great live show, and this album highlights some of their best material. I purchased a new copy of this album to replace the one that finally wore out. I look forward to many more listening years with the new copy."
4,Wonderfully Ridiculous,"With this handy manual, you can practice your bird-flipping skills on all your friends! Ratings, illustrations, and smile-inducing prose make this a fun little conversation piece."
2,Edition from Public Domain Books Has NO Illustrations,"I guess you get what you pay for, but can I have my time back?The Kindle version of ""Rembrandt's Etching Technique: An Example"" has NO illustrations! Good lord. Not much of an ""example"" here. Since the illustrations are a central part of this book, one would expect to see them -- even in a Kindle book. So, downloading and reviewing this edition has been a waste of time. Save yours and get the Signalman Publishing edition instead: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GNBMMA/"
2,this game is poopy,"honestly, this game is WAY to hard for my likeing. I played it on the easiest setting and it was incredibly hard. you can get hurt if a bug flies by you. literlly."
1,Zero stars if possible,"Look, I am a hardcore Bone fan (Resurrection is one of my all-time favorite CDs) but this disc is just horrible. There are a couple of OK songs on the CD (the first four) but the rest is just awful. The worst part of the CD is the ""Two Glocks"" remix--the beat is completely inappropriate for the song, and totally weak. The Look Into My Eyes remix is OK, but the other two blow, and none of the previously unreleased tracks are any good, except maybe the Easy E song. A serious step down from Resurrection."
4,Not Really A Greastest Hits CD But Still Pretty Good,"Even though some of the songs don't deserve to be on here, there are surely songs that make this LP shine. Songs such as Thug Luv, C Land l.A., Weedman, All Good, Look Into My Eyes (Atlantis Remix), Frontline Warrior, Change the World, Ghetto Cowboy and Sleepwalkers are very good songs for this LP. Song such as 2 Glocks (Remix), Hook It Up, Don't Hate On Me, Can't Give It Up [Rock Remix] shouldn't have been on here in my opinion. They seem like they don't fit this album. Anyway, it's still a good album. If you're a die hard Bone fan, go pick this up."
3,ITS OK,"This cd is ok, it is not there best but it is still tight, the best song on the album is weedman, but it only has bizzy bone in it, that song is tight, then another classic song is Ghetto Cowboy, and then there is a really gangsta style song on it, Sleepwalkers, with Easy-e they RIP it in that song, bizzy and krazy are off the hook fa sho, so i gave this cd a 3 stars. People who dont really like bone thugs wont like this, only the hardcore fan like me, so if u really like them get it, if u dont, well then dont waste your money....PEACE OUTCLEVELAND IN YOUR FACE!!!!!!!!"
2,Worst Bone Thugs Album Ever!,"I like Bone a lot, but this album is not very good at all. I'm not tryin to hate on em or anything, I have The Collection Vol. 1, and that deserves 5 stars. There are a few good songs like ""Thug Luv"" w/2pac,""Look Into My Eyes (Remix)"", and ""Hook It Up"", but the rest were pretty weak. There are a lot of other great songs that could have been put on this album. They should have used some more classics like they did on Vol. 1. This is not the worst CD I have ever heard in my life, but I expected more from a great group like Bone."
5,Give it 30 hours to expand,"I'm 5'9"" and just sink into this chair; it's ridiculously comfortable. I've had lower-back problems for many years now and the foam filling in this chair is really gentle. Basically it lets your body stay in the posture it wants to, and molds around it to support you. I was torn between this and a ""rocker"" gaming chair but eventually chose to order this. I was not disappointed!Pros:+Comfortable+Big+Adapts to your sitting posture+Not filled with one piece of foam like fuf chairs, instead filled with little bits of foam. In my opinion it makes the chair more like a bean bag and less like a giant pillow.Cons:-Somewhat difficult to move around due to its size-Could be too heavy for weaker individuals (I just roll it)-Almost TOO comfortable! I've dozed off in the middle of a video game from how comfortable I was in this thing.-Takes a day or so to fully expandConclusion:Just buy it, it's worth it and you'll be glad you did."
2,very poor support,"this chair was a pretty significant disappointment for me.. The material inside is comfortable, but it provides no support once you try to sit in it. you fall almost into a flat-laying position as soon as your in it, and the foam quickly escapes out from under you to other places in the massively oversized bag. the only way to come close is to push the bag up against a wall or something solid. If there was more ""fuf"" in the bag, it might have the support it indicates in the picture. On the upside, my toddler and pets love it. It appears I bought a 100 dollar pet bed and toddler toy rather than a comfortable chair.... lesson learned, I won't be buying another one of these I havent sat in first... I cannot recommend this product for someone looking for a bean bag that should support you seated in a reasonably upright position."
5,An interesting read,"This is a very interesting book and well worth reading if you can get your hands on a copy.It isn't an essential vitamin C book/article like some of the big general ones, such as:Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C The Clinical Experiences of Frederick R. Klenner, M.D.Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C by Dr. Hickey and Dr. RobertsThe Healing Factor: Vitamin C Against Disease by Irwin StoneVITAMIN C, TITRATING TO BOWEL TOLERANCE, ANASCORBEMIA, AND ACUTE INDUCED SCURVY Robert F. Cathcart, III, M.D.The Ascorbate Effect in Infectious and Autoimmune Diseases by Robert F. Cathcart, M.D.VITAMIN C: The Real Story by Steve Hickey, PhD and Andrew SaulBut it is still a very good book with an intriguing premise.The importance of vitamin C for those with serious diseases, and everyone else, cannot be overstated.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)"
4,Nice...,"I had a chance to see these guys live, and was very impressed. I picked up the album, and I can say that it is one of the better death metal releases I've heard in quite some time. No frills, no gimmicks - just brutally fast death metal with cruel vocals. The music flows together exceptionally well, and even the lyrics are pretty creative. Every now and then, you just need to hear a death metal album that goes for the throat, and ""Path Of The Weakening"" does just that. Death metal fans, take note! If you haven't heard of these guys yet, you will!"
1,Couldn't be More Deceiving,"All that can be said about this book is that if a guidebook of a college is written by one person (with the assistance of 25 people who filled out a survey), it cannot possibly paint an accurate picture of the institution. End of story."
2,Evil as the absence of ....,"In writing her book, ""Thinking,"" Arendt claims that it was Eichmann's absence of thought that underlay his evil deeds; and that her conclusion drew her to write the book (""Thinking"").Her conclusion was wrong. It was the absence of feeling: the lack of feeling experience; the lack of awareness of feeling; and the lack of expression of it -- in all combinations.Despite Arendt's courageous reporting in ""Eichmann in Jerusalem,"" she demonstrates her own absence of thought - in drawing faulty conclusions, a sin of which we are all guilty from time to time, and one that is far less grievous than Eichmann's and those like him."
3,Not Stellar,"For the price it's OK. That being said, you can buy it cheaper at Home Depot. I come to Amazon for good pricing, along with product selection and reviews. I think that Klein has better, more ergonomic strippers that are a better value. I agree with other reviewers that the lack of a locking lever is a ""con"". Take a look at the 11055 (for stranded or solid) or the 11045 for solid wire. Or for something better, look at what Knipex has to offer - Definately more pricey, but much higher quality."
4,Satisfaction,"I was very pleased to receive my order in a timely fashion. They even took extra care in packaging my item. Given the competitors, the price for the size/ounces was very good. I have had no problems and am very happy. Thanks, keep up the hard work."
5,The great reviews stand up,Based on the other reviews I bought this stuff because my 7-week old nose piercing would get red from wearing makeup and sweating when working out. I also have a puppy who likes to lick my face/nose when I'm asleep so keeping my piercing clean is difficult at times. I got this in the mail today and within minutes the redness went away and my nose feels so much better! This is the best alternative to [trying to] soak your nose with a sea-salt solution and a washcloth. I would definitely keep this stuff around even if your piercing has already healed just to keep the area clean.
2,Ehh,"Not a huge fan. For the price, it's not worth it. I used mine up in a period of 2weeks.The only thing I really liked about H2Ocean was the convenience of the spray.I'll stick to Provon. In my opinion it has healed my piercings better and faster. And it lasts a lot longer."
5,"If you are going to pierce,buy this first","I had planned for years on getting my nose pierced, but never did it because I was afraid of the infection. I finally said ""meh"" and went ahead and did it anyway. I bought a really good 18k nose stud and a can of this stuff and I have had ZERO problems. I mean zero. My piercing healed so fast I couldn't believe it. Less than 3 weeks after the initial piercing the stud fell out and I couldn't find it for like half an hour, and having read a lot about how nose piercings close in minutes I figured I would have to go in and get it redone, but I popped that stud back in there like nothing. Buy this. It's good."
5,This stuff really works!!,I got this for my new belly button piercing and it has worked so well! I've had no infections and it has definitely helped with the healing process. I also use it on my gauged ears and it is amazing! I love this stuff and will always use it for all my piercings.
4,pretty cool,This gps system is pretty cool and has lots of features but get ready to start looking for updated maps as the ones that are preloaded are from 2006 I believe. All and all for the money I really do think it is really a great product.
4,Much better than old Road Mate,The Maestro 3140 seems much better than old Magellan RoadMate. It generally loads quickly and most directions seem fairly accurate. The Points of Interest is not real complete or accurate but can often be helpful for many things. My unit sometimes gets right and left confused. The map is usually correct but spoken directions are somethings the opposite but I usually look at map to get better feel for location and degree of turn.
2,Magellan Support less than satisfactory,I received my Maestro 3140 over a month ago which was delivered with a faulty car adapter and a CD with a program on it no one can figure out how to use. I have contacted Magellan's customer service 4 times now. They keep promising to ship out a new adapter in 3-4 days. That was a month ago. I hope people who own these units don't ever have to have help from customer service - they won't get any. My unit is being shipped back asap. Garmin's receive much better reviews.
5,Andromeda-Second Season,"I liked Kevin Sorbo and the Andromeda series since it was first on TV. I probably liked it a lot more than everyone else did but I found it entertaining and wanted to watch it again. The characters are interesting and plots fairly good. The packaging of the box set by the manufacturer was the only complaint I had. The DVD's sit in small, shallow depressions and slide around inside when the box is closed. They probably won't scratch if care is taken to placed them back to back but it's a little inconvenient. Other than that the quality of the set was good."
4,required area,"the only thing i have got to say is this IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO ME < ,if this isn't what you wanted ,STOP ASKING ME jerry"
1,FUR IS DEAD,This just sickens me. How many of these poor defenseless rabbits had to be killed to make just one of these Poncho's???? Please read the facts about the Fur Trade!!! :-(
1,What a sad thing to see on Amazon...,"I can't believe Amazon.com is selling the skin and hair of murdered bunnies. Please, if you're thinking of buying fur, take a minute to learn a little bit about how kind and friendly little rabbits were turned into coats."
3,Hard to say...,"Actually, I would have given it a 5 if it weren't so SMALL that it barely touches my waist (I'm 5'5""). The photo shows it in the fit it should have...unfortunately the photo is untruthful. It fits my 6 year old grand-daughter very well. I don't think it was made for an adult!?!"
3,Not a high point...,"After headphoning the first VU album every morning for weeks this summer, I decided to get another from their catalog.Sadly, Loaded does not get close to the brilliance of their debut. John Cale was apparently the guy who brought the ""art"" and experimentation to the party. His influence is sorely missed on this collection of straight forward rock and roll songs, as are the poetry of Reed's lyrics and subject matter from the first album. Gone as well are the weird, trance-inducing instrumental lines of songs like ""Waiting for the Man"" and ""Venus in Furs"". Reed ends up repeating the line of a chorus or the title of the song in more than one track.The only reason this album gets 3 stars is that it contains a couple rock standards, Sweet Jane (which has a heavenly guitar intro that backs into the familiar strummed chords of the main riff), and Rock and Roll."
3,the velvet's worst,"o.k., it contains ""sweet jane"", ""rock and roll"" and ""new age"", but there's no reason to rave about THIS. it's possible for the velvets to make outstanding albums without john cale, but without john cale and maureen tucker, one of the best drummers ever? this sounds like a regular late sixties pop, sultry, commercial, weak for a band like v.u.. a great disapointment."
3,Slightly less then spectacular farwell in a short and tremendous run,"3 1/2Almost as brilliant as anything they released, there are just a few semi-lazy songs which derail Loaded from achieving full classic status, despite some of Reeds most classic songwriting on display."
4,Loaded with catchy ear candy,"Let's cut to the chase...Sweet Jane and Rock and Roll are two of the greatest, most memorable rocks songs, period. The only reason kids don't play these riffs on Guitar Hero or Rock Band is because, well, it's Lou Reed...the guy who also writes weird songs about aging actresses, lonesome cowboys, the addicted, the perverse, etc.Still, Rock and Roll has a darn near perfect guitar progression, and Lou's penchant for pretty 60's pop arrangements, and right turn, 'pull the rug out from under your feet' intros and mid song switcheroos really shine on Loaded. While there is no Pale Blue Eyes, the album stays strong through Cool it Down (A side), and offers a couple gems via a train ride, and a homage to holding your head high.In short, a classic. This stuff was the Lou Reed source fuel used for his 70's run, amping up the sound, and singing about wanting to be black. Here, he's actually doing it."
3,Should've Changed Their Name,"It was a shock listening to this after a snarling opus like ""White Light/White Heat."" Songs like ""Who Loves the Sun"" and ""Cool It Down"" sound almost like the Association (that is, tepid hippie pop), and ""Rock 'n' Roll"" is inexplicably overrated.Although I love ""Sweet Jane"", ""Head Held High"" and ""Oh! Sweet Nothin'"", they sound like a different band than the one that did the earlier three albums. All the edginess, anger and experimentalism are gone, leaving a mildly satisfying but rather lax experience. I don't listen to the Velvets when I want songcraft and lilting vocals. If you are contemplating your first Velvets purchase, please consider ""...and Nico"" or ""WL/WH"" before this one. There're the disks that made the Velvets matter."
3,"3 stars for Kindle version, 5 for print","There are tables in the book that display as images on the kindle. These are very hard to read and some of them may only be partially shown (it's hard to tell). The content is otherwise excellent, and spot-on. I would recommend the print edition highly, and the Kindle only if you're stuck on it."
2,"Good subject, bad book","I think the book is raising some good questions and is trying to address very important issues and problems in organizational behavior, but the quality of the content leaves plenty room for improvement. The stories and cases that illustrate the concepts of the book are mostly highly artificial and oversimplified, they are poorly written and could not be read with trust. The examples of the ideas that should help to turn the companies around often are on this level: a new screen saver was installed on every computer in the company as a surprise to the employees and it had a graphic image and a slogan ""We will be #1 in the UK market by 2001!"". Boom! After that, the company turned around and conquered UK market!This is definitely well below the bar that Harvard Business School Press should have set for its publications."
5,Delicious,"Wow, this book is so LUSH. It's a total feast for the senses...you can see, feel, taste, hear and smell everything. She's fabulous. Very sexual, very beautiful. Great poems!"
3,Only 4 episodes,"I love Umizoomi & so does my 2 yr old! Since there is not much of a description listed for this DVD, I just want to let you know that it only contains 4 episodes: the rolling toy parade, the legend of the blue mermaid, kite festival, & wild west toy train show."
5,Great self teaching tool,"In this text the author chooses MATLAB as the tool in running computer-based optimization problems. This approach clearly covers all levels of optimization, and the book further supports this coverage through many helpful examples that balance theory with the application. The open-ended problems that are provided are a helpful mechanism for reinforcing the lessons of the text. The website that is a companion to the book, helped me access the reference links to the MATLAB software and the author's own personal site. This web site is a true lifeline to the book."
1,rip off #2,"This was the same as the other gel that I ordered. Again, I thought there was supposed to be more tubes in the order. One (1) tube for almost $10 is ridiculous. After receiving this, I went to my local supermarket and found the same size tube for $1.99."
3,Thought it'd be better,I bought this along with two other Klein tools after reading many reviews. I've probably only used this a couple times and the tip of the pliers has broken. It's not useless as a result but I can't cut with the very edge any more. The metal probably had a manufacturing fault but a much cheaper cutting pliers I have has lasted years and still works.
3,3.5 stars,"This is a pretty good album and it would be even better if Snoop and the rest of his crew weren't all over it. It's a good one to listen to in the car. I would recommend it, but maybe buy it used. That's pretty much your only choice right about now because it's out of print..."
4,Sonic is cool 4ever!!,I just bought this game a few days ago and it's been fun ever scince. Its hard at some parts though but thats ok.This game can be beaten in a week or so with one guy.But it will take longer with all guys and each guy has diff missions so it's always fun. And with all the sweet extrasyou'll be playing it 4 a fun long time. Trust me. (-:
4,Oh Yeah Sonic!!,"This game was awsome, although Iloved Sonic Adventure 2 battle more. sa2b had a better story that will catch your heart. Sonic DX is a very nice game too. You could even get up to 12 classical sonic games."
1,Director's Cut?,"There's many ways that Sonic's 3D games could be improved, unfortunately, Sega missed every one of them with this sad excuse for a quick-cash-game. Director's what? ""DX"" is basically exactly the same as ""Sonic Adventure"" for Dreamcast, but (as the promotional materials rave) ""with extra features"".I'm sorry, but ""classic"" Game Gear Sonic games and some more of those insanely difficult ""beat the level in 2 minutes"" missions isn't anything worth adding. Am I the only one that realizes that Game Gear had NO CLASSICS? That's why it failed!I can understand how GameCube owners who haven't played the original ""SA"" would like this, but seriously, when you already own the game and have beat it, why buy it again for some stupid features, unnecessary missions, and more of that Chao garbage? Graphical improvements? No. From the screenshots I've seen, it has only one graphical improvement: the toes of Sonic's shoes are now rounded. Oh, wow..."
2,Not For Us,"My 2 year old son weighs 34 pounds and is way too big for the seat now. It was okay at first, but not anymore. It's also unpleasant to clean, especially if your child uses it to poopy. We also had trouble with the flushing part. Our son gets into everything and had it broken in no time. I also purchased the Baby Bjorn potty seat for our adult toilet. I think it's a much better way to go. WAAAAAAy easier, less messy, and it doesn't get in the way."
4,Looks just like the real thing!,"The nice thing about this potty seat is that fact that it looks similar to a real toilet. I have seen that some toddlers have a hard time converting from potty chair to toilet because the chair is more ""kiddie"" and a lot less daunting than the big, boring toilet. Potty training with this is much easier because they feel like ""big kids"" when they use this potty chair and then can't wait to use the big real one like a grown up. It makes real flushing sounds and even hold a roll of paper, so they get used to the real toilet faster. It's also nice that it has a lid so they get used to closing the lid down, too. It's not too hard to clean either. It may not look as fun and do the same things as other potty chairs do, but it sure does help teach them easier!"
5,Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this potty! I bought the graco soft seat and the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer, but my toddler would have nothing to do with them. Not that the other seats are bad, he just didn't want to go on the potty. When he saw this mini toilet with the flushing and paper holder he fell in love. He started going on the seat all on his own the same day! It is not wobbly as a previous review stated, I have it on my wood floor and it doesn't budge because of grips on the bottom. It is simple plastic, yet is sturdy. My toddler also doesn't pull it apart like he did with the Graco seat. I say it is definately worth the $$$ if you have a hard to train toddler."
3,So far so good...,"Only when my daugther expressed interest in the toilet, did I bother purchasing this toilet. She wanted to sit on our toilet, so I thought the time was nearing for the training to begin. She very much enjoys sitting on the toilet, and because she liked flushing ours, the miniature version was fun too. The handle is hard to push down though. We've not advanced to actually ""making"" in the toilet yet, but I think we're getting close. My only bit of advice is: DO NOT show your child that how the seat comes out (to empty). My daughter likes to take it apart which has the potential for being a very bad thing. It is also on the large side, so if you have a small bathroom, you may have trouble fitting it in. You could leave the tank off, but then there's no extra fun to it. Can't comment on the good/bad for training a boy."
3,Was disapointed,We bought this because my neighbors daugher loved it. My son thought it was neat but had a very hard time peeing in it without it spilling all over the place. the splash guard does not stay in very well at all. It's not big enough to stop pee. I gave it to a friend of mine who had a girl. I do not recomend this toilet for boys.
5,Alice.... I am in wonderland,"Great book!Traditionally, I believe cookbooks should have pictures to go along with the recipes but this book does not need it.They are insightful stories which accompany the recipe and makes up for it in my point of view.I am loving this book and am happy that I make the purchase from mass books. Great price; and prompt shipping. I will be ordering again!"
4,TL filter,"New design, funtional, highly recommended. Outer coating tends to rub off if handled too much. Otherwise, great product, good price and swift delivery."
2,Oil Pressure Drop - Caution,"This oil filter uses extra pleats to achieve the extra filtration. Problem is there is a fine line between filtering the oil and restricting oil to the pump. Many ""motor-heads"" out there warn about this filter restricting oil causing a pressure drop.Personally, the standard Purolator or Wix filters are the best out there for any situation. Just change your oil and filter every 4 months or 4k miles and you'll never have an oil related failure (caused by the oil)."
3,"To be,or not to be, Divine:)","This book was very useful in order to look at different points of view taken by the auther about christianity in a theatre based approch.This novel per say was more how to be a christian in theatre and examples of pieces of script to base the opinions on.Acturally throughout the whole book you can find very interesting pieces of work,and why it was chosen.This book is great for young to old readers of the christian faith or not,although I do recomend younger readers to have a parent along to explain some of the text.I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Blast from the past.,"I bought a copy of this when I was in grad school. 1985 at a Cutlery World near Colerain Heights OH. I don't know of anything else which is such a snapshot of the mid '80s survival knife scene-decently written, capably illustrated with mostly black and white photos, and a really scarce book. Lots of knives which came and went quickly. My copy is well used in 2012.Supposedly author Smith passed early into his writing career, anyway the two J E Smith books I know of are really scarce.These are, if anything, a little below the going rate for these when they show up-$100 US for a mint copy seems to happen occasionally. I have no connection to the seller, don't know them at all."
1,"very attractive pictures but lacking on ""how to""",I purchased this thru Readers Digest and expected instruction on how to perform the various functions..This the book did not do..It provided only info on what is contained on the Internet but not how to use it..
5,Superb!,The singers are excellent! It beats the usual baby sounding kid music. This is music that EVERY age can love to hear!The Alphabet Song teaches the Spanish Alphabet with excellent beat. It makes you want to dance!The Counting from 1 to 10 song is repetitive but the music helps it stick.The Numbers to Twenty has a great beatLearning Colors teaches colors.Days of the week is an excellent song!and the rest are good too :DDefinately recommendedand it has a huge age group span of 5 to 12 years! How many kid's music has THAT kind of a span?
5,Exactly what I was trying to find,"My daughter had this same one when she was younger, but the tape finally popped. I wanted to replace it but could never find it because it looks totally different. She is homeschooled and I want her to learn more Spanish. She hadn't heard the songs in so long, but as soon as the cd started, the smile on her face was so big. Before, she was always telling me the name for different animals in Spanish and it really built her confidence. I loved hearing the alphabet in Spanish too. I think this is a great tool for learning."
2,Not much to it,"I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like ""Hello"", Please"" and ""airplane"" and even teaches you to ask ""Where are the suitcases""... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more."
5,Perfect for soap,"I decided to try this for soap-making.Other thin plastic molds not only lost their shape if the soap was a little too hot, but made it difficult to remove the soap afterwards. This silicone mold made perfect bars of soap, and it was very easy to remove the bars after cooling. There was no need to put them in the refrigerator and then have to deal with the soap's excessive sweating afterwards.I think this might be useful for a lot of other things, too - like gelatin or ice or individual portions of fudge for bake sales - in addition to baking."
1,READ THIS REVIEW!!! AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This toy never worked straight out of the box. It looked interesting in concept but once I opened the box I spotted the first problem...the rear stabilizer was misshapen and the plastic film was never glued on properly (no quality assurance to be sure) The carbon fiber can't be straightened..it only breaks. Well I wanted to try it anyway...but after charging...NOTHING! The little motor never spun up..it just sits there. Overall...a complete waste of money. No wonder it was on sell.DON'T BUY THIS! You've been warned. (I guess you could get one that that actually works...but I'll stick to Vegas when I want to gamble.
5,Great Pictures & Large Print,I love this calendar because I love Jack Russells and especially because of the calendar's size and layout. I need a calendar that I can read from across the room and this one fits the bill -- the squares are large enough to write a good amount of information in and the numbers are large enough to see when I am on the phone and need a quick date reference. Overall I am extremely pleased with this calendar and I would recommend it to anyone who requires large print and loves dogs.
5,Best one yet,"I really Like the newest NOW album. The music is current, and its better buying this cd, then scouring the radio-waves, to find these songs to tape. Cant waite for NOW6 and see what will be on that one."
4,Great Album!,"I Strongly recrammend this Album because it features tons of radio hits and alot of good songs as well. Included on this album are ""It's My Life"" Bon Jovi, ""Kryptonite"" 3 Doors down, ""Show Me the Meaning Of Being Lonely"" Backstreet Boys, ""Jumpin Jumpin"" Destiny's Child, ""It's Gonna Be Me"" *Nsync, ""Case Of The Ex"" Mya and many other songs as well. So go get it if you like any of these songs because it is worth it."
3,"Good songs, but they're played out",I'm not sayin this CD's picks of songs aren't the songs that everyone loves.. it's just they are the ones that are sooo played out. Those are the songs that are always on the radio.. So I personally wouldn't want this CD just because if i wanted to hear one of the tracks i could just turn on one of our three or four main radio stations & i guaranteed to hear one of them..
1,Now That's What I Call Derivative!,"Pop-radio dreck, pure and simple. Kids: Just wait - a few years from now (and it probably won't even take THAT long), this will be a CD that you'll be embarrassed to have in your collection.A who's-who for a future ""Where Are They Now?"" segment..."
2,Grasso is not what they say.,I have been looking for a good water proofer for leather for a long time to use while Elk hunting in the rocky Mtn. I bought a large jar of Grasso and went hunting. I applied it to my shoes and set them in the sun in a window. two days later it had not all soaked in. Nothing had been put on these for a long time. I live in mid WY and it is dry here. I wore the shoes while hunting at timber line. 4 days after I had put Grasso on my shoes we were caught in a rain- snow storm. After about 2hrs. walking back to camp in the rain I took my shoes off and squezed about 1/2 cup water out of my sock.
5,fast delivery,delivery time is fast. The estimate time was two weeks but it arrives within 5 days after ordering online.Expedite delivery
3,it's ok,The book gives you a general idea about your backs and how to take care of it but nothing in-depth.
5,Back Care Basics,This was a wonderful place to find information regarding the back and how to gently begin a yoga program without further injuring an old injury and creating more pain.
2,SadClown,"If this game had been made by anyone else, i may have given it 3 stars, but I'v come to expect much more from Square-Enix. The game has a few interesting elements and the usual great SE cutscenes, but overall just failed to grab my attention and hold it.Want a good RPG? go get Final Fantasy X (or any of them except 8 really), or Knights of the Old Republic or Disgaea:Hour of Darkness, or La Pucelle Tactics, or basically anything but this."
3,Play FFX2 in your dress!,"Ummm....what happened? FFX was one of the best games I have ever played. This game seems OK if you are a girl. Common, instead of Aeons you change their outfit! All the characters are girls (basically). Who did square make this game for? 99.99% of the players of FFX are guys. Guys don't like changing outfits, singing pop songs, etc. Don't get me wrong the game is OK so far, but the girly game themes disinterest me. The opening scene made me want my $ back before I even played 1 minute."
1,A Disapointment...,"First of all, I am a long time fan of the final fantasy series, but after playing this game, i've almost lost all hope in it. FF 8 and 9 were kind of disheartening-but when I bought ten, I thought square was getting back on the right track. What the heck were they thinking when they made this game? After the first fifteen minutes of playing I thought it was like a charlie's angels video game (not praise) And Yuna, the polite, kind, Priestess that we knew from X has turned into a trigger-happy singer/hunter(?). Even the graphics seem to be worse compared to the last game.There is soo many plot holes in this game as well. I thought at the end of ten it was said that all the aeons were destroyed? And why is brother so obsessed with Yuna(a relative of his?) Why when you recieve an item does it say ""Scored the key Item ...!"" I'm gonna go to a used game store right now and sell this... I'm sticking with six and seven."
4,Final Fantasy series all tha way!!,"I love the whole final fantasy series, although I wish they would come out with a sequel to Final Fantasy 8. Anyway I'm sooo glad there's a sequel to Final fantasy 10, I haven't beaten it yet but I'm doing my best...It has spectactular graphics, a tight storyline a.k.a. plot. The fighting scenes are better then the first and I'm glad that the main characters are ONLY girls! Sorry, I'm a fellow girl & that's just how I feel...GO Y.R.P. a.k.a. Yuna, Rikku, and Paine!!"
3,"Okay, but I've played better.","This was my second final fantasy game that I have played. My first was FF Tactics Advanced, which i would reccomend alot more than this game. The storyline can get overly confusing, and the battles just don't feel right. I would reccomend it to some, but not too all."
2,Not a Final Fantasy,While the graphics are pretty and the premise somewhat fun this game is more like dress-up. Contantly changing dressspheres and utterly chaotic battles take away from the technical gamer. Those looking for a story will be dissapointed as there isn't much of one . Much is left unanswered and there are many inconsistencies between this game and its' supposed prequel. The music is simply painful. This isn't a game for gamers or for people who like Final Fantasy. It's more like a game for a 13yr old girl (most of whom aren't gamers). I would avoid like the plague.
3,FF-X2 The Real Story,"FF-X2. The problems had nothing to do with characters, plot, expections, etc. The problem is they made it a pain in the ass to get 100% completion, so much so, that its not so hard as to get 100% but not worth it. You have to do certain lameass things like check your video cameras at very specific times and watch many things go on to get 100%. The storyline has to be replayed to get more stuff, a total flaw, because it wasn't that spectacular in the first place.(see Champions of Norrath PS2). The only good thing about this game is you get to be back in the FFX world even if it is only a bastardization of the real thing akin to the Starwars Prequels."
3,not bad,"I have kind of mixed feelings on this game. On one hand, it is a fun game with good graphics. On the other hand, it seems maybe rushed. I think Square was relying too much on ""sex sells"". Also, its missing a lot of elements that makes Final Fantasy what it is. It doesnt really have the same feel as other FF games."
3,An Alright Game,"This game was ok. The disc wasn't scratched when I got it, but at the end of the game after I had played it, it started skipping around the end credits, then it stopped all together."
2,ohh noo,"As a person who has played basically ever RPG in existence and has a special affinity for FF i have to say this game is just bad,this is the first true sequel to FF but thats not necessarily a good thing, FF was kept fresh through constant switching of storyline, expansive worlds, summons,and a large cast of playable characters but all of this is gone creating a mediocre game. i mean FFX was one of the worst RPG'S i ever played but this game is sacralige to the FF universe.graphics don't make a game,a good storyline with many options and characters do, they have killed for me what was once the greatest RPG series of all time. For shame squaresoft for shame.i suggest anyone who wants a good FF game go out and pick up a used ff vii cause thats squaresoft at its best,this is trash"
1,Slop,"Okay, I thought this game was going to be good. I played the 1st FFX, which wasn't to bad, but neede some improvments. This game however, really disappointed me. This is like a fantasy version of charlie's angels. I knew it was going to be girly from the start, but I thought they would actually DO SOMETHING, not sit around and giggle all the time. This is just blah, so don't get it if you like good characters and story lines. Rikku and Yuna are like bounty hunters and I really can't say I like the new character, Pain, because her name stands for what she is, a pain. So, my advice to you is, rent this game if you really want to play it, but don't waist 40 bucks."
2,Dissapointing....,Ok i may not be the one to talk because i had never played a ff game before but this game really blew it. It seemed more like a little girls doll game. The whole movie star/treasure hunter was kinda weird and then they had to be these incredible fighting machines and incredibly dumb at the same time made me really made while playing it. All in all the game sucked mostly because of its story line.
3,DIsapointed,"I'm sure many people have looked at this title and thought...Great another FF game to play. However if you are loking for indepth storyline and game play we all have come to associate with the Final Fantasy name you will be disapointed. The majority of the game is sidequests. Although the new battle system is fun and a good idea, one wonders why square didn't just make a new game just for it instead of trying for a sequal. The main characters are weak at best. As with most girl characters in any RPG realm.A sad change for me was that they took out all the music you associate with the FF games and replaced it with bad pop type music. I was suprised to see that even the winning battle theme was removed.Even with all that it was fun to shpere hunt and check out what all the old character group was up to."
4,The only review that you'll need,"I would first like to start by saying that whoever says final fantasy X-2 is a sequel would be stretching, it is more of a side story not a sequel. I will make this review short and sweet.... The story is like you are at one big slumber party for the three main characters, and Brother sounds and acts like richard simmons. The graphics are good, but at times the movies on the game can be blurry. There is a little bit of slowdown, but not enough to affect gameplay. As if the sphere system wasn't confusing, the dress garment grid is lame and unimaginative. The battle system is an active battle system, meaning that you must always be on your toes because the game does not stop to let you pick your moves. In conclusion I think that the games plot, dialog and battling are all mediocre compared to what we have come to expect from final fantasy...."
1,Not so good.,"If you thought about what would happen if you took FFX and crossed it with britney spears/Nsync that is what you would have. Yes, I am a man, I like looking at good looking women when I'm playing games. But this is just foolish. The main characters act as if they are 12. The game is marketed towards 14-17yr old horny boys. I loved FF5-9, but this is just sick. Why can't Square make a good oldschool FF. Heck, if they took FF6 and redid it with the new graphics, maybe tweak the plot a little bit to give it a little new jazz for old school FF people. The job system is nice, (FFX had the worst leveling system ever...), but they couldn't just call it ""Jobs"" no, they had to call it ""Dress Spheres""...More crap thrown in. Square, fire your writers and hire someone who knows whats up and make the best Final Fantasy EVER!"
4,great game,"this game is much different from FFX. actually, this game doesn't look like RPG. the storyline isn't straight coz there are so many missions to be completed besides its storyline. There are 3 different endings, so u can play it more than once if u wanna get all those endings. this game has more fun than previous FFs coz there're so many mini games and sidequests to play. however, this game is more difficult since the enemies can attack your characters while u're choosing the command. so, u have to choose the command as fast as u can. This game is also confusing because i dunno how to manage the dressspheres. there are so many dressspheres and garment grids, and each dressshpere and each garment grid have specific ability.WARNING: If u like men to be the main characters DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"
3,Why?,"I will give props to SquareEnix, it's a good game, but I have to ask: Why?Why make a sequel?#1, I never liked Yuna to begin with, especially her American version voice actor, who always sounds like she's out of breath or something.#2, The act too girly. It scares me.#3, I don't see how this is supposed to answer what happened to Tidus. (or maybe I am not understanding the story)It's a good game, but I see no reason for it to have been made. They could've released XI and XII and VII sooner if they haven't wasted their time on this one. (Yes, they are re-releasing FFVII for PS2, along with 'Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children,' a movie about a few years after FFVII takes place. It'll come in a while. Wait.)"
4,A good game,"FFX-2, was a good game as it has amazing graphics and the voice acting was done amazingly well. The plot wasn't as bad as most ppl made it out to be. I think because it was a different take on a Final Fantasy title, most veterans disliked it. I, myself enjoyed this new spin. It was also a direct sequel to a Final Fantasy, which lead to hype. The story was not as dark as most of the Final Fantasy titles that we've seen, but thats because it wasn't what we are used to in a FF title. It wasn't the 'failed-clone' plot, or 'evil-sorceress-from-the-future', or 'evil-brother-from-alternate-realm' plot, but it was had it's dark moments. Yuna is having a dilemma with herself because of the sacrifice that she made 2 years earlier. She feels she should have done things differently. Overall, this game was no where near as great as FF 7, or Xenogears or any other classic, but it was still a good game. Definately try this game."
2,Final Fantasy X is far superior...,"Simply put, this game is no comparison to Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy X-2 is a disgrace to the entire series. first of all, there are only three playable characters, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine compared to the several characters on the other Final Fantasy games. Compared to FFX, X-2 has no aeons, overdrives, overkills, and no sphere grid. There is only a grid for clothing to change the characters' clothes and types. The storyline to X-2 is also pathetic, the girls are just trying to find spheres in hopes of finding Tidus from FFX. All in all, this game is a HUGE disappointment and I recommend renting this game before buying it."
1,meh,"why make a sequel to a game as bad as FFX?the same annoying characters are as vapid and shallow as ever--they might as well be cardboard cutouts. the character development is ridiculously scripted and can be predicted hours before it occurs.the gameplay is good as it always is, but there are other rpgs with gameplay just as good and with better characters and plot.i am still waiting for a good next gen game from squaresoft."
1,Should not be in final fantasy series,I guess one positive thing I can say about this game is it is nothing like any of the other final fantasy games ever released. Ok the graphics are better so what! In my opinion a good final fantasy game would have a GOOD story line that intrigued you and kept you playing. This game on the other hand takes you on a journey of the sphere hunter yuna(who they degraded from final fantasy X as a high summoner to a shallow teenager) and her cute little friends looking for spheres for her lost boyfriend. Most of the game consists of side quests. You want to know why they are called side quests because they are not the game itself they are things to do on the side! Furthermore you can not even control the camera angle in the game. This games target audience seems to be jr. high teenage girls. I truthfully can not see how any gamer would enjoy this game.
3,feels awfully empty,"this game isn't necessarily bad, it just isn't that much fun. the story is absolutely nothing special, the dialogue is sometimes offensively bad, the gameplay isn't much of a step up from FFX (which in my opinion wasn't all that great to begin with - the sphere grid in essence was still a matter of leveling, only made more tedious), and overall the game feels awfully soulless. it's also rather disappointing that square-enix re-used an extremely large portion of the graphics, because this game is still sold for full price and it looks and plays like an expansion pack. it's unfortunate and a real shame, because the final fantasy license is getting cheapened with a lack of ingenuity."
1,rip off,"I must have read the description incorrectly, because I thought there were multiple tubes in the order for that price. One (1) tube for almost $10 is a rip off. I picked up one in a supermarket near my home and it was $1.99."
5,A Beautiful Story,"This is a wonderful piece of writing. Ostensibly about boating and about the loss of the author's lover to AIDS, it is in fact a powerful and evocative love song to both. I am not a boating person, but I felt as if I were on the sea with that beautiful young boy, savoring the wind and the salt spray and those fleeting but unforgettable moments of profound happiness, shared. It brought tears to my eyes, but not the maudlin, grieving tears that so many of these memoirs inspire. These were tears of joy, for the love these two young men had together, and gratitude to the author for sharing it with me.Victor J. Banis"
4,Great detail,"I ordered this train for my husband for Christmas. He loved it. However, this is not meant for small children because of its durability. Still a great buy."
1,Hate it!,"I received this for Christmas and was so excited to use it. Hate it! Everything stuck to it. I seasoned it and used oil while cooking and it still stuck. I have Emeril's 12"" skillet which I love, but this piece was awful. It was very rough as well like bits of material were stuck under a coating. Big disappointment."
2,disappointed,I love Emeril and expected this grill to be awesome. Is Not!Everything sticks to the grill side no matter how much I pre heat.Cleaning it is a nightmare!I have to use spray oil on the griddle side to avoid sticking.So disappointed!
1,Does not heat evenly; Cheaply Made in China,"I bought this from BB&B and would have bought Lodge Logic (made in USA), but this was the only brand available. We own several pieces of cast iron cookware and I love it. Thank goodness for BB&B's return policy, since this griddle does not heat evenly at all. We tried using it several times and got awful results with half burned/half raw eggs and pancakes. This griddle has a weird finish and I would not personally venture to call it true cast iron. For the same price you can buy something made in the USA versus this one, which is made in China of questionable materials and therefore substandard results. If Emeril has the opportunity to put his name on something in the future, I hope he sticks with his sustainability guns and does not go with this manufacturer."
2,Very mixed feelings.,"I tried SlimQuik over the summer. I took it for two weeks. I stopped taking it because I was worried I'd pass out from dehydration (as I've always liked drinking water, but it was really hot and I was CONSTANTLY thirsty the entire time I took the pills...) and also because I was very moody. I don't know if it's because I have a history of anxiety disorders, but they made the most anxious and irritable that I've ever been. If you suffer from similar issues, do not start this product if you are going through a stressful time."
3,"Tried it, but won't buy more","Here's the gist:I lost a couple pounds with one bottle, but I think that was all water weight. While on these, I made frequent trips to the bathroom and I was always thirsty. Benefit? Since this has directic properties, I didn't have to take a water pill during menstration.Yes, I found myself to be constantly aroused in the first 2-3 weeks. My fiance loved it, but was disappointed the ""effects"" weren't permanent. :)Overall, the product did the following: pushed me to drink constantly because I always felt dehydrated, I pottied ""a lot"", felt especially frisky for a few weeks, and that's about it."
2,Better Home Veterinary Books Available,"If you are going to buy a home veterinary book, then my suggestion is: The Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook by Debra M. Eldredge DVM, is a better reference book. The Hound Health Handbook doesn't compare."
5,MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!! RAWR!!,"I remember people standing in line at the bowling alley just to get a crack at playing this game.Then they released em on consoles, too bad if you owned a SNES SUCKA BWAHAHA all sweat and no blood for you.Still remember the blood code.A B A C A B B ""GET OVER HERE!""Then when I heard ""Test your might"" I would rack my knuckles back and forth ripping off skin to the bonebut it was worth it cuz I just CRUSHED that mofu'n diamond.Today MK is just not the same, I'd almost say the idea of a story line ruined it.Before it was random fighters around the world fighting it out to save/end the world with only brief descriptions.Now everyone has feelings and s#!t and superheroes some how jumped on board. BOOOOOOOOO."
5,Great Game!,"Looks complicated at first, but easy to catch on. We are adults playing, don't know how kids would fare. Our playing partners have now purchased for themselves."
2,"Quality game, just a bit boring","First, I will preface by saying the game is extremely complicated to get started with, you really need some outside help to figure it out. The instructions are good, but there are about 12 pages of rules, so a quick play the game is not.That said, once you figure it out, it is not difficult to play, but it is not particularly fun, either. There only a few options on what you can do each turn without basically giving massive points away to the person next to you. For example, pretty much no one wants to pick up the card to ship goods, because you give the person to your right first dibs on everything, so you give them a truckload of points. This results in people sitting around and picking the same cards over and over to avoid losing the game.All in all, a well made, quality game, but just a bit on the boring side."
5,Beautiful,"While I may like this book partly because I know its main locale, anyone who has ever loved a person or a place with pain, obsessed, fantasized, felt exiled, or contemplated history and fate, will find this a fascinating read."
5,Required Reading for Marketers,"There are 3 keys to your success: Execution, Execution, Execution. Roman and Hornstein deliver - with precision - on the who, what, where, when and how of each. A must read. John Wanamaker would give it 'two thumbs up'"
5,Enjoyable,It is a very fun game to play. You will get a lot of enjoyment from the game. Overall this a very good game to purchase.
5,The best in the market,"The How-To Guide to Building a Monolithic Concrete Slab FoundationThis nice DVD contain easy and practical guide on how Monolithic Concrete Slab Foundation should be built. It safe time and money by doing it right the first time. This DVD is like having a coach with you on site who share his wonderful knowledge step by step with you for free. It is an excellent investment for home owners, contractors, Architects and Engineers. I highly recommend it.Dr. Bill Taha, S.E., Structural Engineer"
3,Looks Cool if Displayed,"This car looks awesome. There is a small button in the back that you can press and the car lights up and makes noises, but the sound is really low. My son has had this toy car for a year now and he's busted it. He pulled off the fuel line and two of the wheels. I cannot snap them back on. If you are into Back to the Future and wish to use this car as a display item, then it's worth buying, but if you're buying this toy for a three-year-old for $30, which is what it costs at some Target stores and what it costs for us, then think about it because this toy busted within the year."
5,"As long as you're looking for a puzzle game, this is a good choice","This is an excellent version of 'sokoban,' the Japanese block-pushing puzzle game. Basically you move blocks around one step at a time trying to get them into a handful of designated spots, one for each box needing to be moved. I haven't played through the whole thing but so far the levels build gradually in difficulty, as they should, with no abrupt leaps in difficulty. The music is cheesy ""smooth jazz"" but it suits the game reasonably well. If you're looking for a puzzle game on the Genesis this is probably a good choice, as long as you don't mind not having cutesy characters etc. The only real problem with the game is that the name is a little dishearteningly awkward."
4,"Good Book, but leaves loose ends","Lady Knight, the fourth book in the Protector of the Small, follows Kel as she goes to war with Scanra in the North. She gets assigned to protect refugees at a refugee camp. In the beginning she feels this is a petty assignment. By the end of the book she is happy with the assignment. This book by itself was very good. I enoyed it a lot. But in the sceme of things, I find that it wasn't enough of a conclusion for all of the other 3 books. It left too many loose ends hanging. But it was still a good book."
5,"Amazingly written, but not so much an end!","It left me hanging, I guess I got use to Pierce writing the romance into all her books that I just wanted to know who Kel ended up with in the end. Though it does suggest Dom in a slight way.But it is definitly a MUST read, I couldn't keep my eyes off it, I even forgot to babysit my brother because I got too into it. It has soo much action and really shows the true side to a knight, what with Alanna's being a lot about her magic and Daine's being about animals.You have to read this book! I hope Tamora Pierce keeps up this world's series. I love Tortall and all the characters!"
5,You won't regret this purchase,"Its incredible the amount of clamping pressure these k-bodys provide. I just got one set, and plan on getting as many as I can afford! Simple to use and make squaring up a door or cabinet just about as simple as possible. This kit is a great value!"
2,Shocked,I am truely amazed that someone could write a history of electricity without even mentioning Tesla!
1,Incorrect History,Credit is given to some but not all that are actually a part of this history. Where is Nikola Tesla in all of this? Yet again a 'historian' is not acknowledging the true participators in hisotry.
3,More than counting,"Book is mostly good for preschool. Some activities are good but others are the same games with different counters or game boards. The book isn't all that great. There are good questions to ask the students as they play. However, students are to be questioned as they play the games. In a kinder classroom, that is impossible to do with four games and one teacher."
3,quality suffers with time,I bought my dremel 395 tool thinking that it would be a nice upgrade to my 5 year old cheap and nasty 20 dollar chinese rotary tool. It isnt an upgrade at all it really isnt and the pretty exterior and attachments dont compensate at all. It has not been as durable or as powerful as the chinese knock off. 15 years ago I knew dremel to be quality but it seems that quality is no longer a dremel trait.
1,Don't buy one,"I received one of these as a gift some time ago. From new the shaft vibrated quite a bit, I was told that was ""normal"". I didn't use it much and by the time the warranty was up the bearings were obviously shot and the shaft didn't just vibrate, it rattled. Soon after the speed control went bad and the motor would only run at the middle speeds. This thing really did not get much use and then the coupler from the motor to the output shaft broke so it didn't even spin anymore. I took it apart and thought maybe I'd order a bunch of new parts and rebuild it, but I see that some parts are already no longer available. Forget that idea. So I made a coupler myself out of some small gasoline hose, put it back together and it runs about as good as it ever did. One of these days I'll throw it out and buy a good tool instead."
2,Fast but a hassle,"I got this printer for free; I wouldn't recommend buying it. It uses up ink like crazy, and the cartridges are more expensive than other canon ink cartridges. While the printer quality is fine, it's a hassle to use. It took me a long time to get the hang of loading the paper (it can't hold much at a time, or the paper jams). Worse, there's no place for the paper to go after it leaves the printer. This means you're stuck catching the paper yourself after it comes out if you don't want your paper scattering all over the place. It's small, which is good for small spaces, but you have to sacrifice perks that better printers have like different settings.Try a different small printer if you want real quality."
1,Negative,"The bra itself feel good when you first put it on, but after a while it starts to roll up from the bottome. It also does not do a thing for one's figure as there is a band right through the middle that flattens the breast. If I had been on the ball, I would have returned it right away. I can get a much nicer stretch type bra at Kohl's department store for much less."
2,Not for large breasted women,This bra has great potential for comfort.However this bra does run small and maynot be for women with larger breasts.I am a D size and the bra always rode upin the back and cut into my ribs.Even when I tried on a larger size it rodeup my back for some reason. Will I ever find a brathat doesn't hurt? Such a bummer.
1,SPANKED BY SPANX,"Not so happy with this bra, yes it felt like I had nothing on and it showed, no support what so ever."
1,Spank Spanx,"This bra looked and promised to be comfortable. It sort of is until it rides up until your breasts fall out of the bottom band. Sadly,it also flattens, not flatters. Don't buy this bra if you are physically active in any way."
1,Not worth it,"I just got one of these in. I put it on, as instructed (step into it and pull it up over the hips). It is very comfortable, and that is the only good thing I can say about it. It barely covers part of my breasts. There is no hint of support. It will ride up in the back if I try to adjust it. I would expect to pay about 3 dollars for a bra that supports the way this one does. I can't even use it for a sleep bra because I would fall right out of it. I will not be buying anything else from this company. For reference, I wear a DD cup, which this bra is supposed to be able to fit. A woman with small breasts that don't need much support might love this. For the less perky individuals, we need to keep looking."
3,Bummed. I hoped it would be the perfect bra.,the cut is too short to cover the top of the breast enough for me...so I have that bulge that I hate to see especially since it really enhances the left breast since it is slightly larger than the other one. : (
4,Comfy!,"Since I'm a 36B, this bra seems to give me enough support. It's ugly as hell (looks like orthopedic hose), but was exactly what I was looking for, which is a comfortable everyday bra with just enough support that doesn't require underwire or other bits that dig into my skin. I've been wearing it everyday for the past 3-4 days, and it's still good. Ordered two more."
2,This basket was okay for the price,The basket looks like it is worth about $9.99. The sunflower basket is a much better deal itm was bigger and had more items. The Rose basket is much smaller then I had expected.
1,dross,"This book is very poorly written and consists of fabrications and distortions of the truth. The author is considered by many to be an anti-Semite. I find it surprising that anyone other than the author would rate this book. One can reasonably come to the conclusion that the author signs in as various aliases so that he can boost the ratings of his book by giving it 5 stars.The Law School is by no means racist and given that this book is written by someone who holds anti-Semitic views, I very much doubt the reliability of this account of the supposed incident that took place in the Law school.Avoid at all costs as it is likely to cause major offense."
1,Completely inept,"I found the content of this book totally ridiculous. It consisted of the inane ramblings of an old man, who bore a grudge against a highly reputable law school. The suggestions made e.g. ""the Law School at Cambridge University is racist"" are totally absurd. The author, Kim, appears to be suffering from delusions. It is a well established theory in many Cambridge colleges that Kim is a 'sex pest', who prays upon 1st and 2nd year female LLB students. I am delighted that the Law School had the guts to stand up for the rights of these female students against Kim. The Law School quite rightly barred Kim from its library as he posed a constant threat to these female students. It would not surprise me if the tripos exam results of female LL. B. students had suffered in years prior to Kim's ban as a result of his continual sexual harassment. I would advise readers not to buy this book."
1,Incomprehensible rubbish,I was very disappointed by the lack of coherent reasoning shown in this book by Kim. The content is dubious and the interpretations made are based on false logic. It seems to me that this book was written with the explicit aim of inciting racial hatred between Asians and Caucasians. Kim takes a petty incident that occurred in the Law School at Cambridge University and blows it out of all proportion. Kim distorts the facts to make them support his claim of racial abuse.I find it quite amusing that Kim has to sign on as different people in a desperate attempt to boost the ratings of this poor quality book.(...)
1,Interesting story ruined by inappropriate comparisons,"Whilst I found this book interesting, I felt that Kim could have provided more examples where the Cambridge Law School has been acting in a racist manner to back up his story. Kim ruined what would have been an intriguing account of the alleged incident by drawing ridiculous comparisons with apartheid and Nazism. There may be racism in the Law School at Cambridge, but I doubt it is anything like that experienced by blacks in South Africa during apartheid. Kim claims that there is a Jewish conspiracy, if this is true, shouldn't he try to do something about it instead of crying all the time."
5,Colonialist Taste,"British colonialism is a horrible thing. British royals and government used local peoples (whether they be Asian or African) to subjugate good people of Asia and Africa. They deprived them of their own resources and prevented progress of innocent people. What we see there is a case of colonialist binge on the part of Cambridge University. The negative reviews coming out from Cambridge seem to indicate that Cambridge University authorities have ""bought"" some help British royals did to control good people. Reading the book and reading the negative reviews coming from Cambridge openned my eyes to the colonialist reality that must exist at Cambridge University at the present. It's a shame!"
3,YAY FOR THE OLD SCHOOL!!,"Yes this is a very playable shoot-em-up. And, if this was being reviewed 15 years a ago, I'd give it better cheer.Yet, the graphics for ARROW FLASH aren't that great (for the groundbreaking platform of its time, GENESIS). The game play is okay but not very exciting or original. But overall gameplay and fun it is above average."
3,save $ for variable speed,"Thought it was a variable speed when I ordered, works fine just save $ for variable speed."
5,LOVE IT,"I never watched this tv show until now and the because of Robert Downey Jr on this season ... Robert Downey Jr part Larry and Ally McBeal Calista Flockhart was so good you could feel their chemistry they had a connection so it seemed from day one... I know they are actors but the still had something special on screen and wondrous to watch it was fun to see the wit and personality of Robert Downey Jr it was sad that he was removed from the show, I understand why and it is great Robert got his act together and is back ,, NOw I am watching from the beginning it has been fun to watch the different people on the show."
5,This is a great tatical strategy game with RPG elements.,"This game is unique as it's a tactical strategy, yet you can level up your character. You can compare this game with the Jagged Alliance and Fallout series. I found it a lot of fun and can't wait to play it a second time. The AI is very good so it will add to replay value. It took longer than most game to finish so it has good value. I would suggest giving this game a try."
5,The best Tasty Bite meal.,"This is the best of the Tasty Bite Indian retort-packaged dishes. It is moderately spicy and has a wonderful flavor of eggplant. It is a bit oily, like some Indian foods can be at times. The texture is sort of creamy/lumpy because of the eggplant seeds.It is wonderful with a little microwaved frozen broccoli added to bulk up the meal, along with brown rice and some frozen naan. Yum!This same item is sold camouflaged at Trader Joe's."
5,Graceful,This is the best book I've read in a very long time. It has a fresh style of writting that is a pleasure to read. And the content is one that every parent should read with their children. I would also recommend that it be read by every physician and health care worker. I look forward to the author's next book.
4,Great CD,I had the opportunity of seeing the Prince live at the Getty Center. He has a great stage presence and fun band. I enjoyed his kora playing and recommend this cd to anyone looking to boarden their music awareness. I had purchased the cd at Getty and have enjoyed listening to it.
2,Ok,"This series is pretty bad, the way the lessons are set up won't help you learn anything. Hearing conversations over and over with nothing to go off of doesn't work."
2,This book is okay if you already speak some portuguese,"This book is Okay if you already know the basic words and phrases, It helped me to learn some of the different tenses, and SOME gramatical rules; but it is not put together in a logical way, where you can just turn to a certain chapter to refresh your memory on how to say a particular phrase. I would not reccomend it to people who have never studied portuguese or spanish before, becuase it will not give you the tools to form sentances properly. It seems to be more for a traveler who is planning to go to Brasil for a couple of weeks and only needs to know certain phrases. It also bothered me that it is written in British english, not North American. If you are trying to speak fluently, I would definitly not waste your money."
2,SPLASH-IN-THE-PAN,"Tracks 1,2,3, & 4 are the most professional tracks on this CD.The Red Garter section of this CD is way below standard for musical content. This entire section sounds like a 'rush job'.Each song in the Red Garter section sounds the same due to Jack's very weak right-hand technique and the absence of emotion and dynamics coming from Jack's banjo.Also, what adds to the downside of The Red Garter section on this CD was the ""we're going to do this entire session in only one take on each song"" attitude of K.C., the producer of this project."
5,Can't keep my son or husband off this game!,Santa brought this for my 8 year old. He has the best time playing this game. It holds his attention and the graphics and music are just fun. My husband loves it too. It is worth the cost. Who needs a Play Station when you can get qualtiy games like this for your computer!
2,Not recommended unless.......,"Unless you only plan to wear it for 1 year. After 1 year, the leather will get to soft and the shape will be out of whack."
2,Not very satisfied,"This product is ackward to use in tight areas. I do like the different attachment you can use. I found using them by hand was easier, because the disign of the tool positions the sanding attachment in a way of uncomfortable hand position on the tool. This tool also viberates back and forth, so you need to observe the grain of the wood, I expected it to be an orbital in movement. I need something comfortable for hours of sanding. This product gets a D+."
3,Great product but not a great value.,This is a great product that will save the owner much time. It is a must have for anyone that does home/auto repair. I was trying to remove a rusted nut when I bought this product. I had it off in seconds. I can't say enough on how useful this tool is. I gave it only 3 stars because the Dremel 3956 or 3962 are a better value. Both the 3956 and 3962 have a variable speed Dremel instead of just a 2 speed Dremel and the 3956 includes the flexable shaft. The price to go from the 2850D to the 3956 is about $10 and the 3962 less than the 2850D. Still you can't go wrong on any of the Dremels.
5,Great,"I have purchased alot from this site and I am happy to know that I can trust Amazon.com. I am happy with the game that I purchased, for my son. He doesn't want to put it down. It had a problem getting here. I contacted the seller and the problem was resolved quickly and well organized. NO questions asked. Thanks alot for the great customer service, as well, great product.. I would definately buy from this seller again!!"
2,Eh............,"I was a huge fan of the original Final Fantasy for the NES. As a matter of fact, it's my favorite game of ALL time. So when I heard this game was coming out, I was ecstatic! Well I finally bought it and I must say this : ""If it isn't BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT!""Pluses:I do enjoy the updated graphics.MINUSES!:I enjoyed the fact that the most number of spells you could get in the original was 8. Changing the magic format to the ""New style"" makes this way too easy. Why did they change the names of the weapons and bosses like Kary? And WHY those stupid shrines!? And this is what REALLY gets me. NO WARMECH! The BEST character EVER (!!!) and they change his name! WHY!?If this game was exactly like on NES (Like Zelda and Metroid and Link), then this would DEFINATELY get a 5 star rating but because it isn't, it's LUCKY it gets this rating..The second game isn't much better.Nintendo just needs to release ""The ORIGINAL"" (no remade graphics or anything!) and then I'll be happy."
2,Not what I thought,"I found this book to be disappointing. There are part of it that are insightful and make you think, but overall the story seems rather disjointed. I am not sure what the theme is supposed to be - if it's the family, the book doesn't give a complete picture of all the family and what happens to them. If it's the spiritual development, it is lacking because you never know exactly what the husband Stephen's faith consists of and the wife Anne's faith is nonexistent until at the end of her life she finds something but what it is seems vague. I really didn't much like this book - at the end I got the feeling that life is awful and then you die. It is not uplifting or inspirational in the least."
3,"Okay, but not a star","I purchased this saw to replace a Benchtop brand that I had. The saw assembled easily and the powerful motor was impressive. I also liked the 60 degree miter to the right. I was disappointed with the poor vise clamp and no standard extension wings. The saw had too much plastic and felt a little cheap. My bottom line is this, Hitachi makes very good power tools but this is not one of their best. It is okay but no better than my Benchtop especially when you consider that you are paying twice the price for a similar tool, both made in Taiwan, with the cheaper one having more accessories and just as durable.. Well, that is my opinion. The saw is okay but not five star or american quality."
4,Good one .,"I can not find any difference in an image taken with and other taken without the filter. So, I guess that is good, because I buy it to protect the lens from scratches and dirt, but I was afraid of the halos and gost images, and all the extrenge creatures that I have seen with the ""Polarized"" Zeikos U.V filters.The filter fit almost nice in the canon EF-S 18- 55 IS lens But I think this is due to the plastic lens thread.The HMC do a great work keeping the reflection out of the image but, sincerely, it is a pain to clean this filter."
5,Love what it does to my pictures!,"I'm still learning how to use my Canon Rebel T1i DSLR and bought this due to the fact that it can protect my lens (as I've ""almost"" created a dent to it a few times). And I love what it does to my pictures! It does filter it in a way for some colors to be crispier. It's not a huge difference but still there."
3,disappointing...,"This movie was O.K. but I've seen better. Luke Malloy (Jansen Panettiere) is a 11-year-old boy who wishes that summer never ends on the last day of summer. Unfortunately, that wish comes true! Except, the last day of summer repeats, and that's not what he planned on. Constantly getting hit in the face, bullied on, and stole from, Luke Malloy must survive the last day of summer over and over again, until he figures out a solution.Although this looks like a funny movie, it is not, watching the same things happen over and over again gets really boring, plus the acting is very weak."
5,Save Time Geocache more,For the beginner geocacher. This book keeps it simple and easy to understand. I recommend this book for any beginner geocacher. I'd like to see an updated Idiot's pocket guide for geocaching with more on geoteaming. Groundspeak does it right. Geocaching is a great hobby for all ages. This book will help you get started...it sure helped me. golfpro
5,Good Intro Book,A very good book foe beginners and those new to geocaching. Gave us some hints and good suggestions for creating and hiding our own cache.
5,Just as it says!,"It answered all my questions. Geocaching is really fun, and this book puts all the info in one place."
3,adequate but not great,"It will split one side of the leg, but is somewhat awkward to get further up the leg for the next use, and tends to grab the leg meat and tear it up a little. not much better than using a fork to split one side all the way up the leg section."
4,Fighting Paratroopers?,"Jim Morris writes a very good book that for the first 150 pages sticks to the gallantry of the Special Forces and the hard work they did. After that though, it mainly gets into his parachuting experiences and talks he has with his friends. Overall though it is a very good book that I would recommend to anyone developing an interest in the Operations of the Special Forces."
5,jds air filter,I love this product. My customers love that I use this in ther homes. I will be getting another one to use permanently in my shop. I Finish a lot of basements. This cuts down on the dust remarkably.
1,No after sales support.,My construction company owns several of these units. The motherboard on one has fried and we have been unable to secure a replacement. We have sent multiple emails to the company with no response. Oh and the unit is less then 2 years old with not a lot of use.
5,Love this collection of songs.,"""Music From the Heart: is a great collection of songs brought to life by Lorie Line with Lorie Line's energetically soothing gentle style."
4,Great music CD,Very nice music CD from Lorie Line. I had never heard of this musician before and ordered for listening to when traveling.
4,"Little Budget, Big Heart","For a little indy film it certainly has some kick. It is definitely better written than most of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood. I think that with more money and time it could have been a well received feature film. I would recommend everyone checking it out. It's definitely not perfect, there are some spots that don't quite work but over all it's well thought out and well done. Congrats to the film maker. You have definite put together something new and worthwhile. I can't wait to see your next film."
2,'ello,"An ok book, but I only really read it to see where all the storylines end up.I'm a huge fan of Battletech books, but this was pretty feeble.Victor Davion started off as a ruthless, tough, capable leader, and ends up a total wimp who looses every war, every battle he's in. Even in this book, where he eventually 'wins', it's only because everyone else carries him.Most of the caracters have changed so much, they are nothing like when they first started out, and don't even seem to progess as they should, suddenly changing whole opinions and outlooks chapter to chapter.I read it once, 'cos it's Battletech. Won't be reading it again unless I'm very bored.P.S. Mechwarrior Darkage is complete crap."
3,"Good story, bad spelling",Not a bad ending for the plotlines. My major complaint is the lack of proofreading in the book - I'm usually very forgiving of the occasional error but the sheer number of spelling mistakes is simply unforgivable and is very distracting.
1,"Ad says cotton, label says 100% nylon","The product description distinctly says ""cotton"" but when the product arrived, the label on the panties says ""100% nylon."" Generally, I must wear 100% cotton, and GA law says no return on panties, so I guess I'm stuck. Please correct your product description so other buyers aren't duped."
4,Almost perfect,"These are beyond a doubt the most comfortable panties I have ever worn, but unfortunately panty liners do not adhere to the material. Other than that I would give it 5 stars. They should redo the crotch material so that people like me who have allergies, can use a panty liner...for that matter pads of any kind will not stick to these panties I suspect. But all that said, I don't even know that I am wearing panties, they are so so comfortable...just the crotch material could use a little work."
2,She's got to be kidding.......,"If you need to cover something,then do it your own way.EXPRESS YOURSELF!I dont know why anybody would want to listen to this record when you can have "" the real thing "" (and plenty of it!).For you guys who like this record,be prepared to be blown away."" FRANCE GALL ""... is the name which will keep you addicted for a long time.Just listen to the original "" Laisse Tomber Les Filles "" (or infact anything from her sixties stuff),and then you'll know what I mean.Sorry April,but 3* for trying.The choice is yours."
5,SF2,"Although Rare and Expensive, Shining Force 2 is the best game for Sega Genesis and is Better than the first version, I own this game and cost me a lot to buy. This Time Zeon the evil god is striking and it's up to the force to stop him and will be tough. This 1994 game is incredible with awesome graphics and build up to 30 characters and raise them to be strong ferocious warriors and defeat devils all throughout the game"
4,It's a Keeper,"I have a Makita LS1212 12"" compound slide miter saw and was looking to compliment this excellent saw with a rugged stand.The Delta 50-155 Universal Miter Saw Stand fit the bill. I had previously downloaded the Delta product manual to check out the stands specifications and discovered the language ""the stand will fit most saws"". I called Delta and spoke with a technician who indicated the Makita should fit on the stand- he was right on. The only draw back on the stand was that the supplied hardware was less than durable. I sheared two bolts while installing the handle on the stand-looked like ""pot metal"" to me! However, for the price , the ruggedness and ease of transport with a large saw, you can't go wrong with this stand!"
3,"Decent enough stand, but it would be nice to have all of the parts","I like this stand, I mated it with a Porter Cable 10"" sliding compound miter saw. I had to use the alternate instructions to set it up but once set up it worked fine. The reason I'm not giving this more stars is because the stand was missing the stabilizing feet."
4,Ozzie and Harriet,Gone are the good ol days of decency and morality.Gone are the days of not having to worry about weither it is safe to go out for a pizza at night or to even turn on the tv in the company of your Minister. For those of us who remember the days when things were different it is good to be able to access the older decent comedy programming like Ozzie and Harriet. Hours of wonderful clean comedy entertainment. It is well worth it at twice the price.
2,"Fun, but very buggy and no support","The game could be a lot of fun, however, it is so buggy that it is nearly unplayable on many computers. I wouldn't advocate any kind of piracy, but if you are thinking about buying, I would strongly recommend finding someone with a copy and making sure it will actually run on your computer before spending any money on your own copy.The game is in serious need of a patch, however, none is forthcoming, and the publisher seems unintersted in fixing the many known problems. If this kind of support is what I can expect from this company, I am unlikely to buy games by this publisher in the future."
3,Small,"They were really small, size should be in the description then you know what your getting. Hard to see it from across the yard"
5,Perfect,These are not some crappy paper targets. They are a thin cardboard that is perfect for hanging just about anywhere.
3,Bb gun targets,"They are fine, but be advised, they are rather small. It took some doing to finally get the new Marlin Cowboy bb guns sighted in because the targets are so small you don't know where the bb's are hitting."
4,Expensive but works better than paper plates,Expensive for no more than what they are but it is nice to just staple them up instead of the paper plates I was using and a magic marker to draw my crosshairs
3,These targets are fine,I wish I would have spent a couple more dollars and gotten the plinking targets that would last indefinitely and given instant feedback.
5,Music that lifts me UP!!!,"Wow, just got this CD and after hearing the whole thing, I can't wait to share it with EVERYBODY!!! This is NOT elevator music. It's warm, rich, ALIVE, wonderful piano + small orchestra/horns, and what exceptional musicians!! I was introduced to Lorie's music at her 2006 Christmas show, expecting to be bored. NOT!!! I never knew how much I could enjoy instrumental music. This CD captures some of the energy of her live show. A must-listen!!!!"
4,Great reflector,great reflector. the only issue i had was that the zipper came off after i had it for 3 days. i was able to put it back on and use it. to be safe i superglues the end of the track so it won't fall off again
3,Does what it should,"It's a reflector. If you're familiar with them you know how useful they are, if you aren't familiar you want one. Consider having an assistant to hold it.This particular reflector has a flimsy zipper. Be sure to push it down so the zipper moves as freely as possible, otherwise the part you grab onto could break off. Mine did. The reflector portion still works great, but it's annoying to have to unzip for reversing/using the translucent portion when it's broken."
3,Nearly Perfect EXCEPT for the ZIPPER,"For a few dollars more...........they could have used a better quality zipper pull tab. Trying to zip around that circle is tough on the zipper and hard on the pull tab. Tab broke on the second use. Like the reflector so much I carefully applied ""J-B Wield"" with a tooth pick to close the tiny loop that goes around the slider. If I baby the zipper ever so gently I get the use the reflector I love..........except for the zipper.Wrote the company begging them to fix this minor nuisance. However if I was a pro I would stay away from this reflector only because of the cheap zipper pull. This coil type zipper is generally among the best zippers. Maybe I just got one of a bad batch? I can live with it."
3,Review for Westcott Reflector,"I just want to re-iterate which many other fellow product buyers have high-lighted in their review, that this product is good except the chain of its case which is very fragile and gets in the way many a times when you want to close. It is some what irritating to spend couple of minutes just to close the case."
4,great!,"Great product!!! i took my girl for outdoor shooting! It really helps to spot on your subject but some of the places doesn't allow pro photographer to shoot without permission!!! Yes, if you're using it they will assume you're pro!"
3,"Great product, but you get what you pay for.","This is my first reflector, so I didn't know what to expect. Overall, the reflector itself is very well made, however within an hour of owning it, I broke the zipper for the cover (not the case). It still works, but it's a little cumbersome to use now."
5,portraits,"works great for 1 person or a small group, makes a huge difference, puts out a real nice lighting espically nice at getting rid of unwanted shadows!!!"
3,Not what was advertised,"The product I received was not what was advertised. The item I received was a generic brand 80cm (about 31"") reflector, rather that the 40"" Westcott model described. It does appear to be decently made and a good value for the price. The misleading and inaccurate description needs to be changed, however.Update: The reflector I had purchased was being offered by a third party seller at that time. It now appears to be offered by Amazon itself, so the current item is probably the advertised 40"" Westscott."
5,Excellent delivery time,"I received the book before the estimated date (18 days before)despite it was an international ship (Lund, Sweden). Hence, I highly recommend this seller for future books. By the way, the book was in excellent conditions and it was the book that i had requested."
2,End ruined it....,"I will make my review short... and not so sweet. If it hadn't been for the last boss I would have given this game 5 stars.... but then comes Vaati. I don't mind that you have to get to him fast, I don't mind that he has a few forms.... what I mind is wasting time because if you die you start back at the beginning. People joke and say you waste time playing video games... this is supposed to be figuratively... not literally guys."
2,alright,"this was an alright game from nintendo. however i was disapointed with the graphics since ive seen other gba games that have better graphics than this like golden sun for example, and kingdom hearts. looking for a nice game go with chain of memories."
1,very confusing,"Reading the other reviews, this book is obviously either loved or hated, with no middle ground. I fall into the latter category. Reading a book should be a pleasure, not a task. The story jumps from 1952 to 1979 and 1989, without any logic. Worse, the characters are rather boring compared to other Phillips novels. Even more confusing, most of the book is told in third person, but sometimes changes to a character in first person. So, is the book about him? And the rest is background for him? I never did figure that out."
5,Whose Eye Is on Which Sparrow?,"I am not one that reads a lot, but this book is great I could not put it down."
2,"A good try to show te history, but not very objective approach","I'd recommend reading this book, but also reading the ones written by second and third parties."
1,Dead ON / Dead Off,This was the weakest set of bags I have ever had. They tore after 1 week.I haved used deathstick for some time and when i saw the belt i was excited to recieve it. But very dissapointed with the results. I went back to going to the store to get my bags.
1,Wacky World of Peafowl II,Too many references to Vol.I for the information. Reads like a childrens story.
1,Little insight into Springsteen's importance,"I picked this up thinking that the idea of looking at Bruce through the eyes of different Americans would be a unique perspective on Bruce's legacy. There is very little insight here, and the result is very disappointing. As someone who has been affected greatly and thought deeply about Bruce's music, I couldn't even finish reading it.Here are the criticisms of what I did read:* Superficial commentary on songs worthy of great comment* Very poor editing: I think Coles just transcribed his interviewees stories directly from tape without editing. It's like one big run-on sentence. It is choppy and totally unlyrical. Frankly, it hurts my eyes!* Some of the people aren't even Bruce fans. They are acquainted with Bruce fans or have observed the impact of Bruce on America without participating in it and experiencing it. It's like asking people in China to comment on what baseball means to America."
3,a great opening for a Barry Manillow concert,"A compliment coming from Barry's #2 fan (my mother being #1). When I saw him at Jones Beach this summer (and got to hang out with him back stage) I noticed I was the only female under 40 in the whole audience and my boyfriend was the only straight guy...the opening act was this amazing native brooklyn jazz quartet...'I Remeber You"" is fabulously arranged (like butta) and lacks completely any hook (so you're not left victim to some relentlessly unforgettable chorus)...what you are left with is a peaceful feeling from a stellar arangement and seemless voice...worth buying if you're like me or my mom or my ... roomate."
5,A must have for a fan of the Delorean.,My husband's dream has always been to own a real Delorean but of course I couldn't afford to buy him a real one for his birthday so this will have to do. It's not a real educational toy or something that you even play with. That's why I didn't give it five stars. But it does look good and my husband is sure to love part of his birthday gift. :)
4,Glazunov's best symphonies,"After Beethoven wrote his 9 symphonies, a host of other classical composers wrote 9 or fewer symphonies out of respect for Beethoven. Glazunov was one of them, as he wrote exactly 9 himself. His sixth is probably his most famous, followed by his 1st symphony. Both are ultimate expressions of the Romance period of classical music, as each is simple to hum, yet powerful in feel. Both of these classics are featured on this album. The music is great, the sound quality is flawless, but I would not purchase this CD for the amazon new price of $18+. Other albums featuring one or both works can be had for far cheaper."
3,Disappointed.,"""A Sea So Far"" had been on my ""to read"" list for many years, and once I got a hold of it, I was eager to read it. I thought I'd be reading more about the earthquake, but that was only the main event for the first few chapters. Thereafter, it was all about two young girls traveling to Ireland. I felt like I had been misled. I suppose for what the story was about, it was decent. I ""sorta"" recommend."
4,Good book on early campaign in desert,"This book focuses on the the first part of the desert war through Operation Crusader. It has an excellent account of the opening battles against the Italians, which were harder fought than generally thought. Told primarily from the British view, it does include a well balanced study of the German and Italian leaders and strategies. It touches on the campaigns in Easr Africa, Syria, Iraq and Greece/Crete to put the desert in context. Be warned, the author primarily interviewed the pro-Auchinlek crowd, and although there is little after Crusader, some bias does creep in. This is a very enjoyable book, and as an avid reader of the war's history i feel it to be one of the better accounts of the desert."
3,Moderate buy..,"While this book highlights the fundamentals of Kyokushinkai Karate, it could have provided more comprehensive diagrams for the Kata and the grading structure for moving through from Novice to Black Belt which is what the title of the book suggests. Nevertheless, this book is useful for the absolute beginner."
1,recibi producto equivocado,"Compre una freidora cuya foto aparece en la pagina web con la referencia T-fal Family Pro - Digital Deep Fryer (Digital Panel) Model No. FR4017002 y recibí la freidora familia pro acero inoxidable feidora de inmersion.Esto se debe a publicacion mal intencionada de amazon, para confundir al cliente, ya que de la freidora digital FR4017002 aparecen las fotografias en la misma publicidad de la freidora que me enviaron que no es digitalGracias"
4,Love this fryer!,"Finally purchased a deep fryer after many years of using a pan. I love the fryer. It is large, heats quickly and fries evenly. The design isn't perfectfor sure, but it does a great job."
5,Nice Gadget,"Good fryer for the money. Heats up in very little time. I made thin sliced fried potatoes just like my favorite Spanish Restaurant makes in Bayonne, NJ. Came out perfect the first time out."
4,Thought Provoking,This book is so thought provoking...I suggest every Christian read it if you're looking to find new ways to nourish your soul
5,Great first reader books,I found these books to be very fun and easy for my kindergartener to read. She brings home books like these from school but sometimes she has the same one for days. With these books it allows her to read something else so she is not getting bored. She really enjoys them.
5,One of my favorite books,"This is a book I can only call haunting. Wonderfully written and with an edgy tone that says history isn't black and white and has incidents that we'll never know about, it explores a time period you don't find in novels. This isn't the Roman Empire at its height conquering Britian and kicking butt. It's the slow slide of the end. I always liked De Hartog's character of Martinus Harinxma because he examins himself and his life without pity. This book links him to a centurion in the most original way I've ever seen in a story. I will never forget the hilarious and sad scene where the German tribes send an old dog in a Roman helmet as an insult to the Romans and how the Centurion, taking pity on the dog and his men, saves all of them-much to the incomprehension of the tribesmen. Even in his serious stories, De Hartog injects humor and surprise that are always believable since life is full of such things. A terrific and unusual book."
5,Great Bible,I am very pleased with this Bible. A wonderful translation and the highest of quality. The leather is the best I've seen.
1,"Sorry, no such person as ""Keith Douglass""...","This series started off really awsome, but kind of wore down after a while. Unfortunately, ""Keith Douglass"" is a name owned by the publisher. The novels were all ghost written! William Keith Jr. wrote the first seven, in my opinion the best in the series and definately worth checking out, but after that the series went down hill and I gave up after book 12. My advice, if you have a choice go back and re-read the first seven books."
1,Presto! It's broken!,"Owned this skillet for 1 month when 1 of the legs broke off the handle. Contacted Presto and found that the plastic parts are not covered under a warantee but they would gladly sell me a new piece for $9 plus shipping. Not happy! Wrote a letter to the company. No reply! Tried to super glue, hot glue, heat weld the pieces back together with no luck. Plain and simple, don't trust a company that doesn't stand behind their products! Pay a little more, buy a Cuisinart, be satisfied. They stand behind their products."
2,"Legendary Flutist, Vol. 1","Kincaid's performance was quite disappointing--out of tune, slipshod technique. The Chaminade was incomplete."
2,I was left feeling like she cut out pieces of the story.,"I was really looking forward to this book and was not ""satisfied"". The short stories were actually so short they didn't ""pull"" me in. I am not really sure what all the hype is about. Skip it."
3,not their best,"I have listened to every era ABB and though the lineup here is one of my favorites, the recording isn't. Though average Allmans is better than most other bands . You can do better than this. For the collectors only. I am amazed this is all they could come up with after have many night to pick from. Dickey might not have been hitting the note on this one as they claim, but he is back in form now. saw him live twice in 06 and he has lots to offer. He needs to put out an album with his current lineup IMO the best he has had outside the Allmans."
4,Excellent Playing......about the sound,"This sounds like an analgue recording from the 1960s. It does not have the clarity (and in some cases the sterile sound of more recent live albums which is a good thing). This actually has a warmer sound than many clear digital recordings - kind of like some of the early 1960's Dick's Picks Grateful Dead releases). Supprising is that this was recorded in 2000. Was it poor recording equipment or are they trying to get a more 60's sound on this. Therefore, I think the only major flaw is a 10 minute drum solo in High Falls- OK to see but never good to hear. Drum solos should be hot and no longer than about 2 minutes - great drummers like Buddy Rich knew this well. Hit the stop button at the 11 minute mark of High Falls to avoid drum overload."
4,Amico,"I found Amico to be a good company to deal with. They had inadvertently sent me an ""Anti-static Pad"", instead of the""Anti-static Wrist strap"". They volunteered to send me the ""Anti-Static Wrist strap"", for free.Nice Company, I'll buy from them in the future."
1,such a waste of time,"Im so surprised to find this game on amazon. I stumbled across it years ago, and I thought it might part of the shining force series(the bad guys name is darksol, from sf1) so I played it... played it all the way to the end. Geezus what a waste of time! I got angrier and angrier the longer I played, but im a die hard so I kept going...Look there just isnt much in this game. Its more primitive, in my opinion, than the original dragon warrior. which I would have thought was hard to do. At one point you can find some kind of special metals and have a blacksmith forge some unique items but that is the limit of its complexity. Its just one dungeon, cant remember how many levels, but such a small universe and... man its REALLY boring. Its not worth 50 cents. dont play it. Im warning everyone off because I see myself as a conciencious member of society and one of the things social animals do is try to keep each other from making bad decisions."
1,Aweful,"Wow, what a train wreck. I could get through half of this DVD. Don't waste your money. Miss Richfield is usually funny, but OMG."
5,Happy to find this again.,Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer makes my lips feel great and Nutmeg is the perfect color for me. I like the thin size of it which is much easier to use then the fatter tubes. I prefer Burt's Bees to lipstick because if it smear it is easy to wipe off. I was delighted to find this product and color on Amazon.com.
1,"Terrible Ghosting, Cheap and Paper Thin","I received this product today at around 3:30PM. By 5:15PM it was repackaged and shipped back to Amazon.com.Do not trust the overall 4.5 score. This bible was huge (not a bad thing), with onion thin paper, extremely dark text and 90% ghosting. I could read the scriptures from the opposite side of the page, it was so dark and distracting and the paper was terribly thin. The Genuine Leather bonding felt like imitation leather. Stiff and grainy and paper like.I was thoroughly disappointed after waiting 8 days for this shipment to arrive. I finally went to a local bible store and picked up a decent bible for 8 more bucks. NASB Large Print, Bonded Leather, Thin Line Zondervan Bible. 100% better!DON'T BUT THIS BIBLE."
5,Great pick,"This is a good quality product. The letters are large and easy to read. It has a good concordance and the maps are excellent. This Bible also includes an overview of each book, located between the concordance and the maps. Footnotes are minimal. I am well pleased with my purchase and enjoy using this Bible."
1,"So angry, but can't resist any more...","I appreciate the warnings from everyone and very much admire those of you who refuse to buy the dvds until they can be true to the series. I've tried to be one of you, but I cannot deny myself the Ken Wahl any longer. I am so ashamed of my weakness, curses to the corporate machine... and to the rest of you; Stay strong!"
4,Shame about the missing arc but........,"Still great value. Amazing characters frank and vinnie love you guys,really good writing.this set is in great demand among my friends...."
2,two corrupt discs,"while for the most part the series is ok except for a couple that had NO wiseguy theme, rather had turned to psychobabble and girly - expressing feelings, romance etc.but the worse was paying for 13 dvd's and getting two that were corrupt an not viewable...the last two. perhaps just a fluke, the recording gear went snafu on the last two..who knows. still it is not good to happen.i was expecting 'godfather-wiseguy' action thruout, each and every, not some foo-foo girls night out club deal on some episodes."
1,It's Sad! Avoid!,"I will not endorse Hollywood's nickel and diming of its fans, no matter how tempting this set may be. I would pay double the listed price for the fully restored series with the music. But without the Dead Dog arc and the music, this is just a sad shell of what was. It's a shame because Wiseguy is a perfect example of how great TV used to be, but you wouldn't know that from watching these DVDs. When Season One aired, I knew someone who cried during Nights In White Satin. Without the music, much of the impact is lost. It's just a shame, no other way to put it. Save your money and hope for syndication."
4,Perfect for Filing my Dog's Nails,"My dog (boxer/lab) absolutely refused to let me cut his nails. After only a few sessions with the Minimite (with a treat after each nail), he happily plops down and hands me his paw. It might be a bit better if it worked more quickly on the low speed, but maybe I need a coarser filing drum."
4,A REAL WORKER,"I bought one of these tools, when it first hit the street.Man was I surprised with the power. After about 2 years of serious duty I finally wore it out.The only down side was not being able to precisely control the speed.You cant go wrong here folks dremel has built a reputation on simplicity and reliability.This minimite is no exception and is definitely tool box worthy. Now get out there and grind,cut,polish something."
1,Not as advertised,Instead of Dremil 750-02 Lithium cordless tool I was sent the 750-1 Dremil tool using NiCad batteries. I needed the tool so I am stuck with it. A sloppy way of doing business.
4,Nice replacement for older models.,"I had a older model cordless Dremel. The battery pack finally gave up the ghost, and I decided to get myself a new dremel. Looking around I found this one, I amm usually skeptical unless I can hold it. Well I had some plastic models that were crying for attention, so I bought this model.I was pleased with the new grip, and had no issues with the control like some others. It ran a bit faster than the old model, but that could be because I was used to the dying battery pack. Be careful if you are using this on plastics that could burn under high speed grinding.The tool did what it was supposed to do, and it does it well. Those who cling to comfortable old tools have nothing to fear with this upgrade."
5,Great tool for nail grinding,"We use these in our grooming salon and they are really great.They are light weight so don't kill your hands, but powerful enough to get the job done.I will say, their battery life is a *little* on the weak side, but not bad enough for me to buy a different model for my own home use. You can do several small dogs with one charge, but if you're having to remove a fair amount of length from the toenails of a normal sized dog it does drain kind of quickly. In these cases, it's better to trim some of the excess nail off before grinding. If you are planning on multiple large dogs, or a bigger project, I would recommend picking up a spare battery.Despite popular belief, it IS possible to quick a dog with these (and any other tool that shortens the nails, including pedipaws...), and the heat does NOT cauterize it, so if you aren't good with figuring out where the quick ends, be sure to keep some quik stop handy."
4,Dremel Minimite (Cordless) Rotary Tool,"I belong to a wood carving group and electrical power outlets are limited in the assigned room. So, the Dremel 750-02 Minimite Rotary Tool is ideal for its portability.It is easy to use for sanding,cutting and other wood carving techniques.I would highly recommend purchasing an additional 4.8 volt rechargable battery for back-up purposes when working for extended periods of time on a project.Neil Hays"
4,Pretty good little tool.,"The Dremel is great for sharpening chainsaws, very quick and easy to get use to. The only draw back with the Minimite is that for 3 hours charge you only get 20 minutes of use in the high speed mode."
3,not good for dogs,"Quite a few reviewers suggested this is a good one to polish dog nails instead of clipping them. But I found out otherwise. The thing generates a lot of heat when working, and the sound scares dogs away."
3,"Nice Portable, short battery life","This is a nice, light cordless tool, but the battery life leaves a little to be desired. At high speed I could only get about 10 minutes of moderate grinding done before requiring a recharge."
3,Not Lithium but ok,I have used this product and love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the batteries are not Lithium as advertised.
5,Dremel Battery - Great value!,I bought this battery as a replacement for an old one. It is a really good price for a good battery.
5,Excellent game with a different concept,"Zertz is one of those 2-player games that is simple (and I mean simple) to learn, but very strategic and engaging. I've had it on the shelf for months, finally pulled it down, and we haven't stopped playing.It is played on a hex-shaped checker board. Players jump and capture pieces, but you are both playing with the same pieces. In the meantime, the board shrinks as you remove spots. You can win by having 3 of each of the three colors, or 4, 5 or 6 of one particular color, which means that your strategy can change during play in response to conditions and opportunities. This is a classic. I just can't say enough about it."
5,One of The Most Great Songs ever produced next to Nirvana,"It was the most amazing thing i've ever heard, i was one of those people who hated spice girls and every one of them but i'll tell u now that this album will change your views...not only her music has grown more mature,sensible and pleasant but she herself has also changed in looks and attitude. She looks much more sexier,purer, and more mature and the music seems to reflect that a lot...its clear that leaving the spice girls was one of the smartest choices she has made and from the looks of it it will definately be better than Spice Girls new album."
4,Mighty God,This is an awesome CD that never lets you forget just how mighty our God is. I could listen to this one over and over and have already. This is another gem that has long been out of print (1989). Try your best to get your hands on this one if you can. This is true praise and worship at best. This is one of my favorite CDs.
5,Hehe,"This movie cracked me up. Especially the ending. It was unusual and interesting and I loved it. ^.^ I only watched it because I knew Toby was in it, but it was a really great movie. Funny in a way that is not so overdone. The main character was a true jerk, through and through, and I loved him for it. Definitely watch it, just because it's so...different. In a good way."
1,NOTHING like the REAL Maggi!!!!!!,"I fell in love with Maggi seasoning while in Switzerland - I brought home a bottle and became addicted! I was excited to see it available in the States, but when the seasoning arrived, I was turned off by the ""chemically"" smell and taste! It doesn't taste anything close to the real deal. I still have a bit left of the original I had purchased in Switzerland, so I did a taste comparison - there is no doubt that what is available in America is NOT what you can get in Europe. Like the Maggi you can get in Europe (which is produced by Nestle), this version is also supposedly produced by Nestle, but UNLIKE the stuff you get in Europe (which is manufactured in Germany), this ""Maggi"" is produced in CHINA. And it tastes like it - the chemical taste and aroma is so overwhelming, I think I just have to throw out the two bottles I ordered! Total bummer! If you love Maggi, find an importer of German products rather than try and buy this version..."
3,Just a sampler,"This is a sampler of individual movies you can buy I believe. For the reviewer that commented on the panning fireplace video, the actual Blu-ray disk has four different fires, one continual, one from match lighting to dying embers, a smaller romantic fire and, lastly, the one that appears to be sampled here where the view pans and zooms giving you the ""best angles and shots"".Fireplace: Visions of Tranquility [Blu-ray]"
3,Not what I expected but it was <$10,I thought there was going to be an option to turn off the music especially when watching the fireplace scene. The music gets quite annoying when you just want to relax and hear the fire burning. I have a HD-A30 with firmware 1.3 had no issues playing this HD-DVD. I would reccomend this for the price.
3,H D SAMPLER,VERY GOOD PURCHASE FOR THE PRICE EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A FULL LENGHT MOVIE STILL SERVES THE PURPOSE OF CHECKING OR DISPLAYING THE VIDEO & AUDIO QUALITY OF YOUR SYSTEM
5,Clear your mind: clear your closet,"I'm glad to see that copies of this book are again available. The reason this book rocks is that the authors really want you to think about why you dress the way you do. What draws you toward certain articles of clothing? ""What do you keep buying and wearing?"" they ask. They stress that ""promiscuous buying"" results from a lack of focus. And you might have nothing to wear because you have 50 tops and no bottoms that flatter you. I re-read this book every year or so, to see if what I'm putting on the outside of my body reflects what's going on inside. It's not touchy-feely either; these gals are hardcore and they tell you up front that what they advocate you do is simple, but not easy. They encourage discipline and enlightenment, really helping you clear your mind and heart while clearing out your closet. May not resonate with everyone, but it sure worked for me!"
4,Flem,The CD was in good condition. This is one of my favorites! I like the price for the quality of the CD. Very pleased! I will be ordering more. Ordered arrived on time.Jesus Is Alive: Hosanna Music Praise Worship
1,Poorly written,"This is one of the very few books which I returned for refund.The subject is intrinsicly interesting, and there is a need for a serious introductory text addressing the subject of geometry and physics. This one badly falls short, - carelessly written, with numerous irrelevant asides. She seems even to fail to realize that there exist three distinct geometric solutions to the Kepler problem. The bound, elliptic case is only one.This book has supposedly been written for high-undergraduate students or early-year graduate students. It serves neither adequately."
3,Core Tibetan Buddhism,"First off, I was disappointed when I opened the book and found every page muddled with pink marker (which I don't recall being noted in the description). I think the seller should have been a little more precise when they stated the book was ""used"".Besides that I enjoyed reading the book. I learned more about this path of philosophy and some different ways to look at my life and learn from my experiences. It was a good addition to my collection of philosophical texts."
2,"Fantastic prose, not-so-great recipes.","I was quite pleased to receive this cookbook as a gift, but disappointed once I started cooking the recipes. Mr. Bourdain's talents as a writer are not to be denied, but it must be said that these recipes are a bit anemic and wanting. While I definitely appreciate his passion for good food, that passion doesn't seem to extend into making the actual food himself. Which is totally fine -- Bourdain's advocacy for top-quality cuisine is definitely appreciated -- but it means I'll look elsewhere for the nuts and bolts of good recipes."
5,Great Recipes..... easy to make.... In your own language,The book contains classic recipes from the french cuisine that for us amateurs turns into great dishes.The language he uses is extremely easy and specially cause he remembers taht none of us is aware of measuring ingredients into the correct ounces or grams etc..
5,hysterical cook book!,"I have a decent sized collection of cookbooks, many of which I've read as if they were novels. This cookbook makes me laugh out loud! I have not prepared any recipes yet. I purchased the book to widen my collection (didn't have French - too intimidating and Julia Child's didn't appeal to me as a home cook). Anthony's irreverent sense of humor makes me want to keep turning the pages to see what outrageous comment he'll make next. If you like his show and enjoy cooking - you'll love this book. I plan to purchase more of the writings of this talented bad boy."
1,"Review of Amazon, not Dixie Chicks","Amazon.com really blew it on this one. They sent me the wrong CD twice. I should have known ""Thank Heavens for Dale Evans"" wasn't readily available. Someone in the inventory department is messing up.BTW, I LOVE THE DIXIE CHICKS!"
1,Creepy and boring,"My son is obsessed with dinosaurs, but not only does he never pick up this particular book (because all of the dinosaur pictures are weird looking and boring) but I actually had to black-out the face of one of them because it was so freaky looking. It seriously even creeped me out a little bit. They look like they were shaped out of clay and sprayed with pam. Overall just not a favorite in this dinosaur-loving household."
2,dinosaur book- too simple,I am not so impressed with this book. the pictures are not colourful enough for the children. the names are a mouthful!
5,Perfect book for a 2 yr old that loves dinosaurs,My 2 yr old twin grandson loved this book and has it with him constantly. It is perfect for the young reader.
5,Dinos galore!,"If you know a kid who is crazy about dinosaurs, this book is for you! I bought it for my 4-year-old nephew who LOVES dinosaurs and he couldn't get enough of this book. It has all the usual dinosaurs that kids learn about, along with a bunch of new ones."
1,Really??,"$16.99 for the Kindle Edition of this book?! Little much, dontcha think? Gotta love the greedy publishers."
4,Great hardcover book for the price,"I was thrilled with the price for an ""almost"" new hardcover book. This was one of my monthly book club's selections. I enjoyed the book - light fare. Though I think the author, being young and single and on a roadtrip looking for pie, could have brought even more humor into her writing. It was a bit dry and long winded at times. Anthony Bourdain fans, this is probably not for you... it's sweet as pie. The book had a very eloquent ending."
5,It kept me awake all night,"Using this book, I learned the basics of competitive speaking and got an ""A"" in my speech class. I highly recommend this book to any high school student who wants to do well in a forensics class."
5,Out if Eden ROCKS!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE this c.d!!!!!!!!! There music is a real blessing. My favorate is Draw you near! There all 3 great singers!!! If I could, i would rate them 100 stars!!!!! Thats how good they are!"
1,If only it would get here,"I'd love to say how the product works but it has not arrived !!!It has been on order since Nov 16,2004 and you still say you can get 1 day delivery or usually ships in 24 hours !!! Now I do not have a Christmas present for my husband and I thought I ordered it in PLENTY OF TIME !!!!update: today is 12-30-04. It says my order shipped on 12-21 but UPS says they never got it. I am cancelling this order and returning the items I did get. I am so dissapointed."
1,Good Saw - Bad Motor,"Bought this tool over a year ago but only used it for a total of about 30 hours before the motor ""burned out"". The tool is solidly built, blade changes are easy, and overall I was quite happy with all aspects of the tool until, of course the motor went. Called the Dremel people, it's out of warranty and to get it fixed is cost prohibitive so I'll have to buy a new saw. If I had confidence that this event was a fluke I would buy another Dremel 1680, but another reviewer had a burned out motor with very little time on the saw. It's a shame because other than the motor this 4 star tool, alas a great saw with no motor is a $149.00 paper weight. I think I have to drop 3 bills on a Dewalt 20""."
1,Too basic,"This book is too basic. I bought it because of the good reviews. If you are looking for clear cut instructions and variety of good restorative poses, try Health through Yoga by Mira Metha.For more active sequences, best resources are Light on Yoga ad Yoga - The Iyengar Way"
5,New Yogi,"Judith Lasater's book is about the type of yoga I was longing for, so I bought the book and commenced to teach myself. Restorative yoga is a wonderful art and Lasater's book covers the practice in the most thorough comprehensive way. There are suggestions for creating your own props from household blankets, pillows, etc. pictures, cautions, benefits. A treasure. Even better, I have since found a studio that offers this type of yoga on a regular basis, and my book is always here forfurther learning, enjoyment, and reference. One of my best purchases from Amazon."
3,rockin' gospel,"the album is a fresh delight with some surprisingly good ""duets"" on board. I suggest you listen to it in the car..."
2,Disappointed,"Strangely written Q&A; style book. I little bit of insight in the beginning, but not a very deep book, nor is it very helpful in practice.Some of the topics in the index sound interesting. They are a disappointment."
3,Silvertone Guitar,"This is my second purchase of an acoustic guitar. The guitar is alright nothing special, but two days after I purchased it amazon had it $20.00 cheaper. I contacted them about getting a credit on the difference but they said no. Oh well live and learn"
4,10000-20000 rpm only,"I love this tool and use it a lot. Contrary to other people, I am able to use the tool for a good hour before the battery starts dwindling.I just wanted to point out that the shipping units have two fixed speeds 10000 or 20000 rpm. It does not have 5000 or any other number as suggested by the specifications on this product page. That is a big flaw in my opinion, as you can only select between two rather high RPMs. I use the tool to polish things, and even at the lower 10000rpm setting, the tool is too fast and generates lots of heat.I need to go get a 5000RPM version, so I wish i bought the more expensive Li-Ion unit which has variable speed down to 5000 rpm. :("
3,First time Dremel user,"I thought the sanding piece would dull my dogs' nail alot faster. I have to use it for 10-15 seconds to get a smooth, short nail. And for my hyper dog, that is a long time to be still. And it is alot louder than I had thought. It sure takes alot of treats and coaxing to get her use to the dremel.Overall, I think it is less stressful and probably safer to use than cutting the nail, but there are a few downsides."
3,A poor long term choice,"While the capabilities of all Dremel products are excellent, this suffers from poor battery life. Mine lasted less than 40 hours of use, and replacements are not available from retailers such as Lowes and Home Depot. With replacements batteries at Amazon for $20 or direct from the manufacturer at $25, unless you really, really need a cordless, spend the extra money up front and go for a 300 series. You will soon recoup the extra cost."
3,"Great, when it works","I bought this Dremel to trim my two Bulldogs nails and it's great when it works. However, I've had it just over a month and am sending it back to Dremel for the second time. The battery pack just won't stay in place and I need two hands to operate the thing; very hard to do when one hand needs to hold a dog paw steady. Dremel customer service has been great, very friendly and going the extra mile to fix it, but I wish I would have returned it to Amazon within the 30 day window so I could buy a corded option or at least get a different model. If you're looking at this for my same purpose, it works great, 3-4 seconds to trim each nail, but be prepared to duck tape the battery pack in place."
5,Great for dog nail grinding,"I am a professional dog groomer at a PetSmart grooming salon. We use this 7.2volt dremel to grind dogs nails. It is the best dremel out there! We used to use the Oster corded grinder, which works amazing too, but this one is so much easier because its cordless. Just be sure to charge each night and you are ready to go for the day! Its amazingly powerful and works great if you know how to use it!"
1,Very Unhappy,"I'm not sure what was wrong with this DVD but it wouldn't play at all. I meant to tell the sender and send it back for a refund but I didn't and forgot about it. If you buy a DVD from here, make sure it works when you receive it."
2,Constantly Interrupted Television Comedy,I love Wanda! She's funny in this show but I could not enjoy it due to the fact that there are FREQUENT commercial breaks (sans the ads). This is a TV program taped for Comedy Central---NOT a full length comedy performance. Just when I settled in and became really interested they'd have another break. Just fair warning for all you potential buyers....
3,Cool animations could have made a great album better,"Sure, the liner notes are cool, the images are awesome, but I agree with the above review, put them all together, watching wallpaper change?This could have been an amazing multimedia experience, instead it almost like a ""This is Spinal Tap"" rip-off of a band trying to poke fun at Beatle-esque Sgt.Pepper movies...I have made more interesting videos on my Win-Amp visualizer!I was anticipating this DVD with much enthusiasm, however I am very disappointed...buy the cd instead...and avoid this DVD, the 3 stars is only because I think the drawings are original and interesting..."
3,Good for PCB drilling,"I bought this attachment for drilling 0.7mm holes on printed circuit boards. It had a little side-play, but rotating the height guide eliminated the problem. I use it with a Black & Decker RTX (yes, it works if you replace the top holding screw with a longer one and force the holding ring a little bit) and the Dremel multi-chuck for holding such small drill bits, and it works great.I couldn't imagine using a standard 10"" drill press with a 1/2"" chuck along with 0.7mm (less than 1/32"") drill bits, and the drill press adapters for conventional hand drills had WAY too much play."
2,inaccurate alignment,"Wobbly attachment,and no way to align bit to true 90deg. make this usless for anything but the crudest results.Don't expect good results.Dremel should take this piece of c.. off the market until they can refine the design and make this worthy of their name."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I got this as a Christmas present, and just now used it for the first time to engrave my cellphone. I had been wondering how easy it would be to control, but am glad to report that the result was as small & legible as what can be achieved with pen and paper."
3,Good,"It looks perfect, make a little noise but is good... I have used it on wood and it does what it says but still needed something better but for the price it is great"
5,Engraver,Great item and super price but there needs to be a little indicator where the tip is located in the packaging as i almost couldn't find it and almost threw it away.
3,losing the screw,"I purchased two of the Dremel Engravers. I have used Dremel tools for years and have never been disappointed, this time is different. The screw that holds the engraving tip is so short and difficult to screw in or out that I have dropped it several times. The thread depth is two short to allow the threaded screw to get a good hold. And the tip I really need is for glass and while the one provided is passable for a few times it will not be servicable for the long term for the glass I engrave. Over all I am disappointed and would like a better solution for the engraving I need to do. JM"
1,How the heck are you supposed to tighten the screw?!,"My girlfriend purchased this engraver for me right before we moved 2 months ago. I've been very excited to engrave glasses and finally found time to use it tonight. HOW THE HECK ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIND A FLAT HEAD SMALL ENOUGH TO ADJUST THE SCREW? I have TWO tool boxes, tried tweezers, a ulti key even, other household items, NOTHING. A tool should have been included to adjust the screw or the design should have been different. This experince was ridiculous and very disappointing. Would return the engraver if I could. the engraver was purchased under emilycannon86"
2,Dremel Engraver,Can't really say how the product itself works becuase I couldn't use it. It arrived without any bit and you can't get the bit needed at Lowes or Home depot. They are available on line only!! That should have been mentioned somewhere.
4,Great Engraver,for the price this is an excellent product. Definitely lives up to the Dremel BRAND. It makes it easy to add my name to my metal art projects. The Letter stencil is a bit awkward but that is not the reason I purchased this.
1,Dremel table,"A little flimsy,even when mounted to a 2x4. Good for work that does not require precision. Would not but again.Dremel does not mount in the device firmly and seems cheap. Plastic. Not a good value. Would not buy again."
5,Dremel 231 Shaper/Router Table,This was exactly what I needed for my Dremel tool. I couldn't find it locally anywhere and needed it fast. It came the next day after I ordered.
4,Great accessory but not absolutely perfect.,"I got this some time ago and use it with the 400 XPR (adapter necessary). I have used it mostly for edging. Works great for edging.It lacks in performance for routing out keyholes and slots. Slots I found it necessary to do them a little at a time; start at a low depth and after each sweep raise the depth of the cut a little more until you have the depth you want.As for keyholes, just about forget it; it's too jumpy. I use another tool I have for keyholes."
5,Router Table,I have only used this tool one time so far but it worked well. A 4 sided table would be more portable that finding a place to fasten it to. But I am glad I have it!
1,Complicated and suspicious..,"This book, while written in a clear and logical manner, reminded me to much of some sort of conspiracy theory novel to be enjoyed. Too much talk of powerful lobbies and mass cover-ups.The author seems to combine many smaller, poorly verified pieces of evidence to combat larger, well accepted blocks of evidence found in western archives. Also, he seems to skip a few of the more prominent pieces of evidence used by historians when defining the event as genocide.Ultimately, the book closely paralleled an article I once read written by a Palestinian man claiming less than 2 million Jews died in the Holocaust and that Zyklon B was never used to kill them.While it was written intelligently, it hardly seemed unbiased."
1,DEFINITION OF GENOCIDE,"In 1943 and at the UN, Raphael Lempkin, a holocaust survivor who lost 48 family members, coined the term genocide. When asked about an example or a definition he used the extermination of 1.5 million armenians at the turn of the century at the hands of turks in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.MEANING : GENOCIDE (as described by the person who invented that word) = SLAUGHTERED ARMENIANS BY OTTOMAN TURKS.One should expect that any historian dealing with this subject would respect that definition for what it stands for. Mr Lewy failed in this regard."
1,open minded?,"Cookiedough(rewier below)accuses reviewers who have opinions different from official Turkish view as being close minded. In light of this accusation you should read his review of ""Burning Tigris"" it appears that to him the definition of open mindedness is agreeing with his point of view."
2,Activists Stay Away,"John Dicker's book is largely a rehash of materials patched together elsewhere, and even the title is taken from a far more compelling book, Al Norman's ""The Case Against Wal-Mart."" This book will disappoint activists who want information about how to deal with the social and cultural destruction created by big box retailers. Dicker seems to be disengaged behind his computer, unruffled by the turmoil going on in small town America, and clueless about what to do about it. For a better read on what Wal-Mart means, and how citizens can confront them at the local level, get a copy of ""Slam Dunking Wal-Mart"" or ""The Case Against Wal-Mart."" If you just want some history about the giant retailer, get Bob Ortega's book about Wal-Mart. It seems to be getting trendy to write armchair critiques about Wal-Mart, with several academics holding forth on the wrack and ruin of Wal-Mart. But this book seems to be an idle romp by an author who brings no real political vision to what he is writing."
2,VERY small - good for a note card or two...,"I wound up sending this back. The dimensions aren't listed - Don't be fooled by the picture, you can't hold anything larger than a note card on here. The seller was great about it though. I marked it as 2 stars because I really don't know how much use this would be..."
5,"Successful author, successful book, great ideas","I saw this book reviewed here on Amazon. I then went to the public library to review one of his other books. I liked what I saw. Then I bought this book based on the previous reviews and I'm very glad I did. It's definitely worth a 5 out of 5!This book hits the sweet spot of what I'm trying to accomplish as a tutor to some junior high school students. Barry Lane's exercises and theories fit what I've learned so far in this fun, and sometimes hilarious, quest.The book is easy to read, yet loaded with useful advice. Now that I've finished this book, I'll be getting his other books and most importantly: I'll be starting to implement his recommendations on teaching writing to children.The author is a writing in instructor in New Hampshire/Vermont. The book has a useful bibliography and he often comments on important books throughout his chapters.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
4,Not a true dance mat but fun,This is a fun toy but not a dance mat as previously posted which was a bit of a disappointed as my little one loves to dance. Wish I would have read the reviews first.
3,Burn Some Calories!,"The Wiggles Dance mat has everything a parent wants in a game... and everything a kid could want!- loud bouncy music from their favorite T.V. show for the kid, kid getting exercise for mom, bright colors and fun pictures for kid, educational and stimulating for mom. The Wiggles Dance mat is great fun and young kids will love bouncing around to the music... for about ten minutes. The only problem with this product is that young children who have low attention spans don't like using it for a long period of time because lets face it... jumping around gets rather boring after a while! It is lost of fun though and a great rainy day activity that will get your kids up off the couch. It is a great toy for two or three kids and they'll have a blast! This is a great gift idea for any Wiggles fan and tons of fun for parties and play dates."
1,Just because it has the Wiggles name...,"...doesn't make it a great toy. A lesson learned the hard way. This toy is unbelievably loud. So loud, my husband and I can't stand to be in the same room with our son when he's dancing (stomping) on it. So ridiculously loud, my son can't play with this toy inside at all anymore. Every time he moves, the songs start over. Grates on your nerves after the 5th or 6th stomp. What a disappointing toy. We've had it out of the box three or four times to play with. It is now hidden in the deepest darkest part of the hall closet until we make our next round of donations to Good Will. Save your money for one of the other good dance mat toys on the market. This one's a stinker."
1,Junk....,"I mean this attachment works fine and all, but do not expect it to sharpen your chain properly. First, the instructions are WRONG on how to use it (as others have duly noted)!!! Second , if you cut much at all... you will soon see the bannana effect. Waste of money...my fault!!! Back to the old hand files for me!!!"
3,Don't use the included grinding stones,"The attachment works fine, but use the included grinding stones for something else. Don't buy Dremel chain saw stone either. They wear too fast and will mess up the cutters on your chain. Go to a saw shop and buy some diamond grinders for your chain size. I bought Stihl grinders for just over a buck each. Toss them after about a half dozen uses.I think a file and guide yields a better result. I use a file in the woods. But for quickly bringing all cutters to the same length, setting the depth gauge etc., you can't beat an electric. Just be patient so you don't mess up the chain."
5,Quicker than the hand file,"Much quicker than the hand file method. It's pretty idiot proof, just follow the angle on the plate the same as you would with a hand file. Anything that makes maintenance easier is a win in my book, since I'm more inclined to keep my chainsaw sharp, which is a benefit when using it."
5,3LW's Debut,"I remember this album when I was in the 8th grade. I remember the first single,No More,which was the jam. Their music is a distinctive blend of pop,R&B; and hip-hop, right on time and totally in tune with contemporary trends. Their vocal harmonies sparkle,and their rhymes flow with wit and eloquence. Their background reflects the growing diversity of their country as it enters the new century. They are street-savvy,intelligent, into new technology-the teenage girls of the new millennium.This album has been certified Platinum. Remember,this was 2000-2001."
5,AWSOME CD!!,"This is a GREAT cd! You won't regret bying it, this is one of my favorite cds! This cd has hot lyrics and music! It makes your wanna get up and dance!"
4,a teens review on 3lw,"I think 3lw is alright.Their lyrics are cute.I especially like the beats and rhythem.The songs about boys are sweet.Though 3lw uses some bad language they are alright.I would recommend this cd to anyone who want to hear some up beat music in the hip hop culture.Oh and Keily if you are reading this,let Naturi stay in the group.3lw wont be the same without her."
3,Its a whatever,"This is my 2nd one. First one last me about 5 years. Worked great untell drive cable snapped. This new one 2nd time using it at high rpms it has a shimmy to it,like they used cheap bearing in it. I dunno maybe I just got a bum one?"
2,Dremel Flex Shaft Attachment,"I've not really had very much luck trying to use this attachment on my Dremel. The inner drive portion seems to shift and come ""out"" during usage so I have to play with it a lot. Very frustrating and seems like the design could be better. I also wish the end of the tool were flexible allowing adjustment to 90 degrees. Seems like Dremel has the market cornered for having to buy special attachments when they could design one that would do the majority without having to constantly change pieces. I'm sure in their mind it's a good thing because we keep buying attachments to do the projects we need to do and it means big $$$$'s for them. Overall, my son could have designed a better attachment and am extremely disappointed in the quality / performance this tool provides."
1,IT WAS A BORING AND DULL BOOK!,It was not very intersting at all . A five year old could read it and it would be boring to them. Instead of having it recommended for 7th graders it should be for a 5th grader. We are to advansed for that book.
2,No survival guide,"I couldn't wait to receive this book in the mail. Finally a professional approach to a chronic world-wide issue! Well, I was disappointed. Tons of 'testimonies,' tons of support but alas no advice. Nothing most daughters-in-law don't already know anyway.For example, one of the main reasons I bought the book was because it touched on unsupportive husbands. However, what does it say about unsupportive husbands? That they should support their wives. That's it, period amen. No advice for those whose husbands refuse. No alternative suggestions.I'll tell you what, I know exactly the same thing I knew before I purchased the book. If you're a professional and can offer sound advice and suggestions, please do us a favor and write a book or something. You'll hit the jackpot...gauranteed."
5,Handy Catch Phrases,"Both this and Tails Are Not For Pulling offer nice pictures, easy text for toddlers, and handy catch phrases which parents can use to remind kids of what they should and shouldn't be doing. This title makes hand washing fun and shows kids to cough into their elbows. Great idea!"
3,Is not in color!,"This books is misleading, the pictures are not in color, they are black and white so is not very interesting for kids. Not worth the price at all."
5,A hit with my 2-year old,"Bought this and several other books in this series for my daughter when she recently turned two. This one and ""Bye-Bye Time"" are her favorites. She asks me to read them over and over again every night before bed. She repeats the phrases, such as, ""Tissue please!,"" however, I'm not sure she's really old enough to understand the concept of germs yet. These are great books for ages 2 and 3."
5,"""Out of this world!"" says Tumba","After I read and looked through this outstanding quiltbook, I found that everytime I have a free minute, I'm sewing. My mom loves to sew and quilt, so we added a room just for quilting onto our house. Since this inspirational book came out, I've made many aplique and patchwork quilts(my mom even bought a quilter!). This book alone has changed the way we live. We relax more by taking time off to sew and quilt, it's made our home cozier and more colorful, and when we have company, we have something to show them! This woman is so talented it isn't even funny! I think if America was full of poeple like LaQuita and Howard Bynum, life would be carefree and so much more enjoyable. I thank God for making good poeple like them who will share with the world the things they love.Sincerely, Tumba B. Tractor"
4,Very nice pack,"I gave this product four stars because I really believe that there should be at least one outer pocket for extra batteries, flash cards, pens etc. Other then that this is my second Lowepro camera bag (I out grew the first one) and it handles my 400mm L lens and six other lenses not to mention my camera and all the extras you need for nature photography."
5,Great buy,I've been waiting years to find this somewhere until one of my friends told me to check amazon and there it was
4,Consider waiting for the Extended Edition,"This is the latest DVD trend that annoys me: They will release this version now and then, later, release the ""Platinum Extended Edition"" which is likely the one you'll really want.This version is what you saw in the theater along with some nice extras, however if you wait for the ""Platinum Extended Edition"" you'll get extra footage integrated into the movie and even more extras. I made the mistake of buying the first release of The Fellowship of the Ring only to rebuy it in the form of the Platinum Extended Edition later and won't make that same mistake again.Let my mistake serve as a warning to others: consider waiting for the better edition coming out later! (Fellowship and Two Towers extended versions came out in Nov '02 and Nov '03, so I anticipate Nov '04 for ROTK. It's a wait that'll save you some cash -- unless you really want to own two versions of the same movie.)"
2,lord of Booooaring!,"I smuggled a bottle of champagne into the cinema when I went to see this...even that couldn't liven it up...I fell asleep for 1/2 an hour...asked what happened; ""the orcs blah dwarfs blaah gandol"" zzzz I was asleep again.Tedious. And the DVD has EXTRAS!!!The bloody ending was pase 2000 years ago!!This was the man who made ""Bad Taste""...what is going on?"
1,ONLY 3 out of 12 disc will play,"The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition) Elijah Wood, et al Sold by: VE N: B000654ZK0,Walls Video 4 Less (seller profile)ONLY 3 out of 12 disc will play!!!. They were Sold as NEW, but some disc were BADLY scratched & most disc have Gagged & rough places along the rim that cause our DVD players to reject the disc.The Return of the King disc had white specks that resemble mold. I got the feeling that these DVD's were salvaged factory rejects.I was reading the Lord of the Rings to my son & bought the Extended DVDs to watch when we had finished.We finished the books & was shocked & Disappointed when we tried to watch the DVD's.Sadly, by the then was TOO LATE to return them. So I am also out the money.I am also SHOCKED that anybody would sell these to the public, as NEW OR any other way."
1,It deserves no stars,"Tolkien was not keen on seeing his works on film. Indeed most of his friends were vehemently against it, especially C.S. Lewis. Out of respect for the author, any true admirer of Tolkien should not support any movie made from any of his works.Tolkien himself said:""In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature...visible presentation...silliness or morbidity are frequent results"" (""Essays"" 68)In this case silliness is definitely the result. This film has terrible special effects that look as fake as they are, the acting leaves a great deal to be desired and the characters are miscast and cartoonized.In the extended edition many hoped it would be 'fixed' but even duct tape couldn't fix this disaster, if you buy this it would be a better investment to flush your money down the nearest drain. Go buy the book."
4,coleccion completa!,"4 estrellas porque es la version extendida que menos le aporta a la historia, LAS DOS TORRES, fue un ejemplo de lo que una version extendida podia aportar a los fans de los libros que quedaron esperando por mas en las versiones cinematograficas, en este capitulo, abundan las escenas cortas que no aportan mas que ""duracion"" al filme. Sin embargo... puedo citar que al igual que las anteriores, esta muy bien hecha y posee ciertas reminicencias de la obra de nuestro querido profesor Tolkien."
5,Best movie ever! A must see!,"This is by far the best movie in the LOTR series, and I love the first two. The Return of the King is truly amazing and wil have you watching it over and over again. New characters are introduced and so many amazing events happen. Five stars are not enough!"
5,Lord of the Rings,"Thanks for the movie, its my favorite of the trilogy and it was the only one I didn't have on extended edition."
5,The crowning touch to an amazing trilogy!!,"The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it's the last one. Oh yeah, and it isn't the extended version DVD. I had to buy this movie even though I knew a better version was coming out before Christmas; it's just too good to wait that long. Although I loved the movie, I did have one complaint: the whole Saruman plotline is wrapped up in a really odd way. (Peter Jackson promises that this will be rectified in the extended version.) The extras on this DVD aren't anything special, but I don't buy DVDs for the extras. If you loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies, you'll definitely love this one too!!"
5,"Great, as expected","I got this DVD case less than a week after ordering it. It was in its original wrapping, and when I opened it the DVDs were flawless, and the case included the advertisement that all DVDs come with! Inside the case there is a booklet which basically explains how awesome this movie is, and gives a layout of how bonus feature content. Overall, a great purchase that my boyfriend will love."
4,"Good movie, bad streaming","It's Lord of the Rings, what else can I say? It's a good fantasy adventure any male over the age of 7 will enjoy. Yes, yes, a lot of women will enjoy it too. What bugged me was the HD streaming. Although we have an HD Vizio TV with streaming capability built in with the fastest Internet speed available for residential use, we had to put up with ""buffering"" about 15 times before the system just gave up and transmitted standard definition. We don't often order the HD streaming just because we're cheap, but now I won't order because I prefer a movie without constant interruption. Good movie, glitchy technology."
5,The King Has A Thunderous Return,"This movie is such a well-directed and polished movie. I never saw any mistakes in the theatrical release.Great movie altogether. Awesome special effects and the camera views are amazing. Jackson captures every inch of the battles and landscapes.Minas Tirith is beautiful. I loved how he did the courtyard, where it looked like a place of elegance compared to the rest of Minas Tirith.The acting was superb also. I really have to comment on Elijah's and Sam's acting. They're acting made it seem like it really happened to them.If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now!! It's a great movie and very, very Oscar worthy."
1,A travesty which dishonors JRR Tolkien,"This movie is a prime example of why not every book should be made into a movie, least of all an amazing classic like The Lord of the Rings. Not only was much of the original material overlooked, but new material was added that did nothing to enhance the story. Did Peter Jackson think that no one would come see the movie if there was no romance? Romance was added and at the most inappropriate moments. Characters died that never did, true heroism was turned into cloying, wistful looks and less than heroic speech. Worst of all was the return of Sam and Frodo to the untouched Shire. Tolkien was making a huge point by having them return to a Shire that was being ravaged and ripped apart. It would seem that no one connected with these movies bothered to read or understand Tolkien's work.Save your money and buy a good copy of these books and read them many times in the years ahead."
3,Bloated and Silly-Save Your Money,"I am a longtime fan of the books and received all three theatrical releases with great emotion. As the coda of the Trilogy, I had high hopes for the extended version. Alas, alas. The extra time that could have been used to relate threads of the complex story and tie up loose ends has been wasted. The added scenes are, for the most part, all non-canonical. (I.e., not in the book). The most important loose end, the Three Rings, is left almost as afterthought and even then it wasn't gotten right. It was an essential plot point and it was cheerfully tossed overboard in favor of creating non-events. Unless you crave the endless extra features and frat-boy prank Easter eggs, save your money and buy the plain-jane DVD version of this movie. You will miss nothing but disgust."
5,Great Movie,Well. Here is the last LOTR Extended film. I can't wait for this Gift Set to come out. My Mom is getting it for me for christmas. Who would not love Peter Jackson's LOTR Extended movies? They're great. See this when it comes out!Rated: PG-13 For Epic Battle Sequences and Scary Stuff.Running Time: 250 minutes
5,OSCARS ARE CRAP!!,"Everyone is rite!!! The LOTR movies have to be best film ever produced and no one in the bloody Oscar commitee have realised it. Last year it was some stupid movie who won the oscar(I cant remeber the movies name) this year CHICAGO. Where do all these movies stand against LOTR?? no where!!!Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings deserve an Oscar more than any other nominated film. I mean a guy who dedicated years of his life to the making this movie isn't a good director??? Yeah rite!! GO LOTR !!! Oscar u deserve ,but if u r not given one, its okay because we, the world recognises your greatness and incredible and breathtaking plot which can only be compared to the famous MahaBaratha epic and Dune Chronicles!!"
2,How many of you think that...,"Frodo actually is supposed to tackle Gollum into the volcano after his finger's bitten off?I watched the first two films and thought, hmmm, it's not true to the book but it's not TERRIBLE but Peter Jackson completely lost any hope of my being a fan of his work when he butchered the most essential part of the story-line, where the ring itself is destroyed. I'm very afraid of what's gonna happen now that Hollywoods getting their hands on Aslan as well. Yikes!"
5,ROTK,"Wow this moie was great finally we get to see thee end of all evil in Middle Earth.Thanks to the memebers of the fellowship of the ring,Frodo, Sam, Pippen, Merry, Gimli, Legolas, Arogorn, Bomir.I loved seeing Gollem/Smeagal Fall in the Fires of Mount doom that was a good part when him and the ring were destoryed!!!!!:)YA WHO WO!I wacthed it over and over 4 times!! And still going to wacth it more.It is the best movie Ever!!!! I recomend it:)"
5,Best movie ever,"The movie was incredible. The best out of ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and if you haven't watched it please watch it. It is the best movie of all time."
5,MY PRECIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE RETURN OF THE KING WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD OWN IT AND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE LORD OF THE RINGS YOU BETTER START LIKING IT!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE SEEN MOVIES SUCH AS VAN HELSING, HARRY POTTER, MONTY PYTHON (RUN AWAY!!!), SPIDERMAN, AND THE MUMMY AND THE MUMMY RETURNS AND NONE OF THESE COULD EVER BEAT ANY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES. I OWN ALL THREE OF THE DVDS, BOOKS, POSTERS, A BLANKET, SOUNDTRACKS FOR ALL THREE, BOOKMARKS, AND EVEN POSTAGE STAMPS. IN MY OPINION, THE RETURN OF THE KING WAS THE BEST OUT OF THE THREE MOVIES AND THE BEST BOOK OUT OF THE THREE BOOKS. J.R.R.TOLKIEN REALLY IS THE BEST AUTHOR AND PETER JACKSON IS REALLY THE BEST DIRECTOR!! THERE IS A GREAT CAST IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES.BUY THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THE RETURN OF THE KING EXTENDED VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Latest Blu-ray release is a Theatrical re-release (201 Min) Not Special Extended (Not 250 Min),"The skinny is this should be subtitled as ""Theatrical Edition"" (201 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (250 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!"
5,Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,I bought the trilogy on Blu-Ray for about $7.50 on ave each. It was a no brainer buy. A must have. Something to the level or even better than the original Star War Trilogy.
2,Greatest Trilogy?,"Hit or miss at best! Extended close-ups on hobbits' maudlin faces. Way too many chaotic battle scenes introduced by ""inspirational"" speeches that leave you in diabetic shock. 16 hours of filthy people in variations of the same set. This was a project for a genenarion hungry for a series to call its own. Why not worship the Naked Gun Trilogy instead? Forced themes and pretentious dialogue does nothing to distract me from the fact that Jackson used to make unique and vibrant movies like Heavenly Creatures and Dead Alive. I see the same problems with this ""epic"" that all the naysayers are critisizing the Star Wars series for. The difference is Lucas created his universe, his landscapes, his overblown story arcs and failed on his OWN vision. Killing your past idols doesn't a masterpiece make...."
5,Excellent Movie,"*************Five Stars, Plus!!!!!! A wonderful movie. A movie you can watch again and again and still feel like it's the first time you've seen it. I rarely watch a movie twice, but the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy has got me. I've seen all three and have seen No. 1 and No. 2 way more than once and will continue to watch them over and over again. You can't help but be mesmerized. Can't wait for Return of the King DVD to come out."
5,What I think about this movie...,"This movie is the best I have seen in a long time. It follows the books along perfectly. It couldn't have been made better. I think that this would be the kind of movie that would make people want to see it every day of there life. Even if you haven't read the books, this movie explains everything. It is full of action, excitement, suspence, and even some humor. I mean, what else could you want in a series of movies??"
5,great movie of all time,"Been watching the movie several times I can't get tired of it. I love the whole story,the characters and everything making this movie great."
3,Don't jump the gun before the extended edition.,"I think the distributors deliberately release this shorter, inferior 2-dvd set long before the 4-dvd extended set is released like they did with the last two in the series. I was tricked into buying the 2-dvd first release of ""Fellowship"" and then only regretted it when the 4-dvd release came out a few weeks later - i sold it on ebay and coughed up the extra dough for the 4-dvd set. if you're a real fan, you'll want to wait for the 4-dvd set to come out, which will likely include extra footage and other special features.BUT... this movie series rocks, and this version will cost less than the extended set will, so i have to give it a neutral rating based on that."
1,Great BIG Movie -- lots of shortcomings.,"I have to say that I enjoyed watching these movies, but I have read the books and knew what was going on. Several people I know who had not read the books could not follow the screenplay at all. Upon further reflection, I realized that although the action scenes were Epic and overwhelming in their intensity, they did nothing to allow you to glimpse into these characters as they were created in Tolkein's books nor did the dialogue allow you to follow the plot as it advanced. There was not a failure in the epic quality -- there was a failure of genuineness -- if it had hit the mark -- even those who had not read the books would have understood and been able to follow the movies."
1,Ring Wraith Gets His Due,"I'm tired of hearing these whiny complainers griping about the Witch King breaking poor Gandalf's Staff, ""Sniff, sniff"". Maybe Peter Jackson was trying to make up for the weakly portrayed nazgul throughout the previous films. Aragorn, single handed, defeating the Ringwraiths on Weathertop, including the Witch King??? Give me a break. Now that, was a travesty, but I didn't hear any whining then."
5,Best movie ever!,"The Lord of the Rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting, fantastical scenery, and thrilling plot twists. Peter Jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single Oscar they got. The movies are a wonderful tribute to the books. Fortunately, they've been made so well that they can be enjoyed by all, from the Tolkien aficionado to kids who haven't yet read the books. If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the greatest adventure in cinematography during the past decade.Return of the King expands upon the trilogy even further into a visual feast. From the dead ghosts to the Mumakil elephants, it rightly ranks as one of the most impressive films ever. My only advice would be to get the extended edition rather than this theatrical version - the former contains over an hour of new scenes. It will be a visual feast on blu-ray."
2,Information? yes. Professional? no.,"Definitely not worth the $30. Shot at her home with counter top appliances and spice containers that jump around from shot to shot. In one spot her words are deleted and replaced with other wording while her lips move. Her choices of scent and color don't compliment. She doesn't mention a lot of things that I already know, being essential oils vs. fragrance oils, etc. If you want some basic information without any of the professionalism, this would work, but not for the $30. And she also shows melt and pour soap which is already soap, so that's not really making soap."
3,Wire popped,"This is a lovely bra. It supports, shapes, separates, and feels comfy enough. But the wire popped almost immediately! No, I didn't put it in the washer; this was before I ever washed it. The wire poked out and proceeded to stab me in side. I tried taking it off and pushing the wire back in. I put it on and the wire popped right out again. Very uncomfortable, and disappointing!"
5,Great Support!,If you are larger busted-- this is a fabulous bra for you. I am a DDD and it is incredibly supportive and it is pretty. I love the new color Latte and black is always good.The lace on the top is stretchy and makes it custom fit to your bustline. It definitely gives you great lift and support.
5,Worship with Don Moen,Don Moen music and ministry helps folks get through the tough times of life and be at peace.Thank you very much.
2,Items Really Small,These are really small. They almost remind you of doll size. I'm am returning them and going to go purchase them in a store so that I can actually see the item before purchase so this doesn't happen again.
5,Great toy cooking set,"My 3 year old loves to play cook. This set is perfect and replicates ""Mommy's big set.""Perfect as a gift too."
5,perfect sizes,"I got this for my daughters new kidcraft kitchen set, these pots and tools look and feel real and she loves playing with them."
2,Cookware set - Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware, the photograph on the advertisement fot this product is not the actual product that you will get. This is not a stainless steel cookware set like the photo shows. I purchased this set for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas, and wrapped it up right away when I received it. I was extremely surprised when my daughter opened it and it wasn't the same product that was advertised. What we got was a combination of the bunch of things. The cookware was multiple pieces that were painted steel some with wooden handles some with metal, a real porcelain tea set that is highly breakable and absolutely tiny (several of ours are borken already) and various steel (stainless?) utensils. Since my daughter opened it and didn't know the difference I never bothered to return it or follow-up on it. I guess we are dissapointed although my daughter still likes it."
3,"Fine, but small in scale","My toddler loves all of the spoons, spatulas and strainers included with this set. It's good quality, but a bit small in scale to add play food and ""cook""."
3,Too Small,The pots and pans were MUCH smaller than I expected. They would not fit any of my kids pretend food. I had just got them the Kidkraft kitchen and this set was way too small for this kitchen. It would be good for a table top stove or something.
3,this is pretty small,The pots and pans are sturdy but are quite small. Also the utensils seem rather sharp.
2,"A disappointing descent into common ""New Age""","Maybe he was worried about being confused with his brother. Or maybe the record company was putting the screws to him. But after the soulful explorations of ""Voices"" and his subsequent efforts, Roger Eno took a turn toward New Age sewage. I see now there were hints of it on ""The Familiar,"" but I never thought R. Eno would resort to the New Age gloss that chokes ""Lost in Translation."""
3,Worked fine--then didn't heat up very well,When I first got this product it heated up very well and stayed hot. The different tips were very useful. After maybe 4 hours of use (over different days) it didn't get as hot and I had a hard time finishing my project with a consistent heat created a uniform look.
1,Cheap Attachments,I used the knife for about 10 hours of use and like others have stated I had the threaded part of the knife break off inside the tool.. i was able to get the threaded part out of the tool with some work but looking at the other tips for it i see i will most likely have the same problem again. also i have not been able to find a replacement knife tip for it so i am moving on to another maker and see if i have better results.. worked great until it broke.
2,Lumbering and unappealing out of context,"These are stereo recordings from 1961 that were part of an unfinished B minor Mass. It's not much fun to hear such lumbering singing without the respite of solos in between. I am a great admirer of Klemperer's stereo B minor Mass, but this was a dreary experience that ended about halfway through."
2,Loading problems,"Not putting them on the sander...just that the paper loads up so quickly that you are going through tubes way too fast. If you use any type of filler to fill nail holes on molding then try to sand with this device, you are lucky if you can get through two or three holes before the paper is completely clogged and yhou have to take it off, rotate it and put it back on. Too much hassle. Used once, sitting in the back of the shop collecting dust. Much more efficient to do it by hand. Save your money."
3,Enjoyable,"Somewhat informative about the liveaboard/cruiser lifestyle. It is worth viewing. I will enjoy wathcing it again. Not a life changer, but gives some nice video of travels from LA to the Bahamas. Some interesting video of the Panama Canal and sailing underway."
2,Pros and Cons,"Before i start i want to say that if you want a game that you can play for a year and not beat this is the game.Madden 2002 has many good and bad things about it, Great A.I. and it is also very realistic, maybe too realistic.I say too realistic because you can get fidgity when the Refs pull out the chain or the teams switch sides. It shows all of this so it can really be time consuming.Also, a good QB can complete at least 65% of their passes. EA dosen't agree with me though 'cause in Madden 2002 even if your guy is open there is still a good chance that the ball will go through their head or their hands.Quick, name a RB who can rush 12 yards a carry. What, no one does, well go tell that to EA cause on the hardest diffulculty I can rush for 12 yards a carry with Browns running back Rhite.Bottom Line: Rent it, or pick it up at a yard sale cheap."
2,Where is that turbo control...,"In short, if you like repeatedly tapping a button over and over again, then this game is for you! If you are really interested, this is a rental at best, only has about 12 hours of playing time. If there is an upside, some of the animation sequences are quite nice."
3,Not so good but you get what you pay for,I don't particularly like this carrier. It is hard to ge the baby in and out of and isn't very comfortable on your back.The way to put baby in is from the top. Then you have to wiggle and jiggle the baby into the holes for the feet. And to get the baby out is even more of a challenge. My babies feet would always get stuck in the holes and you would need 4 hands to get the baby free.Not worth all the trouble....get a Bjorn! Much better.
2,Rocket Science,I never figured out how to get my baby in and out of this carrier and I felt uncomfortable when he was in it. The design is overly complex but I am sure there is some good use for thing...perhaps a modernistic hanging fern planter:)
4,Cozy Rider for dads . . . .,I purchased my Cozy Rider with the expectation of being able to carry my newborn son while still having my hands free to do other things. The Cozy Rider is pretty comfortable to wear and realatively easy to get into and adjust. Putting the baby in by yourself though can be interesting! Little legs and arms don't seem to always go where you want them to. Although they say it can be used for newborns I wouldn't recommend using it until your baby can hold his/her head up on their own. My son was 6lbs 13 oz when born and I waited until he was almost 9 lbs before using it and without head control his head was fairly floppy in it. Since my baby is getting bigger this is a great product for us. It gives me a chance to do things with both hands and still be bonding and close with my baby. I hope this helps you make your decision!
3,You get what you pay for,We purchased this item over a year ago when i was pregnant with my daughter. We only used this product about 3 times and that was only in the house. The head support just didnt seem that sturdy to me. And not only that it was very hard to get her in and out of this thing. The struggle with that alone was just not worth it. Also this didnt seem to work too well in forward facing mode for bigger babies. It was just too awkward and there isnt that much support. Definitely for smaller ones only.I gave it 3 stars cause overall its not that bad a product. The few times we did use it my daugther seemed to enjoy it. I have not totally given up in this product as i am expecting a boy in february and i will give this a try once again and see how it works out.
2,do not buy these...,"well, what i said above pretty much sums it up. Do not buy these. I got these before the summer of 2006, im going to say around may. They stopped working by november. I didn't even wear them around... I used them with my computer, and my DVD player when my roomate was sleeping. POS, and a waste of money. they look nice, but that is all. do not use you money on these. Skullcandy should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a piece of garbage."
3,Where is the high end?,"These headphones have solid construction and are reasonably comfortable. The sound quality is the most important thing to me, and that's where these headphones are lacking. The high end sounds very muffled. Overall the sound is very muddy. The lower-mid and low frequencies are boosted too much, and the high frequencies are dramatically cut which results in a very strange and unnatural sound. The volume control and the fact that you can disconnect the extension cord is nice. If you just want loud bass and don't care about the overall sound then these might work for you. They look very cool, but if you care about sound quality and accuracy I would get some AKG's or Sennheiser headphones instead."
5,GREAT CONVERSATION PIECE....from author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS...,"Naturally, the title drew me in. I voted for Hillary! I'd love to give a woman a shot and place all new cards on the table. Books that introduce you to possibilities and are fodder to make you, ""Hmmm! Why not?"" intrigue me. After all, how many conversations have actually started with the very title of this book? I enjoyed every essay, every thought and possibility behind them. This is a wonderful gift to a woman of any age, profession, or background and is a perfect conversation piece! Keep it on your coffe table!"
4,"Interesting book, very complete collection of work","I bought this book for a college math course. This book would be equally good for math or art students. It is full of historical, chronological information and also covers how the artist's methods are in use today and are being further explored and appreciated. This is also a 100% complete collection of the artist's (very extensive) work."
5,Good item,This item has helped with my uric acid problem and is highly recommended . I have used it for sometime and it works.
4,Better when play with friends,"This game is fun, but single player is fairly easy. The place where this game excels is in multi player. It is so much fun to play against your friends in 4 player mode. Do not buy this game if you are looking for a realistic classic football game. Buy Madden. This game is just for fun, kind of like old school NBA Jam."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This game blows!!....If you want a game with realistic game play, funny commentary and incredible graphics get Sega NFL 2K2."
3,Decent Hockey Game,"I'm not upset I bought it. A good hockey game for hockey fans. It doesn't hold your interest enough to play it everyday, but it is still okay. My criticisms are that the difference between Easy and Medium are drastic, I can score 8 times in easy mode, but in Medium, I'm lucky if I score twice in a game. Also, I think the season/franchise mode should be more like Madden's franchise mode, the free agent system of smilie faces (indicating if they like your team) is a little bush-league. Also, the interface for changing lines and such can be frustrating to learn.The graphics are better than a lot of games for sure. Overall a decent game, I reccomend it to hockey fans."
4,"Awesome Game, but STILL no franchising available! :(","Excellent game play and player control makes NHL 2002 an excellent game to own. The break away cam, great hit cam and excellent game cam make NHL 2002 a visually entertaining game with many hours of fun.Unfortunately, NHL 2002 does not have franchising available, saving a season takes half of a memory card, and I have not found out (if possible) how to save only a profile, and not a season.All in all, this is an excellent game with excellent features added to improve over the previous version."
3,I thought 2002 would be better than 2001...I was wrong,"This isn't a bad game at all, but it isn't much of an improvement over 2001. It might not be an improvement at all. The commentary is better, but the game-play and graphics are pretty much the same. Also, a career mode is present, but it doesn't provide the depth necessary to make it a fun feature. The user interface used to view stats and edit lines is a bit cumbersome. For example: there is no quick way to switch a guy on SL1 with a guy on SL2. You have to go through and change each player separately. Not a big deal, but when you make a trade or someone gets hurt and they are on several lines, going through each one and changing it does take some time. The UI is one thing they should have left the same.I was hoping for a big jump forward from last year, but 2002 isn't. It is still a good game, but if you have 2001 you don't need this one."
3,Honest Review from a NHL 2001 Addict,"I miss NHL 2001. I've played about 3-4 games of 2002 and I just can't digest it. They left out my favorite camera views, familiar crowd noice (screaming girl), and so many other little things. I'm not being picky at all, its just there was so many little elements of 2001 that I don't see in 2002, its hard to get used to, and hard to accept.The animation of the coaches is still bad. They still have oversized chopsticks for hands. The crowd still looks lousy.I love EA Sports.I love what they do.But something is wrong here.Overall gameplay is a little better. One good thing.The UI does nto compare to 2001. Why change a good look?Buy it, but keep your 2001 around. Overall 2001 is a much more exciting game. I hate to say that, but its an honest assessment from someone who worships NHL 2001 and who counted the days until 2002 came out last week."
4,Enjoyable,"Four stars, because they weren't as good as the first, but my 3yr old loves them all just the same."
3,of course not as good as the orignal,"The price is good for two movies, and definitely in quality condition from the retailer. My daughter gets bored or doesn't like it after a bit, she loves the original."
2,A few pros....LOTS OF CONS!,"This little MP3 player produces excellent sound and has one of the best ambient mic recorders I've ever heard, but beyond that it isn't very functional. I have yet to figure out how to make a separate playlist within the device inspite of reading the manual twice through! You can't alter the track order after the music has been placed on the device, and there a significant delay when you skip through tracks. The battery life is mediocre and that is only if you alter the power settings. WARNING: the battery in this device will drain even when its off! I left it in a drawer for two days with a brand new battery and it was dead when I tried to turn it on again."
4,The path revealed,"Robert Borski does a phenomenal job of explaining the intricate orbits of the various characters revolving around the Book of the New Sun. His theories are well-founded and shine light on the mysteries hidden deep within the labyrinth forged by the master Gene Wolfe. If you thought you could follow the twisting and turning path of Severian and those accompanying him, think again. This book is for you."
5,Ceiling Fan Duster that doesn't cause a dust storm,"Used with the FUller Brush Duister Spray this product is excellent for not creating a dust storm to activate allergies. I also reviewed the duster spray and found it to be excellent, held the dust in the duster and not in the air. The spray does not have an over powering odor that can kick off asthma attacks either."
5,Great Game to play with your friends!,"My friends and I love this game! It has become a classic in our group. The gameplay is simple enough to master in an hour, but fun enough to keep us coming back to it. It's such a great, simple game. It's more of an arcade sports game, and is the only violent hockey game that I know of. It's 10 years old, so obviously the graphics aren't great, but the game feels right with older graphics. It wouldn't have the same feel with more realistic graphics. Anyways, the gameplay is so fun, my friends and I beat the whole game. You can play the season and win the Stanely Cup with either a present team or your own create-a-team. Create-a-team is great. The unlockables are also fun to get: new stadiums, player heads, etc. I would highly recommend this game. So worth $5."
2,Not worth the money,I bought this game and the graphics are good but the gameplay is horrible. Instead of a typical 5 on 5 it is 3 on 3 for games and exhibition. Not realistic at all in the passing and one-timer moves. Not worth the money.
4,Uncovered Wagon,"A solid piece of crafsmanship. Built with the utmost concern for manueverability. this Radio Flyer with the elongated rotating plastic handle glides along like a 10 speed on a bike path. Oversized tires cushion the blow and the stowaway compartments under the seats, while smallish, still allow for the second passenger to sit relatively comfortably.Lug nuts on tires were a bit confusing to assemble and fasten, but overall the bell of the ball as far as plastic family wagons are concerned."
3,step2 is better,"i bought this because it was award winning. also because i thought (as it seemed) it had space underneath the seats. instead, the spaces are for the children's feet to place when they ride around. although this wagon can weigh over 200 pounds (my husband and i lax in it a couple of times), i do not recommend it. my nephews have step2 wagon and it's a lot more durable for a smaller price and it's still going strong after two and half years. with this wagon, i tend to pay close attention to the wheels because they seem untrustworthy. maybe if you live on a flat area this wagon would be okay, but i live on a rocky place and i need something more durable as far as safety is concern. (i've only had this wagon for a month now... let's see if it'll last for more than a year.)"
1,My Suburban has a tighter turning radius than this wagon.,"I've nearly dumped the kids out of this thing no less than 15 times. I've rented the most beat to hell, nasty wagons from Zoos, Amusement parks and ones I've pulled off the curb and they all blow this one out of the water. I have my original Radio Flyer with the wooden removable sides that's over 20 years old - It's rusted, rotted and one wrong look at it from falling apart, but I would use that before I take this thing out.Bottom line is if you want to turn, you need an exit ramp length distance and have to start about 1/4mi from it, otherwise the wheels bind up and you'll dump the kids out. The wheels on this thing sink into everything."
5,Great wagon,"We received it as a birthday present for our 1 year old. He and his older brother (2 1/2) love riding in it. I looked a lot into wagons before picking this one. It's great b/c of the rubber tires (I hear plastic tires are really loud and impractical), pivoting front wheels, seatbelts, raised walls, and seems durable so far! The one thing is that the 1 year old likes to put his hand down and touch the wheel, and I have to keep reminding him not to do that. The older one knows not to do it. He can't reach over enough to get his fingers caught or anything. It's the only thing that I wish didn't happen with it, but otherwise we are loving it and use it every day."
1,pull handle problem,I am actually very handy and good at assembling products. This wagon went together easily until I got to the last step: attaching the pull handle. It simply doesn't fit and the holes you put the axle into are impossible to get lined up.Part# 2700.0830599 and 2700.0830203.I thought the handle was just defective (came out of the mold too early) and called for a new one.The factory sent one in about a week. It was exactly the same so I returned the whole wagon to Amazon.
2,Connecting handle to wagon is POOR,"Trying to feed the bar through the holes in order to connect the handle to the wagon body is difficult. And then trying to hammer on the nuts to keep the bar in place is exasperating. Why they didn't design this with a threaded rod, who knows. Glad I don't have to ride in it."
5,Seat Belts- YEA!!!,"This wagon is obviously becoming very popular becuase it is often sold out here at amazon. Word of advice- toys r us does not carry this model in their stores only online. But, you can usually find this wagon at your local stores. Anyway, I've only had it a few days but so far I just think it's great. I have 2 year old twins and a three year old. They all fit in this wagon when the seats are folded down. I think the seatbelt feature is wonderful. My twins are not good stroller riders so I'm hoping this wagon will be a little more fun to ride in!!"
4,Radio Flyer Pathfinder - Nice Product,"Bought this product for my year old grand-daughter. Very nice and well built wagon. Has the flip up seats & seatbelts which are a much for young children and even a ""sippie cup"" holder.NOTE: When assembling, make sure you put some grease on the front wheel shafts that go up through wagon base and attach with a clutch cap. The instructions do not mention this. When I firstput it together and pulled the wagon, the front wheels would not ""track"" properly and really just had a mind of their own. I pulled the front wheel assemblies and coated with some vasoline and that did the trick.Would buy again."
3,Wheels are different than pictured?,"I received one wagon from Amazon that I returned because the wheels were not the same pictured on the products picture from Amazon. I received a second wagon today, and still with different wheels than the picture. I'm not sure which wheels I should be getting, or what all the new recent orders wheels look like, but I'm wondering if mine is a way older, or newer model. I'm a bit disappointed because the wheels we got feel much more plastic than the radio flyer we looked at Wal-Mart."
3,Good solid wagon but with some flaws,"I bought the wagon for my grandchildren, knowing Radio Flyer from when I was a kid. Although Amazon offered a very good price, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of updated gadgets on it compared to another wagon I was going to order. The picture was very deceiving - there isn't extra storage space - as it seems, only when the seats are folded down and the worse part is the handle doesn't stay up - so it takes up a lot of extra room. The wheels are great - and the kids love it - just a few slight things that I wouldn't order this particular one again."
4,My daughter loved it!,The only complaint I have is the turning mechanism.It does not pivot which can be aggrevating when driving her.
3,reveiw,"We have concerns about the seat backs … my grandson got his foot caught between the two seat backs as they were folded down inside and began crying thinking he couldn’t get out.. if we had not been right there he might have fallen out trying to get his foot loose, but other than that he does like the wagon.."
3,If I had it to do over...,We bought the wagon for our grandson's first b-day. He loved it and didn't want to play with anything else. The front tires are not like any other's and they move independantly of each other. They make it hard to pull and handle if there isn't any weight in the wagon. One of the seat belts pulled out of the plastic housing right away...made it useless. Good points - - seats lock in upright position as does the handle. There is a small built-in hole on the bottom so the wagon cannot fill up with water. This is important because the wagon is fairly deep to accommodate legs and feet.
5,Great wagon but hard to manuever,"I recently received this wagon as a gift for my 1 year old son. I love the wagon's size - it's huge - and the fact that it has seat belts for the two seats and a large compartment for storage.The only thing I HATE about it is the handle/steering. The handle is stationary (it's not attached to an axle), making it difficult to manuever (especially backing up). I know it was made this way to prevent tipping, but it's so aggravating trying to pull the wagon left or right (or backwards or around tight corners) because the front wheels seem to have a mind of their own!! I literally have to use two hands to pull and tug on the wagon to get it where I want it to go. That's the only gripe I have about this wagon."
2,Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon Red is a bust,"I was really disappointed in this product. I thought the radio flyer was suppose to be one of the best, but it is cheap and does not go together easily. The seat back does pop into place so it doesn collapse on the child, but it does not pop into place when closed. So the seat backs just flop around when you put them down. A real disappointment."
5,Christmas gift,"What a wonderful wagon for any age child; but, especially for the little ones who need to be buckled in. Lots of room."
5,Great wagon,"Wagon is bigger than expected, but great quality, and cool features, like the cup/juice box holders, drain holes in bottom, and seat belts."
3,Toy is much too difficult to put together,"I just bought the pathfinder for my son, based on the good reviews I've read of this item. I have one MAJOR CRITICISM. I made some mistakes putting the wagon together, and I've had one heck of a time trying to undo my mistakes!! The way the wagon is put together is with caps you hammer on. Make one mistake with putting the wagon together and you're going to ruin the wagon trying to undo your mistakes. I'm writing the company to complain. One would think in this day and age of self-assembly, they could have used nuts and bolts to hold the wagon together!"
1,Noisy and unreliable,"I bought this item for use with a large, metal lamp. The touch dimmer barely works (it only recognizes about 10% of the touches on the lamp) and in both of partially-dim settings, the dimmer (not the bulb) buzzes very loudly. I will be ordering a different model immediately."
1,Did Not Work,I used the Plug-In Dimmer on a metal floor lamp set on a wood floor. It took several touches before anything would happen. The worst was that the light bulb flickered on when turned off. This was a useless waste of money and I feel stupid for purchasing it.
5,A.J. Jr,I just love Harry Potter.Im up to the third book and its really exciting.If you haven't played it yet you really should. Catch ya!
2,FLYING LESSONS??????,"I got this game a while ago and have played it a couple of times, but I always get stuck on the flying lessons. It might be because I'm not an avid playstation player, but I can not get past it. I would only suggest this game for people who are really good at using the controller. I can't really give this game a good rating because I don't really know what it does."
1,Want to Waste Your Time?,"I think whomever wrote this game is a sadist. You can't get past the flying lesson, and once in, you have to go through different levels of difficulty. Want to save your game? Too bad! You can't get away from the flying lesson to save your progress. I can't think that the author of Harry Potter would want poor Harry flying endless attempts to get out of Madame Hooch's lesson. I tried to find other areas in the castle to explore, but all roads lead to the flying lesson. Bah Humbug!"
1,Don't waste your time or your money,Fortunately I rented this game before I made the mistake of purchasing it. It took a total of 6 hours to complete the entire game (this includes finding the secret rooms and items). One would expect alot longer playing time from a new game.It was very dissapointing to my children. There is very little challange in the game and no replay value what so ever for experienced game players. Even my four year old quickly figured it out. I would not reccomend this game to even the hardcore Harry Potter fan.
4,Great game!,"My grandson and I play it. The only thing you do need a memory card to save where you are, are you have to start over from the beginning.. It's not real hard. My grandson enjoys it so do I."
4,Super Fun Action,"This game is a blast! Relatively easy to get into and fast-paced action. The missions are short, you won't be playing this game for entire days, but perfect for a couple of hours of high-intensity. Not only do you get to navigate mazes around the world, but you also get to blow stuff up. Now what could be better? The 2 player levels, well, some are a bit dry, but I never thought I would be competing to run over the most chickens in any game! Gobble-gobble."
5,I want my life back!,I always thought people who played video games were loosers. Then I bought a Playstation2/Spy Hunter for my kids. Now I can't switch the game off. My kids hate me and my marriage is in ruins. BRILLIANT! Spy Hunter is for all right thinking adults out there. Kids...go and play on your bikes!
3,Flawed But Still Fun,"Spy Hunter is a fun action pacted game that is great when you first start playing it, but becomes quickly sappy and annoying. Having to go back through certain mission to complete certain objectives to get points really gets on your nerves. Also, the game really isn't that hard, except for a few missions and those are killers. I found myself doing one particular mission like 25 times. I did it so often that I had the entire landscape mapped out! But the game is pretty cool mostly because of the wide range of weapons you can use, such as targeted swarmer missles and a rail gun. The defensive weapons are pretty cool too. Overall though, Spy Hunter's a game to simply rent a play until you have to return it; don't waste your money on it."
3,If yo uOwn GT3 you will be disappointed in this game,This game is ok but if you own GT3 you will be very disappointed in this game. The graphics are not even close to the excellent graphics of GT3. Its an ok game though and if you like racing games you'll like this one.
2,Disturbing,"I realize Anne Lamont is an excellent author but this book I found to be extremely disturbing,actually to the point of several times putting the book down and trying to get it off my mind,but she is successful in making one reading it to the end.I did not have any sympathy for Elizabeth in this book,was enthralled with Rosie,and felt heartache for a child to have to endure the pangs of an alcoholic mother. I am sorry I read this book."
2,"Excellent Writing, Dull Story","I purchased the book because of the promise on the back cover, ""As Rosie grows older and more curious, Elizabeth must find a way to nurture her extraordinary daughter - even if it means growing up herself.""I kept waiting to get to the part where Elizabeth grows up, but that isn't what the book is about at all. The book is about an alcoholic who never grows up, although she does stop drinking at the very end."
3,Worth reading,"Lamott's book ""Bird by Bird"" on writing was really superb and unforgettable. So, I wanted to absolutely love ""Rosie."" The characters are indelibly etched in my mind, especially Rae, James, and Rosie. And, parts of the book, mostly the parts about Rosie's character make the the entire book worthwhile. But, I had to force myself to pick it back up after putting it down a few times, and that's not a good sign. It lacked plot. There was nothing that I was really dying to find out. And, the main character's self-obsessed complaining got a little old; she had everything, and just couldn't seem to get it together. I kept hoping she'd just grow up and get over herself. I think the book is worth reading, but don't expect brilliance. Expect a good book that is slow in parts, but that in the end, you'll probably be glad you read."
5,Not the type of book I usually read,"""Rosie"" is not the type of book I usually read. In fact, I discovered Anne Lamott quite by accident. I first read ""Blue Shoe"" and found the insights into a normal person's sometimes insane psyche incredibly compelling. Lamott has an uncanny ability to capture a woman/mother's daily struggle to hold her life together while maintaining her sanity. Aspects of her characters ring true with moments from almost anyone's life. ""Rosie"" beautifully captures the competing demands between self-fulfillment, motherhood, and addiction. I highly recommend this book. I am hooked!"
4,"Excellent classical-era concerto for guitar and orch, duos","As far as concertos for guitar with orchestra, the one on this recording is much better than the overhyped, overrated, bloated Concierto de Aranjuez and is on par with those of Giuliani. There's plenty of attention to detail in the duos as well. The Erik Stenstadvold/Martin Haug de l'Hoyer duos sound rather dull compared to this cd. Much higher marks for this recording."
4,Turn the Paige,"Another enjoyable Paige Turner mystery that gallops along at a breakneck pace. I found mayself having to take some deep breaths to keep up with Paige and Abby in their search for a murderer in the world of 50's television. The 50's setting is done wonderfully well, and the author keeps the books entertaining and fresh by not overdoing it. The usual suspects are both facinating and repellant in their arrongance, conceit and total selfishness. What is not entertaining and is getting really annoying, is Paige's constant duplicity and lies to people she supposedly likes and trusts. This trait really detracts from her appeal. Since she is both a war widow and 29 yrs. old, this also makes her seem juvenile and silly as well as irresponsible. I hope the author sees fit to make Paige a little more mature in this respect in subsequent books. All in all this was a fun read, and I look forward to more Paige Turner mysteries."
1,Broke after 1 year,"I originally submitted my review at a 1 out of 5; however, after speaking with Canon support, I was surprised they are offering to replace my printer free of charge. Amazon doesn't seem to allow me to update my rating (which i would based on the support call).Ours broke down near the warranty expiration, and Canon is shipping us a new one. I almost didn't call support, thinking we were out of luck -- now I'm glad I did. Canon's support is also first class; I particularly like the feature where they call me back instead of waiting on hold for the next tech rep."
1,paper jam error,"I have always treated my peripherals with care and caution. But now I want to drop-kick this one off of my balcony. It repeatedly gives a paper jam error, even though there is no paper jam. (I have triple-checked.) Numerous advice columns suggest resetting steps, but none of them work. The most likely solution has been posted at fixya, but it entails taking the whole thing apart and using a piece of electrician's tape to improve upon a canon design flaw. For heaven's sake."
1,a piece of crap.,this is not a self setting clock as advertised. then stoped working completely after a few months. do not recommend
2,ppf,"If you are a big fan of the NBA Live series please don't waste your money on this garbage (Not that you would anyway since there is a 2003 version now :P. Just have to get my opinion out). This is the same thing as the 2001 version, except with a new opening movie, and some roster changes, which with a little work, you can make for yourself on the 2001 version (like i did) and save yourself some hard earned cash. NBA 2003 is highly recommended over this P.O.S."
5,The Healing Touch of Mary,"Wonderful book!!! One of the best i seen on Our LAdy for some time. The writing is very good. I would have liked more traditional pictures , but that being said it is treasure of a book. A+"
4,Balanced review of Balancing Bike,"Bought this for my son aged 3.5 but he doesn't enjoy as much as I was certain he would. It's early days yet, and I'm hoping he'll catch on to the principle. He prefers his scooter but this balancing think should be the next step because he's very poor on his ""real"" bike.The thing is very well made, elegant, high quality materials. At any rate, it makes ME happy after dealing with all the low-grade stamped and tube steel junk coming out of China and Toys R Us. For these reasons this would be a perfect toddler gift -- will make you appear thoughtful and tasteful.Now, off to try to get my son to like it again! Maybe a horn...?"
4,Great bike for young kids!,"This bike is great for kids who are not yet old enough to ride a regular bike. Teaches them balance, and they have a blast with it. Seat tore pretty early on, but that's the only real durability issue we've had."
3,alright,"i give it 3.5 stars, that makes it a good album, but not hot. The intro should hype you up, even though they missed out on a lot of 'hoods. I agree with the other reviewers, the beats aren't great, except for ""oochie wally"" and ""street glory"". Those two are bangers....period!!!!.All in all, I think we should focus on lyrics, cuz that's what all QB cats bring to the table. Production and dynamics are more of a West-coast thing."
4,REAL HOT,"THIS ALBUM IS OK IF YOU NEVER HEARD THESE SONG'S. IF YOU WANT REAL QUEENS FLAVA, CHECK OUT NATURAL BORN KILLA'S VOL.1. IT HAS ALL THE QB YOU NEED INCLUDING NEW FLAVA FROM NASHAWN AND HALF A MILL."
1,This game was a dissappointment.,This game was a total let down. The makers went away from what made the other Harvest Moons so great. I would not waste my money if I were you.
3,Back to Nature and A Wonderful Life are better!,"Okay so this game is good, but not awesome. It's one of the more slower moving versions, including walking around or even running. It doesn't have that same ""vibe"" the other versions have (I think because of the way the graphics and layout of it is, maybe?)This is a game for those that enjoy all the Harvest Moon games and really just want to test drive this one for the heck of it. Either way, it's not a bad investment also for those people they know that play ""farmville"" lol trust me, it'll keep those kids busy or the adults in your life too heheHere are the other games of this series that are WAY better:Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life Special EditionHarvest Moon Back to Nature"
4,Great game!,"This game is vey fun and has awesome graphics,but I can't say iit is better than the PS1 version. The flaw with this game is it is very short. I beat it in less than 10 hours of game play. There are 9 endings but it would be boring to go throught it over and over. But,it was very fun,but just too short."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I have Harvest Moon: Back to Nature and it's totally awesome. I was all amped up when i found out there'd be a PS2. I bought it - i was all excited - and it was a flop.Don't get me wrong here - it's actually a fairly decent game. Better than a lot of the mindless garbage out there, anyway. Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to it's psx format.So if you have PS2 and your interested in Harvest Moon, just get Back to Nature. It's a lot better.I personally keep this version, not because I play it anymore, because I like to still be able to say I have every version. But when you get right down to it, it's not an interesting game."
2,Harvest Moon?,When i recenly bought this game i thought this would be like all the other harvest moons where you can get a wife and there are 3 years and u get a little brown dog with a horse and your own farm. Well i was saddly mistaken for you get 1 year to do 1 of 9 of the events and you get no wife you must work for a horse and you must do more just for a dog this game was a very boring game it got old fast and was barely fun i think that natsume took a wrong turn i could see if there were horse races and diffrent events like the other ones but there isnt also you can only build 2 things a kitchen and a dog house big whoop so if i were you maybe possibly rent it BUT DONT BUY IT you will beat it so fast and get bored as fast ...
2,I thought it would be alot better!,"The game had potential.Coming from the N64 verson, it really isn't any better, only worse. The game has the best graphics yet for harvest moon, which really is not saying much anyway. Other than the better graphics, this game lags far behind any other HM game, espicially in price. A definate dont buy, unless you are a die -hard fan of HM..."
3,"Great product, but you pay $$ just for the name","The product works and is a 5 star product, but at a 5 star price. Look around for a generic brand 41% glyphosate for less than half the price and equally as effective. Wish I had before I bought this."
3,frogging around,"Well, I thought this game would be easier :) But that's not a bad thing. The graphics remind me heavily of the beginning computer games where you could constantly get ""stuck"" in some impossible situation and had to reboot the game. In Frogger I more than once trapped myself ""inside"" an open door and could not get out. Similarily the graphics seems to lag when you are moving around fast, so there is definitely some room for improvement. The gameplay itself is pretty fun with frogger being rather cute in his behavior and movements, the cuteness misleads at times when you get stuck and can't figure out how to continue. The store where you can buy items is pretty stupid, it doesn't really help. They should have thought of cooler things to get there. All in all, I think its a good game, but overpriced for what you get, more in the 29.95 range of games."
1,No Way,"I fail to see how Konami could release such a terrible game. Don't even think about renting it because you will want your money back. It's terrible with a capital T. It has the word bad written all over it. Don't even bother to look at the cover, stay far away."
1,Frogger gone bad,"I was a fan of the original frogger games. It had fun arcade style play that was a good time filler. But then when we got this game I just threw it on a shelf after playing five minutes of it. They killed Frogger. They tried to make a good RPG but failed miserably.First of all, the camera [is bad]. You'll be walking around and the camera will be flipping on you then when you dive in water it goes beserk. And the only attack is to spit a blob of who knows what. It stinks. And ditto on the controls. When you jump it is so hard to direct. It took me ten tries to get this crystal from jumping off a block. It is really bad.The only good part (the one star) was the levels, they looked okay.Don't waste your time or precious cash on this piece of junk, it will only make you regret it."
1,Bad Christmas Gift... Not Fun at All...,"I am sad to say that this game is VERY BAD. I had such high hopes being a fan of the last two Frogger games. This game is nearly impossible to control, for an adult or my six year old child (who is normally quite good at these games.) Very little action in this game, it doesn't lay out the point of each board very well, leaving the player roaming around searching for boring little coins and gems. This gets old very quickly. Although my game has never froze as other reviewers have reported, I wish it had. At least that would have been more interesting than playing the game. Bottom line is that this game will get old for nearly everyone within about 15-20 minutes. I wouldn't buy this game again..."
3,Good for beginners,"This game was great for me - but I'm new to 3-D adventure games. Until recently I was playing on a Gameboy Color and avoiding all games in 3-D because they made me dizzy. This game is paced slowly enough that I can actually get used to 3-D gameplay. It's alot of fun but the graphics don't always keep up with the action, several times I've been stuck in a wall for a few seconds because the view didn't update quickly enough. It's also not what I expected when I heard ""Frogger"", I thought I was getting an updated version of the original but it's really a different game playing on the Frogger name. Even so I really like the game and recommend it to those looking for something a little slower-paced."
3,Wendy O. Williams - 'WOW' (Passport),"'Wow' was Wendy O.William's(R.I.P.)first solo effort.Though it's got some bite to it,'Wow' really cannot match up to any of the Plasmatics lp's.It can give the listener(s)a good run for their money.Decent hard rock release.Tunes that I liked the best were ""I Love Sex(And Rock And Roll)"",""It's My Life"",the in-your-mug ""Priestess"",""Bump And Grind"" and ""Legends Never Die"".Line-up:Wendy O.-vocals,Wes Beach-guitar,Reginald Van Helsing(aka Gene Simmons)-bass and T.C.Tolliver-drums.The one time I saw The Plasmatics in concert,I was SO wired after the gig, I honestly couldn't eat or sleep for the next day and a half.All I kept thinking to myself was ""WOW!!"".To this very day,whenever I enter a contest in,say an area newspaper about the most memorable concert I've ever seen,all I need to do is mention Miss William's onstage antics,and my comments usually get printed in the next edition that comes out.Long live Wendy O. and The Plasmatics!!"
4,"They're collets, that's it",They're Dremel so fairly high quality. You need them with any Dremel tool as most kits don't come with the collets.
4,works fine for me,"Not sure what all the fuss is about. This works fine for me. The filter was easy to clean. I did, after a year or so, clean out the inner filter with a toothpick, and it worked like new again. Mine's red, so maybe slightly different model?"
1,Not Worth The Money!!!,"I'm so disappointed with this vacuum!! We purchased it about a year and a half ago and I really regret it. It seemed to work fine at first, but it quickly went downhill from there. For the last several months it's hardly picked up anything at all. We have taken good care of it, checked the hose for clogs, etc. It's just a crappy vacuum.Also, the cord that runs from the vacuum head itself up to the arm of the vacuum has become very loose. It falls out all the time.I knew this vacuum was doomed when my super-thrifty inlaws - who had purchased the exact vacuum months AFTER us - replaced theirs....before us!! They had several of the cheap plastic parts break altogether.Don't waste your money!"
1,ZERO STARS for this horrible vacuum,"This vacuum works fine on hard floors, which it should. It's a vacuum. They shouldn't have even bothered putting a carpet attachment in the package - false advertising on their part. Cleaning out the bagless container is so DISGUSTING that I never want to vacuum. Poor design, terrible vacuum - don't buy it. If I could have given ZERO stars, I would have. Complete waste of money."
1,Don't buy from this company,"I own this vacuum, but I haven't been able to use it for 8 months. The hose melted after it was placed next to a steam pipe (never a problem with Eureka Mighty-Mites) and I have been trying to get a replacement hose from Euro-Pro ever since. Their fulfillment company cannot help: they can only ship when the manufacturer provides them with inventory. I have 9 postcards stating that the item will be shipped in 3-4 weeks. This was my first purchase of a Euro-Pro product and I will never buy another."
4,Great work that rambles some,"I devoured this book for its insights into a period of history hard to lern about: pre-Roman scotland. I left very very informed. Some of the negative reviews have noted that it drifts some, both in terms of subject matter and style. But after you read the first few chapters (which are solid) it is easy to skip through subjects you are not as interested and home in those you are."
4,gave me info to reasons why people act or say things,I chose this rating because of the interesting info in the book.I liked info but felt it was lengthy. I would recommend to everyone!
5,Underlying problems made understandable,"As a therapist I run into people with attachment problems all the time. This book can help professionals and other interested people learn how and why the feel, or don't feel, as they do. Dr. Clinton is an excellent writer and makes the subject interesting and useful for both professionals and non-professionals alike. An excellent and not difficult read."
1,To Easy,This game is way too easy I got it and 2 days afterward I beat it. The spells are cool. But that isnt everything it wasnt what I had hoped for in a Harry Potter Game.
1,Totally Frustrating,"I HATED it. It is way too hard for the biginning gamer...one mistake...and start ALL OVER. I hate to say it, but this is the worst game I've ever had"
2,"Just Put it This Way, Never Buy Movie-Based Games","First off, this game is extremely tedious because the colors are so friggin dark, you can barely tell the difference between the ground and a hole. Also, When sneaking past prefects, it's so dark that you would run into one thinking it's a wall all the time. Second, in the obsticle courses and trials, if you are very far, but die, you have to start all over again with everything back the way it was, unmoved. Third, there is only one boss, and he is very easy. There are more problems with this game, but I don't want to write them all. Overall, DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE TONS OF MONEY TO SPARE!!!"
3,"Not Harry Potter, but pretty close","This game does a pretty good job of sticking to the storyline, and has a creative gameplay. However, it varies from being waaaay too easy, to being far too hard (it literally took me 6 months to complete one task). My advice: buy Chamber of Secrets, it seems to be the superior."
4,a great toy!,"When my husband purchased this book/toy for our 4-year old daughter, I thought it was a ridiculous waste of money. Boy was I wrong! Not a day has gone by in the last 2 months that she hasn't played with this book, and we've bought several more copies as birthday gifts for her friends. Not only a great way to keep a preschooler entertained (great at a restaurant!), she's used the instructions to teach herself how to draw flowers. One word of warning, however: the book says okay to use the makeup on yourself, but we did that once and found it stained her face slightly. (Be advised: this is definitely more toy than book!)"
2,Elementary Information,Not a complete training manuel. Very elementary training. Sit Spot Sit stuff.
4,Great Buy,Recently acquired Casio keyboard with no adapter. Purchased without a hassle and they promptly shipped it to me.
1,Wrong Adaptor,"I, like the other customers. ordered this adaptor based on the recommendation from the site, and was disappointed when, on Christmas Eve, I realized this was not right for the keyboard we had ordered. This situation was particularly misleading since the adaptor was practically ""bundled"" for sale with a product for which it is not compatible."
1,Wrong adapter.,"Amazing, I read all the reviews and ""assumed"" the problem with the wrong adapter was resolved since reviewers have complained since 2003. I ordered the Casio CTK 691 keyboard, clicked on the recommended power adapter and trusted the folks at Amazon knew which model I would need. Wrong, it doesn't fit. Since we bought this keyboard to travel this summer it has been very inconvenient, and we haven't had time to resolve it."
5,Casio Power Adapter,"I received my father's Casio CA-100 keyboard a few months after he passed away, but the power adapter was missing and it had to be a specific item in order to work. Although the keyboard was at least 18 years old and not sold anymore, I found the adapter on Amazon and now it works beautifully. My dad was very musical and I'm glad to have something of his that he enjoyed and that I can enjoy too."
5,Works on CA-100 Casio keyboard too,"I lost the power adapter to my old CA-100 keyboard during a move. Though the product doesn't list this model number, it works with my keyboard just fine."
5,Quick shipping!,"We haven't used the charger yet as it is part of a Christmas present, but I am impressed with the quick shipping."
5,love this game,you remember this game the loop d loop omg this makes me feel like a kid again awsome game love it
2,Where's the fun?,"Yes, some of the stories were good, but even the better ones were uniformly depressing. Please be warned that selection after morbid selection is based on grief-stricken parents and dead, missing, kidnapped and/or murdered and mangled children (sometimes entire pits of them); of the dead children stories, the ""Buckets"" (ghosts of aborted children) offering several other reviewers mentioned was the MOST cheerful. I'm sorry I bought it, and even sorrier that I waded through the entire thing in the hope that there had to be at least one gem of entertainment in there. I like horror as a genre, and rarely part with books, but this one hit the trashcan."
2,Where's The Scares?,"Not here! This is truly a lame anthology.The stories here range from the incomprehensible to the mundane. To say nothing of the anti choice screed by F. Paul Wilson masquerading as a horror story.The Tim Lebbon story is good, and probably the best here. It's very atmospheric but still it's unsatisfying in the end.And MORE THAN HALF of the stuff in here are boring essays and recollections of famous horror authors' own memorable Halloweens.One has to wonder how they make a decent living from their imaginations if these are the most vivid memories of their real lives.The book is really dreck and I suggest anyone looking for something to get really in the Halloween mood (re: seriously scared) give this thing a pass."
3,"Decent, corded vacuum","I've owned this product for over a year now, and while it does very well with picking up stuff on hard surfaces, it really does not do well on carpets, sofas, etc. Some other problems include:1. Very noisy, much louder than even full-size vacuums2. Attachments do not stay on very wellSome pluses are:1. Very lightweight2. Long cord allows for a good reach3. Small, portable sizeOverall, there probably are better ones out there, but if you can get this at a low price (I bought mine when Amazon had it for $5) it's a good, small convenient vacuum for small solid surfaces."
