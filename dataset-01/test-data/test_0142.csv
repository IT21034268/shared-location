5,Ahoy Matey!!,This ship was a Xmas gift for my two year old grandson. It was in excellent condition & delivered promptly. He is having a grand time with it & allows him the puzzle solving along with the imaginary.
5,How Cool Is This?,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my four-year-old son, so he hasn't seen it yet, but I absolutely love this toy! It has many shooting, swashbuckling, and action features, and what is best about it is the packaging! Just imagine, no wire ties, screws and plastic straps to contend with on Christmas morning!"
3,Pirate Ship,The box came a bit damaged but the ship was intact. It would have been nice to include a few more pirates.
2,Not too impressed.,"We have purchased several Imaginext toys for our 3 year old son and so far they all have been great. Up till now we have been very satisfied and they all have been a lot of fun and function perfectly. Sorry to say but we are not very impressed with the pirate ship. Great idea but it is very limited in what ""it dose"" and the few functions that it has do not work very well. I think that they could have done a better job in the design and could have made it so that it would be a lot more fun and functional. We bought the Research Boat at the same time and it is A LOT BETTER. The pirate ship just sits while the other boat gets played with everyday. Would not recomend this as a primary toy and would instead buy the Reasearch Boat."
4,Grandsons delight,This was a great purchase for my 3 year old grandson. He loves pirates and plays with this all the time. It sparks his imagination and teaches him about ships. Its quite durable and worth the cost.
5,"Lots of fun, and very durable","We bought this pirate ship in October 2007, and haven't had any of the problems with it coming apart that some earlier reviewers mentioned. (Perhaps the 2007 version is improved?) We're actually very happy with this toy--it is very well designed, with just the right balance between functionality and durability. There are lots of things to do (raise/lower the sails, the anchor, fire the canons three different ways, etc.), and everything works well and holds up to the normal amount of abuse that a four-year-old and his 2-year-old brother can dish out. One of our kids' favorite toys, and one of ours as well."
2,"Rich in data, poor in analysis","This book is an empirical critique of Puerto Rico's development program called Operation Bootstrap. The authors use abundant census data to depict the contradictory socioeconomic trends induced by the island's industrial development. Analytically, the authors straddle between a view of Puerto Rico as a developing economy and as a regional economy of the United States. This ambiguity leaves the reader wondering whether the paradox is the product of methodological inconsistencies or of the reality of Puerto Rico as an unicorporated territory of the United States."
4,Good deal on a good product,Perfect size for a full size truck. Flaps are well made and easy to install with the help of a flat parking spot and a small level.These plasticolor mud flaps have the 100mph test as well as the automatic car wash so they are good to go.Amazon.com was offering a $30 or so credit to orders when I got mine so it made it a very sweet deal
5,dodge ram logo mud guards,"these flaps do the job very well, they were easy to install and they look good."
5,Dodge,"These mud flaps were an easy install, quick delivery, and they look good on our dodge ram 1500. And the price was right."
2,Western digital? I have very little faith in them,"After crashing two hard disks the same day for no reason, I lost all my confidence in this company. The sad part I lost my back up of huge file cache. All my MP3s, pictures, documents, legal docs etc.I bought seagate and Fantom drives. I am happy now."
3,"Great at the beginning, awful at the end",After 6 months of happiness my drive is having lots of problems. I'm getting lots of blue screens and auto disks scans. I'm gonna go buy a different one.
2,Western Digital WD2500JB Hard Drive,"I purchased this drive on August 4, 2012 and installed about 8 days later. I use it as a backup drive with a program called Smartsync. All was fine until Friday, September 21, 2012 when it started failing with write failures. Then soon after (hours) it was 'Device not Responding'. Now the description did say it was used and most of the reviews for used drives were not high I bought anyway. I guess I should have heeded the reviews. I took a chance and lost."
3,"Great pickin, but overbearing religiosity","Great fingerpicking, as is to be expected from Jorma. Unfortunately, he's found God in a big way and feels compelled to beat the listener over the head with the ""good news."" Ugh...."
3,Fireflys have never been more interesting,Facts about Fireflys are woven into this compelling story of young girl looking for the screwed up drug addict mother who abandoned her 8 years earlier. Stories from the point of view of the Mother and Grandmother are woven in. A sotry of love and understanding even when there is no happily ever after. A different type of book than I would normally choose it was a good read.
3,"Well written and interesting, but didn't hold me","The other reviewers have said pretty much everything about this book. It's an interesting tale which covers a broad range of life lessons; coming of age, abstinence, drug and alcohol abuse, racism, prostitution, paranoid schizophrenia, etc... The book is very well written; Reynolds no doubt has a true gift for writing. BUT... the story did not grab me like other ""great"" books I have read. I never felt like I had to get to the next part of the story.See, to me, a great book is one that I mourn once it is over because I don't want the story to end. This book never felt like that to me. I enjoyed the story but I was ready to move on to something else by the end.Overall, it was a good experience to me but I enjoyed ""The rapture of Canaan"" much more. Thanks for reading my two cents."
3,Gore & Plot...Way Cool !,"So,The government trained this guy and then let him go...As a civilian ?Incredible tortures,deaths and clues up the wazoo.Whoever this actor (Steve Furedy) is,He definitely does killer well...Looks kind of like Willie Nelson and Jerry Garcia -ish.The detectives are the case bring new meaning to Good Cop & Bad Cop.Grisly special effects that make you wince and yet,Cannot wait to see what the Bad Guy will do next.All principals have many credits and it shows all true professionals and beleive in their craft.Ending made one long for ""Good Guys Wear Black"" with Chuck Norris in his debut performance."
3,ok,im a HUGE fan of shock its my fav adult film of ALL time and the soundtrack is scorching but this just has too many dirty lines and bad production dont stand up to the scorching quality of the movie i reccomend watching shock NOT buying this copy cd from it and the songs are simply short versions and NOT as good as the real thingi LOVE the title and this music does have some great themes its probably the BEST porn soundtrack of all time
1,Grinding Motor,"I Have An early model Mangavox Rotator and have been pleased with it. So when needed one for my mountain cabin ,I decided on this make.This one works OK ,but the motor sounds like its grinding corn.I would not buy another like this."
3,Attack of the 50ft. Woman,"Nancy Archer (Darryl Hannah) is a rich but troubled young woman, who is married to a cheating lowlife who only stays with her for her money. One night, she is driving home by herself, when an alien spaceship lands on the road. She is irradiated by the ship and over the next few days, starts to grow taller and taller, until she reaches a height of 50 feet. She uses her newfound height (and power) to take revenge on those who have wronged her - especially her sleazy husband Harry (Daniel Baldwin) and the trashy, gold-digging bimbo (Christi Conaway) he has taken up with.This HBO made-for-cable remake of the 1957 cult classic of the same name is updated with an even more feminist slant and has a more thoughtful (and clever) script. The effects and acting are still every bit as cheesy though."
4,Essential reading for press scholars,"This book is essential reading for anyone who is interested in the history of the First Amendment. Levy is the starting point for debate on what freedom of the press meant to the framers of the first amendment. Levy contends that the framers had a very limited conception of freedom of the press, and presents a wealth of evidence of suppression of press freedoms in colonial America. There is a wealth of interesting information in this book, although it is not casual reading by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, many scholars have criticized Levy for ignoring both the actual practices of colonial printers--who behaved as if they were quite free despite the law--and for ignoring the philosophical contributions of English Whig thinkers to the American conception of press freedom. In my view, you have to start with Levy if you are interested in this topic, but you shouldn't stop with him."
1,not what I expected,"This gate only will work if the space you want to block off is in even inches. The lock only works for even space, so for example, if you need to close off an area that is 24.5"", the choice you get is 24"" or 25"". 24"" inches won't work, and 25"" inches is bigger than the space, so that doesn't work. I pretty much just lean it against a door frame and then put something against it to keep it there. I wouldn't buy this product again."
5,Just what I needed,"I needed a barricade of some sort to separate four cats from an active beagle. This does the trick. It has allowed them to get used to each other while protecting the cats and the beagle. This works perfectly and is easy to open, adjust and close. Thank you!"
4,One for the collections.,"I love Plasticolor products, I have matching steering wheel cover and floor mats in my Colorado. It comes with plenty of screws, which one this company some points. it's not the best looking mudflaps I've every seen, but they come pretty close."
2,Library Clerk,"I found this book quite outdated since libraries are now automated. This book refers a lot to card catalog which are no longer used. Everything is done on online catalogs. I work in a school library and a lot of the subjects didn't have anything to do with my job. You really had to read the questions carefully to understand, at times, what they wanted you to do."
1,Outdated - it's like going back in time,"This is a re-issue of a book published in 1993. That's not made very clear in the sales blurb. So you'll be reading about light-therapy and float-tanks and other old news. Lots of generalities and stereotypes - e.g. taking the subways makes people feel stressed; spiritual feelings in the countryside or in the mountains. Lots of details about life in Alaska. Unless you're planning on living in Alaska, or on a mountain peak, there's nothing useful here. Nothing really about ""place""."
2,The Power of Place,"This book was inconclusive and somewhat confusing. If someone is really looking for information to help make a choice concerning home or vacation locations, I don't think this is the book to read. There was some interesting data, but most studies had counter-studies that left the reader ""noplace""."
5,great example of singing talent that's timeless.,"This CD shows off the dynamic talents of Miss Lee to the full. Her superlative renditions, together with fabulous arrangements and superb backing makes ALL of her recordings great buying for just great music. Long may she reign over music."
4,Still going strong after 2.5 years!,"I didn't expect this gate to last more than a few months after it showed up because it seemed so flimsy. I put it up anyway because I needed a gate ASAP and much to my surprise it is still going strong after 2.5 TOUGH years of use. We use it at the top landing of our staircase and it works great. My daughter has given it many tugs and some full-on body checks and it just flexes out a bit then pops back in line. The expandable top rail prevents much sway and keeps hands from getting pinched, I would not use an accordion gate that did not have a top rail for added stability. Make sure you hang it low so no space below would allow a toddler escape.One-half star off for the metal hooks bending with use, but they have not broke at all so fingers crossed. One-half star off for clamp being a bit tough to work with one hand, but it is doable.Lets hope it lasts through our son too, he is 6 months so i will update this review as he gets older."
2,Terrible latch hardware,I've used a lot of these gates for both children and pets. My satisfaction is usually dominated by how easy they are to operate. This is the worst one I've used. I am physically strong but cannot compress the latch spring without using two hands. The latch components are cheap and ill fitting. I doubt many mothers could operate it with a baby in one arm.
4,gate,"works as advertised, easy to follow directions, larger eye screws might work a little better when singing gate to walk through."
3,Re-Hash of previously issued tracks with precious little new,"This compilation is basically a pick-and-chose of the tracks found in the Hanna Barbera Pic-a-nic Basket and other previously issued CD.s, with a very few previously unreleased tracks such as 'Penelope Pitstop' and 'The Wacky Races'. If you are a big fan of this music (as I am), get the Pic-a-Nic Basket and you get everything. If you want just the basics, then get this."
3,Acceptable,"After Restless and Wild was released, the dam broke and Accept started getting much more attention. Contains the song ""Fast as a Shark"", perhaps one of the first speed metal songs ever featuring drummer Stefan Kaufmann using double bass drums. Wolf Hoffman's guitar playing is awsome. Udo's shriek is annoying sometimes, but grows on you. Some of Accept's songs have a classical influence to them which I enjoy. Only downer about this particular CD is there are a few production flaws; some of the guitar and drum tracks on a couple of songs are too dry, i.e. they sound kinda like demos...which is odd because not all of the songs on the CD are like that. Also the ending of the song Princess of the Dawn is chopped off. Maybe they were rushed to get this album out. They wouldn't make the same mistake on the next one though (Balls to the Wall)."
4,balls out,"the first track,fast as a shark was one of the first speed metal songs ever,accept are not a speed metal band though.I bought this in 82 and when this came out it was golden.accept progessively got worse in their career in my opinion,this is their best,the rest of the album is also good,this is a good solid 80`s real metal disc."
4,"Miss Loren in an acceptable version of Molnar's ""Olympia""","Fluffy costumer with Sophia Loren, based on Ferenc Molnar's ""Olympia"" (and originally filmed in 1929 as ""His Glorious Night"").Beautiful and unorthodox Princess Olympia (Sophia Loren) throws tradition to the wind and falls in love with handsome American industrialist Charlie Foster (John Gavin).Fine supporting performances from Maurice Chevalier as Prince Philip and a striking Angela Lansbury as Countess Lina. With Isabel Jeans in a delightful cameo. As one would expect, the costumes are sumptuous; both Miss Loren and Miss Lansbury look radiant in their array of gowns. The DVD offers no extras whatsoever, but the 16:9 transfer looks a treat.They don't make them like this anymore!"
1,Don't buy it!,"We purchased this two years ago for the same price and have felt ripped off ever since. I can't believe it is still on the market. It does not do what an almost $80 piece of equipment should do. It barely improves the reception. Keep shopping for a better quality antenna. There is no ""Pin-Dot Pre-Tuning"" with this hunk of junk."
1,Doesn't really work,"Didn't seem to make the FM reception any better, except for the fact that when I was trying to get the classical station from NYC, to my horror, I got loud and clear, the local Christian station. Not what I wanted. The AM reception was completely gone; I went back to the antenna which came with the Onkyo tuner, which sort of works. I didn't have much luck with the ""pin the dot"" tuning system. More gain just made it more static-y (with more pain).Bottom line will be an attempted return to CC; we'll see how that goes."
4,Entertaining,"Enjoyable. Good natured, for the most part, with a redemptive story. Would NOT recommend it for children or even early teens due to language and implied pre-marital relations."
3,Cute,"Very cute product. I made mine cuter by adding cut foam pieces as sprinkles, but everyone then thought I was a cupcake. Kinda foamy/cheap looking, but for the price, it's a deal."
3,"OK, but not great","I installed it on my Dodge Grand Caravan. It works. There were some non-critical quality control issues that seem to be typical of Monroe parts. For example, one of the three mounting bolts was longer than the others on one of the 2 mounts I bought. It still worked, but seemed shoddy.The strut bearing on one side is squeaking after a while. That may be my fault, if I over-torqued the strut. I am not counting that against Monroe. Learn from my mistakes... make sure you use a torque wrench when installing these."
5,Thoughtfully Illustrated and Written,The illustrations in particular are excellent in this book on goddesses - don't miss Mother Durga. The writeups are brief but a good introduction for those who might want to delve in deeper after they've found their interest.
1,could be altered,"this could be altered art, alternative spirituality goddess religions are being attacked, the picture on the front has being altered to look evil and sallow, art is being altered and certain individuals who are targets or whole groups could be getting altered art. I've gotten cards, images and even posters statues are being altered. If you get a changed copy, you are probably being targeted by male supremacists and they're regime and secret - and not so secret - brotherhoods. If you want to fight back, please help us find a way to guard art online and in print and media. They control much of it. So.... fairy art, goddess art, and others are all under attack."
3,Book quality good,"Sound advice. Quotes experts in the field who have also written books, which I have read."
2,So what do I do about it,"My Mother gave me this book. Said it had changed her life and I have seen significant changes in her dealing with anger. However, after reading the book...I don't get it. Rubin points out a lot of ways that anger manifests itself. Many of which I was aware of, some not. Unfortunately he never tells you how to go about recognizing and expressing your anger and feeling okay with that. He only tells you that you are better off doing so. Luckily it was a quick read."
2,Good scratching...when you can find it,"Like the other discs in this series, this one features the best turntablists in the world spinning non-stop beats and scratch theory totally disrupted by WAY too-much non-sensical ""rapping"" that doesn't elevate the tracks in ANY way. Maybe they felt that no one would tune in to a radio broadcast of pure turntable action without some kind of grounding vocalisms, but it was just distracting. Get Q-bert's solo efforts or the World Famous Beat Junkies instead...at least until they put out a Pikles disc that doesn't have the ""rapping"" on it."
1,READ ABOUT DR MARTENS FIRST!!!!!,"Do some research before buying Dr Martens and DO NOT buy sight-unseen from an online store unless you really know what you are doing. That said, read on...Dr Martens USED TO BE an amazing shoe company. This is when they were all made in England. If you are fortunate enough to find a pair that say on the inside heel: made in England, AND on the bottom of the shoe, you see the same phrase, these are the real deal. Otherwise, they are cheap junk. Google about it online. Get the ones made in England and you won't be sorry. Get the ones made elsewhere, and well, you WILL be sorry.How do I know? Well, I am 26 years old and I still wear a pair of DOCS that I wore when I was in 11th grade. The sole is worn down only about 1/3rd of what it was when I first purchased them. They are incredibly well-made shoes."
2,Ouch!,"I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am ""ticked"" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them. Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now......."
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"I really, really enjoyed this book. The first dinner scene had me laughing out loud on the train ride home. What an absolute, but completely welcome surprise. I didn't quite enjoy the conflict between Alix and Alex; it was a bit too contrived for my taste, but overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable novel."
3,Unlikely couple,Like many of the other reviewers I could not see these two leads as a realistic couple. They are exact opposites. I realize this sometimes works but it never worked for me in this book. She is irritating. Everyone once & a while she is funny & quirky.The male Alex was sometimes boring & a stick in the mud but at least he seemed to be sane. The female Alix is just a mess. I found myself reading fast just to get to the end of the story. I will admit that I have read this book a while ago. Maybe I enjoyed it more the first time. I couldn't really remember it so I trudged through it again.
3,Improper American maybe,"I was initially draw to this book because it is about an American woman and an English guy (I am a sucker for the English accent). While I find the book in places to be amusing, I thought the leading female character, Alix, was just too much. She was so outlandish in her actions at times that I was wanting to say, ""Girl, get some sense into you."" The last few chapters were somewhat redeeming for the book because at least she made some improvements to herself.All in all the book was not that bad. It is just the initial actions of Alix that made me want to put the book down a few times."
2,Not that great,"I like Godzilla, but this movie was a letdown. It was boring and weird (weird confusing, not weird awesome.) The monster designs were very good, and so were the FX. The battles were good, too, even if they were just laser light shows."
5,Godzilla at his Best!,"This film, the sequel to GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE, is one of the very best of Toho's series. It begins with a very impressive musical score, and the arrival of people from the future. They say Godzilla will arise and lay waste to Japan, and ultimately the world. So, they go back to remove the Godzillasaur from Lagos Island(which is where he'll become Big-G)in place of the dinosaur, three dorats are placed on the island. The creatures become King Ghidorah. To defend Japan from Ghidorah's wrath, Godzilla is reborn(100 meters!)The monsters fight, and at the end it is MechaKing Ghidorah that delivers the final blow to Godzilla who is attacking Japan. A very good movie! Highly reccommended for Ghidorah and Godzilla fans!"
3,Okay!,"The mud flaps were for the back tires and easy to install. Wanted them to protect my travel trailer and they do. Not as durable as I expected as no longer hang straight. Not bad, but they have bent from wind and heat."
2,"I love Dr. Laura, Was a little disappointed w/this book","I love Dr. Laura and her frank no-nonsense advice. I really liked Stop Whining Start Living and I bought it for several of my friends who have also gotten a lot out of that book. I was excited to read this book (not because I thought my marriage needed help, but because I thought there's nothing wrong with trying to make it even better!), but got discouraged and was disappointed immediately. By the time I got to the second chapter, I actually had to put it down. I don't think she is very realistic in this book and I don't think there can be cookie-cutter advice for everyone reading. I don't agree with the theory that men can do no wrong, that they are simple creatures, and it is up to the women to make the relationship successful (by having more sex, cooking dinner, whatever). I'm not giving up on Dr. Laura and am going to start reading another one, but I was disappointed with this one."
3,The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage,"I love Dr. Laura's radio show, but this book was a disappointment. It is badly written and there are several grammatical mistakes and lots of badly phrased sentences. As for the content, Dr. Laura is recycling her two latest books - _The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands_ and _Bad Childhood - Good Life_. Nothing new in this book and not worth the money. Get it at the library or skim through it at the bookstore; 15 minutes is all you need."
2,Arrived Damaged,"The moment I saw the box on the front porch it screamed CHINA. I could tell by the dent on the side of the box that there would be damage. Once I opened the box and saw the subset of two boxes inside along with the MINIMAL styrofoam, I knew there would be damage.I opened the table box and the first thing that I saw was the corner of the table dented and the pressed wood was separating.I ordered this, the rocking chair and the storage chest. After reading the one honest review for the storage chest I came to the realization that whoever called this heirloom quality may have been paid to leave their response. I'm still not completely sure how you ""carve"" pressed wood.Initially I ordered a replacement but considering the lack of packing I have no idea how this could ever arrive to anybody undamaged.I'd rather have something made of solid wood that will hold up to the abuse of the projected user."
2,What a disappoiontment!,"Having read ""The Shell Seekers"" many years ago, I was looking forward to a rewarding summer read. There was much potential in each of the characters but very little development, with the minor exception of Lucy.Everything was entirely to predictable and tied together much to neatly.I would not spend the money on the hardcover version-wait for the paperback!"
5,Winter Solstice,Rosamunde at her usual best. Interesting characters and life situations developed to keep the reader from wanting to put the book down. A lovely read! Hope to see more Rosamunde Pilcher novels available on Kindle in the near future.
4,Great Book,"This is possibly my favorite of Rosamunde Pilcher's books, although I've loved them all. I guess that's why I keep going back and re-reading them."
3,Fun but predictable!,"As usual, her characters are interesting, but I found this plot to be a bit too far fetched and predictable. I do love her happy endings."
2,Not up to Pilcher's standards.,"I have read a few other books by this author and and found them to be engrossing reads. I want to say to anyone who is thinking of reading Winter Solstice to instead read her outstanding Coming Home instead. That is one of my aboslute favorites and is vastly superior!I was eager to read this newer novel , but saved it to enjoy around the holidays. I just could not be absorbed by this and found my self not really caring about the outcome. The characters lacked any depth, growth, and development. The story line was terribly slow and meandering. You realize how lacking a novel is when the most intersting character is Horace the Dog! A great disapointment.Pilcher is capable of so much more."
2,So-So,"This foam roll gets the job done at first, but after frequent use the foam breaks down and the roll becomes indented in areas where repeated pressure is applied. A better choice is the EVA (extra dense) kind, which will hold up much better over time."
4,It's a piece of foam,"Like the title says, it's just a piece of foam. I think I paid around $30 for this, and I'm guessing it's mainly for the nice cloth cover over the foam. The product works as described. It does feel like a massage. However, I think the cover is pretty worthless, and you should just buy the foam if it costs less than this outfit. The cover makes it very slippery, so it makes it near impossible to use on carpet alone. I tried a yoga mat, but it's still slightly slippery, though more tolerable. Regardless, I'm happy with it because I feel it really does help my back."
4,"Read this book! Better yet, purchase the audiotape!","This book is wonderful, especially for New Agers and/or recovering New Agers. If you love Richard Bach books, I guarantee that you will at least strongly LIKE this book. Aside from the author's questionable taste in men, this young woman has tapped into great ideas - truths - about how to be happy. Really...buy it. You'll like it!"
3,"It matches, but....","I bought this and was a little disappointed in a couple of things.First, I will say it makes the room look more put together, BUT it doesn't play for such a long time. If it were battery operated, it would be a much better value than the wind up mechanism. The other thing is that my daughter,who is 12, attempted to wind it with one had and the mobile fell off onto my friends daughter's baby!Luckily, the baby was fine and not directly underneath it. Lesson learned-wind with both hands on this mobile!!....I will echo the previous reviewer who recommended buying something else if you don't care about the match.Wish I'd tried this in the store before I'd bought it(it was sold out at the BRU store,bought it off of this website.)"
4,A memorable performance,"Paul Newman gives one of the most memorable performances ever in thisentertaining and riveting piece of drama about legendary boxer RockyGraziano. This is one of the finest of Newman's films, and it's oneof my favorite films of all time. Excellent."
2,Easy to fall asleep whilst reading,"This book whilst coming from a wonderful stable, I found dissapointing. The content was nothing more than a group of short stories, which while being fairly interesting in themselves, had the result of carving potentially good stories into small appetizers. As interest built in a character the story would come to the end, which caused me frustration. Not one of Silverberg's better books."
1,utter drivel,"The writing, plot, dialogue and character ""development"" were so appalling I only read this to see how much worse it could possibly get--and it did! Don't even bother to carry this one home from the library."
4,Time for re-election,"Stuart Woods has finally returned to past success. This book is a dramatic improvement over the Dirty Works novel.While this book has a number of flaws, it maintains a good pace. The storyline is interesting. The one disappointing aspect of this book is that it does not center around Will Lee or his wife. Rather the focus is on the Deputy FBI Director, Robert Kinney. One has the feeling that this person will become the focus in future books.I listened to this on audio cassette. The reader was adequate. However, there are a number of individuals capable of performing at a much higher level."
4,Very Good Read!,"Even though Will Lee didn't feature prominent in this novel, the little he did was very enjoyable. The story was interesting and fast paced. Everyone involved did a wonderful job, especially Kinney. I don't think we've seen the last of him or Fay. I'd love to see them again in a future novel."
1,Poor or no service,I have never received this book. If you would read my comments you would know this. I want my money back.Arbie Herring985 847 0905
2,not the size advertised,"I ordered a 6"" x 12"" x 1/2"" piece of black acetal. I got a 5.8"" x 11.8"" x 1/2"" piece. I'll make it work, but don't appreciate the undersized piece. Guess that's why they call it small parts."
3,Disappointed With Production,"...Maybe it's because technology has come so far in the last decade, (Yes, that must be it) but I was very disappointed in this poor production.I had high expectations, based on the reviews I read.I applaud all those who were involved in this project for their desire and efforts to spread the Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for NOTHING is more crucial to our world today than God's True Agape Love. But, in my opinion, Almighty God deserves a higher effort.The message itself is highly accurate, and THAT is the most important thing. As a teaching tool, this film can be very useful. But the acting, the tone, the pace & delivery of the dialogue, and the overall production is quite dry and slow. If you're looking to be ""entertained"", this is not the production for you.PRAISE THE LORD OF GLORY!!!"
2,"Inadequate acting, very bland!","While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!"
3,Interesting but Confusing,"I'm really just beginning with this book, but it is already frustrating. Some reasons: Measurements are given oddly, like 1/2 pound flour, 2 glasses water. There will be an instruction to ""bake"" without mention of temperature or time. There will often be ingredients in the list which are not mentioned in the instructions. It seems to me that it was written as a technical reference for someone that already knew what they were doing in this cuisine. I strongly recommend that in future editions there be some editing and clarification done along with translation."
2,"Toshiba's portfolio, not such an intuitive idea","Bought this portfolio for my Toshiba tablet PC, thinking it will make it easier to carry and hold the tablet PC.Pros:It's a good way to carry and protect the PC when not in use, provided you don't have anything else to carry along, such as the power cable and other accessories, as there is no room for that.Cons: Trying to use the tablet PC with this portfolio only makes it bulkier, and heavier to carry. In addition, this portfolio leaves you no room to carry anything else.Bottom line, save your money and buy a regular notebook case to protect and carry your tablet PC. It's not worth it."
2,"Great set, terrible acting","Having seen Hallmark's production of The Odyssey, I expected this version of Jason and the Argonauts to meet those same standards. It didn't! Alessandro plays such a great Odysseus, and I think this is what makes that version of the Odyssey so great. The settings and effects are okay, but it's good because of the excellence the actors use in playing the characters. Hallmark's Jason and the Argonauts has a great set with good costumes etc., but Jason and Orpheus are terribly misrepresented by the actors in this film! Jason and Orpheus are perhaps two of the most important characters, yet they are portrayed by the worst actors in the film. I'm sorry, but a great set simply cannot make up for this."
1,Great Mythological Story/Bad Director!,"I enjoy Greek Mythology and I love this story. Although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character Jason, who acted like he was stoned throughout the film. I was expecting the Hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized Komoto Dragon(Lost me there) This Film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip. Overall I was dissappointed and was expecting more. Sorry!"
1,What a Dud!!!,"I ordered the movie, ""Jason and the Argonauts"" to show my class of sixth grade students. We are studying Greek mythology and I thought they'd get a kick out of watching some of the movies from back in the day on the subject. Today, I chose to show this movie to my class and it was terrible. The movie kept skipping and was unwatchable. I can't begin to say how embarrassed I was after all the bragging I'd done about this movie. The copy I received is only good for one thing: the trash can and I will be asking for my money back. I'm very disappointed to say the least."
4,HOT,"This album is a really good one from Killah Preist. I do not suggest it for everyone though because it is a deep, thinking mans album. there is no rah-rah. just Hard beats and even harder lyrics. I would buy the cheapest album you can find from killa preist and see if you feel him first. (he never came out with a wack album) and if you can comprehend it then buy all of his albums..."
3,Satisfied,"Recently purchased as my first ""real compass"". For the price, you can't go wrong. Durable housing with heft that suggests quality construction. On the down side, very slow to North. Like I said though, if you are going to be a critic then go spend $100+ on a unit."
4,The Shaker...,"I like this for the most part. It leaks a little when you shake it and a little hard to open and close, but it does the job. I'm pretty easy to please."
2,"Leaking cap, too small","I've used a variety of shakers and never had a problem until I came across this one. First, the container is fairly small. If you're using 2 scoops of protein for a serving then there just isnt enough room for the right amount of liquid with it. Second, the cap always catches liquid in it and will drip on you when you're drinking. The only way to avoid that is to soak it up with a paper towel, which in my opinion is too much effort. And no, you can't really shake it out of the cap before you open it."
1,Double Indemity,Double indemity written by James M. Cain is a well written mystery.The point that brings a strange reality when the protagonist Mr.Huff realizes that he has killed for nothing but lust for Mrs.Nirdliner.Anyone who loves suspence you should pick up this book for the simple reason this book has plenty of it .Personally this book didn't appeal to me because the ending was lacking that great ending but this book is still well written.
5,A Must Read,"I don't usually read or like hard boiled detective mysteries, but this book is really good. I liked the period in which the story takes place. I liked the insurance investigation.After reading this book I had to see the movie on video. It was also very good, but much darker than the book.I will deinitely look for and read more books by this author."
3,Didn't like them...,"These strings sounded very dull. The trebles were huge and stiff -- so stiff, in fact, that it was a little difficult to get them tied at the bridge.They do deserve props for tuning stability, and they start to hold a tune well pretty quickly after installation.But, for me the dull tone of the trebles was an issue. The only others I've played that were this dull were theD'Addario EJ25B Pro-Arte Black Nylon Composite Flamenco Guitar Stringsflamenco strings by D'Addario. My favorite string manufacturer, and usually I play D'Addarios, but not those.I know some folks like that, but I like a bit of brilliance in the trebles for my own playing.I replaced these strings with EJ45's about 3 days after I installed them."
4,Revolutionary Brotherhood,"Dr. Bullock, a non-Mason, casts a keen historical eye over this important period of our American history and adroitly explains Freemasonry'sconsiderable part in it that it played. A must read for Masons and non-masons alike."
3,Mainstream Masonic History,"Revolutionary Brotherhood is a mainstream history of American Freemasonry from 1730-1840. Although he does cover the anti-Masonry political party he either ignores or quickly blows off most of the conspiratorial claims about Freemasonry. One thing he does do a good job of is showing how there are huge differences between various lodges and not all are under the same umbrella. There is also huge debate within the lodges as what Freemasonry and its true purpose actually is. As thick academic history books often are, this is dull at times. However you do get plenty of good information in this both from a mainstream historians perspective and from someone that sees Masonry in a more conspiratorial light."
4,Very good product,"I got it yesterday and am very happy with the purchase. It has 8 ports, 5 under protected and 3 under grounded. Cord is lengthy too. Hope it lives up to the expectations and provides a good cushion to the electrical fluctuations. Great buy!!!"
4,same bag as Jack Bauer,"I bought this item for school. It is pretty durable for its price and the drab olive color allows it to be matched well with most things. The velcro meant to hold the cover flap in place is useless and gets in the way a bit, but fortunately it's function is superfluous anyways (the heavy canvas keeps itself shut). The color on the outside did fade quite a bit after a few months of casual inddor/outdoor use. If you are looking to carry a water bottle, the side pockets are almost too narrow for disposable plastic bottles. Overall the durability and functionality of the bag paired with its relatively low cost made me quite happy and I would recommend it to anyone looking for such qualities."
3,"Sturdy bag, but will leave black residue on your stuff.","This bag seems great at first! And for the most part...it is. However, I just feel like it's my duty to relay one piece of information about this bag that has caused me to have to buy a different bag. This WILL leave black residue on your books, papers etc. It's not a lot, but if you put a paperback book in this back expect some black markings on it that are slight, but noticeable.I've washed this bag a few times, and it still persists. I carry documents that cannot have black marks on it so I needed a new bag.However, if your'e just throwing your laptop in here and carrying it, it's probably going to work for you."
3,Okay,"It was a good bag, but very cheap material. You do get your money's worth though. Had it for about 2 month and the straps and bag is ripping. I use this bag for school, binder and book corners are the main reason why its ripping."
2,Flowerbomb,"I love the aroma of this parfum. However, it said that a sprayer would be included but it did not come with the package!!! Very disappointing!!!"
1,Beware fake perfume,"My wife has worn this scent for years and we have extra bottles at home. I got this for her and when it arrived it is a fake horrible knock off!!! The bottle is close but wrong. The metal label is glued on loosely and crooked. The pump spray is cheap and weak, and the perfume color is wrong and scent is wrong!! Beware do not buy this from this retailer! We still have the perfume we haven't returned it yet. But we will and we want our money back. I have never returned anything on amazon, but I have heard it is easy. We like Amazon and will continue to shop here but not from this particular perfume retailer."
1,old parfume,"This product arrived in time promised. However, it seemed off color and not the actual perfume. The color is very gold and not petal pink. I wear this all the time and the smell of this purchase seems old or stagnant. Not pleased."
1,Overpriced shower cleaner,"Only $800? And I've saved $800 too? All for a perfectly NORMAL, small and easily obtained for about 1/10 the price elsewhere. Don't know who these idiots are fooling."
2,Show Too Slow,"I don't mind subtitles. I don't mind coming of age movies. I don't mind movies about the misfit and the popular who get together. This movie is about all the above, and for me it was too slow. The story line has been seen over and over again. I had a hard time not wanting to kick the young girl underdog. Hey, get your head out of your ass. Her style grated. There's a scene where she disses a disabled girl. I don't see how that moved the story along. Basically, the movie irritated me. But there are a lot of reviews that say how great the movie is, just not for me."
5,Vintage Moodysson...,"Show Me Love is a fantastic Swedish import from 1998. It is a simple, warm-hearted story about two young girls living in a small, remote town in Sweden (""Amal""). As they fight boredom and peer pressure, popularity differences and the stigma of homosexual love, the two sense an attraction, but for a long time, don't know what to do about it, if anything, and/or how to deal with the feelings that crop up.Really though, this film is for everyone. It is more about being yourself (becoming yourself?), and being true to yourself, and following your heart, no matter who you are, or who you love.I highly recommend this movie, and it is truly one of my favorites! If you liked this one, see Together! Also a great film. Five stars."
5,an all-time favorite,"This is an honest, heartfelt coming of age story. It is incredibly sweet, with many uncomfortable moments that everyone can relate to."
4,short and sweet,ok... short and sweet because the movie is short. it just started to get so good and it ended abruptly with the characters talking about chocolate milk... not that it is bad at all. the movie trully depicts the hurdles of teenage gay realizations. i for one had the same experience. i highly recommend this movie to everybody who is willing to understand the minds of teenagers. it sure answered a lot of questions on my part... 8)
4,This is a cute movie!,"Get over the subtitles and this is a awesome movie! It's so cute and sad and happy! The subtitles aren't bad to read either. Alot of foriegn lesbian films are better in my opinion, and this is a must have!!!! It was very popular in Europe when it came out."
1,They're no different than any other whiney emo band out there,"""____sound just like____and every other band being jammed down your throat on the radio. They stole their sound from___who took their sound from____. They whine just like that band____on that major label___records. You can fill in the blanks, and write your own review. You don't even have to use this band's name. They're no different than any other whiney emo band out there. I did like the song ""Postpartum Modesty"""
3,Not for hard cheeses like cheddar(?),"This is the second one that I've purchased after breaking the first one. These are fine for soft cheeses like havarti or muenster, that you may slice a few pieces for a party but using this as a daily slicer to slice cheddar for sandwiches is not going to ""cut it."" It is a great concept but to really be durable and functional, it would need to be solid stainless with a replaceable wire. More expensive, yes, fewer purchased, yes. It would no longer be necessary to replace them every two months after the thing snaps in your hand."
5,Grass String Ranch,I have only recently 'discovered' the Kentucky boys and I think they are great.I am only sorry that I didn't cotton on to them earlier.
1,GARBAGE! IS A BETTER WORD FOR THESE DVD'S,"IT'S NOT WORTH THE FRUSTRATION.... IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE THESE DVD'S.... DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, TOSS THEM. THEY ARE NO GOOD! I PURCHASE A 100 PACK... SO FAR, 1 OUT OF TEN DVD'S WILL BURN CORRECTLY."
1,disappointed,"I had no problem with the silver back memeorex, but when I bought these with my top of the line $2000 HP laptop, I keep getting coasters in 4 and 2.4 speeds, whats going on>??????????????????"
2,Memorex 4 X DVD+R White Inkjet Printable,"I have been using these discs for several months now. The performance of the last batch I received was poor. They expanded the printable surface to cover more of the disc (the Center). All of a sudden (after the change) I started burning coasters. I then ordered some Ridata discs and have had great performance from them. However, Amazon does not identify their Media very well (Model Numbers, etc) and presently does not offer the Ritek inkjet printable discs. I have found Ritek printable media elsewhere at comparable prices with free shipping and will buy there until Amazon offers this item. Hint: When buying media or cases always compare prices. Sometimes its cheaper to buy 2 - 50 Packs (Media) or 4-25 Packs (Cases) rather than buying the 100 Packs. If you get bad discs you will find it easier to return. Thanks"
2,Unreliable with Cyberhome recorder,"I've recorded about 120 DVD's on my Cyberhome recorder. In the past, I've used Ritek, Imation and TDK blank disks with no problems. I've now used about 30 of this stack of 100 Memorex DVD's. Two could not be formatted by the Cyberhome recorder and had to be trashed. Two others recorded, seemed okay, but then could not be finalized, which means I can play them on the Cyberhome but never play them on a PC and who knows what else. That's more than a 10% failure rate. Overall, with the price for these being so reasonable, I'm using the Memorex to record things that if I have finalization problems, I won't be too upset, and using other brands for more important recordings - - but I certainly won't buy them again."
1,CRAP CRAP CRAP DVD'S,THESE ARE THE MOST CRAPPIEST DVD'S EVER....THE PRINTABLE MEMOREX DVD'S ARE THE WORST....I JUST TOSSED 80 OUT OF 100 OF MY 100 PACK....THE BACKUPS OF MY MOVIES THAT I'VE USED WITH THESE DVD'S SKIP....I WILL STICK TO THE 8X SPEED DVD'S CRAP CRAP CRAP IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY BOUT THESE DONT BUY THESE...BUY THE 50 PACK MEMOREX AH THANK YOU
1,TRASH,"I have used Memorex without trouble until these printable to the hub ones. The biggest problem is that the burn would be complete and successful but when you go play the memorex, you will quickly find out how much time and money you have just wasted. The disc either does not play or plays partial and stops. I will never never buy memorex again. The money is not the issue, it is the time and effort spent that just burns me up."
1,Do Not Buy - Bad Discs!!,"I, just like a few of the reviewers below, have always had great success with these DVD+Rs. UNTIL they came out with the printable all the way to the hole kind. I then went from 100% success to 100% failure. Unfortunately I was so confident in Memorex, that I stopped testing my discs after each burn long before I received these and ended up losing about 15 discs of data. I have since bought Memorex 8x discs (25pk) and had good success so far, but will never go back to Memorex 4x."
1,Very Disappointing,"The plot had potential, but instead of being enjoyable, this book became quite possibly the worst I've ever purchased. The author's editors really let her down by letting this be published as is--there are lots of mistakes that simple editing would have corrected. Beyond that, the plot limps along offering no surprises, and the romance is not convincing. I will not be buying another by this author."
3,Probably a bootleg,"Fascinating historical document w/ glitches in sound, no mention of Marley family approval.Consensus of posters to rec.music.reggae -- bootlegThe band plays the real reggae on this one, not speeded up semi-rock often played to US audiences"
3,Another David Eddings Book,"You know, after reading these series of David Eddings, i have to ask myself....What was the reason for all this anyway? If youw ant great Sci Fi read David Gerrold's War on the Chorter series"
2,Just OK,"The book offers a few good suggestions, however it's mostly formula. Not for the Independant film writer. The book is a good shoehorn for writers hoping to write Hollywood Summer Tentpole films."
3,Good for beginners,"If you're new to screenwriting this book is essential. if you have experience and are looking for an edge it may not be anything you don't already know, more a gentle reminder of all the things you should be thinking about to write a commercial ""Hollywood"" screenplay."
5,A fresh perspective.,"Snyder classifies genres in a unique, but helpful way to better understand storytelling for the screen. Syd Field's ""Screenplay"" and Robert McKee's ""Story"" and ""Save The Cat"" are the 3 most important books on screenwriting."
5,An awesome find!,"This book has been a huge help to me for learning how to organize a script and working a classic storyline for success. It is extremely easy reading and easy to understand which is important to incorporate the lessons into your work. The system that Blake uses really does apply itself to a classic movie scheme. Also the advice on character development was excellent. After reading this I realized how much more I can bring out in a character through motives alone. The advice on log lines makes a lot of sense also, if you can develop your movie around a good log line it can tie up a lot of loose ends! I am so happy I found this book!"
1,"Lazy, shallow and uncool","I read all the reviews and still thought with so many good ones the book should have something good. But no.He goes on and on about a lot of things that he thinks are right, without giving any explanation, expecting the reader to believe on it for the sake of it or because he tries using a lot of cool (or retarded in my opinion) terms for script genres / problems / tricks.Really amateur, not a deep insight into anything. u can sit down and read it at a library in 2 hours."
5,A fantastic book!,"Not only is this book an enjoyable read, it is also incredibly informative and helpful to screenwriters of all types. Mr. Snyder has had great success in Hollywood and has chosen to pass on what he has learned to the rest of us. The techniques described in Save the Cat! will make any writer see what works and what doesn't in his/her story and (hopefully) get them that much closer to a sale. This book is a must-have on your shelf."
5,Best book on screenwriting yet,"This is the best all-encompassing book about screenwriting that I have read (and I have read many). While Synder doesn't include as much academic structure information that books like Robert McKee's Story do, it offers extremely useful advice and exercises to get ideas flowing. Reading the book has inspired me to get to work on my next screenplay. If Snyder taught a screenwriting class in New York (or online) I'd sign up in a minute."
1,I was shipped the wrong book,I received a book about children and education instead of the Save the Cat book I had ordered. It was disappoint not to receive this book.
5,Cuts through the [...],"Like a lot of would-be screenwriters, I've bought thebooks and attended the seminars. There's plenty of usefulinformation available but there's also a lot of self-important garbage. The bottom line for someone who wants towrite screenplays is: how do I put it together and SELLit? Art is fine but paying the mortgage and establishing apresence in the business is far better. Blake Snyder hasdone all of us a great favor by breaking down the elementsin a successful screenplay so they make sense. Of just asmuch value is his emphasis on what must happen beforeFADE IN is typed. That ALONE makes the book well worthwhilebut the whole package is well-presented and reallyhelped jump-start my current project. Highly recommended."
4,A classic - for good reason,Simply a very straight forward examination of what popular cinema has in common and an encouragement to approach your writing from that perspective.
2,The calories that kill us,"What I like about Glassner's book:It's nice to see something countering the over-the-top hand wringing about obesity/frankenfood/trans fats. (Aren't we living longer and more halthfully than ever before in human history?) There's an awful lot of hysteria about food that doesn't seem to make sense. A food police apologist holds forth on how high fructose corn syrup is ""lethal."" Fat, sugar, aspartame KILL! Hyperbole much? High fructose corn syrup might not be great for us, but it's not lethal. Moderation is probably better than beating yourself for eating a slice of cake. Or -- gasp! -- eating half a cake over the course of one week.What's not to like?The book tries to cover too much ground. While I enjoyed the chapters about ethnic ""authenticity,"" I think they deflated his central argument about food, which is that you AREN'T what you eat. You're a creature who must eat -- and you're a creature who will eventually die. Food is not medicine."
2,Don't Celebrate Yet...,"""And how reliable are estimates of heart disease and eating habits in China? Obtaining dependable information is difficult enough in our own nation of 288 million inhabitants, never mind in a country with more than four times as many people, many of whom live in rural areas with lower rates of literacy"" (Glassner 18).Well, Mr. Barry Glassner obviously didn't read The China Study, by T. Colin Campbell. In The Gopsel of Food, Glassner attacks many other studies on health, but for some reason he didn't attack Campbell's work.""Ask general questions about whether diet matters, he advised, and you'll get platitudes in return. Force them instead to give a number - ask the percentage that diet contributes to particular diseases - and they'll sing a different tune"" (Glassner 25).Perhaps he didn't talk to Mr. Campbell because he would have recieved his precious percentage, and Mr. Campbell's tune would not have changed."
3,"I enjoyed it, Stephen Dorff is HOT!!","The film was good, it wasn't great though. As a die hard Beatles fan, I expected more. There is another film that does a better job. For the life of me, I can't figure out the name of that film, but it showed a better pre-Beatles life. If you know the name of that film PLEASE EMAIL ME. Dick Clark produced it, and the entire film is with a bunch of unknowns!!"
5,Superb,"""Backbeat"" is an excellent portrayal of the Hamburg phase of the early Beatles, and succeeds on every level. Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of ""fifth Beatle"" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the early Beatles. It is as much the story of Stu and John as the story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships. Still, it is a fascinating look at the early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years. The cast is excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed. The music is also excellent, and complements the story perfectly. In all, ""Backbeat"" is an entertaining journey through the world of the early Beatles, and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings."
2,Disappointed in order,"I did not receive the item I ordered, according to the picture. I received a plastic tube of the skin lotion, which is supposed to smell like flowers (hence Fleur) and instead smells like plastic (from the off-gassing). Very expensive for a very disappointing item. I wanted the stand up bottle (pictured), instead got a tube that stinks! Doesn't bode well for my face, which contains my very sensitive nose."
5,Great DVD on history of typefaces- especially Helvetica,"Saw some clips form this on YouTube and decided to buy it - if you are into graphic design and marketing, this is fascinating. The authors do a very good job with the documentary style. In addition to the main program (about 90 minutes), there are supplemental outtakes with the designers who were interviewed (bonus material.) Add this DVD to your collection of you want a sold reference on how type design affects us every day - in everything we see."
4,Very interesting!,"This was a very interesting documentary. Anyone who uses computers (virtually everyone anymore) can learn something worthwhile from this, even those not trained in the field of graphic arts or typography."
4,Swiss...,"Helvetica with a slight different spelling means Swiss. If you enjoy art, you will enjoy this documentary. This is one of the documentaries that the music is extremely well done and a joy to watch and learn certain facts in regard to font designs. Bravo."
1,Helvetica. Or is it just dullness repeated over and again.,"This was difficult to sit through.For me, I would have rather had a dental appointment than watch this dull drivel."
3,"An OK book, helpful exercises.","This book is designed as a course, with exercises to do in each chapter. However, I wish I had read some of the other writer's books I have before buying this one. This makes a good second or third book once you have something that deals more directly with the dynamics of plot and it's relationship to character and setting. Especially lacking is an discussion of how audiences react to the emotional dynamics of each scene and act. McKee's ""Story"" is a great place to start. But Hall's book is a good place for the relative beginner who has some experience and wants to prime the pumps with a few exercises."
1,"Works for a PC, not on a Mac","A new writer recently got a Sony Cybershot and brought in his Memory Stick and disk adapter for us to download his pictures onto our Macintosh systems. Here's what we found out:1: It does not work with external USB floppy drives (took forever to come up- and then it showed a blank 32K disk.2: Switched to an older 61xx PowerPC Mac - the floppy drive showed up faster, but showed a blank 41K disk.3: tried using the utility CD that came with it - It had a conflict with the PC Exchange/File Exchange extension. We turned THAT off and restarted- and the utility promptly started up and froze the machine.4: tried using the gadget on a Mavica FD 87 Sony Camera - it didn't work. that answered my long-standing question on that matter...."
4,"A good album, but get ""Christmas Classics""","This is a good set of 12 songs by Bing, done in his unforgettable style. They're all well done too. However, save your money and instead buy Bing'sChristmas Classics, which has these 12 plus 4 others, including his famous ""White Christmas""."
5,Teaches a variety of Western dance steps...,"Excellent video, taught by a professional country dance instructor. You will learn Two Step, Tulsa Time, Electric Slide, Slapp'n Leather, Ten Step, & Cowboy Hustle.Country Western Dancing has been around for decades, but recently with the injection of new enthusiastic country artists, country dancing is spreading like wild fire. This video captures that enthusiasm, and teaches you to dance like a pro."
1,Save your money.,"This is very expensive for what you get. It does not lock into place in any way, and just sort of floats around in the door. Now, less than 6 months later it has started popping apart daily, and is a royal pain to get back together inside the dog door. We plan to remove it and fabricate our own out of something other than plastic snap together pieces."
3,Repalcement Dog Door,Love the dog door. The wall kit is hard to understand and was even harder to install. I had to get more bolts. Hope to never have to replace.
1,poor quality,"This product will fall apart and is not worth the price, however, you must have the long screws to fit the dog door through a wall of a house. You cannot find screws that long in that size anywhere, so you are stuck paying for a wall kit where you can only use the screws. Build your own wall kit."
2,"Good Idea, bad Follow-through.","This cable is a great idea, but there is no games to use it on. And it cannot be used as a 2nd controller to view your play-book(Madden 2002) or various things like that, many people were hoping for these things and I with others were disapointed with this product. Only buy it if you care obssed with raising Choas."
4,GBA link cable,"I have not purchased this item yet, but i know what it does. it can connect your GBA to your GC. it unlocks new features in SOME games. like in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, your GBA using bud can control Tingle and bomb walls and explore. it's a kool thing to get."
1,Link,I bought this link at Toys R Us last night. You are only able to use it on the Sonic Games. There are no directions for use and had to call Nintendo twice for help. I would wait till more games are released before buying it. Instructions are little to nonexsistant. You have to be in the Garden on both games in order to transport Chao. Not worth the money.
1,very disappointed,"we have 11 games for gameboy advance and none of them work with the cube cable, we are very disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this product. I thought it would allow me to play Gameboy games on the TV. It does not. It is only used for special games, which I have not seen any. So right now it is useless! ..."
4,Does not replace Gameboy player GC attachment,I bought this thinking it would let me play GBA games through the Cube. WRONG! I do have both metroids though haven't beaten Prime to unlock the original Metroid yet but I have a little more motivation now! Just so you know this does not replace the Gameboy player GC attachment.
1,Did Not work and Made me Depressed,This was a complete waste of money. This actually made me really depressed and suicidal. Just work out and eat right. I promise that will so much good to your body rather this drug.
2,Buy it for the looks...,"The only thing that this phone has going for it is the looks...it is VERY stylish and i get complimented on it every time i use it.I bought this phone directly from sprint and it has been a complete nightmare!First of all the phone is rediulously slow as far as when i dial numbers i am on the fourth or fifth one before they come across the screen. Also, when i press any button the response is maybe three or four seconds and i am talking 1-one thousand 2- one thousand...Second, i was playing a game on the phone and the circular plastic piece in the enter of the navigational keypad came off on my thumb as if it was glued on with elmer's...and i am not rough with phones. i don't know if it was the sprint version or motorola, but i am ready to throw this phone against the wall, but since i am so vain i give it 2 stars just for the looks. but i am getting rid of it because looks ain't everything."
3,GOOD CD BUT HE SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE!,"The material is fine. The guy has what it takes to make it in the music business...looks. THe voice? His voice is great! Here's the problem....he sounds like Brad Paisley. He sounds like Alan Jackson. He sounds like George Strait. He sounds like Garth Brooks. He sounds like Tim McGraw. If I heard him on the radio I wouldn't know who was doing the singing. Alas, this is the problem with country music today. We're going too much on looks and not enough on distinctive style and personality. Larsen has the talent and the looks but the talent is a copycat style of everyone else out there. He doesn't stand out, unfortunately because he sounds like everyone else."
5,love it!,I saw this on line read about it bought it and man what a treat .I have not been into the kinmans before and I THINK MOST WESTERN MUSIC FANS WILL FIND THIS RIGHT UP THEIR ALLEY!
4,Adorable Border,"Based on other reviews, I was a little skeptical ordering this wall border because it sounded like it wouldn't look good with the Arcadia bedding set. I fell in love with it. The colors are complimentary. The colors are a little bit bolder than the bedding (which is the only reason I gave it a 4 rating), but who cares. I personally think it compliments the bedding and adds color dimension to the room. Now we just need to add our little bundle of joy (due this May) to the room and it will be complete."
4,cute toy,I purchased this for my 9 y/o daughter who loves it. The instructions are easy to follow and she likes the fact that it is interactive.
3,A cutesy summer read...,"Layla Mitchner dreams of becoming a chef and of true love. Instead, she works as a lowly salad tosser under the watch of a seemingly misogynistic boss. Under increased pressure from her semi-famous actress mother and her friends, she finally quits. Best bud Billy tries to hook her up with Dick Davenport, but Layla thinks he might be a little too uptight for her. (He wears shoes with tassels for goodness sakes!) She then meets a broody mysterious musician named Frank, but everything isn't always what it seems with him. Layla continues to try and get back on track with her career, while constantly finding herself running into Mr. Davenport, whom she seems to be unable to get out of her head. While some parts are a tad predictable, I really enjoyed Layla's cast of friends, which besides flamboyant Billy, include Austrian cook Gustav and bartender Dina."
2,Don't like it,"This thing was recommended to be used for transferring files from the camera instead of using the USB cable when I had lost the latter. It turned out to be a bit unstable and have destroyed some precious picture files while transferring to my XP computer. I recommend sticking with the cable direcly connected to the camera instead, and if you loose the cable, try buying it from cables-to-go."
5,Just right,I needed these to hold papers and CD's that the Dr's request for my parents at their appointments and these work great!
2,"Ok book, but not the best","This book was ok. Part of the problem was that the author tried too hard to make this book comparable with a WW2 book. This book was more about his own emotional experience with the Korean War and less with the actual unit experience. It glosses over the major battles of korea and focuses more on his latter day experiences with the korea war. For a more action packed novel, i would would reccomend another book."
5,Great Product - Great Price,Thanks for making this product available at a great price - delivered on time with no apparent problems upon initial installation and use. This Western Digital HD performs well as expected with no surprises.
2,Can't recommend Baby Bee Smart,While the content of the tape(s) was good the audio is so garbled that it is hard for adults to understand let alone a toddler. The video and audio both seem to be of poor quality.
4,Great for toddlers,"My 21 month old I believe is speech delayed I haven't gotten him evaluated. When I heard about baby bumble bee I had to try it, I thought it would keep his interest but he loves it, he repeats all the words, I would highly recommend these videos to anyone, if your child his older try part 3 or 4.."
2,"Why not call it ""Flash card presentation"" instead???","Though my son and I have watched the DVD only twice so far, I have to say I am deeply disappointed. I thought I was the only bored to death but I noticed my 15 month old son had little interest, too. Sure, there were a few pictures he liked and he took a glimps of the DVD presentation every now and then but for the most part, it didn't hold his attention long enough. I waisted $26 on something I thought could be educational and inspiring to my son who's considered speech delayed.What's worst, this DVD is nothing more but a flash card presentation! Why not name it that way???I will continue to watch this DVD w/my son but if after a week or two he's still not interested, I have to throw it away!"
5,Develops Expressive Language and More,"I have an autistic son who...did not talk a lot. We were growing tired of the same Teletubbies video he watched over and over and tried the first in this series. He was captivated. I can guarantee you that this amazing, wonderful series of videos is responsible for helping my son to learn several words. It has been 9 months since we first discovered the Bee Smart Baby series and my 2 year old can name each and every object featured on all 5 videos. I cannot recommend these videos highly enough, especially for children with communication differences."
3,psychology book--sensation and perception,"if you like sensation and perception then this book is easy to understand, otherwise this book is just a typical textbook."
5,Good way to start.,Best way to start your seeds and cuttings in my opinion. Never had a problem using these cubes. They transplant well into all types of growing media.
3,New to Rockwool,"I just recently purchased these rockwools for an herbal garden i have. I dont really have time to constantly observe my gardens like some ppl. Im a young hardworking man, new to marriage, new to my career, and new to rockwool. I have grown in soil alot before and would recommend it to anyone over rockwool who has limited time with their garden. These rockwools are great with Cloning if ur into that, but as for seed i dont like. The rockwool under light dries real quick, even with water in the bottom tray it does not soke up to the top of rockwool for seedlings. I will go to work and come back to a dried top rockwool, soaked bottom, and a dead dry seed. Its not for me and my seedlings!"
5,When is it coming to DVD,"This is based on a British stage play and has been adapted to an American setting. The critics hated this flick but I thought it was great. It's not for everyone but I found it to be good character study with humor, sex, and all the other elements of the fun sleaze that make Ken Russell film so much raunchy fun. I like the character of Rasta and I haven't liked Ms. Russell in another movie before or since. Porn star Ginger Lynn Allen does a cameo as does cult actor Jack Nance. Go see ""Whore"" even if you can't say it."
1,Pardon me while I puke on you.,"A flat, uninspired, meat parade of a movie. Probably the only movie ever made with a cast of unknowns. Didn't Theresa retire after seeing the dailies? This movie's so bad, Burt Reynolds collects royalties."
2,Atlas of Foreshortening,This might have been more helpful just by improving the quality of the photos. Many poses are basically identical and the light and shadow is dim.
4,The Egg and I is a terrific read,"Betty MacDonald's account of chicken-farming in the Pacific Northwest is an excellent book, good for a laugh. It's filled with wonderful characters like the Kettle family and Maxwell Jefferson the Moonshiner, and it's got a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, and a lot of wonderful scenery in it. If you read it, you'll want to read Mrs. MacDonald's other books: Onions In The Stew and (yes, even) The Plague and I. Mrs. MacDonald writes about real life, with all its tribulations, with humour and insight. The Egg and I is a good investment of your time and money"
4,Awesome!,"My son received this item for Christmas. We finally received our ants and the ants began tunnelling that night. This is so awesome! It's so interesting to watch them tunnel. We've really enjoyed this product. The only problem I have w/this product is when removing the lid off the product, the lip around the lid is squishing up :/ and making it hard to keep the lid sealed properly so that's why I only gave it four stars. I just hope the ants stay in the farm and don't figure a way out :/."
1,POOR customer service,"I will never purchase another Uncle Milton product. Poor customer service! Continually put you on hold, cant answer your questions, tell you to email question and then never respond to email."
4,INCREDIBLE!,"Can't give it 5 stars because the light unit stopped working after a couple weeks, but that's a minor price to pay for the incredible experience my kids and I had with this ant farm. We happened across a nest of ""big headed ants"" and carefully gathered about 20 ants, although next time we will only gather about half as many. Unlike other reviews that stated their ants never dug or it took a week or more, our girls started tunneling by the end of the day and had serious passages in just a couple of days! Sadly they only lived a few weeks so I suppose that particular type of any doesn't have a very long life span, but I would rather have fast digging that keeps my kids interested as opposed to a longer life span. I'm going to attempt to dig the gel out and buy replacement gel to do it all over again because this was absolutely fascinating."
3,Cool Ant Farm,I bought this ant farm to take to workIt was so much fun for everyone!!My coworkers and I all enjoyed watching itThe ants only live about 3 monthsWe wondered if they were getting enough air...I would recommend it!
2,Well half the ants were dead.,"So it does not come with ants, I knew that. But then you have to pay for them (and shipping too) When you buy the ants you even have to tell them, after you get the receipt email, when you want them to ship the ants. All in all, not the best system for getting you a complete product. Almost designed so you won't order the ants.Oh and half of them were DOA. Not the funniest moment of a 4 year's birthday gift set up."
1,The ants died,"The ants died in the first day. These were active ants who not only died, but there was no trace left behind? The lid was tight a nd in place an we are still bewildered."
4,Husband and Son both loved it,"This is a great little ant farm. I loved it because the lid sealed on tight - so even if it dropped it didn't open. Also, you don't have to open the lid at all to feed the ants. Although, my husband would have preferred to be able to feed them. It's very easy to see the ants and fun to watch them build their tunnels. Although, after a few weeks they built all that they wanted too and seem to be rather bored in there. So, it became rather dull. But, it was fun to watch them build while they did. The ants lived about 2-3 months."
3,"Product cool, but not company","This was ordered for my middle school class. The light on the bottom worked once then never again. I contacted the company and never had any response. As for the ants, they were delivered promptly as we paid the higher price and out of 30 ant sent, 18 were dead on arrival. Again I contacted the company and never recieved a response. The ants that were alive did tunnel, which was fascinating, but just know that you get what you recieve and that is the last you will hear from the company. And this is the last they will hear from me or anyone else in my school as we have black listed them here."
1,Service replacement parts,"I found a link on Amazon to Spinkeeper and order directly from their site.Received my cabinet damaged was told I had to email them first. I did, and called several time and still after 30+ day I still can't put mine together because they are waiting for the manufacture to send them a tracking number to send me a tracking number. So here it sits in my living room waiting for parts I will probably never receive. So I have a $500.00 pile of wood and glass. Very poor customer service. I will never order from them again. Be careful."
1,Awful--Don't waste your money,"I bought this based upon the description thinking that it would be perhaps a more ""hip"" way to learn vocabulary words since my kids were listening to other audio SAT vocabulary CD's. When it arrived and we played it you could barely understand the words. We kept looking at the CD thinking did they ship me the right product? It just sounds like bad rap music and it has ZERO value in teaching someone new vocabulary words. The concept in the product description was not found in the actual product!"
3,Super Reader,"A fairly tame sort of adventure, in most respects. A woman is recruited to work for B.L.I.S.S. to stop a doctor that has invented the ultimate Rohypnol type slavery drug.It turns out she knew him in the past, and she ends up on a jungle adventure, while dancing around doing the tangential tent thrusting tango with a veteran agent."
3,Mixed emotions,"I have worn these Moccasins for years. I love them so much that I buy a back-up pair incase something happens to the pair I am wearing. The problem with the last time I did this is that, by the time I needed the new pair, the return time ran out. This pair is cut so narrow that they rub blisters. I have never had this happen before. I am now stuck with a pair I cannot wear. I read that they are now made outside of this country and that is probably what created the problem. There is nothing better than American made the way it used to be. Now, not so much. If you purchase them as back-up, try them on while you can still send them back if they don't fit. I knew better and could kick myself for not trying them on. When they consistantly fit, it is an expensive mistake when they don't."
2,I Didn't Know Atheists Could Lie So Beautifully,"Take a giant in the world of Christian Theolgy and turn him into a self-centered secularist and you have this filmWhen asked if the Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was a Christian metaphor, Lewis denies it and says it is a tale about magic....Of course since atheists believe there is no Ultimate Truth, they have no trouble lying.Of course I was not suprised to see Attenbough was in involved.He ruined Chorus Line by taking the song What We Did For Love, which on stage explained why dancers go through so much at such a risk and made it a sappy love songg..In Young Winston, he made Churchill sound like a pacifist...To get a real picture of C.S. Lewis watch the BBC classic production starring Josh Ackland and Claire Bloom."
3,Not a Documentary but a Commentary,"This movie fails to be the documentary based on ""true story"" but a commentary by the director and actors which fails to provide the essential Lewis story.What is left out primarily is his faith life, which was vital to him, and he wrote about till the end. It is analogous to making film about Tiger Woods with golf as not being featured as central theme. It was not shaken nor destroyed as this movie makes out. The BBC film which proceeded this, thus is far more accurate than this. Hopkins' interpreation of Lewis as isolated in tower and afraid to take on debate is also inaccurate. His relationship with Joy is also inaccurate in many ways.Three stars for with all this Hollywood inaccuracy, many are motivated to seek out real Lewis is his writings and thus discover this fine, intelligent Christian."
5,great movie,"I wanted this in a DVD, but still enjoyed it in a tape which was the thing I could find. Great movie for those of us who still have DVD players :)"
5,My favorite film,"Although not the most artisticly or historically important, Shadowlands is magnificant both visually and emotionaly. Hopkins and Winger are amazing and draw the viewer in from the onset. I've seen this film dozens of time and I cry every time, and I'm not one to cry at movies."
3,Missed opportunity,"I think this is Anthony Hopkins' best performance. He's wonderfully moving, but unfortunately the script is gutted to the point where it misses the essence of Lewis. This ""rigid"" philosopher was really nothing of the sort - read his brilliant 40s sermons (imo, ""The Weight of Glory"" is one of the best ever given). In the end, he questioned, but the ambiguity implied by the script simply wasn't there, as anyone who read his ""post-Joy"" works can see. The depth of Lewis's Christian sensibilities and his struggle with Joy's loss is better captured in the 1980s BBC version of Shadowlands; it was unfortunate to waste a fine Hopkins performance.For more on Lewis, see Kreeft's fabulous ""The Shadow-Lands of C.S. Lewis : The Man Behind the Movie."""
3,More Merry Christmas from Lou Rawls,"~ There are many Lou Rawls Christmas CDs available. Most are simple repackaging of the 1967 ""Merry Christmas, Ho! HO! Ho!"" and the 1993 ""Christmas Is the Time."" This CD gives you a small sample of both of those earlier records. If you are interested in buying a relatively comprehensive Lou Rawls Christmas CD, check out the 2006 ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" which combines all 11 tunes from ""Merry Christmas Ho! Ho!"" Ho!, seven of the fifteen selections from 1993's ""Christmas Is the Time"", and two songs from his final recording session. See my review of theMerry Christmas BabyCD for more details.~ The only reason for giving the great music on this CD three stars instead of five is because the same material is available in better sound with more music on the 2006 CD."
1,Will not keep your child safe,This gate is extra wide to secure large areas like a dining room. The mounts for this gate do not hold the weight of this gate or an 8 month old baby. My son has pushed on the gate and the mount was ripped from the wall leaving an unsafe gap for him to crawl through. I'm my opinion this gate was poorly designed and could really injure a child. I would not recommend this product.
2,Incorrect Product Specs and Difficult to Use,"The Product Description from the Manufacturer is incorrect. The gate DOES NOT span 28"" to 103"" (the product description under the Manufacturer description IS correct stating that the gate spans from 60"" to 103""). Unfortunately the gap we were trying to span is 58"" (but we did improvise a solution).The wall hooks do seem a bit flimsy but the height is high enough to keep our 17 month old from trying to climb over it but low enough that I, at 5'2"", can step over it. It seems a rather imperfect solution for an awkward opening between our hallway and kitchen, but at least it's not incredibly expensive and it does work. If you have a wide opening and a bit of extra money I'd go with another option, but this gate isn't terrible for the price."
1,Flimsy,"Eyehooks were ripped from the wall on day 1. This gate is useless. It offers no resistance against a 12lb puppy, let alone a child."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"All I can say is - DO NOT BUY! This gate is NOT secure and can break in ways that can be dangerous. My 2 year old can work the latch. I bought it to keep my two German Shepherds in the back room of our house, because it is advertised for big dogs. Within 24 hours the hardware on the bottom was bent so badly it did not function, from my dogs merely putting their paws on the top of the gate and pushing on it with their noses to try to move it. We straightened it back out so we could use it again. We didn't use it for almost a month, then put it back up. My SIL's 35 lb collie mix managed to snap one of the upright dowels in half with his teeth and pulled it out of the gate. My smaller dog got himself stuck at the hips trying to follow the smaller dog through the gate, and the other one got her head stuck in it. I'm returning it to PetCo. I paid $70 for this gate and it's not worth $20."
5,perfect,"For the money, it's what I expected. Very light-weight, but does the job well. The spring on the hinge is tight, but I don't mind that. It swings open or the slats slide to the side to open. It sits on the floor...so if you have a toddler and are afraid of their standing on it and it being pulled out of the wall, it's not a concern. The danger is in them leaning on it with too much weight...it could collapse on baby if not supervised. The hinges are simply screws with hooks, so they have to be put into a stud or metal to stay-put. Love the affordability and ease of sliding the slats over to one side."
4,great length,it is long enough for the space that I wanted to cover but is fragile. I had to set a couch close to it for support.
3,Good Gate,"Easy to install, easy to move when not needed. Tho it is not sturdy enough to stop a determined child or dog from blasting though, it keeps a firm enough boundary to keep them honest."
2,Not sturdy,"This gate cannot be relied upon to keep a child confined to a room. It is not very sturdy, and since it has movable parts in the middle of the gate, my 1 year old thinks it's really fun to play with. If it is manipulated at all the screws start to loosen and will eventually just fall out."
2,not very sturdy,Bought this for our door between our living room and kitchen to keep our 1yr old from gettingin there.......it was a great gate for a month Or so but after being used regularly its all wobbly
1,Description of width wrong!,"The product description on Amazon says that this gate fits openings 28"" to 103"" in width, but when it arrived we found that the minimum width is 60"". Our opening is 49"", so this gate is useless to us. I contacted the manufacturer to tell them about the issue and ask if they had any advice and have been waiting 3+ days for a reply. I'm returning the gate and never purchasing from this company again."
2,"Pissed, cheap cost down containers","Don't bother buying this product. The price is nice as a solution to buying breakfast everyday at work, but the cheap containers that kelloggs is using now suck. 5 out of the 60 boxes I received were damaged and food was all over the box it was shipped it. The price was worth it with the discounts kelloggs offers sometimes but losing 8% of the amount paid for ruins the value."
4,A startling drama/tragedy that tells a tale to alarm you.,"Sister My Sister catapults a shocking true tale of sisterly love that goes too far. If you are into dramatic tragedies, like Heavenly Creatures, then Sister My Sister is another unique movie that you should watch."
2,disgusting and over the top,"If you are weak of stomach and religous stay away!!! Has to be a film that will gain a following in the years to come. I myself thought it was disgusting. I was left agape and shocked. The story follows two sisters who grow into an obession with eachother that leads to horrifying conclusions. This film tells the truth in what love between siblings should be put a stop to when it started. In what I cosider...I have no words. The ending which is shocking, but I must admit had to be left to show was a, well satisfactory climax. But still shocking. I would recommend it only to the strong of heart and shock. This film as I said will be a cult favorite."
5,A Christmas Hit!,"Purchased for my grandson for Christmas. He is 3 yrs old., and loves it! The Jeep is a mini version of the real thing! Worth the money to see his smile when he's driving around."
1,I Fell Asleep While Listening,"I'm sorry. I may be the only person this CD set put to sleep, but it did. The interview style of the CD's were very boring to me, not to mention in my opinion a bit arrogant in tone. Normally I am a fan of Mr. Palmers works but this set was a waste of time for me. I did give it a second try though, instead of actually listening to it with attention, I played it in the background and found myself leaving the room totally ignoring the CD. I never made it past the first CD. I cannot recommend the set."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have read the Courage to Teach and loved that book. A bit dry and sometimes, pedantic, it was still a solid book and I was excited to be listening to this series. Until I began.It is in an interview style with someone from Soundstrue. I struggled to listen to the entire thing. His work is lovely but his speaking style is not quite what I expected.I can't honestly recommend this CD set. I would encourage readers to check out his books. His discussion about how to find that place of balance is reflected in his writing and is valuable. It is simply hard to continue to listen to both the interview style of this set and the speaking style of Parker Palmer."
5,A Keeper,"This book is one of the few I read every year.It is healing and wholesome and refreshing to mysoul. It's a great reminder of how shy are our soulsand how very respectful we should be of our ownand others. My favorite message this year is to becomfortable with the tension and space between""fight and flight"" and the reality and the hope/possibilities/vision. Thank you for adding a quietyet powerful voice/message to the world."
4,A Hidden Wholeness,"I was about to partiicpate in a clearness process with a group of good friends. I found this book extremely helpful in clarifying the process , but also a witness to being in touch with ones soul."
5,grat show,eureka 7 is a grat show to biging to it a moust see for any anime fan and the end will blow you away so dont mis this one
2,Boo at the missing disc,"I got the package sooner than I thought I would which was very nice and there was no damage or anything of the sort. I open up the case and one of the discs was falling out. I open it further and disc 11 was missing, which has the same episodes as volume 11. After doing research I see Eureka Seven Vol. 11 selling for $40+. I don't know what to think of this."
5,Ridiculously fun,"Echoing the reviews here, this game is like nothing else. I was a bit perplexed after playing it a couple of times, but stuck with it and am completely hooked!FYI, the ONLY PS2 games I play are Madden, NBA Live, Gran Turismo and GTA. That's it. I've now added Katamari Damacy...get it, it's different, fun, and reminds you what video games are supposed to be."
4,Great Katamari,"I was randomly introduced to this game and have to admit I was hooked within minutes. This is an extremely addictive game that will keep you entertained for hours. Even when I was stuck and couldn't clear a stage, I never got so frustrated that I gave up, I just kept playing. The only thing that I didn't like about this game was that it ended too soon. I want more! The plot line is hilarious and whatever was lost in translation was gained in goofy-ness. Very enjoyable. I highly reccomend this game if you like to battle with yourself."
5,Oh! I Feel It! I Feel The Cosmos....,"its about a itty bitty green dude trying to put the stars back into the sky after the green dudes father ""the king of all cosmos""gets high and knocks out all the stars or something like that lol.you also follow a little story about this japanese family that look all squarey and stuff.you also make constellations.and when you complete one,the girl in the japanese family,Hiro-something,says,""Oh! I Feel It! I Feel The Cosmos!""lol.Go block people!!!!NAINMES EVIL!"
3,Fun in a wierd way,"Katamari Damacy is weird, everything to its wildly addicting gameplay to its catchy themesong its just bizzare. The gamplay, the story is about the king of all cosmos lost all the stars so he has to send his son to earth to roll up the earth in a katamari. Every small object can be rolled up by your katamari. Once you successfully rolled up a big anough katamari in the time given you may ethier choose if you want it to ba a star of stardust. There is also Vs mode you can play with freinds. The graphics arent going to win any awards and the story is stupid, but you still might be sitting there for hours playing this game. They also used a unique way of moving your katamari and how it is a challenging game but i wont take the obsessed gamer a day to beat. Its addicitive but not in a fun way. I give it 3 starsPositive Side+ Cool gameplay+ Unique Controls+ Perfect SoundtrackNegitive Side- Way to short- Not alot of dept- Crapy Graphics"
2,One Big Trip,"The guys who made this game must have been on an acid trip at the time. All you do is roll over objects, picking them up, and you get bigger. There is no point to this game! Dont read the other reviews! This is a bad game. The only reason it gets two stars is because sometimes it is SOOOO bad, it can be funny."
1,not good enough for a title,don't spend your money on this album. Orrico totally messes up the old chrsitmas classics. It's not something you wanna mess with.
1,So bad it's almost a parody of thriller cliches,"The Bottom Line:A movie that Bruce Willis (who has been involved in more than his share of terrible films) has publicly apologized for, Striking Distance seemingly leaves no stone unturned in its quest to include every conceivable cliche of the genre, from its generic thriller title to its obvious red herring character to its one-note depiction of every character; completely unredeemable, this film should not be watched by anyone.1.5/4"
2,>>........<<,I think theyr'e ok but the seams tore and ripped and then the inside stuffing came OUT!?!??? I think they were very comfortable at first and then they just started ripping. A lot of my friends got them too and theirs all ripped too.
4,I'm not all there and so is the movie!,"This is a great package from Rhino, but why or why have they cut 6 minutes from the original release? This is an outrage. You DO NOT tamper with a masterpiece, but this is what's happened. Have certain scenes been cut to accomodate the American market? I'd love to know the answers."
3,Read the fine print!!!,"I purchased a DVD from Amazon and found out when I got it that it was formatted to only play in Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa. I live in the USA and was still sent the purchase. I was told there was a disclaimer that there was a region code on it. I had to truly hunt to find that information! In my opinion it is not good business to sell with that type of info so hidden."
2,I'm no critic...,"I don't want to seem like a movie critic. But I'm a Who freak... who doesn't like this movie much at all. I could have done with a LOT more Who and a lot less... umm... ""movie"", I guess. It didn't do much for me."
4,Old School Vampire Awesomeness!,"For all of the vampire fans out there, check out this great indie vampire flick. This is a vampire flick far removed from the blasphemous Twilight trend that combines the classic vampire lore with modern creativity. Shadowland is an original story, with great special effects and the cinematography is wonderful. I first saw this at the Saint Louis International Film Festival and loved it!"
3,Overall an entertaining tale,"Being a lifelong fan of the vampire genre, I have seen a lot of variations on the classic tales. Shadowland is one of the better recent vampire movies to hit the DVD shelf. The filmmakers takes some liberties with the ""rules"" of the genre, and that might be a problem for the hardcore vampire enthusiast, but overall it is a good story. It is well told and well crafted. The cast is very talented and certainly a group of people to keep an eye on for future endeavors.Overall this is a well-made, entertaining indie horror film."
4,"a FUN movie...not a ""typical"" vampire flick.","I saw this movie when it opened in St. Louis and I was more than impressed. A childhood friend is the male lead (Jason Contini), which is how I found out about it. I wanted to at the least support him and his project, but I found myself really enjoying the film. The story is cool and gives you an aspect of vampire flicks that you don't get to see nowadays, or at least since vampires apparently started to sparkle in the sun.I overwhelmingly recommend Shadowland to anyone who is into vampire flicks, especially the non-Twilight vampire flicks. It's also has a good classic ""chase"" element to the film as well. I really enjoyed it and have added it to my wish list as well."
5,Great Choice!,"I love this book! Wonderful variety of recipes... And, the breads and muffins use grains instead of an excess of nuts found in many raw recipes. Whether eating raw part or full-time... you'll love the way you feel and look!"
5,Great,I took the reviews of others and I agree - these are a beautiful color. Great price and fast service
5,this is coming to blu-ray this summer!,"just announced by Milestone, Sparrows is coming to blu-ray along with 3 other Mary Pickford films. Also included will be the films Ramona, The Poor Little Rich Girl, and Hoodlum."
5,MIRACLE JUICE!!,"I've been drinking Genesis 100 Mangosteen for about a year now. A bit expensive but so worth it! It has helped me TREMENDOUSLY with my severe arthritis pain, allergies, ear infections, you name it. It is basically a natural anti-inflammatory and also keeps your immune system 'flushed'... as well as so many other benefits. I am a long, long time sufferer of the above illnesses... and discovering this product has been such a blessing! I will continue to drink this ""Miracle Juice"" for the rest of my life. Thank you, Lord, for this product and for aiding me with my healing! Miracles can happen! ;)"
3,Jury is out,"The only reason I gave this product a 3 star is because I bought it in hopes it will help lower my Cholesterol (so I have heard). But I have yet to go in for a blood test to see if it is helping it at all. This Mangosteen looks nasty but really hasn't got much of a taste to it which makes it easy to drink the 2 ozs a day. Now as far as the shipping from Good Health Store, it was very slow. The expected delivery was for 9Jan13 and I didn't receive it until 15Jan13. But on the positive side.... the two bottles I ordered were very well packed & they offered the best price for this product with free shipping. So yes, I would order from them again but I know to give them much more time to deliver then what they say."
4,Solid dance collection,"I know the 20th Century Masters collections get a bad rap but I rather like them. They happen to be moderately priced collections with excellent remastering with a handful of the artist's most popular hits. This collection of Crystal Waters features her biggest hits (""Gypsy Woman"", ""100% Pure Love"") plus lesser known songs (""Just A Freak"" and her remake of ""The Girl From Impanema"" reworked into ""The Boy From Impanema""). It doesn't include two of my favourite Waters tracks, ""Relax"" and ""Say...If You Feel Alright"", but this is still a good collection especially if you like '90s house music."
5,This was the best young adult book about a vampire I've read,"Confessions of a Teenage Vampire: The Turning is an exellent young adult book and graphic novel both. I have searched for a long time for a book about vampires that is as colorful, entertaining, and at some points touching as this one is. This is a book I highly recommend for young adults and adults both."
4,Great mute,"I do a lot of my playing in a big band, so obviously I was in need of a decent bucket mute that I could depend on. Overall, I am happy with my mute. Jo Ral makes some really nice stuff. The only problem I had with this mute (as well as my Jo Ral bubble mute) is they insist on using the cheapest possible glue for their corks. I've had to replace the corks on both of my Jo Ral mutes within the first month. And when I am dropping this much money on professional equipment, I can not help but feel a little cheated. Regardless, my new glue works great and I love the mute."
5,A must read for a computer consultant,"I bought this book in 1998 before I started consulting. Thanks to this book, I avoided the traps of bad contracts from middle agency without having to experience it myself. A few of my colleagues that were 'inspired' by the possibility of having good contract that I had, also managed to negotiate better subsequent contracts."
3,Cute Set - But Not Completely Functional,"I loved this set for our son - my husband was very into sports, so we wanted to do a sport's theme for our son's room.We ended up not being able to use the bumper, because it didn't fasten tight enough, and at 6 months old, he was able to stick his head under the bottom of the bumper and get stuck between the bumper and the crib slats.Also, the sheets did not fit the crib very well. After just a few changes, the corners tore because it was TOO tight fitting. For such an expensive sheet (we had bought extra) we were very unhappy.Again very cute, but very disappointing."
3,"cute, but not that practical","I was really excited to find this set when I was pregnant with my son. It is really cute and can grow with him. However, in hindsight, I don't think that buying a bedding set is really worth it.All you really need is a bumber and a few good quality sheets. This set is very pricey, and you don't really need the diaper stacker, crib skirt, or quilt. You can buy the valance and sheet separately if you want them (but one sheet is $17!). The sheet in this set tore after just a few washings, and then again after I had sewn it. We've had much better luck with some cheaper sheets that had elastic all the way around, not just at the head and foot.Instead of buying the whole set, I would recommend getting:4 mix-and-match crib sheets1 bumpersome All-Star accessories to decorate the room (the valance is cute, and we have the lamp, too)All in all, the set is cute but not worth the money. Go with some mix-and-match pieces instead and get sports-related accents."
4,Very cute movie for the whole family!,"This movie could have been a 5 stars if they would have chosen a better actor for Dave Seville. Honestly, Jason Lee is not horrible, but just not fit for this character in my opinion. On the other hand, David Cross gave a really good performance and those little chipmunks are just too charming!In conclusion, even as an adult, I truthfully enjoyed this movie. It wasn't great, but quite cute and enjoyable."
5,Hours of entertainment for the entire family!,This is the best movie out in years. My family has enjoyed it over and over!
3,Better than you'd expect,Of course Richard Roeper called it awful but it doesn't take a genious to know he was going to hate it. But really the movie isn't as lame as I expected. It's certainly more watchable than the Garfield or Scooby Doo movies. It has more of a head on it's shoulder and it's more clever and entertaining. I mean it's pretty funny that instead of sounding like a chipmunk when he sucks helium out of a balloon Alvin has a deep voice.I don't get it how Roger Ebert could recommend both Garfield movies but only give this **. Sure the end is anti-climatic but other than that it's pretty cute and harmless. Well harmless despite the one scene where Simon eats Theodore's poop making believe it's food so he won't get in trouble from Dave. That was gross and un-needed although yes I did laugh but it's not something needed in a kids movie.
1,Not pleased with how item looked,"This item came to me in new packaging, but the cover of the DVD, was not how it was shown on the sellers account. Instead of it being a full picture of Alvin and the chipmunks, it was a small picture of them in the corner of the DVD cover and the rest was a design. I was giving it as a gift and honestly it didn't look ""real"". It looked like it was not a real copy of the DVD and looked Ike a bootlegged copy. I was embarressed to give it as a gift."
1,Junk! Junk! Junk!,"My little boy age 4 wanted this toy and was allowed to use his birthday money to purchase it. As soon as I got the toy home I realized after opening the box that this was a BIG waste of money. Trying to be positive, I hoped that once the toy was put together that it wouldn't be.......Well getting it put together was the first dissapointment, trying to keep it together a bigger dissapointment. This toy is the BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, it is JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! Do not purchase this toy. The best part is the Gingerbread man."
5,So good to see again,Watch this movie any time you feel sad for a real pick me up--I laughed till I cried!!!!
4,Shirley Valetine,"Quite intertaining. Probably more of a 'Chick-Flik' then not, but I would still recommend it. Quite humorous.Dean475"
5,Simply a Classic,"This is a brilliant film with a great cast and witty script. You will probably have to watch it at least twice to catch all the sharp one line throwaway jokes which scousers are so famous for.And then it's a film that makes you think about what you're doing with your own life. If only we all had the courage of Shirley to say ""sod it"" and go for what we really want. Brilliant entertainment."
2,Doesn't Trust The Viewer,"This could have been a very good movie; the under-appreciated housewife daring to go off to Greece without her husband, having a brief and refreshing fling with a sexy Greek man, and an ultimate reconciliation with her husband. The problem with the wife character is that she tells the viewer everything, every single thing that she is feeling, how she is reacting, posing questions to the audience, etc. So much of what she told the audience could have been brought out with non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and good acting. The viewer is not trusted to be able to tell what is going on with the main character; the viewer is told how to feel, with whom to sympathize, and is actually lectured on middle age angst; really, we are smarter and more perceptive than that. It's like putting a sign on a tree that says ""This is a tree."" This story's approach might work on stage, but, on the screen, it is annoying."
5,Never a disappointment,"Finally a DVD viewable in the USA. This movie is a favorite of mine, warm, funny, with heart. All positive comments about it are true. I don't have much to add, but it deserves the five-star rating, and more."
2,will not buy again,"The DVD plays well but has subtitles that I cannot turn off. It has an option on the menu that says you can turn subtitles off but it doesn't seem to work. I will be returning this DVD. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and it arrived very quickly."
5,Absolutely a must for a Diana fan.,"This book is simply beautiful. It follows the photo shoot of Mario Testino's famous black and white photos of Diana. There is not a whole lot of text, simply beautiful photos. In fact, I wish they had lithographs of photos to purchase. Great book, a must have for the serious Diana fan."
4,Perfect for bed time,"Just like all the golden books, they are the perfect length for bedtime stories, about 5 minutes. Even if you are begged to read another, it's still a good amount of time."
3,lightweight,"Of all the larger guidebooks, this one is not very heavy. You must forgo all color and glossy pages, since this book apparently has been printed on newspaper paper. This a good thing, as the book is very light, which is a major bonus when you are lugging stuff all over Paris. It is an adequate guide. It seems, in general, poorly researched but organized well. The hotel recommendations seem as if they were pulled off the internet and nobody even bothered to check them out in person."
4,Effective to learn TCP/IP programming best practices,"Not all of the 44 tips are exceptional. Some of them are pretty trivial such as ""Read Stevens books"" or ""consult RFCs"" but about 35 tips are very good. The author knows well this topic and explains very well the reasons behind these tips. I am sure that all these good tips can be found in the TCP/IP Illustrated books but if you do not have the time to read 3 volumes consisting of about 2000 pages, this less than 300 pages book will provide a nice synthesis of TCP/IP programming good practices."
3,"Good one, but unsuitable for KINDLE!","A good book in terms of content. But when reading on kindle, the formatting of the text goes for a toss and the information which is meant to give clarity gets even more confusing. I wish the publishers can do something about it or else fill in the customers with customized settings for the most accurate view of the content. Else, it won't be of much use as an e-book."
5,A Great Resourse For Screenwriters of All Levels,"In THE HOLLYWOOD STANDARD, Christopher Riley uses hundreds of clear and concise examples to show us what we are doing right and wrong with regards to screenplay formatting. As a Film Professor, this is an critical tool for students and seasoned writers alike. Riley's attention to detail mirrors the specificity one must have in creating an entertaining piece of literature that is the modern screenplay. I will be using this text in my classes."
5,Best Screenwriting Format Guide,"This is most definitely the best book on screenplay format. If you're looking into writing professionally for film, this is an absolute must-have. If you want your script to make it through Hollywood, don't delay any longer before getting your copy."
1,Don't Buy the Kindle Version,"This review is for the Kindle version only!!! Do not purchase the Kindle version until the publisher has fixed the formatting issues that plague the book. These issues will cause you, if you are unaware, to format your script incorrectly.The paper version of this book may be a wonderful resource, but I cannot verify that. I can verify that I returned the Kindle version because of the above issues. If you do purchase the Kindle version, please be aware that you will need to find formatting examples from another source."
4,"Could be better, could be worse.","There are some inspired moments here, but remember, we're talking about something that was initially sold via a 1800 number. The songs featuring Prince himself are clearly the best, with a few other good moments scattered about. Buyer beware."
3,Ten Years and Still ON HOLD??? There's no wonder why!,"The enigmatic and highly prolific Prince is responsible for this collaborative effort between a myriad of others and himself, resulting in a release that is simultaneously rewarding and disappointing. Most of the ten tracks sound like ""throwaways"" that shouldn't have seen the light of day, let alone a recording studio. Even the great George Clinton couldn't save ""Hollywood,"" a truly horrible ditty about ""Tinsel Town.""The best cuts are the ones with the female vocalists taking the lead. ""Standing at the Altar"" by Margie Cox, Mavis Staples' gospel-tinged ""You Will Be Moved"" and Nona Gaye's reworking of ""A Woman's Gotta Have It"" are worth repeated visits, but the remainder of the album is mediocre.Perhaps, ""The Artist"" should've concentrated on working with those three ladies only. The album would probably have generated some interest, as well as better sales."
1,Cheap China Crap!,My son bought this gun a week ago. We just got it today and my son was shooting it around for about 30 minutes. Then after that he went to soccer practice. After soccer he played with the gun some more. After about 10 minutes the gun started jamming. So he took out the magazine and dumped the BB's out. It started firing again and then the tigger wouldn't shoot. The safety was off and so was the spring pull back thing. So he took the magazine feeder out and then this metal piece fell out. Then he tried to take the barrel out and another different piece fell out. Now we can't get it back together. We tried calling Airsplat and there was just a recording and we couldn't get a hold of them. This gun SUCKS.
3,a 3 out of 5.,"this is a really good gun. the only problem with it is the disability to load the bb's. if you use full auto then you're set. if you use semi auto then you arent. every other bb will fire nicely. you have to shoot one int the chamber then fire the next one immediately to propel the first out of the gun. granted it will come out twice as fast but still it's a hassle. not something you can worry about on a battlefield. if you get this gun you need the hi cap mag with it. you need to be able to fire in bursts. i will hand it to the makers that they made a gun with one hell of a racket. this gun unloads extremely fast. it's like the bb's tailgate eachother. since the design is that of a bullpup, the accuracy is fairly reasonable. carbine sized gun but with sniper like accuracy is the bullpup design. this gun pull it off well. 3 out of 5. kudos to you blue elephant."
3,Ok........,This gun dissapointed me a lot. The only instructions were pictures. There is also no hop up and the gun shoots more of 250fps than 300.
2,AUG Styer airsoft gun,i liked the gun at first. it was definitely worth the money for a while. if you try to take it apart though then you have a problem. i do recommend this product to anyone but you should not try to take it apart OR OVERCHARGE IT... it messes the thing up big time. would also recommend buying AT LEAST two extra clips.
2,AUG Styer,"Pros:- Cheap- Looks Good- Intimidating sound- Pretty heavy (adding realism)Cons:- Semi manual doesn't work (The bullet just fell from the barrel with no power)- Automatic works, but not powerful i shot my roomate within 2 feet and he barely feel anything.- Scope doesn't magnify or has crosshair- Magazine made from bad plastic- Front handle is not firmI don't recommend to buy this gun, unless you want it just for figurine and not going to use it for battle, or outdoor activity. I would recommend you to invest more a little bit more $$ for better gun."
2,pros and cons,pros:it looks very realisticclip holds 57can fix very easilystrong plasticintimidatingvery powerful 9.6v batterythe gun is the price of the batteryvery high rate of firecons:35% of them come in the mail brokenhandle wobbles a bitscope does not magnify
4,Awsome,"This is a very good gun. I was very pleased when I got it. It shoots at about 300 fps. It has a little side spin to the right but otherwise it is very accurate. This gun is actualy only fully automatic, the only reason it says it's semi-automatic is if you pull the trigger back a certian distance is shoots out one at a time but any furthur and it is full-auto. The force grip is kind of wobbly and I can't get it to fold up. Also the safety goes further than ON/OFF, if you push it far enough it would fall out. The speed loader that it comes with is very handy without it it would take a very long time to load. It says it comes with 5000 free BBs but i never got them. So far i have found a few pointless things on the gun. There is a slide on one side of the gun and a cocking mechanism which do absolutly nothing, but with all that said it is a very good gun. (You would realy want to buy another high capacity magazine for the gun to be really effective)"
3,It is unable to play what it claims,"Although this MP3 player claims that it is able to play CD-R/RWs both in audio and MP3 formats, it is not true 100%. I had problems with playin all the MP3 songs on CD-RWs. It sometimes cannot skip to the next directory, but it continues as two directories are one. It could not play an audio cd-r that I created on my PC which was played by other cd players. All mp3s play very good on PCs and other MP3 players.I keep mine since I bought it used for cheap and it pays what it gives to me."
2,ITS NOT FOR AM2 !!!,"Specifications said for am2 too, but it doesnt FIT !!! I'm so angry for that. !!!"
2,Yikes!,"She REALLY loses it here. There is only one catchy song on this release, and that's, ""You Know Who Your Friends Are"" which finds Chrissie is one of her rare, humorous moods. I recommend The Pretenders' 1990's ""Packed!"" in leiu of this one--you won't be as sorry as you will be if you buy this embarrassing mess!"
2,childish,Perhaps I was expecting too much. This book didn't hold my interest at all. It was very childishly written in my opnion. Glad I didn't pay for it.
2,"Love the pattern, BUT HARD TO PUT UP","I got this border as a gift to go with the barnyard bedding we also registered for. While the border is cute, and is a WONDERFUL addition to our nursery, it was very difficult to put up. We followed the directions to a ""t"", but for some reason, the top edge was not sticking. It looked like there was no glue on this part of the border. So, we figured out a trick...wet the border, and put on the wall where you want it. Wait for about 10 minutes and start pushing the glue FROM THE BOTTOM. With glue at the top (glopping out of the top), wait for another 10 minutes or so. THEN push out the rest of the glue. We still needed to work the top edge with a damp cloth for a good while, but it did eventually stick.So, while the border is cute, be ready to spend an entire afternoon putting it up."
1,Save Money,If your interested in saving money JcPenney offers this pattern also. the 3pc. set at babies R Us is $179.99 when at Jc Penney its 129.99. At Babies R Us you have to buy the lamp and shade separately 34.99 for the lamp and 14.99 for the shade. At Jc Penney its 39.99 for the whole lamp. So far I have found that you save about $60 by getting Barnyard from Jcpenney. And the $60 you save would buy you a portable swing if you didn't already have one.
1,No specifications,"I love the design -- but, there is no information. The description does not include the length of the border or whether or not it is pre-pasted. Without further information, I can't purchase the product!"
5,As good as it gets - live or not...,"Mariza is, easily and almost cliched at this point, as good as it gets on the planet... Fado is in her blood and you feel like she's about to open a vein in live performances.There have been negative reviews about the compatability of this CD with some MP3 players - which sadly looks like a poor review for the performance... PLEASE, if you are a Fado fanatic or just a beginner - you need this CD! The DVD is also wonderful!"
4,"Kindle Review: Interesting Tale of the Beginnings of Wheeling, WV, just a free download away...","I have read a number of Zane Grey books over the years, and this book, Betty Zane, ranks up there among his best for me. The setting is early for him, taking place toward the end of the 1700's. The story was reminiscent of James Fenimore Cooper with the earliest settling of an area east of the Mississippi, as well as dealing with the native American tribes of the era.Pros: an easy read. Based on historical facts. Interesting details about the native American tribes.Cons: plot is predictable. Contains some violent, graphic fighting, mostly against the native Americans. And as this work is somewhat genealogically biographical for the author, I found the author's descriptions of his forbears to be a bit over-the-top perfect.Add one star if you are related to Zane Grey or other early settlers of Wheeling, WV. All in all, another great free Kindle read!"
3,borderlife,I was extremely happy with this product. I enjoy reading about real people who are real and who endured the times. Especially the fact that Eb Zane treated the indians with respect. thank you
2,"OK it's a classic, but it bored me to tears","This is one of those books where I can see why people consider it a classic, at the same time that I wish I'd never been forced to read the silly thing. Some classic books are hold your breath reading. This is smother your yawns reading. The grammar and prose are not enough reason to read the tale of a silly woman and her boring husband. Though if Emma were real she'd be a hot candidate for the Darwin award. If Flaubert was so bored by his story and subject, why should I be interested in them?"
1,Boring and amateurish,"This pseudo-documentary looks like a film student's first project. The cinematography is abominable, the content is weak, and in general it's pretty god-awful. Don't bother."
4,Subtle.,"I don't know how many will agree with me, but I consider this CD as one of the best scores for an animated film. While this soundtrack is not up to par with Elfman's Batman scores, it is considerably better than Goldenthal's Batman Forever. What we got here, is the darkly heroic Batman theme of the two movies in a different arrangement, and various tracks varying from sadness, like Birth of Batman, to superb action cues (Phantasm and Joker Fight), and decent romantic ones (First Love). All in all, this is a good soundtrack and worth byuing if you are collecting animation soundtracks. Personally, I don't think that Disney's animated features had better music than this. It is a score that would listen well in a live action film."
5,Awesome!,"Batman: MOTP is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes anything Batman! I must say, that when Joel Schumoucer (or however you spell it!) took over the Batman movies, it was a disaster!!! However, this made a great alternative to stupid (and I put an emphasis on stupid!) Batman and Robin! I mean come on! Tim, why couldn't you have directed the others too? I give this movie 5 stars for great action and a great storyline! I only wish it would come out as a live-action feature!"
4,Maybe this is the Best Batman Movie Ever.,"Batman (Voiced by Kevin Conroy) has to face a new Anti-Villian named the Phantom, who has been Killing Dangerous Gangster for Revenge. Bruce Wayne/Batman cannot forget about his Past Romance (Voiced by Dana Delany), who was Comeback to Gotham City. While he has his Troubles with The Joker (Wonderfully Voiced by Mark Hamill).Directed by Eric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm made a Slick Animated Film. A Box Office Disappointment in Theaters, was Supposed to be a Direct-to-Video Release. This film is Too Strong for Youngster. This is Based Strongly on Frank Miller`s Dark Knight Comics. Extremely Well Made. Grade:A-."
1,Seagal's directing's on deadly ground,"Seagal put together this laughable, nearly comedic hero-action flick to satisfy his ego and preach environmentalism with a ten minute lecture-film at the end. Joan Chen's and Michael Caine's talents are wasted, and the intelligence of Alaskan Native Americans is insulted. Cinematography of beautiful Alaska must be applauded."
3,"Great picture, in a roundabout manner.","Michael Caine and the rest of the stars really make this movie shine; unfortunately Seagal is still an unconvincing actor. Had it not been for the manner in which the movie ends, I'd actually be convinced the movie was written with the environment in mind."
3,Not Too Good,"Okay, so this movie isn't up to the quality of Steven Seagal's earlier movies. It is, however, great, compared to his later films. The whole wilderness thing is like taking a fish out of water, Seagal, before this film was either a cop or a military guy. The storyline is stupid and the characters are just stereotypes. The big bad oil guy; the poor natives being victimized, etc. Then the little speech at the end of the movie on pollution is just ridiculous. I couldn't stand the whole Indian vision sequence either! Technically, the film is made without any grievous errors and the cinematography is nice."
1,Buy this movie to laugh at it only,"We have all seen the ""tough guy"" formula used before ,but never have I seen the image also carried off screen while they filmed here in valdez. Anyone asociated with the film here, either hates it,due to all the inacurate portrayals of Alaskan natives,or it's blatant misrepresentation of big oil as ""the bad guy"". I'm sure cashing in on a oil spill made sense ,but I am glad it didnt pay off. The acting by the lead was horrible ,only Caine and Chen made the movie halfway viewable. It is good for a laugh though."
4,"Importance of Knowing Your ""Audience""","The book was in good shape just as advertised, and I received it in a timely manner.With the demographics changing in America, it's no longer just good enough to understand different cultures in our travels, but right here at home. As we continue to see more immigrants from all over the world coming to our country we must understand their customs and communication style to be effective business people and friends."
4,interesting bit of history,"From back cover:Profound, provocative, amusing, fascinating, Rats Lice and history utterly defies literary classification, except that it is undoubtedly a contemporary classic. Using as his framework a ""biography"" of typhus fever, Dr. Zinsser writes trenchantly on infectious diseases and medical responses, people, customs, history, places, religion, art and science in a pawky style which shows both his enormous scholarship and rare human wisdom."
2,Kindle Review: No Illustrations!!,"I didn't realize how much the clever illustrations normally associated with Aesop's Fables, contributed so much to my enjoyment of these tales. I have a 3rd generation Kindle and, of course, did not expect full color illustrations. I did, however, look forward to black and white drawings.If illustrations aren't a necessary part of enjoying these fables for you, then this is a fine selection."
5,Aesop's Fables,Excellent book for individuals interested in readin Aesop's fables; the book has all the fables. The historical listing and introducton by D L Ashliman is very insightful. A most read book.
3,Fables,Not so crazy about the illusatrations in this book.They could also have elaborated on The Boy Who Cried Wolf.
1,Too boring,"I wish I had taken time to read the reviews in detail, rather than going by the total number of stars. I bought the paper back edition (not sure if other editions are different). It differed from the look inside view, very few illustrations and small print, not something a 5 year old would enjoy. The language used is also a little difficult for a child to comprehend. I also found the narration to be rather abrupt. It seems more suited as a quick reference for a story teller who needs to quickly pick a story and then elaborate it in his/her style."
5,"Betseyville Wild Child Medium Satchel,Natural",Beautiful... I could not find this item ANYWHERE! Thank you for coming through for me once again.
3,Goldilocks and the Three Martians,Goldilocks and the Three Martians is a great twist to the original Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The story is written in a poem like format with rhyming sentences which adds an interesting touch to the story line. The illustrations catch the eye with the bold use of colors. This would be a great book to use in a camparing activity with Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
3,"HTML, XHTML, and XML",The book is full of information but lacks cohesion when you do the homework reviews and cases. There is a big difference in what is shown in the book and what is expected. I find that each chapter is lengthy and full of information and definitions. I would much rather know what the functions are than how each came about. I bet there are better books out there to learn to design web pages.
3,BEWARE of Kindle E-book Version,"I got the Kindle version because it was cheap. I would NOT do it again. The equations are almost impossible to read. I tried making the font larger and less words per line and the numbers and equations remained too small to decipher. This made it hard for me at times to do my homework. There are also some typos that my class and I found which should not be happening when you are being charged so much for college books these days. Substance-wise, the book did help me understand more about statistics (because things are put very simply with plenty of examples and practice problems) and I've actually garnered more respect for the subject."
5,WELL WRITTEN,"This is an excellent book. It is well written, and not cluttered with unnecessary and convoluted mathematical rigor. The statistical presentation is adequately rigorous, and the examples and exercises are very useful. One is able to learn statistics on one's own by going through this book.The only drawback is that the book does not delve more into the rules of probability: addition and multiplicative rules, mutually exclusive, independence, etc.Nontheless, a great book.The Title should be Statistics for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, so that it could be adopted by more programs."
3,Needs TRACTION,"It's beautifully designed and very functional. Good height, and the storage is great. That said, we had to retire this stool to the closet when my 21 month old son slipped going down, falling forward into the corner of a wall, and ended up in the Emergency Room with a giant bump on his forehead. Even a few clear or small non-skid treads on this would go a long way. Same for the bottom, which should be rubberized to prevent slippage."
2,stiff buttons,I bougth this set so if the power went out I could contact my parents. Because of my muscular dystrophy my hands and fingers are to weak to push the buttons. Buttons are very stiff and hard to push.
2,Wireless Intercom,The unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface. 100ft. would be pushing it.
5,Reporter RWIS Wireless Portable 4-Channel Intercom System,"Excellent product. Installed power supplies on 2 units for no delay talking. Kept 2 units as battery for portability. VOX feature does not activate without first manually receiving. For the money it is a great item though. It is a good thing Radio Shack dropped their FRS intercom unit, this unit now has 100% of the FRS intercom market at a fraction of the cost. Outside door intercom unit makes a great add-on!"
1,Couldn't get it to work,The product instructions were poor and/or the product just did not work. I tried for an hour and could not get it going.
3,Worth reading with some caveats for the uninformed reader,"I enjoyed reading this book but was chilled at the author's inclusion of ""1929"" as a year of Palestinian ""pride"" without mention of the atrocities of the Hebron pogroms. ""Text without context is pretext"" as the PLO's old friend Jesse Jackson used to remind us. Tom Segev's One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate (which alot of Amazon reviewers think has an anti-Zionist bias) would be a good corrective for the reader new to these issues.Amiry is not a fanatic or a fundamentalist and this is her P.O.V. and her life. Can she address the moral failures of the Palestinian leadership, beginning with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and ending in Hamas? Maybe, but this is not that book."
1,Boring cliches,"As an Israeli living in the US, I was looking forward for an eye-opener on life in Ramallah.This may have been cute as emails, yet as a book it is one long tedious collection of cliches, full of self-pity, and quite hard to feel any real sorrow beacuase of the ""Party-line"" style.My Jewish family, too, had to flee their home in Arab hostile Morocco. We recently visited and it was quite nostalgic! We do have a life in our new-found countries.So 2 words:As a book, it stinks;Have a life already."
4,Just a little distasteful,"Hard to describe this one. I can't really put my finger on it, but this book is a bit too out there for me.Ms. Holt takes us through a journey with a young lady who has been orphaned. She finds herself being taken from the country she has grown up in and taken to a foreign land. She falls in love with the man that her father worked for but not before she makes him a fortune and not before she falls in love with the same man's son.It doesn't hurt that the family is very rich and she has come from a very poor background."
4,Getting Past Tragedy,This is sort of everything but the kitchen sink on the shock and grief after a plane crash including lawyers and counselors. The main character somehow managed to overcome all fear in his life. A young boy who he rescued now only feels safe around him. The young lady he befriends somehow blames herself for her toddler dying. It doesn't (and really cannot) add up but there are enough independent great moments to make this film worthwhile.
4,Great Movie - Horrible DVD (4:3),"This is a review of this DVD version of the film. I purchased this version because several people mentioned that the movie was filmed in 4:3 (approx) and that the 4:3 DVD contained nearly the full picture while the wide screen theatrical release was chopped on the top/bottom to simulate wide screen.When you view the DVD it says it has been formatted to fit your TV screen.I also purchased the German version from Amazon.de which is wide screen (16:9) and that version clearly shows more of the image. In the opening scene where the three farm workers are kneeling on the ground, you can clearly see that this DVD is a Pan/Scan version of what is shown on the German DVD. The German DVD also has an English audio track but it is PAL so it won't play on North American DVD players but there are ways around that if you have a multimedia device.4 stars for the movie but 1 star for this DVD"
3,Good movie,"It was a good movie. Nothing I would write home about, but it was worth renting. A little too predictable at times."
1,FULL SCREEN RENDERS FILM DEPRESSING,"One of my favorite films of all time, but it is ruined by being in pan and scan. Why the hell they don't release it on widescreen is beyond me. This film was marketed ineptly. It clearly deserved AT LEAST the oscar nom. that Rosie Perez had come oscar time.Great film, just, horrible format."
5,A fine film.,"A fine film. The other reviews give plenty of details about it. I'll just add the suggestion that if you like this movie, you should probably read ""Lost in the Cosmos"" by Walker Percy. If you're already a W. Percy reader, then you'll probably like this film."
3,These sheets are only ok.,"These sheets are only ok. They are soft, but thin. It took only 1 season and holes appeared. I would not buy them again."
4,For use withoug cats,"These sheets are a lovely rich chocolate brown color. They are very soft!! If you're planning to use these as winter bedding, they wouldn't be that warm or thick so don't rely on these as thick fleece sheets. I'm using them for the warm summer months and they're perfect!My only problem is that my cat walking across the bed only a few times managed to snag her claws and easily rip these. I can tell for everyday use they're not going to hold up that long."
4,Super Value,"These sheets wash beautifully and dry quickly. They are ultra-soft and very warm. The deep plum color did not fade in the wash and the fleece did not lint up in the dryer. They fit our queen sized bed very well and are a terrific value, too. I recommend these fleece sheets."
2,"Feels like thin felt, soft but thin enough to see thru","I ordered these sheets for our guest room, having family over for Christmas and it's cold outside. I was expecting ""Fleece"" which is the exact word used to describe these sheets in the seller's description - however, these sheets are more like thin, see thru felt used for art projects. The back side of the top sheet has a nylon back, so it's not even the same material on both sides the top is a felt like material and the back side is stretchy nylon material. Hopefully they will be okay for the 5 days we have guests, but definitely NOT for long time wear."
1,Awful!!,Not really sure how anyone can say these are nice or soft or anything like that. It is cheap and feels more like felt than flannel. Not anything like flannel sheets I have had in the past. I am afraid to wash them as I feel like they will just come apart in the washer. These are going back!
2,I was shocked!,"This is my fault for buying these. I didn't key into the fleece in the title. I opened up the package and was dispointed to find flannel sheets. I've never had flannel sheets so I decided to give them a shot.It is cold right now in Afghanistan and the flannel sheets were very comfortable at first. But I am a light sleeper and these things kept me up all night. For one thing you can't roll around in them without getting tangled up. They have enough friction that they stick to your clothes when ever you shift positions. This drove me to distraction.Additionally, while I was awake trying to get myself untangled, I was constantly getting shocked. I can just imagine what my daughter, with her long blonde hair, would look like in the morning after sleeping in these.The material is thin and looks like it will wear out quickly, but I'm not really giving them the chance. I ordered something different that will hopefully get here in a few weeks."
2,Disappointed,"These sheets are very thin. I was disappointed. I had read they were only fleece on one side but, still, the quality is not impressive. Save your money a little longer and buy a set which is better quality. This was not worth the money I saved."
4,Nice flannel sheets,"These are very nice quality sheets, a little on the light side but I prefer these over heavy flannel sheets. One of the hems was not sewn, i discovered right out of the box, so I had to fix that, but otherwise I am pleased with them."
1,Seriously 100% polyester!,"I'm sorry to say that I was an idiot and ordered these sheets, not realizing that the description did not specify the type of fabric. I should have been more investigative, but no. They are 100% polyester. If you have any hang nails, or snags on your bodily bits, these sheets will stick to you as if you were a porcupine. They feel soft, but slickly horrible. When I'm in bed, I don't want to think about artificial petroleum-based materials. These are going back!"
2,poor quality,"The sheets were poor quality & not at all like I was expecting for fleece. They were very thin, not warm & fuzzy like THe set we already had & purchased elsewhere. Very disappointed & would not have ordered THem Had I known they were like this. Thank you."
2,Just okay,"I know I didn't expect much for the price, but they were just soso. One side of the sheets isn't all that soft."
3,get what you pay for - these fall off our bed in less than a week,"I really love the warmth and feel of these sheets --- I bought two more sets (at round $10 per set) despite the major drawback: they stretch out and come off the corners. The bottom sheet will not stay put after less than a week of use!But, for $10 --- I put up with it, and, as mentioned, I love the feel of these sheets -- they are warm but lightweight. And, they really do hold up pretty good in the wash (so far)...we're on our 5th or 6th washing. Due to the weight, I was nervous these wouldn't hold up after one washing -- but these are our favorite sheets this season (winter!)."
1,Extremely disappointed!,"These sheets were very poor quality, very ""plastic"" to the feel. I washed them on gentle and put them in the dryer on the coolest setting. I checked them in about 15 minutes and they were starting to melt, leaving scratchy crinkled spots here and there. The washer and dryer filters were both full of purple fuzz. I sent them back, as they were useless to me. The only thing I liked about the sheets was the vibrant purple color!"
3,A decent set of sheets for the price.,"I read the other reviews before buying these sheets, so wasn't surprised to find that the sheets are very thin and only fuzzy on one side. When I opened the package I didn't like how fuzzy they were - seemed like they'd leave lint all over everything. They felt much better after a wash, though. They are very soft and warm, and fit on my thick, pillow-top mattress well. If you're looking for a decent pair of inexpensive sheets, these will do you well."
4,Sheets,Sheets are okay... I purchsed them because they were cheap... They're for a guest bed... My houseguest said they were great...
1,horrible. ripped in less than a week!,Was hoping to have some great sheets for the cold winter months. What I got was very cheap fleece that literally ripped one night as I turned over. I am not a violent sleeper!! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Had I been able to rate these no stars I would have.
2,I Thought They Were Cotton,"I searched Amazon for flannel sheets, and I have always thought of flannel being made of cotton, in fact I had never seen flannel made of anything else before, but these sheets are made of 100% polyester. I feel fooled, and would not by them again. They are soft, but the don't breathe very well."
1,LOUSY sheets,"I have no idea what these sheets were made of but it was NOT cotton flannel, which is what I assumed I was ordering. They were some nasty, stretchy6, uncomfortable ""cloth"" that was impossible to sleep on. We tried them once, the dog now has them in her cage to sleep on. I am NOT joking nor exxagerating. These sheets are AWFUL. Poor quality, do not buy.Veronica Gordon"
1,not pleased,"cheap and not fleece but the kind of material that if you had dry skin would snag and give you the heeby jeebies. I paid $25 and they are supposedly $50 sheets??!! That is crazy, they look as if they will fall apart after a couple washings. They are so thin I can see thru them and I haven't even put them on the bed yet."
1,disappointed,I was very disappointed in these sheets. One side felt like felt and I cant even give that much credit to the other side. I have other fleece sheets that are wonderful I was more than disappointed with them.
2,Fleece Sheets,"Very thin, one sided fleece. Fleece was not very plush either. Fleece sheets from Shopko a bit more money but much better quality."
3,just okay,"I would give this product 2.5 stars if possible. They were only $20 and it shows. They are really bright green in color, not the muted dark green they appear. The bottom of the sheets is a strange meshwork on which the top ""fleece"" is built. Not the softest fleece sheets I have ever seen."
2,Damaged,"The package did not appear to have been damaged, but the end cap was cracked and it cannot be used. Unfortunately, the time to return has expired. I don't know if I can find parts. I don't want to have to buy another one."
1,do not buy this item,"I have given this item 1 star because there is nothing lower. It might be a good product, I will never know. The first thing you will find is that in order to view the product you will need to download a software package costing an additional $15. The next thing you will find is that if you want a refund from Amazon, you will pay the shipping because this is not their fault (even though this is not mentioned in the description). The next thing you will find is that if you delete the program on your computer you will lose shared files."
5,Great 2nd Album,This is a really great album. I bought both Rumble Doll and this one as I did'nt know she even had done any CDS.The bonus cd is good too.. Hope she puts out more CDS. Keep up the great music Patti. She can do it on her own with out Bruce and I really like him as I have most of CDS. Try this one and Rumble Doll if you have'nt already. You will not be disappointed.
5,"A Stunning, Beautiful Recording","This album ranks right up there alongside her first album, Rumble Doll, which has become something of a cult classic and is my all-time favorite. Once again, Patti shows that she is an extremely gifted songwriter. There truly is no one better in my book. My favorites are Romeo, Love Stand Up, Chelsea Avenue, and Young in the City, but like Rumble Doll, there is not a dull song in the bunch. This is an album that can be listened to over and over again, from start to finish, without ever growing tired of it. I don't own many albums that I can say that about. Her voice is unique, maybe not beautiful in the conventional sense, but definitely fits extremely well with her songs. She gets bashed by a lot of Bruce fans for her singing, but don't let that deter you. Just give the music a chance and see if it grows on you like it has for so many of us. It may turn out to be a huge, wonderful surprise. Her music is the very definition of art."
1,"Slight work, little content","The book, while well-meaning, reads like a press release from the faires covered in the text. The book is clearly outdated, and unless you collect renfaire memorabilia (which I do) it is honestly not worth 19.95.The pictures are decent, but press release quality also."
3,Difficult to line up,While the screen overlay is a good idea I found it difficult to apply it correctly. I tried several times to line up the one end of the overlay with the top of the screen. When you remove the backing to apply it to the rest of the screen it ended up overlapping the bezel at the other end. I never did manage to get the bubbles out from behind the overlay.It does protect the screen even though it is not straight and has bubbles. The price is a little high for one sheet of stick on plastic and two cleaning pads.
5,Panic in Babylon,"Its may Perrys favorite album, im a psychiatrist or fight to the finish - best dub reggae songs ever!!"
3,good but dated,"This is a good book, but a little dated. there is a version 2.0 out now but was unavailable at the time I bought it. I would recommend to get the newer version since this book does talk about technology that is somewhat old."
3,Don't buy it,"It is outdated. Many parts of this book still applies, but when it talks about products and methodologies, it is lagged at least ten years.Go to patterns and practices web site and check for updated material."
3,Whatever you were expecting....,doesn't prepare you for the musical number halfway through the picture. Jarring is perhaps the best description. Just roll with it and enjoy the denouement.
1,Unwatchably awful video quality,"TERRIBLE picture quality. Quit watching after five minutes. Looks like a copy of a very fuzzy, washed-out VHS or Beta tape. You can even see those sparkly static dots across the bottom of the screen that (back in the 1980s) meant you needed to adjust the tracking control on your VHS. Amazon should not be offering this on either DVD or video-on-demand streaming."
2,So bad its...bad.,"Don't get me wrong; I like trash. But this manages to be both very dull and very over the top at the same time. Constance Towers is ok (its no wonder she ended up doing soaps; she has that ""almost convincing"" way of acting). Anthony Eisley is fair. The movie has some of the absolute worst, terrible, shockingly bad child actors imaginable.The bad acting, fake streets and sets, stereotypical characters and sheer length make this painful. Nothing rings true enough to take it seriously--but how can you laugh at crippled children and child molesters? Its like Roger Corman without the fun.Worth seeing--maybe--but how people can attach such importance to imcompetant schlock....."
4,"Great Pacing, Fun read","I was really impressed with this book. It is a good mystery, the plot develops nicely with enough twists to keep you reading on and on. I couldn't put it down!If you want to read a mystery that takes you through the in's and out's of San Francisco's seedy, sex-worker underworld take a look at this one. A great debut novel..."
3,The first N. Rose book was better!,"This book is a little more complicated than Natalia Rose's first book ""Raw food detox diet"". This book includes frequency ranges for different foods and that's too complicated for me. Other than that all the information is the same as in her first book. I think it's not necessary to own both N. Rose books and if to choose one of them, then I would rather recommend the first one!"
2,The worst performance of everyone involved.,"Do you want to watch a bad movie? Here it is! Despite of the title, the director and the casting, the result is poor. The exception is Roberto Benigni, of course, whose effort gives the small amount of comic wit you can enjoy in watching the movie; this is why we rated the second star. Apart from his comic scenes, the movie lacks continuity of action and even misses to end some minor plots, making you wonder if it will ever have a sequel, or if the director himself pitifully stopped the movie, just to avoid more boredom to the audience. If you like Peter Sellers, don't watch this movie: you will miss him. If you like Roberto Benigni, use your scissors and keep just his best performances."
2,I have seen better,This plate was less than average quality and it was undersized from what I had ordered before from another seller. The paper was coming loose around the edges and I can see white on the edge. I had to repaint the screws to match the color of the switchplate.
5,GREAT!,This figure kicks ass.She is pretty big compared to the Predators and Aliens in my collection.She is a bit smaller than the 1/4th scale Predator(totally off topic).Its a nice figure with a sweet base of the hive with a victim and chestburster action!The sculpt is amazingly detailed and the articulation is pretty good.Overall get this figure because Neca said that they might not make her.
3,Give us a DVD of Shindig.,"Given that there are now DVDs of The Ed Sullivan Show,Hullabaloo and Music Scene,how about putting Shindig out on DVD?International audiences that cannot buy NTSC videos will snap up DVDs of these shows,as will the US audience due to the better picture and sound.These videos have some great 60's acts on them and deserve DVD release."
2,Useless book for the serious collector,"Save your money and buy a current book with current pricing. This historial document shows how rapidly prices and information changes, and provides a sobering look at the need for collectors to keep up to date. ..."
4,One Foot in the Grave: Season 1-3,"Excellent, watched with my Mother and we laughed and talked for hours.One Foot in the Grave - Season 1One Foot in the Grave: Season 3"
4,Usefull for geoinformation?,I'd like to recommend this book to all who interests in multivariate analysis of geodata.
4,Just Started,"Just started reading this book, and it seems very interesting. I hope to find something in this one that I can apply in my parenting."
5,ACTION-PACKED REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF MURPHY'S LAW,"Harold Dodge is a reformed 'bird dog' who knows a cream puff when he sees one. This quiet man agrees to help a co-worker unwind a deal for a new car and get her trade in back. But everything goes wrong. Each time Harold turns around, something else happens to him. But it's sure a pleasure to see him wiggle his way out of trouble!"
2,Not what I expected,"I saw this on TV, and I thought it would be good from the sound of things. When I received this from Amazon, I tried it and was disappointed. I just think it's way too operatic. I had a really hard time hearing the words which I think is really important for hymns. The tunes were unrecognizable with over powering music and done it a way that was just not appealing. It's just something I wasn't used to."
2,Not what we expected,To us this CD was not worth the cost. To many of the hymns were only 1 or 2 verses and none were the entire hymn.
4,A nice collection of old hymns,"While I admit some of the songs are a bit obscure today, overall, it is a very nice collection of old hymns. I do enjoy many of today's young artists and the heartfelt music they put out. But sometimes, in an effort to seem more musically current and to appeal and draw people to church, I find the ""rock"" approach is more focused on the music and it loses something valuable and important in regards to worship. That is what makes the old hymns timeless and still touches the listeners heart for God. Many of the old hymns still seem anointed by the Holy Spirit-- and sadly, not always, but too often I find that lacking in much of today's Christian music. It is usually too loud and too repetitive, relying on one or two phrases or verses, repeated over and over and over and over as if that somehow indicates worship. As I said, this is just one man's opinion. But if you like the old hymns and times of quiet, reflective meditation you might enjoy this CD."
4,Prepare for Bad Packiging,"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC--WELL PRESENTED. THE GOOD OLE HYMNS FROM THE CHILDHOOD OF THE BOOMERS. THE PACKING, HOWEVER, IS SHODDY--BE CAREFUL OR YOU WILL SCRACTCH IT WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING--OR FOR THAT MATTER, BEFORE YOU EVEN GET IT OUT OF THE CASE."
5,More Than 50 Most Loved Hymns,"Beautiful music. So many favorite hymns I remember as a child. Some of the selections were instrumental - I was thinking all selections were choral. However, still a beautiful selection of hymns."
3,This CARD IS approx 36x,"This card:Kingston 2GB Secure Digital Memory Card (SD/2GB, Retail Package)IS NOT THE 120x CARD. I have a 120x and I bought this thinking they are both the same. This one is extremely slow at about 3.33x slower than the 120x which makes it a 36x in my opinion.Here is the results of my transfer test:450MB of mixed files copied from disk to hard drive:120x copied it in 45 secondsThis card copied it in 150 seconds (approx 36x, its not marked)"
4,Works with Old Devices,This is not the high capacity card. It works with old devices like old digital cameras. Good product.
4,Kingston 2GB Secure Digital Memory Card,"Kingston 2GB Secure Digital Memory Card (SD/2GB, Retail Package)Kingston is a fine brand for memory and this SD card is no exception.I'm pleased to have the 2 GB for use with my new Lumix digital camera that I also obtained through Amazon.The ease by which I was able to review the available memory options for the camera, as well as the association provided on the Amazon site for the digital camera made the selection and purchase quite easy."
3,Not compatible and slow,"I bought this 2 GB SD card from Kingston for my Archos 405 Portable Media Player but the player does not read it. It doesn't even detect it and when I get in the file manager it freezes. I also bought two 1 GB microSD cards from Kingston with SD adapters and none of them work with the Archos 405. At first I thought it was the media player but I tried it with my old 128Mb SD card I have and it works fine. I'm not blaming the cards either, they all work fine with my Kodak camera and the microSD cards work fine with my cell phones. I think it's just a compatibility problem between Archos and Kingston. If you have an Archos media player, try another brand. By the way, Archos media players can use SD HC up to 16 GB.I use it now in my camera and I can store up to 1500 photos at 5 Mpixels. That's great but it is a bit slow. There are faster SD cards in the market if you are willing to pay more."
2,Only formats to 1gb,In admin tools (microsoft)this card shows two partitions that can not be altered. You can format one of them to 1GB only. I ordered two of these and they both do the same thing.This may be repairable with other tools -but really.. what a crock.
1,Does not work!,This product was sold to be compatible with my digital frame and the computer program for the digital frame doesn't recognize the disk! I really don't know what to do and am very frustrated. Can I even return it if it's opened from the packaging?
4,kingston 2 gb secure memory card,I just put this in my camera so that I could take more pictures. Se e ms to be giving me quite a bit of them
1,Two cards died within a month of purchase,"I purchased two of these cards for use with my Sony 700SD IS camera. Within a month, both were completely dead. I have had no such problem with Sandisk or PNY cards. To make matters worse, Kingston denied my mail-in rebates for these cards.These cards are cheaper than others for a reason. Do yourself a favor and buy a better brand. Saving a few bucks on these isn't worth losing pictures."
5,Great Product!,Works great after I formated it. Its quick and the price is good! All around good product!
4,"Below $10, its a Steal!!!",Well these SD cards doesn't really go bad. You can pretty much pick up any SD card and they will last you for a while. Some are faster to read than others but I needed this SD card for something very basic. It was the cheapest one I found and Kingston has a good reputation in Memory Cards. 2GB for $10? Can't go wrong with that.
5,"Pretty good product, shipping was quick","Product has pretty good quality, but ofcourse there are faster ones in the market right now for a much higher price."
3,Hmm ... how do I open this thing?,"Well, I've bought several of these, and they seem to work fine. But I have a different problem than other people have mentioned: how do I get this thing out of its poly box? It comes in a polystyrene box for protection, which is nice. But I can't get it open. After trying for a minute or two to pop the thing open, I finally noticed ""PUSH"" molded into the plastic. Silly me, all I have to do is push ""Push"" and it'll open.Unfortunately, it didn't.So far, no amount of pushing, pulling, or prying has opened the *@#$% box. Since nobody else has complained, I must have a bad one. So I'll keep working on it. Good thing there isn't a fleeting photo opportunity I'm missing.Wish me luck."
2,Be CAREFUL when purchase from this page.,"Amazon made a horrible mistake, they gather the reviews from all kinds of kingston SD in one page. so when u look at Kingston 2GB SD, u will be surprised ! that it is being ranked 4.5 stars and people are speaking about its high speed even it has a 1.5 MB/Sec write speed! these high ranking comes from Kingston 2GB Ultimate !!!! I was fooled by this. So be CAREFUL, the reviewers here are speaking about totally different products."
1,"2 cards, DOA","My first card was dead on arrival. Replacement card was sent quickly, but it, too, was dead. Save yourself time and shipping envelopes and order something else."
5,Great Song,"Independent Woman by Destiny's Child is a very good song. It is a mix of up beat sounds and good lyrics. If there is a song you are looking this christmas, this is the one to buy."
1,It actually melted!,"I bought this teapot being a big yellow/blue fan and thought it was cute. Within 2 days part of the spout melted! I could live with that since it still worked. Then as I was boiling water one day, the whistle failed to work and by the time I got to the kettle, it was empty. I ran to shut the stove off and this pot was having a weird chemical reaction. All of the paint was crackling loudly and spewing particles all over LOUDLY and this went on for over an hour!! Even when I put it in the sink and doused water on it. It was the strangest thing I ever saw. It made me wonder what the heck it's made out of it. I've had lots of tea kettles in my day and I've never seen a pot react like that before. Do yourself a favor, get a better pot. I've had great luck with Copcos. Stainless is nice looking but way too noisy and it takes too long to boil. Good luck!ps. if you already bought it, be careful with it. Never let it get empty."
3,Handle heats up,This cute little teapot brightens up the kitchen but beware - if you use it as intended (to heat water) the handle will be hot to touch and when you force the whistletip up (to pour) steam will scald your unprotected hand. I give this one a F for design but an A for cuteness - you choose!
3,"Awesome for movies, but music lacks something","The little cubes are amazing, especially since they spread the sound to so many areas of a room (each speaker twists into two directions- for a total of 10). This is nice for me because I don't want it too loud (my walls are paper thin), but music just isn't the same on a Sat. afternoon when I want to rock out. My advice is to save your pennies and get something that carries more mid-range and bass in the satellite speakers. If it's movies that you want to enjoy, your in the right place. Lastly, the wires that Bose supplies are long and can accommodate a decent size room, but they're kinda flimsy."
1,Susan Estrich has no ideas of her own.,"This book would be better titled ""Susan Estrich: No original ideas and Clueless"". Estrich is one of the leaders of the movement to take away free speech, and she doesn't understand the truth that comes from Ann Coulter's tongue-in-cheek assessments of the socialist liberal left. Perhaps she understands all too well, and therefore this cynical book, and obvious attempt to make money by imitating and slandering a true American, is really an effort to quash the truth. The Bible says it well: In the end times, men will call good evil, and evil good. Susan is the queen of twisting good to cal it evil, and making evil sound like the norm and that which is good. Don't waste your money, unless you are doing research like Ann to understand the evil mind and black heart of those people who have the mental disease of liberalism."
1,One sided polemic,"Unfortunately, Susan Estrich has fallen into the trap of so many on the political extremes (left or right). She argues and assumes that the politics of hate are the result of the 'other' side. There was a great opportunity to highlight all those responsible for the coursening of our political process, but Ms Estrich missed that opportunity. In stead she chose to write a book about one of the villians, completely ignoring the left's (and other right wing commentators') continued continued emotional screeching.But, she chose her target well - it will sell books."
2,Interesting,"Although I wasn't too pleased to see this book published, I read it while trying my best to be as unbiased as possible. After pondering it and weighing it against Miss Ann's offering, all I can say is this:Someone who makes a parody of a parody is not going to great lengths to convince me they attended Harvard.I think it's ironic that the author entitled the book ""Soulless"" as Estrich has some of the most skewed views on God and religion in general."
5,Fabulous!,"This is the best CD, I've been borrowing it from a friend and I just keep listening to it over and over again while I work. It's mellow and nostalgic and just fabulous!"
4,This is durable but ...........,"My daughter loved this set because it won't break and make her cry (like the porcelain sets) but the designs on the pieces are stickers, not painted on. That was a little disappointing to her. As a mom I love educational toys but that is not the reason you buy a tea set, this is pure fun. My daughter's kitten and stuffed animals have enjoyed many tea parties with her."
1,WTF!,"I previewed this movie for FREE right here on Amazon! I feel bad for EVERYONE who paid for this PERIOD! Worst five minutes of my life! Writing this review to warn all on lookers is the the reprieve from those five minutes. I still don't know what's so great about, as this movie is a testment to the worlds top 5 worst movies every made. A complete joke. To top it off, when asked to rate this movie - it's SO bad, I wish I could leave the stars EMPTY! Please watch the preview before you waste your time or money, you will thank me for doing so!"
1,Terrence Malick Wannabe,"Dear David Gordon Green,I know what you are doing. Its not working.In ""George Washington,"" David Gordon Green tries to extract the natural beauty and poetic simplicity of Terrence Malick's films to the point of absurdity. The quick cuts to nature shots, the pseudo-casual speaking tone of children who stutter and say ""oh-so profound"" things...This dvd contains his student films, which speak for themselves to show you what a talentless filmmaker this guy is. His Charlie Rose interview is nauseating. He lets Charlie stroke his ego about what an interesting new visionary he is....Sickening and insulting.Go buy Badlands and humble David Gordon Green before the master...TERRENCE MALICK"
4,Alan Wilson's Last Recordings.,"It's not one of the best Canned Heat albums, but it's worth buying because it contains a couple of tracks with Alan Wilson's last recordings.That said, the album also have some good songs and catchy tunes, although it's a later Canned Heat line-up. All in all, the album is a nice effort and I commend Canned Heat for carrying on after Alan Wilson's death. That was no easy task as the die hard fans will know."
4,"Crisp, clean and high quality, but not loud enough","I was lucky enough to find the Acoustamass 6 system at Sam's club coupled with JVC amplifier/tuner for a little less than you would pay for both if purchased separately. Bose lives up to their reputation for quality sound, but I found the system to be lacking in sheer ear-bleeding amplitude. The system can be run safely (100 W per channel) at maximum volume, but it simply doesn't get as loud as I think it should. Otherwise, I have no complaints about this fine product from Bose."
3,They're okay,"I wish they came with a mic to answer calls, because the sound is great. I guess I'll only use them for my ipod vs. my iphone"
3,Awesome quality in every respect...except they hurt ur ears!,"These earbud headphones sound awesome and are quality. The only thing is that the earbuds hurt ur ear. I may have small ears which is causing the problem, but even with the cushion heads they pain me. I suggest u go into a store and try them on before you buy."
1,Broken within one week,"Dropped these earphones on the floor one time, a few days after receiving them, and one of the plastic cap fell of. Really bad quality!"
1,for small size buy IN THE EAR CANAL type earphone,"my this earbud headphone is poor in bass response comapared to my sony mdr g-54lp(beware mdr-g54lp and mdr g54lp is two different models there is difference of - sign) actually in experts view this type small earbuds use to give poor sound this is true with any brand and model so never buy earbud type small headphone if you want small headphone buy IN THE EAR CANAL type headphone in experts view this type in ear earphone use to give good crystal clear sound example sony mdr ex 71 / 81, shure e2c etc. if bigger headphone is ok than buy mdr-g54lp"
5,Great Earphones,Bought these for a friend. An boy does she loves them. The bass is good and they perform the same as $40 headphones. Which I knew about these before.
2,retractable ear phones,"They were bulky, didn't seem to work smoothly. It was much easier to wrap the cord in my pocket. As a result, I sent them back. They may work for some people."
4,Good Buy!,"Just got them today and I'm very impressed. I love the design in comparison to the other headphones I've used. The design actually reduces outside noise for high-intensity listening and helps generate a powerful, resonant bass response. Based on the reviews, I believe this is money worth spent. Also, the carry on case that the ear buds come with is very convenient. Having to constantly detangle the cord in my handbag is bothersome. This case practically saves me the time and energy!"
5,A crosbowman's story of the first exploration of the amazon,"This historical novel, out of print, was reasonably priced, mailed in a secure package, and is in the very good condition at which it was advertised. Reliable vendor."
4,Wolfpac Rocks,"Well first and formost they didn't send me the cover of the naked chick on the front. But oh well the Wolfpac is one of the best things in rock nowadays combinding rock and rap music genious, Unlike these crying little bitchs that you see on MTV they keep the real tradition of rock that has been going on for 50 years strong. But they still got a little ways to go yet before you could classif them as legends."
2,WHERE'S THE INTENSITY?,"I don't understand why people gave this five stars. This album has weak or little build-ups if any, and is just kind of plain. I agree with the other two reviewers who gave it lower than 5 stars. I go clubbing a lot, and am able to get a wide range of hard club music, trance/progressive house. This album would get NO play anywhere. I have heard that D-FUSE is a good DJ, but his album is nothing to get excited about. This only contains 1 or 2 tight tracks on it. Weak, mellow, and garbage, is what it is. DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!"
2,a disappointment,"I *want* to like this album, I really do. I loved Psychotrance 2000, and had high hopes for the 2001 edition. What a letdown! The bulk of the album is a series of stale, repetitive drum loops with little variation and only the occasional melodic or vocal ornamentation. The last four tracks provide just a tease of redemption, pulling my rating up to two stars...but it just wasn't enough."
4,Ten On One 1987,".The compilation of her Hit-Singles in her most popular times.Her next albums contain some good songs, but they were bad in Charts.."
5,Very Practical Book,"I have found this book to be very useful with practical examples and case studies. I felt that as an engineer I needed to know how to use software(to save time)along with the formulas that work in it.This book satisfies that, using a very common software EXCEL..what could be better than this.I strongly recommend this book for a high level course in statistics."
1,"Not ""Good"" condition!","When book arrived, it was together, barely, by just a thin bit of paper on the spine. Inside, the glue of the book was cracked all the way back to the spine. After the second time I opened it, the book ripped in two, leaving me with two halves of a book. Would not recommend this seller!!!"
5,Totally eating words,"I do not often leave reviews; but this was more than warranted. I had my doubts about this product. After my experience with the people at ""Hi-Tech-Dealz,"" my mind was changed.This product is simple, efficient, and effortless! Works great with Sony cameras. If you need this product, ""Hi-Tech-Dealz"" is DEFINITELY the company to order from. Not only does it work well, it also arrives in a VERY TIMELY manner."
5,Don't get Wrenched Up.,With this larger than usual wrench one can get the job done on things like trailer hitches and other big bolts and nuts.
5,Used Books,"Excellent service by Book seller. Very, very good value because there is no way to determine that this was a used book. It was as good as New."
4,"Good, Not Great","Normally I am an enthusiastic Sasha fan and, while I haven't heard a lot of Digweed's solo work, I've liked what I've heard. Indeed I liked this album, but I didn't love it. There are some very nice tracks (Bedrock - Voices, Breeder - Tyrantanic and Luzon - The Bagio Track spring to mind) but overall, listening to this cd was not a memorable experience. The mixing is smooth, nothing revolutionary, but it works. I think the problem lies in the arraignment of the tracks. Unlike better mix compilations, Communicate fails to take me on a journey. The momentum of many of the songs is never used to its full effect. Again, not a bad cd, but for Sasha and Digweed at their best, look to their Northern Exposure work."
3,OKEY,"I bought this cd because they told me that it's was great, but it's just the same sound of the other Shasha & digweed disc, well it's good but i has espectin more track 3 and 7 of the 1st cd are excelent and track 5,6 and 8 of the 2nd cd are good to......"
2,"Boring, boring, boring.... are you bored yet?","This is a back-burner kind of disc, nothing to get excited about when you pull it off your cd rack, ditto for GU13:Ibiza. It gets old after the 4th or 5th time you listen to it. Your money is better spent on the Northern Exposure series."
3,...getting a little old,"This album is an excellent example of what is happening to trance, and who better to lead the way to stagnation than the two powerhouses of trance in tandem. While the mixing is most certainly impeccable, as we would only expect from Sasha and Digweed, the track selection and repetitive sound makes one wonder what went wrong between Expeditions and here, and a quick comparison to Northern Exposure Eastcoast and the rollercoaster it brings begs the question of how Sasha and Digweed plan to breathe some new life into their music."
3,A bunch of average tracks blended together well!,"Well after Northern Exposure i was looking forward to this one but hmmmm...i'm not so sure it was what i expected. I still like it - it suits the listener who pays close attention but essentially, not one track on this CD is memorable in its own right. The atmosphere is ok - suits driving which is where my copy of this CD stays now - but if these guys are trying to shape the music for the masses then i beg you not to follow. Bland, thoughtful, whispy - music that wouldn't otherwise have cut it if S&D hadn't got their hands on it if you get my drift! It arrived on the same day as three Trance CDs from new MP3.com artists WerkStadt (German i think), Psychobabble (er, have i spelt that right?) and SubLiner and frankly, i prefered each of these, so there you go."
3,where's the real trance?,"i spent enough money on this damn cd, so I feel i have the right to give it it's just review. Simply put, I feel that this cd moves at an incredibly slow, sometimes painful pace. But that's to be expected from this ever-popular duo. Yes these two are so mainstream now a lot of ""fans"" label them popular and think there the best by far, hands down. But my flava lies with energetic trance that closes your eyes and takes you to a better place. An overall good cd, but perhaps alcohol could make it better...yes?"
1,Ugh,"I finally gave up on this book.I was almost 3/4 into it last night and I wondered - ""why am I suffering through this?"" I have so many other books on my shelves that need mny attention and I put it away and moved on to something interesting. I wanted to like this book; the idea of it seemed appealing. The fact is, I found the main character to be a really loathsome, tiresome, and un-likeable. The man had no honor and he had no real virtues - I didn't care about him or his juvenile sex obsession (too much time discussing body parts and onanism) and the entries in his ""diary"" caused me to like him less and less. Meeting Picasso or Edward VIII along the way didn't provide enough interest to enable me to get over my dislike for, and boredom with, the narrator. I want the hours I wasted reading this book back."
4,Good by too much like New Confessions,"I enjoyed William Boyd's previous novels - The Ice Cream War was particularly fun, and New Confessions was a great read. Any Human Heart is also an excellent book. What will stay with me for a long time is the upbeat ending. It didn't have to be this way, given Logan's ups and downs and seemingly modest achievements. But the fact that it is gives us a happy-ending type feeling which I think is a real treat from Boyd and a real show of appreciation for life.What dissapoints a bit is how similir the book is to New Confessions. That book has similar ""ups and downs and modest achievements"" over a similar scan of 20th century events and locations told by a similar main character. Having read New Confessions (though quite some time ago) made Any Human Heart feel predictable. Had a never read the former I may have well thought the latter a near-classic"
5,culmination of boyd's awesome career,"this novel is so brilliant, so swiftly paced and poetically composed, i can hardly do it justice. i have read (and taught in university courses) Boyd's books over and over again down the years (a fav is The New Confessions) and Any Human Heart rates right up there with the best work he's done. there's a real melancholia evident here--so those who are looking for the hilarity of such early works as A Good Man in Africa or On the Yankee Station are gonna be puzzled a tad. Logan Mountstuart is a great creation...so pleased, especially as i didn't like Armadillo and The Blue Afternoon--despite the fact that, with Ian McEwan, Wm Boyd is my favorite contemporary novelist. get this as soon as you can..."
4,a literary Forrest Gump bio; it's better than it sounds..,"'Any Human Heart' is the autobiography of a fictitious twentieth century literary character, Logan Mountstuart. Despite his rather dodgy name, this character grows up into a rather interesting man. It is especially his older life when he reflects upon disappointments and the overall value of his life does this book really catch fire - I found it to be most moving.Unfortunately all is not perfect. The author decided to ""be cute"" by having Logan Mountstuart be personal friends of famous twentieth century characters such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Hemingway, and Virginia Woolf. Some readers might find this to add extra spice to the story. I found it exploitative and totally unnecessary - the book is solid enough. At any rate this Forrest Gump-like diversions really don't spoil this fine book.Bottom line: a very worthy read. William Boyd is in fine form."
5,Easy to travel with kids now,"This helps out a lot when you travel with kids. I am able to charge my phone, have 2 DVD players going or the kids and charge a DS too. Easy to use too. I used a strip of adhesive Velcro to keep it in place."
2,Draws Power Even When Not Being Used,"This unit is well designed however because of the LED light on it, it continues using power even when nothing is connected. Thus you must unplug it after each use. If you don't, after four days you'll come back to a pickup with a dead battery, like I did. When looking at the product description and photo before buying, it didn't appear to have a light on it. I am not impressed. There is no way to disable the LED without tearing the unit apart."
5,Great little accessory!,Used on a vacation trip to Canada to use vehicle power for laptop with GPS device and an MP3 player. Worked very well.
5,Car Power Port Splitter (1 to 4 ports),In the past I have had splitters that were poorly made and intermittently had connection interruptions as the car drove down the highway hitting bumps and holes in the road. This is not the case with the Lenmar SPP-04 Power Port 4 outlet splitter. It is well constructed and I have had no trouble with loose connections. I highly recommend this product if you need additional power ports in your car.
1,Never worked from the start,"Installed the product, plugged it into the cigarette lighter socket and nothing: No light on the unit, no power to any devices plugged into it. Tried another adapter, nothing again. Checked fuses and the vehicle fuse was blown. Replaced that, plugged in other adapter and everything worked. Plugged in this product without anything plugged into it and again no light. Checked vehicle fuse and it was blown again. Tried plugging product into a cigarette lighter socket connected directly to the vehicle battery, and no light on the product. Product is now in the trash...it wasn't worth the postage to return it. I don't plan on purchasing any more Lenmar products!"
5,Works perfectly,"I purchased a few seat-heaters for our car and needed the extra ports. This works like a charm. Sometimes a little wiggle is needed, but otherwise works great! Love having the extra ports for charging electronics on road trips."
5,Finally!,"Finally, I don't have to keep unplugging one item to charge another! I had no idea products like these were even available, but holy cow does it make life easier. I do roadside assistance and I have a GPS, an iPhone, and another cell phone plus a portable tire inflator. That's FOUR items I have to keep plugged in.This thing is a MUST have item! I love it."
5,my new favorite composer,"and this is the 2nd of his ""favorite hits"" compilations. i can't wait to get the 1st. some tunes have cheesy arrangements but the emotional coefficient in this guy's melodies has to be one of the highest in this genre. i have no idea what the lyrics are nor does it matter to me. the melodies and phrasing provide more than enough to fabricate my own narrative, and isn't that more fun anyway?"
5,Perfect,"This product is just like in the picture shown. Very cute, and works great. This is not a toy though, it's a radio and alarm clock. My daughter loved it."
1,worked for three days,"bought this alarm clock for my step-daughter to start the school year, she loved the look and the radio- which incidentally is the only thing working after three days, the display has gone completely blank so it's no longer a clock or an alarm, beyond the return window since I bought it early and hung onto it to give to her later, don't waste your money"
4,"A amazing, longlasting alarm clock","I got this alarm clock for my 8 birthday, and I'm turning 13 this year ad it still works and is showing no sign of dieing. It's cute, has a radio, and alarm, time, AND a night light that helped ween me off my room light. It has 2 differnet types of alarms, sleep, and offers both AM and FM. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because it has that old spinny dial to find the station, and it takes me about 10 mintues to find mine. Over all agreat buy, and lasts VERY long."
4,The Man Who Loved Women,"There are parts of this movie that I did not care for, but Julie Andrews' role of therapist was well done. The end was sad with David's death, but all in all it was a fair movie to watch. I would not recommend it for family viewing."
1,The worst action film ever,"This is the worst action film I've ever seen. The acting is amateurish, the fight scenes look like two year olds at play, and the dialog sounds like a bad translation of a bad foreign film. How anyone could rate this as watchable is beyond me."
4,"A Great ""Guy"" Toy!!","It's big, it's bulky, it's heavy; it's completely impractical-and it's terrific! This is a fully functional telephone, modeled after the field telephone carried by Lindbergh on his famous solo Atlanic flight. The top case has a working compass, and a series of lights which flash in sequence to display the route of Lindbergh's flight when the phone rings.The receiver isn't a plastic toy-it has a satisfying heft; the cord retracts into the base; the buttons for redial and speed dial are big chunky push buttons. This is a ""retro"" phone in the best sense-smoothly functional and up-to-date technology without the feel of being a plastic knock-off.If you're looking for a telephone to compliment a den, library, etc. this is a handsomely crafted & interesting item."
4,"An enjoyable, if light, three hour film","The Bottom Line:I watched this film because the concept of ensemble casts and multiple storylines appeals to me (for some reason I can't fully explain) and I left the film relatively pleased; sure Andie McDowell isn't a great actress, sure there isn't really any deep material in the film, sure the thread with Lily Tomlin is uninvolving, and sure I'm sure it isn't Magnolia, but if you're just looking to kill 180 minutes without getting bored it'll work just fine.3/4"
2,Dreadful,"This movie receive two stars because there is a scene of Tom Waits dancing around with a leis on; otherwise, I would have given the film only one star. Boring, long, and completely loses the minimalistic and ""surprise"" quality of Raymond Carver's stories. I suggest you visit your local library and check out the book!"
5,camcorder battery,I had bought a new camcorder for my christmas from a pawn shop for $60.00 But the battery was the only thing not working. So I ordered a new one from Amazon stores. It works perfectly now. I love my new camcorder. I look forward to using it again and again. I am very happy with Amazon service.
2,why is it so hard to find great animation with a great story,"Yes the story is good, but.........but if a movie isn't visually stunning to me it doesn't work for me. As with most Anime they have great stories, but alot lack in art work. This is one of them. I bought it because it said that it was done by some of the greats in the anime field. I would have to say it's just not worth the money."
2,2 Lame,"Another DEEP film by this director. It is so deep that not even God could ""get"" it. I could even make a film if I didn't have to offer a plot. No art here."
2,MOVIES DON'T HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINING,"the director of this movie actually said that, at some point: movies don't have to be entertaining.lots of pretentious european directors actually felt that way, even into the 1970s---which is why movie goers went nuts over entertaining movies like JAWS and STAR WARS.a lot of the images in the movie have the look of a painting---and are as exciting as watching paint dry.a young richard harris is in this movie----with a dubbed into italian voice!the non-plot has to do with alienation and pollution, all done in a sloooow, and quiet, european, fashion; i.e., boring and pretentious."
4,Just love it,I got one of these 5 years ago and live in an apartment. I set 2 of them up in a cut out between my livingroom and kitchen. I do not have food odors within 2 hours of cooking. This includes bacon. It helped my allergies as well. One of my units quit working and I didn't notice any change but last week when the second one broke I was freaking. My allergies got worse and my apartment smelled like food and for the first time I smelled my cat. As you can see I am on here ordering another one I can't live without it.
4,Good book,"Good book. Well written. See my review for the companion resource video. The book is well written and contains lots of ""technical"" information. Could use some more stories for illustrations."
5,Amazing!,"I had a very expensive cashmere sweater that I wanted to change the color, I'll admit I was a little sceptical at first. I had never dyed anything with an acid dye before. It's quit a different process than regular dying,but I read the directions carefully and forged ahead It turned out amazing I now have a brand new sweater."
3,Lush,"Occasionally suggestive of a Tim Burton movie score (especially Edward Scissorhands -- though maybe it's just my imagination), this is an interesting update on the theme of traditional Japanese vocals in modern settings, and/or East-meets-West technological culture clash.Frequently beautiful and moving. Synths are used mainly as atmosphere, with a minimum of contemporary pop's tendency to dress everything in a pastiche of ""beats.""""Mai"" is the rare jewel in the all-too-frequently disappointing Pacific Moon catalog."
4,Very pretty and interesting to the ears!,Reminds me of Adiemus.A voice sweet as sugar.This Eri Sugai is obviously a very creative and talented person!
5,Outstanding!,"I am quite pleased with this cd. I may not understand the words, but the music is truely universal. The harmonies, and the many different melodies intertwining so perfectly leaves you longing for more chances to listen. Every time I've played Mai, I have heard something new weaved into the songs. I am looking forward to seeing future albums from Eri Sugai.Be Safe and Be Well."
1,Inaccurate,"The track listing for this CD is inaccurate & I paid the full price for it! Amazon, please take note of this! Here is the correct track list:1. Kahoolawe - Jon Basebase2. Baby Love - Quintinn Holi3. Break These Walls - Glenn Medeiros4. Tropical Beauty - 5:055. Sunlight - Quintinn Holi6. Hey Local Boy - Core Lokelani & Travis7. Sailor's Lament - Jon Basebase8. Feel It - Cory Lokelani & Travis9. Fell Like Making Love - Code 80810. We Don't Say I Love You Anymore - Glenn Medeiros11. Quiet Nights With You - Wayne Takamine12. Diana - 5:0513. Rock 2 The Rhythm - Club Rox Rock14. It's Christmas Time - Club Rox Rock15. We Need A Hook - Club Rox Rock16. We Don't Say I Love You Anymore (Midnight Mix) - Glenn Medeiros17. Princessa - Lester Gantan"
3,"So-so camera, eats battery like crazy!","I got this camera as a gift after my previous digital camera broke. The only problem was that I tried to use it with AA batteries, and I could not even turn on the camera. I figured out that this camera will not work without the Sony Stamina battery, and that the Kit (rechargable battery, charger and bag), which costs almost ($$$).After that initial problem, it's been only good times with this camera. The pictures quality are great, and the camera is really easy to use, without those complicated menus that others digital cameras have. Uploading the files (pictures) to my computer was easy, and now that I'm using Windows XP is a lot better.If you're looking for an easy-to-use, high-quality camera, this is a good choice for you. However, keep in mind that you'll need to expend a ($$$) more for the battery kit.Picture colors are not good at all, I'll choose a Canon next time"
4,"Good Quality, Good Features...","I really like this camera. It's my first digital camera and I'm not at all into photography as a hobby, so I can't speak to the complaints people listed about it being 41 mm, etc. But if you're not looking for a professional's camera, this works great. DEFINITELY buy the battery pack... it's somewhat pricey but well worth it... using batteries is just a waste and you'd spend the amount of the lithium pack in batteries relatively quickly. You'll also need to buy a new memory stick, the 4 MB it comes with doesn't do much for you. I use my camera mainly for e-mail pics and web posting and have found this was a good purchase, I'm very happy with it."
5,Simply Great,Its amazing to know how much Islam has contributed to the world. This video is a great presentation of it.
5,Spellbinding !,"This documentary beautifully reminds those of us who may have forgotten of the incredible contribution of islam to western culture. Unlike many documentaries it is stunningly photographed, and made so entertaining that I was unable to stop watching for a moment. It should be required viewing for any American quick to dismiss islam as a religion of the uneducated masses!"
2,Imcomplete picture,"This series is compromised by what can only be described as, ""Western ignorance."" While it provides a certain amount of solid information regarding various aspects of Islam, it displays a surprising amount of ignorance in regard to Byzantium and the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox and their Muslim neighbors. The series' writers do not take the time to explain the differences between what really amounted to a Greek East and a Latin West; this gross oversight results in many puzzling and confusing details.... In all, there are too many historical lapses for a complete picture to emerge."
1,Empire of what?,Another contribution into the cause of Islamic apologetics. For people that want to convert only.
2,"Politically correct ""half-true"" documentary","Very beautifully done, however the content really bugged me. It will be very difficult for someone who's relying on this information to really know whether the material is true or not since it was presented in a very ""politically correct"" nature that Islam has to be great regardless. Even pushing the limit to suggest that Islam invented gun powder, paper, and silk, while these three were invented by the Chinese, whose knowledge can certainly be transferred through the trades.I started the video with full anticipation to understand more about Islam, but after I saw the facts were presented carelessly, I'm not so sure if I can believe what I ""learned"" from this video.Two stars is just for the presentation, and ""0"" for content as I don't know which part I should take as truth and which part is fabrication to stay in line with political correctness."
3,Dazzling! Epic! Somewhat superficial!,"Stirring, beautifully photographed, overflowing with impressive artistic and scientific achievements, this documentary delivered a truly obsequious and fawning overview of an often misunderstood culture. Wisely avoiding an international firestorm of hatred, Mr. Kingsley's narration sensitively pulled every punch that might have reflected poorly on the topic at hand. The international commentators produced a thin veneer of scholarly analysis without all the tiresome strife that questioning, debate, and independent thought sometimes cause. Thank you, PBS, for funding such a shallow, whitewashed look at our neighbors across the sea."
5,An Excellent Book,"Should you buy this book? If you have an interest in it's subject matter (early/mid '90's alternative music), then the answer is an emphatic yes. Just be aware that it is limited to this area of rock. If you're still interested, then you should be very happy with this guide."
3,Even shorter than it looks,"Be warned that this already-thin book contains wide swaths of ""sample"" documentation describing the project referred to throughout. Probably about forty or fifty pages of such. The rest of the content is good, however."
3,Useful introduction to Use case concepts,"A useful introduction to use case concepts in an easy to read style, although the case study dialog that other reviwers have mentioned does rather spoil the book - does it really matter that Tara can cook? (p12). However, overall a useful addition to your OO library - particularly as there are so few good books on the subject."
2,not so smooth,"Pretty smooth movement except when panning left and right.. then it jerks my camera. If it is especially for camcorders, as the description said, it should not jerk at all."
2,Think twice before you buy!!!,"I took the plunge and bought this camera. I liked the style and the features, I read the reviews and disbelieved the battery problems. Everyting everybody writes here is is true...this thing eats up batteries like you won't believe! 15 - 20 minutes per pair of batteries max. Wow. It's incredibly frustrating. Then, if you want to upgrade to the Lithium battery, . . . the charger, the DC adaptor, or upgrade the memory (the 4MB is a joke) to 32MB, etc. etc All are sold seperately. You can't just grab some no name accesories either. It must be ($$$$) Sony!I returned this camera in less than 12 hours after purchasing. I won't be tethered to Sony for the rest of my life. If you want a similar camera, at the same price, that has more memory(16MB), uses RECHARGEABLE long-life Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries and includes the charger, try the FujiFilm FinePix 2600 Zoom.Buyer beware! The Sony has great features. But what good are they when the batteries keep dying?"
3,"DCS-P30 Love It, But Hate It.","When I went out to buy a digital camera, the only one that I found within my budget that was built as good as the expensive ones was the P30. It had all the features I was looking for, so I bought it. When I took the memory stick into town to have the pictures made into prints, everyone told me that they couldn't develop prints from the Sony Memory Sticks. So, there I was with a camera that I loved, but couldn't use because no one developed prints from the Memory Stick. The moral of the story is, only buy cameras that use the Lexmar style cards."
1,Product came incomplete,"I have pay for this camera, it came, but incomplete,This is the second time I have by a camera, in the two ocations came without cables, memory stick and no charger cables.How can I use it when there is no memory stick or the USB cables ???Please send your coments."
2,"Tons of functionnality, short battery life","It's my first digital camera, and I don't know if this battery issue is shared by other brands and models. However, the fact that an AC adapter and a rechargable battery are expensive options certainly doesn't help to forgive this camera's battery life. Apart from that, it's quality is very good, and it has a lot of functionnalities. It is everything I expected from a digital camera when I decided to buy one, and more. UPDATE: I have seriously demoted this camera rating from 4 to two stars after mine just broke a few months after the warranty expired."
3,Great pics but beware of included accessories...,"The DSC-P30 is a great beginner digital camera (...). The pictures turned out great. The optical zoom works well. Ignore the digital zoom as it pixelises the snap. The LCD is pretty crisp and clear. The menu is also very intuitive. Its got a host of other attractive features.On the darker side, the accessories included are no great guns. Only a (...) 4MB memory stick is included. Even the battery is optional. So you have to spend (...) more for battery, AC adapter and an additional 64MB memory stick."
3,Good camera if you can afford the batteries,"Good camera, with lots of features, EXCEPT battery life. Tried alkaline AA batteries and got about 10 minutes on the first set. Finally turned off LCD and flash and got more time, but no AC adapter means using the batteries to transfer pics to the PC. I got tired of this, returned the camera, and bought the DSC-P31, which has 2.1 Megapixel AND has the NMH batteries with recharge. Only has 3X digital zoom, but otherwise it is similar to the P30. Also comes with 8MB memory stick instead of 4."
4,Its a good camera....if you can afford the Ion battery,"The camera is small, neat, spiffy and works well. Easy to use. Only problem so far it eats batteries like nobodies business. the first pack lasted all of six pictures. Mind you I was playing around with the LCD but man. Next pack was almost just as bad - perhaps a dozen pics. I have gone through about 4 sets of batteries quick. Ran a test to see how many shots I could get on fresh batteries. Got 55 with the LCD on and flash by taking shot after shot. Got 185 with flash on but no LCD, again just taking shot after shot. Looks like the batteries must be draining if left in the unit 'cause I can't see why the first few sets got only a few pics.....anyhow I ordered the Ion battery....we'll see..."
2,Not impressed,"I read through the first 2/3 of the book and decided that was enough for me. I've read some powerful self-help material but this is not it. The author really lost me when he said, ""make every choice for me and me only."" In other words, he was discussing how being true to yourself is the absolute end-all-be-all. He gave an example of his friend really needing to talk when she was upset but he was wanting to sit down and do some writing. So his advice and solution is to totally reject his friend and take care of his own needs. Then later he goes to her and is ""fully engaged"" to listen to her and take care of her needs.There are some nuggets of truth and some profound ideas in this book. But it has such a selfish premise under it all that I just couldn't swallow it.I want to learn how to be nice WHILE I'm being real.Since I spent good money on this I couldn't bear to throw it away so I gave it to my therapist. In hind site, I wish I had thrown it away."
3,Meets my need for humour,Kelly's book was the funniest presentation of NVC I've read. This makes it stand out from the others. I recommend it for a different flavour of NVC learning.
2,Extremely Cheesy Bigfoot B-Movie.,"Fans of Bigfoot movies will probably like this one, but it is not in the least bit scary and yes the bigfoot creature does look just like a man in a suite.Essentially ""Creature From Black Lake"" is about two young anthropologists who are given a grant to go look for a bigfoot type creature in Louisiana. Along the way there is lots of corny segments involving girls and a run-in with the law. In the end they manage to track down bigfoot and end up in a bid for survival.There is really only one good thing about this movie - Dean Cundy does a great job of the cinematography. Apart from that it is extremely cheesy and is only for bigfoot completists that must have everything. If you want to see a good cheesy Bigfoot movie then see ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" instead."
1,Doesn't work,"Program literally doesn't run--just generates an error report to send to Microsoft. Have un-installed and re-installed 3xs to no avail. There is no information as to where to get support, and no help area on the www.familyfn.com website. Luckily I only paid $5 s/h for it--she's giving them away on her website."
4,What a mix!,"This is the first ""Over the Rhine,"" cd I've heard, and it's a pleasant surprise. The genres are mixed, and you get a little country, a little Kurt Weil cabaret, a little folk, some jazzy sort of pop, and a lot of music. It's a collection that got me in its cumulative effect. The first track had me wondering if I hadn't made a mistake, and if the disc wasn't going to put me right to sleep. Well, I didn't nod off, and the disc grew on me. It's a mellow listen, with good musicianship and lyrics, and well worth the purchase."
5,awasome product,"there is lot of uses of this neem capsules one of the most common is to lower down the sugar levels, check on the web for other alternatives uses and products made of neem like neem oil or neem soap."
1,"Shipped wrong product, would not accept return","This co. shipped me the wrong product. After repeated phone calls attempting to return it, I finally gave up. When I finally got through to a live person, she transferred me to somebody elses voicemail. Therefore, I have taken a complete loss on the cost of the product."
5,The Temps never sounded better!,"Sure, we can depend on Sinatra, Bennett, Peggy, Sammy, but the TEMPTATIONS doing ""Night & Day"" is a real nice surprise with all those strings! Not only a terrific movie, with the most NATURAL performances, but a real satisfying soundtrack as well!"
4,IF you were wondering...,"This is pretty much a complete (great) album from the movie, but if you wanted to know what that song was playing during the prom scene, it was, ""It's All Your Fault"" by Wild Orchid."
5,The ultimate feel good soundtrack!,"As soon as I rented this movie, I ran out and bought the CD. This is the ultimate feel good mix! The different types of music complement each other. This is the best CD to blast while you're dancing around your living room!An instant pick-me- up."
2,Aweful vibration noise when lid closes,Bought this from a bed and bath store and about three months after we got it it started making an aweful vibrating noise as the lid closes...its LOUD and super annoying. We have to return it. Otherwise a great trash bin.
5,Really like this product!,"I bought a cheaper one with a plastic lid from a warehouse store and the lid broke after less than 18 months. My friend bought a butterfly opening version of this can at least 4 years ago and it is still working great. So I opted to upgrade to this Simple Human. So far I am really liking it. Cleans up nicely, bag stays where I put it, and the step mechanism is quiet and lowers slowly enough that I can get a second handful of trash in."
5,Such an OUTSTANDING trashcan!!!!,"I purchased this trashcan from Lowe's (for the same price) one night after going over it in my mind for MONTHS why one would EVER spend so money on a trashcan. Well, let me tell you: It's worth every single penny. The size, quality, color, mechanics of it (the lid slowly closes once you take your foot off of the pedal) are great, and it's easy for me to clean. I'd buy this thing all over again- but much, much sooner than it took me this time. lol I highly recommend it!By the way, you don't have to buy the trashbags made by simplehuman for this size trashcan. You can just use tall kitchen trashbags."
1,another waste of money,"I confess I was an idiot and bought this. $[...] for a stupid place to put garbage? It dents so easily, the bag pokes out over the edge, and it's very hard to clean, or at least to make it shiny. Save your money. This is what I call a scam. It's a trash can. But probably my biggest complaint is that it is hard to keep it looking shiny. Get one fingerprint on it and the oil from the finger print will take you an hour to polish. If you think ""stainless steel"" is a magic thing, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. ;)"
1,Buyer beware!,I was so excited to see the 13 gallon trashcan for such as good price...don't be fooled!I received the first trash can and not only was it dented but it was the 10 gallon. After much run around I was shipped another one...not dented BUT STILL A 10 GALLON! After 2 attempts to get the right one shipped to me they finally came to the conclusion that they don't actually carry the 13 gallon!!Not only did I have to ship both back one came from UPS and the other FedX! Buy from another seller that actually has the 13 gallon!
2,way over-rated,"It holds trash, yes. But it dents easily, and gets dirty easily. Making this thing shine is a part-time job. It looks nice out of the box, but get a few finger prints on it and it'll take you forever to clean. The words ""stainless steal"" are pretty deceptive, as experienced people know. If you are buying this for looks, good luck. It will look dirty unless you have a lot of spare time to polish it. But if you goal is just to throw trash away, don't spend $100. Just get something simple."
1,customer beware,"This is a very stylish unit and worked perfectly. About one year later, the top unit broke. There are plastic tabs that hold the metal rod in place that are flimsy and snapped. No way to repair it. I unfortunately lost the receipt and tried to contact the manufacturer and they refused to answer any correspondance about their so called warranty. For $100 its nice and expensive and becomes more expensive if you have to replace it every year."
5,Free For All,Great song and whole albujm is fun to listen to anytime. this song is one of the best on this album.
2,"Good idea,bad movie","What a disappointment. After viewing the trailer, I was hoping for a fun,silly movie in the lines of Home Alone or even Dennis the Menance. Not even close! A young boy tries to drive off all babysitters so his parents will spend more time at home. This movie plays more like a tv show. Some tired jokes played by a very weak cast with no direction. And yes, Danny Trejo is the tough babysitter in about 2 scenes. Very young children may like this,but if you are over the age of 6, skip this one!"
3,MORE HYPE THAN SUBSTANCE!,"Everyone is praising this as the best thing Eels have ever done. Yet, once again, I beg to differ with the masses. I consider myself a fan, as I own all of their prevoius work and enjoy most of it quite a bit. But this album is not only boring and repetitive; it is one disc too many. After a while, half of these songs sound the same. This album could have been trimmed down to one disc, and perhaps kept some sort of flow, and not lost my attention so quickly!"
5,This is the Greatest,Can't say much except if you like good music this is some of the best of the year.
4,Review of mySQL for Dummies,This very readable text does what it sets out to do - gives the reader a full appreciation of the power and initial usage of mySQL and PHP.
5,"great reliable, single-needed resource","If you want to hike 14ers and are pretty much new to it but want to learn, this is the book for you. It will explain all possible routes to a peak, how to get there, and what to expect. The only possible other resource you'd want is a topo map of the area, or even look online ahead of time.This book is the the most reliable of the area on 14er hikes."
4,Great Camera,"I purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago. It's my first digital camera, and I must say that I am extremely satisfied with its features and performance. I even purchased the long life battery to go with it. I find it's battery life indicator to be helpful. The photo quality is exceptional depending on the resoloution level you set it at. The use of floppy disk or memory stick gives you even more options. It also has an indicator for the amount of room left on the disk for more pictures. I highly recommend this camera."
1,Shipping,"I have ordered 5 nostalgic DVD's back in October, paid for them on 22/10/09 and to date (08/03/10)have not received them. I have written many emails and am still waiting for a response. Not even a gesture of a refund or a replacement, I am not made of money and work extremely long hours just to afford a few of life's little pleasures.For a multi million (billion) dollar industry you people who work there should be ashamed of themselves. Do what you get paid for and follow this up! One person believe it or not does make a difference!signedReally Pissed off!!!"
4,"Good, prompt service","Easy to order, received in time and in very good condition. Would buy from this person again."
4,Very good buy for lover's of 80's music!,"I purchased this cd for the song, ""Goin' Down"". It was a favorite of mine that I heard on the radio, and I had to buy the 45, during the time when 45's were really cool. Just that song itself is enough to buy the cd for, but after listening to it, I can tell you that the whole vibe of the cd is the same as that song. Without going into each track, each song fits in with the mood of the cd. It is not one of those cd's where you find a one hit wonder and that's it. I'm surprised that more released singles did not come from, ""Over The Line"", because all of the songs are good. You will want to listen to it more than just one time. For any collector of music, this is a rare find in the archives of 80's music. Greg Guidry has a great voice and it complements the quality and style of the song selections."
3,"These illustrations are OK, but...","This edition is ""OK,"" but I like the one illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman much much, more. For a complete multi-media experience, get the audio CD of the author reading and the DVD (or VHS).The Hyman-illustrated edition is hard to find, but worth it."
4,Quite good fun,"Good fun film. Some spectacular effects actually, but the plot let it down a bit. I still really enjoyed it, and has some good comedy in it."
5,Great movie,"this movie was great totally enjoyed, at first i was doubtful because of negative reaction from others who saw this movie but i'm glad i didn't listen to them and watched it for myself and totally loved this movie"
5,awesome in #=3d theater,"awesome srk movie, dont listen to other people who talk abt bad to ra one cuz they jalouse. i liked watchin it in 3d with the glasses :)"
3,"Good enough, but no more","A good-enough Bollywood/videogame/SF film which, unfortunately, never rises above being a well executed string of cliches. Not a waste of time to watch, but not something to seek out."
3,TOO SHORT!,"Well narrated overview of the great russian writer with an emphasis on the places he lived , they come alive as references are made with his various works. But after 20 minutes or so , you are left yearning for more. It comes up short and does not give this great writer his due."
2,Step mechanism breaks,The step mechanism broke after a couple of years of use. Expected it last longer. Also clogs and wastes a lot of space. I will look for a rectangular one now.
2,"Yup, our step mechanism is broken too, after trying to fix","The good:* Looks nice* Size is nice, larger than some others we've tried* Plastic bucket inside is nice, though would be better with a handle* Appears to be high quality on the outside, the finish, the pedal, etc.The bad:* Ours is broken too, after normal use* My roommate was able to reconnect the mechanism a couple times, but eventually it totally broke.Was very interesting to see other reviews mentioning that. Ironically, the broken mechanism was why we're looking for a new can."
1,THE WORST GARBAGE CAN EVER!!,"Do not under any situation buy this can, way too many problems with something that should be simple to use. One of the main problems is that for what genius reason there are sharp metal edges inside the can so every time you take out your bag of garbage-that's right the bag rips (EVERY TIME!!!) Another reason is a sanitary one before you remove each full garbage bag full of garbage you are forced to stick your hand in the garbage to remove the binding ring that holds the bag in place..disgusting! To ""simple"" things should be associated with a garbage can one is that it does not rip the bag and the other is not to have your hands in the garbage! If I could 0 stars I would!"
5,The Ultimate Acid Test,"You either get it or you don't....And if you don't get it, I don't want you at my party.I'm looking forward to Har Mar Superstar's next album, ""Can You Feel Me."""
1,Sucks in a major way,Dude is a pompous idiot. The only thing worse than listening to this LP is seeing his ugliness live. Only highlight for me is knowing that he has had a vasectomy (typical song subject). One talentless dweeb of his stature (or lack thereof) is more than the world can handle.
5,Great Text Book,I am a 20 year old college student and about a year ago I became interested in sleep science. I am busy taking my required classes so I got this book to learn the basics of sleep science and find out if its what I really want to persue. When I started studying this book I realized how much there is to know about the Science of sleep.Ive looked over several books at my main library and I found this one to be the best. I plan on spending 2 or 3 days on each fundamental (there are 22). I'll probably write another review when I finish it.
4,"good content, not so good presentation",great content but i was disapointed with the presentation. it seems to be a recording of a presentation of the speaker. nevertheless the content is very very good. i may had missed something but i was expecting more drama kind like a documentary like you see in the history chanel or something.
3,Good enough for the cost,"I bought these because they were cheap and they are single-pull -- the wire is on only one side. They lived up to those two requirements. The cord is a little too short. And it's not that loud even at the full volume. I think the volume control hurts the signal even when it's turned all the way up. Given all that, they're cheap and do the job."
1,Disappointed,"As a civil war history buff, this book was a little disappointing. The stories were not well written and the publisher overlooked some pretty bad grammar/spelling errors. I read about two of the stories and put it down and have no interest of picking it up again. There are definitely better books out there! Dont bother with this one."
1,This Phone Is Horrible!!!!,"I have had this phone for less than a year and have had nothing but problems with it since I've had it. First, it takes forever to answer. Then, it doesn't even charge right. So you put the phone on the charger overnight, thinking you'll be able to use it in the morning....but no such luck because it only charges when it feels like it. The base of my phone is completely useless. At this point I can't get my phone to charge at all. This was the worst money that I've ever spent. I might as well get a cup and some string to talk on!!!!"
2,Source for Image Entertainment DVD,"The Image Entertainment DVD uses a very old National Telefilm Associates 16mm television syndication print. This results in only a fair image quality and a poor, and often distorted, audio track."
1,This book presents much false information,"This is a well researched book by a well-known and knowledgable professor. However, the sources for his information are flawed and inaccurate."
1,Useless as a tool for investigation,"I have read this book and others like it. For the purpose of Christian-Baha'i dialogue, it leaves the Christian with no basis for logical, relevant or serious arguments. Anyone interested in investigating the Baha'i Faith or preparing for a discussion with a Baha'i will do much better to actually read the writings of the Faith."
1,BACK WAS BROKEN,"the back would not shut making it utterly useless for my class though the bag, lens and other items were in great condition"
3,"Great smell, short life","These cones smell soooo good! They don't smell exactly like coconut but come pretty close for an incense cone. I also purchased the strawberry cones and the smell is equally, if not more, pleasing. The cones themselves are taller and more slender than the standard cones I am used to using. They have such a short life, however. The smell barely starts spreading through the room before they are done. In addition, unless these are used in a small room, you really have to be right next to them to smell them."
5,Excellent CD - Loved every song,What a great CD! I listened to it over and over again.This is the first Train CD I have purchased...but it will not be my last.
3,Just Short of the Bottom...,"Like a too-short-rope for a rappelling fanatic, the Train ""My Private Nation"" CD inspires confidence to jump over the cliff until you come up about 20 feet too short. This album comes up short when compared with other Train albums.Pass it by. Enjoy something really good by Train. My Private Nation is not really good. It leans on songs available in other releases. Save your money and your CD player slots for something truly worthwhile."
2,Dissapointed,"There is not enough instructions for some of the projects. In one of the projects there is not even all the things to fill out the tree. On the Advent tree there are only 22 projects to put on the tree and there should be 24. Now the basket ideas are just beautiful and I am goin to try one today and see if I can master the project. I was glad to see your instructions on making fruit because some of the other books I have, say not to even try making some of the fruits because they have to be so thick that they do not work and they were wrong."
5,Every African from the Diaspora needs to watch this,"This video is wonderful! My daughters (6 & 2) watch this everyday, all day. It's very entertaining, and educational. It teaches that no matter your size you can make a difference. It shows that the African people are smart and wise and spiritual.I highly recommend this video for any person, particularly African-Americans, to show to their children. Remind them that we are a great people, not what America portrays us as and had turned us into."
4,Interesting Movie,"This movie is a great look at an African oral story. Be warned that it does stay true to the African theme and therefore has nudity. However, it is tastfully done and is not a distraction from the story line. The story follows the character Kirikou, a little boy who has miraculous powers, through his journey of growing up. The theme of the movie is one of forgiveness and mercy to those who may seem like enemies. Very well done."
2,I do not recommend it,"I have purchased the combo player a few months back thinking that I can play my home made Video CDs (VCD). Though the on tha packing it says we can play Super VCDs, I was not able to play. After spending hours to reach the customer suppoert, the CSR asked me what is a SVCD (duh).Another CSR asked to send the player for service. I did. Finally they returned the player with a note ""Unable to test"" and they did not returned my sample vcd also.I was so happy that I was able to return this.Features with VCR were ok.Think twice before making any decision."
5,Good cabinet.,"Everything arrived as specified. Very easy to put together and is nice looking. Overall, a very good buy."
4,pretty good so far,"all the pieces came intact and undamaged and it was easy to put together. the doors don't seem to fit perfectly, but i am still able to close them so it's not a huge deal. overall a good item"
1,Just Opinions,"I was very disapointed with this book. It's a large volume of just opinions. The profile is somewhat useful, about 20 pages of good stuff, but the rest could be trashed."
3,Unclear Picture Of Silverchair's 3 album run for Murmur,"This CD is all over the place, most best of's begin at the first hit/single then progress on to the newer stuff so you can hear the growth of a band, not only is this missing ""Shade"" (released as a single) it has Emotion Sickness on it sure its not a bad song but i don't ever recall it being a single, also this contains the album version of Tomorrow from Frogstomp, the original Tomorrow that was a hit can be found on the Tomorrow EP same goes for Anthem For The Year 2000 (the single mix is found on the Anthem For The Year 2000 Single, that is the version of the song that was the hit not the album version).If your new to Silverchair however and want to get into them this would be a good starting point before you progress onto the 2002 era music."
4,Not Ready for the Greatest Hits,"I was never really interested in purchasing Silverchair's cds, however when I saw the video and and heard Ana's song, Silvercahir became very appealing to me. I purchased the cd recently and I find it a little odd to have a greatest hits album after just 3 cds made. Overall the songs are very good: Freak and Tomorrow are some of my favorites. Some songs could use some help like Trash and the Punk song. Daniel Jones has a very fragile, vibrant voice with good vocal variations which is what makes this album good. Some of the lyrics could also be a little too easy such as Anthem of 2000. I respect Daniel for his sucess at such an early age and I hop e he will continue to make more albums with even better aspects. This album is great for people who wants to a feel of how Silverchair musisc is like."
3,"Easy, quick read","This is a quick, easy read. It's an ok book - pick it up at the library, but don't pay for it. Crazy For You is better."
3,Nothing Special,"I love a good Jennifer Crusie book, mostly her newer stuff. However, I just couldn't get into this book like some of her others. The plot was ok, but nothing special. Far from my favorite Crusie book, but it wasn't horrible. At least at only just over 200 pages it didn't take up a lot of time. I'd rather recommend Bet Me, Anyone But You, Welcome to Tempation or Faking It."
3,Good but not great...,"I must say: What is it with Jennifer Cruise and all of this blinking? and Pot Stickers? By the end of reading the fourth book my eyes itched and I was hungry for Chinese.I must admit that although I did enjoy this book it wasn't terrific. The plot was ok - it had great potential - but it just didn't cut it.A friend of Charlie's dad, Bill, asked Charlie to come to work undercover at his radio station and see why he's gotten an anonymous letter saying that something illegal was happening at the station. So Charlie jumped on board and came to the rescue. His first day there he runs into Allie - who just happens to be slated to be his producer - and they hit it off. He immediately drops his hotel and moves in with her.It's not a bad book but I guess by the time I got through the 4th Jennifer Cruise book in less than a week I'd read more sentences about blinking that I was getting a bit annoyed. So I'd say it's a definite read - just don't read her books one right after the other..."
2,must have for gamers and lover of the dragonlance series,"If you enjoyed the dragonlance saga this is a must have for your collection. It is a wonderful book with tons of information on the world of Krynn, misc. facts on races, and the heroes. It is a must have for any fan."
3,FREESTYLE,"This was a really fresh and interesting film. Plus the fact that I love London, I really enjoyed the cast as well as the story line."
3,Not quite 4 stars for me.,"I downloaded When Darkness Falls (Jack Swyteck) by James Grippando in three parts as free downloads and that made it a great bargain. Having said that I would give it a 3-3.5 stars. To read it in three parts may have made it a little more difficult to follow, it did make me want to continue on to parts 2 and three. Most of the other reviews will give you the story line so I won't bore you with more of the same here. I like the premise of the story although at times I was a bit confused as to who was the main focus of the story, the detective or the lawyer. So I can only give it 3 to 3.5 stars."
1,Horrible transfers,"Absolutely the worst transfers of old records I have ever heard. Full of digital gimmicks and tinkering, this is terrible. This is a total abomination of wonderful music. I rated one star because I had to. It doesn't even rate a star."
2,"Stick to ""Baby Songs I""","I bought this video because my 18 month old daughter enjoys the first ""Baby Songs"" video so much. This one was a real disappointment. The songs are neither catchy nor entertaining. I doubt it will get nearly as much viewing at our house as the other video has."
2,Fine if it hadn't broke,"I had the volume knob problem. It's too bad because I got really good reception with it. I have a small screwdriver that I try to turn it up and down with, but I can't be sure that it's turning off anymore because it doesn't click."
2,Long and Boring,"I guess people wants to see this movie for different reasons, I'll try to analyse this movie according to what I expect viewers are looking for and try to dissuade you from seeing it. There is nothing in this movie where you can't find in another with more bells and whistles and fun.[1] If you're looking for hot arousing sex scenes, forget about it.[2] If you're trying to explore / understand the psyche of middle aged men, forget about it too. All you'd see is this divorced Professor of Philosophy in his 40s/50s being obsessed about a girl half his age, ringing the girl at all times, tracing her phone numbers, and being confused why he likes the dull boring girl so much. Interesting, but you might wonder if you really need to spend 2 hours to examine the issues?"
4,A little bit of fun for the very young set,"This was a gift for my 2 year old grandson. He finds it almost too easy, so I would suggest giving it to even younger children. It is good for interactive visual reading activity."
5,Good dress socks for winter,"I was actually trying to order the same gold toe over the calf product I bought before, which are lighter weight than these. However, these are probably better for winter anyhow-heavier weight. They are a bit long for me, but I have short legs and it's not a problem anyhow. I have worn all three in the package (once so far) and they appear to be consistent quality. They stay up, and though they are snug, that's not a negative for me. Assuming they hold up in wear, I give them a five stars."
4,Works,"I lived in an apartment that had a ceiling fan that did not have a way to turn off the light without turning off the fan. We installed this and were able to control the light independently of the fan. It worked great for two years, and I would imagine it still works well now. The only downside is that neither piece is small, so if you're using it on the ceiling, don't expect the light to fit in a globe anymore."
4,Enigmatic King for Turbulent Times,"If the French Revolution is a gulf yawning between the Ancien Regime and the truly modern world, then few kings could have embodied that disjunction better than Louis XVIII. Born in 1755, he lived to see his brother and sister-in-law, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, guillotined by extreme revolutionaries; the Corsican general Napoleon Bonaparte seize the throne and declare himself emperor; and his country welcome him back after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. Bitter memories of his brother's ignominious death encouraged him to steer a course between reactionaries and revolutionaries. Although Louis has often been dismissed as a non-entity, Mansel's eminently readable biography presents a more balanced portrait of this enigmatic survivor."
5,Super!,"For an old guy like me this stuff helps get the blood pumping. A very well put together album with all good listenable tunes, no duds."
5,gypsy groove,"i love it, play it, it makes me get happyand like to share it with othersmakes you want to get up and dance just mooove arounnnndddddcc"
1,Who Speaks French?,"I recently ordered this book and was surprised when I recived it to find that it is TOTALLY IN FRENCH! (ALL 2400 PLUS PAGES) It appeared to have a wealth of information ( and of courses many thousands of names), but I had to return it. It would be nice if the web site indicated what language the books are written in."
4,classic,"A must watch. I have watched it at least 20 times. Whitney is phenomenal, beautiful and clean! If your snowed in this is a good movie."
3,With a cold eye...,"Clayson's tone throughout all these biographies was very off putting to me. He seems to see everything through a jaundiced lens. I don't know, it just left me, a big Beatle fan... cold. He also writes the longest sentences I've ever seen. There is plenty of information you've probably never read before, but you'll have to put up with Clayson's tedious writing style. I ended up just paging through the index. I do have to admit, he did alot of research. It's definitely got some gems. That's why I gave it three stars."
3,Sweaty feet.....,"I like the socks and have been wearing them for the last week or so, but one thing I have noticed is that my feet seem to be sweating. I typically don't have sweaty feet but these socks don't seem to let my feet breath as much regular cotton socks. I'm not sure if these are 100% cotton or not but they seem to have a higher elastic/stretch material in them than other socks I have had in the past."
1,"Warning - if you purchase this product, you will not be satisfied","Up until this purchase I have been completely satisfied with every single gold toe product I have ever purchased. I would only wear gold toe socks. I cannot fathom that the owners of Gold Toe would destroy their brand by producing this product. They are the worst socks I have ever purchased, do not buy this product!"
2,Ehhhh,"The concept of this book was enough to get my attention in the bookstore, however attempting to read it was too much of a trial. It drags in spots and while the author had some great ideas she never seems to have fully fleshed them out which made the book boring and tedious."
4,Grim reminder,This camp tour guide from decades ago is very interesting. It would be a useful tool to take on a tour of the current facility to see how things may have changed.
3,I Love Losers- after you get to know em' that is,"Nenad Bach's I Love Losers grows on you. The first time listening I thought ""What did I just order?"" However, listening mostly to ""American"" sounds I wasn't used to Croatian sounds. The ensemble/back-ups, however, made me want to listen again- very pristine. As I continued to listen his accent became less severe, and the music pleasent to my ""American"" ear."
3,Could have been better,"This 8"" bracelet is 7.8"" in length. And this 3mm wide bracelet is under 3mm, approximately 2.85mm in width. This shaving of size to save a little cost in gold is not an honest way of transacting a sale. A $75 gold bracelet should be the full length of 8"" and width of 3mm as described. I may return it or purchase a larger clasp. The one that came with it was diminutive in the extreme. But for this price I shouldn't have to."
5,Outstanding Book! Highly Recommended!,"I just finished this book, and I really enjoyed it. Steve Cohen packed a lot of practical information and keen insights into an easy to read format. The book is full of tools and tips that any reader can incorporate into their daily life to improve charisma and communication skills, regardless of profession. Of course, some of the tools take more practice than others. I'll definitely be referring to it again. Outstanding book!"
4,One of the better foreign language texts,I too found this book to be excellent. There is indeed a lot presented and as with any language it is important to master the materiel prior to moving forward. This text was also selected as the German 101 & 102 text package for McGill University of Montreal.
4,A Cross-over Story that Works,"Most stories that involve someone from 'Real Life' going to another world, having adventures there, and coming back are not very good; some are downright awful. This book, the final book of the trilogy involving Steve ""the Dreamer"" Wilkinson, manages to succeed where so many others have failed.Both worlds are convincing and compelling. Steve is not some ultimate weapon -- rather, it is what he knows as much as his wits and courage that lead him on against the forces that are arrayed against him.I recommend this book, but also recommend that you read the first two books of the trilogy first, as this is not a stand-alone book."
3,Superspeedway,"I have HD at home.Just an average DVD.Worth watching for the DVD itself maybe 2-3 timesWorth showing HD clarity to friends.However,I have HD channels. This movie is available many times on the inHD channel. So usually I just use that."
3,A good ride!,"It's now kind of old, but it was a great IMAX movie. Popped it in and it just puts you in the race car at full speed. you can feel the engine rev on every turn."
5,Home Theater must have,"If you own a home theater or are a race fan this is a must have very interesting, the only disappointment is it's not 2.35:1Picture quality 5 Sound quality 5"
4,Video quality could be better.,"My comments are mainly on the video quality, or lack of it. Because it's a DVD it looks much better than video tape. However it is the first DVD I've seen (of 30 or so) that has visible compression artifacts. While most of the video is sharp, there are some glaring problems in spots. For example, in a long shot of the track, the cars in the distance look like they're emerging from a fog. It's a disappointing IMAX transfer consider the very high quality of the source material. I watched the DVD on a 100 inch high definition projector. These problems will probably not be noticeable on a 30"" regular (NTSC) television.As for the movie itself, the sountrack is great, the pacing is a little off (what's with the barnyard animals?), and the technical details covered were interesting. A real ""you are there"" experience."
1,boring,most boring movie everI don't know why I bought this - couldn't get through it - not even ok for playing guitar along - too silly.
5,I loved this movie,"Very real. Very personal. And very true to ""adult"", read 40 year old plus, love and intimacy."
4,Friends Music is Classic,The Friends of Distinction really broadend the Pop music market in the late sixties and early seventies. Their soulful rhythems & upbeat tempo set the standard for crossover music in that period. This collection contains some of their very best work.
4,A pretty good all-around primer,"The term ""working director"" refers to the type of director who gets hired for various movies and TV shows, instead of just picking his projects wherever he wants like Speilberg or Cameron. This book doesn't contain much information on the ""art"" of directing. Instead it tends to focus on the business of it, and that's exactly what makes it enjoyable. Tips on how to not piss off the producer who may be in charge of hiring you for your next job, how to earn the cast and crew's confidence and loyalty, and what will be expected of you on set are what makes it unique.On the down side the book really only slightly dips into any given topic, more ""quik tips"" then any real in depth advice. But at least that makes it a fun, fast moving read."
4,better than high school,"When you read any piece of non-fiction, especially historical, it's all too easy to find yourself reading a thousand page list of names and dates. Madden has included the names and dates, but hasn't forgotten the story.Additionally i know it must be hard to find that perfect balance of just right and too much information. We may have gotten a little shy of just right here. i guess that may be better than drudging through a thousand pages of what the non-history major may consider to be boring details."
5,Beautiful!,"We bought this at a local winery when it caught my eye. It's very unique, it's so pretty and really fun to use when drinking port with your friends. Everyone loves it when we pull it out and we receive compliments each time. It is delicate and has to be handled carefully, definitely not something to be played around with, but it's intended for adult use and for sipping so it's really not a problem. It makes a great gift too!"
4,Cool,"This was a gift for my friend. The quality is not the best, but it works fine and the price is right. When I talk about the quality, I mean the packaging is very cheap and kind of dirty looking (smudges on packaging) and the glass pieces themselves had imperfections like bubbles. Never the less, price it right, I'm satisfied."
3,good 3 stars,"in some stores here they present the cd as something like radiohead to sell it. There is a resemblance (more with Muse: ""so shine sunshine""), but their music is simpler and without any violence. Anyway it sounds good.Well i hope you're not sick of the voices of Tom Yorke and Matthew Bellamy...and look at the sethpage's review!"
2,"Good songs, bad recording quality","The CD has a fine selection of songs, but unfortunately, the quality of the recordings is not very good. Some of the pieces are fine, but most of them have an irritating, high-pitched background sound that makes the CD difficult to enjoy. This is not ordinary static. I'm not sure whether the distortion came from the original recordings or is an artifact of the remastering."
3,A bit too folksy,I enjoy older travel books with a lot of history and places that don't make it into more modern books. This was fair for my interest.
4,Great Book!,"I really enjoy everything that Nicholas Evans has written, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I couldn't put this one down.I've also purchased this book for several men that I know that love to read and they have enjoyed it also."
2,Big Disappointment,"One of the most predictable books ever written. This love triangle is nothing new in today's fiction. Every page was predictable. I wouldn't waste your time with this one. I was very, very disappointed."
1,3 hours I can never get back,"This book was just plain bad. I rolled my eyes and made scoffing noise throughout and don't know why I bothered to finish it. I would have had a more entertaining time picking ticks off a dog.From Chapter I, the ending was predictable and annoyingly so. The characters were bland except where a modicum of depth was imposed for the sake of continuing a boring story line. Everyone was oh, so amazing, perfect, talented, and wonderful, or tormented or beautiful and unaware of it. Yuk!And, there were approximately four story lines at once that seemed to have little connection until the end. I'd pass on this one. Try a Harlequin Romance; there's more mystery, action/adventure, sex, and storyline."
3,Guilty pleasure,"This book was fun to read, but I was disappointed. It was predictable, and at times .... I enjoyed the beginning of the book, but the rest felt like a what-are-they-doing now sort of special. I also felt like the characters were cliche and not that realistic. It was a nice summer read, but not one of the best books I've ever read. I also thought this book could use a better title. If you're more interested in the smoke jumping aspect - which only the first part of the book was really about - read Young Men and Fire."
5,Masterful Use of Traumatic Events to Develop Plot and Character,"This book has everything I love in a story: slightly dangerous occupations (my writing regularly features EMS and military characters). War and chaos. A handsome, brooding male character. A love triangle ... and a happy ending (I'm a sucker for those). Evans did a masterful job of using traumatic events and showing how the characters develop because of (or in spite of) them. The 'voice' of each was authentic and even though there were four points of view (telling their stories) I didn't have any moments of confusion like I have in other books. The only weakness: the purpose of the moose-on-fire imagery was unclear to me, other than a vague notion of significance."
1,What are you people smoking?,"The Truman Show was an absolutely unoriginal, poorly presented product of Entertainment Tonight style all glitz no substance horse manure.I'm serious. I bet horse manure would make for better viewing. I'm going to go film a couple hours of it, and then see if I can get the Hollywood machine to hype it up as an ""Oscar contender"".The Story - Crap.Jim Carrey's Performance - Average."
3,A MOVIE WORTH SEEING FOR THE CONCEPT ALONE,"Jim Carey makes a definite leap out of his usual genre. The concept of this movie is staggering. Although some spots dragged and the ending left much to be desired, the concept in addition to Carey's amazing performance makes it a hit! Even better the second time around. You notice more of everyone's quirks the second time!"
1,This is a dumb movie,"I hate this movie. I hate the plot, the concept is really stupid, and the ending is not a suspenseful cliffhanger but a mere cut out of nowhere. The director is obviously trying to suck as much money out of the public as possible because this is definetly a sequel ending. I give it ten thumbs down!!!"
2,Truman ain't all that!,"When I found out Jim Carrey was devastated upon hearing the news he was not nominated for an oscar for his performance in ""Truman"", i wondered what all his fuss was about. Gee Jim, whatcha gonna do now, run off and kill yourself? Get over it and stop pouting, your performance wasn't that great and to make matters worse the entire movie was certainly not worthy of any oscar recognition in my opinion. Fact of the matter is, ""Truman Show"" is a mediocre film about a man being watched by millions of onlookers. Well let me tell ya, this onlooker would have changed the channel, okay!"
3,Blu-Ray Truman Show,"Blu-ray is weird to watch. Very strange indeed with all the little imperfections standing out, very documentary like with some elements of pre-reality TV days like a soap opera. Watched on a PS3PlayStation 3 250 GB"
2,"Wait for the ""collectors"" edition?","I saw this at the show (in the theatre for you outside the midwest) and loved it - I usually dislike Jim C but here he shines cause he *under* plays his role (hard to believe huh). HOWEVER, it's been said before here - I just wanted to add my vote: except for 2 trailers there is NO additional material - this obviously was *rushed* to DVD (I'm afraid we'll be dealing with this from now on). Also the ""widescreen"" isn't 1.85:1 - it's just narrow black bars at the edges of the screen, and there are some obvious cut-offs (half-faces, etc). If you ""must"" own this get a pre-viewed VHS and save some $$$."
5,Creative and very ingenious.,Andrew M. Niccol creates yet another unique movie (since Gattaca)that shows his immense talent in movie making. Jim Carey does an excellent job drawing us to Truman Burbank's world and forces you to imagine yourself in his situation.
5,truman show,such a great movie. saw it years ago and it still holds its own. the cast and writing was right on!....LOVED IT!
1,BORING!!,"Actually, 1 star is too high a rating to give this movie. It was just plain boring! And stupid. Most people go to the movies to escape the reality of day to day life, if even for just an hour or two. When I saw it, I thought there was going to be something spectacular and interesting about this man and his life. But there is nothing. He gets up in the morning, goes to work, stops at the same news stand, then goes home. What is so spectacular and interesting about that? He doesn't even do anything funny that can justify the $3 I had to pay to rent this movie. I feel bad for those who spent $7.50 or more to see this in the theater."
2,This is a COMEDY?????,"I didn't find this the least bit funny, especially after Princess Diana's tragic death. The media does hound people to death, and it ain't an ingredient for fun, folks. The callousness of the Truman Show's ""cast"" is appalling - (...) - and Truman's ""something isn't right here"" is endlessly dragged out. The ending is especially unsatisfying - what does Truman do next, do these jerks get away with what they did, does he have a ""normal"" life after this, are all left unanswered. Waaay to long as well. At least twenty minutes of this flick could and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Instead of feeling entertained when it's over, the viewer feels like one of the voyeurs who exploited Truman. Jim Carrey fans should rent ""Ace Ventura"" instead."
1,it was sweet,i loved it it made my stomach feel better while vomiting i think it was crappy to say the least it was kind of eerie if you think about it
3,Case damaged.,Came on time but the case was damaged. Not terrible just a hole in the front but still wasn't expecting it.
1,Did Denise Austin star on Saturday Night Live (SNL) or what?,"Denise Austin's constant babble, babble, and more babble (i.e., burn that butter! Yeah! Yeah!) and SNL mannerism are similar to a kickboxing parody on a late night show. I did not know when to workout or just sit and laugh. I eventually decided to donate this to my local library because I couldn't concentrate even in the slightest. Also, the fitness crew in the video are a bit annoying to watch. There are too many people in a small area and their performance and effort are disappointing (making them look participatory in this ""parody""). The title could be changed to ""Denise Austin's Power Jumping Jacks"" because of the excessive usage of jumping jacks over kicks. I actually went to the market to buy Kathy Smith's Kickboxing tape but it sold out and in desparation I decided to buy this. Pass on this tape and save your money, unless you would like to watch a kickboxing parady then this is the one for you."
2,UGGGG,I like exercise videos and am in generally good shape...I didn't like this video at all. Denise Austin moves too fast and assumes that everyone can keep up. It will give you a workout if you don't throw your back out in the process. I have other Denise Austin tapes that I like...but this one is not one I'd recommend.
3,"Good workout, but...","To put it bluntly, Denise has what they call ""diarrhea of the mouth."" She talks CONSTANTLY!!! It's not even as if she's saying anything useful, she just babbles nonsensically. She also doesn't cue well, even confusing her poor background dancers at times.It's still a great workout (if both sections are done back-to-back) but her yap-yap-yapping makes me want to send a nice hard front-kick into my TV set! So I do recommend this tape, but if you wanna keep your sanity you'd better do it with the sound off and the radio on."
3,"""The Man From T.R.E.K.""?","I mean, is this a prequel Trek novel or a copycat ""Man From U.N.C.L.E."" adventure? I can almost hear Robert Lansing's clipped Sergeant Friday wannabe tones in Gary Seven's dialogue. The period cliches seem forced: Patty Hearst, ""Crocodile Rock"", the ""primitive"" 747. The depiction of Roberta Lincoln further along in her training as a recruit ""agent"" (even though Gary should have also trained her to use that bimbo soprano voice to make people underestimate her). The massive underground high-tech lab with labyrinthyine hallways tailor-made for Solo and Illya to chase the bad guys down (or be chased down by the bad guys)--why don't they appear here? Okay okay--I realize there had to be a 20th century environment in which to set Khan's childhood, but did Cox have to drag in heroes from one of Trek Mark One's clunkier ""aw-come-on"" episodes?"
1,Uhhhh,Meshuggah's name and Bury Your Dead shouldn't even be in the same sentence together. Meshuggah was advancing metal while these guys were still in grade school.
5,Accidental stumble on pure gold!,"I was just in my local album shop when this album dropped and they had a bunch of copies for like $7 bucks bcuz they were irregular and had a hole punched on the bar code. I saw they were on Victory Records and listened to it while I was there. (The record label means everything to me on my choices on what to buy.) I couldn't believe how badass it was. It gave me goosebumps. I initially picked it up bcuz of the cover. Lol. But if you like hardcore music, go pay the money and buy this record. I couldn't take this album out for like 6 months. I turned countless friends onto this album. It is a diamond in the rough. I accidentally found it and was hooked. I hate downloading, so support the bands and spend the money. Vicious album. Mat Bruso brings the heat with the whole album. Try their latest ""Mosh n Roll"" too. Badass."
1,The new age of mallcore,"Wannabe tough guy vocals, repetitive guitars, weak drums, and flaccid lyrics deppreciate a rather overrated band. Avoid."
2,I've Already Heard This Before,"This CD isn't super terrible, but I can't detect any originality in it. I thought this would be yet another Hatebreed clone. I have to be correct for most of the tracks, but ""Magnolia"" sounds different than the rest. I would advise you to download a track from these guys (you can't buy it online yet) and let someone else buy the album."
2,WIsh I had gotten differnt color,"THe quality of the fabric is very good, if not excellent, but we are not thrilled with the pattern and color. It is not easy to select the background separate from the subject matter, which was important to us. A more solid background might be better."
3,Product was as described.,"The color on this background is rich but the background is thin. I had to put my white muslin behind it to keep from seeing through it. However, the background was just as described on Amazon. I can't really complain because it was a good background for the price."
3,This is a pretty item,"that I got because I have a hard time with heavy mixing bowls. It looks really nice and went through the dishwasher just fine. But seeing a 1.5 qt size is different from imagining one. It is smaller than I think I need, but may be good since we are only two in the house these days. The other thing I want to mention is that it is made in China...which is not stated in the item description, and that might be a big factor in some buyers' decisions for any number of reasons."
1,got a bad one,"If it worked perfectly, I would like it. However, it arrived slightly damaged (I used super glue instead of going through the return process) and that worked just fine. But now, after just two weeks of having it on my desk and using it approximately 8 hrs/day, the bulb is flashing in and out (I'm assuming to tell me it needs to be replaced). I should have returned it from the start."
5,put together with care,"I appreciate guide books that are put together with care, appreciate writing that is fun and interesting and highly informative. ""Fodor's Costa Rica 2004"" is an inexpensive book and a terrific one!It was the best book on the country besides the considerably more pricey, ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made,"" a welcome addition to any library collection that will capture the interest of travelers, amateur geologists, students, and conservationists ."
2,not satisfied...,"Packaging is good...at least using the envelop. However, the item has a broken case. I always received broken/damaged package of the unit.... so disappointed...For the movie, a 3-7seconds part has a blurred / distorted images (Moose and his GF were dancing in the street)..."
4,Hip Hop at its best,Although this CD is not true to the movie music - it is pretty close. If you like hip hop sound and tempo - this CD will entertain you.
3,decent movie,"It was fine. I like the first 2 better, however it was a decent movie and I would suggest getting it."
3,Not as good as the others...,"I have watched the movies backward, which means i started with this one http://amzn.to/YR5Xxu which is the latest movie of the step up movies. Step up 3 has compared with the other a really flat story. The dancers and the choreographies are great and have a lot of stunning moves implemented. If you like the other movies you will like this one to. It is really worth to watch it."
4,If you love dancing and comedy see this movie!!!!,"I thought there was alot of amazing dancing than the other moviesand I'm glad that the story changes in every movie because it would havebeen boring with the same characters over and over....but some characters from the last movie return too.Theres alot of dancing in this movie for sure,love romance too,and some comedy If this fits what you like to seein a movie rent or own today!!!Great Movie!!!Amazing dancing too!!!"
3,awesome movie in 3D,I really enjoyed and i never thought this movie would be good but it was and i got this movie for my wife because she loves dancing so she loved but i like its its good.
5,Great Movie,I am a big fan of all the Step Up movies and this one did not disappoint! Great story line and lots of great and talented dancers.
4,Universal remote,"This remote was a direct replacement for the remote that came with our television. It worked perfectly, and easily switches back and forth to control both the TV and the satellite dish."
4,Starter Book for Senior Writing Class,"This book provides a format of simply asking questions and providing half a page for a response. Good memory joggers for Seniors who wish to write longer memoirs for their family. The authors were born in a younger generation and some queries did not even apply to us when we were at that age: ex: 19-25 - ""Did you ever have a bad experience with drugs?"" The pre-depression generation didn't even know of drugs when they were in that age range. It is still a good starting place but I assure you there are some questions that I am NOT going to answer. An older author would have posed different scenarios."
2,A Meager Attempt,"As good an author that Mowthorpe is, he blew it on this book.There are at least 38 errors in the story, though someare just typos. Never the less, it appears the man didn'tdo his homework. Most of the information is redundant andhas been written about many times, in past books.The only sections that are reliable are the chapters dealingwith British Airships.Let's hope a revised edition will correct the obvious errors."
2,terrible copy of a classic,"I've only seen this great performance available on VHS back in the '80's, so I jumped at the chance to buy it here on DVD. This dvd will not work in every player. When it arrived I popped it in my Denon dvd player and it could not read the formatting, so I put it into a cheaper player in the spare bedroom and it played.What I saw and heard was disturbing to say the least. The picture and sound quality was horrible. In addition to this, every song begins with about 10 seconds of video that is not in sync with the soundtrack. The sellers/copiers also took the liberty of adding cheap visual effects that were not in the original VHS performance.If you are a die hard fan of Aerosmith and you must own this on dvd no matter what, go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for a clear picture and sound to accompany this hard to find concert, don't waste your money."
1,dvd texas jam 78,"Could not view the product on dvd player, customer service at FANPORTS said rudely that it was a dutch version and it stated it on the website. I couldn't find that on the AMAZON WEBSITE. i LOVE BUYING FROM AMAZON BUT WOULD NEVER BUY FROM FANPORTS.COM, the customer service was so rude and i am still awaiting credit o 1/15/11. purchased as a christmas gift in dec. picture on website doesnt match what i expected to receive."
5,Very good book,Good reading. Will keep u reading. I would recommend this book. Patricia Ryan is a good author. I did enjoy this book.
5,The complete edition,"This is the PLUS edition of Stand Alone Complex original soundtrack 1. The 17th track included. It's Get 9 (TV Size)! The theme music of broadcast-by-NTV version. Of course, Yoko Kanno composed the wonderful musics."
1,cable modem,"I am very disappointed in this purchase. It was represented on the site to be DOCSIS 2.0 certified, yet when purchased for my mentally challenged client, the ISP looked up manufacturers documentation and the modem was only 1.0 compliant. I am now out $20.00 including shipping and no workable modem. Disappointed client and caregiver. Will never buy from this seller again. Contacted seller for refund and was told it was my responsibility to ensure compliance and did not listen when informed site said was 2.0 not 1.0. May stop Amazon shopping altogether."
5,Gardner's Latest Demonstration of Universal Interest,"Gardner is amazing! Each of his collections of essays is a marvel. This volume consists of ten essays and nineteen book reviews or introductions on a stunning variety of topics.Gardner is known as a mathematical puzzler and a sceptic and debunker of pseudo-science. He is also a philosopher and literary scholar of impressive breadth and depth. This book exhibits depth of analysis on a stunning array of topics, from Christian Science to The Wizard of Oz.Highly recommended, but if you are new to Gardner anthologies, his collection, The Night is Large, is a better introduction to his breadth of thought."
4,nail drill,"I recieved my nail drill a couple days ago, on time, and exactly what I wanted...comes with few instructions on the basics of using it though."
5,MUST READ,"This is nothing but pure excellence. Refuting common misconceptions about Buddha, the origin of Martial Arts and the amazing (yet, barely revealed) role of Afrikans, this book IS AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT for the student of Afrikan history. This book deserves an infinite number of stars. Five stars just doesn't cut it..."
4,so far so good,"the package is similar to the one I order before which does not last long. less than 1 yr. the original battery last about 3 years. when it is good, it is good. just died too fast. I will see how long this one last."
1,Don't waste your money,I hate this game there is only one screen to shoot things & when you shoot everything you start over on the same screen shooting the same products. Very very boring don't waste your money the Wii Play game in the shooting sections is 100 times better. I thought I'd like this game because it's fun to shoot a targets & this one sucks.
1,Boring - don't buy,"We got this game in a bundle with the Wii system. Within 5 minutes you are bored. Don't bother buying it. If you really want it, go to a used game store and pay less. I think that is where I am going to take mine!"
5,Great movie-gets you thinking-could the lights really be aliens,I loved that the movie was based on an actual event. It lends the movie credibility which very few Sci-fi/horror films have. It's a must see for all sci-fi/horror movie fans.
3,Amazingly Poor Figures,"This book is well written, covers a wide breadth of information well, and is a valuable reference. It is also has clear, interesting writing. That said, the quality of the typeface, and especially the figures, is so incredibly poor as to render the book painful to read. I can hardly belive how badly executed a modern (1995, 2nd Ed.) volume by a large publisher (Prentice Hall) can be."
2,Cooks too hot !,"This crockpot cooked much hotter than my last crockpot, so I am unable to use it as it burns my dinners prior to my arriving home. I need to cook dinners for at least 8 hours, and this one was just too fast for me to use, so I purchased another one that works better for me."
4,Inspector Lynley,Ms. George is a great author. The Inspector Lynley series is my favorite. London and England is described in every little detail.This mystery keeps you on your toes. There could be so many murders. I love the interaction of the characters. I intend to read every series of Inspector Lynley.
1,Could barely finish it.....,"Elizabeth George has outdone herself in creating totally unlikeable characters and a side story that makes you sick to read about it, that was skipped over by me in the process of trying to get to the end of this monstrosity of a story. The only reason I finished this book was because I had decided to read the entire Inspector Lynley series in the order published. Otherwise, I would have deep-sixed this book when Olivia started telling her story. This book is on the same sub-par as George's ""What Came Before He Shot Her."" I usually love reading Elizabeth George's mysteries, but this tale was too much to handle and I do NOT recommend it to anyone who has any sensitivities to mistreatment of animals or dislike for subhuman behavior."
2,Not up to this author's usual standards,"I love Elizabeth George's Lynley / Havers series, but this particular novel has been a huge disappointment. The characters are so unappealing that you don't care wha happens to them at the end. The plot - or rather, a weird jumble of unconnected bits and pieces that pass for a plot - is very boring. A large chunk of the novel is narrated by a character who is so pompous that it is painful to read her endless musings about nothing.The good news, though, is that this is probably the weakest book in the series. So pick up any other novel by George and you will be in for a real treat."
1,The drums gotta' go......,"I found the drums to be most annoying. I just purchased it and wished there was a way of muting the drums. Impossible to mute though as you really need to pay close attention to her quick instruction of moves and her transition from one move to another was too fast and left me with little time to do all the reps or doing them the wrong way.I was disappointed as I thought the whole workout would have been solely pilates but she incorporates ballet, aerobics, etc. which I'm not interested in. When I purchase a Pilate workout, I want a Pilate workout.I absolutely love Denise Austin's Pilates Mat Workout Tape. Her soothing voice and instruction are exactly what I'm looking for. Not someone ""barking"" out instruction with the beating of annoying drums in the background.I will take this workout on as a challenge but only because I hate to waste the money I spent on it unless I can sell it to someone."
2,Not my favorite Pilates DVD - and not the full 60 minutes!,"I work out a lot, and have a lot of at home DVD's, and I don't think this one is as good of a work out. It's also not a full 60 minutes as it claims - they spend a few minutes for each 15 minute segment doing breathing or stretches, and even with that it's only 55 minutes."
4,Great video for firming,I recently bought this video and the first time I did it I was feeling sore muscles that I never knew I had. It is working great for firming up and becoming more flexible. Sometimes I bring my VCR to work with me when my boss is out of the office and I can do a 15 minute segment or the whole tape if I have time. Target Stores sells this for 6.99
2,Not for beginners and simply awful drum music,"I was disappointed with this video. There is no emphasis on form or Pilates' philosophy. The women in the video are super flexible and are able to contort their bodies in ways that would be impossible for 99.99% of the population. It is fascinating to see, but difficult to follow, since they don't show you what the movements would look like when done by someone with normal flexibility. I would imagine that trying to copy these women (ie, laying your shin flat across your chest) could lead to injury. Also, the music, which consisted of 4 drum beats repeated over and over and over, was like an excruciating torture. Whatever were they thinking of?"
4,A Must Have!,"Before I tried this DVD, I used to swear by ""Pick Your Spot Pilates"" because there were 3 10 minute segments that targeted specific body parts and it worked really well. The Method Pilates is my new favorite workout DVD. This one has 4 15 minute segments dedicated to specific body parts and it also incorporates weights in one segment, which I really, really liked! The only part I didn't like was the incorporation of ballet into the ""Hips"" section. I'm fairly flexible and I consider myself coordinated but a lot of the ballet moves were pretty tricky. Overall, I highly recommend this DVD if you're looking for a nice tuneup."
3,The Method Precision toning & Sculpting is a much better buy.,"I bought this DVD because I liked the Precision Toning & Sculpting video alot. I liked the fact this one was divided into several target specific 15min workouts. However there is an awful lot of ballet in some of the workouts, which I am not graceful enough for! I was hoping to have more floor exercises. I do really like the ""Abs"" workout, especially if you are short on time but want a really effective workout. It has many of my favorite abs exercises from the Precision Toning & Sculpting video but at a much faster and more efficient rate. I also think they could have come up with better music. The funky tribal drum beat gets old real quick! Silence would've been better."
5,GREAT CHAIN LENGTHENER!,"This is just what I've been looking for. This is a great chain lengthener....so us short people can reach our fans! :)It's bright and blends in with all bright, shiny brass fans and their standard pull chains. A real must for anyone who has a fan that they use a lot and need to reach on a daily or frequent basis. (I bought mine for my kitchen fan.)"
1,rusts inside immediately at weld points - not safe,"Dangerous products need their own rating. One star is too good.The smallish cup rusted at the four points where the legs are welded to the outside, but the rust is INSIDE the cup, at the bottom where the batter rests. This happened immediately after the initial rinse. All I used was water. It's being returned, of course."
1,Not the product shown,"I have ordered severel of these, but this topped the list of the worst. I bought it because of all the good reviews1. Not the one as shown, but a cheap knock of.2. Spring on handle didn't work from the beginning, so I did not bounce back and the batter was just free flowing all over.3. When closed as much as swivel at the bottom, it was leaking too much.I use to have one (I paid only $10) and it had a little silicone half ring at the bottom, so that it would close to tight, it would hold water.But I have not been ale to find that since.I can not recommend you to buy this one. IT IS NOT A KUCHENPROFI AND NEVER WASWaste of money."
1,Don't Bother,"I purchased this book thinking it would provide a detailed insight into the business strategies of Sun and how Scott McNealy thinks business. As it turns out McNealey was never even interviewed for this book. It is filled with nothing but second hand accounts of the things McNealey did as told by people who worked for him years ago. The book has a logical order to the chapters but each chapter, chronologically, jumps all over the place. The author interviews everyone from Mcnealey's right hand man to the cleaning people and a variety of other folks that the reader does not care about. It is as if the author started cold calling people in Silicone Valley and if they ever worked for Sun she would interview them. I would not waste money on this book."
4,A must for High Tech job seekers,"High Noon provided me with the knowledge base needed to attempt a break out of the service industry and into High Tech. With the pages consistently answering questions and providing a knowledge base, the reader is able to develop the vocabulary and confidence to talk to those hiring managers. Southwick has solved the inevitable parable; ""I dont know what it is I don't know."" This reader is now a capable, confident, job seeker, and has ""talked the talk"" through two interviews at SUN Microsystems."
3,"Good, just very dated","After recently taking on some professional responsibility for a large Solaris farm after a long hiatus (about a decade) from Sun technology, I thought this might catch me up with the company and products. It did provide some good info, but this work is over four years old, an eternity in technology. It certainly did not reflect Sun's rapid decline in market cap and Linux debacles, both of which landed it on the front page of the WSJ a few weeks ago.I might have rated this four stars a few years ago. The only qualms are that the author should have presumed a more technical, computer-literate audience, and the audio quality was inferior (I listened to the unabridged Audible version)."
2,Thin,"If you were on a desert island from 1982 to 1999, this book might have extra value to you. Otherwise, you may already know a great deal about what's covered in this book.""High Noon"" is quite readable but doesn't dig very deep. It provides a good, albeit Pollyanna-ish introduction to Sun's history and to McNealy...up until 1999. Did I learn anything? Yes, for example, I hadn't known that Gosling architected NeWS. But the level of this book isn't that much deeper than a Reader's Digest article.If you don't know much about Sun's pre-2000 past and want a quick survey, ""High Noon"" may help you."
2,oh god,"Fred Astair is AMAZING: drummer, dancer singer. Leslie Caron hits her marks. But oh god, the Roland Petit dream ballets, one after another...I mean, where do you go when they start? the loo? The movie dies with the 3rd one: at that point who cares whether Fred gets to ""marry"" his ""daughter""?God-awful dream ballet stuff sinks this movie, but Astair plays drums, sings and dances in first hour. This is historical record."
2,"I'm a big Fred Astaire fan, but...","This is the first Fred Astaire movie that I've ever quit watching midway through. It's really more of a showcase for Leslie Caron, who was sort of a French Annette Funicello -- although she's likeable enough, her personality and talents seem singularly underwhelming, especially when you've got Astaire waiting in the wings, twiddling his thumbs. The film starts out great, with a scene of Fred banging away on the drums, keeping time to a jazz record and talking hep lingo... But it loses oompf midway through, and Astaire recedes into the background for far too long. It's an okay movie, but there are many, many better films to be seen."
5,This is a great book for a writing arsenal.,"I've been so inspired by this book--Having a hard time getting through it because I keep stopping the reading to write. If you're a writer and need inspiration on character development and subtexts, this is a must-read."
2,this is season 2 in disquise,Recieved this and was surprised to find that it is the same as my mythbusters season 2. same episodes different packaging. Which made me look at all my season and ive found that season 3 has the same episodes plus some.
1,"Could be great, but ... is not.","It's great at the beginning, but sooner or later, the scroll-down function will literally die. There is no non-destructive way to clean the ball to restore its function."
3,Too small for my hands,"I love when both form and function are rated high. Though beautiful, i get cramps because it's too small.The track ball, however, is great."
1,Don't Buy,"Do not buy this mouse. I have been through two now and the scroll button has stopped working. Read the reviews on the internet, many, many people have problems with the scroll button. If we don't buy, perhaps Apple will go back to making a quality product."
3,loses connection easily due to cheap switch,"the 2D scroll wheel is great. however, apple really needs to get over the whole one-button thing.also, the switch that keeps the mouse turned on is a flimsy metal tab inside the battery housing. mine has a tendency to release pressure on the on switch, causing my mouse to mysteriously lose connection. hours of fun trying to troubleshoot that one! thanks apple."
5,Great mouse - I love you,"The BlueTooth Mighty Mouse is a WONDERFUL improvement over the original Mighty Mouse and clearly, the best bluetooth mouse available for Mac."
1,"nice shape, but...","The mouse is cute, fancy and I really like it at first. But after using it for a while, I found it is really not good.The right click is 'OK', if you can remember to lift your index finger when you want to have a right click using your middle finger.The tracking is not good. I got some troubles when edit photos in Photoshop and playing WOW.The scroll ball is terrible. It worked perfectly for the first 4 months, then got troubles everyday.Finally I have to give it up and switch to a Logitech G5."
3,good for transportation,"nice mouse. looks great. designed incredibly. but I don't recommend it for every day use, since it's shape doesn't fit your hand. see Logitech mouses. they fit your hand so you will not become tiered of using it.the other thin is, the clicking sound. it looks like the early mouses when you click it sounds CHLICK ;)another thing is that if you see Logithech mouses they are less FRICTION than this mouse.the only pros I see in this product is that it's design helps you put it in the Brenthaven bags."
1,Scamed a kid jerks,"When my mouse came i was so happy. Then I hooked it up and guess what, the right click did not work. If they would send a replacement I will be happy. Thankyou."
1,Do not waste your money,The wireless mouse that I purchased is remarkably unreliable - one hour it works and the next it does not. A very frustrating experience.
2,Stick to a real mouse,"I got this mouse with my new Mac. It's uncomfortable, and it seems quite a bit larger than the Logitech mouse I normally use. Right-clicking is a matter of luck with this mouse, about 25% of the time it won't recogize a right-click no matter how you position your finger.The squeeze feature is awkward, and the side buttons require quite a bit of force to activate. You won't be just clicking one with your thumb alone as might seem natural, you *must* have a finger on the other side of the mouse to counteract the pressure.The battery door on the wireless version is pretty flimsy and will pop open just about anytime you try to turn the mouse off.It's not the worst mouse in the world, but it certainly isn't a great one. Mostly it's just gimmick-y."
4,"It's here, finally!","this mouse is the new bluetooth mouse from apple. Released july, 25 2006 this is the same mighty mouse from apple but without the cable. Perfect from my new black macbook.What is good: bluetooth, two botton apple mouse, scroll for all sides, apple desing.What is bad: price; you can't recharge the batteries using the mouse (like RadTech BT500)."
4,does the job,"As the Product Title states, ""Easy Fit"" Mud Guard...seems to have both the necessary strength and the flexibility to trim out the moulding and stay put. The included wide rim screws are helpful (think there's 4 per flap) but I used a combination of rivets and the screws. Thought the rivets would hold better on the plastic trim. Could be useful to have a steel stabilizer bar as wheel wells are seldom flat...to span a one inch recess, I mounted an angle bracket and riveted the flap to it."
5,Easy to carry and not too cramped,"Looked at a few different Tamrac bags and settled on this one. It has plenty of room for my Nikon D80, 50mm, 18-200, Speedlight SB-600, and all the extra cards and batteries. Even with all this in there it is not cramped and has a little room to spare. Though don't let this lead you to think the bag is huge. It's not a bag you'd buy for a compact camera, but it's size makes it easy to sling over your shoulder and feel like it doesn't get in your way or is too heavy.Pros: Comfortable to carry, good size for the body and a couple lenses, well priced, quality brand, offer some room to increase what you bring with you.Cons: May be too large for those wishing to just carry the SLR body and a single lens."
4,Good looking bag at great price,"I was looking for a lighter weight bag for days I don't want to carry my entire backpack. I first purchased the Lowepro Nova 170AW, and while the features and size were great, I couldn't help but feel like I had an insulated lunch cooler around my shoulder. The Tamrac looks inconspicous and is a great size for comfortably carrying my big Canon 50D with lens on, a couple of additional lenses, flash, filters, etc.CONS: Wish the strap attached via swivels instead of being sewed directly to the bag as I foresee the strap twisting getting annoying (and it DOES twist). The top flap attached by one buckle is the only thing keeping the gear in the bag. This is great for easy access, but it would be nice if there was an option to zip the compartment shut for added safety. Also, I wouldn't feel overly comfortable if I was caught in the rain with this bag, as the sides of the flap are somewhat exposed.Overall, a good looking bag that will see plenty of use from me."
4,Big but good for the big DSLR camera and accessories,"The bag looked huge when I first got it. I was use to carrying my little Canon digital camera that was the size of my palm. I bought it for my new Nikon D80 and the Nikon SB600 speedlight external flash. Fits both perfectly. The zoom lense I have is the 18-135mm, which is little longer than the other kit lense 18-55mm. The bag is actually deep enough for a longer lense. I still have room on one side of the bag for an extra lense or another accessory. Yes, the bag is big but look how big the typical digital slr camera is. The front compartment is great for keeping extra battery, charger, lense cleaner, basically every camera parts I own. The bag is used more for storage than taking on day trips. For day trips where I don't need the external flash, I use one of the small Tamrac bags that holds just the camera (it's actually shaped like the digital slr camera)."
1,poor,"this was the worst to put together, the numbered parts were so hard to read I had to buy a magnifying glass to even remotely read the numbers.Iwould not reccomend this product."
2,Marginally worse than the second one,"While I am not familiar with the universe this is based on, I enjoyed the first one thoroughly. This book is marginally worse than the second one. While the second one started okay and went downhill, this one starts at the bottom and digs. The charachters are hollow, the plot uninteresting and poorly executed, and it nearly abandons everything done in the first book."
5,Powerful Reminder for Women,"This book was amazing! I can't believe it took reading this book for me to remember that I have needs too! I spend most of my time running around with my young son, running to work, running home and trying to keep up the house, etc...It would not have even occurred to me to do something for myself and here is someone who is giving me permission and telling me I will be a better Mom, Partner and Employee if I self-nurture..I realize that I need to think about my own needs and figure out what they are. So for now I signed up for a writing class one night a week. It's a start and already I feel better. Thanks."
3,"Like a Smart, But Boring, First Date","Mr. Martin's obvious love of academic research is put to wonderful use in bringing the venerable history of Harvard to life, and through his protagonist, one may also enjoy discovering the particulars of the rare book business, such as the lurking danger posed by ""blue mold.""However, the real mystery for this reader was how the author managed to render even the standard thriller must-haves such as murder and sex un-utterably dull.Overall, the book is a genuinely good effort, but if this were a first date, I'd leave it at that."
5,a fun read,i really enjoy his writing...i love that he goes back into history and then brings it to the future....so interesting and entertaining...history buffs will enjoy his books...
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,Headphones are comfortable enough and the product fit and finish quality seems to be OK but I found that if my head moved I lost contact. I had to position myself to get the signal and stay in one spot. The frequency selection is the real problem. The tiny dial is way too sensitive to accurately tune in and stay there. The interesting part was that I could listen in on other peoples phone conversations even though I'm at least 500 meters from the nearest house. Bargain basement electronic quality at best. Might be appropriate for youngsters when the parents want a little quiet but they too would soon protest. Back to the store they went.
3,Nice scent but it fades fast,"I really like the scent and for the price you get what you pay for. You have to spray a lot on and the smell fades...oh and FYI I'm not a guy that takes cologne bathes. I also wear Aqua Di Gio and Echo and I only use 2 to 3 sprays of those when I use them, I have to use 5-6 sprays of this stuff and my GF says it still fades away."
5,Exactly what I expected,My husband loves this cologne but it has been very difficult to find. I was concerned that it might smell different - but it was exactly what I expected. He loves it and so do I.
5,HEI SMELLS GREAT !,"I never get tired of the clean smell. It lasts and lasts.Hei is my ""goto"" scent!!"
3,FAIR,I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE WEAK ON SMELL. I USE THIS ALL THE TIME AND THE SCENT IS VERY WEEK. DOES NOT HAVE THE STRONG SCENT AS MY OLD STUFF. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SETTING ON A SHELF A LONG TIME OR GOT TO HOT OR COLD IN STORAGE. THANKS DOUG
2,Not right,"When I ordered PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR2 667 MD1024SD2-667 I GOT THE PACKAGE OPENED IT, THE INVOICE SAID PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR2 667 BUT WHAT I FOUND WAS ANOTHER BRAND. i SENT A E-MAIL THREW AMAZON TO VENDER. i GOT A REPLY, THEY RAN OUT OF THE PNY BRAND AND SENT ME A BETTER BRAND.I CAN'T TELL YOU IF IT IS BETTER OR NOT ALL I DO KNOW IS IT WASN'T WHAT WAS ORDERED AND EVEN THE INVOICE THAT WAS IN THE BOX HAD THE PNY OPTIMA WHICH DIDN'T MATCH WHAT WAS IN THE BOX"
1,Textbook Review,"The textbook I received was in very bad shape even though the condition said ""excellent"" shape. I paid $93 dollars for what I thought was supposed to be a nice used book when it was terrible. I am very disappointed."
1,No Table of Contents,I downloaded the sample and discovered that the table of contents does not work making it extremely difficult to navigate this large volume of classical work. I would suggest you wait till there is a version that has a working TOC.
3,Network cam,Hard to set-up. I has to be restated frequently to keep the web access working. Local access works pretty reliably.
5,Works great - We have three of them!,"These camera's work great. No PC needed. Even if the internet goes down, the camera will automatically re-connect...Web interface works fine even when viewing on an IPhone.Not cheap, but worth every penny - we have both wired and wireless and both work fine..."
2,BEWARE,owned ours about 3/4 years & this past year all kinds of problems. I also own a 1994 rca that runs like a dream.
1,Only for Sinatra Lovers!,A total waste of time an money for this DVD. It doesn't even have the Can-Can song in it! Save your money on this one and watch your TV for an hour with it turned off.
4,Get It Now!,"Very insightful and reader friendly, full of fascinating insights on the structure and even the true evolutionary function of the eye. It helps to put to rest the myth of bad eyesight being inevitable due to nature's ""design flaw"" in the eye. Best of all, it all makes such perfect sense! I have been trying some of the exercises, and I do admit my vision and its ability to focus becoming a bit sharper than before. It's great, get it now!"
1,The eye exercises,"The ""new program"" is the Bates travesty in the new, tawdry, commercial clothes. As if the superficial brochure was not enough, the authors developed also a video version - with a comfortable price margin. Be a fool, if you like it."
5,Another Image Works master piece,"Like the other national parks dvd's by Image Works, these beautiful dvd's with wonderful music and no narration are the best I've ever seen. A+++++"
5,Everything you hoped it could be,"I agree with the previous reviews. This DVD release is fantastic. If you are like me and want to know if the shows are complete, yes they are. Is the original video tape used, yes it is. Is the sound mono sound used, yes, along with optional surround. The only thing that stops this from being perfect is the second show. For some reason an out take is incorporated into the show while a Liza song that aired was deleated and added to the disc after the show. But don't let that stop you. Buy It!"
4,A solid piece of work from Messrs. Wilson and Costello,"Mirage tells the story of Julie Gordon, a research scientist who, by means of virtual reality, has made great inroads into mapping human memory. Julie is forced by circumstances to delve into the memory of her twin sister Samantha, who is in a coma as a result of a mysterious bomb blast. Julie's trek into her sister's mind brings her closer to understanding both her estranged sister and the truth about a tragic event from their childhood. Messrs. Wilson and Costello deliver a solid piece of work, which will please fans of both authors."
2,Too Gen-x for its own good,"Although the book held my interest, it seems that Hornberg was more interested in trying to shock us with his characters' outlandish behaviors and attitudes than anything. I am squarely in the age group of the characters in the book, and consider myself pretty in touch with what's going on, but I don't relate to these characters at all. They are essentially stereotypes of the slacker gen-x generation, which is much more fable than reality. In short - the story is too far out there to be realistic, and not far enough to allow me to suspend my disbelief."
5,one of the best books i've read yet!,"the book entrapped me and i read it in one night, then my friends saw it and i ended up lending it to about 15 diffrent people who all loved it, and who all finished it in a day because they couldn't put it down. I had an english teacher read the first three pages to the class because of how well written it was. She read it to the class talking about the desciption, etc. (She didn't know what bongwater was.) I can relate and I loved how at the end it wasn't ""they lived happily ever after"" You know they have a story that goes on, I think it brings more life to the characters. They weren't amazing people, they weren't even entirely buetiful, they were just people. I could relate to the entire book, and I had lost hope that I could find a book like that. So congratulations to Michael Hornburg for being real and writing about normal life."
2,meh...,the entire book seemed like it should have only been one chapter of a longer book. i saw no point or any sort of conclusion to the story.
3,~*Ashleys Review*~,I just got done reading Magic Lessons last night & I have to say that I am a bit disappointed! It's not as good as the first & it was hard for me to keep up with. It only started getting interesting when Reason found out that she was pregnant. Anyways I'm ordering the 3rd book now & hopefully it will be better than the 2nd one.
1,Disappointing for sure,"The tape recorder did a poor job with picking up sound. The sound on the microcassette recorder was muffled and didn't do a good job picking sounds in a classroom, especially if the speaker is using a microphone. If you are looking for a top of the line recorder, I strongly recommend going with Sony"
3,expected something different,"I was looking at different books to get ideas on designs for glassware to paint. After reading the reviews for this book, I was really excited to get it. Ordered it on a Saturday and got it on Monday. Wow ! I of course flip through the pages the first time....excitement turned to disappointment. I expected more designs than what was shown. I have now taken the time to sit down and read it, which does give me helpful hints. I am a novice to this, and wanted some ideas for gifts and possibly selling some work. So this book wasn't quite what I wanted."
3,good introduction - poor examples,"The book provides a good starting point to learn Microsoft .NET, especially if you would like to implement applications using patterns approach. However the book does give you a feeling of good read that it was hurried, and the examples really does not adress the challenges you will face in real .NET projects. I should've picked up the electronic version of the book available free at Microsoft rather than buying this book."
5,Revenge...is a dish best served cold.,Brutal and graphic. The origin of Lady Snowblood and the horrors she suffers made this character into a killing machine of vengeance. One of the best vengeance type samurai movie ever made. This is the way a revenge movie should be made. It's no wonder this movie helped inspire Quinton Tarantino's Kill Bill. Watch it and see why
5,"When did ""Liberal"" become a bad word?","There is nothing wrong with being liberal. Being liberal means putting people above political dogma no matter which country it is in.There is nothing sneaky about Rosenblatt's prose. His poetic style carries his ideas across clearly and with grace.What suprises me is that people are actually threatened by this book. How absurd! It is a wonderful book and a joy to read.But hey, maybe everyone who didn't like this book can burn it along with ""Catcher in the Rye""."
5,Excellent,"Very good product. Well designed and well built. Easy to use. I've seen some complaints that the broom swivels, so I was a bit concerned. No problem at all. yes, it swivels to make it easy to get under edges or to sweep into the pan from any angle. Works very well, smart design. I certainly recommend."
3,Butler Stand -up Dust Pan/Broom,"This is cheaply made.It is suppose to stay open so without bending it can be emptied,but it is hard to put it in that position,so you end up putting your hand on the dust pan.Butler,or whoever makes it ,needs to improve the quality."
3,Dustpan is fine; broom not so much ...,"I purchased this to replace a similar set that got lost in a move. I need a small broom and dustpan for quick clean-ups around the house, and since I have back problems, this design usually helps. I'm fairly tall (5'9""), and the dustpan's handle is OK for my height -- not perfect (it needs to be a bit longer), but OK.The dustpan part of this seems to be fine -- it hugs the floor tightly enough that I can get stuff into it with just a couple of sweeps.Which brings me to the broom. Whose bright idea was it to make this thing swivel up and down? It defeats the whole purpose of keeping the broom head secure against the floor. it takes at least twice as much work to do any real sweeping with this.I've given up, and now use another broom with this dustpan, and that's working much better."
3,Broom/dustpan bought from Amazon,"I like the broom, but have a very hard time sweeping into the dust pan. I doesn't stay flat on the floor so the dirt being swept goes under the dust pan."
5,"Great CD, love the music!!","This is a great CD. Music from my childhood. My parents use to have old 78rpm records from this time and they would play them when I was growing up. The music just grows on you after a while. I think they got the records they played where from the juke boxes from the old restraunts and bars up on the iron range in northen Minnesota. Anyway, this CD is well produced with words to the music and some great history. I'm going to visit my 86 year old mom this weekend and plan to bring the CD and see what she thinks...."
5,GRACE PG-GREAT PERFORMING MACHINE,"The ESPRESSIONE GRACE machine produced in Italy is awesome beyond words. It produces a rich, hot, espresso coffee with exceptional crema both with the filter basket for ground coffee AND with pods.There is a powerhouse of plentiful dry steam which is perfect for creating lattes and cappuccinos.I checking out the machine, I learned that it's produced by Grimac, who enjoys a wealth of knowledge with more than thirty years of experience in the coffee sector. We liked the metallic body machine with it's semi-commercial quality components. Can easily produce many continuous espressos and cappuccinos... ESE adaptable for use with ground coffee or coffee servings (pods) which we purchased the ESPRESSIONE coffee pods from amazon.com.Go for this machine. If gives the performance of a much more expensive machine at a price below the price it's being sold at!"
3,Duplicate reviews,I would be highly skeptical of many of these reviews... they all seem to be lifted from the ad copy and/or written using the same vocabulary...
3,"Great player, just not my taste","Peck is amazing, one of the most perfect orchestral flutists of all time. As a soloist, he is just not one of my favorites. He tends to play sharp (which was surprising considering his massive CSO career) and seems to just play the notes, albeit perfectly. I'd so much rather hear Mr. Peck ""go for it"" sometimes and perhaps, yikes!, even miss. Considering who Don Peck is, a critique like this one seems a little bit like, I don't know, criticizing a sunrise or something else equally awesome... Anyway, give me Baker, Mariano or Nyfenger any day of the week."
5,This product worked for my toddler children!,"I gave this product to my toddlers for occasional constipation. I must admit this product worked wonders and helped my toddlers create a bowel movement when they are constipation. I would recommend this to people, family, and friends if they have children, grandchildren, nieces, or nephews with occasional constipation. It really works!K.B.- Salt Lake City, UT"
5,The Cure D'Ars,"I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Jean-Marie-Baptiste Vianney.What an amazing priest this man was. This book is a detailed biography of his life. At 628 pages it is quite long but well worth the read. The book contains many examples of the deeds he performed during his life and these are backed up with references in the text and footnotes from eye witness testimonies. The book also contains quite a few photographs.It is amazing how he was able to achieve so much from so little. He worked for all but 3 hours a day to fulfil his priestly duties. He habitually fasted barely eating enough to allow survival and mortified himself, on behalf of his penitents, throughout his priestly life. The book also details how he was tormented by the devil for much of his life as a priest and also details the visitations of the Blessed virgin Mary and St. Philomena.I am sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did."
5,Excellent 'shield for Elite 250!,"I picked this up last winter for my '86 Honda Elite 250. It was easy to mount-probably 15-30 minutes, no drilling or cutting needed-the instruction sheet is a little vague, look online for some pictures and you can figure it out. It's big enough to give good coverage and it extends to the sides to provide some hand shielding as well. The orange running lights make the edges of the plexi glow at night, which looks kinda cool. Nice quality plastic and fasteners. I thought I would take it off after the winter but now I find that I like riding with a 'screen all the time. I think that makes me an old man ;-)"
5,See below,"I have read about 50 Emily Loring books and they are all clean and fun to read. I would like to find a complete list of her books and complete my collection, preferably soft cover, but will consider hard cover. June Kibler"
1,Missleading title,"This book was way to vague to help me in getting started. I would classify it as more of an ""about the industry"" book than a book that deals with the creative process. Admittedly, I am not a book writer but isn't that what this book is designed for? The publishing companies section is very outdated. Wasted my money on this one as an impulse buy in the store. Learned my lesson, Always read the reviews!"
4,A new final fantasy alright....,The good thing is the characters creations. You can change their faces body type spieces and when u get a new job and armor it show wat ur wearin unlike most FF's Yet that still has it down side. u have to pay $.77 a month for each chara u have. the map is huge which is good. its got a lot of stuff like ff tactics [jobs job abilities]. this game is a combo of fft w/jobs ff9 w/the way the map is and boat/airship things +an online pay. there virtually no lag and the most stable system. i recommend if u get get it for PC. its awsome how u can trade items make alliances and craftin weapons w/ others. the quests and missions are ok some are borin some are good and some not even worth it But $10 a month can be bad if u got a pay n u got no money. you do get a short free trial. if you get the game get the guide it helps a lot more then the manual i give Final Fantasy XI an 8 out of 10
2,Don't waste your time.,"Really. This game is dead. Go buy World of Warcraft or EQ2. Even with the latest ""expansion pack,"" the game isn't that fun and doesn't offer a lot of innovation."
3,"Lots of fun, but costs lots of money","The game is great but I thought someone should tell potential buyers the only way play this game is to pay 12+ dollars each month, so unless you are ready to pay $40 for the game and $180 a year to play perhaps you shouldn't purchase this game."
1,yep,"ok look, you people are complaining that you didnt know that you had to have a geForce card...and that the manufactures should tell it on the box, well it does ok, look on the internet, sheesh. Shopping stupidely is one way to get a bad game experiance. I havent played this game, I am unlike you guys, trying it out before buying it. You complain about the pixelated graphics, get a better video card noob. You also say its dull and boring like all other final fantasies...well if you dont like the other ones why try this one? Then complain. Just keep your mouths shut and deal with your stupidity losses, because their your fault."
2,fun for a while,My son was very excited and loved this when we first got it. By the end of the day both arrows had split in half and now it sits without being used. It would be nice if they had more durable arrows that came with it or extras that you can purchase. This was not abnormal use that caused them to break.
3,"Good product, poor pump.",I use the salmon oil to maintain a healthy skin and coat on my dogs. I was disappointed that the pump did not work (would not open)making it difficult to give the correct amount of the salmon oil.
5,Good Product,This oil helped my dogs skin and coat. Recommend it for any dog with minor itching or coat problems.
3,Strong Smell,"I do not know if this works or not, I cannot get my dogs to consume it. The smell is very strong despite mixing with their food and I guess they are spoiled since they eat everything else. It may be better for cats but did not work well for me."
2,Dogs refuse to eat it,"I don't know what it is - my two yorkies love fish, but don't want anything to do with this oil, or any food with this oil on it. Also the oil easily gets on their hair and spreads, leaving a long term fish smell."
5,"Great price, great product.","If you have a dog with special allergies/reactions like I do, you're constantly looking for the miracle product to make a positive difference. Is this the holy grail to fix all maladies? No, probably not ... but it has proven to be a significant piece of our boxer's health puzzle.By using this oil along with some probiotic pills, we've made a nice impact on her gastrointestinal reactions, her coat health, and her allergy-related itching. The pump makes it a lot less messy than cutting open the fish oil gel caps like we initially tried. The bottle lasts for a long time (we keep ours in the fridge) and the price is fantastic.Tip: Start out with just one pump at each meal ... your dog may have a ""special"" reaction like ours if you try too much, too early."
5,Makes the dogs happy.,My dogs love the Salmon Oil added to their food. It's much healthier than adding canned food to their Kibbles. The 32 oz bottle goes a long way with 3 dogs.
4,Be careful ordering this during winter months!,"I ordered this for my terrier mix small dog, and unfortunately it was the week of the first really cold spell in ND. The product arrived frozen and the bottle was cracked. Amazon immediately refunded my money, which was great. I was able to salvage about half the bottle and pour it into another container, and use it on my dog's food. While I have not seen a reduction in his dry skin yet, the oil seems to help satisfy his appetite. He no longer begs for food several times a day and is content with his morning bowl of dry food with the oil on it. I have since found this product locally and will buy it in the store to avoid the freezing issue, and will post an update in a few months on whether it has helped my dog's dry itchy skin. Even if it doesn't help his skin, it's worth it for the appetite control properties (maybe I should try it on MY cereal in the morning)."
2,Works; but nearly useuless.,"I can't say this phone didn't work; it does. but once you go into ""contacts"" you cannot dial a phone # directly w/o going back into skype itself and changing tabs in the software. Which; when using the buttons on the phone to navigate, locked up one me a few times.If all you do is call skype contacts; then it's probably OK; but if you're like me who calls a lot of other #'s -- it's near useless.I returned this phone and went back to my $9.50 skype phone which works a heck of a lot better - feels better in my hand too."
3,Always a page turner,"Desmond Bagley was a very solid adventure genre writer. His skill was to deal with the common man in extraordinary situations and to discuss the heroism of the ordinary man.In Wyatt's Hurricane, we meet Wyatt, a man who studies hurricanes and happens to live on a small island called San Fernandez. Hurricane Mabel is in the area but according to historical data, the island will be spared from the wrath of Mabel.Which is fortunate as the island's dictator is fighting of a coup from a rebel army.Wyatt senses that the hurricane is going to change course and decimate the island. Can he and his small team of people caught up in the coup survive? Can Wyatt convince the armies to stop fighting and go to high ground thereby saving their lives and the island's population?The book is an easy read, Bagley being a master storyteller can weave his magic and keep you reading. I might nit-pick over his dialogue which always comes off as a bit wooden but in the end, the story is the thing."
4,Great for the price,"The Froth au Lait is a fabulous product for the price. The froth is pretty remarkable, and it works best with soy milk or nonfat milk (as recommended). The only downsides that I can share are that the product itself is quite large and not very beautiful (it looks especially ugly next to my stainless Francis Francis espresso machine and Kitchen Aid coffee grinder) and that you need a bottle brush to clean it. I have already bought two as gifts for coffee-fiend family members. I previously had a $90 machine (aerocino?) that worked half as well and for a tiny quantity of milk, so I am quite pleased overall."
1,Not worth it,It's basically a blender with a screen attachment that beats the milk. It heats up the milk and beats it a bit. There is not a lot of froth. I was very disappointed. Nothing like what was shown on the box.
4,"Great Froth, cleaning is not great","The froth is great though it seems to generate about 1.5 servings worth at the full mark. I would settle from less air in the froth if I could get more steamed milk out of it. Like some other reviewers are saying, the thing can be a pain to clean because some of the milk does burn.I'd probably buy it again."
2,Adequate,I purchased this item after reading a review that said it produced a thick froth. I was hoping for a heaping frothy product. However after using various types of milk and half and half I found that I get a heated milk with a slight amount of froth on the bottom. I would say this is adequate for heating milk but the steam frothers that are attached to the expresso makers are much better. I would not recommend if you want a thick froth. If you just want warm milk with a little froth it is okay.
3,works but way too hard to clean,"This machine works well -- almost too well. My quibbles are: 1) the foam is so stiff it's like a whole other substance, i.e. solid froth (not exactly what one wants in coffee); 2) the machine itself is unnecessarily large and takes up too much counter space, and 3) MOSTLY, it's way too difficult and time consuming to properly clean. If you can afford to cough up another $50, and are intending to use this for lattes and cappucinos, I would highly recommend the Nespresso Aeroccino Plus. I bought it because I was so disappointed with the Froth Au Lait for the above reasons that I was willing to invest in an entirely different product and trust me, it is totally worth it -- great foam but not so stiff, works in a fraction of the time, and cleanup is a breeze. I am putting away my Froth Au Lait."
2,bulky and not good for small portions,"This machine is quite bulky so takes up lots of counter or shelf space (think wide blender). Also while it frothes/heats well it is too large for small portions -- if you use half a cup of milk for one/two cups of coffee, most of the milk/froth ends up splashed on the walls/sides so pretty wasteful.Finally, NOTE THAT THIS COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOW RETURNS on kitchen appliances -- so i'm now stuck with the thing!"
1,Serious design flaw,"The Good:This unit does what its suppose to do, froth milk.The Bad:The removable center whipping mechanism can't be cleaned on the inside shaft. The milk touches this part every time. That part of the shaft sinks in the milk and bacteria could build up. I suppose you could try to clean it with some Q-Tips as it is too narrow to fit anything else in there. I would return it but I bought it as a package with a Nespresso machine. I've used it 3 times now before I realized this. Needless to say, I won't be using it again.Edit:I now have an Aerocinno frother. A lot easier to clean up and it looks good on the counter, unlike this thing where you have to hide it. It's hideous."
5,LOVE MY FROTHER!,"This is the greatest frother I have tried, and I have tried a few! Makes great thick froth perfect for yor drink, and the best part is that it is also HOT! If you are looking for a frother, look NO MORE!"
5,MAD ABOUT GOVI,"I admit right up front that I am crazy about Govi's music. There's not a bad cut in all of his CDs. And best of all, you simply cannot stay lazy and down listening to him. Keeps you light and upbeat without getting over the top hyper. Like I said, love this man's music."
4,A helpful insight -- personally AND academically,"I found this book to touch me as a person, while reaching me on an academic level at the same time. It is rare to find an ethnography that engages you as a reader, keeping your interest, that also gets the scientific point across. I found Dancing Skeletons to be one of these rare finds. It's an excellent source of information that also captures your attention on a personal level."
4,A good old fashion horror read,"This book is a quick and easy read for those fans of the good old fashion horror stories. Well paced, it holds your attention. Sometimes you wish the main character would wise up but for such a quick read it is written with a fresh style and doesn't ever really get boring. 4 stars..."
1,Why was this film made?,"I can only assume the producers had some spare film left over, thought they might as well use it up, squeeze a few extra coins out of the franchise. This is quite the worst excuse for a dinosaur film I can remember seeing. The early scenes, involving a lump of rubber which is supposed to be an armoured dinosaur, should be enough to put anyone off. If it isn't, then prepare to be bored. Though the plot starts off interestingly enough, combining Conan Doyle's characters with eco-awareness, it soon descends into a tedious copy of its predecessor, with a far-too-large cast stranded in the lost world. Virtually nothing happens for most of the film. The dinosaurs are barely seen, but as the special effects are so lamentably bad, maybe that's for the best. Once again, a well-cast Challenger and Summerlee are completely wasted."
3,Entertaining and suspenseful,"This movie had to grow on me for a while. I was at first put off by the shoddy voodoo practiced by the suburban grandmas, not to mention some of the gore. The acting and subtle eroticism save the movie from decending into an unwatchable mess.Parts are very reminescent of _Angel Heart_, and the end is a real kicker.And yes, Mark Hamill looks very, very good wearing only a pair of grey briefs."
3,Short of my expectations. A bit shallow but interesting....,"I had been really looking forward to the sequel of Sharra's Exile, and further novels written in the tradition of Heritage of Hastur. However I find the characterization, Marguerida's internal conflicts, search for identity and her confusion and irritation with her sudden telepathic powers a bit drawn out and stereotyped. It does not have the intensity of Heritage of Hastur or Sharra's Exile."
2,"milking a series, a plotline, a plot...","Having read every previous novel including Sword of Aldones (which, by the way, seems to me better than its replacement Sharra's Exile, I liked Dio's role in it), I heard tell of Exile's Song and thought ""wow! Great! More Darkover after all!"". I was disappointed. The only interesting element in this is the presence of the shadow matrix. Everything else was just rehashing the Ashara Is Revealed As An Amoral Manipulator plotline from ""Sharra's Exile"". Plus, I was really annoyed with the threshold sickness thing. How many times do we have to have this described? Although it's true that the characters don't know about threshold sickness, it would be nice to fans to give some variety to the disease. This nasty form was well done in ""heritage"" already. Let's have something new, for once: how about a terran who comes to darkover and is (gasp) NOT telepathic?"
3,Hasn't this been done before,"I've read a lot of the Darkover novels and this will probably be the last one. I actually love Margret Alton's character, which is why I give it 3 stars, but it just seems like I've already read about terrans coping with darkovan culture shock. And thank god MZB didn't go to far into that rununciet character, I'm so sick of the free amazons after reading Thendara House and City of Sorcery. It just seems like MZB is trying to keep the money machine rolling instead of bringing terra and darkover to some sort of ""head"" in their dealings. She should have some sort of war of PSI powers or at least get to the point after these dozens of novels which are costing me a fortune to read the same story over and over. If you love darkover definetly read this book, if your a casual fan quite reading them."
4,Fun reading for hanging on the couch with your honey!,"What a cute little book! My husband and I spent an afternoon on the couch reading this and ""I Love Her, But"" - we had a lot of laughs! Some of the insightful little blurbs about men and womens annoying habits can really hit close to home and can spark conversation filled with playful teasing! I'm planning to give this as an extra little wedding gift to a friend. I'm sure they'll enjoy it!"
1,All dried up,MY pot arrived all dried up. Some contents had even spilled down the outside of the pot and dried. It looks like it has been in this state for some time. I'm unable to use it unfortunately. As I live so far away its not worth sending back. Very disappointed :(
3,Nothing Unique,"I got this is brown. First, I want to note that there was weird glue on the jar and the glue melted (my bag was at my feet in the car and I guess the heater melted it) so now I have a messy jar. I'm wondering why there was glue there in the first place. I wasn't too pleased about this.The color is okay and it goes on nicely and looks great at first. I've always preferred brown eye liner over black because of the softer look. Unfortunately, this is too soft so I'm buying another in black. Not sure if I'll go with this brand again, though. I tend to get slightly oily and this doesn't last as long as I had hoped. I never rub my eye or touch my eyes throughout the day so I can only assume that it's rubbing off as I blink.Previously, I had used the MAC eye pot in blitz and glitter and that would stay on even after a shower. Anyway, I hope I have better luck with black."
5,Amazing!,"1st time i used it about 5 years ago. i didn't come back to this fragrance since then. I've ordered it now and i'm realizing that this smell is one those you are not tired of - it's fresh,wears out nicely a little sweet, and has a little bitter side. Not too heavy, not too strong, but still noticeable and very bold, recognizable, wears out nicely - after a long day you still smell it.For the price Amazon offered it is a must have."
5,Enlightening and Inspirational for Woman,"This movie, although, the title is kind of funky, is actually quite enlightening, interesting and fun to watch and inspirational to woman who may find themselves in this position. I thought the story laid out really well, the acting was excellent and the moral of the story strong and important. I've seen it several times and it is still interesting to watch again. Highly recommend it!"
2,Interesting,"Based on a true story, if you take it for that alone its interesting. However as far as entertainment, its your typical Lifetime made for TV movie. Production values and acting aren't the greatest.I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted it and admittedly, I was working on the computer while she had it running, so I didn't pay 100% attention to it.But then again, if it were better, it might have attracted my attention away from the computer... which it did not.However, ignore the bad acting and low budget feel of the movie and concentrate on the story itself, then you won't feel you wasted too much money."
5,"Good TV, better price!","(...) It had a good picture once you adjusted the bright. Sound quality is good. The folding makes it compact and the antenna in the strap really works, you just have to position yourself to get the best reception. (...)"
2,600mAh or 700mAh or 800mAh?,"Which is it? When I bought the Lenmar CBD366 via Amazon, it arrived in Lenmar packaging and was rated at 600mAh. The label on the CBD366 pictured here shows 700mAh, but the Lenmar site and specifications show 800mAh... The original 3SN-AA80-S-J1 battery was 800mAh. The 600mAh version rapidly discharges (dies) during conversations and soon looses the ability to hold a charge."
5,"Terrific TV, even after all these years.","I bought this television seven years ago, in 2001, for $1400. Though television technology has changed greatly since then, I still have chosen to keep this tv. It has a great picture, excellent sound, etc. Wonderful in every way (other than it's ridiculously heavy weight - once it's in place, just leave it there. . .forever)."
1,Boring hard to follow,"Atfer watching this movie, I couldn't follow what was going on. Who was who, who was having the flashbacks, where or when the flashbacks took place.I would rather watch an action packed Bob Ross painting show or Watch William F. Buckley Jr. give his observations than watch the movie."
2,almost like an asian version of waiting to exhale,this is a good asian movie having all the goods comedy being one of them which i enjoyed in the film but each performer did well in this the movie is a little long but it tells a story about each woman's past how they had their daughters and difficult it was from them when they were younger until the present how the grown up daughters face the same problems their moms had to face when in a relationship with a man not to sound racism or anything i was impress with some of the female actress speaking english very well the picture was clear as well i feel the movie should have won an award for best picture or at least have been nominated i guess they had to because the picture was very good for it being 1993
5,The Joy Luck Club (a movie review),"I was pleased with the product. The movie is a classic and can relate to all aspects of life. It is not only a 'chick flick', but I think a movie for all ages and likes of people. Perhaps reading the book would be an interesting treat to compare it with the film."
2,what a shame,"when i read the book as a little girl, i thought that it was wonderful...yet, some things should be marked ""handled with care"" when being made into movies....this movie was a HUGE disappointment. the actors themselves were wonderful, but they had little to work with....by skipping many parts and changing others, they've basically lost a big part of the book. it's gone from a touching reflection of the lives of chinese women to just plain cheap sensation. sure the story was ""touching enough"".....but WHAT a disappointment.but hey, what can i say? it was a long book. and some things are too complex for the 2-D movie screen."
2,peanut butter pie? LMAO!,"Wow, real immigrant Chinese gossip is SO much better than this. And the girls are skinnier and prettier too. This was so hamhanded looking it was like a grade schooler cutting out pictures in a magazine for a school project diorama. The pictures are professionally photographed but they have been transplanted to an unrealistic world. I don't know what this is other than contrast to Asian Chinese cinematic expertise. It didn't even have the hokey charm of the old timer accents of past Wayne Wang indie endeavors about San Francisco Chinese. Plus everyone is using giant plastic chopsticks which are really slippery and unattractive. The whole movie doesn't sound right, isn't dressed right. I have no idea what this movie has to do with Mother's Day but it does get aired around that time of year. It's one of those Minority Hollywood movies but this one and possibly ONLY this one made A Lot of money - like a A LOT."
1,"Thank you Amy Tan, for disparaging Asian men.","I had to stop watching this stupid movie half way.The movie was just so one-sided against Asian men.One man was an abusive gangster.The second one was the worst. He was bald, wore glasses and was so cheap that he pays his wife 7 times less than himself, and makes her buy ice-cream that she doesn't eat.I don't know what she has against Asian men. Maybe it's because she resents her father and brother for dying from brain cancer during her youth.This movie is even worse to Asian men then the Color Purple was to Black American men.By the way, Asian culture protrayed by Amy Tan is NOT typical of Chinese Americans. From what I remember from her biography, she spent most of her early life with her crazy mother in Europe, so she doesn't know anything."
5,One of my favorite films...,"I LOVE the joy luck club. It's one of those films that everyone can relate to. The divorcee, the overachiever, the immigrant child (myself), the disfunctional family, the difficult life experiences that changed you, the difficult relationships and sacrifices one had to make, the mother/daughter conflicts, the rivalries. It's truly wonderful to watch because it's so real.Often in films we see a fantasised version of things, everything has a fairy tale ending. In this film there are no fairy tale endings where everything falls into place nicely. This film is not like that. At the end, luckily, things improve for everyone when the family does become closer.I would say that it's a film everyone should have in their dvd collection."
3,Let down in the end,This was my first Jackie Collins book. I thought it moved quickly and I really enjoyed the characters. Take it from an avid reader; this story was really escalating until all of a sudden it's as if Ms. Collins just got tired of her own story. As you were expecting the climax of the plot it ended in a page; with a ridiculous epilogue of the demise of each character. ELEMENTARY!! It was an insult. I doubt I'll be reading another anytime soon!!
5,Loved It!,My husband took care of the kids for the day and a half that it took me to read this book. I could NOT put it down.
3,How can you not love Jerry Reed?,"He is a master of comedic country, and carry's a great tune to boot. So why only 3 stars? There are a lot of gems that should have been included, this CD was a long way from full."
2,Not comfortable,"I've owned a lot of doc martens in my life and I was really disappointed with this shoe. My toes were boxed in really tight and the back of the shoe was so rough and rigid that my heel was rubbed raw within an hour. If you're looking for a long term, comfortable shoe- this isn't it. I went back to my 5-eye padded collar and haven't looked back."
4,steady little table fan,i use the fan on a dresser in room about 12 x 32.it provides a good airstream without excessive noise or rattles.on oscillate it doesnt creak or snap.
4,nice little fan,"good little fan, surprisingly blows a good amount of air. we use fans in the house to provide some white noise so that when the 3 year old is tearing around the house, the 14month old isn't too disturbed when taking a nap. at home we use a 20"" lasko box fan, and when it's on the highest setting, you can't hear anything outside of the room. I bought this fan to take on vacation with us, but it turned out not to be loud enough. took the lasko. will be keeping this fan anyway for other rooms in the house."
2,If you're looking for a quiet little fan -,"- this isn't it. It does move a surprising amount of air for such a small fan - but it's also noisy for its size. After the first 5 hours of use (Low setting, Oscillation mode), it developed an annoying click - which disappeared when I switched the fan to Stationary mode. Still too loud (even on Low) to permit relaxed sleep (bedroom) or hearing the TV/stereo (living room)."
4,Getting Started,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is more a pep talk than a program of action. Its proposals for action won't be any surprise (make a list, set a timer and commit to doing a specific thing for an hour) and the little quotes at the end of every chapter run the gamut from truly inspirational to trite. However, everyone knows what they should be doing; the book aims to make you feel that you can actually do it. To that extent, it's very successful. You finish it feeling energized and capable of doing anything. Time will tell whether the feeling lasts, but at the moment I feel empowered and ready to take on a host of new things. Thanks, Rita Emmett!"
2,I haven't got around to reading it yet.,Yeah im pretty sure this book is great but I haven't got around to reading it yet... I think im going to start tomorrow... ah nah thats too soon.
3,basic but good,In a very simple but honest way the author help us be free of the bad habit of procrastination and show us how to master atitude to overcome this
2,not very enlightening,Most of the material are easy to find for free online. Not worth reading a whole book over. Just go on Youtube.
4,Swerving round the Hays Office,"Not quite the best of Jean Arthur and Joel McCrae, but amusing none the less. The sit in the com is the accomodation shortage in Washington after Pearl Harbour, when the New Dealers hadn't moved out, but when FDR was drafting in all available expertise, regardless of party, to hit the Pacific running. Arthur sublets to Charles Coburn, who further sublets to McCrae, reckoning that Arthur needs a husband, and that McCrae fits the bill admirably.The pair drive a coach-and-four through the Hayes Office's one-foot-on-the-floor rule by occuping parrallel beds visible from the foot through two adjoining windows, allowing viewers to ighore the wall between the two bedrooms.Many pertinent cracks at politicians - times have not changed. Only the pork barrel's got bigger - and the President's brain smaller."
2,Didn't care for this movie,"I knew that this would be a kind of silly 50's boy meets girl movie, but it was even sillier than I expected."
5,The More the Merrier,This is one of my favorite movies. The DVD is in excellent condition and I received it quickly. I watch this film over and over again and I still enjoy it..
5,Best Violin Rosin,"I purchased this for myself and for my sis-in-law as she and I feel this is the best rosin in the world! It is long lasting, produces minimal dust and creates a very nice quality sound without too much bite. I will definitely buy more and recommend it highly..."
1,Defective Seagate Freeagent,"I was told by our friend, who is a pro computer guy, to get this Seagate Free Agent external hard drive so we could back up our computer. He sent me the link to the Amazon page and I ordered it. When it arrived he came over to do the back up. After hours of frustration, long story short, the Seagate was found to be defective and I have to box it up and return to the company. In the meantime we got a LaCie and did the backup in record time."
1,HORRIBLY DESIGNED,"Breathe on it and USB cables falls out. The connection plugs (power and USB are horribly designed) Move it, and you lose power. Do these folks use their own product? I doubt it, or else they'd make them user-friendly. Maybe they're masochists. Certainly sadists. Outside package misleading as hell. Says it's Mac-compatible. Well that is only if you know you're supposed to re-format it upon connecting. No such mention anywhere on box or manual. Shame on Seagate for making such a crappy product. Hope they sink soon."
3,Elegant looking but flawed in performance,"Like the previous review, the only gripe that I have is that it isn't recognized when I first boot. It hangs in the post when it gets to that drive and I have to start the boot over again and then it is recognized and the boot continues normally. It's as if the post sends the inquiry to the device before the drive is powered up. So, as long as I reboot, the drive is still powered up and there is no hesitation on recognition.I have several other external drives, namely the Seagate eSATA External Hard Drive with the power switch and have been satisfied with them. Apparently they power down if you aren't using them event though the power switch is on. This causes a brief delay when you want to access them but they are recognized with no problem in the boot process."
1,BEWARE,"Seagate has attractive packaging, graphics, and web page, but it's product and customer service are very poor, in my opinion. I bought this external drive a year ago. It worked fine for 10 months, then reported errors on it like ""file or directory is corrupted and unreadable."" Also ""File $Mft is corrupt and unreadable."" I ran Seagate software and Chkdsk to repair the problems, but my efforts were not always successful, but always time-consuming. Seagate sent me a used replacement drive, and it has the same problems! This product seems unreliable, which is the problem you buy an external drive to avoid. Reliable backup is key. Customer service by phone with Seagate is almost impossible, real torture, huge waste of time. Rather than try a third drive, I have written off this purchase and will avoid Seagate in the future. BTW I have another external hard drive by a different manufacturer, and it works fine."
3,Faulty Power Cord,"The hard drive arrived with a faulty power cord. Very disappointing! Otherwise, I haven't had any problems yet."
5,"Attractive design, Functional, Backed up by SERVICE","I selected the Seagate FreeAgent Desktop 250 GB USB External Hard Drive after reading a few online reviews. I saw [...], as usla, had a fair price and they are reliable.When the product arrived, I followed the brilliantly simple directions and it did not back up my data. I emailed them after I found I could not answer my questions using the HELP online at the site. Got a speedy answer that I needed to reformat the hard drive for my Mac.Simple instructions, instant happiness.That's all we want from our products. Thank you."
2,Works ok but not very reliable,"This backup drive gets the basic job done but is not very reliable. I have it connected by USB to my desktop and have my own backup software that is scheduled to copy over changes in my files/folders every 24 hours. Problem is the drive becomes unresponsive (windows can't read/write to it) after a few days of use. Only way to fix it is to unplug its power, wait a few mins (maybe it needs to cool down) and try again. Have not actually lost any data yet but have had to deal with a few out of date backups."
1,NEVER BUY THIS POS EXTERNAL,Ok here it is I bought one of these from walmart I plug it in and for a week it ran like a champ then one week boom it died I had my receipt luckily and returned it and got the same one thinking it was just that one repeat everything before and here I am with no receipt no music and out my ~100 dollars so all in all DON'T BUY THIS DRIVE
1,Defective,"Buyer beware. I too got a defective product. At first, it didn't properly connect to my PC; device was never recognized. Instructions say to power up then plug in USB, but PC could not read. When I connected to PC *then* plugged in power, it read the device.But just now, when I went to plug in to my new computer to transfer files, the device doesn't even power up.Pathetic."
1,Doesn't hold a candle to Stevenson's excellent history.,"I am very glad that I read and reviewed this book. But I say this only because it led to my discovering David Stevenson's excellent history. In ""The Origins of Freemasonry: Scotland's Century, 1590-1710"", Stevenson traces Freemasonry's humble, sober, workaday origins through the records of Scotland's stonemason lodges in the 1600s.I wish to express my deepest thanks to the Rational Mason from Cape Cod, who responded so ably to my May 22 request for such a history. Stevenson's book provided exactly the solid, thoroughly researched history I was looking for, in exactly the century that concerned me. Now I understand why I didn't find it sooner: I'd been looking for it among the English, but the events I sought took place among the Scots!Thanks again!"
1,Hogwash,"The author of this book has either made up his ""facts"" from whole cloth or has a seriously distorted view of reality. The book is worthless--more than that, it is harmful in that it originates or perpetuates absolute falsehood. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","Did Miranda Lee really write this book? I usually love her books, but this one was so bad. All through the book you have the herion, Brooke, whining and complaining to her feminist mother, about whether or not her husband Leonardo is cheating on her. Instead of confronting him about it she gives him the cold shoulder and acts like a witch. This goes on from beginning to end, oh instead of the sexual parts that take place. And at the end when she finally does decide to grow a back bone and confront him, she finds out that he really wasn't cheating, and instead of apolozing she wants everything back to normal. If I could rate lower then a one I would do it! I haven't read all of Lee's books, and the ones I do read are great, but A Marriage in Peril stunk from beginning to end."
2,Very disappointing for the money,"I recently purchased these thinking i was getting a very good pair of headphones. However I was proven very wrong as i tried them on at home and found they produce poor sound quality with a very thin sound. I do not reccomend these headphones, and I would only if the price were at least 50% of what it is now ."
3,do not buy them,"I got them at walmart for 34.99 what a rip off!!! I tried them , my mdrv150's sound better!!! They cancel noise but I have to agree with the electronics fan!!! The sound is okay but not great. so, I do not recommend them!!! They do not sound loud!!!"
2,Not an advanced book,"There are plenty of projects, but I wouldn't say it is for advanced users. It is a cookbook that introduces few, if any, advanced concepts. If you are an advanced user of After Effects looking for something more, then I recommend the Meyers books or the Total Training DVD's."
4,Good,"Projects shown in this book are commercial--- like sales advertisements, which is ok. If you have other Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and 3D Zaxwerks, you will enjoy this book better."
5,Great Sound,"We have had several different types of home theater systems and this one has had the best sound, easy to use."
5,Does what is supposed to do,No problems with it. I like that it shuts down and starts up with the computer. My initial backup of about 50gb using the Firewire took awhile but that may be more my computer than the drive.
4,Review from Mac user,"I've used this HD for over a month now. I'm a Mac user running OS 10.4.10 and connecting using firewire 400. I left the drive in the original format so I could copy data from PC's. The reason for 4 stars is because I had difficulty copying data from a friend's PC running Chinese Win XP. This could be caused by the language format, I'm not sure. The drive is fast enough and communicates well with my iMac. Sometimes I have to re plug in the power for the iMac to see it, but that is a minor problem. I would buy another one. The independent power is nice. The way it sits horizontally on the power strip isn't."
2,An Overwrought Melodrama,"This book is a disappointment in every way. It's not romantic (Claire & Adrian love each other right away and after that the book focuses mostly on the ""suspense"" part of the plot), it's not suspenseful (we know who the murderer is from the start) and furthermore, it's not even interesting. What it is instead, is REDUNDANT. Not one but TWO different people try to frame Adrian for murder and of course, Claire manages to get taken hostage by both bad guys, and so needs to be rescued not once, but twice. This book is boring, boring, boring. I had to skim the last third, I just couldn't slog through to the very end. Too bad I paid full price for it."
5,Essential Pocket Guide - Maybe Even More!,"I bought this guide along with the Frommer's guide to LA and I must say, it's hard to say which is better. Obviously, there is less text in this version, but the essentials of a trip to LA are laid even more bare in this pocket-sized guide. And the pictures get you excited to go!If you're interested in experiencing a typical LA tourist-style vacation, I can vouch for this guide as a must-have! Use it by itself, or supplement it with one of the larger guides."
2,Snooze Fest,"An emotionless album if ive ever heard one. Mediocre Musicianship and dreary drainingvocals. I wasn't expecting a rock album by any means, but there is a way to make slowand mellow songs have some feelings behind them. Sunflower and Like a Forest are thebest on the cd but the rest is just wish washy fillers with no structure what so ever. If youwant to see how its done, check out Human Drama, or even Mogwai. Totally differentstyles but these bands are aces at filling the songs with emotion. This is just a realSnoozer! If this is there best album I cringe just thinking about the others. (This is also in no way Folk music)"
4,Canada Geese in trouble,"Angela Dimato is a Special Agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department. She is called to serve as backup by her partner, but when she reaches him, she discovers that he is dead. She is assigned to help with a fishing tournament, and while there she discovers a flock of Canada Geese which exhibit the symptoms of lead poisoning. She begins to suspect that her partner's demise had some connection with the poisoning of the geese, and she begins to investigate with help from the local birders' group.This is my first Birdwatcher's Mystery, but it won't be my last. I am an avid birder, and I thoroughly enjoyed the descriptions of birds and bird activities which are part of this series."
3,"Not working for me, but maybe it will for you.","I was looking for something for my car, and although this says ""THIN"" style, it's still a little too thick for me. It is very firm, and this was uncomfortable for me. If you are looking for a good contoured shape and a very firm support, this might work for you."
3,Money not well spent,I bought this item for my wife who has a bad back and needs support when travelling in our car. This item did nothing to ease her pain and in fact it was to stiff. Life is full of mistakes like this. I'm sure it works for other individuals.
2,Not what I expected,"I heard one song on the radio and thought I would like it. Not what I expected. It was labeled as ""chill"" style music, but its not what you would expect to hear at a lounge environment."
2,Eh...not my favorite.,"I was actually kind of surprised....I wasn't really expecting how different this was going to be. To put it quite plainly, porcelein dolls scare the living heck out of me, so it's not my cup of tea. I'm more prone to the classical ballet scene...but I suppose that is just me. Really good on most terms, but on terms of the freakiness, I'll have to give it a 10..."
4,a good read,"The first time I picked up this book to read it, I didn't like it. Why? I'm not completely sure -- maybe I was too young. However, picking it up a couple years later I read straight through it in a few days. I'm fascinated by fantasy novels that take place in universes with obvious parallels to our own, and this book is definitely that. I found the beginning a bit difficult becaues some of the background information of the universe is left for the reader to figure out for his/herself (some things I'm still left wondering about). Another thing that was hard to get used to (but I liked it anyway) was the use of masculine titles (i.e. ""lord"", ""prince"") to refer to both male and female characters.For readers interested in universes with political/religious parallels to our own, I would also recommend Kushiel's Dart by Jaqueline Carey."
1,Not very good at all.,"This has gotta be one of the worst, grueling things I've read. It's one thing when you use descriptions to describe and enrich. It's a completely different other when you use them to take up space in a book. It feels as if the author wrote too many unnecessary details. Whereas Jordan's details add taste and texture to thicken the plot, Patton's details are just there; blocking the conveying of adventure or excitement or whatever it is that she had intended this to convey. Something's wrong with it, but I'm not sure if it's the excessive details, or if it's the way her details aren't woven but stick out like sore thumbs, or what...but for some reason, it doesn't quite fit very well. You may want to read this before buying it...read at least part of the book, the first two chapters or any random chapter in the middle, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Or if you don't, and you still like it, yeah, go ahead and buy it. But just a caution...read before buy."
1,Not Good,Torin TB202 Tool Chest with 3 Drawers - 2 PieceHad i known how cheap this was made i would never have ordered it. Very flimsy tin and i couldn't find any bearings like was stated in the description. Bottom door was bent from the drawer unit flopping around inside. Couldn't find any double wall metal as stated in description. Very poor packaging. Would not recommend at any price. Unusable - Am returning item
1,Not as lucky as the others,I was not as lucky as the others who were happy.This just did not work as a new Paasonic battery did.
3,good,"Good for printing pictures in genealogy books. Old pictures were not glossy, so Satin paper is better. thanks"
5,From a proud grandson,"An honest, realistic and introspective account of war. This book was given to me as a present from my grandfather almost ten years ago. In classic youthful, ignorant fashion, I dismissed it as the ranting of a nostalgic old man. Recently, I discovered the book in the sweater drawer of the clothing dresser in my room, the cover and binding still in immaculate condition and the text largely unread. I was surprised at what a quick and enjoyable read it was, full of important lessons. This eloquent account of a young man's experience in a war all but forgotten among those in my generation has brought me to realize that it is foolish not to listen to the old wartime stories of our grandfathers. Thanks Grampy!"
3,May not help Terk Antenna,"I bought this with the ""cheaper with"" selection on the Terk Technology TV-55 UHF/VHF HDTV Indoor/Outdoor Amplified Antenna. I'm using the antenna indoors and have a short run of cable to my TV.The signal booster made slight improvements on a few of my channels, but also degraded a few others. Since it appeared to help my stronger channels and hurt my weaker channels, I judged this was not the way to go for me.If you are going to mount this antenna outdoors or expect to have a long run of cable, your results may be better."
1,Save Your Cash,Don't waste any of your hard-earned money on this item. There was no discernable difference after installing this device on my system and I feel ripped off for believing the hype that it would noticably boost my signal.
1,Piece of junk! Won't ever purchase Sony again!,"This CD changer doesnt work well at all. We tried to play random, all discs and it just stops playing after about 5 or 6 songs. We thought it was just a fluke and have tried over and over and it does the same thing. If you are trying to entertain a group of friends with continuous music, it gets very frustrating having to get up and restart the darn thing. If you want something reliable, pass on the Sony. A message to Sony: spend less money on developing the new Playstation and more on making sure your other products function."
4,CD Multi Disc Changer,"I purchased this CD player based on the reviews from Amazon. I like the unit a lot. No problem when inserting CD's. I don't like it that there is no ""on-off"" on the remote, but trying to find one like that at a reasonable price was difficult. I really wanted one that could hold 5 CD's and had a clock/sleep timer. I have had two, both of which did not last. The RCA I have now I use for the radio and receiver for the CD changer. Works great. I did not realize the speakers in the RCA were so good until I hooked up the Sony CD changer. I am in no way an an expert in this type of thing, but I know what I want and for a good CD player the Sony fit the bill. I put it on repeat and can open the unit to change the CDs and it continues to play. It has more you can do but I haven't explored all the options.I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good CD player without the expense."
5,LOVE IT,I am happy to have purchased this 5 disc changer.I am very surprised that one cannot find these injust any store anymore.I love SONY
2,Sony,"I bought this 5-Disc changer, but no remote and no instruction and no 3 color cord. Looks like someone is using before send it to me. The sound is very, very low. I will not return, but think of some way how to order the remote and the instruction for this. Thank you."
1,Defective shipment,"I had owned a similar Sony carousel for many years. I was very satisfied, and replaced it with a new Sony model. This arrived defective. The retail company said to contact SONY. I am busy and haven't done that yet. This seems no way to be treated."
3,So So,"Basic 5 CD changer. I cannot believe, however, that you have to power this thing on and off manually. Even at $119 that is just basic. Sound quality is fine though."
1,If you're a masochist then this is for you.,"Regrettably, the joke was on me.I haven't bought anything this bad since I can remember. I think it did work once, so perhaps I'm being unkind about the ""sound quality"". Usually it would just cycle through all the discs and then give a read error. Giving up on it after a few days of a plethora of half-hour attempts to get it to work I gave it to a friend (maybe not anymore?) {actually I would have gladly paid the amount of this machine to have it disappear} who also had a dead CD-changer, funny part, it was the exact same model as this. Well at least I didn't have to make a trip to the dump to get rid of this. HA HA."
5,Great CD Player,I bought this CD player over three years ago and I have never had any problems with it. Maybe some of those experiencing problems are using poor quality discs. If your music is manufactured in Mexico expect trouble. Poor quality in reproduction is a big factor. I would recommend this player to my friends and anyone who is looking for a good affordable player.
3,I could have kept my old CD player,"I bought this 5 CD changer because my 7 yr old changer was starting to cut out in one channel and the folks at the local Radio Shack suggested it was likely a problem with the machine which could be more expensive to track down than buying a new machine. After several uses, I've noticed my new CDP-CE375 Sony changer is doing the same thing my old changer did."
3,Doesn't do well with CDs,This player skips on many of our cds which didn't skip in the old CD player. Dissapointed with this.
5,"A ""must have"" of the French garage music scene","This vital album shows the deluge of external cultural influences that are shaping both French music and society. Musically rich, at times both playful and tongue-in-cheek, this album showcases ""garage music"" a la francaise with its Spanish and North African themes.The lyrics are both humourous and at times bitingly satirical. The images are likewise grotesque, compelling, and laughable: showing the tragically mundane in everyday life.Perhaps the lead singer's best work before his unfortunate overdose."
3,maybe not,"I am also a startrek fan and not being able to find all the books in this format is not good enough for me, but the design and all seems good but it needs more."
4,didnt need,didnt need worked better with configuration without it2 ways to set up the one with out it worked better
3,Too small for a pickup,"These flaps may be fine for a car, but they are too small for a pickup. By too small, I mean that they don't hang down low enough for the Ford logo to be seen from behind, or for the mud flaps to do the best possible job keeping road grime, snow, mud, dirt, etc. away from your chassis."
5,mud flaps,These were a Christmas gift for our son-in-law. He will be able to get good use out of them. Good quality! Thanks.
1,Not too great,"This toy LOOKS fun, but has many design problems.Accessories are for Kelly, not Barbie. It is very hard to get Barbie to sit in the little chair- she just plops right off! If you have a textured tub it won't stick and the weight of the 'stamps' on the side make the whole thing just spin unpside down. The blue soap used to 'stamp' just runs all over when tipped, and it doesn't leave stamps on childs hand/body, just a blue blob of soap. Also the tiny accessories in the tray get into the bathwater and you have to fish them all out before you drain tub unless you want them clogging up your drain. MATTEL DID NOT PRODUCT TEST ON THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,To be taken with a shaker of salt,"I was very turned off by Lindskoog's tone. Her unrelenting hatred for Walter Hooper -- a man she is clearly intensely jealous of for taking a job she desperately wanted when he became Lewis' editor instead of her -- shows a terrible personal bias that mars the whole work.Her unforgiving and un-Christian attitude would seem to indicate that she hasn't really read or understood anything that C. S. Lewis wrote, at least. The whole thing just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth -- instead of ""protecting"" Lewis, she may well turn many readers completely away from him... legitimate works or not."
5,Excellent CD! Must have for Vocal Trance collection.,"I ordered this CD from a private dealer and it is awesome. I didn't know what to expect but the entire CD is a good collaboration of their work. I wish it had a couple of other mixes but that's life, always wanting more. Great job Milk Inc. The only con is the third CD, the videos, won't play on a Mac only a PC. Bummer.- DJ Riceburner"
3,Beware Vinyl Lovers,"None of the receivers sold here say if they are turntable compatable. Obviously, they don't care. Just want to make a sale. It's a good receiver,I hated to return it."
1,So sorry,"The songs were great. Unfortunately whoever did the mixing on this was really heavy on the orchestra, thus drowning out the lyrics, which is why I purchased this selection. So Sorry I just couldn't hear Julio sufficiently to make this worth the price. Not a good value for price. Second rate electronics."
1,Garbage,"This battery worked great the first 5 weeks, then almost immediately it now only holds a charge for 15 minutes at a time."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality item. 1/2"" portion twisted first time I used it. Should be one piece construction, but 1/2"" section is a separate piece riveted on. Returned for refund which went fine. Found a better one at NAPA."
3,It always amazes me....,"...Just how many people out there think the Jerry Springer show is real. These are the same people who scoff at pro wrestling as being ""fake"". Here's news, folks: The Jerry Springer Show is SCRIPTED. ALL of it. COMPLETELY fake. I have several friends who appeared on the show (they are actors) and played a part. They were told what to portray, and how to play the part.This doesn't eliminate the entertainment value of the show, however. Pro wrestling is entertaining even though it is scripted, the same is true of Springer. Just realize that what you are watching isn't real, and never has been. Remember when the allegations about the Morton Downey show being fake surfaced? The Springer show is today's Morton Downey Show!"
2,good enough but repetitive,"It is definitively not too hot for TV. Don't expect to see much in it, just your usual, every day, talk show, with a marketing fancy title attached to it.Besides, most of the clips are the same: ""I slept with your brother"", and then a fight starts. It's better to watch a Jackie Chan movie for that.It's maybe nice to see once, but disappointing to own."
1,Configuration Nightmare,"I have an IT background and could not get this extender to work, despite a lot of time and effort wasted. It`s gathering dust in my closet, don`t consider this product."
3,Good Buy,Good buy for the price. A little hard to setup but was helped out with the instuctions from prior reviews. Single good be stronger but all and all worth the money as a range extender.
4,Works pretty well,"Had a tough time finding the signal at first. I didn't set it all that far away from the router, but once I found a good spot, I had about a fifty foot extended range. Again not as far as I would have liked, but it gets me halfway across the house and that's OK. I had no problems with this extender and Vista. I did not try to use it as a router. For a less expensive repeater and a short signal extension I will recommend this, but if you're looking for a long distant repeater you may want to try another unit.[[ASIN:B000FTLOL0 Belkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range ExtenderWireless-G Universal Range Extender]]"
1,Fizzle for the buck,Could never get this unit configured to work properly.A total waste of money and and a lot of my time.In fact it took less time to finally hard wire that computer (thru walls and floors) on the other end of the house with cat5e cable.Its now faster and I do not need that piece of junk.
1,just returned this; defective,"Setting this up is not an easy thing as most reviewers described. For me, the frustrating part was that the web management UI. It kept crashing every time I had to make changes such as changing SSID, WEP key, etc. After the crash, I had to reset the whole thing. This cycle continued without any success; finally I gave up and returned the piece of junk."
1,We send it back!!!,"It wasn't working properly. We send it back, and now we are waiting for our refund (2 weeks already)"
1,"piece of junk, tech support useless","i've spent about 7 hrs with tech support now to try to get this up & running -- i'd say it was a joke if it wasn't so painful. after all of this time, they finally gave up & said it must be broken, send it back in. so i did, and so far this one isn't working, either. don't really have 7 more free hrs to get this working so not sure what i'm going to do. just wanted to advise to run don't walk to get another extender if you can."
1,poor support/broken device,Device failed to amplify the signal and in fact caused some interference. After spending 60 mins with level 1 tech support call was escalated to the level 2 technician who was unable to sort this out either. After 40 mins on line with her I was told that device is clearly defective and should be returned. 1 star rating reflects inability of the tech staff to diagnose and distinguish broken device from operational one as well as fairly poor documentation in as far as what troubleshooting steps and/or options are.
4,Installation & Setup,Belkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range ExtenderBelkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range ExtenderSetup was a problem as instructions that came with product do not adequately discuss IP addressing issues of device in LAN setups.Belkin tech support was poorly informed of LAN/IP addressing issues. Had I followed Belkin's instructions the wireless device would never have worked at all and I would have returned it as defective.If buyers want to use this device in a LAN repeater mode they will need to be quite familar with LAN/IP addressing issues.
1,What a piece of junk,My brother-in-law and I spent many hours trying to get this thing to extend his network. I took it home and tried to get it to work on mine - but it just won't work. Perhaps I got a bad one? It just doesn't work according to how it is supposed to work per the directions. Don't waste your money on this thing. Buy a bigger and better antenna for your current wireless router instead.
1,doesn't pick up signal!!!,"The ""range extender"" only picked up my routers signal after the eighth try. Then when I moved the extender to the desired location, it no longer picked up the signal. It requires you to have an unsecure connection in order to relay the signal. This was a waste of time and money."
2,Should be a good product but lacks set up instructions,"The product information makes this look like it would be a wonderful product to extend the range of a home wireless system. It might be good and easy to set up on an UNSECURED network but not so on a secured network. Unfortunately, I failed to completely read the warnings from others on the set up problems. I typically have no problems setting up equipment even when others say they have had a hard time. I am a licensed electrical engineer with a lot of computer experience and the only reason I didn't send this thing back is because i was not going to admit to defeat. This extender is impossible to set up on a secured network if you use the included instructions or the web site. You need to search the web to find useable set-up instructions. Unless you are crazy enough to use an unsecured network or you are good with electronics and computers don't even try to set this thing up. If you do try, plan to spend a lot of time doing it."
4,easy setup as an extender,"I found that (using it as an WiFi extender) the one-touch setup worked great. Powered it up, pressed the button 10 seconds, done. Signal is much improved on my second floor now. It could come with a longer antenna but it's replaceable so I am getting a better one soon."
3,"Ok, but not great","Works reasonably well. The range extension is not huge, but it is noticeable. Downside is that if the mother wireless modem for some reason (loss of power, for example) stops broadcasting, the range extender does not automatically pick it up again when the mother resumes sending. You have to reinitialize. Annoying."
1,Horrendous Support,"They claim that this product will work with any router? Not true, I am an IT professional and I couldn't get this unit to work with my netgear router. The instruction manual says to hold down a button and you magically connect. Of course there is not a shred of information if this magic doesnt happen. After 4 hours with tech support, who must have asked me my name/address/phone/serial number about 8 times as I was taken on a magical ride touring a myriad of complete idiots. They tried to tell me to eliminate all of my network connections, settings, cookies, internet files. What do cookies and TIFs have to do with connecting to a network? Don't waste your time with this."
4,best vcr out of 3,"I received this Sony SLV-N51 vcr on my B'day in 2002; never had a problem with it. I am thinking about buying this same model again, because our other vcr's (different brand's) quit playing."
2,NICE PACKAGE LITTLE SUBSTANCE,"THIS PRODUCT HAS GREAT ACCESSORIES, BUT AFTER THREE MONTHS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRACKING, ESPECIALLY WITH OLDER TAPES. THE RECORD FEATURE SEEM TO ALSO MALFUNCTION (I'M OFF TO THE REPAIR SHOP THIS WEEK!) THE REMOTE IS ALSO A BIT COMPLEX, BUT IF YOU LIKE GADGETS THE REMOTE IS A THRILL. THERE ARE A BETTER WARRANTIES FOR LOWER PRICE MODELS LIKE THIS ONE SO SCOUT AROUND CAREFUL AND IF YOU NEED TO SPEND FIFTY DOLLARS MORE --IT JUST MIGHT BE WORTH THE INVESTMENT. HAD I DONE THE RESEARCH PRIOR TO THIS PURCHASE I COULD HAVE SAVED MYSELF THE TROUBLE."
1,Impossiable To Use,"Well tried using it for the first time and had to go back to the old piece together rod cleaning kit to even get my gun clean, the cable is flemsy as can be, the patches that come with it I cannot even get to stay on the end of it and when you do they are so big they will not go down the barrel of a 308 without trimming them, I dont know how many times they come off or got stuck in the barrel and if you do fold them to get them to stay on there it will not go down the barrel of the gun it is so thick. It is nice to pack into hills but if you need to clean it you would be better of cutting off a stick from a tree and making your own rod with then trying to use the cable and patches that come in this kit."
5,my 308 loves this system,my 308 loves this system. My remington 700 308 loves this cleaning system from Otis. I clean it after every outing. Dont come near 500 yards!
5,A masterful look at the real forces that drive Yellowstone,"Along with Paul Schullery, who not long ago penned the insightful and important Searching for Yellowstone, and Richard West Sellars, author of the definitive history of science in the U.S. National Park System titled Preserving Nature in the National Parks, Jim Pritchard has established himself as one of the premier observers on the often perilous collision course between science and politics. While Pritchard's Preserving Yellowstone's Natural Conditions: Politics and the Perception of Nature is destined to become required reading for university environmental studies programsas well it shouldit is a lively and entertaining read for anyone who loves our national parks, but in particular the mother of parks, Yellowstone. He deserves praise for a fine piece of work."
3,Good But Not Great Drum n' Bass,"Don't even think about this album if you don't appreciate even a little drum n' bass. In regards to this genre of electronica, it is a fairly good album. However, the pace is a little too unrelenting for my taste. A couple of choice slower-tempo drum n' bass tracks interspersed in the set would have been a simple but effective way to add a little flavor and creativity to this album. Majik likes it quick and this album is high energy all the way through from start to finish."
3,micheal blanke,"I bought this cd because of the two or three great new songs it did have.So beware this cd is a compilation of material from the 3 cds that directly preceeded this one, and a couple of tracks that were released as singles."
2,What were they thinking??,This is just a hodge podge mix of non album singles and remixed materialtaken from various times of the group's exsistence as a recording entity.I will recomend this only for the die hard Boney M fan in search of anything and everything the group recorded.
4,A surprisingly good effort,"This Boney M album was released in the 80s and definitely has a different, more modern sound than their previous 70s albums. It is a surprisingly good effort, with some very catchy tunes like ""Happy Song"" and ""Barbarella Fortuneteller"". It should've been a hit but wasn't."
4,One of Those Rare Gems,"I'm just another person who greatly enjoyed this movie. I'd call it a supernatural western, and a very good one. Good performances. You care about the characters. The plot sucks you in and you and really ride along. Good twists and mystery until the end."
5,The Title That Caught Our Eyes,"As my wife and I are devout Catholics and checking what wason TV one Saturday afternoon during our little one's nap, thiscaught our eyes immediately!We have seen this movie every time is has been on when we've hadthe time to see it. I taped it and bugged two of our teenagedaughters to watch it. They begrudgingly accepted our invite,and were slowly pulled in like we had been. They were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed it!For more proof of this being a worthwhile ""movie shot"" for you-The reason I'm here right now at Amazon writing this review isbecause I am shopping for Purgatory on DVD!!!Although it is far from Catholic doctrine on purgatory, it isa very well done, thoughtful piece of work.It will make you think and at the same time it is definitelyentertaining you!"
1,Didn't Like It,I'm a huge Eric Roberts fan but this movie didn't deliver.It was all around weird and I didn't find it intersting.I'm not a big fan of westerns either.I enjoy Eric Roberts in many different type of roles but I just didn't care for him here.I say skip it.
1,i loved this movie,"the first time i saw this movie was on tv.it was so good.every thing seem so real. it took me just a few min, to findout that all these people were dead, eric roberts was greatin purgatory. you will not go wrong buying this movie"
4,more then a western,"this movie more then your average,shootem up western!really,this is a tale of redemption .well written,acted, and directed...I got flick as gift for my wife[she rated it 5 stars!]"
5,Great Western,"It is truly a great western with a little different style. Has the names of several old western outlaws and some new ones, too."
5,Purgatory,"I stumbled across this movie one afternoon. I asked my wife to join me, the movie looked fairly interesting from the advertisements. we never left the room. We could not remember the last time we had been spell-bound by a movie. It held us the entire time. Kudo's to the actor's, writer's and director."
5,TiVo Rocks!,"I recently purchased a Sony DirecTV receiver with TiVo built in. This has been one of the best electronics purchases I have ever made. TiVo is easy to use, fast, and smart. Want to record anything ever directed by Tim Burton? Set up a Wishlist and TiVo automatically searches through thousands of entries and records anything directed by your favorite director. The same can be done with actors. And you can search by keywords. My wide is a huge Lakers fan, so I setup a Wishlist that was set to record any event in the Sports->Basketball category with the keyword ""Lakers."" We never miss a game now. The interface also makes this a great product. Forget Micro$oft's UltimateTV. I've played with it too. It doesn't even come close to TiVo. Make the investment, you won't regret it."
1,Sony sucks-TIVO rules-a dicey combo,"I own three Sony Basic Boxes and the SVR-2000. All sony, all hooked up to the same dish through a 4way channelmaster.There is no length of complaints long enough to describe the woefule Sony unit. Its menus suck, there is no ""favorites"" capability so you have to troll through menu after menu if you do not remember the exact station number. You cant set up short cuts, in fact you cannot navigate as easily as you can with the basic units. You rarely if ever know if a pay per view is in letterbox on the TIVO/Sony, always on the Basic box. The unit randomly freezes, and loses the signal monthly. The basic boxes, never.And SONY has the absolute worst warranty & worst customer service on the Planet. If you anticipate speaking with a SONY or TIVO rep, plan an afternoon or evening. Since TIVO is a very worthwhile service however, I'd recommend another manufacturer as an alternative to having two such customer unfriendly companies to deal with. Stick with TIVO, Sell sony."
5,I Couldn't Put it Down,"I had never heard of Palfrey, but I'm wondering why. This novel was excellent, and it kept me up late two nights in a row just to finish it. Despite the scandal, I could see what happened to Vivian happen to someone in real life. As soon as time permits, I'll be purchasing and reading the rest of Palfrey's books."
2,Unsatisfied,"Norton Save and Restore V2.0After installing the software I found that it doesn't support incremental or differential backups, nor does it allow scheduling of backups to DVD drives. So I returned it."
1,Sony Let Down,"Except for slow changing of discs, especially in shuffle mode, the unit performed well for the first week. After that there has been a repetitive problem of discs not falling properly into their respective slots after play. Sometimes the CDs fall into the interior of the player and can be fished out easily after removing the unit's cover, but often they jam and result in damaged CDs. I no longer use the unit. It is still kept in my audio rack for appearance, as I had to customize the rack to accept a player its size."
3,i miss tv in hd,i love the dvd but damnit i hate it how you can tell it's not hd. i wish hd was something everything had fomated for
3,Still Elvira,"Not as fun as it could be, but still.. She cracks me up. She knows who she is, what she is, and she has a ball with it. Age might be slowly creeping up on Elvira but it hasn't affected (nor improved) her acting or her jokes.Everyone else did an ok job in the acting dept, the script was typically Elvira, and the sets were excellent. I had fun with it. Set it on the shelf with Mistress of the Dark. Not as good, but worth seeing and giving out an occasional snicker."
1,Absolutely awful,"I should say that I LOVED the first Elvira film. A classic camp, ridiculous comedy!I was SO excited when I heard a new film had come out.Wow - was this the biggest let down!Its appalling - beyond bad.Its not even so bad it's good - its just BAD.Elvira is Elvira- the blame doesn't necessarily lie with her.the co-stars are awful (Richard O'Brien should just bask in his Rocky glory - obviously a one-off), and the direction is terrible - I dont think the director has any understanding of comedy.However - judging from the other reviews here, its obviously a love or hate film..."
3,Elvira <3,"I personally love Elvira. This movie was good, but I have to say I prefer Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. This movie has laughs and is a great watch, but I wouldn't actually buy it, like her other movies."
2,Dumb Movie,The Elvira character is funny and very watchable. The first movie in this series is good. This one is not. Too bad. Don't know what happend but Casanndra Peterson is a good comedian.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS MISTRESS OF THE NIGHT,"THIS ONE FALLS A LITTLE SHORT OF ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE NIGHT, BUT IS STILL ENJOYABLE VIEWING. IT IS MORE OF A PLOT THING THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IF YOU ARE A ELVIRA FAN, YOU'LL STILL WANT TO WATCH THIS ONE."
5,ELVIRA RULES!,"She's back at long last! This film is soooo Elvira! Complete with her classic one liners and corny special effects this movie rings true! See Elvira get her groove on - complete with applause! Don't watch this if you're not a big fan of the classic bad horror films that Elvira is famous for hosting, this time she is in her own!"
3,Censored language (& scenes?) from WalMart,"I bought this set out of the discount bin at the local WalMart. I didn't notice it the first time I watched, but the second time I watched these, I noticed that the dialog had been edited to just blank out some curse words. The most blatant editing is on ""High Plains Drifter""... in six or seven places. And, I think Clint's sex scene in the barn has been shortened.I am wondering if these sets are all like this, or was this just done for the Wally World soccer-mom crowd? I have heard that WaldoMart does this to other videos. True? If it's just on this set, than the set stinks. ""High Plains Drifter"" (originially released with an 'R' rating) was meant to be gritty.Well, so much for the nanny state. Big Brother is watching out for you."
4,nice collection for professionals,"I must say, it is not a textbook in the proper sense, but an overview of current research; hard to penetrate for a novice. Very thorough."
3,Good Product but does not play all types of DVD's,The product is excellent and plays well for my needs on the formats that it supports. I do have a concern that most of the available formats of DVD/CD/VCD are not played by this player and hence you have to resort back to playing on the laptop.
1,Faulty Design,"We purchased this product in March 2008. In November of 2009 the machine kept shutting off and eventually started smoking. We found that other people complained about the same problem. We contacted Samsung and all they offered was to pay for the parts (about $5 worth) but we would be responsible for the labor ($160). We decided to put the $160 toward a more reliable product like Sony. This is the first and last time we ever buy Samsung. They are aware of the faulty design and are not willing to stand behind their product. I bought a anwering phone/cordless phone system from Panasonic 2 years ago and I no longer had a receipt. I called them up because it was not working. They paid for me to ship it back and they gave me a refurbished answering machine. No questions asked! That is a company that stands behing what they make. Don't by this model, the fan cannot cool the unit off and it overheats."
3,"Excellent when works, breaks easily!","I have been happily using this home theatre for 2 weeks. After each movie, I would think ""totally worth it!"", with a big grin on my face. The sound is excellent. But tonight, I inserted a VCD and the system did not like it. When I hit the ""eject"" button to remove the CD, the tray came out withot the CD on it! It is not closing anymore. The tray is kind of loose now. I will return the system tomorrow. Might buy a new one again. It is still worth it."
2,Decent material but horrible binding,"The book is a necessary evil since Lindeburg is definitely the go-to author for EIT and PE preperation. The material is great and structured nicely and I think it will help me be successful on the exam. However that's all over-shadowed by the fact that after only a few weeks, the binding on my brand new book has already split! I glued it together, but pages are still falling out and ripping away one by one! That's absolutely miserable ""Professional Publications, Inc!"" We bring these books into the exam room and they must survive enough that we can flip back and forth between pages! I'm not just whining; the binding on my 7 year old McGraw Hill ""Marks' Handbook"" is perfectly intact, even after a three year period of almost daily use. For a $160 book, way to cut corners PPI! Thanks."
5,Sinlge Most Import Resource for Passing PE Exam,"I purchased the Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual and the Practice Problems for the P.E. Exam. After using these two items for a three month self-study course, I took them as exam reference material along with a few other books. As it turned out, in my case, I did not need any of the other reference material besides these two PPI publications. After becoming familiar with the reference manual over the three period; on exam day, I was able to quickly find the reference information that was needed without having to fumble through several books or binders."
3,Sneaky little breakdown....,"This is in rotation for the military. I got it for a good price, it did well for about 6 months and now my computer will not recognize it. Once plugged in, the folders will start disapearing and then....nothing. Light is still on (it is always on), but nothing happens... Cant open, exchange or delet. I have about 400GB vested in this thing..."
1,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE!,"I've got 2 other FreeAgent drives, both 320GB and they are great. That's why I bought this, but I've spent a lot of time on the phone with Seagate & at Apple discussion forum over weeks and months. I've even gotten a replacement from seagate. All kinds of screwy things happen. Folders & files disappear & reappear. It disappears from my desktop and then needs Disk Utility repair when I mount it. BEWARE MAC USERS!"
4,Great hd,I use this on my Directv hd-dvr. I just plugged it in and it increased my storage space 2 1/2 times.
3,Depends on the Question,"Actually, I'm very skeptical of people who ""talk"" to God and then write a book so they can sell the rest of us ""His"" answers. I myself wrote a book about a man who also claimed to have direct conversations and get ""answers"" from God - and who is now serving a life sentence in Attica prison for murdering a great musician. But I got this book for my aging mom, and she seemed to find some good stuff in it, so it gets 3 stars from this faithful skeptic."
3,Never got the book but quick refund,I waited over a month for this book and still did not receive it. The customer service was very courteous and issued a refund immediately.
3,"Great ideas, as always, but...","Tom Peters brings plenty of ideas to the table (not so different from his articles in Fast Company, though). One huge problem with this book is the utter lack of control and respect given to the use of the written word. The random use of CAPITALIZATION to give force to Big Ideas is VERY DISTRACTIING and makes Me wonder where his EDITORS were in the Whole Process!!??!??!!!!Where or where have all the copy editors gone?"
3,Riddled with profanity - detracts from the message,"I've only gotten through a few pages, and am very surprised at the profanity in it. Not the severity, but the volume of it. Profanity is usually a sign that the writer does not know English very well, which I doubt is the case with Mr. Peters. In the future, I would suggest he look up expressive words that are not profane, to try to get his point across. We don't use language like this in our house, so I'll be marking out his childish profanity in this book. As he says,For the one-in-a-hundred-thousand who doesn't 'get it'he needs to 'get it' himself.It's a shame, as I will probably agree with the sentiment (minus the profanity) that he is *trying* to get across."
4,Hokey? Maybe. But Inspirational....,"Sure, there are too many typeface changes and exclamation points, but Tom's given us plenty to think about in this book...and more importantly, to DO. (as he would say: ""Now."")I like the action-oriented approach and the fact that he tells you to read the book through, make notes, and then go back again to create your own plan. This was a huge battery-charger for me -- and I'm already a pretty charged ""brand you"" kind of person.I wish I had read this book during my previous job when I felt underappreciated, squashed, uninspired and generally unhappy. While the book wouldn't have changed the horrific management flaws in the firm where I worked, it might have given me the new lease on life I needed to make my time there more worthwhile and productive.So buy it, filter out what's too cheerleader-y for you and make more of your work days WOW days."
3,BE your OWN BRAND!!!!!!!!,"A lot of the advice within this book is sound: Be proactive. Sell yourself. Define yourself. Network. Take responsibility for your career success. As a junior professional, it's very important for someone like me to realise how these elements support and leverage one's actual capabilities in the workplace.However the author seems hard pressed to develop these into 50 distinct points. It becomes repetitive, which is why I would recommend dipping into the book as opposed to reading it cover to cover.The written style and tone becomes irritating. As other reviewers have noted, it's full of PHRASING like THIS!!!! HYPERBOLE!! INSPIRATIONAL CLICHES!! I wish instead of 5 word sentences the author had also offered more explanation and insight into the issues he raises."
1,"Probably some good information, but its buried","There is very likely some information in this book that is insightful and helpful, but I couldn't find it.The book reads as if you are attending a seminar taught by someone who was _really_ excited, and who had drank way too much coffee. I was really interested in hearing about brand and the new economy the author envisioned, but the book is just too distracting to read. I ""read"" about 1/2 of it, and I'm not sure if there were more than three full sentences that I had found up until that point. Text changes color, size, boldness throughout. Liberal and nonsensical use of punctuation is infuriating after the first page.The book reads like a spoken seminar, and squanders the opportunity of actually being a book, which could have afforded a more in-depth look at the authors ideas.I would highly discourage anyone serious about this topic from buying this book. It is more of a super-happy high school cheerleader dialog than any type of meaningful discussion."
2,"This is not ""how to"" book","""Talent"" by T.P. is better. This book consist of 50 main bullet points and possibly 6-700 sub bullets - all together a long list of nice things to think about but this is not a ""how to"" book as expected."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"Got this from my wife for X-mas. Couldn't wait to watch it; and then, nothing... This disc doesn't work in my PS3, but not sure about other Blu-Ray players as I don't own one. I checked all over the web for ""known-issues"" and nothing. Finally, I found a Facebook for the disc and ppl on there complained as well. Then today, I go back to the Facebook profile to check the comments again and this comment was left by ""That's It, That's All"" - ""If your Blu-ray copy doesn't play, please contact the store you bought the Blu-ray from to return it. Thanks""So... no word on the official website of this issue and it looks like they know about it. Way not Cool! They don't even say if they have fixed the issue or what? Guess I should just waste more shipping money and take a chance. What a JOKE?!?"
5,"That's it that's all, but I wish there was more...","Although not 100% in HD you can understand why no one would sponsor a high quality HD camera for them to tote around while hucking them selves through the air... Unbelievable scenery with unreal feats of acrobats off of kickers most people would go around... I watched it 4 times the first day and have shown anyone who'll let me...The music fits perfectly... get this now, stop reading and put it in you cart... seriously..."
4,"Nice Quality, My fault I didn't check the size","I have a few full sized movie trailer posters in my basement, including one for Vol.2, and I wanted to add one for the first movie. It's a fine looking poster, but it's a little smaller than the other ones (standard) that I have, so pay attention to the dimentions!It came fast from the 3rd party vendor as well, quicker than most of my Amazon stuff comes!"
5,My Brother's Voice,"Stephen Nasser's book is one of the most inspiring I have read about the Holocaust. His description of the harsh treatment he and his family received at the hands of the Nazis provides the reader with a vivid picture which becomes difficult to forget. And we should never forget what happened because to forget would be leaving ourselves open to repeat the mistakes the world made when it turned it's back on these atrocities. I would highly recommend reading Mr. Nasser's ""diary"" and experiencing for yourself what a remarkable journey he made as a young man cast into a world of hate, deception, cruelty, and unbelievable war crimes. His survival is a credit to his character and strength of purpose."
5,AMAZING!!!,"If you are interested in the Holocaust whatsoever this is a must read! I could not put it down. Its truly incredible what this man had to go through when he was just a young boy. I have had the privilege of meeting Mr Nasser. He is truly an amazing person and inspiration. I cannot imagine going through what he endured. This book is a wonderful depiction of what the Holocaust really was and how the love of family can help you make it through anything. Must, must, must read!!!!!"
1,CROSS STITCH BOOK,THIS ITEM WAS INTENDED FOR AN INMATE AT FTW FEDERAL PRISON. SHE NEVER RECEIVED IT.
3,"Good, but is it Good Enough?","It looked great on the outside. A book about how to do great in school, how to navigate your way around, and how to be popular. (I always wanted to know that) But when I finished reading it, it did not give any advice that I hadn't heard before, and it was very short. The parts that were good were good, but the parts that were bad were bad! It does not live up to its fellow American Girl books."
3,Okay advice,"This book is okay but if you are a Christian girl and you want a book with Christian values that talks about all sorts of stuff like friends and family and stuff then get ""The Christian Girl's Guide to Being Your Best"" by Legacy Press. You can also get a Christian book just about school called ""The Junior High Survival Manual."" You can get both at amazon too."
2,Don't buy the Kindle version!!,"I have a Kindle and enjoy saving a few bucks by purchasing the Kindle versions of books since I get them instantly and the price is a bit cheaper. I am running into a problem with my class because the electronic version of the book does not allow you to view about 90% of the images/figures/tables, etc. My professor specifically tests off some of these figures and I can't see them. I'm struggling in this class because of it, and it's too late for me to return the electronic version to buy the book version. Do NOT buy the Kindle edition!"
5,Fantastic Introduction to Family Therapy,"As a student of Family Therapy I am keenly aware of the need to have first-class resources that utilize proven techniques and that are theoretically sound.This text by the Goldenberg's, I have been told, is a veritable classic. I can see why. The book is very logical in its layout and construction, with the authors eschewing jargon and therapy-speak for clear, lucid, and cogent language.I have come to learn that there is a world of difference between individual therapy, and family therapy. The Goldenberg's make sure that this vital distinction is clear to the reader, and they do so without pedantry.I would recommend this book as a resource or as the primary text for any graduate level family therapy course. This book is so comprehensive that it can stand alone, or be used to supplement your studies."
4,Basic Counseling Textbook,"This is a textbook for a graduate class in psychology. If you need to buy it as a textbook, then of course, you must buy it. The chapters are arranged in an order that explains the history of family therapy and the basics. It is a general textbook. You will need other books to get into psychotherapy in a deeper way. However, as an introductory text, this is easy reading. It is called an ""overview"" because that is exactly what it is.My greatest advice for you is to not forget to use the website as a help to the book. The website backup materials will guarantee you to have a great grade in the course.This is found at: [...]"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought a Barbie Pixter, black and white format. I have tried to buy expansion software, but have been told that a black and white format will not support color software. I am so disappointed that Amazon and Toys R Us sell a product that has no software available to expand the unit I purchased. I feel that items like this (including the basic systems) should not be sold if they cannot support any available expansion software, they are basically obsolete."
5,It's Potty Time,This is an fun easy way to toilet train young children. I am using it now for a 31 month old who has a 19 month old sibling. They are both wathcing the video together. It is one of their favorite movies. To my surprise the 19 month old has been csught sitting on the potty singing the songs! Won't be long now for both children to be completely trained!!
3,"Odd video, but son LOVED it","I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This video has a very odd feel to it for adults. The little man and the clown made me very uncomfortable. However, my 3 1/2 year old son loves it. He is a very smart, head strong child who refused to use the potty. Ironically, he started urinating on the toilet the day that I ordered the video. I was going to cancel the order, but decided that it might be good reinforcement. Less than a week after receiving the video, he became a ""Super Dooper Pooper"". The video comes with stickers for rewards. I give it three stars because he likes it, but no higher, because I don't like it and those silly songs get stuck in my head."
1,silly and demeaning,"I wish I could return this one for a refund...I don't care when the birthday party is, I would like some advice and help with on e of the most stressful transition phases of parenting. Look elsewhere if you want help with toilet training."
2,unrealistic...everyone makes it to the potty?,"The ""Bear"" tape held my daughters interest to the point that she asks to watch and knows new vocabulary. I think it's sad that the muppet video is more realistic than Duke University's Medical Center's. Don't let the accolades fool you."
1,Save your money,"I waited a month after purchase to look at this with my son. What a waste of money! The tape is bad quality with many breaks of static. The story line is stupid. It should be titled, ""Lets go to a party"" which is what it is about. They do not show going on the potty. It reminds me of sitcoms of the 50's where married couples slept in twin beds - you know what's going on, so we do not need to show you. My son was totally disinterested. He got up and walked away half way through."
4,A Super Dooper Pooper,"My 20-month old daughter loves this video! Yes, it is as cheesey as they come, but hey, its not for adults.... its for children. The songs are catchy, it is helping my daughter not be afraid of the potty but I don't get the little man who watches everyone in the bathroom??? My daughter now wants to see this video more than Elmo or the Muppets. The real-life characters are what fascinate her. The birthday theme was a good idea but the clown is not (a little too much touching for me!) I can't complain too much about this video I bought it second hand..."
2,Not Enough Examples,"I bought this tape along with the Bear in the Big Blue House Potty tape.This tape is poorly produced, lacking in any real instruction and focus. My daughter was bored 3 minutes into the tape, whereas, the Bear... tape kept her attention.I am almost tempted to return the tape."
5,"""Wonderful""","To all of you that are looking to buy this cd, or even listen to it. If you appreciate talented, gifted musicians who totally rock you will love this. There is everything from songs that make you jam out,(Couch, Sophia, Clover),to aww, the sweet songs.(Dr Frank, Clover.) So make sure this is part of your cd collection... These guys are the next big thing."
4,Memory Does NOT erase when power goes out,"I am interested in purchasing this mega changer, but was put off by a review that stated the data you enter is lost if the power goes out. Skeptical, I called sony support and inquired about this problem. The memory WILL retain the data if power is lost...similar technology as flash memory I suppose."
2,Too Flimsey and Not Worth The Money,"I bought this for my son, who is almost 12 years old. He has many other K'Nex sets (roller coasters, space station, dragster...) and this one, for how much it costs, its not worth the money. When you finally build it, (it took him about a day) it wants to fall over. It doesn't do what it says, with the balls falling where they are supposed to. We are actually contacting K'Nex corporate to see if they would be willing to trade it in for another set. I would NOT recommend buying this. The rollercoasters are much more fun, and the kids don't get so frusterated putting them together."
1,This Toy is Horrible,I think this K'nex set is horrible. This is the worst set K'nex has ever made. After I built it it was leaning over and the balls wouldnt go up the chute.
1,A Nightmare,"This thing took about 6 hours to build. The directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow, but I figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool. Unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor, on fresh batteries, didn't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently. We spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it. Ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside. He looks really cool, but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot. I love KNEX, but this set is a DUD!"
4,Good for its purpose,"I bought this for a 91 year old who needs to use a cell but can't get the position right. It is extremely lightweight and feels cheap, but has a nice loud sound and the right ""angle"" for her. In our case, this was a wonderful find and has really solved a problem.But it is packaged in one of those annoying plastic packages that are so tough to open!"
3,Well written but very negative,"The book was highly readable, yet there were some weaknesses worth noting. While the author made very valid points, I thought the arguments were weakened in some cases by a lack of reliable citations. The only other criticism that I had was that in many cases, the author seemed to imply an intentional effort by hearing people to force deaf people into disability. In many places, the book compared the treatment of deaf people to cases of racism and slavery around the world. While undoubtedly some in the education system do look down on others, I thought that the specific examples shown in the book reflect more on the ignorance of the hearing doctors then an intentional decision to hurt the deaf community. With the exception of these problems, I thought the book was well written and gave an intriguing history of the problems facing people in the deaf community."
4,Fun Toy!,"My son is 7 months and he loves this toy! All the turning wheels and music are fun but the animals are a little too ""old"" for him yet, but they certainly are cute! Overall a very fun and entertaining toy."
5,Fun farm toy!,"I bought this for my son last Christmas and he loves it!There are a few functions he especially loves. The first thing he loves is the fact that the pig will oink over and over and squeal if he pushes it side to side. Good cause and effect education with that function. Same goes for the little carrots at the bottom. My son loves to push them over and over. It's repetitive but that's how children learn. It keeps his attention and that's a plus!Good toy is you are trying to teach farm animals and their associated noises.I wish the little animals that aren't attached did more or made the noises associated with them, but hey you can't have everything right?Over all a wonderful toy for infants and toddlers."
2,Dust Collector,"I bought this for my 11 month old -- and neither of us is thrilled. The cow, chick and horse come off, but nothing else does...this is frustrating for a curious toddlers. It may be entertaining for smaller babies, but with so much plastic already living in parents' living rooms, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. There is a reason it is selling for 60% off - it's not very much fun!"
3,Small Blankie,"When I first got this in the mail I thought it was so adorable, but like the reviews said it is very small. I don't think I would call it a blanket really but I knew what to expect so I was not surprised. As other reviewers said it does seem like the head isn't secured on there too well but if it doesn't bother you it can become two toys or with a few stitches it looks like it would be right back on the blankie. My puppy didn't seem to interested in it and on the second day of him having it it was a bit too close to his puppy pad and had be taken out to be washed. It washed fine didn't come apart or anything like that so that was good. Over all if you want something small with the sent of your puppy's litter mates and mom on it when your coming home this could be a easy toy/blankie combo."
2,Toy dog??,"I love how this blanket looks, but it is soooo tiny. It's literally the size of three hand prints. My westie is only three months and it won't cover him fully. Many people who reviewed this product said their dog bite the head off, but my pup hasn't. He doesn't seem to be interested in the blanket especially after we bought him a bigger and softer blanket. This ""blanket"" should be use to dry dishes. ;)"
4,History Silent Service,Enjoyed the material not exactally what I was looking for was lokking for the old series Silent Service
3,too short,"The sizing is not very accurate, the torso is way to short making this very tight in the groin area."
2,No wonder the markdown,"I puchased two of these for my twin daughters even though I had read the bad reviews. They were thrilled to get them, but one of them does not play CD's unless you put it on random. The play button does not work. I plan to try to return it to AMAZON."
3,Whoa!!! That's bright!!!,"So I love this clock...but it's really too bright. It lights up the whole room. I bought this clock so that I could listen to relaxation CDs to fall asleep...but...when the CD player is on, the clear rounded part that holds the CD lights up like a darn Xmas tree. I have to put something over this clock to make the room dark..other than that..It's great."
4,Really good product,I just got my radio yesterday and its really good the only thing stopping me from saying it is perfect is that it does not play mp3 discs you burn from your computer but for 10 dollars you cant get much better then this!
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this item despite the bad reviews it had gotten because I absolutely adored the styling. When it arrived, I unboxed it and checked everything. Clock worked great, radio was so-so, but not a big deal, and the CD had good quality sound for the price. Though I found setting the clock and preset stations a bit complicated for my tastes, overall, I was still pleased. The next week, the radio quit working--still no big deal--since I bought it more for the CD and alarm clock. The week after that, the alarm quit working. Then this week, the CD quit as well. I can't even get it to power ""ON."" Of course, by this time, I had long ago discarded the box, so returning it was out of the question. What I am left with is perfectly functional clock that keeps great time, but nothing else. Save your money and don't get sucked in by the design the way I did. They clearly need to make some MAJOR improvements on the function before I will EVER buy another one of these!"
4,Great item for the price!,"Ordered ALOT of these (approx. 80) for my workplace (skilled nursing/rehab center). Half went to each of the patients rooms and the other half went to staff who really liked them (quality is good, considering such a low price that I paid for these (9.97 each). Great features and easy to us(CD/Clock and radio). Not the best radio, but hey, it was only 9.97 each!"
4,Great desk radio,"Great little desk radio, can keep it low enough not to disturb my co-workers and plenty loud for me to hear it. CD player is a nice touch as well."
1,Poor choice,"The alarms works great. The radio and CD has a decent sound. Unfortunately, I needed a clock. The display can only be read when you are looking at it dead on. If you look at it from any angle, the display is washed in blue and cannot be read at all."
2,okay,The only reason I purchased this was because it was a cd/am/fm/weatherband. It actually doesn't have the weatherband capability.
1,Don't waste your money on this!,I bought several of these 1 year ago when they were selling for $5.99 each. It was a waste of money then. I can't beleive this thing is actually selling for over $100.00. RUN AWAY from this product!
3,An apologist's view,"The vast majority of this work is about other individuals and events. Elliot Goldenberg, the author, then justifies and rationalizes Jonathan Pollard's actions from these perspectives never denying he betrayed America but going to great lengths to detail what he did not do.Jonathan Pollard is a traitor whose loyalites lie with another country and betrayed his own. He is quoted, in the book, saying he 'wants to go home' sic. Israel. Israel, our puported ally, has never given an accounting of what Jonathan Pollard took from America and turned over to Israel and then what Israel then did with this information. However, Israel never misses an opportunity to seek his release."
3,A little bit of a chemical taste,"This product has a bit of a chemical taste, which it shouldn't, as it is supposedly all natural. It is very sweet, though, and those who enjoy a sweet coffee drink will like it. I didn't think it tasted of English Toffee, though. Probably won't purchase this flavor again."
3,The Rough Side Of Boarding,"The best part of this is it is about real people who had a special talent. The movie does not try to clean up the image of the people it portrays they are gritty and rough people.I enjoyed it I first saw ""Dog Town & Z Boys"" A doc. about the same people. The actions sceenes are great the actors are believable in the parts. Both Heath Ledger and John Robinson out do them selves in this movie. I found my-self dis-liking the people this movie is about but enjoyed the movie very much.I do recomend seeing it and Dog Town & Z Boys."
1,Even my Grandson Became Bored with this Movie,"Okay, this movie is supposed to be about three teen boys. However, I didn't know this when I tried to watch it with my grandson, and they looked to me like twenty-somethings who had never grown up. I guess they did to my grandson as well because, although he talks frequently about skatboarding when he gets a little older, he lost interest in the movie barely a third of the way through it. I felt the same about it - it was intensely boring to me to watch what looked like a bunch of immature guys doing their thing. Maybe if one is really into skateboarding this movie might be of interest. For me, and for my grandson, it wasn't worth the time spent watching it."
1,Too cool for a title,"If the documentary wasn't silly enough, here comes a feature presentation about kids whose only means of survival is skateboarding inside empty swimming pools. Empty swimming pools? How about a trip to the library? How about studying and earning good grades in school? How about being a responsible human being and not some drugged out loser wasting our tax dollars on drug rehabs and social welfare programs? In the end, it is us, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, that has to 'lend' a helping hand to these degenerates on wheels. How about a movie with this simple message: ""get a freaking job, loser, and quit skateboarding the rest of your life away."" Here's another idea, how about a movie that glorifies homelessness? How about watching some crusty bum urinate in the back of a garbage container and then climbing on top of a skateboard and riding off into the sunset shaking an alms cup?"
1,Not worth it.,I could not believe it was for only one cup. I did not read throughly and thought it was for four. Big dissapointment.
3,"Arrau is the greatest, but old sound quality.","I feel Claudio Arrau is one of the greatest pianists of the 20th or any other century, so I was looking forward to his interpretation of Bach with great anticipation.His playing is ... well, it's hard for me to hear past the antique quality of the recording. Some of his warmth comes through as well and his expressive playing. But it sounds like he's playing at the other end of a tunnel.I wish record labels would take the care to re-master these old recordings before releasing them; I can't believe it wouldn't profit them to do so. They would certainly honor the performers and their customers by doing so."
2,Tangential,"Book spent inordinate amount of time reviewing history of conflicts with neighboring tribes, didn't really focus on Yoruba customs, cosmology, etc."
1,Negative,Item arrived in a timely manner but will not take a charge. Contacted the seller immediately and have yet to receive a response as to how they would like to proceed.
2,not recommend,DVD player is not good. couple of my friends had samsung dvd player everybody has same problem.
5,Great!,"Free shipping, arrived a week early, easy to set up and sounds great...oh and it was a killer deal. Highly recommended!"
5,Upstairs/Downstairs season 3,Definitely addictive! Well done stories that make you care about the characters. Jean Marsh is outstanding in her role as the head downstairs housekeeper.
2,Can't compete with Disney,"Bland animation, embarassing acting (if you can call it that), stupid plotline, and overall, a mushy, moronic movie. The only thing that saves it from getting one star is the fact that the marvelous Tim Curry provides the voice of Drake and Martin Short as the voice of Hubie. Otherwise, very, very, forgettable, but not as bad as Little Nemo:Adventures In Slumberland."
4,very good family cartoon,"Very cute family movie.Its perfect for the whole family,and very entertaining.The soundtarck score is great,and it adds the movie a musical ""Style"" The most irritating carecter in the movie is Drake.He is so anniong,that I could .... him personally."
1,Nero 7 a disappointment,"What good is software that doesn't work?I have used Nero Vision 4 from my Nero Vision 7 Ultra Edition Enhanced successfully before to burn DVDs, but now all of a sudden when I click on ""Burn"" the program puts up a message saying ""Patent Activation Required"". When, as instructed, I then click on the ""Download"" button, I get a message saying ""Patent activation failed"" and am given only the option of aborting the program. (I am running no firewall.)An email to Nero support went unanswered. Shame on Nero for dumping this labor-intensive problem on its paying customers."
1,Disaster upon install,"This is one of the worst software products it has ever been my misfortunte to install. That is, try to install. Downloading at rates that remind me of acoustic coupler days. Failed updates that disable the software and cripple the operating system. And a download ""contact"" option that leads only to FAQs, instead of contact information. Save yourself major headaches - plus hours of your life - and find another way."
5,Nero 7 Ultra Review,"I originally bought a CD-DVD-RW drive that shipped with the O.E.M version of Nero 7. Every so often it would ""freeze-up"" and I would have to reboot the computer. Since I bought the full blown edition of Nero 7 there has been no ""freeze-ups"". What I really liked about this edition is it comes with about 20 programs and you have the option to install which ones you feel you may need."
1,Just not worth the money.,It's just a lot of flash that does nothing more than what your Windows XP Media Center Edition PC will already do.
2,old versions are better,"after i update it to the newest version , i throw about 2-3 cd's or DVD's cause of errors.i uninstall it 2 time and redownload it and i still receive the same problems /errors/crash.PS; i have a new pc ( core duo 3.2 - 3GB ram - 4mb cash memory etc... )"
1,Bad to the bone,These Nero releases are just bad software getting worse. I wish they would fix the encoding problems. I have wasted so many DVDs with encoding problems and audio/video out of sync etc. tech support want you to spend some time gathering logs and sending them in but then they do not respond!Nero 7 mostly just adds a jazzed up user interface.
3,Nero 7,The program does what it states but I had expectations of far better software than I found. The instructions provided were minimum and I do not appreciate paying for technical service if the problem is in their software design and not of my creation.
1,Awful piece of junk,"I downloaded the demo version of this horrible package, not knowing why it took so many megas..... Well, you get much more than just a cd/dvd recorder. You also get a ton of utilities that you surely had in your pc. But these new utilities work worst, make your pc unstable, and consume a huge amount of memory, slowing down the processor. Bay any means, try before you buy."
3,Photo toner,"Works good. I have bought the refillable ones and even though they say universal, they don't fit. So I am back to name brand. More expensive, but they work every time."
2,"OK, but expect better quality for the price","I've had these for a few months. You actually do get reasonable quality surround sound from the unit. However, as noted by several other reviewers, there is constant crackling and hissing in the background and the microphone falls off frequently. The noise get's worse if you use your keyboard or mouse. I'm using a high quality sound card in a well grounded computer. I used to put this computer's sound through a home surround sound amplifier and it was whisper quiet, so it's not an issue on my end. E-mails to customer support have gone unanswered.Bottom line...it will give you surround sound. If you are an audiophile, the background noise will really annoy you. It works for my purposes, but they should cost $29 like the other mid range consumer headphones."
4,Dangerously Delicious,"These are yummy (they taste like chicken noodle soup in stew form), but have an insane amount of sodium. Each bowl has only 160 calories, but a whopping 1320 milligrams of sodium, so I took off a star."
5,Puddle fun,"A young African American boy puts on his yellow rain slicker and boots and grabs his yellow umbrella to enjoy a spring rain. The simple text expresses the noises of a rainy day and the fun of jumping through puddles. The last page shows the boy standing barefoot in a puddle, arms spread wide, his beautiful eyes full of the joy and wonderment of a young child. The watercolor illustrations capture the essence of a wet day, from the rain pouring out of a downspout to the spray behind a car's tires on a wet street. Watery green and gray are predominant, with splashes of red and pink. The yellow of the boy's rain gear, a fire hydrant, a car, a house, and some dandelions provides a warm contrast, standing out just the way that bright colors do on a rainy day. This book is suitable for babies, who will like the contrasting colors, and for toddlers, who just may be reaching for their boots, hoping for rain."
2,Incorrectly titled,"This album is actually an ""Encore Collection"" titled ""Big Dreams"" and is NOT ""Big Dreams in a Small Town."" It's one of those two-ninety-nine bargain bin specials -- it doesn't even have an insert."
3,Interesting but too much Patton ends up ruining this imo,Great recording quality +1Interesting arrangements +1Killer bass & drum work by Trevor Dunn & Joey Baron +2Too much Mike Patton voice acrobatics -1overall I'd rate it a three.If I was Zorn I'd pull 75% of the Patton content and add the Masada String unit to complement this kind of work. The Patton yelling ends up ruining this just like adding too many hot peppers to the chili.
5,Hours of Fun!,"This book has dozens of fun songs, many of which I've never heard before but really like. At $6, it is the best money I've spent in a long time."
5,"If you are a King Arthur fan, this is a must-read.","This stunning conclusion to White's ""The Once and Future King"" is a vast departure from the tone that is set in the earlier work. Still, the characterization is extraordinary as White uses stream-of-consciousness to impart an aura not felt in ""Once and Future."" This is the final conflict, yet it is more of an internal conflict than an external one. This is not a struggle between good and evil, but of good versus good, which is the basis of many classics. This is destined to become such a tale"
2,A warning for fantasy lovers,"If you loved Once and Future King especially for the humor and whimsy of Sword in the Stone, you need to know that Book of Merlyn is a very different beast. The T.H. White who wrote this revisiting of the Arthur matter is not at all interested in story. He even seems to be using Merlyn merely as an excuse; what he wants is to vent on some pet philosophical ideas. And White had become seriously embittered and misanthropic by that time. The book was very disappointing to me and left a bad taste in my mouth. I choose to consider it NOT a valid part of the Once and Future King canon."
3,"Good,you will like it if your into fantasy stories.",it was pritty good but not as good as i thought it would be.Disappointing well describes it.If you liked this you will enjoy reading the sword in the stone and the once and future king.
3,Just read the last chapter.,"After reading all four books in The Once and Future King, I was eager to read The Book of Merlyn. But the book scarcely mentioned the characters found in TOFK; instead, White strays off on tangents and writes endlessly and blantantly his anti-war political views. The very last chapter--about 8 pages-- actually finishes the story by telling what becomes of Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and the rest. I wonder if anyone calling this book ""stunning"" has actually read it. I read the whole book, but really only got something from the last chapter. It is well written, but has little to do with Arthurian Legend. Not ""exciting conclusion"" here, just passive political commentary."
2,Wrong Color,"I could have bought the Red Logo here 5 days ago but wanted the White Logo,,, guess what they sent the red ones."
1,True Lies indeed - a total ripoff,"The other review is intirely correct. I wish I had kept the receipt for this.Not only are none of them anamorphic, Predator is indeed pan-and-scan. When you start the movie, it even give you the ""This filmo has been modified to fit your TV screen"" disclaimer. It then goes in to be one of the worst looking DVD transfers I've seen.there should seriously be a class action lawsuit for this release, because all of the DVD packaging says ""Anamorphic Widescreen"" on each disc. Not only is is not Anamorphic, Predator is not even Letterboxed! Not that that would make me happy.These movies are simply not watchable on a widescreen television, and a waste of money.This is false advertising, plain and simple, and someone should be held responsible."
1,It's True and I Ain't Lyin',"Once again, FOX deceives us with non-anamorphic copies while the box AND the individual cases clearly state ""anamorphic widescreen"". Before FOX got hold of MGM/UA releases they were at least marked either ""WIDECREEN 16x9"" or ""LETTERBOX"" so you knew if it was anamorphic or not. Now they are all marked ""WIDESCREEN"" and the aspect ratio with no anamorphic designation even if they are! The recent Bob Hope and Elvis movie legends collections are examples where some were and some not but you didn't know until you popped them in the player. Good thing I got this VERY cheap but this kind of deceptive (or downright false) packaging is inexcusable."
5,An extraordinary book about an extraordinary man!,Just as the title says; I believe the others who have reviewed this book have done it justice with their praise. Roy Boehm is an extraordinary man and his story suffers from no shortage of excitement. The book itself is also top knotch; no excessive drawl to take away from the story. Read this book! You will NOT regret your purchase!
5,Bratz Rock!,"At first I didn't want to get this toy because I was getting the Bratz spa and the spa has a salon in it, but after i looked at it I wanted so bad! It's really cool, it comes with alot of neat accessories too! But don't buy this for some one under 8, because there are many small parts. Otherwise don't think about buying it, buy it, you'll like it!"
2,"Some good tips, but too preachy..","I was expecting a bit more from this book and was disappointed to read many ""preachy"" passages like. ""pagans should bathe"" ""pagans should keep their life in order"" etc etc etc. I don't feel most people (adults) need to read and be told to bathe in a book about paganism. There are a few good tips but for the most part the author is preaching to us like our mother's would do when we were children. I recommend finding a book that spends more time explaining the history of paganism and the many different pagan cultures and beliefs. This book is more focused on wiccan and doesn't explore much into other pagan groups."
4,Nice expression,Wonderful bookThis is recommended to new folksThings explained pretty nicelyvery good for new folks like me who need all the help they can get on
3,almost perfect,"Audrey Roberts' life falls apart in the first chapter. She recovers it of course and finds the man of her dreams. Normally I hate romances but this was different. Ms. Palfrey writes beautifully and this is deeply moving story. My only criticisms are about the sudden shift to the secondary romance between the two supporting characters. Their romance seemed to be contrived and I skipped over the chapters that were wasted on them. Also, the problem of Malcom, the no good son is never answered. Did he decide to grow up? Did he decide to get a job? You never find out. Other than these little hiccups I loved the book and will be buying more novels by this author."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"After reading The Price of Passion, I wanted to read all the books written by this author. But, Dangerous Dilemmas is not what expected it to be. I don't think she spend enough time on Sam. I think she should've told MaryBeth and her children the truth. That would've made the story more interesting. I'm not going to let this one book discourage me. I would like to know if anyone can help me get a copy of Three Perfect Men...."
1,nope my kids love freedom nice try.,this book is again another one of bills ways to teach rinoisism to the youth. my kid wanted to read it. I read it first and found it to be nothing i want my freedom loving children reading.
2,The Factor For More Money,"I could present this book with a serous analysis, but even the fair and balance New York Times ignores O'Reilly books in their review section. Bill being this untimate pitchman should check the demographics for his show. It would demonstrate that the average age for the No Spin Show is over seventy years old. Which is why is his ratings are declining this past year, his viewer are dying of natural cause. I suggest his next book be titled ""The O'Reilly Factor For Nursing Home Residents""."
4,From a kid...,"First of all, anyone who hasn't actually read this book and has picked it up in a bookstore/library and skimmed through it shouldn't talk trash about it. I might add that I am 13, perhaps the only actual kid giving a review for a kids book (anyone else find that odd?) I've also read ""No Spin Zone"" by O'Reilly. Don't think I've been raised to like O'Reilly or something, weird it may seem, but I've read ""Dude, Where's my Country?"" by Micheal Moore and Fahrenheit 9/11 is my favorite movie/documentary. Anyone looking to buy this book for their kid and not just take shots at O'Reilly should look at the select few people that gave this book 5 or 4 stars. They all seem to have actually read it. Now direct your attention to the 50-60 people who gave it 1 star. Note: They haven't bought the book, and they are not in the target audience! What position are they in to critisize it? This is a great book to try to get kids more informed about our society."
1,Please Save Us,"As if his book for adults wasn't bad enough. I saw this in the bookstore and looked through it...garbage! I pity the poor child who gets this for their birthday. O'Reilly should stay out of children's literature, or better yet, literature in general."
1,Why Would ANYONE Buy and Read This Book?,"Although I have not read this book, I knew it would be a ridiculous waste of money to buy it as well as an infinitely waste of time and effort to read it when it first came out. Why? Because although he has a young daughter, Bill O'Reilly has no real practical experience of his own when it comes to raising teenagers. What in-depth insight or advice could anyone expect to get from a man who has no experience or education regarding such an area? Moreover, Bill O'reilly has an incredibly simplistic outlook on life in general, and tends to see everything in black-and-white and with little profundity. Alternatively, I suggest reading something by someone with the proper education and sufficient practical experience in this delicate area, like Dr. Joyce Brothers, for example."
3,"Average...(Sorry, Bill)","I'm one of Mr. O'Reilly's biggest fans and I got this book for my 14 year old son, but both of us found the book lacking in substance. Sure, there was basic advise, but it ended up being more 'fluff' than true advice. I assumed it would be packed with great information, but it wasn't. One could almost read the book in one sitting."
2,GOP Propaganda,"While reading this, I found myself wondering -- is this how the North Koreans teach their children to hate Americans? Do they have their children read political propaganda at an early age to indoctrinate them into a particular ideology?That's what this book is -- a well disguised indoctrination into the Republican party/Conservative movement.If you want to raise children who think for themselves, steer clear of political propagandists."
1,A Milestone In The Decline OF Western Civilization,"Future generations, savvy enough to know better, and with the benefit of hindsight will see this book for what it is: A testament to the vile and repugnant FOX News and it's extendend network of miscreants - and hopefelly, we'll all have a good laugh about it.Because, really, what else is there to do but laugh?... I mean, The Factor for kids? Flummoxing beyond words."
2,Uninspiring,"Here we have an example of an author who has risen in prominence due to gone good UK marketing, eye catching covers and the success of `Fear'over here. I very much enjoyed Fear and thought Paranoia was okay, so when I saw this cheap, I jumped in..Black Jack Point is a thriller based on a blend of murder, bad guys and a treasure hunt. Elderly couple killed discovering treasure hunters and the story and characters twist around in circles from that point.I must say that there are obviously previous novels to feature local JP Whit and his chums and I have not read them and that may be a reason that I did not enjoy this. Far too many characters and a tired old plot with not that many thrills made this a bit hard to churn through and I have to confess I was quite relieved when I finally completed it.Not recommended."
1,Spare me!!!!!,"I can truly say that after watching CreepShow 3? I could not wait to get this crapfest out of my house. I then watched the originals so as to wash the rancid taste of the third one out of my mouth. CreepShow 3 is not fun, not scarey, not even funny. It is just horrible. Badly written and badly acted to the point that I am embarassed to see this movie bear the name CreepShow. STAY AWAY!!!!!"
1,"Wow, this movie really sucked.","Why? Why do I keep doing this to myself? Why do I buy movies before looking up reviews online?I saw this in the store and said, ""Oh, Creepshow 3? I loved the first one and the second one was alright, I'll pick it up.""Big mistake. BIG MISTAKE.This film is atrocious. The acting is horrid and the stories are nonsensical. Being the masochist that I am, I actually sat through the whole thing. I almost turned it off when the story started with the doctor who was haunted by the street vagrant because he gave him, wait for it, a bad hot dog(I wish I was making this up). Luckily that was the final story of this abomination.To all those out there even thinking about buying this because you liked the first two films, DO NOT BUY IT."
5,Why the Bad Reviews?,"I LOVED this movie. It has bout 3 or 4 Stories in it, and they are all connected in some way. I Loved all the stories, except for the 1st one, because it was just stupid. What i love about this one, it has some humor in it, and kinda reminds me of Tales Of The Crypt. I Don't Understand why this has so many bad reviews for. I think it is better than the first 2."
2,Not Good And Not Creepshow,"When I saw this movie in the video store I was really happy. I thought King and Romero are doing it a third time. This movie has to be good. WRONG! This movie is not good at all. There is one story that is even decent. The rest, bad bad bad. If you are a die hard creepshow fan and you find this movie really really cheap ""like 1 to 2 dollers"" fine, pick it up if not, dont even bother. I am not going to tell you about the stories because they are not worth telling about get Creepshow 1 and 2. Not this one."
3,Great pants with flawed pockets,"I cannot really add much to what most other people have said about the pants in general - they are very comfortable. I rated them at a three, however, because of the inconvenience of the problem with the front pockets - this is my greatest complaint. The bottoms of the front pockets taper down and get quite a bit smaller. I keep my wallet in my front pocket and it gets stuck in the bottom of the pocket. I have to use two hands to get it out. That is a MAJOR annoyance factor. Want to keep two things in your front pocket? Good luck if they are bigger than a cassette tape. The pockets need to be as wide at the bottom as they are at the top."
2,not satisfied,"pros: made in USAcons:1. one piece at the bottom is longer than the rest. w/out any tool, we had to use our ""biggest"" knife to chop it(sign). if we had not painted it we'd already returned it. the reason for painted it b/4 assembly was reading all the positive reviews.2. too tall. i think it's made that tall so you'd have to purchase those boxes to fill underneath it. but it's just my opinion. my 1st plan was to put my 2yrs. old son on it. now, of course got to find a plan B.3. Look plain. very plain. very very plain.One of my few very bad purchases from Amazon."
1,Buy another chair,"The Carolina Cottage Folding rocker came today and what a let down. The wood on the arm was cracked in several places, from green wood being used. It is also sloppy feeling when sitting in it. The chair sent to me is not worth $20. Don't let the Caroline name fool you. It is made in China and is as cheap as a Chinese Christmas toy. I called the company directly to complain and put in a return for a refund with Amazon. I should have known it was junk since there were not any reviews. Hope this helps anyone else in the market for a folding rocker."
3,Agnetha is ok but Frida is better.,"I bought this cd, and i have listened it for several times.Agnetha has good songs, but they're so slow and all talk about love and things like that.Frida, is realistic, and she has better songs.All the major hits by ABBA were sang by Frida(Dancing Queen: Agnetha & Frida, Knowing Me, Knowing You: Frida).Agnetha sings in most ABBA songs, but Frida sings in the better songs."
2,room for improvement,The first third of the book has quite a bit ofrepetition. Perhaps this was an attempt at establishinggreater breadth but it just comes across as loosely structuredprose.Maybe the editor could have taken a cue from Cantor and deletedthe middle third of the text in which the author gives a ratherwatered down version of the proof for incompleteness - thusfailing to live up to the book's subtitle.The final part deals with some of the personalities aroundGodel at the institute and - having finished with the moretechnical material - makes for an easier read.
2,Brothers in Blood is a Bore,"Author Ken Englade uproots Jean Benoit from his post at Fort Laramie, Wyoming and sends him to Fort Macy in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Unfortunately, left behind are his wife Inge, friends Jace, Ashby, Erich and everyone and anyone else the reader has grown to care about over the sequence of events in this series of the old West. After attempting to get interested in a collection of priests and misfits, I must admit to giving up on this book and moving on to Comanche Trail, by Will Camp. I have no idea why someone else has picked up the story, but it at least gets back to the original characters"
1,Good idea not ready for prime time,"Enjoy being awash in a hideous bright post-apocolyptic orange glow while being blinded by the beaming element. Also, the heated area just didn't live up to the specs which, even if it did, would not overcome the downside of being turned orange. It really didn't heat anything but seemed to just barely keep the cold air at bay. Yes, I mounted it height and angle-wise according to the recommendations in the manual. Just thought I should give fair warning to any others."
2,Works ok until it doesn't.,"We have a MAgnavox 32MF337B LCD tv bought in 2007. It worked ok, although the menus are inscrutible and the picture jumps from widescreen to full-screen arbitrarily. However, that was ok until one day it wouldn't turn on. The red 'standby' light would go on, and hitting the power vutton made it green for a few minutes and then it owuld go off. Calls to Magnavox were pointless (""Turn it off for 60 seconds and then turn it back on again""""That doesn't work? Ok take it to a service company""""We don't know which service companies are in your area."" We finally had to buy a new TV."
2,review,"I didn't listen to the book because it was abridged. I detest abridged books so I gave it away. Next time I will be more careful about what I buy, and examine the fine print before purchasing."
1,horrible book - unless you really are OK to read lots of rape,"I have read many of the Prey series, but this was awful. There was no way to come up with an end that was even close to being acceptable. I guess authors now seem to feel they need to include very brutal psychopaths who love torture."
4,More Information than METALLICA UNBOUND,"I first read METALLICA UNBOUND, but that book did not give out enough information...But THIS book does.It goes into legnth about the death of Cliff Burton, hiring Jason to play bass, and life on the road. It also discusses life in the studio in great depths. If your a DIE-HARD Metallica fan and own the UNBOUND book, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.. Not as nicely put together as UNBOUND, but the facts and knowledge that went into writing this book is top-notch ! HIGHLY recommended !"
3,A vegetarian lion? Come on!,"You know, I really want to be able to endorse this book. The illustrations, quite colorful and appealing, though infantile and lacking detail, are pretty cute--especially the young cheetah in distress--and they carry the book, coupled with the fact that the story is told in rhyme. You just can't beat a rhyming book with good meter! I just draw the line where a seemingly possible story strays into the realm of impossibility. What does a young vegetarian lion eat? This point is not addressed. I categorize this book with ones like ""The Rainbow Fish"", in which authors seem to try to brainwash our children into accepting some sort of utopian ideal of living in harmony with the universe. The problem with this idea is that it simply does not work in practice. It's a nice goal toward which to strive, but the nasty reality is that in today's world, it's the fastest, strongest, and meanest lion who gets to be king of the pride."
1,title,got this and wont work in my camera..... but did work for another product.... it was a good price
4,Good for do-it-yourselfers,"I'm happy I bought this smoker b/c I always had the intention of adding a lot of my own modifications. If you want something that works great out of the box then this probably isn't the smoker for you. First of all, it needs to be assembled. The process isn't particularly complex but it is laborious and took me 3-4 hours. Beyond that, the work I feel needs be done includes; making the side fire box and cooking chamber airtight, installing thermometers that aren't junk, drilling air holes into the side fire box, putting on better wheels, adding tuning plates, extending the chimney down to the cooking grate level, adding a temperature probe grommet, raising the fire grate... Granted, some of these mods can be skipped without sacrificing cooking results (The wheels and grommet for instance) but the rest are necessary. Sounds like a lot of work but in the end I'll be $350 all in and will have a smoker that stands up to ones 3 times that price."
5,"Great smoker/grill, excellent baby back ribs","Length:: 6:54 MinsI really like this smoker, for the price it can't be beat. It's large enough to smoke a couple of briskets and still have room for other things. I like that it can be used as either a smoker or a grill. Char-Griller makes a really useful attachment for this line of smokers, it's a side burner that can be used to light the charcoal. I've had it for a couple of years and it just keeps getting better with age."
5,Versatile smoker/griller,"I have owned my Smokin Pro for over two years now and cook on it at least once or twice a week and i love it. You do have to make some mods for smoking the most important of which is buying or making a charcoal basket that is positoned high enough to send the smoke directly into the smoking chamber which enables you to use the ""Minion"" method, and purchasing a maverick digital thermometer to monitor the chamber temp and tell when thick pieces of meat are ready but this baby turns out good cue like clock work once you get the hang of it. I also hang my fire grate upside down to use as a baffle, and the adjustable fire grate makes it perfect for grilling dynamite steaks, fish, and chicken with the cast iron imparting flavor like nothing else. The only drawbacks are that it's not as air tight as i would like it, and the fire box rusts quickly but you can't beat this cooker for the price."
4,Long term owner,"I've had one since 2004 - and have literally wore the firebox out. I had to order a replacement today.What I have learned:If you operate it in the same fashion as a Weber Smokey Mountain, you'll have good results.Open the stack all the way.Open the firebox vent enough to get it up to 225.I also added a candy thermometer to the thing - the original isn't all that accurate."
2,Needs a better attachment method:,"---I was disappointed that the only attachment method was a large circular ""sticky back'--it severely limited where it could be placed and did not hold up to the sun on the dashboard. It is already falling off only a few weeks after the initial setup--at least if there was a suction cup, I could try reattaching--my stiletto looks like it will be falling off the dashboard within the week, and at this point I need to find a glue that will not damage my dashboard or try to duct-tape it on temporarily, which will probably permanently mar my dashboard!"
5,Stiletto 100 Car Dock,"The car dock works great; it powers the unit on and off with the ignition. So far, so good."
1,Has not performed to standards,"I had this professionally installed by Best Buy but could not get the dock to recognize the anntena after multiple attempts and even replacing the actual stiletto device, I can still not get this dock to work"
5,Just as I remembered,"I had this recording on 8-track tape back in the 70's. Until I found it here I had no idea how much I missed it. This CD takes me back to those years, listening with my Pappy to the Sons of the Pioneers, Jimmie Rodgers, Vaughn Monroe, and Homer and Jethro, and watching Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The Lone Ranger in black and white. It reminds me of folks that I wish were still here, and it inspires me to write about them and the stories they told. Marvelous!"
3,"Will keep, but...",For 50's-60's nostalgia really good. But found it a little slow. My main issue was the instrumentation which occasionally came close to drowning out the singers.
2,Cool Water,"I was disappointed in the audio, the voices didn't seem dynamic as I remember the music. These songs were classics, but on ehe CD the voices were weak."
4,ALMOST as good as Volume I,"I am a little more of a traditional scrapper: I use mostly 4x6 photos in square and rectangular shapes. Volume II uses many more enlarged photos which I rarely (if ever) use. I CAN adapt most of the sketches to accommodate my own style, so its working for me. However, I always check Volume I first!"
3,Not as good as the 1st one,This book is not as good as the first. It has some good ideas but it has a lot of pages with one huge picture which is not cost effective for most people that I know. I do like that the layouts have measurements.
3,A must for your library of JFK books:,"I had the good fortune to meet and interview Ron Lewis during the ASK conference in Dallas 1994. I found Ron Lewis to be very direct and honest. His story is worth reading. Ron has a document that could prove he was there in 1963, maybe he will print it in his next book. Bye John"
4,Entertaining novel,"Kazan draws from his own life and experiences in this entertaining novel set in the wilds of Broadway and Africa. He is a good writer who knows how to propel the story forward. If you read his autobiography before this novel, you'll recognize some of the scenarios. I am always impressed by Kazan's ability to critically self-analyze his motivations (both in his autobiography and in the novel's main character). This was the first of Kazan's novels that I read and I am going to read ""The Arrangement"" next.In his writing, I perceive a man striving for honesty and self-understanding. From a review standpoint, the book is fast-paced and rates 4 stars. If it had been more tightly edited in some sections, it would have rated 5 stars. Nevertheless, the two main characters are strongly drawn and unforgettable."
2,Disagree,"Unfortunately I cannot share the common appraising view of thisseries for several reasons. Firstly though I have to say that I Liked the humorous touch and can understand the point of view that this trilogy is not intended to be taken totally seriously. Unfortunately this is soured by the monotony of moving from one place to another again and again - after starting the third book every new locale seems to echo the others in the format of walk, fight talk and walk abit more with a few anticlimactic moments thrown in to lengthen the piece. Also the near total lack of character development leaves the reader feeling slightly ripped off at the end of the piece- this is what annoyed me most about this book, it contains minimum emotional involvement, a tired plot(magic gems and evil gods sound familiar to anybody out there?), and it gives the reader the impression of having wasted their time and money."
4,"Nice, not more","Well, well, well. Eddings, who deeply impressed me with his BELGARIAD and MALLOREON series is a little bit disappointing here. Everything is down a notch from the other two series. The book is a little bit too schematic, the characters are not as well drawn, but it is still very readable. At least the setting is a little bit different here, more focussing on a ""knight's life"". Another difference: There is a little bit more sex and violence in this book than in the other series. No! Hold your horses! Nothing steamy, it would still get a PG or PG-13 rating, we're still talking about David Eddings here..."
3,Uninspired showing from Eddings,"I've come to expect a lot from David Eddings. Those of his books that I have read, the Belgariad, Mallorean, and Belgarath the Sorcerer all had excitement, wonderful character interaction, and more than just a dash of humor.The first 50 pages were a joy to read. The book's main character, Sparhawk, appeared to be a singularly headstrong and arrogant character. His early conversations involved a lot of insults, and much of the bantering between friendly characters that has become a staple of Eddings' work. However, the story soon showed itself to be very unoriginal, and Sparhawk, along with all the rest of the characters, saw a sharp drop-off in distinctiveness as soon as he left the Pandion stronghold. The book was reasonably well-paced but rather unexciting overall. And as in most of Eddings' books, there is no character development to speak of.This book did not entertain me sufficently to make me buy the next one."
2,More of the same...only less interesting second / third time,"David Eddings needs an injection of creativity. Take all the ideas from the Belgariad, mix them around, and presto...this book and series. Take a bunch of characters and send them running all over a map. Very new idea.And this first book is all scene setting...from the prologue it was clear we were after this wondrous jewel...it took a whole book to get to this point.Sparhawk has been described as a great character by some people - his temperament is identical to Belgarath - a grumpy old man.The only action from this awesome hero is against weak opposition, and poorly described. Conversation between the characters is repetitive and tiring from the constant sniping...There are many examples of fantasy out there. Don't waste your time on an author with no new thoughts..."
2,Incomplete Overview of a Complex Topic,"Mr. Brady's book is a laudable approach to a subject that has been rarely documented. For a new public sector property manager it provides an overview of lifecycle activities, but little explanation or depth of discussion on any topic. For example, physical inventories are covered in a little over 4 pages and reporting and performance measurements are glossed over.The National Property Management Association (NPMA) published a book in 1999 called The Standard Property Book that provides much more information about the life cycle of property management. It is not limited to the public sector, but genericly is appropriate for anyone who manages personal property. Unfortunately, it is not available to the general public but can be acquired through www.NPMA.org. As the editor of the book, I admit to some bias but I suggest that anyone who would like additional information on the subject to check it out."
1,"Sucks, sucks, sucks!","Don't buy ANYTHING that uses Sony's crappy greedy proprietary ATRAC system! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!! I had a Sony MD that made you convert mp3's to ATRACS and I couldn't download mp3's off the net and listen to them no matter what I did! I download sermons from my church web site but thanks to Sony's greed they won't let me listen to them! This is going WAY too far! Just because Sony has such a large industry share of the music available, and they want to protect it, they will make buyers of their players jump through hoop after hoop to listen. I hope their greed comes back and bites them on the butt!!"
1,first time trying this product - not satisfied,It did not seem to help. Although it did not hurt or made worse the situation. I would not buy it again.
5,One of the best I've found!,"I teach a class on ""How To Write Your Life Story"" and have found that this book goes along with what I teach very nicely. This book is an easy guide for someone who wants to record their life story for family and friends. Several of my students bought this book as a supplement to my class. I highly recommend it!"
5,Exactly How It Stated,"This Product was Brand New, Never Used, Great Condition, Still in the Original Packaging. I had to open it to make sure it was the right scent that my mother always wore. This is a discounted item and hard to find anywhere. I was so thrilled when I found this item on the page. I will be buying more soon! Thanks a Bunch!I would trust this seller 100%; Very Reliable, and shipping came sooner then the estimated time!Thanks so much!"
