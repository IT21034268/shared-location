3,"Excellent quality, but more for the early beginner","I liked this video a lot as a practice companion, but have to say that the actual technique is more for the early beginner in the dance. There is also very little technique taight. You only learn moves that are utilized in the choreography and a little more layering at the ""intermediate"" level I think would be more appropriate. I liked the choreography, but again, it was below the intermediate level of the dance and lacked the drama of the selected music piece. I don't think the choreograohy and the music ""meshed"" all that well together. All in all, Jillina is a very effective and technically advanced teacher (which is made obvious by her performance pieces at the end) and the production of the video itself is excellent."
5,Excellent,Belly dancing with Jillina is an excellent dvd that teaches how to belly dance in a fun way!
3,O.K Album,"This album is good, but why are the two guys who hate it from the same small town in Finland?"
4,A pleasure to have a knockbox,"Always wanted one like the baristas. Makes it much easier to make multiple shots (esp for the S.O). Heavy enough. Easy to clean. But, the rubber peace on the crossbar slowly wears out (after about 2 years of heavy use). I am looking for a replacement, or perhaps I will just use heat shrink used for electrical projects. Highly recommended."
3,I didn't find it that helpful,"This book is essentially a primer on the basics of how to notate music by hand, meaning how to draw noteheads, space things, etc. It does not contain information on score layout, terminology, etc. that are also essential to notating a piece of music. For instance, it will tell you how to draw a fermata, but not the common practice rules for how and where it should appear in an orchestral score and parts. Since I was looking more for these specific rules rather than for the basics, I was disappointed with the book."
4,Top-Notch Entertainment,"One of the best movies I've seen of its kind. Actually, 4 & a half stars in my estimation - just a little bit shy of perfect in all aspects. Very Good entertainment!!!"
3,If you're a big Hulkster fan,"If you like to laugh at Hulk Hogan, you'll love this movie. Hogan is pretty ridicoulus, too bad that we dont see him in ALL the scenes. It's a kid's movie for sure, but if you like bad movies starring wrestlers, this one is for you."
4,Hail 'Saten' a.k.a Brian Keene,"I liked Brian ""Saten"" Keene's stories so much that I wanted them to be longer, and this is the only reason I gave the book four stars. He has a clear voice, a distinctive in-your-face style, and original ideas. For someone who says he never went to college, he writes more intelligently than some graduates I know."
4,Pyle work great,The Subs have a great clarity to them. I believe this is the best set i have ever had. AMAZING.
4,PYLE 10 INCH BASS SPEAKER,"THIS IS A WELL BUILT SUB. QUALITY APPEARANCE AND MATERIALS. I PUT ONE IN A CUBIC FOOT SOCHIE WEDGE CARPETED SEALED BOX. I CAUTION THAT PYLE TENDS TO THROW WATTAGE NUMBERS AROUND AND BUMP THEM UP IN EVERYTHING THEY MANUFACTURE, SO DO NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBERS. I DOUBT THIS SUB CAN TAKE 1000 WATTS RMS WITHOUT EXPLODING, BUT FEED IT 200 CLEAN WATTS AND THE BASS IS GOOD. IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET, THIS SUB WILL ADD THE MISSING BASS YOU NEED IN YOUR SOUND SYSTEM."
5,nice speaker for a great price,the subwoofer came early very fast shipping and for free shipping what a great deal.love doing business on here.the speaker is very loud in a bandpass box so for these size 10s i would recommened that kind of box.my whole car shakes off of one connected to an 800 watt 2 ch amp.30 bucks for the speaker and it looks really nice.gonna get another one.if you have an expedition like i do a bandpass box with ports facing up behind 3rd row seat bump very loud and doesnt take up that much space.
4,Another Great Warhammer 40k Novel,"If you are truly in love with the dark world of Warhammer 40k universe, you will love this novel. One little gem that is tossed in here is how a space marine is created, from being recruited til the time that he is specially fitted for his armor so that he can serve his Emperor.The gist of the novel is that a Space Marine goes off to fight for his Emperor and during the course of battle has to go into hibernation. When he wakes up he finds out that he has been asleep for 10,000 years and that the Choas Lords rule the universe, or so he has been told."
4,"Wow! Gritty, original, grab-you-in-the-guts story-telling!","The great thing about Warhammer (40k or otherwise) is its rich history - so rich it's almost painfully real. It's so hard to find originality these days, but Eye of Terror succeeds on many aspects. Although the different plot threads could be knitted together a little closer, Bayley's story remains a wonderfully spectacular read. Spectacular in the sense that the scale of Eye of Terror's world (i.e Warhammer 40K) is so microscopically imaginative (that drink comes to mind), yet so macroscopically shattering (that drink's essence! Or the scale of the daemons! the wars!). I must confess I only have passing knowledge into the Warhammer 40k world, so perhaps I'm gawking - but hey, I gawked! That's worth at least four stars!"
5,A Chicago Area Favorite - Excellent Windy City Original Rock,"Having enjoyed / endured the company of a ""delicate flower of the south"" for several years helps me appreciate Mr. Blotto's ""Southern Woman"" as featured on this CD.But you don't have to have that memory to enjoy the crisp vocals and smooth guitar on each and every song on this great collection.This album is a good introduction to the original music of Mr. Blotto for those that have not enjoyed their music in the past.Warning: If you put this CD in your car stereo, it may not come out for some time."
4,My review of Goodnight Loving Trail,I just bought this book and have had a hard time putting it down. The characters were believable. Luke and Tish have a very passionate relationship that makes your pulse race. My only dissapoinment is that I have finished the book. It's a story you want to go on and on. I now have to find out if all of Faye Adam's books are this good.
4,Perfect to take on a long plane ride,"Ms. Solomon has a way of keeping you riveted to the pages and feeling the emotions of her characters. Edge of your seat type suspense,a creepy obsession that will have you wondering if finding out the truth really is worth it, and a new twist to the familiar plot. It's not the type of story that will stay imbedded in your memory as a great read, but it is ideal for keeping you entertained for a short time."
5,A great read,This was a great book. I couldn't put it down and stayed up most of the night reading. The suspense had me hooked. The characters were very real. I even have a little crush on Finn Carver. I'll definitely be watching for more books by Annie Solomon.
4,Good Starter MP3 Player,"Good sound, nice price, held about 32 of my songs. Runs on 1 AAA battery.No pocket clip, display or Fast forward, ear buds are kinda large, But well worth the 17.10 I paid.Starts where you left off after being turned off."
1,<<NOT AN EVERYDAY USER>>,I had it for about 3 months and it finally started skipping non stop so I got a new one but not the same brand. Dont drop it a lot and be careful where you put it
2,Stopped working after about 10 minutes!!,It might be something wrong with the USB power and unit on at the same time. I needed to return for a refund.
3,good MP3 player for the kids,"It has a decent memory, is not difficult to figure out and fairly small in size. You also don't have to worry about losing it because a new one definitely won't break the bank. The ear buds are all but useless, but there are hundreds of aftermarket buds that are likewise rather inexpensive and far better. I bought 3 for my kids aged 6, 6, and 4. They love them and have no problem using them."
4,OLD FASHION ROCK,TRACK LIST: 7 O'Clock/Man On The Loose/Whippin' Boy/Sex Party/Sweet Mary Ann/I Don't Love You Anymore/Hey You/Misled/Long Time Comin'/Roses & Rings/There She Goes Again/Take Me HomeThe lead singer has the same raspy voice of Rod Stewart. The rock beats reminds me of the early Ron Stewart when he was still cool and hadn't sold out to disco. Just don't look at the cover while listening to the music.
2,disappointed,"Zared, the books herione, has grown up with a family fued against the Howards. For protection, her brother's have dressed her as a boy and trained her to fight and hate the enemy her whole life. Tearle Howard has grown up in France away from the fued and when he meets Zared he's immediately interested in her for the woman he sees beneath boys cloths. The feud complicates their getting together, but in the end Tearle finally breaks through Zared's barriers to win her love.I've liked Jude Deveraux novels in the past (The Duchess, Knight in Shining Armor) but I have to admit I was disappointed with this book. The story never seemed to [pull] me in and I found myself reading just to know how it ended. I even wondered why Tearle liked Zared at all. She was so filled with hatred and seemed incapable of showing him even the slightest bit of kindness.This is a book to skip."
5,Beautifully sung and illustrated!,This book is faaaaarrrrr out! My grandson has the benefit of two grandmas who love John Denver's songs and all he stood for and now this book is one of three (so far)which we can share in joy with the next generation.
1,Good as an Expensive Bike Stand,I should have read the reviews before purchasing. The Trakstand Mag has little resistance even at the tightest setting. I am returning it to the store today. Buyer Beware.Blackburn Trakstand Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer
3,Product not suitable for serious cyclists,"I bought this item to train during the week in order to improve my weekend rides. It simply doesn't have enough resistance for me to improve hills and wattage output that I need. I have cranked up the resistance to 3, applied maximum pressure to the tire and put the bike in the hardest gear. It makese a terrific noise and I can smell burning but resistance doesn't mimic what I get out of a spinning bike which is what I expect / need. Perhaps I was expecting too much."
3,kinda tiny,"this pearl necklace was smaller than i thought it would be. obviously i should have measured what 8 or 9mm looks like. also, my necklace came round, not oval shaped as advertised. it's still nice, but not what i expected. if i had seen it in person instead of on the computer, i probably would not have purchased it and kept on looking for a larger, truly oval shaped necklace like i thought i was getting. it's still attractive."
3,"""Your all purpose guide"" ???","I fell for the ""Your all purpose guide to this versatile investment vehicle"" and the title ""A complete guide to trading electronically"".It was a good book about the different exchanges but seemed to be more a history lesson than trading guide. If you want to know basics about the exchanges then it may be a good book. If you are looking for a nuts and bolts direct access futures trading book then keep looking.I did enjoy the book, it just wasn't what I thought it would be based on the reviews."
3,The Pre-Golden Age Returns... kind of,"During the big explosion in popularity of science fiction during the early 1950s, August Derleth edited several science fiction anthologies. Here, found in his files, is the final, hitherto-unpublished anthology that he assembled. The stories collected range in original magazine publication date from roughly 1915 to 1945, with the emphasis on the earlier dates. Authors include such stalwarts as Murray Leinster, David H. Keller, Stanton Coblentz, and A. Hyatt Verril. The best stories are in the general Gernsback-magazine genre of ""inventions gone awry,"" by a couple of obscure authors I had never encountered before.I found the introductions and comments by someone named Wrzos fairly annoying. Because he doesn't write in complete sentences. Like this. Makes the reader breathless. You know?This final Derlethian netful of pre-Golden-Age science fiction certainly merited publication and I read it in one sitting."
3,A lot of money for not much book.,"This book sold in the mid 90s for $20 or so. It's been out of print a long time and any copies that become available usually command $100 or more. I got very lucky and found one with many wrinkles for $40. The information provided could easily have been produced in a web page. I'm not sorry I bought the book but I'm sure glad I didn't pay $100 for it. I wish they had provided more information as to construction methods, photos from inside the factory, interviews with current or former employees, anecdotes about the factory, production figures, dimensions, oddities, things like that. It seems they spent a lot of time on artist endorsements with a little technical fluff here and there."
4,"Where's Waldo, but with Elvis","I bought this book for a friend who is an Elvis fan and now wish I had bought a copy for myself. It was a clever idea, with pictures of Elvis on the moon, in a crowd of hippies, etc."
2,disapoointed,This item did not perform as expected on carpet. Also was charged for restocking and shipping when it was returned.
4,Fearless FBI - Agent Moore,"This is the second book in the Fearless FBI series. I suggest reading book one first if you're interested in this book.This continues on where the first book left off. Gaia Moore is still training to be an FBI agent and things continue to get steamy with Will, one of her partners. Gaia and anothr partner Christina are given temporary agent IDs so they can work on the case, the murder that they caught right after it happened, the end of book one.I can't wait for book three, Agent Out, to come out."
3,Dixieland Sushi...falls flat,"I really enjoy Cara's books and I expected this one to be just as good as her previous ones. I was wrong! I couldn't get past the second chapter as the book was just non-sensical and didn't appeal to me at all. It just seemed like random, jumbled thoughts and comments were thrown onto pages and labeled a novel."
5,Great Fun,This was a great book to work through with a young child (4yrs old). The book was in great condition too.
5,Niagara Cycle,I have had great success getting my tires from Niagara Cycle Works and they work wonderfully.Thanks so muchDiane Willis
5,"Disneymania 1, 2, 3",It's perfect!! If you like another disneymania album you will love dismemania 2!
1,Not Disney's Best Work...,"This CD is a far cry from the first Disneymania CD. Since the Disney corporation feels that everyone that has a show on the Disney Channel is a singer as well, this CD is not their best work. To shift from respectable artists (and I use that term loosely), such as NSYNC, Ashanti, and Christina Aguilera, and go to ""Disney Channel-made artists,"" like Raven and the Duff sisters, in my opinion, is a mistake. If your kids are into all the shows the Disney Channel has to offer... the CD is a fair choice. Otherwise, stick with the first Disneymania CD and don't waste your money on this one."
2,"Doesn't live up to its ""comprehensive"" promise","I think Adobe expects users who already know something about Photoshop to get another one of their books. It seemed like most of the stuff covered in this book was substantially covered in the Tutorials included with Photoshop 4. I should say that I have NOT read this book; I ordered it, flipped through it, and am now returning it."
2,Not what I expected,"Gave me severe headache's and I did not lose any weight. I will not purchase this product again, I will look for something without caffine."
1,Traumatized nervous system; interfered with my coordination; made me retch,"This is really a caffeine pill but I didn't know it because the word ""caffeine"" is not legible on the label. So I made the mistake of taking this pill later in the same morning that I drank my usual quota of coffee.The key ingredient is caffeine anhydrous. The label shows this in an illegible manner but as soon as the nausea hit me, I looked it up on the product website. It had me heaving. It was like being sea sick only with my hands shaking.My experience from taking one pill was extremely unpleasant. I can't imagine how this pill is going to enhance one's workout."
3,It just makes me too jittery,"My best friend's husband swears by Hydroxystim so I was taking that for a while with no appreciable results, so given an opportunity to try Hydroxycut, I took it. The amount of caffeine in Hydroxycut is significantly more than the Hydroxystim and even just taking one I turned into a hyper mess. My friend could tell when I took it or didn't. And no noticed of losing weight. If I took 3 pills, I'd probably be in cyberspace and not need to ever eat and would lose weight. Ok. kidding. All in all, I'm not excited about these pills and can not say they helped me."
2,new adaptation of accepted product,"The original Hydroxycut worked very well till the Feds had them take the guts out of it. Since then, Muscle Tech has been playing around with various replacements (and levels of caffeine). I have used several of these products, and have been generally satisfied with the results (stacking with other products, it should be noted). This version ""hardcore elite"" is the first to actually keep me up at night if I take it after 3 or 4 pm, leading me to believe the caffeine or related product is on time release delayed that long. I'm no expert, but simply my own empirical experience has me preferring previous Hydroxycut products more."
5,muy bueno,el vendedor muy responsable el producto llego sin detalles sellado tamaño pedido llego en la fecha acordada se lo recomiendo 100%
4,"Muscletech Hydroxycut Hardcore Pro, Liquid Capsule, 210-Count","i like it alot and is good. Muscletech Hydroxycut Hardcore Pro, Liquid Capsule, 210-Count is the best for ppl like me... THANK YOU.."
1,No Results except sickness,"I followed the instructions on taking the pill and I had terrible headaches, jitters, and a feeling of a lack of control. I could not concentrate at work. (bad). I thought well this is just my body getting used to the pills. After 3 weeks and continuously feeling like I had the flu, there was no way I could continue. I lost no weight with this actually I gained 10 pounds. My food intake was down but for some reason I gained instead of losing. I would not recommend anyone taking this pill."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Following the directions I used the complete contents of the bottle. I could definately feel the thermogenics working. I became hot and sweated. I did receive some energy boost too, though nothing substantial. I had no problems sleeping at night. As far as any weight loss, I did not notice any, which is what I was hoping for, even a little. So, yeah, I'm a little disappointed."
2,Not sure this really works,"I have used the regular version of Hydroxycut and felt that it assisted me in a little weight loss effort. I don't really think that this worked for me, and don't recommend it other than it was at a good price. The caplets all seem to be dried out. Try something else."
1,Not to friendly,I wouldn't buy this product again it's really painful on the third day my side was burning and I felt nausea and I have a pretty strong stomach.
1,I've trashed the product...,"...after only a single recommended dose. Why? I experienced hypertension, dizziness, intense sweating, and other transient shock symptoms. In addition, the type on the label is VERY small, even under rather ordinary magnification. QED: check the ingredients and proceed with care and caution. If at all."
1,caution,I had bad side effects on the 4th day of taking hydroxycut. i have a mental disability and i take some medication to control some symptoms. you should check with your doctor before taking this.
3,Curves Appetite,"Although I didn't lose any weight, hydroxycut does curve your appetite. This product may have worked a little better for me if I didn't work around food all day! lol"
3,Very STRONG product - Keep that in mind.,"After using the older mixture years ago, I just had to try this one.Trying to follow the directions on the bottle, I noticed that I was jittery, feeling anxious, a odd almost dizzy feeling, and I felt so out of it that I couldn't even work out right at the gym that day. I plan on trying to do this with maybe one pill a day but then again, not sure if there is a point to that. So if you have a high tolerance to this kind of stuff, give this a run. I was trying the EC stack with 200mg of caffeine and I was OK. This brand has 270 per serving but you REALLY feel it. So if you are sensitive to caffeine, you might need to proceed with caution and see if you can get a sample first.Make sure you talk to your doctor first and be mindful of fake reviews people. If you see five(5) stars, a over positive review, and check their history and notice a huge amount of nothing but positive reviews on similar products. Its fake."
2,Too Hardcore,"I have taken Hydroxycut Hardcore in the past. This was the first time with the Elite. On Friday I was a normal 2-2-2 Hydroxtcut Hardcore.On Monday I thought it would be okay to go to 2 Elite then 1 in the afternoon...........WRONG. Only do the one. My system is jacked up from this stuff. Digestion, heartrate, attitude, etc....all have side affects. Not comfortable. I will stick with the regular Hydroxycut and leave the elite for those that can tolerate it.Discomfort, elite discomfort........."
4,Awesome energy!,I've been taking this product for just over 3 weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference but I also have to note that I'm using the product in combination with diet and exercise. The first day I took just one pill I did have pretty bad nausea but I kept drinking water and it went away after about an hour or so. After that I've kept taking only one pill instead of increasing my dosage and I've still been able to feel the effects of the increased metabolism and no longer feel negative side effects. Also I've only taken the pills during the weekday and gave myself a break on the weekends. In the three weeks I've taken the pill my weight has stayed the same but I've dropped about 3 inches and have noticed that clothes fit me better and my appetite has decreased. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a weight loss booster along with diet and exercise.
3,Strong Formula,This is a very strong product. I did notice some additional energy but do not take on an empty stomach. Even with food this has a tendency to make you feel nervous and jittery. I noticed no reduction in appetite or any help with weight loss. For the price and the effects I do not believe I would recommend this to a friend. I do like most of the Muscle Tech products but this one I believe is a waste of money.
2,Not for me,"I really think Hydroxycut will work, just not for me. It hit me with nausea and jitters. I had a massive headache when I worked out. I took 1 pill with breakfast, and 1 pill with lunch. I guess I should have started on the normal Hydroxycut and not the Pro Series.It did a great job with appetite suppression, just not the energy boost I was expecting. Because my friends saying it worked for them, I'm convinced it was just me."
2,"Well, it's not for me....","Couple things: 1.) It made my heart race and I felt as though I could punch a hole in the wall but I really didn't have that kind of energy; it was a felt energy rather than real energy. 2.) The next day I was raveous and tired. So, it was a two day experiment. I gave it up.The directions are clear by the way... it states to start with one capsule which I did."
3,FDA Recall? this is fail if i have to send it back.,"I am confused why this is even being sold on amazon or anywhere. The Hydroxycut Hardcore liquid capsules which is this make, was recalled by the FDA in 2009.Am I suppose to send this back now? It is now 2012, why would this be sold here if it were recalled 3 years ago.removed URL"
1,"dangerous product,dont take this","i come now from hospital.i took 2pills of this and a feel very bad,blood-pressure was very high.dont recomended it,doctor told me that dont take it again"
1,Did not work,I used hydroxycut in addition to exercise and eating a little better 7 years ago and had awesome results when I hit a plateau. I used both this and this series and the traditional one for several months and have had zero luck with either. When I first started taking them I was also jittery if I took them right before exercising but that stopped after a few days. Would definitely not recommend.
1,stomach cramps and bad feeling overall,"this product did not work for me from the beginning. Every time I took it gave me stomach aches, nervousness and made me feel cold all the time. I would not recommend at all. I have still a full bottle I just pretty much wasted my money."
1,Not For Me,"I'm one of those who cannot tolerate this drug. I've had terrible side effects after one dose including rapid heart beat, nausea, and vomiting. I've successfully used similar drugs in the past, but there must be something in this formula that does not react well to my body. To say the least. Never again."
5,Great ideas!,"I Love the ideas in this book. Something for everyone, from difficult to easy. Lots of style veriation. Great pics."
4,Complex Reference Tool,"I found this book to be very interesting, I found myself wishing that I could talk to the auther about her experiences in growing. I think an in depth description of each growing stage would be helpful but would make the book way too long....But isn't that what a reference tool should be?"
4,Brilliant guide!,"Excellent, detailed info. Gives me confidence to actually try saving my own seeds. One thing that was REALLY helpful for planning plantings for seed, was the breakdown by region - NorthEast vs. Pacific SW, etc. -- what is possible in one region, what isn't in another. Would have been nice if there'd been more photos."
5,seed to seed and nose to book,"Although I am an Antipodean reader, everything is applicable.Excellent descriptions and informative, easy to follow instructions.I am a member of our local Community garden and we have been growing artichokes. So I went straight to that item and spent the next hour finding the seeds, as it is harvest time Down Under. It was a lot of fun, especially showing other gardeners how to do it!Great!Thanksps Sorry I didn't quite make a seventy five word 'essay'. but we like to be succinct in OZ land!!!"
2,Complicated Data,As a novice; I have a problem putting to use the complex information in this book. It's good for the experienced.
4,Great but not for Suburbia,"This is a great, informative text on seed saving but it is not practical if you live on less than a quarter acre as many homeowners do."
2,Not impressed,"This book has infinite knowledge...that being said, its not written in a user friendly manner at all. Seems designed more for a large, very large farm with infinite vegetable growing on them. As excited as I was about getting this book, my enthusiasm for saving seeds diminished quickly :("
3,Not too bad,"I like that the plants are organized by botanical families, because this helps to understand matters of pollination, crossing etc. A bit more unusual vegetables are included as well.There is a bit more information than in the seed savers book, however, some information is only given for some plants like for example how many plants are necessary to have a sufficient genetic base.In some instances techniques are not explained very well and illustrative pictures are missing.The planting information for each species is only useful for those living in the US, and I think completely unnecessary, because you find it in any other gardening book.F are not converted as are measurements.All in all, the book is useful but far from outstanding."
4,Seems to be a Thorough Text (for an Inexperienced Seed Saver like me),"This book is a well organized text on seed saving techniques and viability record keeping. Sparce photos are Black and White. I recommend this to anyone starting out with serious interest in saving our heirloom heritage crops for the hobbyist, homesteader, or beyond.Consider the source, however. I've only preserved heirloom pumpkin, bean and tomato seeds, as well as done my own viability testing before buying this book. But I do feel that this book has taken my ""tinkering"" to a new level of confidence to attempt much more."
1,Its ok,It's a cool shirt to have. but it shrank after the first wash. now its just a collectors item. i recommend buying from an official retailers website. I bought on from Stylin Online and has not shrunk an inch.
2,listen before you leap,"I bought this after hearing Diana Krall's version of Crazy on NPR. There are some good renditions by Amy Grant ""Back in Baby's Arms"", of course K. D. Lang ""Leavin on your mind"" Terri Clark especially good at ""Walkin After Midnight"" and a pretty good ""Faded Love"" by Patty Griffin. Norah Jones is still terrific even if not a perfect match for her style. But, the first song by Natalie Cole is so poor that it unfortunately sets the tone for the whole album. Cole's voice is hoarse and otherwise dreadful. How could she lead off the album? Wrong choice for a Patsy Cline song. Martina McBride's attempt at ""Sweet Dreams of you"" is painful to listen to and the background music is a real turn off. What a shame, this could have been a great album with other artists."
2,Patsy Cline,"I was so disappointed with this CD. I bought it because I am a great fan of all the singers on the CD, but I realized no one can sing Patsy Cline like Patsy Cline. I am now listening to my favorite CD - Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits (it has all the same songs) and it only cost $7.99 in the bargain bin!! I have learned a valuable lesson - if you want to hear the real thing - buy the real thing - not someone's interpretation!!"
2,"""Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire""","Jayson Blair may still be active as a writer -- penning 5 stars reviews on Amazon, per chance? The book is full of lurid details of drug abuse as he chronicles his fall from grace at the NYtimes but short on insight as to why it happened, or shame that it did. Instead, what we get are a lot of self-serving rationalizations and finger pointing. Here the NYtimes is characterized as a kind of witholding parent who simply could not meet the many needs of Jason, while inadvertently enabling and perhaps even encouraging his bad behaviour. This is passing the buck at its worst. I suggest saving yours."
1,Piece of garbage writes book.,"How could anyone reward this piece of garbage? I read a few pages of this trash - loaned to me of course - and I found it nothing more than an excuse to blame others, use racism, and drugs as the reason that this garbage did what he did. I'm a vegeterian so I would never call him an animal, so for me, a piece of excrement would be the most just description. Perhaps he should become a nanny for Jessie's illegitimate child?"
1,The lies of a liar,"The ""victim"" approach is not acceptable when you're a discovered liar. This book is nothing more than an attempt to blame the entire Blair disaster on something or someone other than himself. His actions are because he is black, pressured, a drug user, depressed, etc. Reality should set in now, he did what he did because he is a sociopathic liar. If you want to read a book that gives you insight into nothing, this is a good choice."
1,Ick Ick Ick Ick Ick,"To say it is poorly written would be too much of a compliment. You don't have to get even halfway through before you can figure out exactly what happened here. Some publishing house obviously offered him a large advance to write a book, and he threw together whatever he could think of off the top of his head, very little of which is probably true, threw in some ""woe is me"" for cohesion, and tossed it onto the editor's desk. Whether or not anyone even tried to edit this thing, I don't know, but if they did, they should be fired. This is slop, worse than those celebrities who try to ""write"" books. To think of all the talented people out there who receive small advances and modest printings, while this thing has done better than it ever should have can make you sick to your stomach."
1,Poor prose from a supposed writer,"This is the closest I've come to being sorry I bought a book. For a NYT calibre writer I thought the book was rather poorly written, and more poorly edited. Some of the stories are fascinating, but you find yourself wondering if you are again being conned by a guy who seems hell-bent on blaming everybody and everything but himself.The most extraordinary thing about this book is how such a poor writer even got the chance to work at NYT."
3,"This is ""Just Wacky""--Same Book!","This only gets 3 stars because I want to get your attention: A little warning, This is the exact same book as ""Just Wacky."" My son loves these ""Just..."" books, so he wanted them all. ""Just Crazy"" proved to be a little elusive, but I discovered why, it's the original version of what came out in the US as ""Just Wacky""--same book, different title. However, I highly recommend them, especially to those who don't like to read because the books are filled with short, funny (and sometimes gross) stories with lots of cartoons and silly drawings in the margins. Just don't make the same mistake that I did, if you already have ""Just Wacky"" then don't buy ""Just Crazy"" (or vice versa)!"
4,The future of UK garage?,"This is the debut album by 18-year old Dylan Mills, otherwise known as Dizzee Rascal. Entirely written and produced by Dizzee, this is an impressive debut. It features some superb production, as well as serious lyrics that address his South London surroundings. There are some great tracks on here such as Sittin Here, Brand New Day and Fix Up, Look sharp. I haven't given it 5 stars though because i think that some of the tracks can get a bit repetitive, and his production style doesn't always work. Overall this is a good album though."
2,I haven't been this disappointed in awhile,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm not a novice to ""underground"" hip hop; I'm not an expert, but I've heard a few dozen of these abums over the years and I do like ""Orignal Pirate Material"" quite a bit. This was a massive disappointment. What do people see in this? It's not awful or anything, but there's not much to recommend it. Dizzee Rascal is a good rapper and sometimes he turns a good phrase. But the beats and the music are rudimentary and unimaginative. The production isn't very good, either. There's very little about this album that is memorable -- I've played it through four times, and almost nothing sticks. It's not like I need my music to be totally poppy, but less accessible music usually makes up for it by being experimental or complex, and this really is neither. It's just hookless, non-danceable background beats. Great. I really have no idea how this album got such positive critical attention."
1,Disappointing...Way too much Hype,"I'm a huge hip-hop fan with tons of albums. Simply, this sounds like a bad Southern lyricist rapping fast to crappy, harsh electronic beats. The last two songs on the album will give you a headache. There's no meaning in his lyrics either. It's the same ""I floss, I'm the greatest, I'm so rich"" attitude that prevails in most of crap rap nowadays.I really don't know why this guy is being hyped so much. The beats sound like they were put together by a mental defective on a school computer. What do you know? They were.Very disappointing."
1,This Book is in the Stone Age,I have this book and I have thrown it in the trash. It no more tells you how to overclock then a man on the moon. He give you computer history in the first part and then he talk about overclocking old computers. This book is seriously out of date but if you have a Pentium 3 or 2 or anything old its in there. But why overclock an old computer thats only going to give you a few extra MHz as I see it these old computers are only worth the price of gas to take it to the dump.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF #$@!*&^!,"I bought for using overseas (VCD), the picture is very bad, poor, poior quality, if you have a T.V. to plug it into then great! I also bought it for the zoom and slow motion features - AGAIN - buy it if you want to use it as a temporary and have an alternative T.V. screen in which to view. I have had issues with it freezing, but I gues once it warms up, it works. Some DVD's and VCD's work in my old DVD player, but do not play on this particular model...I do not recommend this for these reasons."
2,I have no sound..wanna trade?,Someone else here has no picture...well I have no sound. Sound works out of the headphone jack but not from the built-in speakers. We've had it for about 9 months and it's always been kept in a case and rarely moved from the back seat of the car. It does get VERY hot and you need to be careful not to just shut the movie off and close the top as it's really NOT OFF. It has no auto-shut off so very early on I discovered it would continue to spin away until you actually turn the physical switch off unlike a notebook computer etc. Also the controls are terrible in layout and design. Even the volume switch is reverse of the intuitive motion. When sitting in front of the unit you would think upwards is louder...not according to Magnavox designers! No up is down and down is up. Outstanding!
4,Straight Gangsta,"Yo 50 cent is straight gansta, I don't care what anyone says about his vague lyrics. The message is there. I don't listen to any rap on tv or the radio but 50 cent is true and you can feel his style"
4,"If you don't know yet, you will soon!","50 Cent can flat out flow! I would give this CD 5 stars, but I can't put it on the level with his forthcoming CD on Shady Records which is destined to be a classic. This CD is definitely a good example of a lyricist at the top of his game who doesn't care what people think of him. Get this at least to tide you over till his new CD drops."
2,Action + No real plot = Meh,"There wasn't much to it. No content really. Ok, so some guy gets in a suit and kills demons... Tell me when this doesn't happen in anime? I'm sure if I was Japanese, and spoke it, I would understand more of what was going on. I know a lot can be lost in translation for lack of an appropriate word in English. It wasn't worth buying, but if someone else has it and you're really bored, go for it..."
1,A Waste,I was super excited to try this toilet paper as we've been attempting to move to all recycled paper products in our household. This was a huge disappointment. A roll lasts less than half as long as a normal Charmin-type toilet paper roll. How is it helping the environment when they have to package twice as many rolls as a common type of toilet paper?
1,The worst ever,"This is the worst toilet paper I've ever bought. Packed loosely so it's soft, but so few tissues on the roll it uses up fast. It doesn't tear neatly, so there are bits left behind. And, it tears while wiping, nasty. Buy Seventh Generation instead."
2,Recycled paper but too much plastic,"It's good the paper is recycled, but the environmental effect is completely negated by all the plastic packaging. The quality of the paper is fine, but the rolls are small and loosely rolled. I really believe it would be better to purchase virgin paper, in large rolls, wrapped in paper than these little things wrapped in plastic. It just made me ill to see all the plastic around a little bit of paper. At least paper decomposes and grows again. I will choose a different brand next time."
3,Great Book if all you want to learn is SQL,"If all you are interested in doing is learning Personal Oracle basics and SQL, THEN THIS IS THE BOOK! But if you already know SQL, then don't waste your money.When I needed this book, I was trying to automate Oracle with Visual Basic and it did not help at all."
2,This book has no sense of organization,This is a pretty disorganized book by any standards. The author seems to have no sense of what he is trying to teach. It would have been so helpful if he had just had the reader create a project from scratch. Instead he jumps from from one topic to the next and then back again. If you want to learn Oracle dont buy this book. The best thing that I can say about this book is that it may serve as a solid reference after you have mastered Oracle.
4,Sing and Shout with The Georgia Mass Choir,"This album is wonderful. The song choice is great. Stand-out songs are ""Hold On, Help Is On The Way"", ""My God Said It"", ""Oh, What A Blessing"" and ""You Bring Me Joy"". The album is great for church and community choirs. The album is well-worth buying."
1,Awful supplement..do not buy!!!!,"The stuff for 3rd graders in this book is what my daughter did in Kindergarten. What a joke and a complete waste of time and money !!!counting by 5's , simple 2 digit additions...really?? I wonder which school's curriculum the author was following. Absolutely ridiculous !!!!"
2,Very basic guidance,"This book advantage relies on the examples of the ""examination questions"", which I found matching only a small percentage of the real test. It lacks main concepts and formulas. Worst test preparation material I've ever bought."
5,I remember loving it.,I read this book in 9th grade and remember loving it. I hope I can find a copy of it. It's left quite an image in my mind (which only really good books can do).
4,tour de force,Getting the CD due to both amazon and myself was stress full yet and still heaven or Las Vegas has a right full place in my collection phrasing like burn this house down is remensent of heart several tracks off course
5,"Spine Tingling, Breathless, & Astonishing Delicacy","Ethereal, timeless, haunting, mesmerizing, an indisputable melodic masterpiece that ascends time & space, the universe and the heavens...what more can one say."
5,A new 'Twins for a new decade,"I mean the last decade, not this one, although this recording holds up surprisingly well, considering that it has been 12 years since it was released. I remember first hearing this CD coming out of the jukebox at Vezzo's in Philly, thinking ""I gotta get this one."" It's the perfect CD for whiling away a quiet night. Ms. Fraser's vocals are sensual and inviting, the muscianship is excellent, and the lyrics are just on this side of being understandable, if not totally coherant. The 'Twins left thier Goth constituants behind with this one, foraying ahead with a style that seemed to invoke My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth, while eclipsing both of them in content. While ""Iceblink Luck"" seems to be the breakout hit here, there are also the title track and the first track as well. An essential CD for anyone who loves all that can be music."
3,A mix of heaven and Las Vegas,"I think this is a mundane version of previously heavenly Cocteau Twins. Much of the dreamlike quality in Treasure (darkly) and Victorialand (airily) is lost, and Blue Bell Knoll is a more emotionally powerful album. While the songs are still good and Liz's voice is still strong, the listener feels that he is simply listening to songs instead of being engulfed in a mystic atmosphere. There may be reasons to love the Twins' matured sound, but I am one of the people who miss their creative young days."
2,The annotated Weston,"There are two principal irritations here--first is the extensive quoting from letters and journals. Easily half the book. They interrupt any flow the book manages. Second is the tone, with the gratuitous generalizations and judgments sprinkled on almost every page, about psychology or about how great an artist Weston was. I have no argument with that, but why the repetition? The tone of the book is odd."
1,Don't buy it!,"I can't help but laugh at some of the reviews I've read. I guess most all agree with me that this is junk. We bought ours for our son in November of 04 and thought wew really had something. It worked well and we really liked it but then about six months later it wouldn't play dvd's. When you put one in it just grinds and won't stop enen if you open the cover, the only way to shut it off is to turn off the power. I can reflect the views of the company policies as well the were a joke. I can't believe that a supposedly good name brand of product doesn't protect its customer better than that. DO NOT BUY IT, ITS JUNK!"
2,Experts Only,"My family grew up in South Texas, and it's a good thing or the cookbook would not be very helpful. The recipes are what you would expect from South Texas, however the details needed to prepare these authentic recipes are simply not to be found in this cookbook. I also have the Tex-Mex Cookbook, and the San Antonio Tex Mex Cookbook, and both offer well written recipes which you can duplicate. I would only recomend this cookbook for nostalgic reasons, a much better choice would be the tex-Mex Cookbook, both historically and for the recipes."
5,Documentary,"This documentary film goes through the making of Off the Ground and through the world tour. They document photo shoots, video shoots, concert stage constructing and more. A must for any true Paul McCartney fan."
3,Not so perfect thrower...,"Came on date and was packaged nicely inside the box. Looked nice right out of the box with the exception of a scratch about halfway down the blade. I don't know why a new nicely packaged knife would have a scratch but then noticed it was quite dull. I took it out to throw and it bounced off the foam and when I went to retrieve it from the grassed ground, it was chipped on the tip! I was shocked after the reviews clamping it is indestructible and very upset. In the next 5 successful throws, it gained around 6 nicks on the dull blade. Very upset to have paid so much for it and hope (not counting on it) for some type of compensation... I enjoyed my 7 dollar Kunai knives as they withstood the same forces. Won't reccomend this to any friends..."
3,"Throws nice, broke one",5 people in my family were learning how to throw knives with this knife and took alot of abuse. 2 of them I still have the 3rd one broke and looking at the brake it appears it's been cracked for sometime. If you want a better throwing knife try the Gil Hibben Large Throwers.
1,Don't waste your money.,"It really is full of non-blooper material: just silly stuff for fillers, not SPORTS bloopers at all. The film co. was definitely trying to make a buck on you because there is a great lack of professional sports shown, which is what most people including myself would be automatically thinking."
4,Great experience even with a bad string,I bought this set for my girlfriend for Christmas. The product arrived and she took them to her repair shop to have her cello restrung. She generally waits and it takes 10 minutes. The tech showed her that the c-string was unwound. It had a flaw and the outer wind had delaminated from the center string. 3 strings were strung. So we can't take it back to Amazon. She called D'Addario just to swap the one string and they agreed to send her a new string if she would send back the old one so they could identify the flaw.I was surprised they stood by their product after another person said they would not. Good company. Great sounding strings. Satisfied customers here.
1,"It doesn't do a thing, not one thing","I purchased two of these to dry out my bathrooms, and neither one has done the job. There isn't even any water collecting."
4,"Imaginative, colorful and exciting","Wonderful fantasy film featuring terrific FX by Kochi Kawakita, the man behind the 1990s godzilla films. Based on legends of Shinto, this film is a fast paced adventure that will be sure to entertain. If you like the fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen, check this movie out.! The Lava Giant and 8 headed dragon are real highlights! so go buy this NOW!!"
2,Its Okay,"Item was okay. I had thought Danny Glover would do the reading in the traditional B'rer Rabbit dialect, which my grandchildren would enjoy."
2,"basic info, but difficult to see printed words","I'm a begining bellydancer & wanted something to give me some basic info in the history & culture of bellydance. This book does that.There is a lot of info in the book. My complaint: Some pages are very difficult to read due to the fact that the words are printed with a variety of colors onto background photos. I had read that comment in another review before I bought my copy, but didn't realize how much of the book was printed that way (more than half) & how difficult it would be to read (very difficult), make sure you have good lighting. Also the font size used is a little on the small side. Might have been easier to read with a larger font. Should be able to find same info in an easier to read format."
4,"Tippecanoe Place, South Bend, Indiana","Reading the book, Tippecanoe Place: A History, was very interesting and learning about the Studebaker Family who built Tippecanoe Place was quite informative."
5,Perfect Title,"What a great novel about friends getting together with good food and spirits discussing their experiences. A must read. Truly a page turner, I couldn't put Wisdom down. Karen thanks for a wonderful read."
4,Wisdom Thru Experiences,What a wonderful way to celebrate your 30th birthday ! Such was the case of Sharlisa and her sistah's of friends! Getting together and having a sistah's talk sharing past experiences and wisdom ! This was a wonderful story inwhich I enjoyed meeting each of the characters and the experiences each had to share ! There was a secret in one of the stories that I am sure you will not miss but will be amazed at what happened. Each of the characters will touch your heart in some way thru their experiences ! You might even recognize a few ! Monique and Alexis stories really touched my heart ! Don't miss out on this exciting story of sistah's getting together sharing some wisdom ! Who knows you might gain some yourself !
1,STAY AWAY FROM THISPRODUCT,"This product will work great for about three weeks. Then all hell breaks lose. You will need to change the channel more than often. Then, the keyboard will lose communication with the base station and for ever. Tech-support is stinky and worthless. By the time you find out about the product, you already lost your retailer return grace period, and you are left alone with some helpless pathetic tech and sales people. Stay clear from this product and save your money. This is my second system in two months from two different stores and they failed exactly the same way on time and to the minute. I had to put one star because there are no ZEROS. THIS PROUCT IS A SCAM"
3,The Coldest Winter Ever?,"The Coldest Winter Ever, this is NOT. The story line was ok. The characters were thought out, but many parts of the story were unrealistic, and others just didn't fit in with the rest of the story. I would borrow it from a friend."
5,a must have,"There are some books out there that are ok or just alright, this is not that book. This book is the bomb. The storyline was amazing. Your eyes will be glued to the pages and I guarentee you will not be disappointed. If you love URBAN fiction this one is for you!"
2,"needs constant adjusting, takes too much space on bar","I have tried using this mirror on both my road bike and my touring bike (with butterfly handlebars). In both cases, the mirror took up too much space on my handlebar and made changing hand positions awkward. I was constantly having to re-adjust the position of the mirror and tighten the velcro strap on my handlebar. I now use the mirror on a third bike that has v-shaped handle bars. It sits at the bottom of the handlebar V and is clamped on with a metal ring-shaped clamp. Since it's at the bottom of the V on the handlebar, it can't slide down any lower. It's finally functional as a rear view mirror, but not on a road bike as advertised by the vendor."
5,AutoVaughn makes me feel,"Awesome! I love these guys, whether I get to see them live or I'm just playing their CD in my car or I'm at work and plugged into my mp3 player. Their songs give me energy and more often than not get me through the day. If you're looking for something easy on the ears and a band that's just as amazing in a live show, then give these guys a listen!"
5,Classic album,"This is an amazing debut by a band that has a very bright future ahead of them. I would compare them to a little bit of Killers crossed with some U2 (guitar riffs). The song ""Hell of a Place"" is worth the price of the cd alone. If you are into the New Wave Genre with some classic U2, grab this cd. And by all means, if you can see these guys live, do yourself a favor and go.... Perhaps one of the best live performances from an Indie band I've ever seen. These guys have heart!"
5,Flight catering in the world,"Easy reading, understandable and up to date with international regulamentations and data. An excellent book for students and professionals as also for airline companies owners."
4,Gritty & heartfelt.,"As someone familiar with the domain of mental illness and the provision of services to the homeless I heartily recommend this movie. It provides an honest, unflinching look at the lives of individuals in various stages of recovery/rehabilitation, attempting to better their lives. Ms. Fleischer's documentary inspires each of us to apply a name to our fellow humans living on the streets, and to dare to connect, to care, to make a difference. Do watch this film!"
2,This has got TV movie written all over it...,"Agreeing with previous reviewers, the stars are for Brenda Gunn's courage, not for the writing style. It's a great story but Ann Rule should've written it. The trashy novel style is not meant to be used for true crime--I skipped a lot of pages (cut to the chase, so to speak) because I lost all patience with the writing style. Brenda is an intelligent woman who made a good living and smart investments but she married a guy only 2 months after meeting him and he turned out to be an ex-con...the entire marriage and relationship was a set-up involving the woman Brenda thought was her best friend: maximum betrayal. Hats off to Brenda for getting smart just in time to save her own life, but I sure wouldn't have gotten the tombstone with hearts and planned to be buried beside the guy who literally died trying to murder me...."
1,Deluded perception,"I love true crime and I have read many. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Some of the situations are so ridiculously portrayed, you know they are exaggerated, if at all true. Every character fits into overused fictionalized story stereotypes. Imagine the worst Lifetime TV Movie, and it would be worse than that. To top it off, there are several descriptions of these two people, whom no one would want to imagine naked, in intimate moments described in typical romance-novel fashion. The bonus is the ""love"" poem, written by the victim, sounding more like the prose of a third grader. Such a waste of what could have been an interesting story."
1,The heroine gets the stars....none for the writing,"The true life story of Brenda Gunn, who just wants to be happy. When Glen enters her life, it is as if all her dreams comes true. What follows is a tangled web of deceit, deception and ultimately dispair. The story could be chilling...but the writing style is so over the top that it distracts the reader. The writing is more like a trashy romance novel, which obscures the true life aspects of the story. Brenda Gunn's story deserves a better telling...I beg to disagree with a previous reviewer, this story would benifit from a detached viewpoint. I am giving it one star in honor of Brenda's bravery, without her it would get no stars."
1,Couldn't get past...,"...the first 10 minutes of this movie, I had to stop it. For those who watch it all the way through, I really hope it gets better because what I saw of it sucked!"
4,Julie & Carol at Carnegie Hall Cd,"The CD arrived earlier than promised so I was very pleased to get it well in time for Christmas. Have loved all the songs since the show was first aired in the mid- 60s. Am very happy with the service. But pity the poor neighbours, especially when I sing Meantime."
5,Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall,Had questions and the seller got back to me very quickly. Delivery was very fast.Nicely done.
2,"NOT Genuine Pearl, these are simulated pearls","The item is described as ""10 mm Pink Genuine Pearl..."" These are NOT genuine pearls. These are simulated pearls. Swarovski does make simulated pearls, these might be those simulated pearls or other simulated pearls. Quite honestly, considering the description is inaccurate, I doubt the crystal is even really Swarovski elements. It feels much more plastic-like than my genuine Swarovski items. The earrings are cute, but not the deal you might think considering the misleading title.I own three other pairs of pink pearl earrings, and bought these to replace a pair that was lost. Although these are nice, they don't quite wow me like I thought they would considering all the five star reviews."
5,Senee Patimasup,"It is really good book. Not like many other bowling book, this book is not just for a beginner. It provides many aspects of the sport (not gmae) of bowling with adequate photographs. The best thing is that it helps me increase my average! =)"
4,The Black Sox Revisited,"Hi Gene,Carney's book is a must for anyone researching this period in baseball history. He reveals a wealth of previously unpublished information about events surrounding the Black Sox Scandal. Specifically, his case regarding Comiskey's complicity in the cover-up is compelling. I am, however, skeptical about some of his claims regarding Joe Jackson. I believe Jackson did play a role in the scandal. As Carney points out, Shoeless Joe's testimony during the 1924 trial differed sharply with what he said four years earlier. But why should his 1924 statements carry more weight than those made in 1920? Despite Jackson's alleged involvement, I think he should be reinstated and voted in to the Hall of Fame. As Carney said, ""It aint's/for saints."""
5,A Must Read For Shoeless Joe Jackson Fans,"Put Shoeless Joe Jackson in the HOF where he belongs. The man was honest as could possibly be, played better than anyone on both teams, CWS owner was as crooked as the devil, who BTW is IN the HOF, one of life's true tragedies that needs clearing up immediately by a presently scared and bullied Commissioner. Shameful. The book is a 100% prover of Jackson's innocent. A SUPER-MUST-READ for any Shoeless Joe Jackson fan. I have already shipped it to a friend in Boston, MA.Lengthy, but crammed facts, great ammo for the Jackson defender."
3,My Dad had me order this so he could give it to his girlfriend.,"I was confused at first when he was asking me where he could find a TY Beanie Baby dog. I was like...Amazon? So I ordered it for him, he said it looked good. I didn't even tell me who it was for. This was in the beginning of their relationship so I didn't know her yet. So yeah she came over one day and I saw it on her cars dashboard. So I'm guessing it holds up well under extreme heat. I don't know it's weird. My dads girlfriend is younger than I am. Go him I guess! Still weird though."
2,Too small,"I thought it would be bigger, like 12"" or so was I disappointed. I waited and when package arrived it was a small med sized envelope. I just looked at it and said no way. This can't be it. There is no way they could fit it into this envelope. Low and behold there it was cute but very small. There was no size listed that gave me an indication what the size was. I bought this from paradise through amazon. I will be more careful in the future. Wasted $20 includign shipping."
4,Great for small apartments or rooms,"I live in a one bedroom apartment, and for some reason my bedroom is always the coldest room in the apartment. This is a great little heater, it makes a steady humming noise because of the fan inside it but its easy for me to sleep right through it. I had to experiment with the settings to find the right one for my room and once I did, its perfect. The nice thing about it is that if it tips over it automatically shuts off, and once it reaches the set temperature it shuts off as well. Its a good little heater, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I just got it, and I don't know how long it will last but it seems to being doing well."
1,cord is WAY TO STIFF,"I've bought Holmes heaters for years. This one must be the result of some 'bean counter' edict to cut costs. The cord must have steel wire or super stiff cheap plastic insulation. It is so stiff, you can't lay it down on any surface. I returned these to Amazon and bought similar from Lowes."
1,Good Heaters While They Worked,"Bought two heaters based on customer reviews. After 5-6 months of use, both heaters have malfunctioned and do not turn on."
4,nice little heater,"This is a nice little heater it gives off good heat, my only problem is that it is a tad noisy because the fan blowing if it's place too close to you ,other than that it's great!!."
3,Great when it works,On my second one- first one just stopped working after about 8 months. Not a big deal since they are so cheap!
3,noisy,"This heater is not a bad heater if you don't mind the noise. We bought it for our baby's room and took it back next day. When the heater goes on it is just too noisy so our baby would wake up. It is cheap, it works but it is awful noisy."
2,SO LOUD!,"I bought this heater for my office, and I could not keep it on because of the noise level. It truely is forced heat! Also, at times, it would blow cold air like the heat aspect would short out."
4,Just what I needed,"The Price, the quality, its all just right. If you're looking to buy a pair of speakers to help add a little more bass to your sound, as well as a little more volume, then these are perfect. You do however need an amplifier to make this product work."
3,Pyle-Pro PADH1079 Speaker,"Early in August 2011 we purchased a pair to improve the sound from our parade float which already has 4 speakers. These replaced two of the smaller speakers on the float. The result is a very satisfying level of audio. The amount of bass is a satisfactory augmentation to the 15"" speakers on-board. However, the level of materials and workmanship is decidedly inferior. One of the cabinets arrived with the 10"" driver torn from its mounting due to the inferior pressed board used in the construction. We made repairs prior to first use, but these cabinets will not stand up to very much rough use. With proper care we will continue to use these speakers for a very satisfactory sound on our float."
5,"Goodbye Dandruff, Hello Pantene","I have been using Pantene Anti-Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner for four months now, and the only time I have flakes or other symptoms of dandruff is if I stop using it for a few days.Pantene is the only company I know that gets the shampoo + conditioner concept right, and this shampoo is so gentle that I only condition my hair once a week. It doesn't smell like dandruff shampoo, nor have I noticed any damage to my hair by using it. On the contrary, my hair is quite shiny now (as well as flake free)!The only downside of this product is the fact that the 2-in-1 conditioner part builds up in your hair after frequent use, so make sure you pair this with a good clarifying shampoo (I suggest Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo)."
4,"Useful for purpose, sturdy materials, decent sound.","5 stars would have required a bit better sound; this isn't as full a sound as I'd like (I do not like heavy bass, I just mean tonally). Good quality materials generally, though ear-piece covers fell off and were lost quickly and I needed to replace them, easy enough with dollar-store replacements (these have stayed on better than the originals).It wasn't that easy for me to find behind the head phones, these are good quality for the purpose."
3,it sure would be great if they would put the price back to what it was this morning!,"The price for 125ft was $[...] and shipped for free! Here this morning!$[...] what the hell is this crap?Thanks for nothing.Other info about the product;flux tube is plastic.. not sure it does anything good but when you spread the bundles and cut the ""flux tube"" it makes the wire easily fit in terminals!Despite the glossy finish, it is extremely flexible!"
3,mediocre debut album,"Her 2 steps songs ""love shy"" and ""you make me go oooh oooh"" are really nice. ""Teach him"" was written by Andrea Martin. But then Kristine turned a bit into a wanna-be Britney which really makes it less interesting"
5,Star System -- Schmar Syster,"Like the one star fakers, liars and dopes, I have not read this Book ! But I liked the author interview and so am buying it.Until amazon puts some kind of Proof of Purchase requirement on the ability to review a book, I'll give all the books I am buying five stars so as to average out at least one of the liars.Review to follow."
4,She will be paid no more,"Before I read Barbara Olson's very interesting account of the former first lady and current junior Senator from New York, I always thought that Hillary Clinton was a Marxist. Now, I realize that this assessment is not really being fair to Karl Marx. It would be more accurate on further review to describe Ms. Clinton as a Stalinist. Anyhow, the book is fascinating and should be read by all, particularly in light of the fact that Senator Clinton may one day become the first female President of the United States."
5,I LOVE NEW YORK!,"This book really nails it,but I'm afraid it won't matter because today's society and the state of New York is full of Rosie O'Donnells, but as long as we have factual books like these it helps to think that maybe there is hope."
1,Poor source of information,"I was disappointed in Olson's research. Much of the information included was later found to be false. I could go on to say the book is biased, but that is made obvious merely by examining Olson's own political believes. My review is biased too, and I am likely revealing my own beliefs, but I am not a journalist or a professional writer by any means. I rely on journalists to give me valid and confirmed information. Spreading rumors as facts not only puts her in the same camp with the tabloids, but increasingly the same camp as many in the popular media. Of course, she's had months to confirm her facts and hasn't."
1,Propaganda- or worse!,"It is really sad that the late Barbara Olson will be remembered not just as an innocent victim of September 11th's terrorist attack, but for her extreme hatred of Hillary Clinton, that spilled over into a dreck of a book, ""Hell to Pay"". I am sure she was a very nice person while she walked this world, but judging by ""Hell to Pay"", she seemed a very spite-filled person, convinced that Hillary and Bill were Marxist insurgents bent on turning the USA into Soviet Amerika, and only by stalwart compassionate conservatism could the Marxist threat be eradicated(with ample firepower and bloodshed). It is one thing to dislike someone based on their politics, but to smear them with outdated rhetoric and accuse them of treason is quite another."
4,These are Gene Clark solo recordings,"These songs are not by the Byrds (although both Gene Clark and John York are former Byrds). In the mid 80s Gene Clark, Pat Robinson and John York recorded together under the name Cry. I have never seen these tracks issued under the real name and that's a shame,I think. The music is great though and I recommend the cd to all Gene Clark fans."
3,Not as comfortable as their Pro Comfort tampons,"Compared to OB Pro Comfort tampons, these are slightly larger, and they don't have the cover on them that makes insertion easier. Personally I find insertion of these to be kind of uncomfortable.I would like OB to start making their cardboard applicator tampons again, I would definitely use them."
5,"Perfect, Magnificent",I really appreciate the contents and included many British examples and ths book contains all the terms I need. I really have nothing to criticize about this book.
3,Not Bad for a Kid,"As a teacher of English, I'm familiar with the way college age students write. Al DiOrio created this tribute to Judy when he was exactly that age. It's warm-hearted, uncritical and -- from what I've read in any number of works on Judy since her death -- a little book that she definitely would have loved. It would be interesting to know what the author is doing now, almost 30 years after this title was published."
1,Couldn't get past one sentance...,"""Hackers are generally lazy but intelligent, which means they don't like doing something boring that they can program the computer to do for them instead."" and thats as far as I got. It irritates me how someone thinks they have enough knowledge on a subject to write a book, yet blatantly has no understanding of the subculture they pretend to have an expertise in. You can get away with this trashy writing in The Daily Mail, but if you're trying to educate people then you're just going to get seen thru straight away."
3,It was a good video but too long!,The video spends WAY to much time telling you how to breath and to lie lifeless on your mat. (about 10 minutes!) IN general the poses are very good if you are looking for a video to relieve stress and get a small amount of exercise this would be great. If you were looking for a real exercise video this is not for you. It's very slow paced and some of the poses could use a little more instruction.
5,heel grips,As advertised these heel grips arrived on time - they keep me from walking out of my shoes!
3,Decent,"I can't review this book from the perspective of a beginner, but as someone who's done some reading on Japanese culture, I can say this book doesn't have much to offer. A relatively small amount of general knowledge about Japanese culture and society is all that it takes to be able to easily answer most of the questions in this book. This problem is exacerbated by the tendency for two out of the four choices to be obviously improbable, or even ridiculous, making choosing more an issue of ""multiple choice test sense"" than knowledge of the Japanese. Yes, I did learn from this book; even the explanations for questions that I already knew the answers to were sometimes informative. However, it is a *very* quick read. I think that books which talk more generally about Japanese/American societal differences, while offering specific and interesting examples along the way, are more informative and worth their price."
4,Professional loooks,"I would like to highly Recommend this product, its looks very professional with good Quality. you can see your money replacement."
2,only used it twice,this tamp is curved on the bottom.. I don't like it. Used it twice and have gone back to my cheapy plastic tamp that came with my machine.
4,"It was good, But it could have been better","This is the first book for a series called Young Jedi Knights. Unfortunately, the characters are very advanced when you meet them so you kind have to 'grab on' to get the point. Although i liked this book, I think that Kevin and Rebecca could make it a lot better with just a little imagination."
3,Interesting,"I thought this book was very interesting, and weird [ like when the two headed, flying creatures were chasing Tenel Ka ]. I'm not saying this book was bad, I'm just saying that it could have been better. Though I really enjoyed most of the book, I still think they could have made it better. In my opinion do not purchase this book if you like tons of action and adventure. Over and out."
3,"Light, quick read","Leia and Han's twins are studying at Luke's Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. They make new friends - and discover old enemies.This was a light, quick read. The characters are surprisingly well-drawn and the plot is straightforward enough that it doesn't hinder that, nor is it bogged down by how many main characters there are. Everything is a bit too pat at the end, but honestly, one only expects so much from tie-in novels. The story is fun, the movie characters are recognizable, everything seems to fit the universe. I won't read it again, but it was a pleasant way to spend an evening."
4,Custom Semi Trucks,"From a woman who has been taking photographs of trucks for over twenty years has finally came out with a book of her excellent work of photograph, of trucks. You have seen in work for American Trucker magazine up to current Roadstar magazine. I have to say its about time that she has had a photographs published in her own book. She covers 28 show trucks,over a span about 5 yrs. All in All get this book, if you love the show trucks that are at the truck show, you will love this book. I was pleased to have this sittin under the Christmas tree."
1,As terrible as it gets,"I unfortunately must echo the sentiments of other reviewers of this book: it's a tangled mess that leads nowhere. If you're already an expert at CORBA programming, there's an off-chance that you might find something useful in this book. If you're a novice, forget it."
2,The terrible organization kills it,"The book jumps right in to advanced topics, such as ORB interoperability. Then, it backs up to basic C++/CORBA concepts. Then advanced Java. Then basic C++. In fact, the author describes the organization as consisting of a number of sections which may be read in any order, but these sections are not clearly delimited or even internally organized. In fact, Chapters 4 and 6 constitute one section! That's right, you're expected to jump in to chapter four, and, on finishing it, skip immediately to chapter 6. Number 5 is virtually unrelated. Come on folks! That's ridiculous!"
4,This book provides you with a solid technical guidelines,It is a great book that gives you a good understanding of Object Oriented programming. Basic Object Oriented Programming topics are covered to give you a thorough understanding of the core technology before moving on to ORB (Object Request Brokers) and CORBA.
4,Fun in the sun beach read.,I'm a big fan of Cara Lockwood's writing so I knew I had to read this book. It's a spin-off of her book titled 'I Do (But I Dont)'. This book is based on the character Lily who's in the process of getting a divorce from her rock star husband Ted Dayton. It's funny and fast paced. Ian has to be my favorite character.
2,"A Couple Good Songs, But It's Not Because of the Drums","Following the typical Beatles album, there are a couple of good songs on this CD with a lot of filler. Photograph and It Don't Come Easy are O.K., but the rest of the album is pretty forgettable.And although he had a lot of personality, there is a long, long, long line of better drummers, starting with John Bonham, Mick Fleetwood, Don Henley, Max Weinberg, Ginger Baker, Stewart Copeland ...."
5,He's the greatest,"This was Ringo's first rock album, after forays intostandardsandcountry. To many people's surprise, he managed to release a great album. Of course, he did have a lot of help, including all the other ex-Beatles. This is what a Beatles album might have sounded like, if Ringo sang lead on all the songs. There were three big hits from this album, ""Photograph"", ""You're Sixteen"" and ""Oh My My"". Of course, those songs are great, but so are the rest of the songs on the album. The CD release includes three great non-LP bonus tracks. ""It Don't Come Easy"" was another smash hit, and the other two songs are fun B-sides. If you are going to buy only one Ringo album, this is the one to get, even more so thanBlast from Your Past. Hell, six of the ten songs from that CD are on this CD anyway."
4,Drumming?,"The last reviewer made a disparaging remark about Ringo's drumming ability. It's amazing to me how people who know nothing about drumming comment on Ringo's ability, or lack of.Take it from me...this guy could, and still can play! He does subtle things that only drummers can appreciate. Nothing flashy, but I'll be damned if many other drummers can play some of the stacatto fills that he can.""Ringo"" is an excellent record."
3,Not a bad drill for the money,I've recently purchaced the drill with expectations of a 500$ item and that's what i recieved. I do use this product alot and it is a very nice drill for the home or garage only drawback i encountered was the table .In my eyes it is build very cheaply but i'm used to being around 5000$ clausings . But for all the wood and metal i drilled so far i haven't stalled it lol. All this tool needs is a little tlc and some home made hardware. I think on all these types of tools they scimp on the hardware.Overall it really does the job.
4,Good,To bad that this movie hasn't bin brought out on DVD? This is a great movie. The quality is ok. Thanks.
4,Nice,"This shampoo smells great. I don't think it includes conditioner, so it might make your hair feel less smooth if you wash your hair a lot."
5,Excellent stereo,I've been using this model stereo literally for years on both my motorcycle helmet and when cutting the yard...Unfortunatly replacement ears pads are not available when these wear out however I found a multi set that fit the ear speakers elsewhere on-line...
5,My perfect Sony,I wanted this Sony so I could put on the earphones and go outside to do my lawn and flower work. I love it! It is light enough to put in a pocket or clip onto a shirt or jacket. I can even mow the lawn and listen to my favorite programs. Thanks Amazon!
4,Excellent value and Performance,"I bought this radio out of curiousity, after reading about its outstanding long-range AM reception (my wife and I spend a lot of time up in the mountains). However I made the mistake of listening to it at work - the FM sounds so good, I sent back the Sennheiser noise-cancelling phones my company provides, and use the SRF-59 instead, to drown out all the sounds of co-workers yelling into their phones, coughing, sneezing, singing at their desks, etc. So... I will probably buy another SRF-59 for use in the outdoors. Physically, the radio looks and feels solid - I guess time will tell. Shortcomings? More difficult to tune than a digital rig, but that's a given on a small analog radio. Also the belt-clip thingy is awkward to use. Other than that it is hard to fault, especially at under $15.Later: I forgot to mention, my radio came with the Sony MDR Headphones - these phones sound good, are lightweight, have enough bass but not too much."
4,Sony digital Walkman,"Couldn't believe the light weight of this walkman when I received it. I thought that the 'guts' were left out of it and I just got the shell. But no.... Put in the battery per the instruction and got the talk station I listen to daily loud and clear. It does not lose it signal when I turn different directions or go downstairs into my basement. The on/off button is rather small on the from of the walkman but it has a nice click when you turn it either way. I would have rated it five stars if it wasn't for the headset. It is hard to adjust properly to your ears and therefore you have a tendency to pick up outside noises. If you have a headset that you like to wear and it will fit the walkman jack, I recommend you change to that one and keep the Sony headset as a backup."
1,Waste of Time and Money!!!,"This thing is a piece of junk. The sound was never ever clear when I switched to AM. FM was better while it lasted. The reason I bought this radio was so that I could listen to talk radio on AM. Right now the unit will turn on and I can tune into the station, but it gradually develops a buzzy noise and finally shuts down. And to think this is made by SONY!! I bought the item less than a month back, I wish Amazon could just give me a refund so I could buy a better player."
2,Works only Sometimes,"Great little radio when it works. Problem is, the jack for the headphones does not make a solid connection with the port it plugs into. I have to constantly either rotate the jack or put pressure on it to regain the signal. Otherwise I get static or weak signal.Not sure whether to return it and hope for a better replacement or just chalk it up to another disappointing purchase. I would advise anyone thinking about buying this radio to check out others first even if they cost a bit more."
2,Sony SRF-59 /AM Radio with MDR Headphones,The sound quality of the headphone is poor and they barely sit on your head.The tone of the AM/FM radio is less than desired.It would be better if the tunning were at least digital and incorporated into the headphone.
2,Stereo or not?,"I just listened to ""Frankenstein"" by Edgar Winter on this radio. It is stereo. Maybe not the greatest stereo separation, maybe it's my brain, but my belief that it is FM mono was incorrect.I will add that I bought this for my wife to listen to when she is walking, and she won't use it as she says the stations fade in and out. We are 25 miles from L.A. so the reception is pretty good.Original review:The item description is incorrect. It says AM/FM Stereo Radio. When you look at the radio itself, it says ""FM/AM"". It only has FM mono and AM. The description should be corrected. The sound is OK for mono, but that's a lot different from stereo. I haven't listened to the AM."
2,Disappointed,The radio is bigger than i thought it would be and the reception is not very good. I thught since it had a distance switch it would pick up stations better and that is not the case. Would not reccommend anyone but this radio.
4,Sony Walkman srf 59 am/fm --GOOD RADIO,For this price of course it isn't a magnificent radio as one reviewer called it- but it isgood enough for daily use (in my case I listen to Dennis Prager for a few hours every week day).My previous review of this radio was a rant about how it stopped working properly after justfour months There is a lot of static that overwhelms the sound IF YOU DON'T PUT A FRESH BATTERYIN IT ONCE THIS STATIC OCCURS. You can continue to listen with the old battery but the staticwon't go away.
5,Exatly What I Wanted,it's getting harder and harder to find little AM/FM radios in the stores. This is small but has great sound and in stereo.
1,Can't get AM reception in tall downtown building,"I bought this small AM/FM radio to listen to the local baseball game when at work and on the bus. But when I recieved the product the AM stations would not come in when I was downtown on the 5th floor of a skyscraper.I have no idea why this radio will get signal at my house 15 miles from downtown, but once I am downtown it has nothing coming in. I am thinking about returning this and getting something more powerful.After a few more days: This radio has almost no power, it constantly fades in and out and doesn't hold a strong signal on fm and am is barely their at all if you are lucky. It also picks up a lot of other interference from Bus engines and computers that it is located by.Please listen and do not buy this product, you will be just as sad as me :("
3,Simply functional,"I found this item while searching for a small portable AM radio. It'll do the trick, however, it could have been made a fraction of its size - it's bigger than my last AM radio. No bells or whistles just good reception and simple controls. Single battery operation runs this unit for weeks!"
4,Replacement,The Kids loved them both. Begain using the day they arrived. Replacements as the a thief has the old one's!
3,Sony Walkman good for the price,"This Sony walkman has no frills, just a radio. The headphones are comfortable and the sound is good, sometime you lose range when walking - the only drawback, but most of the time it works fine and the price was right."
1,Save your money!!,"I purchased this ""walkman"" a few days ago I was so excited about having a device to hear the local news and the religious programs on the AM stations. Not one AM station came through. I'm not sure if it's the building I work in or the device, but either way it didn't work!!! I'm very disappointmented by it. I will be returning it a.s.a.p.!!"
1,Not Very Soulful,"I can only assume that this version of Soulful sounds refers to soul as being praise for God and your soul, not soul in the music. Most songs on this tape didn't have a soul rhythm to them and were more like bland gospel. Some songs did try to add soul, but the effort seemed forced and over the top. Volume 3 is much better at being soulful in the rhythm department."
5,These guys will be HUGE!,"Seattle's best kept secret! I agree, that kickin' bass by Cory Sandahl is great."
5,Love,My kids loved these skates so much they refused to take them off. They are holding up well to outdoor skating and my 5 year old is able to take them on and off by himself.
2,Never liked compilations,"There are a few good articles, but this book is for hard corps political & military history academics. It was required reading for a required military academic course. Only read it if it's required, then try to get the bare minimum done."
5,Sony A100,The item was received in excellent condition and as described in the ad. Prompt service was noted on Cameta Camera's end. I would buy from them again and will recomment them to my friends and family. Thanks again Cameta Camera.
4,A quick sci-fi/horror fix,"This is a book that I liked. But did not love. The entire beginning is a set up for the many characters in the story and because of that; I believe a lot of ""time"" was lost in regards to the meat of the question, the heart of the story. Even the alien took a while to set up. But that would be fine is the book was longer. The interesting parts feel rushed, specially the finale, which was the best part of the book, but contrarily to other books where the action takes place over the course of many weeks, months, even years, and this one was speedy. It took little time to resolve. And frankly it is understandable; the people are plain ordinary, like you and me. How much of their normal lives do we really want to know about than what is necessary to keep the plot going and our attention of course?It's a quick read. You'll like it. I already recommended it to most of my friends.I got a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of this review. Cheers!"
2,Ho-Hum,"I picked this book up on a free Kindle offer and I'm glad for the price. I made it 27% through before calling it quits. The author does do well with descriptions of locations and characters, but to me, they came across as animated stereotypes--nothing too unique or interesting to any of them. And, there were so many of them. I like King and Koontz, but didn't find that quality of work here. I kept it to two stars--""I didn't like it"", however, because there are tons of junk books available on the Kindle for free, and this is definitely a cut above those, both in the author's skill and execution."
2,Average and Uninspired,"Nicholson's 2nd novel feels very uninspired. Scenes move slowly forward with predictability and very little atmosphere. Scares? There really isn't any. Just a bunch of overly descriptive scenes of gore. The repetitive actions of the creatures got old very quickly. I didn't really care about the cardboard characters and knew the ending a hundred pages before it was over. I'll hesitantly pick up Scott's new book, The Manor, where hopefully he will impress me as he did with his first book, The Red Church."
1,Yuk!,These are like pieces of cardboard dipped in a very acidic vinegar - barely any salt flavor - very unsatisfying and leave a terrible acidic taste
2,just not very amusing,"I expected more background on hi stroke and recovery process to compare it to mine. Also, just not very amusing."
3,Not Soft but Very Strong,"I try to make environmentally friendly choices, and knowing how many boxes of tissues my family blows through, I thought I'd switch to a greener brand. I read many reviews before I settled on this brand and had faith when people claimed that these tissues were soft. Bad choice. These tissues are about as soft as those industrial paper towels that plague restrooms in government buildings. As soon as I pulled the first tissue from the first box I knew that I would never order these again (and cursed the fact that I had ordered a case of 24 boxes of a brand I'd never tried before). If you are accustomed to the softness of Kleenex or Puffs, then don't pick these tissues. On the plus side, they are very strong and don't leave a lot of tissue lint around. I just can't get past the scratchy factor, though, and will switch back to Kleenex when/if we ever run out of these tissues."
3,Nice watch but watchband too long,"This is a good-looking watch with non-traditional diver colors for a distinct appearance. Medium-heavy weight that still feels good. The hands are not as luminescent as I would have liked. The band is nice looking and smooth feeling, but, despite removing all removable links and setting the clasp pin to the tightest setting, was still too loose (for me) on my 7"" wrist. I like a band that allows the watch to stay in one place on my wrist without pinching. This one would still slide around, even at the tightest setting. Had to buy a leather band that doesn't match the good looks of the original."
4,Product Good Vendor Terrible,Ordered base and additional unit. Only received additional unit. Will dispute charge with credit card company. Vendor that sold me product would not send me base. I tried calling and leaving messages as well as email but to no avail still without base. I like the product I already had one just expanding and needed another base. Vendor is not reliable. This is also second time I have had diffuclty purchasing something via amazon.com. Will probably not order again using amazon.
2,Not Good Enough to Keep,"1. If two people pick up handsets to answer at the same time ONLY ONE will actually be connected to the incoming call. The other will get an error tone and not hear the conversation. The person using the line must first put the outside party on hold, ring the expansion handset, then remove the hold.2. This phone does NOT have a Message Indicator Light3. The buttons are too difficult to push accurately.4. The phone makes an annoying noise when you place it back on the base."
2,"Too much negative, not enough help.","I agree with Kathleen's description of this book.IF you (the woman) entered marriage without any sexual scars of your own, and IF you're pretty clueless as to how the male mind works regarding sexual stimulation, then this book might be helpful. But, as one who's hurting both from my husband's problem (which I'm all too familiar with) and my own past, wading through all the horror stories of what various men have done just set my mind off on negative tracks.I slogged through the first two or three chapters, thought, ""this is not helpful;"" so I skipped ahead thinking I'd get to the ""now this is what you do about it"" part, but it was more of the same.I would not recommend this book to most women.BTW, the ""Every Man's Battle"" book has been very helpful for my husband. Another book I think he'd recommend is ""False Intimacy"" by Schaumburg."
4,Speaker phone with mute button,"It's a very good phone over all. But the main reason I got it was for the speaker phone and mute button since I am disabled an cannot regularly attend the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses and get these by phone. For this purpose, the speaker phone does not go quite loud enough to be comfortable. It will work but all must be really silent in the room to hear (no heater, etc.) So depending on an individuals needs, it's either an OK phone or a very good phone."
2,Poor speakerphone & microphone functionality,"I bought this phone for one feature - the speakerphone, and that feature is very disappointing. Often, when I try to use the speakerphone, the other party tells me he or she cannot hear me. AT&T put a very weak microphone into this unit. Also, the speaker volume does not go up that high. Did they not perform any quality control testing? I ask because it's such an obvious weakness. I like the nice big buttons and the long receiver chord. However, AT&T threw the baby out with the bathwater by giving this unit poor speakerphone & microphone functionality."
5,outstanding,This phone is everything that I excepted. It has great clarity and phone quality. I really like this phone and would recommend this phone to everyone.
4,As advertised,"I'm not sure why this item has received bad reviews, to me, it was all that was advertised and a real bargain at the price.The set-up is fairly simple; directions are good too.If you need a corded phone that requires no AC plugin, then by all means, this phone exceeds (my) expectations.For the folks that gave this product a bad review? all I can think is they got a lemon (or they are the lemon).To me, it was a good deal, and the speaker phone feature works well too."
3,Umm ok,"I kinda hope Connor and Tia hook up, they'd make a better couple..I don't really like Liz all that much..and I wish there was more of Jessica in the book. There's quite a twist in the Andy storyline, kinda surprising..overall the book was ok but not the best"
1,A waste,"Yet another tree died in vain to produce the paper for this book. How the author was able to type whilst simultaneously patting his own back is a wonder to behold. If name-dropping from 20,000 feet is your styrofoam cup of tea, this self-congratulatory paean is for you.As Mrs. Parker said of a similar book...""this is not a book to be lightly tossed aside. It should be thrown with great force."""
2,Slightly disappointed,"For the class work my daughter's school is currently doing, this book is more like 3rd grade. It needs more examples to teach kids. Compared to the kind of class work my daughter's school is currently doing this book did not work for us. I'll save it for son who is younger."
3,Interesting idea but...,"I bought these because although I love to knit it does get cumbersome to lug books or magazines around. I was looking for a balance of types of items and these were mostly clothing for adults. I kept about a third of the cards and gave the rest away to friends. Many of the clothing items were for advanced knitters and I like to knit fairly simple. Also, the cards are not as convenient as I hoped. They fold in the middle making it hard to reference things on another part of the card. Making a copy of a pattern (like my knitting guru said) and using that during the knitting makes more sense. You can make notations, keep track of stitches, etc. on your copy. You could make copies of the cards but, honestly, there isn't anything here you haven't seen in a book or magazine."
5,Love the deck!,"The thing I love about this collection is that not only are the patterns all so doable, but also that they are done in the style of a deck of cards! I love love love it. I don't know why more writers aren't doing their patterns this way. I can organize them in any order that I want and I can throw the pattern(and not a whole book) into my bag with my needles and yarn! There is a great variety of patterns with great pictures and they are sturdy and feel great in your hands. LOVE THEM!"
5,EXCELLENT!,"I initially ordered two of these as gifts for women younger and less experienced in the kitchen than myself. Upon looking through the book, I was so impressed that I immediately placed an order for a third - for myself. I've been cooking for forty years, but there is truly something in this book for everyone!"
5,great product my husband works on a aircraft carrier all day and these really come in handy.,great product my husband works on a aircraft carrier all day and these really come in handy.
4,The Best of Andersen's Albums,"I'm not a huge Eric Andersen fan (I was only nine when the album came out and so have none of the period-nostalgia I see in the other reviews.) And I think that there are a fair number of Eric Andersen songs that are pretty mediocre--lyrics and melodies that aren't very memorable. That said, at his best, Andersen is terrific. And this album has more great songs than any of his others. ""Blue River,"" and ""Wind and Sand"" are my favorites--wistful and poignant. ""Perl's Goodtime Blues"" is also a good one. The only great Andersen song that's not on this album is ""Time Run Like A Freight Train."""
1,"spend a few more bucks and get the leatherman micra, its worth it","I recently had my Leatherman Micra confiscated at the airport (forgot to put it in my checked luggage and they don't allow such things as carry-on items anymore!), so I headed to target to purchase a replacement Micra as I use it frequently at work.I saw the Gerber shortcut at almost half the price and had heard Gerber made a good multitool, so I gave it a shot.Bad idea! The scissors especially is much weaker and has a lot of trouble cutting through things the micra just tore through. Especially plastic loading straps. The gerber scissors 'bounce' off the loading straps more often than not, and often get dislocated trying to make a cut. Whereas the Leatherman micra could often cut two at a time.This one LOOKS cooler, but does not handle the same workload. Decide what is more important to you."
5,A book for everyone to read.,Every student in High School and college should read this book to realize how lucky she/he is to live in America.
2,Only for suckers or hardcore fans,"As has been pointed out in previous reviews, these are not the original recordings! They re-recordings passed off as the hits. The only people who might be interested in this are the hardcore Grass Roots fans who want everything they recorded. If you want the real hits, buy ""All Time Greatest Hits"" instead of this cheap re-recording."
4,Generic Air Bear Furnace Air Filter,"The 3 pack of filters arrived promptly and were well packed. I didn't score it higher because they were slightly larger than the filter I took out. The dimensions match on paper, but the new filters are extremely tight. I had to do a lot of bending the make it fit."
3,makes tiny pieces.,"The pieces are very fine and tiny. I tried it with ginger, and it's ok, but I guess my ginger was too old because part of the ginger became mushy. I'll have to try it again with fresher ginger.I tried it with daikon, and the pieces were too fine for my taste, so I had to use my traditional grater.I think if you were more interested in appearance than eating, it's ok."
1,Fuzzy logic and neurofuzzy applications in business and fina,"This book has a promising blurb which lead to me buy it. I was greatly disappointed. The blurbs suggested that the book would have plenty of detailed examples for the use of fuzzy logic in business and finance. The examples were there, but few and far in between, without the detail that would have made them useful case studies. Instead the author spends almost the entire book on one *single* fuzzy logic software called fuzzytech. The book is more like a manual for fuzzytech applications than it is an exposition on the use of fuzzy logic for business and finance."
4,Excellent Quality,"This is an excellent everyday utility knife.The steel used in this blade is above-average quality, sharpening nicely and holding an edge reasonably well. At this price, though, one could expect a slightly higher quality steel, perhaps AUS-10 or 440C. This is my only gripe with this knife. The steel is very good, but it could be better in this price range.The metal work is nothing short of excellent. The locking mechanism is superbly solid, hands-down the strongest I've seen in any locking folding knife in this price range. No problems with opening and closing, even after some rather tough jobs.The Zytel handle is great, as well, combining light weight with excellent strength. It is light enough and compact enough to be virtually unnoticeable while clipped to the inside of one's pants pocket. Yet, this light little handle can stand up to some rather tough abuse.All in all, if there was one knife I would have to carry around every day, this would be the one."
5,Best book for understanding Lacan,"I purchased this to supplement my understanding of Lacan for a doctoral seminar on &#381;i&#382;ek. It is extremely readable with theory and case examples, and notes points of divergence between Freud and Lacan. A must read for anyone interested in psychoanalytic theory."
2,Too many stories to follow,"The main reason I didn't like this movie was because there were too many stories to follow. There were too many stories and conflicts going on at the same time that it started to give me a headache trying to keep track with it. About two-thirds of the way through, the movie started getting good, plus the car chase scence in this movie was good as well. It was just way too late in the movie for me to start liking it."
2,Worst movie of the summer,"I came into the movie theater thinking that it was going to be a great movie, Harrison Ford and Josh H, but I was sadly disapointed. I comibination did nothing to complament one another. The movie focused too much on Ford's realastate business while Josh was played out as a sex god, not letting him give his best in the film. In the end, I think that this film could have been MUCH better than was it really was."
1,AWFUL,This movie was horrible. It wasnt even OK. Everything was bad. The acting. The casting. The roles. The plot. I almost walked out of the theater.
1,SUCKS!!!,"This movie is horrible! Joe Gavilan is a real-estate agent who hasn't made a deal in years, and a cop. The jokes about real-estate get really old really fast and Josh Harrnet's role is crappy. It seems as though, when they make a joke, they don't give it a push, it just falls flat out of their mouths. I respect Harrison Ford, but even the little jokes in star Wars come out better than this. The movie is full of fluff and the first hour is nothing. The only time if found myself intertained was when ""Domineique"" is naked in the hot tub and they start makin' out. So, don't rent this movie, or buy it and make the same mistake I did, watch Psycho instead. That! is a good movie."
4,Ford is at his best,"surely enough I enjoyed this buddy cop movie. Ford and his partner/wannabe actor/yoga teacher Hartnett investigate a murder at a local club. blending comedy and action in is great. Harrison Ford has never been cooler and funnier and Hartnett is great too. favorite scene is when Hartnett and Ford are in seperate rooms and they are interrigated and Hartnett is doing yoga and attracting the lady officer while in the other room Ford is going wacky. for fans of Ford or the handsome Hartnett and yes I think hes handsome, he has a face smoother than a babys bottom"
2,Another Disappointment,"After the anticipation to see this movie I found it a great disappointment. Harrison Ford is a good actor but due to poor direction he appeared to be a bit of a klutz. A few more takes on some of the scenes might have proven to improve them. Especially when the actors seemed to be acting so hard. It was difficult to follow the story line. The movie was more about the two detectives. The laughs would have come much more naturally if they had followed one story line and have the laughs come from that. The movie also went on much too long and the final action scene could have been cut at least 5 minutes and we wouldn't have missed it. Hopefully, Harrison's and Josh's next project will be better."
1,terrible movie,"I LOVE Harrison Ford and have over 15 of his movies on DVD. I wouldn't own this DVD for anything, this is a terrible movie and the leads have no chemistry together, constant awkwardness, Josh is silly...I would not see this movie again. All of Harrison's other movies I watch over and over and fall in love with again and again. This movie was a waste of his time and creative energy. I really wouldn't even give it 1 star."
5,i love this movie,I love HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE. IT IS THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR. HARRISON FORD IS REALLY FUNNY. THE END IS SUPER ACTION PACK. WITH FORD KICKING BUTT. I CAN'T WAIT TO OWN IT ON DVD. IT NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. FORD AND JOSH HARTNETT ARE BOTH SUPER FUNNY IN THIS ACTION PACK- COMEDY.
2,"Poor Story, Weak Direction... but a Good Chase Scene","Okay.. I nearly fell asleep a few times during the first hour of the film. Harrison Ford walked through his part in this film and he deserves better, and Harnett, though potentially talented, is simply NOT convincing as the sensitive, metaphysical yoga instructor-cop. Never mind, it was fun to see Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson and Frank Sinatra Jr. in bit parts... the familiar landmarks around Hollywood, and the chase scene at the end of the film is really good... but it's not enough to save this film for me. OH, by the way, this is supposed to be a comedy.. it is NOT. It has some humorous IRONY in it, but NEVER comedy. Martin Landau is great in his part... but its all too brief.... too bad."
4,"This is an ""in-tank"" pump","The pump looked fine, but what I needed was the external high-pressure pump. (Still trying to figure out which one that is on Amazon for an '88 F250 w/ EFI 460) The reference in the description which said ""inlet and outlet positions match original"" led me to believe this was the external pump. I ordered the in-tank replacement at the same time, but it included the hanger and sender unit, so it looked completely different. This included just the parts to replace the internal pump. The return through Amazon was as easy as it could be!"
5,A Boot Built To Last,"The construction of these boots is what makes them so great. Fully waterproof, solid leather that will hold up to the sharpest rocks, a pulley system on all of the shoelace eyelets for easy tightening a loosening, and rubber that will grip everything but ice.I will never buy a different backpacking/hiking boot. These boots are a pleasure to walk in and I used to walk in them for 5-10 miles every day. Walking many miles with a heavy pack is nothing for these boots and your feet will thank you for it. There was a point where I never wanted to take off my boots because they were so comfortable.I have owned them 2 years now and they still don't leak, the rubber is as good as ever, and the soles are still solid. I won't buy another brand of boot.I HIGHLY recommend these boots and would give them 6 stars if I could."
1,Music For Las Vegas Magicians On An NBC Special,"This album marks a huge change in style from the type of music we all got to know Deep Forest for making.This album sounds like something you'd here backing the soundtrack of the TV show ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not...!"" or the music played on some NBC special featuring a Las Vegas magician while performing some trick. I think I even catch an air of the TV show ""Survivor's"" voting torch ceremony music.Basically, it sounds like mediocre studio music made by people who are just trying to cash their check. I've had few albums that have disapointed me as much as this one did. Avoid it, find a new artist that cares about quality, because obviously the people behind Deep Forest just want the record company to cut them a check when they finish an album."
1,Awful Music Detected,"I am a big Deep Forest fan and I tried to like this horrible cd. I gave it at least 10 full listens and finally gave up and sold it to a used cd shop for a few dollars. It was quite unpleasant to listen to. The first three cds are very enjoyable and the live cd puts it all together, but Music Detected was simply disgusting. I would give it a NO STARS rating if that was an option."
1,This is music???,This album is nothing but disjointed sounds mixed with poorly done vocals. I enjoyed their first album but clearly they have lost whatever ability they once had.
1,Not Commercial,"I had a Lava Tamp. I dropped it. It broke.Enter the RSVP tamper. It looks almost like the Lava Tamp. It says commercial. It fits my commercial machine.Unfortunately, this tamper sucks. I like a convex, not flat tamper, but this is too convex.The main problem is the weight. It's the same weight as an aluminum tamper, but it's distributed all wrong.Don't be fooled by the fact this says ""commercial."" It is not.It's probably fine for the occasional home barista, but for anyone serious about coffee, it's basically a paperweight."
1,well .. they look nice,"Poor product , skimpped on the strap which is way too short , will fit a child's head .Even with all that the extereme pressure on eye sockets , were leaking .Prism doesn't allow to sneak peaks , goggles in general dont feel ""right"" .I had many goggles beofre and have always adjusted but not to this one , gone back to my old Speedos .Strongly advice to try before buying those goggles ."
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought this goggle online, and found it too tight on my face. Changing the nose bridge did not help. The problem comes from the design of the tiny frame which is pressed too closely around my eyes. The gaskets do not provide good cushioning against this pressure. It really hurts. The optical correction part works well. I returned the goggle before even getting it wet.This goggle may fit some people but does not work for me."
2,headband for small heads only,"I purchased this goggle, and to my great disappointment, it doesn't fit on my head without exerting an enormous amount of pressure. If only 3 inches of additional length had been supplied to the headband, there would be no problem. Quite a waste of money!"
3,Eye cups are to small.,"I like these goggles, but they are smaller than the last pair of Speedo opticals. The last pair fit like they were made for me, but this set has smaller eye cups that hurt my eyes."
3,Too small,"It comes with a good quality, but too small for normal face with normal eyes. It may be good for kids under 10 years old. Have to return it."
4,A well-crafted product,"This activity book is bright-colored and well-crafted and sturdy for busy little hands. It claims to have 10 pages, but that is counting the front and back. An older person should supervise the use of this book to help teach the tying, braiding, and weaving skills. The small pieces meant for the puzzle and face decoration might be a choking hazard, but fun for an older child. I plan to give it as a gift to a two-year-old granddaughter."
2,Waste of Money,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. It's way above his age range/capabilities. Before being a parent I thought it looked awesome. Since becoming a parent, it's not for little kids. I seems like it should be for little ones, but it's not. The price is totally not worth the product."
1,Poor quality,"I have the same complaint as all the others. The panel only turns the volume down no matter which button is pressed. Recently, it stopped working all together. I am returning it and will purchase another brand. Beware of this product."
2,"Unfortunately, it's flawed...","As expected the AudioStation sounds very good. However, there are some functional problems that ruin the experience. On the unit both volume controls turn down the sound level. Every time the iPod is turned on while in the Audiostation it defaults to shuffle mode, regardless of how you left it. The power supply brick was unexpected (I hate them) and it's too loose fitting; the plug falls out with the slightest nudge. I have no idea how this product made it through the quality control department!!! Shame on Logitech - drop this failure and start over!"
1,Terrible quality,"Terrible quality, i can not beleive amazon would sell such a horrible quality product.First the case would not unlock, second the tumblers got stuck and could not get it unlocked after setting a code and locking my guns in the case, and third had to break the lock."
2,Broken lock...,Have used this 4 times already and loaded only 3 pistols on one side and 500 rounds of ammo at the other side. The lock is now malfunctioning on one side. Does anyone know the manufacturers information?
3,Difficult to use,"Even though it was easy to install on helmet, the mirror is difficult to use, it has been hard to get used to see through such a small mirror."
3,poor glue... ok mirror..,"I have had this mirror for 3 years and the glue failed. I suppose that's the expected lifetime of this product, but I expected better.I just mounted the mirror not directly in the front part of the helmet but more back and to the left. That gave me a pretty good view to the rear. So my complaint is the glue holding it to my helmet. The mirror is not as good as my current mirror, an eyeglass version by take-along, but that one has the issue of being too low by virtue of being on my eyeglasses. Oh well you pays your money and takes your choice.Any mirror beats no mirror and this one works. Just be prepared to replace it after a while."
3,OK,"Works just fine. However, the wires are about three feet long!!! This means you have to splice these into additional wires. Not very clever. Unless your garage door is two feet tall, these are a pain to fit!!"
2,Liftmaster Safety Beam Kit,"The original beam kit was stolen before I purchased the house. The product arrived sans any real directions. The kit arrived with a two-wire connection which I had to connect to a multiwire outlet. I called the company where a representative tried unsuccessfully to resolve this problem. I finally had to call in a professional. Worse, we used an additional set that had been taped to the top of the opener but which I did not know was a beam set. I now have a unused beam it."
4,It Really works!,"Product came amazinging quick and installation was a breeze. Solved the problem and everybody in house in now happy.One minor consideration is the mounting brackets. I used my 10 year old brackets which were fine (i would not reccommend paying additional money for new brackets) however, the bolt head attachment & the indicator lites are on the same side of the sensor, therefore when you slide the sensor in place, the indicator lite faces inward, toward the inside of the bracket & not outward, so it is barely visably. Seems like the indicator should have been on the opposite side of the sensor. Maybe new brackets are designed differently to display the indicator lite. I'll never know."
1,"High price, low quality - this is what you'll get now.","First time I have bought this bracelet more tan 2 years ago. It was perfect and I used to love it. Until I've lost it one day.Then I decided to buy 2 more of it. But unfortunately I am not happy with the purchase this time. (Note, that the seller is the same and the only.) The metal (silver?) parts of bracelet are in something yellow substance like glue! Moreover, the one of the 2 bracelets I've bought is totally deserves nothing more than to be thrown out. It has defective leather straps. In one place it is torn, in others it is shines with gloss. Very disappointed."
3,Lame and too short!,"OK, first off, Sarah was not the only survivor of that night, we also had Token. He and Sarah both made it through the door since they were not related to anyone from the original massacre, but sadly neither of them appear in this film.Now, the movie plot was very amateurish, and the dialog was lame. Most of the effects were CGI including some very bad kills. Nothing new to see here and I would suggest you watch this only if there is nothing left at the rental house. The running time of the actual movie sans credits is about 1 hour 15 minutes.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
4,Raising Hell,"And putting it to rest.Wow!! This is one of those sequels that fully justify its existence.Kind of rare in some forms of Horror, and not what I was expecting in the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL style. About all I missed in this film was the very stylised jerky ghost moves that characterised the first film. Whilst the Barebones structure of the plot of the search for the Statue, the Quest of Dr Richard Hammer, holds the film together, the carefully detailed death scenes spook the daylights out of anyone watching.There is no commentary in this disc. However, the confessional elements in the features are very unique and cover some different ground in this style of supernatural splatter-fest.And once again, this disc proves that the UNRATED format is the Gold standard."
4,More fun than a barrel of entrails,"You have to get this on BluRay, first of all. Then sit back and watch this ""choose your own adventure"" horror flick and have a blast. It took me and my brother almost four hours to see all the permutations of the ending (as well as the director's version, which includes a coda after the credits). I believe we counted roughly 17 endings. Not all were ""happy,"" but all were in line with the choices we'd made.The story itself is better than you would expect from a b-flick, but don't expect any Oscars(tm) for this one.Pure entertainment and the best use of new technology I've seen since ""follow the white rabbit"" from that other popular sci-fi action flick.If you don't mind a little gore, a little nudity (though not as much as you'd expect), and some cheese with your dialogue and characters, this is a must own for BluRay horror enthusiasts."
5,A Wonderful Collecton,"This is one of the most beautiful and unusual collections of arias I have ever heard. Janet Baker is an extraordinarily intellegent and feeling mezzo soprano, and her interpretations of these love arias is so sensitive and compelling that I never tire of listening to this CD. I particularly love ""Amarilli mia bella,"" though every selection is gorgeous. This is the collection for opera lovers who are tired of the same old selections on every artist collection."
3,"Good chain, but not what is pictured.","The first thing to note is that the chain pictured is not what was sent to me.The chain I received looks like the one pictured here:http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Watch-Chain-Design-Silver-Tone/dp/B000F9770C/ref=sr_1_1?s=watches&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1327235828&sr;=1-1The chain seems to be decent quality and I believe it will hold up well. I chose to give the chain a 3-star ""ok"" review because it is much more plain and in my opinion less appealing than the more unique design pictured. I'm not sure if the chain pictured is what I was supposed to receive or if the wrong picture is being displayed.Regardless, the chain I did get is certainly just as functional. I'm debating weather going through the hassle returning it is worth it."
5,Good show to promote LGBTQI Activism,This is a wonderful movie with great bonus material added of additional interest to viewers which demonstrates the progress LGBT people have made over recent decades. I first saw the film at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts 23rd Annual Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 2007 and was so impressed that I showed it to my church congregation when it came out on DVD in 2008. Everybody loved this film and word about it spread to another church nearby so I loaned them my copy of the DVD so they could see it too. The couple is charming - and after you see it - you wonder why is there any controversy over gay marriage? LGBT love is valid and made all the more so by this couple.
5,Missing link influence between Depth Charge and Octagon Man?,"This album surprised me because it wasn't the kung-fu/porn/soccer/B-movie cutups that I expect and love from Nine Deadly Venoms and Lust 1&2, but it was a clever and easily listenable ""electro"" mix that really proves J. Saul Kane's musical diversity. The re-remix of Scorn's The End (PCM mix) was not what I expected and it was even better than the remix! This CD is a bit of an Anthony Rother homage as well!"
5,Nice Spicy Bay Rum,Pinaud Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum has that old-time barber shop scent and lasts a long time.This is the stuff grandpa used to use and it is still a great scent and a terrific value.
1,Does not smell like any Bay Rum I have ever used.,"I have been using various bay rum products for years, and it does not smell like any bay rum that I have used. It has a very spicy smell, not bay rum. The product stings when you use it. I think that is due to the fact the first item on the ingredient list is alcohol. Lastly, this company never answered the two phone they provide, nor did they ever return my phone call when I left a message asking them to do so."
5,MANLY,This is a MAN's aftershave. I use this after a straight blade shave because the alcohol disinfects the small cuts that I make due to my inexperience. The ensuing burning sensation will knock your SOCKS off. Makes you feel like a MAN! Sweet sassy molasses I'm getting so worked up talking about it that I'm going to go chop something down!
3,Not too bad,"This product is alright. But to me, it smells very simple, mostly just cloves is all I smell. I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh. It has very little lasting power on my skin. I would say it lasts about an hour and then it can no longer be smelled on me. It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice. Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves."
5,Love the theme song!,Our 3 year old and 22 month old love the Davey and Goliath videos. It is super neat to see our daughter understand the themes it is conveying and attempt to put them in to daily practice. Highly recommend for entertainment value and ethics teaching. I like the spiritual themes bc 85% of them aren't your standard christian cliche jesus loves you stuff.
5,My personal favorite Doom/Sorrow Metal band.,"I love this CD. Not as good as their later stuff, but definately worth checking out. Very dark and atmospheric. An extremely pleasing album. Slow, moody, and heavy. It's great. Fans of this should also check out Anaemia and Yeti."
3,PDA MOUNT,Unit does not grip thick PDAs well - had to add brackets to keep iPaq from popping out of the grippers.
4,Strong suction sticks well but vibrates,"The suction cup on this is good; it really sticks to the window, but the unit vibrates on the arm so I have to reach up and stablize it with my hand whenever I want to read the GPS."
4,Works as described,"The mount is very strong when mounted on the window. However, the cradle is rather shaky and not stable. I think this is the older model with one stub on the back to support the cradle. It shakes and wobbles while mounting the phone. It also makes noise when no phone is in it, otherwise, it works as expected but the quality is not as good as I expected, so I am taking one star away."
3,It works but annoying squeaking sound,THe rod is made of aluminum and squeak as you bend it or put your pda into it. Other than that it works fine.
3,Crystal mirror,"Not great. looks kinda cheap in person. I bought it for a gift but decided against giving it because it looked cheap and was only packaged in a clear plastic sleeve, like something you'd buy at a dollar store."
4,"Good quality, but a little small","The mirror is just what I was looking for, except it is a little smaller than I had wanted. Overall Good quality though."
3,"Excellent information, horribly disorganized and written","Joan Mellen takes on the Jim Garrison/Clay Show trial in New Orleans in this highly frustrating book on the JFK Assassination. While she presents much worthwhile information and makes a very strong case that Shaw was a CIA employee involved in the assassination, her conclusions are dragged down in a morass of poor writing. Much is out-of-order chronologically, years are not given to orient the reader, aliases are used interchangeably with real names, etc. The organization at times seems random. All in all, combined with the vast amount of information presented, this ends up being extremely difficult to read.Troublesome also is that Mellen includes well over 100 pages of end notes but many, many quotes and other salient points have no citation listed.Worthwhile, but be prepared to put in a lot of work."
2,Ulitmate Sacrifice blows this book away-not even close!,"In addition to Gary Aguilar, it seems there are others who post favorable reviews because they are all enamored with Miss Mellen. It's not even close---ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IS A MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER BOOK. Get that one instead.Ron Coltrain"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the Model AD400E with Electronic Pump #45 about two years ago. The first one I received was DOA. The company promptly replaced it and paid the shipping. The second one worked OK and pumped the water out of the tank into a laundry sink. The pump was the main selling point for me. The controls were balky and impossible to regulate. It simply ran on high all the time regardless of the setting. I think it was an energy hog. Finally, a few weeks ago, it started leaking on the floor. The dehumidifier was apparently working, but not the pump. There is no alternative way of emptying the tank. I tried to open the cabinet to see if I could repair it, but it is not designed for easy service. So now I have a 50-pound piece of scrap metal in my basement and the humidity is rising. I have tried to contact the company but the numbers I have for it are no longer working. I would stay away from this model and this company."
1,poor longevity; poor controls,I purchased this 6/14/08 and it is already irrevocably broken and i have to buy a new one (soleus 40 pint is MUCH better). the controls never really worked as advertised. the instructions are dreadful and completely unhelpful. it leaked a few times (and the bucket was all the way in). Very noisy (the soleus is quiet). and it lasted only a year and i don't even use it in the winter. i will never purchase from this company again.
1,Scorpio With no Stinger,"The hit song, Scorpio, is not the original version on this CD and it sounds like something recorded in the basement of a crack house. Quite frankly, I have never been more disappointed with a CD I purchased from Amazon -- and I've purchased hundreds of them -- than this one. Don't waste your money."
5,An amazing book,"Ethel G. Stewart was roundly beaten up on by her fellow academics when she first published this book. Yet today, new evidence and, importantly, genetics, are backing up her early theories. Whether time proves Stewart to be 100% accurate or merely 75% accurate is almost irrelevant. What is most crucial here is that this is the tale of a woman who dedicated her life to important research, stood by her findings, and was made to suffer dearly. And as it turns out, she was almost certainly right. Thank God she is still alive to see all the ""new"" discoveries that are validating her work. We need more like her in academia."
2,Cheap looking,Two words: Cheap looking! I wouldn't have bought this if it was in a store and I could see it before buying it.
4,Non Fiction,"The Star Trek Compendium is an episode guide to Star Trek that is very well done. The episode lists and information appear to be quite accurate and informative, at least to my non-expert self. There is an introduction and some background to the Star Trek phenomenon as well. Anyone with interest should be happy with this."
5,Another must for all trekkies,This book covers all of the episodes of the Original Series and all of the movies up to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. A great reference book for even those who only just care for the Original Series but prefer the later serieses (like me!).
2,A good study bible for the average reader,"I bought this study bible for my wife. I found it simplistic, and opinionated. The beginner Bible student that wants to be told what to think would profit from this text. I find that a good Hebrew - Greek - English interlinear Bible is much more accurate and thought provoking. Of course it would be for advanced students of the Bible.The Interlinear Bible: Hebrew-Greek-English"
2,Does not have plug jacks,The has a few jacks and many receptacle but not round plug jacks. The picture is so small you can't tell what you are buying. Also hard to tell which voltage level it's on. If you buy this anyway I suggest also getting a multimeter so you can verify what voltage its set on. Poorly designed and not as universal as ad claims.
4,Beethoven as seen by Mahler,"The Fifth on this disk is the arrangement by Gustav Mahler. AFAIK there is no other recording of it. Mahler ""retouched"" the score to bring out subtle parts that he felt had been lost in the change from the small orchestra and audience of Beethoven's day to the larger orchestra and listening space of Mahler's time (and today). Basically Mahler doubled the woodwinds and horns, and changed a number of dynamic markings. I have not heard this CD yet, but heard this arrangement played by the Cleveland Orchestra at Blossom Music Center, a venue of 10,000. Mahler's arrangement certainly does bring out some parts that you cannot hear in the original, but a few parts, especially the piccolo runs and trills, are changed from subtle to over-the-top. Shades of J. P. Sousa. An interesting musical study."
3,Nazi Robot Weapons,"During WWII the German Army experimented with remote-controlled tanks, first as a minesweeper option and later to deliver explosives against armor and fixed targets. While the experiments were primitive they did show promise.This volume is the only book on this topic I have ever seen. As such it does have some good photos and some limited background information but it seems to be missing info which would put it in context. With this book's limitations it just leaves you wanting more."
5,"McCarthy was right, but Truman did them more damage!","It was fascinating to learn the real story of the Cold War. While Joe McCarthy was right about the number of Communists in the U.S. Government, Harry Truman did more damage to the Communist cause.Learn the true origin of the ""RATS"" of the ""DemocRATS"" controversy of the last Presidential election, and speculate on what kind of people would think it was offensive. Learn the true origin of ""polictical correctness"" and speculate on what kind of people would apply it today.All in all, Herb's book is a great read, and its implications are far reaching."
5,Great Book,"I'm a linux newbie trying to explore its powerful features and experimenting with open source technology. This book is a great help for me as a linux newbie in setting up a mail server. Howeer, just make sure you visit the website of this book because there are many corrections. I hope an improved version of the book will be released soon."
5,Great smell & a great price!Buy it!,"I would buy it again. I like the masculine smell a lot and it is like a cologne/parfume, it stays with you for a long time and you can sense it all the time. It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this. You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)! I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older. Do not hesitate on buying it, because it is cheap and smells great."
2,meh...,I didn' t like the scent too much. That's the risk of ordering online. But my Dad liked it so I gave it to him.
3,Old Spice?,"Am I the only person here who thinks this stuff smells just like Old Spice? Although I don't have anything against Old Spice (it kind of reminds me of my dad), I think we should call it what it is. Maybe I will try the vanilla and lime scents."
1,318T only works with one receiver,I bought this unit because it said indoors/outdoors. I wanted one for outdoors. I also read the other reviews.....including the reviews saying easy to add to your system.........well my system is the skylink SC1000. so this motion sensor is not compatible with it. I would like skylink and amazon to advertise that this sensor is only compatible with the 318R receiver. Please do so with all the accessories. By the way my sc1000 works well. good system.
4,Works Very Well,Bought this product to sense the back and front doors of the residence. Put control on bedside stand. Now have security alarm for these two entrances. Feel more secure at night. The units are easy to set up and work as advertised.
5,Great book,This one is almost as good as Computers For Dummies. I must read for anyone wishing to increase their understanding of computers.
2,Shocks do not come precompressed,"These may be very good shocks, but they don't ship precompressed which makes them near impossible to install yourself. I am a strong guy and could not get the shocks to compress more than about an inch. Spring compressors are too big for this item. Be warned, the driveway mechanic may be stymied by these shocks."
3,This book is useful only if you lack the original manual.,"Unfortunately, this handbook doesn't go much beyond the user guide that comes with PageMill. If you want in-depth information that doesn't just mimic the manual, I'd look elsewhere. It's not worth the money."
5,Dad is out in the Lawn!!!,"My dad needed a long reach hose, but didn't want to deal with the mess of the regular hoses (YOU KNOW TO PUTT AWAY AND UNDOING KNOTS)so I saw this recoil hose we had own one before but not this thick and strong, he is happy with this product, strongly recommend it."
3,Coiled garden hose,"Having a coiled garden hose seems like a great idea. However, be aware that you will need to be careful to keep the coils for tangling. Additionally, stretching the hose around corners where annuals are planted requires care since you could damage those plants. This product may work best in a garage for washing cars, etc."
5,A JEWELRY,"This is my favorite book. It reavels in colors, chiaroscuro, just about everything that I like to see over and over on it.Pictures of Monet's house at Giverny, and other sites are singular: its shows us ordinary details that makes beauty.It's not a book about decoration, design or style as it could be supposed to be taken for. It's a work of art wrapping history, life style.I could learn on this book as I can delight myself and look for inspiration."
3,"Nice features, short on durability","The pull out spout is a feature that I have found to be a really good one. You can fill a pot sitting on the counter next to the sink, fill a mop bucket on the floor in front of the sink, rinse a large vessel by directing the flow of the nozzle around the vessel rather than trying to fit it under a spout and move it around. However, after three years, the push button between stream and spray just produces a half and half mixture of stream and spray. Also, the strainer has to be cleaned frequently (a fairly easy job) because flakes of black stuff stop it up. I think it is from the inside of the pull out hose. This is the only faucet in the house where I find this black stuff. The main valve seems to be holding up well so far - no leaks to outside, no drips, and smooth operation."
4,Emmylou's 1981 classic!,"Yes, this puppy is still not available on CD - Why? I suppose you'd have to ask Warner Brothers. 1981 Offering from Emmylou ranks right up there with her best - Covering tunes from the likes of Rodney Crowell, John Fogerty, Robbie Robertson, James Taylor, Gram Parsons, Bill Payne and Pat Ballard - tracks are - I Don't have to Crawl, High High the Moon, Spanish Johnny, Bad Moon Rising, Evangeline, Hot Burrito #2, Millworker, Oh Atlanta, Mister Sandman, Ashes By Now - C'mon WB, get with it already!"
1,Loaded With Gimmickry & Gadgets,"Contrary to the previous review, I don't find Ms.Airey that proficient in Photoshop. Much of her artistic successes come from ""Happy Surprises"" in experimenting with various software and hardware. Which brings me to my next point. Be prepared to spend $1,000+ on such things as Nik Color Effects, AutoFX Photographic Edges, Wacom tablets and last but not least Studio Artist, which is only made for a Mac. So you'll need a Mac too if you want to try any of her ""experiments"". Nearly half the book is devoted to ""Studio Artist"" Inserts written by her compatriate artists use photoshop more than Ms. Airey. Some of her techniques are ""way out there"". I may as well bought a book written by Rembrandt on ""How to Paint Pictures"""
2,Boaring,"I was not impressed. It seamed old, outdated, and the art was basic at best. I would say keep looking there are MUCH better books on Amazon about the subject."
5,Get Clients Now!,This is a great book. I've learned so much about changing my mindset to help me think about how I can do to build a strong business. I'm excited to implement what I've learned to generate revenue for my business.
2,It's exactly what you think it's going to be,"This book is set in an absolutely atrocious font that would perhaps be better suited for a title on Tarot card reading, or Angels, or pretty much anything other than marketing. The leading is also sub-optimal, making it very physically difficult to actually get your eye to move across the page. The fact that what's on said page is a lot of redundant, pandering fluff doesn't help matters at all.Like most self-help books, this one spends several chapters defining a couple of catchphrases in language that is so simplistic as to be patronizing, and then spends several more chapters repeating them over and over and over. There is literally over 100 pages worth of forgettable feel-good setup to wade through before you even get to the actual point of the book. What the reader is supposed to learn from any of this, I have no idea, but all I learned was that I hate the author and her pipeline-filling action plan menu full of success ingredients."
3,Could not read it,"I bought this book over Book Yourself Solid, based on reviews of both. I started reading GCN when it arrived and put it down quickly. Picked it up a time or two and read a page or two and it just didn't click. It was only after I finished a publication design class and came back to the book that it struck me--GCN is set in a display typeface (which one I don't know) that makes it excruciatingly difficult for me to read.I honestly can't say whether the advice is any good or not. I am someone who flies through books; when they are well-designed, it's not uncommon to read two a night. There are a dozen books in this genre (BYS being just one) that are much easier to read, and therefore absorb.I wish I had recognized the problem with the typeface three months ago."
4,"Not Easy, but worth the challenge!","I did not have much experience with paper folding, so the designs in this book are quite a challenge. Most diagrams are easy to figure out but there are several which had steps missing from them, but in general they are easy to understand, though by no means easy to fold, since this book seems like its targeted at the more experienced people intersted in origami. Of the designs that I managed to make, they did come out exactly as they looked in the book, and the unique concept of using not square pieces of paper but pentagons, hexagons and octagons, is really an eye opener."
5,Excellent Read,"I purchased this book shortly after receiving my promotion to be a sales manager and I was very pleased. While the authors do repeat themselves on some topics, the book is otherwise excellent and a fast read."
2,Not the most practical mittens,"My newborn throws her hands in her face over and over when she's upset. I am constantly using mittens to try and protect her cute little face from her nails. I've tried 4 different brand of mittens. I know these have a hole for the thumb but it just doesn't seem practical to me. There's no way she'd keep the mittens on her hand with the ""thumb"" hole option. I also find the mittens to be a bit small. The elastic needs to be a bit tighter in the mitten so that they don't fall off so often."
2,Why?,"A tribute to Joni had all the possibilites to be a favorite in any Mitchell fans' CD collection. After all, the 2000 Tv special that featured Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Diana Krall and others was probably the most entertaining special I've seen in this decade. So having that for a seed how could this not be awesome? Well the simple answer is that it was designed to be too complicated, on the edge or whatever. Some of the performances are awesome! (Prince, E. Harris, KD Lang and JT) but some are almost unbareable and prevent any listener who is not familiar with the particular song to even understand what the heck its about. Music fans purchase at your own risk, but understand that few true Joni fans will think its a tribute or a treasure."
3,Bits and pieces are interesting,"I can't figure a good reason to buy a tribute CD unless the artist does a cover that's somehow different or better.""A Case of You,"" by Prince qualifies as different. It's soulful and contemporary and in no way sounds like Joni. ""Dreamland"" by Caetano Veloso has a wonderful Latino flair. ""Edith and the Kingpin"" may not have been written for Elvis Costello, but I think he made it his own now.""Magdelene Laundries"" by Emmylou Harris is probably the one song I'd say was done better on the CD. It's gritty and her harsher voice lends to the hard realities of the song, whereas 'the chirp' doesn't quite convey what I expect to hear from a woman in that situation.I've heard the CD in its entirety, but I've only gotten the cuts mentioned above. Those, to me, truly are 'tributes.'"
1,A Festival of Excrement,"Come, brethren, let us rejoice that the ""artist"" who is the subject of this book is dead. The world is better off without fraudsters like him cluttering up the galleries of the world with their infantile scribble. This is the lowest of the low. The worst artist of the twentieth century. And that's saying a lot, considering that the whole point of art in the twentieth century was that anyone could do it. I only hope that my good friend Grabowski can make some comment on my review so that I can be assured of its propriety."
3,Narita Air Pot Pump Hot water Dispense,The water has a funny taste to it. It is not boiling hot but does OK for making hot choc or tea or even instant coffee.
4,"Sharp LC-20S1UB 20"" AQUOS Flat-Panel EDTV-Ready LCD TV","The Sharp Aquos TV has great picture quality. I have mine sitting next to a window and the light coming in does not produce a glare on the screen. I am so pleased that I am looking for a larger model. The only complaint I have, thus only 4 stars, is that the speaker watt size is not sufficient for this model."
4,"Good product, bad rabbit","Seems like a good product. Mine stays warm all the time instead of just when an animal is in contact with it (which is what I gathered from the product info). The only defect in the system is that my rabbit doesn't use it, I guess she has plenty of fur to survive the normally non-freezing conditions where we live."
5,Perfect for our needs,"We bought this to make our guinea pig more comfortable as he recovered from a URI, and are keeping it in the cage for the rest of the winter even though they are indoor piggies. This never gets hot...it's a perfect cozy warmth for the pigs to cuddle up on. We have several houses for them, and placed one of them over this...and it's pretty clear which house they prefer now! I'm not sure how effective this would be for outdoor use, since it's only just over 100 degrees, but it certainly couldn't hurt. I am very happy with this product."
4,Almost perfect,This is very small which works for the cat condo. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is rigid-hard as a floor. The cats prefer my older one but needed two so ordered this one. Not sure why they don't like it other than it is so hard.
5,Love It,"I got this to put in a cat shelter for a neighbor's cat that was banished to the outdoors last winter (for spraying inside the house). Even though my neighbor said she had a cozy place for the cat to sleep, we would see and hear him under a bush outside in very cold weather, meowing pitifully. I recently bought a feral cat shelter and this pad. (I originally was going to put this pad in a styrofoam cooler, but couldn't find such a cooler in one piece.) I had to drill a slot in the door of the shelter I bought to make an opening to get this rigid pad inside, but now it works in there perfectly. It took some doing to introduce the cat to the shelter, as he's gotten more skittish in his outdoor life, but once I got him to check it out (with tuna outside and catnip inside) he seems totally into it. When I peek inside, I see him sitting directly on the pad. It got into the teens here last night, and I slept more soundly knowing the cat was cozy in his new heated house."
3,Great for a sick ferret,"We volunteer as a permanent foster home for a ferret rescue... this means that we get palliative ferrets at our home; this heating pad helps keep sick ferrets warm without burning or over heating them and, at the same time, it is smooth and flat making it easy for them to leave if they need to. We have found that after some use, it started buzzing - not sure why this is, but it stops us from giving it a higher review. We also have the heated cuddle sac by K&H which does not buzz and stays nicely warm and cozy - we use it for our bald adrenal ferrets in the winter and they love it."
4,Heated mat for Small Animals,I am pleased with the product. I especially like that the cord has metal around it for the first 6 feet or so. I lease it on 12 hrs a day at this time and see no increase in my electric bill. I use this mat outdoors for my feral cats that I feed. I would recommend it for that purpose without question.
2,Hope for better...,I'm hoping there is a much better dvd of Barry out there. This was seems like it was almost like a rehearal show. I was rather disappointed in this show.
1,Poor stitching - beware of falling sequins!,I wrote to Matisse Shoewear and enclosed the shoes. They never contacted me. Very poor customer service.
1,Piece of junk,Looks good and sturdy but only has about 15 feet of line and no way to replace it. It broke the first time my son used it. Don't waste your money. Very disappointing product.
3,scarde cat,sister bear was having a school paly and she got her part and she was afrad so she got stage fright.
1,Horrible Service,Never received the item. Lost in shipping and was not able to re-order due to item being out of stock. I was charged for item and had to request credit for item that never shipped. Avoid this vendor!
4,Good Piece of Equipment So Far,"I purchased this and as of this moment have only used it three times. However, it worked just fine. It has a very sturdy construction and despite other reviews stating they had difficulty getting the tools apart/to come off I had no issues at all. The trick is to slide them apart, not just grab and pull to get them apart. Besides that slight learning curve, its a great tool to have!"
3,Bike Tool,A good product but slightly difficult to separate the 2 parts. Tyre levers are not brilliant either! But all in all not a bad piece of kit!
4,Bulky but cool,"I bought this mostly for the cool look (my trike is red) and pricepoint. I hadn't realized how bulky it was though. Even though it's a piece of art, it doesn't fit in a pocket easily and may take up more space in a bag when put together like in the photo. I suppose you could pull it apart when storing. The tire levers are super strong and curved with soft edges as to not puncture your tubes while changing them out. I've used the chain link remover and it works fine. No complaints. Seems like a quality product. The two grey pieces (not black) may be tough to take apart by hand the first few times while it's still bring broken in. You can always use the lever to pry them apart."
1,Never again will I buy this product!,"First of all, it was delivered in un-working condition. The spray part of the product would not work at all. I had to screw off the lid and glob it into my hand to use it. I have now gone through the entire bottle (I don't like to waste money) and my experience is that what it did cover got hard and crunchy yet also left certain spots still frizzy. I am willing to admit that perhaps it's because the product was globbed like a normal gel as opposed to being sprayed on as it was supposed to be and so perhaps my experience was just doomed to begin with and the product might not be too bad. Either way though, I will not bother trying it again."
3,Disappointed by this bland debut novel,"I studied at Berklee College of Music and so was very interested to read this novel, about a young woman who struggles with the direction of her musical career. Although some of the peripheral characters were interesting, I found the main character, Gala, annoyingly whiney and her insights on music familiar, and the story itself -- since it revolved around Gala's self-absorption -- not terribly compelling. I felt like the author stayed on very safe territory. Despite some nice writing, this book was not worth the money."
1,Did not work,Were no better than batteries I was replacing.Do not think these batteries were new or maybe old not very happy
4,Best tea ever,My sister in law brought some of this when she came to visit and it's wonderful. Apparently it's a favorite in England. If you don't like full body strong tea you won't like it. Didn't know where I would be able to find it. Should have know Amazon would come to the rescue
4,one child life span,"I loved this stroller with my first child. When she was 20 lbs and I could no longer carry her in a sling we got this. We've only ever done city walking in it. It's great over crubs, cobble stone streets, city park trails. I liked how the front wheel swiveled and being tall it's a great height. Now with my 2nd child and 4 years later I'm going to have to buy a new stroller. I can't use the front wheel swivel anymore. The back tire keeps going flat no matter how many times we bring it into the bike shop to get aligned and new tire tubes. It's a great stroller and I loved using it. Just dont expect it to stand up to time and possible other children you may have."
4,Great Stroller,"We love our Instep Safari and how smooth a ride it is for our grandchild. The only thing that kept me giving it five stars is how heavy it is. Other than that, great purchase."
3,Brake slips on,"This stroller is everything I wanted except that as the stroller vibrates with impact and motion, the brake bar slips slightly down on the rear tires, causing drag on the wheels. It is frustrating to constantly be lifting up the brake bar with my foot as I hike or walk the beach or even stroll around town. I wish the brake bar could be ""locked"" in the ""off"" position, if desired. In defense of the company and product, I have not had time to call them and ask about this problem."
5,"A horrifying film; much, much better than ""Atomic Cafe""","Radio Bikini captures the earth-shattering tragedy of the Bikini tests, in ways you are probably not prepared for. Unlike other books and documentaries on the subject, it does not attempt to be too clever -- but lets the story unfold in a way that really can leave no one with any doubt as to the terrible new world America found itself in, and helped create after the cessation of WWII. I understand why we embarked on this path, but the inability of Americans then and now to deal with the human side of warfare is extremely disturbing."
2,Disorientation blues,"Liner notes? Maybe a little booklet about the musicians being anthologized? Or at least the year the song was recorded? Well how about none of the above?! And why would someone want to spend money (admittedly, not very much) for a collection of 200 ""legendary blues treasures"" without some contextual guidance? Most of the songs are actually quite incapable of providing aesthetic pleasure, and the laziness of the compilers denies us the historical pleasure of at least knowing what we're supposed to be hearing! This product will disappoint if you are not already a blues expert."
1,Over Priced - Quality Fair - and disclosure of this product is lacking,"The quality of the product is fair, more of a let down. It did work but not like the picture leads you to believe it will work. Not even close.Disclosure: Their ad fails to mention that their product is a very ugly grey and that you have to purchase a very expensive pigment to color it. Then when you purchase the pigment you find out you need to purchase two of them, so you run up a pretty costly bill before you done.Would I recommend this to my friends? NO!Steer clear of this stuff!"
4,Serious yet funny. A masterpiece,"I liked ""The Last burden"" better than English August and I liked English August very much. I discussed the book with one of my friends who had read it and remarked to him ""This book should get a booker."" He said ""It will be a million years before they give bookers to books like these"". He was absolutely right. It's not the material that bookers are made up of. It transcends that. For one its shockingly vulgar. Even more than The Liar(Stephen Fry) and English August. However I think Chatterjee loves to show off. Every other page there was a word that I had seen for the first time. I can't recommend this book to you or otherwise because I don't know what sort of books you like. I can only speak for myself and I liked the book very much."
4,A wealth of information and great pictures,"Wonderful book, needs a little updating though. All in all provides a lot of information from it's early days to the 90's. Pictures make it worth while."
5,answers included,"This is a good textbook. Well organized, examples follow every new idea. Examples are not fully worked out, probably presuming readers know how to do them. Problems at the end of each chapter have answers included. I found this extremely helpful."
5,Jag Addict,I will also continue to purchase Jag on dvd. I have purchased season 5 and cannot wait until season 6 is released now . I never get tired of the shows!
1,Great concept-poor execution,"Fogless lasted about 4 weeks - still useable if one treats it like a swim mask lense; a bit of spit or soapy water followed by a rinse clears it long enough for a shave.At 5 weeks, the razor-activated light switch was intermittent but repeatedly storing and removing the razor eventually activates the lights so it's still useable.At 10 weeks the zoom feature stopped working but was zoomed to where I like it so it's still useable.At 11 weeks the clock failed. Didn't want to know what time it was anyway.At 13 weeks, the lights flicker intermittently, the zoom feature and clock have failed and I'm tired of cleaning the mirror ahead of each shave. No longer useable.Great design ideas but lousy execution. I'd pay $50 plus if this were built well and reliable."
1,very poor quality: features stop working after a couple months,"Everything starts out fine, then the light won't go off until the battery is dead, then liquid gets in the battery compartment and the batteries corrode, then the power mirror doesn't work. Can't say that the mirror was ever fogless, even following their instructions. We still use it because the mirror conveniently locked up at full magnification, we have plenty of sunlight in our shower area, and we rub soap on the mirror, then rinse, to manually make it ""fogless."" However, if we ever bought a new shower mirror, it would definitely NOT be this product."
3,The magnification is nice but...,The lights stopped working after a couple of months and I really wanted the light more than the magnification...
3,This is not a technical manual.,"If you are looking for a how to manual, this is not it. It is ,however, a very good source of ideas. It really does have 1001 tips. Some are very extravagent, and some are simple adjustments. But it is just a starting point. It leaves you to fill in the rest."
1,Newer but not better versions of their best stuff,"I thought this was a greatest hits collection but, instead, it sounds like a reworked set of their hits. The newly recorded versions are lacking, I much prefer the originals.Don't buy this."
1,save your money,Nothing is wrong with the CD except that I did not read the liner notes.I assumed this was a live recording fron the TroubadourIt is not . It is just a compliation of studio recordings that one has heard a million times before.Buy the songs from an online service like itunes or Amazon and you will save.Nothing special just misleading packaging
2,"Wonderful watch, lousy watchband","I bought this watch in August 2007, and I was very pleased with the overall appearance. However, I soon discovered I could not wear the watch every day--the leather watchband acquired a really obnoxious, foul odour after a couple of hours of wear. The leather reacted with the perspiration from my wrist. I usually have metal watchbands, but this watch was so handsome with its black leather and studs that I didn't try to change it. I have discovered there is such a thing as a 'waterproof' wristband that doesn't smell. Stuhrling could have waterproofed their leather watchband, which would have prevented the problem in the first place. I'm rather unhappy about having to shell out money to correct an avoidable problem."
5,Muy excellent band and performers,"I stumbled upon one of their shows and then bought the record when it came out. Very glad I did both things. Maybe a bit of a Stooges vibe on some of their stuff, but wouldn't say ""influenced by"" because who knows. They really pour themselves into their playing and performances. Certainly they don't miss not having a bass player. The record has a good thick sound, very tight. Get it if you're a fan of unbridled anti-mainstream rock done with no pretensions. They are wild and creative and deserve to be stars, which they are in my book. Go FW!"
1,Overpriced!!!,"Redicoulously, insanely priced!!! This kind of pricing is reason for hacking!! It is ok to be greedy, but this is redicoulously outrageous!! Seeing this type of pricing on a silly DVD makes you reflect on our banking crisis and understand the sentiment that drove it. $20 would be maybe fair, but it is difficult to find words for one DVD costing more than three times that!!! My parents owed this to somebody so I had to buy it somewhere, had an hacked version been available to me I would not have hesitated."
1,Singer and songwriting not good.....,"Having never heard Annihilator and based on my respect for Amazon reviewers tastes(giving this album a 5 star average).I had high hopes before listening to this,the key word being ""had"". The band is good but the singer and lyrics S.T.I.N.K.!! No wonder I never heard of them before.How can someone rate this album 5 stars with lyrics like this? I was literally cringing the whole time I was playing this. I would be embarrassed to play this for my friends or blast it in my car. ""Phoneix Rising"" is a decent ballad but that's the end of the praise. It's not so much that the lyics in and of themselves are bad,but it's the way they are sung by this guy, just terrible! Anyway if you don't believe me, take a chance and buy the album...you have been warned."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I wasn't very happy with the layout of this book. It seemed to be a collection of testimonies and ramblings about the authors experiences. What I was looking for was a guide to the cleanse and some hard facts as to what was happening during the cleanse. Not just some guys experiences? Anyway, I found what I needed to know online, and the book is headed to the thrift store..."
5,military detox!,"I have completed this fast twice - the first time with my soldier husband before he deployed and the second time with a soldier friend before she deployed! The biggest challenge for me was having to prepare meals for our children while not eating with them! So I have to admit, misery did love the company! Both times I did the fast using just the website for advise but I ended up ordering the book for myself and another friend who is wanting to do the cleanse! This book is so practical, easily read and understood! Knowledge is power and having everything explained will help give the motivation to keep on with it and see it through! My husband and I plan to do this again when he gets home from Afghanistan, and I will be so glad to have the book to refer to the next time around!!!"
4,Master Cleanse options,"The master cleanse is a great way to help get rid of your toxic cravings (sugar, caffeine, etc). It is amazing of how much stuff your body retains in our easy to get processed food world. You will feel so much better and hopefully choose better foods after the cleanse. I highly recommend trying it and see for yourself."
4,It Works!!!,"My wife and I had both done the Master Cleanse before reading this book. However, Glickman's book gives practical and personal insights into how to succeed on the MC. It answered a lot of my questions and gave me great encouragement to keep pressing on through the entire 10 days.Reading the section where people describe their poop was quite entertaining. I think some of those who posted on the bulletin board seem obsessed with their daily eliminations. Both my wife and I laughed at the varied descriptions.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wanted to start the Master Cleanse!"
4,Unbelievable results - and I went in a skeptic!,"Honest to gosh, I fully expected to fail, but (ALSO ""honest to gosh""!) I didn't. Not sure I understand all the science behind it, but I DID stick it out for the full 10 days I planned on, and didn't feel faint or weak at all. I'd recommend this as an exercise in discipline if nothing else, and the cleansing and weight loss (12 pounds for me) was just a bonus!"
4,Do this cleanse - use this book!,"There are many cleanses out there, but no other is as straightforward, inexpensive, and gives you such results. This book will help you through those very tough times, and explain what is actually going on in your body. The book is not complicated in the least. The author is not a doctor, so you are not bogged down by scientific language that you may not need or want. If you are ready for a cleanse go this route."
3,Informative...,The book is informative and it gives you information on what'll happen to your body doing the cleanse--which is very important so one doesn't become scared and abandon the wonderful work his/her body is doing to cleanse itself of impurities.
2,Consolidated Book from the website,"I was excited about doing this fast/cleanse. I read the book in one nite and it helped to make sure I had all the right ingredients and was clear about being strict about following the ingredients to a tee. Most of the book were testimonials that you can find on his website.While I made it through 5.5 days of the cleanse, I realized that the program was not for me and that there were other ways to cleanse. I did feel better, but didn't enjoy the experience."
3,Interesting,"After reading the book, I chose not to do this fast, but I'm sure it gets rid of the toxins. The only problem I have with it is that my system is very acidic...so I chose not to follow this fast."
5,Easy to Read!,"I've been doing the Master Cleanse off and on for over 7 years and love it! Additionally, I have a copy of Stanley Burroughs' book. However, when I heard about Peter Glickman's book I felt I should have it on my shelf as well. It's very easy to read; I finished it in only 2 hours. The back-and-forth dialogue that he includes from his website's bulletin board is very nice. It's helpful to read accounts of other folks doing the cleanse. Another great aspect to the book is the numerous helpful websites and books that Glickman makes mention of. I'm so eager to do the Master Cleanse again (very soon)! This time I want to go past 10 days for the first time. I want to see a pink tongue!"
4,Very Good primer on this cleansing fast,"I've done a fair amount of fasting before reading this book and did my first Master Cleanse after skimming the original Burroughs book. Especially for anyone new to fasting and cleansing, this is excellent. A tad redundant at times, but since it seems so many people have trouble keeping it simple,the repetition of some key points is likely worthwhile. Personally i don't think the timeline of physical feelings and reactions to the MC as presented is nearly as scientifice and typical as the author indicates, but it is important to know that there are phases and stages and that any fast has physically challenging moments that are part of the larger healing process. Definitely a good modernization of the original text and the corresponding web site is chock full of good questions and a variety of responses."
2,All of this information is available online,"I thought this book would provide me with information not available online - I was wrong. This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, and there are a bunch of great websites that explain this cleanse in just as much detail. No need to buy the book."
4,Very informative,"This was a very informative book that I read right before the MC. Light on the science behind the cleanse, but will surely let you know what to expect. I appreciated knowing what others experienced."
3,it's not for everyone!,"This book was informative, especially if you are doing the Master Cleanse for the first time. It fleshes out some of the details mentioned in the strangely written original book by Stanley Borroughs, and it includes lots of support via questions and answers from hundreds of people who were doing the Cleanse. It's not a completely coherent read, and it's a bit on the extreme side of the spectrum if you ask me...before you get too far into the book you will feel compelled to go on a raw vegetable/nut/seed diet for the rest of your life. But that's just my opinion, and I'm a fairly health-conscious person who read both books, then tried the Master Cleanse and only lasted 4.5 days."
2,Not impressed,"Besides the packaging being almost impossible to open and giving me a nasty cut on my finger, the holder is very ridged and not practical. It's very difficult to install a new kitchen roll without damaging the roll because there's no give in the holder arms.I don't recommend this product at all.Alex"
4,Don't forget the screws!,"There's not much to say about this... it's a one-piece paper towel holder. It looks good, is well crafted, and does the job.But if you're mounting it under a cabinet (as opposed to the wall) make sure you have screws that are short enough on hand. The underside of my cabinets are only 0.6"" thick. The screws this comes with are 1"" long.The good news is that shorter screws work equally well at keeping this secure. You just have to bring your own to the party."
1,Poor Design,"I wish I had paid more attention to the one and two star reviews regarding this product. Yes, it's a beautiful stainless steel look, but good design it is NOT! The holder is so rigid you have to cram the roll into place, which ends up mangling the cardboard, creating a very off balance situation. Because of this, one has to really pull at the paper towel, many times causing it to rip just a small piece off at a time. The holder was only $16 bucks so it's not worth returning, and I'm actually still using it (I'm lazy, okay?), but trust me - this is very bad design and not worth the hassle."
3,This has some good numbers on it,"But it was not as awe inspiring as, say, Led Zeppelin's ""Earlier Days"" and ""Latter Days"" CDs. It's something that is listenable, but not that I've returned to listen to again and again. In a nutshell, it's worth about a second hand purchase price."
3,Who needs Bond?,The British would have sent James Bond to break up these high tech villains. The Japanese definitely do one better! This adventure is complete with beautiful tropical maidens and evil facist crooks bent on conquering the world. I liked it!
3,SUBTITLED,"The movie is in Japanese, with English subtitles below. If you like just watching the movie, it's not bad. Having to read during the whole thing will give you a headache. I prefer the old ""DUBBED"", voice-over type. The original beginning has been cut off in this one."
5,Fun Godzilla Movie & a Great Comedy! Very Colorful!,"This Godzilla movie was made more as a comedy than a dramatic one. It has some great jokes and fun fight scenes! Remember: Godzilla's fighting a lobster; not a shrimp as some movie critics say. Some Facts About this Movie: It was originally supposed to star the Toho King Kong! (King Kong vs. Godzilla) This one stars Akira Takarada who played Ogata in Godzilla, King of the Monsters, and Sakai in Godzilla vs. Mothra. Enjoy!"
3,They edit many cartoons scenes.,"I already have a disapointment with this new 2007 Voltron's DVD series. They removed all deaths, kicks in the nuts(by the princess), bloodsheds and then repeat scenes of people running to fill up the space. In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.Anything else, not bad at all(special features). By the way, DO NOT spect the same chapter order, just in case."
1,"Terrible, just terrible.","""Voltron"": It's where little people are aliens, the Japanese and death don't exist, and English-sounding fantasy names MUST be replaced with other English-sounding fantasy names. This dub is an insult: It's offensive to the original creators and writers, and to the intelligence of its audience. The makers of this dub wanted to present a PG-13 rated anime to a younger audience, but ""GoLion"" was not edited for violence with artistic integrity, and common sense, in mind. The dubbing team wanted to present their own show without going to the expense of animating it themselves. It's quite sad that so much effort was put into restoring the old dub for new release, when they could have released a new, decent, faithful dub. Buy the uncut ""GoLion"" on DVD. See the anime as it was meant to be seen."
4,great ka Bar product.,"took this knife out camping. It was good as a light duty chopper. What this knife really excels at it slicing and cutting. I was able to make feather sticks with ease and prepare meals with it as well.Too bad Ka Bar discontinued this little gem. I also own it's big brother the Heavy Duty Warthog, which Ka Bar still makes.I would definitely recommend this knife."
1,What The Fudge!?,awful! just awful! nail clipper isn't sharp enough to clip my nail. knife isn't sharp enough to even cut a string. LED light isn't bright enough even in pitch black room. I threw it out just 5 minutes after opening the package. not even worth returning it.
5,Awesome item!!!,Ok so! I bite my nails a lot and I needed clippers that I could take with me everywhere and I found these. I was incredibly hesistant to buy them because of the bad reviews that it was receiving. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THIS ITEM IS GREAT!!! Seriously I don't know if the other people were using them wrong or bought an older version but please don't listen to them! I really think this thing is handy and the clipeprs work great. At the most you lose a couple of bucks! Not kidding this item is no where near as bad as it got cracked up to be!
4,No Issues,"Good movie, my nephew loves it. No issues with the actual movie in streaming and would recommend this if you have children between the ages of 5-9 who love adventures."
3,Arthur & the Invisibles,"This is not the full screen version that is available in other languages. We saw it in Russian and ordered it in English expecting to see what we had seen. When some scenes were missing, we were very disappointed."
2,"Great Film, Bad DVD","When I origionally saw this film in the cinema, it was great! full of action and the jokes where quite witty.Unfortunatly this dvd version has been censored to a point where quite a few of the action sequences have been cut out and the film just dosn't flow.The film cuts from diferent scenes, missing out sections that leave the viewer quite puzzled about how the characters got to the point they are at.I don't understand why they would censor an animated film that is rated PG anyway.All in All if you can get your hands on the origional version its a must!but for the time beeing I'd stay away from it, it kind of ruins the real fun the story has."
2,In it's original form it's a much better movie.,"Although this movie is quite wonderful in it's original form.The 'Weinstein' version is disjointed, removes any of the undercurrent for the movie, and makes quite a mess of things in the process.Save your money, demand that there be a Region 1 - Unedited/Directors cut, and you'll be much happier."
5,A Good movie,"This is an awesome movie i enjoyed it alot, i think it's a movie for everyone of all ages.If you liked this movie then check out the soundtrack and video game."
4,Very cute! Good for the whole family!,This is a great film and good for the kids. It's fun to see what lies in the grass and underground and to remember we are not the only ones here. I liked it and watched it a few times already with the kids.
4,Son loves it,"My 5 year old son loves this movie. he has watched it a dozen times already. we stumbled across it by accident, I love that I can easily find older movies at Amazon."
4,Nice product!,Purchased to replace the old standard camper shower head. Works just as stated and it's a big improvement over the the standard shower head that has that dial type on/off switch which if you have soapy hands is virtually impossible to turn back on! Definitely would recommend. And the Chrome finish looks great!
1,Pure junk hose,"This was the second of these I purchased. I bought the other one with a new shower head. The showerhead works fine, but the original hose only lasted about 2 weeks before it ruptured internally inside the stainless steel flex cover.The new hose lasted about a month before it blew a hole in what I suspect is very thin-walled surgical rubber hose. It's very flexible, and that's about the only hose I can think of that would stand up to the temperatures. BTW, I have the city water pressure regulated to 35PSI, so it's not being hammered by high pressure.Anyway, both of these hoses have blown holes in themselves. I'm going to replace it with a stiffer, uglier, but more durable reinforced plastic hose.Don't waste your money."
3,worth the money,"This product contains three dinosaur documentaries that are all very good but have nothing in common and only one of the documentaries really talks about dinosaurs being ""perfect predators"". The first of the documentaries is very accurate and clear about its information the the deadliest predators of the Cretaceous Period, the second one is one of the episode from ""Monsters Resurrected"", and the third one is talking about what predatory dinosaurs would win in a fight against T-Rex. Over all I would say that it is worth the money."
4,like it!,"the book is good, brand new. It arrived on-time. it is a helpful book for students who wanna become a teacher of English in the future."
3,Apollonia strikes out on her own!,"A few years after the success of ""Purple Rain"", Apollonia had done some television and film work and was ready to dive back into her music career. Her voice is not fantastic by any means, but like Vanity, Paula Abdul and others, she had sex appeal and star quality. The tracks that make up this ablum are a little uneven, but when they are good, they are very good. The opener, ""Since I Fell For You"", is good fun. Very high energy and easy to sing along and dance to. Another stand out track, and my personal favorite, is ""Am I Growing On U"". I thought it was the most commercial sounding song and was surprised that it was not chosen as a single. The song ""Mismatch"" is simply a rip-off of ""Opposites Attract"" by Paula Abdul. A shameless rip-off at that. There are a couple of pretty bad songs on here, but overall, Apollonia made an impressive solo debut, putting out some fun, very '80s sounding music."
1,APOLLONIA OR SHEILA E???? CONFUSING REVIEW,"Ok, is this an Apollonia solo album or is this Sheila E's third album? The image is clearly Sheila E and the inside pics are of Apollonia whom really didnt go together even if Sheila worked on Apollonia 6's album. This is just very confusing and goes to show whomever posted this on Amazaon doesnt know their Apollonia from their Sheila!"
3,Good deal.....,"Nice deal on the DVD set....although the movies are a bit ""hokey"" is was OK to watch. Nice to get em as a set instead of individually but I only wish they were a flowing story instead of separate movies all by themselves which was what I expected. Overall though it is a nice set."
5,WOW What a Book!!,"Bought this after reading the reviews and man was I grateful I did. This book is awesome and like what everyone else has said, its not for the faint at heart."
5,pure fun,"Like the late great r. Laymon, this was a naughty thrill ride. Not for the easily shocked...it will splatter your punk and leave ya begging for more---------catt dahman"
1,Keynote,Old book-out of date-probably should not be offered for sale. I paid very little so it is ok. I threw it away.
3,Strange Guests,"Fairly interesting book about hauntings, though I have read better. Also, many of these cases I had already read about in other books."
5,One of the best available CDs of Tauber recordings,"It is good to have these 1926 to 1935 recordings of German folksongs in remarkably clear sound. The transfers were made in or before 1994. It would be interesting indeed to hear what even further improvements in sound quality might be achieved using current remastering technologies.Bel Age are to be commended for wisely confining the chosen recordings to a particular song group, instead of grinding out another here and there selection of the type too often found where the compilers cram onto the CD a few examples each from the many musical genres in which Tauber excelled."
3,must be modified,"I found that the product as shipped was not usable. Even with the largest grind available on my solis maesrto, it would not drip down anywhere fast enough. It seemed to stall about 3/4s of the way down. I solved this problem by drilling four more holes adjacent to the one supplied. Now it works fine."
2,Not What You Think,"The photo is deceptive. At first view it appears this is a photo of a cone with an insert that fits into the neck of a coffee carafe. This is not true. The cone sits, rather precariously, on TOP of the neck of a carafe balanced only by the mentioned flange. Somewhat unstable... at least it was cheap!!"
5,Great coffee so easy!,"Can't believe I wasted so much time trying to make my $100+ Cuisinart coffee grinder/maker work without leaking, when I could have been enjoying the ease of this system. Heat the water, pour through into carafe, taaadaaa!! No coffee leaking all over the counter and floor and no more washing all the ""pieces"" of the coffeemaker, plus it's great cup of coffee!"
4,Simple & Effective,"Got this for a boat trip in England. It was easy to pack (along with half a box of #6 filters) and easy to use and made good coffee.Some reviews complained that it ran slowly - we didn't have any trouble with that. The cone we got did have ridges in the bottom to keep the filter from forming a vacuum.The disk at the bottom of the drip cone (which holds it up from the container) is a little less than 3"" across. It's designed for a thermos but we didn't have any trouble balancing it on the edge of a small French press. There's a spout underneath that extends from the disk 1.5"".It takes a little experimentation to decide the amount of grounds and water to put in. We didn't have any trouble making enough coffee for two to three people.Quality was quite good. I don't see any reason to mess around with any other kind of camp coffeemaker in my future!"
2,"OK, but overdone","Parts of this book were great. I liked the unique setup - a young man selling encyclopedias happens upon something dangerous and has to deal with the consequences. It was a quick read but pretty superficial.I felt like two different people were writing. Some of the scenes were interesting and well-drawn. Others were awkward and choppy. I appreciated the ethics of the book as a vegan myself, but the author wasn't very subtle with it, and it was just thrown in with no effort at subtlety. Also the protagonist's romantic interest was a little forced.I would read more by Liss because he has potential, but I would suggest that readers who are interested in his books try a different one than this."
4,a message wrapped in pulp fiction,I am a fan of David Liss and have read a number of his books. The Ethical Assassin is a departure from his other works but was a fun summer read that captured my interest and inspired some thought beyond the humor and the pulp fiction. A comparison with Carl Hiaasen is valid for this read.
2,Not nearly as good,"as his other three. The appeal of this novel relies on a kind of stylized notalgia for the early 80's. But the characters are not likable for the most part. Even the main character has not much depth, and it's a constant irritant throughout that he is narrating parts of the story that he could not know about. The book wants to build the narrrative around the main character's internal reaction to events-- but this guy swings back and forth between extreme terror, and extreme smugness at about 100 mph, it's hard to even keep up with the emotional continuity. However, I did look forward to reading it a bit each night, because the story was engaging and I wanted to know how it camme out. I will certainly continue to buy more from David Liss, based on past performance."
3,The Fourth Procedure,The book wasn't new which was reflected in the price. I was a little disappointed however to find that the spine was broken and some pages just about falling out. Pleased to have it though.
5,The best abortion fiction I've read,I read this book with a little skeptism at first becaue it said it was a feminist view. I was very impressed with how the story laid out. It was kind of weird that those doctors were doing those experiments. A must read for any medical thriller reader.
4,A Stirring Novel,"This novel is exciting and inspiring. I feel it expresses the view of the pro-choice female well and without being too preachy. The story itself is also complex and interesting enough to hold any readers intrest. I especially enjoyed Rachel's speech to the court. I recommend this book to any reader, and look forward to more of Pottinger's work."
3,over-rated,"While the premise of the story setup for a gripping tale, suprisingly little was revealed to the reader beyond the confines of the bathhouse. Nothing about the revolution, the government, the counter-revolutionaries. I also find it annoying the way the author enables her narrator to totally disassociate herself from the pains of the tortures she was going through. She would be eavesdropping to the serenade of the toads or musing over the beautiful stars while being punished at night. At most, she'd say that her face is numbed from the beating. The narrative is very straight forward, the story is mostly driven by its events. There were two glaring misspelling of the word ""waste"" as ""waist"". In conclusion, the book is definitly a page turner but the author failed to go beyond the intiguing setting of the story."
3,Pretty but went back,"These plates have a subtle, pretty pattern, but they went back. Primarily because half of the items in a box were broken during transport. A few of the dinner plates were intact and since they looked big I put them in my dishwasher and realized that if I kept them I would have to wash them by hand since they would not fit in the dishwasher. Also, these dishes were too thich and heavy for my taste."
5,Great watch!,Ordered this Stuhrling watch for my husband for Christmas. Wanted a watch with larger face and hands that were easy to see. This watch is the perfect size and met all the qualifications. He likes the vintage look and is very happy with the watch.
5,Alyce loves the Raggedy Animal Dog Toy,"I purchased (6) Raggedy Animal Dog Toys from Hartz as I couldn't find any at the pet stores and grocery stores any longer. These are more rugged than the ""just"" all soft toys they are trying to sell now. I got my order very quickly and am delighted, as is Alyce!"
3,Confusing,"The problem is trying to fit too much into a confined space. If one hadn't read the book then one would have difficulty with the complexity of the characters & their interactions. Perhaps one expects the impossible. Having read the book I found it fairly easy to follow. Others complained that it seemed disjointed. There is another movie version which has just been showing at cinemas in Australia in which the ball scenes, costumes & jewellery are said to be magnificant but no mention of the characterisation."
3,"A good knife, but depending upon use there is better out there.","If you are looking for a ""camp"" or woodsman style knife, then I strongly suggest you look at the Becker BK-7 or similar instead. The Becker has a thicker more woods friendly blade.If you are looking for a knife to ride your hip while deployed, and to be used never or perhaps once to poke into an enemy soldier's guts, then this Military is likely the better choice."
5,Great utility-fighting knife!,"There is a reason that this knife design has been so popular since WWII - it is an excellently designed multipurpose blade. This version has a black coated, clip point, partially serrated blade that will cut just about anything you could possibly need to cut. The blade comes shaving sharp right out of the box. It's seven inch length provides good reach in hand-to-hand combat, but that length costs you a little bit of control when it comes to dressing game. The knife is well-balanced in the hand, and has a good and solid heft to it. The kraton handle is grippy without being sticky, and has a nice give without being too soft. The steel holds an edge well, and is strong without being brittle At an under fifty dollar price tag, this is a knife that you won't be afraid to use and use hard."
5,Amazing Knife for an amazing price!,this knife comes razor sharp right out of the box. to test it i filled up two 2 liter soda bottles with water. and sliced the tops off both of them without any water from the bottom half spilling out. pretty amazing! its tough looking and feels great in the hand. it is a very durable knife. my best friend has the same one and has never had to sharpen it in about 6 years of use. the blade is incredibly hard and holds a great edge! very satisfied with this knife. the sheath isnt all that great but i bought a Kydex sheath with it. recommended for sure.
4,A well-researched account of another ethnic cleansing,"In this detailed history, Plank describes the British campaign to convert or deport French-speaking Catholics living in Acadia, roughly equivalent to today's Nova Scotia. The deportation was the culmination of a seventy-year effort to transform Acadia into a Protestant, English-speaking area loyal to the British crown. Plank uncovered an impressive array of sources, giving immediacy to some of this history. The Mi'Kmaq Indians, often allied with the Acadians, emerge as a significant third party in this long struggle, in which periods of relative peace and cooperation alternated with military conflict and dictatorial methods. My only criticism is that Plank has a tendency to repeat points in other words. A few pages describing today's Acadian cultural survivals in Canada and Louisiana would have been helpful."
3,Spiders,"Clear illustrations in color; descriptions concise and informative as to habitat, diet and range; however the contents are of exotic spiders mostly from Africa, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia."
1,The Christian Right vs Evolution,"This book basically equates science with naturalism and attempts to subvert good science with bad to support a particular theism, namely Creationism. Non-fundamental Christians and those of other religions which do not equate science with naturalism may find the suggested approach in teaching to be an affront to their religious freedom as well as damaging to a sound science education."
5,Darwin ain't splain nuttin Lucy!,"It is amusing that evolutionists think they have even began to explain anything (or even observed much of ""life"" ), through their atheistic religion. Invariant, spaceless, timeless entities like the laws of logic, which they must use to argue against ID theory, slap them right back in the face!"
5,This book almost destroyed my faith . . .,". . . in the Great Oz Evolution, that is. This book should be required reading for every card-carrying evolutionist. Do you (assuming you are a C.C.E.) still believe that those tired old bromides about the peppered moth, human vestigial organs, Darwin's finches, or the Miller-Urey experiment are the best evidences for evolution? Wells, certainly a card-carrying anti-evolutionist, simply presents the unvarnished history of those (and many other) lines of ""evidence."" Even if you are a believer (in molecules-to-man evolution, that is) you owe it to your own integrity to get the factual low-down these famous evolutionary fables."
1,"Typical tabloid ""science""","What might have been an intriguing work of skepticism is nothing more than an anti-science treatise filled with misconceptions and deliberately misleading quotes. What the book is not filled with is evidence to back any of the author's assertions. I am no scientist; simply a well-read ""layman."" When I read what is sold as a science book, I expect the author to know more than I, and expect the author to provide empirical evidence to support his or her claims. This book is not only bad science; it doesn't even make it as a worthy contribution to religious scholarship. It should be displayed next to the National Enquirer."
1,Wells is a myth,Johathan Wells is the only myth I could find after reading this book. It shows that having a PhD means little when it comes to honesty and knowledge. Evolution is a fact. The evidence is overwhelming. Another fact is don't waste your money or time on this book.
1,"Dishonest, misleading, world would be a better place if it had never existed.","If you are scientifically literate, this book can function as one of ID's playbooks. But for the many people who are not strong in thier scientific background, this book is designed (not so intelligently) to mislead and misinform. True to the cultural movement it represents, this book is breathtakingly inane."
4,More detailed information for deeper understanding,I bought this because it was recommended in more general books on Intelligent Design. It goes into lots of detail about the whys and wherefores of the icons. The overall conclusions are treated in the more general books.
5,Authoritative denunciation of scientific myths of Darwinism,"Will they ban this book in college biology departments? Don't let your kids go to college without reading this book. All those so-called experts who propagate mythology behind the mask of science are finnally being challenged in an authoritative manner by Jonathan Wells (Yale and Univ. California-trained embryologist). As for the comment that the book doesn't create a case FOR creation, only against evolution..... If I lit a candle in my living room 10 years ago, what evidence would there be of that event? You could look for traces of candle wax or soot, but it would be an unlikely search. No one was there when man was created. No one has ALL the answers."
4,Much better than book 1,"This book brought up my opinion of Modesitt a lot. It was much more enjoyable when written in second person and with fewer hard-to-make sound effects. The overall plot of the book was great, introducing the beginnings of Recluce as a Black wizard isle. While the evil characters could really have been developed to a greater extent, and some of the more exciting scenes seemed a little hurried, I truly enjoyed this read and am looking foward to reading the rest of LE's books.P.S. If anyone has a hardback copy of this book, I'd really like to negotiate for it."
3,As good as any in this series.,"The Reculse series is set in fairly standard fatasy world. There are several made up cultures that are interesting enough to write a decent book about, and characters that are a good step above the average. Modessitt writes with a solid stle that holds up well over this meduim size book.In this book, two nobles start a new colony on a remote island off of the main continent, and find that their unlikely love will teach them how to use their magical powers to save themselves.This sterotypical novel will not overwhelm anyone, but will certianly kill a boring afternoon. My main problem with this book and the rest of this series is that all of these books are based on one formula. I have read three or four of these books, and all of them could have been written from the same outline, with just name changes being made...."
4,great deal for Latin Chant fans and singers,"This is probably the best deal available for extensive chant resources, with 4 CDs. I sing chant, but I learn better by hearing than reading music (amateur, I know). It has many Palm Sunday propers and hymns, even some not included on any other chant CD I own. It includes propers for Easter, Palm Sunday, Dedication of a Church, Christmas Matins Responsories, along with one CD each of Old Spanish and Ambrosian Office chant. The download is over $20, but the CDs are under $4, with extensive booklets in multiple languages including Latin and English. A great starting point for singer or fan."
3,Knowledge of Japanese Culture Helpful,"Clearly, some people who have watched this funny movie simply do not and will not get it. It is definitely a culture-bound phenomenon. If you don't understand Japanese culture and Buddhist traditions, it may be obscure and boring. But this movie is satire at some of its most biting--right in the butt of Japanese tradition and religion. It satirizes so many of the institutions that are ""sacred cows"" that to even begin to list them means you're likely not to get it in the first place. Things such as knowing by looking at the sagarifuji crest the sect of Buddhism to which the priests belong, and all that implies. (Contrary to what one other reviewer wrote, as Buddhists we don't provide food or offerings for the afterlife.) Part of the hilarity of the movie is about the ritual impurity imparted by death, part about the role of Buddhism in modern Japan, and a lot about Tradition. An auspicious start to Juzo Izumi's too-brief career."
5,Great CD!,"I first heard Henry on the Bob and Tom show abot 2 months ago. I just got around to buying the CD and wished that I had purchased it sooner. Not only are the songs funny, but they are also pretty catchy. ""She's Talking Again"" is the song I heard that made me want to buy the CD. It is a great song, but I like ""Hit in the Head by a Brick"" better. The only song that is not funny on the CD is ""Jane (Stop this Crazy Thing)."" But it is the last song on the CD (thankfully)."
2,So disappointed,"I'd been so excited to use these, and bought 2. I ran them through the dishwasher first, though, and all the writing is completely gone. My Pyrex glass measuring cups don't lose their writing with hundreds of runs through the dishwasher. Too bad!"
5,Mini Measure Glass Pro,"We use this all the time, then drop it in the dish washer. Works great and the red print hasn't chipped or faded. Highly recommended."
1,Bad Quality ... Just a shot glass after a while,"As mentioned by a few others, the writing on glass washes off and mine was just a quick rinse (not even through a dishwasher)"
3,Was a little disappointed,I was a little disappointed but will read the next three... not sure that I will continue with the series after the third one...
5,Works great!,Kills leaf miners on my honeysuckle and caterpillars on a mountain ash tree. I've used this 2 growing seasons now with the Fertilome Hose End SprayerFertilome Brass Head Professional Hose End Sprayer. Both are highly recommended!
3,PBS commercials are on this DVD,"I did not like the PBS logo displayed in the screen's corner and I did not appreciate the mini commercials for PBS. Those things should not be included in the disk contents since this was a purchase, rather than something from a video rental store. If mini-commercials have to be included, they would be better placed where one has the choice of watching them or not.Some of the disks reminded me of the science movies shown in high school. The photography had an uneven quality about it. David Attenborough collections are much better filmed and narrated."
5,What an Awesome DVD!!,"This DVD is absolutely wonderful,and so very uplifting!! I foundmyself laughing one minute andcrying in another minute. I sovery recommend this to everyone!"
1,Wrong size seatcovers. They assured me they would fit.,I will have to return this product. I was assured it would fit my 60/40 seats on my 1998 Ford Ranger pickup. When they arrived they didn't fit. They should get their products straight. Beware of these.
4,Kids love it! I even found it entertaining,Both the kids and I loved the episodes on this. My only complaint is that it should have more episodes on it than what it does for the money.
1,not one of the best,"This book was not one of the best.I have read every sweet valley kids, twins, unicorns, high, senior year, and university and there was been some bad ones but this one was the worst.The whole book was about nothing, i mean nothing realy happened.You could skip this book and read the one after it and you wouldn't even know the diffrence."
4,"Not the best, but good nonetheless","First off, Timing is Everything is a better album with better songs, secondly I saw these guys at warped tour and they're pretty awesome. It's a little pop-punk but it's good. I say buy this if you're an Over It fan."
3,fairly decent record,"this is probably over it's best cd, and the first song is probably the best on the album. the group are fairly strong rockers, but this record is not going to make anyone's top 10 lists. if you like good charlotte, jimmy eat world, etc., give them a spin. ideally just cherry pick the good songs from itunes and forget the rest."
3,A Good Read,"I originally read this book because of Laurell K. Hamilton...I love her books and felt I couldn't go wrong. Well sadly I didn't like her Anita story featured in this one as much as the full length books and was surprised to say I enjoyed the other writers better (who I had never heard of prior to reading this book). The good thing is though that the book reads pretty quickly. There are four stories included in ""Cravings"" and they are about things such as vampires, werewolves, a bit of magic and sex!"
3,For youngsters,"I liked some of the projects in this book, but I guess I was looking for more advanced projects."
4,A little 80's,"Is it me or do you expect this song in a soundtrack of a movie starring Michael J. Fox, or Corey Haim, or Corey Feldman?"
1,Heather needs a REAL family,"This book is but another of Satan's attacks on the family as ordained by God.The author feeds the readers with the lie that every family is special as long as there is love in it, but those homosexual ""families"" are not families in the first place. She also praises divorcees, like if a broken family was special and good for the children. Stop lying Ms Newman.Satan has deluded millions of people into believing the lie that homosexuality is nothing but an alternative lifestyle and that society can redefine marriage as it pleases, and feed these lies to our children. But this will bring consequences. Remember what happened in the days of Lot."
1,"Now, Parents Who Obey God's Laws Have to Explain Why Some Do Not","How sad that many parents in Heather's Class have now got to explain to their kids why SOME people do not obey God's laws and decide to follow their own laws and how the Bible describes what they are doing was done in the day of Lot and how God destroys them in the end. Too young to have to tell them about Sodom and Gomorrah? Then why are they not too young to be told about homosexuality? Those kids are too young to have to be told about the sins spoken of in this book Don't like what I said, then tell it to God as he wrote about it in his Book, if anyone is interested in reading that book instead of this one. I bet most of the people who read this book have never read the Bible and if they did, they just try to explain away the sin of homosexuality."
2,In search of the real Catherine,I bought this book believing that I would in some way know Catherine more intimately after reading most of her novels. I came away with an understanding of what her life was like and I greatly appreciated that aspect of the book. I was dissapointed in that a lot of it went back and forth between her life and the characters she wrote about. I felt as if I were traveling down a long bumpy road and then backing up at times. It could have been written much better in my opinion.
2,not impressed,i did not like the unusual arrangements inspite of the great singers involved...i wd not recommend it.. i wd not give as a gift.
1,Defective Defective Unhappy,"I could not wait to receive the tables (2ea), so of course I unpacked them soon as i got home today. Well wouldn't you know the first table had two broken legs. I figured well I'm glad I ordered two, but after I opened the box it had two broken legs in the exact same place. Either these tables are just too cheap or came off the production line in 1970. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better product. CHEAP THINGS ARE NOT GOOD AND GOOD THINGS ARE NOT CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bleh,Broke within the first three days >( Would not suggest this product. Go the another way if you want a quality pad for your DDR needs.
5,2.0 is the Best,"This must be the best dance pad ever made, at least for PS2. I have had one for over 5 years, which was previously used by a friend for I don't know how many years. This is an old piece of hardware, and the buttons still function perfectly. The only problem is a tear in the outer case on the down button. Packaging tape makes it serviceable for a while, but inevitably comes undone. Does anyone have a suggestion for patching it?"
1,Don't buy this pad,"I bought this pad and the second day of using it, the back arrow stopped working, we returned it and got another thinking it was just a faulty pad, the second pad's back arrow stopped working after playing it for one hour. I am extremely frustrated after paying $100 for it. You'd think it would live up to the price you have to pay for it. I'm going to try something cheaper."
2,Beware bait & switch!,"We've been using the Ignition 2.0 pads at work for several months now, and they were used by the boss's family before that. The 2.0 pads work very well. However, version 3.0 is horrible, and that is what you will get from GameStop if you order the 2.0 pads. Plus, if you really want the 3.0 pads, don't pay $100 for them when they are available for $80 at the manufacturer's site or other local retailers. They told me today when I called to return them that they no longer carry the 2.0 pads.I purchased four 3.0 pads and returned two of them because the raised arrows slipped to the middle of the pad and could not be adjusted. I realized then that if these two pads were terrible nearly out of the box, I better return the other two before my return period expires. Go with metal."
2,"Awesome, but it broke!","I just got my pad today, and it was the best pad I ever used. I immediately got higher scores than I ever have before. But after about an hour of proper use (in socks, no abuse or anything) the up arrow stopped working. I have had foam pads at a quarter of the price before that may not have been quite as accurate, but at least they lasted a few months. It is not worth the high cost to get a pad where chances are it will stop working soon, if not the same day you get it."
4,I got the wrong dance pad,"I ordered a Red-Octane ignition pad but got a Stay-Cool 8-Arrow pad in the mail. That was strange, but I get to play. I heard that Red-Octane had the best quality, thus the best gameplay. The One I got, is pretty intricate and has yet to fail me. But that fact that I have to take it apart to move it or store it could be an issue. I'm thinking about getting a Naki-Int'l so I'll have both a high quality pad already and another for the go."
5,Better Bed Assist,"Easy to install, fits securely, works very well. My mother-in-law is pleased with it, and the extra bar (which some others don't have) at bed level makes maneuvering in the bed much easier."
5,The best book....even over the Bible.,"Let me start by saying my tastes fall by Navakov, who has a very languid, and trnquil style of writing. I would not even have bought the book, and in fact I did not, a friend bought the book but I asked to borrow it and he said sure, which was nice seeing as he had not read it yet,but I digress.This book is such a great look into the mind of a man who can't surrender the past, that I was stunned. The book was visually stunning and held the attention of the reader the whole time. When I finished the novel, which was the first day i got it) I was left with a feeling of complete Awe. I literally could not speak, my mind just kept turning over the contents in the novel. The book was also funny, I would say it was sort of like a black comedey. Anyways just buy the book, makes a great gift for every single person in your family."
5,If You Like Good Beats...,Hypnotic beats and sounds you lose yourself in. Excellent to listen to at anytime; from alone to in the club. They are unique in their own way and I haven't heard anything quite as good in this particular style.Tui Dub is such a good tune...
4,EXCELLENT SOUND!!!!,"It is a very good mp3player. It has EXCELLENT SOUND , but the instructions were useless. Another flaw was that when u r searching through it, the screen light goes away very fast so u can't exactly read the stuff unless u r always moving the controller. Even if it has that flaw, the radio is excellent."
4,Great Product,"I'm very pleased with this mp3 player, it may nota have a very big storage but it seems to be enough, of course it depends of every person, I think it's better than any other player of 1 Gb, got FM,record from almost any device, uses AA batteries, it's got a great sound.The only con, is that it is not recognized as a removable disk, it needs the driver!."
4,Very solid product,"This is a very solid product, the other reviews are right on the money. But if you want to get this type of device..I suggest actually waiting till the iRiver iFP-900 series is released. It is available in the Nordic countries (nordic.iriver.se) but not yet in the states. I sugguest waiting because the iFP-900 solves the drawbacks of this model the iFP 799.Some of the issues with the iFP 799 that the iFP-900 solves is UMS, data storage (beyond mp3), 266k colour screen."
3,iAudio U2 kicks butt,"The iAudio U2 is the way to go if you want a flash based player. It has all the features of the iRiver and then some, they even look similar. Voice/mic recording, FM tuner/recorder, line in/line out recording, and it acts as an UMS (USB Mass Storage) device (Which means no software is needed to use this). Also, it supports way more codecs and a wider range of bitrates with VBR (ogg vorbis, mp3, wav, flac, asf). The only draw back is that it's battery life is 20 hours as opposed to 40 hours, but then again are you really going to listen to your mp3 player for 40 hours straight?In my opinion the iAudio U2 is the way to go."
5,CAREFUL!,This product is great but don't buy it here! Amazon has the list price as $349.99 when it is actually only $299.99. Shop elsewhere until they fix!
2,I must be the minority...,"First off, Aaron Neville has a beautiful voice, so he gets points for having such a unique voice.However, I found nearly all of this album ""Nature Boy"" to be way too slow. This is almost sleep-inducing music.I've heard a lot of these standards before and they are not usually done this slow. So I would be listening to a familiar song, waiting for it to pick up anytime now, but it never did.+'s Neville's voice, the selection of familiar songs, Roy Hargrove sounds great as a guest on trumpet/flugelhorn-'s The whole pace of the album. Just generally too s-l-o-w.Overall, I'll have to disagree with the majority and say this one's not worth the money."
4,Good Album,This is a great album! It shows Aaron Neville at his best with his ultra unique sound. He makes the jazz standards that he sings magical. He is a great artist. I highly recommend this album. 4 stars.
5,"It's better than watching ""Meet the Feebles"" on 'shrooms!","Brenden Massei is a rare song writer/performer who conveys his message by simple musical arrangements and a direct lyrical style. He uses allegory and metaphor effectively as few singers of any genre do. Comparable to a young Leonard Cohen, Dylan and early Tom Waits, this recording feels like Massei is playing for you in your living room and sleeping on your couch. If ""At Station Four"" doesn't touch your soul, there's no soul there to touch....... BRAVO!"
1,terrible. Not worth the money,"BAD video quality, poor music choice and stupid, silly, irrelevant proverbs. BAD. What a waste of money. Not worth the price."
3,"Fun, but not amazing","I enjoyed this novel for what it was: historical fiction re-imagining Lord Byron to be a vampire. The tale goes through various hallmarks from Lord Byron's life including his relationships with Percy Shelley, John Polidori, and Caroline Lamb. Historical accuracy? Don't count on it, but that's not the purpose of this novel. In short, I wouldn't buy this again, but if you're Byron-obsessed and don't mind a bad book every now and then, go for it!"
4,Modern Translation,"I chose 4 stars because I like reading this translation, it is new & fresh to help us to receive the message of scripture. It stimulates reading a whole book of scripture because it flows so easily."
2,the message,the print is so small you can barely read it. the paper is so thin you have a hard time turning to the page you want.
2,Would Jesus read this?,"This book was very well written- but it did not belong in the Bible section of the book store. Instead it should have been called: The Message- an INTERPRETATION. This was a rather gross interpretation of the teaching of the most famous man in history and the most famous book ever written. It was a very interesting read (if read as an interpretation) for someone who is very secure with what they believe but does not take the place of the original scripture for those seeking truth. I understand that my beliefs are quite different than many others but to take the book that many people base the way they live their lives is a very dangerous game to play. A book worth reading, not a book worth calling a bible."
4,Smaller in Size Than Anticipated,"The Message Bible is really great, however, I was a little disappointed that it was so small. I don't remember when I ordered that it mentioned the size of the Bible and when I received it, I was very surprised with the small size. I could not read the small print without reading glasses (I do not require prescription glasses) and it's still hard to read. I will enjoy the content of The Message, but will have difficulty because it is so small. I caution others who are ordering to make sure that it is not the extra small size that I purchased, unless they are looking for a pocket-size Bible."
5,Excellent purchase,"""The Message"" is written is the language of today. It is easy to read and understand."
5,The Message Bible,"We love this version & appreciate it being offered on Amazon. The ease with which the ordering is made is very nice. But the Bible, give it a try, again, nice version. lThe Message: The Bible In Comtemporary Language, Large Print Numbered Edition"
5,outstanding serivce,sent as a gift. it was received well before the date. service was outstanding.price was significantly lower than at the bookstore. Such a convenient way to send a gift. No trip to the post office.
2,Lesson learned: read the reviews before buying,"I fell into the same trap others have posted; I did not realize the pocket size of this edition, nor did I know the print would be so small and that the verses were not numbered. I am dissapointed and am returning the Bible. No fault of Amazon's, just my lack of investigating what the item actually was. Next time I will be sure to read the reviews.PJA"
5,Fabulous Reading Bible!,"This is a very understandable version of the Bible, in conversational U.S. English. When you read it, you know exactly what the words and context mean.I highly recommend reading this version, maybe comparing the verses to the version you have been accustomed to, and the result will be like hearing the Word expounded upon bya very knowledgeable bible teacher."
1,Bad Bibles - Biblical Error,"The Holy Spirit was not given the glory and honor He diserves in this book.It appears that perhaps the author has not been baptized in the Holy Spirit as yet and come to a knowledge of the truth of the Third Person of the Trinity.The beauty and magesty of the Holy Spiirt is not evident by reading this book.Therefore, if you want the whole truth and nothing but the truth, stick to an accruate ""Translation"" of the bible.Consider well what you put into your spirit."
2,Font size too small!,"I had purchased 12 of these bibles for the children at our church but when they arrived the font size was so small (6pt) it was so hard to read!The kids 4th grade through middle school just wouldn't be able to read it. I will keep looking for the same bible, only in larger font. The bible contents itself has come highly recommended to me from our paster though. I'll find one that works!"
2,Not as stated,This Kindle version was not numbered and it near impossible to get to specific Scriptures unless page through the whole Bible. I love reading the Message but this Kindle version is not what it seemed to be. I do hope they fix the poblem.
2,the leather-like cover flaking,"I bought this in 2008. Love the Message Bible. My complaint is the covering. It is now 2013 and the cover is flaking off and is sticky. If I set anything on top of it, it sticks and pulls the cover off. Otherwise, the Bible itself is fine. This one of those things that only time tells."
3,Difficult to Navigate!,I find this version of The Message quite difficult to navigate. I do love reading this version of the Bible--I just can't easily go to the passages that I may be looking for.
1,A biased and dangerous paraphrase,"The problem with reading a paraphrase of the Bible is that you are getting the views of the one who is doing the paraphrasing on each individual passage, and never the unadulterated biblical text. Readers of The Message should be very aware of the fact that this is nothing less than the views of Eugene H. Peterson passed off as the Holy Scriptures. The most disturbing thing about this paraphrase is that it warps the gospel message into something entirely different. Instead of being declared righteous through simple faith in Jesus Christ for eternal life, through reading The Message one could easily get the idea that salvation is by works or by faith plus works (For a clear treatment of the Gospel and just a great book, see Confident in Christ by Bob Wilkin). Mature students of the Word could use the Message as an interesting commentary alongside the Scriptures, but not by itself. I recommend sticking to a good translation (Like the NKJV)."
5,Great Buy,"This is a great Bible for believers at any stage. It tells the Bible in plain language that makes it easier to understand. I highly recommend it. If you're having a hard time understanding the King James format, this is perfect for you. It also makes it easier to understand for new believers and young believers."
1,The Bible? Absolutely not.,"Is this the Bible? Absolutely not. With a doctorate in language and literature and experience in translation, I can knowledgeably and solemnly say that the many passages I've reviewed are not even close to the original language or original intent. Reader beware!!"
5,Reenergizing the Scripture,"This translation of the scripture breathed new life into familiar passages and brought a fresh joy to reading my Bible. I bought this particular Bible for it's light weight and small size for travel. If you don't need a small, light Bible, I would recommend this same translation in a larger format."
4,Good but not perfect,"I was an exchange student in Colombia and I will always remember a trip we took to Sylvia, a mountain village of Sylvian Indians sharing their crafts. I was very excited about this book and have enjoyed reading it. HOWEVER, I am now working on my first project (mittens) and I have already found an error in the chart. Please be careful. This is not a beginners book. Go over your pattern make sure the math is right. I plan on knitting the llama purse next! It is just too cute for words!"
4,Steiner 8.5x26,Not bad. Works perfect while wearing glasses. Front rubber protector is PIA to put back on. Nothing much else to say.
4,"Alternatives to ""Left Behind"" series","Written by Assemblies of God pastor Dwight Wilson, I first came across ""Armageddon Now"" in the 1980s when some evangelicals were predicting nuclear war with the Soviet Union and the imminent end of the age. Now the Soviet Union is mouldering in the ash heap of history, the predicted nuclear war never came to past, but dispensationalist eschatology continues to march on (thanks in good measure to the sensational success of Tim LaHaye's ""Left Behind"" series which, he fervently believes, is just a fictionalized account of biblical prophecy).But there is a lively debate in evangelical churches about whether this blood-and-gore reading of the Bible is the right one. Wilson's church, the Assemblies of God, officially affirms the style of biblical interpretation that lies behind LaHaye's books, but Wilson asks a lot of thoughtful questions in this easy-to-read introduction to the subject."
2,Very Fragile,"This ring is pretty cool looking, but the problem is that it is fragile. I dropped it in the bathroom after I washed my hands, and it broke into five diffrent pieces. If you insisst on buying this ring I would suggest that you take extra care of it, and be very careful."
5,nice looking accessory,"i thought it was a very nice looking accessory ... can dress it up or down. it was just a smidge small on my size 7 wrist, but still a nice bracelet!"
5,I love it!,"I just love this ring, it's very comfortable and beautiful. I goes with any outfit, it's like a lil black dress for your fingers."
2,Like swiss cheese,"Very disappointed. I also purchased 2 other colors, and those were well-made and gorgeous, but the Bamboo Coral Chip earrings were full of little holes (therefore the swiss cheese comparison) and glaring imperfections. There is no way I'd wear them, so I tossed in the trash. I could have returned them, but they are so cheap that the shipping cost alone would have made the return not worth it. Overall, no big deal. It's a shame since the red color is so pretty."
5,A great concert,I play this for friends and they cannot believe that Hicks has been dead for a decade. This seems fresh and relevant now as ever. There is a longer version of this show but I find this the best. Sometimes editing works to pull things in focus.
4,Monster rancher evo,The game was decent to play -- the hardest part about the game is getting threw the missions and training right. Monsters were not that hard to get but it took time to be able to unlock things. The circus tricks are easy at the beginning but get a lot harder once you have all of the characters and the best equipment. Game was decent but addictive. Recomment for kids
5,enemy and the channel islands,A very revealing story about german occupation in a very fictitious but unusual circumstance . Worth watching.
4,love it - love it - love it,Of all of Roberts' gazillion books this series ranks among my top five favorites. I'm so glad they are finally on Kendle so I can always have them available. These characters are real. The romance is believable. The story is interesting and moves at a good pace. I have re-read this series several times over the years - and it just gets better with each book.
4,Taming natasha,This was my favorite. I loved Spence and Freddie ans I love Natasha family such sweet people. So glad everyone is happy
3,More of an encyclopedia than a textbook,"I actually own the 4th edition of this book rather than the 3rd, but it is probably not too different. This was my first solid state physics textbook, corresponding to a course that I took as a college senior. I did not find this to be a satisfying book to learn from. Concepts, such a band theory, are not well developed. Many steps are skipped in derivations, which left me feeling like I had not achieved a proper understanding. This book does provide a good introduction to the role of the reciprocal lattice in diffraction, though.When I just want to quickly brush up on concepts of which I already have a good grasp, I still turn to this book from time to time. Many of the figures and illustrations are good. One especially useful figure is a periodic table that gives the crystal structure and lattice parameter for each element."
5,The definitive edition,"Originally released by E'G/Polydor Records, reissued in the U.S. by Passport/Jem/Caroline and elsewhere by Virgin. Had three other covers. I had heard half the album already on the 1987 compilation ""King's Road 1973-80"", and a live version of ""Woman"" on ""Arkangel"". I have the Australian LP, but most CD reissues have bonus tracks, and I went to a legal site for the mp3s. You know how it is. The album at first got little notice. A year or two later, Asia came to pass. The rest is history. It wouldn't be until after leaving Asia for good in the early '90s that John Wetton would the full-fledged solo career that once again takes a back seat to Asia."
4,Information-packed,"The dictionary is compact and informative. Although an apter title would be ""Oxford Concise Dictionary of Classical Music"". I cannot find ""punk'"" in it."
3,Just Some Music,"I have an earlier edition of this book, and the edition I have doesn't define many musical terms that I look up, which tend to be terms from folk music. ""Guiro"" isn't in the edition I own. Possibly the book is mis-titled and it should be ""The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Classical Music."""
1,Socks,It would not release the gun easy enough. Also the holster has no tension adjustment screw on it.I have a Fobus for my Ruger P101! works perfect and has a tension screw
3,So covenient!,We usually go to Atlanta to buy these oriental foods but ordering by mail saves time and trouble of driving.Kenzo
4,Good gift..,Was a gift for my Dad...He is in love with the movie (pick of destiny) & loved the gift!Although the picks are fairly thin so I don't think he will be able to use then on his guitar :/
3,They are ok,"I have used these a decent amount of time. I was not pleased about how the black stuff on the pick was fading away. It is a great pick to show off, but ok to use for actually playing."
3,If youre looking for a good replica go no further,"Thes picks of destiny look a lot like the actual pick from the movie, though flat and quite hard to play with if you're looking for a glam pick for a collection pick these up, but if you're looking for functionality you may want to look elsewhere"
5,Title: As good as dead,.I found it very interesting and it keep my attention. I would like to read more of her books
4,As good as dead,This book was extremely good and followed up very well from the other Angel Delaney mysteries. Well worth reading it
5,Great Trucker songs,A good choice for the Truck Driver on the long haul.ItBrought back alot of memories of the old days.Very good listening.
1,"Takara Foot Patch is Stink, Very Sticky and Doesn't Work!","I've tried it and will not every use it again! First of all, it's very very stink! Smells like smoke meat! In addition, it gets very sticky due to the adhesive that you must use. Even after scrubbing my feet the ""glue"" stays on and the smell never goes away, just like being sprayed by a skunk! I've also tested the integrity of the product because you see pictures where at first the patch is clear in the before photo and black/brown in the after photo. Well, actually I had put water on it and guess what, it turned brown. I have discovered that it is the sweat that causes it to change color. The product, like most others, are too good to be true! I suggest that you don't waste your time or money on this horrible product!"
1,Worse than VHS -- green doctors!,"This is all material previously released on other VHS tapes. Most of the DVD is decidedly green-tinted. My VHS of copies of the interviews are clearly better overall in picture quality and color balance. I am an avid collector and this tape is not necessary if you've bought the other tapes, such as Longleat '83 and The Stranger episodes with the Doctors interviews. I don't recommend this DVD for anybody because if you're a fan, you already have the interviews, probably in better quality, and if you're new to DW, you'll be lost, totally lost."
2,Buy the book,"If you bought the book ""Master Cleanser"" don't bother buying the CD. It is a waste of money, as he is not really adding anything new. The book is $5."
2,Who has rooms like this to start with???,"Pretty pictures, but definitely not a practical decorating guide. For the rich and estate-home owning.Who has rooms like this to start with? With high ceilings and lots of square footage and wide natural wood plank! ha ha. Get real. If I had windows and moldings and architectural detail like that, I could make my house beautiful by myself and wouldn't need a book!I was looking for REAL advice and how to bring a comfortable country look to my 1300 sq. ft. 1800's country house with 7 ft. ceilings. What I got was a coffee table book, nothing more."
4,great for early brushers,"I ordered three of these as a way to bridge between and normal toothbrush and a normal powered toothbrush, this one is a disposable battery type brush. Its much quieter, and thus less powerful, that a Braun powered brush and this, and the various styles it comes in, made it tolerable to my child who needs help with brushing his teeth. Note that toothpaste needs to be more or less pressed into the brushes since it will fling it off off it is layered on like a normal brush. We bought the three pack of these and hopefully when they are all worn out we can move up to one with a replaceable head. We have been using it for about two weeks with no sign of slowing down."
4,Not complete without the bitter sweet ending.,"I was one of the original fans of the Beauty and the Beast T.V. show, and it has been entertaining to rewatch the entire series. This last season has its ups and downs, but if you are a fan of the show the final season is a must. However, you should be prepared for a less than happily-ever-after ending."
2,I just don't get it....,"I understand the concept of this music, but the execution is flawed beyond belief. A hybrid of post-rock and free jazz inspired noodling, this album is gleefully all over the place. The vocals are cryptic, mumbled and repetitive. Loops of ambient guitar work and drum flourishes color what feels like a very Chicago art-jazz style beat poetry reading.I think there is an impulse to say that if a record is doing something different, that's enough. But with this record, it just isn't the case. This album doesn't work: it self-destructs, sometimes violently. If you want to hear this sort of thing done right, check out Storm and Stress' ""Under Thunder and Florescent Lights"", a much more thoroughly thought out free jazz/post rock hybrid.Pretentious, over-rated, less fun than ""Portable Model Of"", less beautiful than ""How Memory Works"", this is Joan of Arc's most ambitious album, and also their worst."
3,Just buy A Portable Model of Joan of Arc.,"See the title? That's all you have to know. If you really like that one, then get the others, Live in Chicago! being the last of three to obtain.Go now and buy many CDs."
3,Emo to Techno?,"I love Joan of Arc, but the computer sounds are taking over. When Cap'n Jazz split and Joan of Arc was formed it was like something was lost. The first Joan of Arc album was ok but they have gone downhill from there. But I like them cause its the closest thing to Cap'n Jazz left with the exception of The Promise Ring. In my opinion, you should buy Analphabetapolothology by Cap'n Jazz. Its Joan of Arc's old band and they were much better."
1,save yourself,"As a fan of many years, this endavour of Cris' leaves me cold.This cd unfortunately lacks soul, the poetry of imagination on has come to expect from Cris. It lacks score, scope and heart. And its a sorry thing . . . though it may be due to the relationship detritting."
5,"Again, and Again","These women write music that inspires, amazes, and brightens the world. This is their most unique album of the three I know and it is a fantastic journey of stories, and love, and caring -- about each other, children and the world. From ""Everyone to Me"" which is a love song like no other I've known, to John Deere, a fun song about women and mowing, to ""Choices"" about helping or not helping, the words ring true with meaning, the music is orignal and wonderful, and the journey varies from melody to melody -- ""Radio Quiet"" the title song, is a delightful blend of voices, with words of love and hope and concern."
5,An excellent introduction to Spinoza,"Spinoza is, admittedly, a difficult thinker. And a rare one, too.But, as he himself says, in the closing words of his great ""Ethics"", ""all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare"".Professor Nadler's book is scholarly sober and, at the same time, one feels that he is genuinely passionated for his subject. To anyone interested in learning more about Spinoza and his philosophy, this book is the point where you should begin!"
3,Different from Hardcover!,"Readers beaware! This paperback version of Angelo is VERY different from the hardcover version of Angelo. The illustration sometimes gets cut off i.e. the hat of Angelo is cut off on the cover, the back art is so much smaller as compared to the hardcover version. The layout of the illustration has changed as well, so it reads very oddly as well. The printing quality has suffered so some of the colors didn't turn out as nicely either.Though the story stays the same, there is NO comparison between the paperback and hardcover, if you appreciate what David Macaulay did with the illustration.This goes to the return."
3,"Good for measuring liquids, but tough to clean","I really like being able to pour liquids and measure from the top view. However, when I cleaned the cups with an oxo brush, it scratched the insides of the cup."
3,"Great idea, not too sturdy","I love the angle on this measuring cup! Being over 6ft tall it makes it a whole lot easier to stand and measure rather than hunch over.HOWEVER, the product says it's dishwasher safe and durable but after only 8 months of use and NO dishwasher use, there's a crack in the bottom that seeps out liquids slowly.I am searching for a measuring cup with the same angled design made in another material, one that will last a few years at least! Until then I will replace mine with another OXO because it makes measuring liquids so amazingly simple!"
5,These are awesome !!,"Wow, why this was never thought of before is beyond me, even my husband said, now why didn't I think of that. What a smart idea/design!! They work great! The handle is very comfortable.I bought a set for my sister too, she loves them.I haven't had any problems with cracking.Oh and check out the OXO Good Grips 1061863 Mini Angled Measuring Cup 3-pack, these are so cool!!No complaints here!!"
3,hi,hi i didn;t really like this one that much it was ok the dances were long the music was terrible i'm a 21 yr old and i personally think the music in this one is so bad i have to put it one mute i don't get much of a workout from this one diffenelty not here best tape/dvd
3,decent sex ed video,"This is a decent sex ed video as far as they go. It talks about different, 'advance', posistions and explains their purpose. I liked it."
2,Entretenido pero....,"Cuando lei este libro era el primero que leia de esta autora, y en verdad me parecio entretenido por la manera en que lleva el relato, aun cuando descubri al asesino cuando aun no leia la mitad del libro. Luego de leerlo compre otro libro de ella, lei en total tres de sus novelas, y me di cuenta que explota mucho los mismos temas, y la heroina y el estilo del asesino son en general los mismos en todos ellos."
4,For Dog Lovers,"I like some of his other books better, but this is a cute book for all dog lovers including children."
2,Disappointed,I was sorry I purchased this for my dad. It is off color and inappropriate in our book. I remembered it differently from childhood.
1,Liquidvideo LCD monitor,"It went dead after 3 months, Circuit city wont help.The manufacture keep you on hold for over 45 min and never picks up.I have placed 3 call all over 45 min each."
5,Wonderful wonderfulness,"these guys are frigin good, poppy power chord fun with snappy, catchy lirics and groovy up-beat solos. They just rock. songs about girls and stuff with a dirty slant. cross between queers, groovie ghoulies, and proms."
1,A poor excuse for a tea infuser.,"Don't get suckered in by the low, low price. The mesh size is too large for teas with small particulates (green and otherwise). Plus, the ball doesn't close properly and tea can escape from the hemispherical joint. I threw this away once I saw what it really was."
1,Nothing New Here,"Instead of providing original ideas, the author unfortunately wastes time trying to sound like a cool pseudo-psychologist - a waste of money for us readers. For those with either apartments or houses who are on a budget and want to make their homes more beautiful and comfortable quickly, Lauri Ward's latest book, Home Therapy, is the real deal and the book to read."
5,another stroke of genius,i dont know how Caribou does it but every album released is so perfect. i still cant decide which album is my favorite because they're all so good.this album is different than the other Caribou albums in my opinion. if you're looking for Start Breaking My Heart this isnt what you're looking for.this album is very melodic and has the perfect balance of the classic Caribou sound mixed with a more old school 60's sound. in my opinion this album doesnt have one bad song. they are all very good.the tension and release on Niboe is one of the best things i have ever heard. that song gives me chills everytime i listen to it.all the songs get stuck in my head and i always find myself singing or humming them
2,Not very informational...,"Having been to Maui twice, my husband and I are planning an extended trip to Hawaii next year, this time to take in the other islands as well. We hoped to get a good overview of what to do and see and what to not miss...well, based on the (lack of) helpful info given on Maui, we wonder about what might be missing from the info on the other islands. There has to be a better guide and I guess I will keep looking for it..."
5,My husband and I agree this is a five star rating!,"We enjoyed this DVD showing the Hawaiian islands in two separate episodes. I have been there in the mid 70's but my husband never has and we probably won't get there in the near future. This was the next best thing. Beautiful photography of the landscape and some aerial views, Rudy Maxa has a way of showing the viewer how to slow down and relax while vacationing. This is worth the price in our books. Enjoy!"
4,An Effective Source of American History,"This was the primary textbook for my A.P. United States History class. It gives excellent information about the history of our nation, bringing it to life and portraying it as more than just facts. Garraty does a wonderful job of bringing important historical figures to life. However, it is not an appropriate source for information on world events. Major conflicts such as the World Wars are explained from an American persepective and only cover how America was involved and how it affectd us. It is evident that Garraty did lots of research for this book. I enjoyed it very much."
4,A superlative account of our history.,"Like many of the other reviewers of this text, I too used Garraty's book in my AP US History course, but unlike some, I felt this book served more than its purpose. It not only presented the how, when and what, but the why; possibly the most important of the questions a text answers, or attempts to. However, that should be expected in any text, what this book offered was a more personal account based on narrative instead of rhetoric. It proved as interesting as it did informative, as only Garraty can."
2,2nd parts are never better than 1st part,"I own a copy of the first edition of this book, byP.Kundu (himself, alone), and find it very usefull,and generally very well and carefully written.Unfortunatelly I can't say the same about this2nd edition. Just for one example, turn to pagenumber 124, example 13.The answer is incomplete, to say the least.In fact is wrong. The answer should be+/- k.G with k the number of times the curvegoes around the point, and the sign dependingon the orientation of the curve.I simple, but misleading, mistake."
5,My favorite grad fluids book,"Kundu is my new favorite graduate level fluids text. It is every bit as rigorous as Panton, but Kundu takes a step back to revisit some of the mathematics. He even goes so far as to remind the reader at one point that i = sqrt(-1). I would have appreciated this as a grad student myself.The section on waves, the wave equation and simplifications to analyze gravity is excellent. It shows his background in Oceanography. His section on potential flow really makes the correlation between the mathematics and the physical intuition necessary to make sense of the mathematics.Overall, I find it to be a rigorous yet readable text."
3,Ok song,"This is a decent song, considering it's on a South Park soundtrack. It's worth a listen or two."
1,THIS SUCKS,"Master P has creater THE worst song I have ever heard in my life. It sounds like he recorded the ""Kenny died tonight"" part with that annoying scream in the background once and then just looped it for however long this disaster, inappropriately called a song, goes on for.This is one of the only actually annoying songs Ive heard, I cant stand listening to it. The only reason I think this could have been a ""hit"" apart from it being played on trend TV MTV every five minutes is that Kenny's in it.If you have an IQ greater than a small paperclip's, you will stay far away."
5,Amazed and Graced by the real Sacred Songs indeed,A beautiful record that got no press but should have. But it isn't too late to get your hot little hands on a copy. You won't regret it.
3,A gift,"It's just a book,but it's the bills so my husband likes it.Was a gift for him.Was used in good condition.Would recommend"
1,should be called how to be a power ranger,this is a piece of junk. dont waste your time or money on this worthless excuse of a book. the pictures of the wannabe power ranger should speak volumes alone for how bad this book is. if you are still unconvinced look at the diagrams done in western form instead of traditional asian style. the dumbest thing in this book has to be where it talks about driving the cartilage of the nose thru the brain causing death. when any person who knows anything about martial arts knows that is impossible to do that. what actually kills the person from that type of blow to the head is the impact causing the brain to slam back and forth in the skull which is what actually causes death. dont waste your time on this book it must have been written by some one who learned their martial arts from watching the power rangers.
1,Serious Martial Artists- Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!! Bullshido.,"I've just bought this book, opened it to find photos of ninjas and Western style medical diagrams... So I went online to do some research on hei long (the author) and his mysterious martial art ""lian shi""... there is literally nothing on the internet about this art, his own website has no instructor called ""hei long"". furthermore I found that there is a wikipedia article on Hong Kong comics - with a character called ""shi hei long"" ---notice the resemblance to the authors name and the art.[...]DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,The Perfect Gift,"I purchased this book to give as a gift to a new friend who has lived by the ocean all of her adult life. She has several boxes of shells and was bemoaning the fact that she needed to do something with them, but didn't know what to do. This book has given her many ideas, some of which she has started to use. Besides having wonderful pictures to browse through, the book is a very informative, interesting read. My friend was thrilled with my choice. Carol"
2,Broke within the first two months,"I don't have much luck with pepper mills/grinders, it seems. I read the reviews for this and thought that it would be much handier than the wooden mills and liked the idea of the catch container below the grinding element. Used it off and on since I got it in late June and last night it jammed and broke when I was cranking out a teaspoon. Plastic has its limits, and now will order a metal mill."
1,Dave,Worst holster ever purchased. Did not fit my wifes S&W bodyguard 38 sp. was so loose it would fall out.
1,Retention is too 'good',"I tried with this thing for at least an hour before taking advantage of the Amazon return policy. If my 357 magnum S&W 649 is just loosely placed in the holster, it will come out nicely. If, however it is placed in all the way until it 'clicks' in, then it is a bear to get out. More likely to pull entire rig off your pants than it is to withdraw. I know there is supposed to be a 'trick' to it, but after an hour, I think it is just a poor design."
2,Old London Melba,"The item that was shown was not what I received, I have been looking for the garlic melba, not roasted garlic, which is what I received.. There was nothing wrong with the product, not what I wanted though....there was a mixup on the website which has since been corrected.Amazon was great to deal with through the whole process.!!!!"
5,YankeesGrammySays,"Delighted with the service! The DVD set arrived so quickly that I checked my invoice to make sure that I had not orderd speedier-than-regular delivery. I wish EVERYTHING could be obtained without a third-party supplier. Great work, Amazon!"
5,Jag Season 8,"This season had a lot of events in it. Finally we get to find out what happened to Bud after the land mine accident, NCIS is introduced with its original characters as Harm is accused of murder, and when Harm finally decides upon his feeling for Sarah, he may have waited too long and is replaced by another to which she feels obligated."
1,limited application,"This book does not clearly state the subject matter in the title. If you are only interested in identifying the manufacturer, this is the book. For those like me who were looking for a true ""Component Identifier"" this book fails. Determining, for example, the type of capacitor you are holding in your hand and reading the value as stamped on it, would more clearly describe a ""Component Identifier""."
4,"Very in-depth, very scholarly","If you're looking for a highly readable book, this may not be the one for you. But if you want a dense, scholarly account of the world of the Gypsies, this is it. A fascinating look inside a world very few outsiders are privy to."
5,I've Tried Two of These Teas,"A few months ago at PDX airport I found these teas. They turned out to be very good teas.I bought Indian Love Tea, and Good Medicine. They are both great."
2,"These teas are good, but...",The price here is too high! I bought this same amount of these exact teas for $10.99. Amazon is turning into a Grand Wayne Ripoff Central!
4,Spinning Change is the Only EN Constant,"My first impression is this album brings the listener down, paused and pondering. It harks back to Ende Neu, in that it demands repeated listening - quite unlike the excitement and adrenaline of hearing Silence is Sexy for the first time. The experience of hearing these new pieces (which are now quite literary) in a smoothed out, straight forward album sequence feels more broad in its reach than any of their previous achievements. Weird for EN's ability to focus. Lots of air compressors at this point.I'm still convinced in the integrity of EN. They remain a great musical muscle. What's to come?"
5,you won't regret silence is sexy!,"""silence is sexy"", EN's previous effort, is easily one of my favourite albums of all time and the benchmark for any future EN release. So, how does this latest work stand in comparison with it? well, it's ALMOST as good and nothing short of brilliant. ""Ich gehe jetzt"", the killer opening track, is astounding, dark and foreboding. But I won't comment on every single track, let it suffice to say that this is top-notch material...The tone of the album is calm, subdued (think ""silence is sexy""), sometimes spaced with sudden burst of fury (again, think the previous album)."
2,"""Perpetuum Mobile"" a slight disappointment.","There are many great reviews of this album, but I must say I was slightly disappointed by this latest release. It is supposed to be somewhat of a second half of ""Silence Is Sexy,"" (all of Neubauten's albums follow a definite theme) but it certainly lacks the intense emotional depth and drive that E.N. is famous for. ""Perpetuum Mobile"" feels vaguely superficial, detatched, and even pretentious at times (especially the lyrics, which are mostly in German). Blixa's high pitched screech is over-utilized. There are some high points however, and the instrumentals are amazing as always. If you are a first time listener, I highly recommend ""Silence Is Sexy,"" or their ""Strategies Against Architecture"" series over this album."
1,inhuman,"It is a close call - which stands more as a testament to the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of Western Civilization - EN, or the fact that they have fans? One can't say. Probably, the best answer is that either one is sufficient to reach the conclusion. Together, the band, the ""music"", and the fans, are a wholesale condemnation of all that matters.You want to sit around and stew in your vacuity? You want to convince yourself that you're nothing more than a bag of stinking pus? That faith, reason, and all human effort are illusory and for naught? This is the band for you. Enjoy."
4,Easy to use,"I loved this high chair so much that I bought two. I had bought one for my in-laws house and thought it was so easy to use that I had to have one for my house too! The tray was so easy to put on! All you have to do it set it on top of the arm rests and push.. It clicks itself on. There are two ways to unlatch the tray. You can use one had (in the front) or two hands (on the side). The chair is also very light, which I also love. I only rated it a 4 and not a 5 because, my son, who is 8 months had figured out how to take the tray off all by hiself. Not so wonderful. I know understand why it was so cheap. I had bought a really expensive one and once I realized the cost wasn't everything, I sent it to my mothers.. I might have to change back (I will see) This one is much easier to use!"
3,Cows on Paperade?? I'll take that!,Great book to remember the fascinating summer those beautiful bovines gave us. For those of us who aren't able to afford to buy one. This is a great book--kinda like a yearbook in high school to look back on!! I can proudly say that Chicago rules!!!! Those cows started here and will come back to stay!
4,otherwordly erotica,"Beauty is an entertaining look into the mind of a submissive, allbeit a fantastic one. By the second book, some of the punishments and activities seem to have been devised just to shock and have little basis in anything remotely reasonable or believable. If you are looking for straight fantasy erotica, these are great and fun to read. But not for someone looking for something a bit more realistic."
1,No Way!!!Don't waste the money,"I bought these because of all the great reviews here. Now I am open minded but this stuff was not sensual more like hard core and kinky freaky deaky. I couldn't even get into it because it was so unpersuasive, this wasn't fantasy this was freaky. I sent them back. And there were way more guys with guys then girls with girls. This book might be better for the person who is thrilled by a dominatrix type. Not for me."
2,For Free Spirits Only,"While Anne Rice's other novels are extremely well written, I cannot say that this series is as articulate. At first I was really disappointed with them, but by the second book, I was asking my boyfriend to bend me over his knee and spank me too. These books opened up a new sexual fantasy realm for me, and I'll admit, I'm not sure I'll ever be satisfied normally again. By the end of the trilogy, I was pretty upset to know that I'll probably never get to experience the slave/master relationship, or such free sexuality like Beauty does in the novels. Changed me forever."
5,Loved it!,"I was instantly hooked. The Beauty nolves are the most enchanted adventure into phyical self exploration. After reading it, I felt like a dominatrix. Now i truly know what submission is."
5,Anne Rice... I think I love you?,"By FAR my fav series EVER!Now if you can handle the heat, stay AWAY from this book but personally I thought it was flawless.Ever since I read it I can't find another book like it so if you know any let me know =]"
2,Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,This book is just nasty with no plot. I knew it would be erotic like the 50 Shades series but there was nothing about it that was worth reading. Trash for sure.
3,a surprise,"An ok read, a little more ""out there"" than I expected. The series is addictive, I read all three books."
2,Be surprised,"it is filled with not just regular sex , but a lot of male on male. Was not expecting that."
2,It was okay,"This book was ok, but not anything to write home about. I have no qualms with the writing, it was the fantastic writing I've come to expect of Anne Rice, rather it was the way the subject matter was presented. This is the book that makes people believe that Dominant/submissive relationships are abusive, when in fact they are not.If you're someome looking for a book about very taboo erotica this is the book for you. For everyone else: Try if you want, but you won't miss anything if you don't."
2,nothing like 50shades,"After enjoying read 50shades I seen that Sleeping Beauty was compairable. Its not. Its pretty cheesy, & tacky to say the least. I hope it gets better if I can bring myself to keep reading it."
1,all i can say is gross!!!,i read this book because i heard if you liked 50 shaded of grey you would like this trilogy...well i hated the books!!! they were so bad that i dident even finish the second book or read the third one. they were just sick and wrong on so meany leavels !!! i just cant belive anyone would like these books....they were just bad bad bad!!!!
3,"Erotic novels about ""sleeping beauty"" in medieval times. Fair read, but you gotta like sex!","VERY, very graphic erotic novel... You must enjoy sexually explicit novels or you will not be a fan of this series. If you are, it is an intriging story tale."
1,Not What I Expected....,"When I saw this series at the bookstore, I rushed to buy it, as I am a huge fan of Anne Rice. But, instead of a well-woven story with lovable characters, I found myself digusted at the book and the characters. Although I love Rice this is one series that I could not finish reading, and that is saying a lot since I have finished all of her other novels. Yes, it does pertain a lot to erotica, but maybe if it was done with likable characters and a better plot I could have enjoyed the series more."
2,what went wrong?,"I was disappointed. Granted, as I am both an Anne Rice and BDSM enthusiast, I had *high* expectations. This arc began with great promise, and the beginning of The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty awoke a definite sense of eroticism, that dark sensuality ... [and then] this degenerated into a marathon of spankings and punishments so hardcore it gets ridiculous. This stuff doesn't turn you on, it makes you roll your eyes. ... The tender, erotic aspects of a dominatrix/slave relationship were tossed aside for pages of being spanked on the buttocks and men having phallic shaped objects shoved into them."
1,awful,Not like 50 Shades at all. Wish I did not buy these books. YUCK.....yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck
2,Trash .,"This is one of the most boring,poorly written series of books that I have had the misfortune to buy. I was so bored that I did not finish book 1 in the series and have no wish to attempt reading the others. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Anne Rice shines in a non-vampire book,"When I heard about this series I wasn't sure what to think. After started to read it, though, I got hooked. I read all three in a matter of days.If you look deep into the development of the characters you can see how much Anne Rice is able to enrich her books with vivid passionate details of everyone. She's able to look into the hearts and minds of her readers and make you feel like you are inside the story.She's able to make it seem that you are the one who is being oppressed. She makes you feel like you are the one who is being subjected.Anne Rice has long been one of my favorite authors, and these books are certainly no exception."
4,The Claiming Of Sleeping Beauty,I found this book to be erotic and breathtaking. In the beginning the way Sleeping Beauty was treated made me angry and upset. As the book unfolded I could not put it down for one moment. It is the kind of book that gets all of your motions wrapped up in it!
2,"So many pages, so few information","Very superficial information, not useful for serious reading or research. It almost seems like the author spent more time finding out 101 things to write about just to justify the title, rather than concentrating on in-depth analysis of noteworthy curious."
3,A Meek Trivia Book,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. The book will really only appeals to the most extreme Disney fan. However even then those people will probably already know these stories.The book is 101 stories about trivia book about different things in the Disney parks. Some of the stories are very interesting. Some of those stories is the stuff you have already heard before. What would really make this book better is photographs. If a reader isn't familiar with the parks they will be lost. The photographs really would enhance the book. The stories do enhance things to a small degree. Most of the stories are the small facts about the little things like the truck driver on test track in Epcot is President LBJ. Walt Disney put little thank yous across the parks to commemorate people who helped him, front companies he used, and of course to honor the mouse.The book isn't very big. It is like an hour or two read. So you don't have to worry about wasting a lot of time."
3,"Not extremely detailed, but fun anyway","This book was fun and insightful but not extremely detailed. I read other books (""The Magic of Walt Disney World"") that deal with the same things in greater detail and more like Walt would have written them--like the story they are."
2,Not for the Disney Buff!,"If you know nothing about Disney World, this might be somewhat interesting, but if you're looking for significant insights, this isn't the book for you. As many other reviewers have stated, there is no real substance to the information. You're given little tidbits of information, but none of it is expanded upon. So many of the 101 facts are really basic. If you've read any book about Disney World, you probably know these things already. It's almost as though this book is a compilation of facts from other books on the subject. While it wasn't a total waste of money, it's not something I'll keep to page through again. ""Mousejunkies"" is a far better publication and costs about the same."
1,"same old same old meditation, deep breathing and cbt","So I sprang for this book and cds The Linden Method because I am sick of going to doctors and thinking I am dying of a heart attack at any moment. I also now have rapid heartbeats and sweating attacks which to me sound like panic attacks. Here is the bad news his book reads like a snake oil salesman. It is largely about him and his illness and recovery. He hates valium. He feels you can change your thinking and all will be well. The nine pillars are a combination of CBT, meditation and yoga. NOne of these are harmful in fact they do work. It is silly and nonproductive to think that you can control your anxiety by ignoring it and doing other things. It is the same thing all of us have heard a million times. Save your money and try free meditation and deep breathing excercises, just my opinion."
1,Will not play in Region A...,"I purchased this movie after a long search for a compatable region. Upon receipt, I attempted to run the Blu-Ray movie but the blu-ray player identified it as having ""the wrong format"". I then called Panasonic, who walked me through the firmware update and said that the player was designed to play in region A or A/B/C and that it should now work if the movie is as advertised. It didn't. Another movie I just purchased this week having been released last week, plays just fine. Panasonic said it was the disc that was faulty or the format was not as advertised. I will just have to wait until the US decides at some point to release Miss Potter for a local audience. I have returned the item for a full refund as ""not as advertised""."
5,Just Beautiful,"I fell in love with Norman at precisely the moment Beatrix fell in love with him, when they were dancing and he was singing. If I thought the CD of the soundtrack of this film included Ewan McGregor singing (for just a few minutes) ""Let Me Teach You How To Dance"" I would buy it in a heartbeat. And a reminder, if you are prone to skip the credits at the end of films -- don't do it here. The song ""When I Taught You How To Dance"" that plays at the end of the credits is enchanting."
1,Let down once again....,"I was so excited when I saw this DVD. Finally, I thought, a movie about Harry Potter's obscure aunt. It's about time they shine the spotlight on her and give Harry a break. I popped up some popcorn, popped the DVD into my bigscreen and prepared to be blown away. About half way through I was very worried by the lack of ""magical hyjinx."" There was no broom riding, magic frog potions, dragons, nothing. Just a few rabbits- and no, they weren't even being pulled out of hats. It turns out Harry was the only one in the family with magic powers after all. I still couldn't turn it off though, the chance that she may pull out a wand and turn a pumpkin into a coach kept my eyes glued to the screen. I was so disappointed when it was over I pulled out my candles, drew a pentagram, and did some magic of my own! So don't be surprised if we are introduced to a bald Renee Zellweger very soon!"
5,The wife loves this movie,"Not true to life, this movie weaves several beautiful loves of a confident woman comfortable with herself. Good at heart , honest even in the exploration of emotions new to her."
4,Pleasant surprise,"I was on a flight from Hawaii to LA and ""Miss Potter"" was the movie that was shown. I had never heard of it, so I was amazed to see actors of such high calibre (Renee Zellweger & Ewan McGregor) starring in the movie. I wasn't expecting much, but I decided to watch it because hey, I was trapped on the plane. What a delightful surprise ""Miss Potter"" turned out to be! I had no idea that Beatrix Potter was so cool. Her story is that of an independent woman who believes in her creative talent so much that she goes against social convention (and her mother!) to pursue her dream of being published. All of the actors are wonderful, especially Emily Watson as her staunch friend and ally. I was also surprised to learn of Beatrix Potter's legacy to England. I subtracted one star because the first half of the movie is treacly sweet, but overall this is a great story and a little gem of a movie!"
2,Wonderful Movie--Would not play on my Blu-ray,"Miss Potter is a wonderful, sensitive, and well-acted film. I have a regular DVD copy of it which, I suppose, will have to suffice, because my Blu-ray copy will not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. I even updated the firmware as suggested, but it did not help. I wish Amazon would post a disclaimer to this fact so that others will be spared the inconvenience of having to return unplayable copies. I have purchased many Blu-ray discs over the past six months, and this is the first one that I've had a problem with. The production of the disc appears to have been done in Australia which may--or may not--have something to do with the incompatibility. So, as the previous reviewer stated, BEWARE!"
5,Love this movie,"I first rented this movie from the library, but liked it so much that I wanted to have it in our family's collection of DVDs. The price was great through Amazon. It is well done and a good family movie that has no swearing, nudity, etc. I have always loved the Beatrix Potter books so it was nice to watch the movie about her life."
5,"How to get well and stay that way (natural remedies, diet)","Dear Amazon, Today (14 June 96) I will send you a review of Returnto the Joy of Health by Dr. Bob Sager; the review was emailed to me by Dr. Rona who informs me that the review is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN. Cordially, Brent Rooney (whatsup@vcn.bc.ca)"
1,This book is A bomb,"When I buy a joke book, I want the jokes to be funny and these ones are. So this is a good joke book. But there's a point in a joke sometimes (and if you've ever seen a Jim Carrey movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) when you realize that the clown suddenly wants to be taken seriously, that he has a ""serious message"" and a heart dripping treacle. I find this disgusting. Very displeasing to both the eyes and the nose. It makes me want to take a shower. If Gudding wants to make jokes--fine, he's good at it. His poems are wonderfully naughty bathroom-stall graffiti. When he (or worse, readers) start to make claims for their importance as either thinking or art, then the joke's on them but nobody's laughing anymore. At this point I am tremendously bored by both these poems and their dorky Star-Trek grad school apologists. The indignant comparisons of academic credentials by previous posters--now that's funny."
4,Up on the Lowdown and Up,"Ms. Price strikes again. I'm behind the curve on listening to her which is my bad. Not a bad song on this album. ""Foolin' Around"" is down right shiver in your bones sexy and her cover of the Gwil Owen's song ""Lonesome Wind"" is a classic."
4,Not Bad,"The cover is slightly misleading. The host doesn't ""hook up"", but she does flash. I guess it's something.This is a fairly good pick for about $13. It's like a ""Blind Date"" episode, except they get the participants in the buff during the interview segment. The first date is with two girls. It was fairly good, but there weren't any explicit shots. I would compare it with a Cinemax late-night feature. The second date is with a guy and girl. It's the same deal here. The last part of the video is this guy trying to pick up on the host. She detests him but tries to be polite and let him down easy. I was laughing out loud because he gets her to flash him. Fantastic! Most of the girls are fake looking, which is something I don't normally like, but it wasn't too bad. They still looked good in spite of this."
4,front springs,pro- great productcon- I was expecting red springs as indicated in pictureI recieved a black springs - but thats ok .
2,This stuff smells awful!,"The day cream is amazing. This night cream however smells just awful. It could be the best stuff ever, but I'll never know... can't get over the stink."
3,Would be a better book but for the repetition,"I'm thrilled that this book exists, but it's a lot like one of those jazz box sets that incorporate the complete recording sessions for an album - it's interesting to follow the evolution of a song in the studio, but all of them? In a row? It takes some serious OCD to listen to that, and it does here as well. In addition, this has the issue that trying to transcribe a spoken word performance to paper is like reading sheet music. Lots of subtleties are lost. That said, if one reads the non-transcript portions of this are fascinating and teach you something about just how brilliant Hicks was that even reading his excellent biography didn't even do for me. This was a man who thought long and hard about serious issues and turned them into something to laugh about. No easy feat. Get the book, skip the transcripts and pick up his albums instead."
2,Ruined by very poor source materials,"This is a great collection, I find trailers like these hilarious, the outrageous headlines, the over the top commentaries just crack me up. The only problem with this collection is that they've been sourced from very poor material, no effort at all has been made in restoring them. I've seen some of these in a lot better condition on other DVDs. If some sort of restoration effort had of been made I would rate this 5 stars, until then it only gets 2. I hope next time they release a collection that concentrates on 1950's and 1960's B-grade science fiction trailers with an effort made in restoring them."
4,"Deeply dark and very, sexily, Nephilim.",Preacher man! That's all I really need to say. The Nephilim is embodied in that song.
4,military style shorts,"I'm very pleased with the product, with the only exception being the cost of shipping, I think is too high. But other than that everything is ok."
3,"Loved the idea, hated the ending.","I love the whole premise of the book, and the author makes a good initial start. He gives us some interesting characters, and a good bit of intrigue, then drops the ball.I still enjoy re-reading the book, but I have to stop before the ""hail mary"" ending. The first time I read it, I got to the end, and was EXTREMELY disappointed."
2,Fascinating Idea Falls Short,"I thought that Shadows Fall was extremely entertaining up to the halfway mark. Strangely enough, once the action started to pick up a bit I became more and more disenchanted. For one thing, there are far too many subplots woven together to keep the work as a whole cohesive. Shadows Fall has interesting characters (including a thinly disguised rock star who is no longer with us), a creative setting, and an impressive premise. It also has a very disappointing conclusion. Maybe this one book could have been divided into a trilogy or series with each subplot given the attention it deserved."
1,English custard Delicious !!!,Glad I found this product on line. Used regularly in UK. It is delicious poured over Apple Pie or in trifles.
4,Great Portrayal of an African American Family!,This was my favorite season of Soul Food. It is realistic and I absolutely love the chemistry between Boris and Nicole!
5,Soulfood - The Third Season,"I realize I am a few years late, but back then and now I do not have cable. I love this series. I am at the end of the third season and will be purchasing season 4 at the end of this week. I have fallen in love with this family, and am sad to see my realtionship with them (friends in my head) come to an end. I wish there were more seasons because one by one I'd buy them all. We need more shows like this one. This show made me change a few things in my life. They make me want to do better. To the writers and producers of this outstanding series, I Thak You!"
5,loved it!,It's quite small that fits very well with my palm. yet it's powerful and tackled most light to medium jobs with no problem at all. absolutely can't go wrong with it!
5,I have only owned it for 3 days but so far it is the best drill I have ever owned.,"I have only owned it for 3 days but so far it is the best drill I have ever owned. The drill is very well balanced, charges very quickly in around 30 minutes. It also comes with a nice case and two batteries which makes it very handy as a full day drill. Contrary to some of the other reviews it is really easy to replace the drill bits and you can do it with one hand. I particularly have found the adjustable clutch useful and has prevented me from stripping out screws like I used to with my old drill. This drill has just replaced my other lithium ion cordless drill and probably my corded drill as well. A+ Bosch."
4,Very nice tool,"This is a tool that I should have purchased a while back. It replaces most of my screwdrivers. The LIon batteries are great because they keep the charge until they are almost out and with the 30 minute charge you get back to work quickly. When you are in tight spaces,trying to find a way to turn a screwdriver, this is just what you need. It has surprising torque. Two thumbs up."
3,Unworthy of a Writer as good as Le Guin,"I'd like to preface this by saying I love U.K. Le Guin. She is one of my favorite authors; I have read at least a dozen of her works and enjoyed them all, except this one.Trading Planes is not a novel. It is a series of stories in which Le Guin describes new civilizations she created. One gets the feeling that she may have gone through her writing journal and found a bunch of ideas for societies she had hoped to one day create and expand upon, but hadn't got around to it yet. She then turned each into a short story... but for the most part they are not really stories. Just a description of a society from an almost anthropological perspective. Their are no real characters to follow, almost no dialogue, and certainly no plot.It was a tedious read which I endured only out of love for the author..."
1,Rehashed Material,"Beacham's first book was okay--The Roman Theater and its Audience. But this book seems largely a rehash of it. There's changes in focus of course. Nothing really original though. For a really GREAT, well-researched book on Roman theater, search for the title ""Roman Theater and Society."" It's still in print, and available here through Amazon."
1,Save your money,"This product did not work. Not even a little, I followed the directions as I was suppposed to and it didn't make a difference. Save your money or spend it on something else."
2,disappointment,"I thought I was getting a cd full of exciting games. I found it mediocre since, you only have three bonus round games and the rest of the slot games are very much the same. Very dull, but just a little better than Monopoly Vegas Edtion, that one is a no-no for those of us who like to play slots."
5,no better writer,"I have started reading the seven wonderful Inspector Barnaby mysteries written by Caroline Graham for the third time and have to admit, for me, there is no better mystery writer in the English language. Intelligent, hilarious, fresh, and literary are some the adjectives that come to mind. Those of you who have only seen the televised series are in for a delightful surprise, for the books are far superior; indeed, it beggars the imagination the see them as anything but distantly related to the television presentations. My only regret is that Graham hasn't brought out a new mystery for quite a while, but, until then, I'll enjoy re-reading the ones I have.Murder, That's What"
1,Unethical Conduct Promoted,"After reviewing this book, I found this book offeres little value to the understanding of our cultural heritage. The author is simply promoting treasure hunting, that leds to the destruction of the world heritage.If I am a bookstore owner, I reconsider carrying this book in stock."
4,Explore 'n Play Center,"This was received as a gift for our son on Christmas. He loves it, however I think he has outgrown playing with it now at the age of 13 months."
5,Tracy from Dayton Ohio,"Its an Awesome movie characters are wonderfully drawn, I seen this at the movie theater and said I had to get it. Blu-Ray and in 3-D awesome!!! I got it as a present the day it came out =D"
1,Does Not Play on All Blu-ray Players,"I purchased this product to watch on Halloween and was very disappointed when (after watching preview stuff) nothing happened after clicking ""Play Movie"". I assumed the disk was damaged and returned it to exchange for another one. The same thing happened with the new disk. There was a message somewhere on the disk stating that it may not play on all blu-ray players. I have a Samsung Full HD 1080p player about 18 months old. I'm not about to buy a new Blu-ray player every year or so to keep up with new technology! If your player is able to view this movie, however, I found it very creative and interesting (I watched it on pay-per-view)."
2,Evil Slant A Bit Much for Children,"It pulls one in out of curiosity, but then it takes an ugly twist which is too hard for adults to understand, let alone children. I would say it has been influenced by bad, negative forces we can't see - demonic."
5,i dont care what anyone say this movie was phonemonal,the art keeps you awake and alive and all the characters deliver some humor and edge
4,Coraline (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy w/ 3D) [Blu-ray] review,Make sure you read the conditions of sale. It's a bit of a rip off if you don't live in the USA or Canada -- for some reason you don't get the digital copy.
5,Crap! This movies good.,Coraline is a awesome book and don't let anybody tell you it's not. Even if you don't like it you probley do you're just pressered by peers or something. First i would like to say that is a little weird and out there but when people go as far as to say that every kid will be scared and have nightmares thats just plain sterotyping(get the pun its sterotyping and i am typing this ha ha ha!!!)Well as i was saying it is perfect! The mom is really so evil but is so good at being nice to coraline in the beggining and then she turns into a giant praying mantis( i never saw that coming but i saw it in the previews!!!) i defintly think that every one across the nation should have coraline in their homes!!!
2,If you're hard up for 3D,"There is so little to choose from in 3D that I doubt I'm alone.. I've bought almost everything there is to buy on 3D. Unless you're bonkers over Tim Burton, I recommend skipping this one. Sure the 3D is awesome but everything else is forgettable. 3D for the sake of 3D."
4,Good 3d movie,"Pleasantly surprised that this 3d dvd also came with a regular dvd and digital copy. Digital copy expired 1/20/12, but was able to download just in time. Great 3d movie and I liked the darker aspects of this. Could be a little scary for small kids, but fun to watch."
5,Loved It!!!,I love that this movie came very quickly and that it wasnt scratched or damaged in any way or form and i absolutely will use this person again and definitley recommend..
4,"Excellent, dispite one flaw.","I was disappointed that the 3-D version of the movie is not the same as the one shown in theaters. Instead of the polarized system, it uses the standard color lenses. This should have been noted on the product details, as I feel misled. Still, a good movie."
3,Beware not for young children!!!!!!!!,Please use caution if your child is under 12. My daughter is a mature 8 and I thought she would really enjoy this movie. She is not the dramatic type at all. So I was surprised when she said we had to shut it off or she would throw up. I thought maybe it was from watching it in the car with the 3d effects. But then she started crying. The crying lasted 2 hours. And then for several more at bedtime. She then wokeup with a nightmare about it.I think it's a great movie for older children and adults. But if your children are young I suggest you watch the movie yourself first.I do NOT think a PG rating was accurate whatsoever. PG13 would be better.There is another part that you would find in animated porn that is not for children and was shocked to find a women was a huge exposed but bouncing up and down with a thong was in this movie.The 3d also wasn't that impressive or even noticeable.
2,Bad,I turned this off two thirds through.OK I admit the special affects were great.The story line is what got me. The lousybored family who were too concerned with work to pay attention toCoraline were turning out to be the good guys. Too bad because initiallythe parallel universe family that seemed great morphed into the family fromhell. Call me naive but that was working for me: finally a familythat took the time to be there. I don't need movies to justifylousy families with imaginative style.
3,3D ruins DVD,"I love this movie. It is great. I just do not understand why they couldn't use the same 3D tech they used in the theaters for the DVD. The 3D on this DVD is horrible. I guess I'll keep it because even in 2D it's a great movie, but I think they are just gonna try to score as much cash as they can off this movie by re-releasing it later in the year with a better 3D format. I'm not the brightest bulb in the hall, but couldn't they have formated the 3D theatre version into the DVD?"
4,Not again,"Its another movie. Your child says 'daddy daddy daddy' so you buy it. After the fact we found it significantly cheaper but who cares, we had it when they said we would, and it works wonderfully, each and every freck'in time they play it. Thanks tons."
4,A bit much for little kids.,"It was a great movie. I actually had forgotten that Neil Gaiman wrote the screenplay but I found the story to be original, engaging and a little bit creepy. It was a fun watch for everyone, including my 3 yr old sun with the incredible artwork. However, the movie does get pretty intense, so distraction may be in order for the little ones."
5,Great for kids and family,Great movie. Can be a little scary for children younger than 7. Both adults and the kids will enjoy it. You will never look at buttons the same way again!
1,A weird movie!,"I thought that this was a really weird movie. It was creepy, and reminded me of a bad dream that I couldn't wake up from. I almost left the theatre. I would recommend not buying this movie."
2,Pornography!!!!,I gave this movie 2 stars only because it had a decent story line. That said it was too scary for younger children and a bit over there heads. The most disturbing thing is the 70 years old lady dressed like a stripper!! She is all but naked with a bathing suit bottom and nipple covers (and nothing I mean nothing else) on her size double ZZ breast. Why would any decent person put that in a child's movie!!! Why am I the only person who even found it disturbing? Please protect your kids from this. I am so sorry I did not cheick it out on [...] before watching it with my kids. It ruined the whole movie.
5,LOVE IT,I bought this movie for my little girl who is 2. She loves this movie. We watch it everyday. This is a new copy for her for christmas. I love the movie myself!
1,Inappropriate for young children!,"I decided to watch this cartoon b/c my son (3 yrs old) already seen it twice. I found it offensive, inappropriate and ""dark"". The way they had the woman almost naked, what was that for? It's NOT child friendly cartoon. What is the message? Evil!!!"
4,Good Sonic,"I disagree when people say there has been evolution in their sound. While I love this band and this record it is still in some ways very commercial and tries to appeal to a very special audience (to which I belong). It is up there with their best work, really but then they have allways delivered the goods. As usual the production is a bit murky but we are used to that. The guitar playing is really up to their usual standard and I ca really recommend this record."
3,AMAZING!,"Hello! I'm Todd. I enjoyed Gish because it was smashing and powerful. Heavier than Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. I've bought this and I am giving it a three star rate because I didn't like that there were o0nly 10 songs on it! I wish I had a good mind to review such Smashing Pumpkins records but I'm too into that dumb reject, Marilyn Manson. Those Pumpkins rock away the new year. GREAT MILLENIUM MATERIAL!"
4,SP - early on,"I really enjoyed this album. I have a lot of other SP albums and it was great listening to this one after hearing all the other ones. This album definitely has their early on signature licks. ""rhinoceros"" really stands out as one of the best songs of this album."
3,On the path to greatness.,"I love the Pumpkins. Listen to ""Gish"", and you can see the rise of a terrific band. It's good music, but it hardly compares to ""Siamese Dream"" or ""Melancolly and Infinite Sadness"". If you are a fan of the band, you will appreciate this CD. My personal favorite is ""I am One"". Although it's not their musical peak (hence 3 stars), it is worth your time and money."
5,What A Start,This is the beginning of the Smashing Pumpkins' great career. The only album not built upon hype or fame this is a true masterpiece and shows off the best of the classic pumpkins. Throughout the years they have modified their sound and become very unique but this album is just great grandeur rock with awesome rocking songs and beautiful ballads. You will not be disappointed with this CD.
5,terrific,"while this is an essential recording for any music fan, it only hints at the astounding achievments that the Pumpkins would attain later on. But this is definitely one of their most rocking albums. Great songs, great arrangements, and great writing grace it from top to bottom. It's one of those albums that you will listen to once, think it's okay, but will never stop listening to it, ever."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"This album combines not only great guitar riffs, but truly shows that Billy Crogan is one of the greatest musicians of all time. From the first song titled appropriately, ""I Am One"" to the beautiful song ""Window Paine"". This album is the best album to combine complete edge and beauty since Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland."
1,Not Even an Anti-Hero,"The main character is a serial killer. I didn't identify with him, feel sympathy for him, or like him. The author complicates the novel by throwing in timecrawls -- sudden flashbacks with no warning. They make a bad novel worse.The plot explores how the killer goes wandering the country, killing at random. The author writes a thin veneer of charming sociopath, which isn't even correct from a psychological standpoint.My recommendation: burn this book for warmth while reading a good Stephen King novel."
2,Science Apartheid,"Despite my interests in history as it relates to science (and more specifically to medicine), I found this work to be sorely tedious. Nonetheless, it would have been redeemable had there been useful organization, instead wondering almost aimlessly among events not much better arranged than a high school term paper. The frequency of repetition also taxed my patience heavily. The irony of the epilogue leaving potential credibility for Linus Pauling's work with high-dose vitamin C in same way he criticized other charlatans' benefactors shouldn't be lost on the reader, but it's more likely the difficult delivery will discourage any reader from getting that far who isn't already heavily invested in evidence-based science. This certainly won't be the work that invites the lay public to be interested in science."
1,Great quality...doesn't fit,"I got this to match the front mats for my 1996 Land Cruiser. Says this will fit my truck. Does not, by a long shot. Shape is roughly correct but it's several inches too wide, making it buckle badly at each side."
4,Beautiful voice,I bought the cd for the song Sand and water. BNC has a beatiful voice but I was disappointed with the selection of songs. I guess I was expecting more ballads. Still it was enjoyable to listen to.
4,Great Natural Deodorant - That really works.,I'm big on trying natural products. Especially when there are health questions - such as the aluminum in anti-perspirants. This is a great all natural deodorant that really works too. No strong scents. If you've tried other natural/organic deodorants and gave up because they don't work. Try this one. You won't be disappointed.
3,Better than what Paul did,"The solo albums show evidence that they were spur-of-the-moment things, as they seem relatively disorderly. It was like they walked into the studio, started making beats, and had the HCP crew start rapping. The Linkin Park samples are okay; Lord's verse on the posse song is the best part of the album. Not bad, but not great either."
4,"good, but the first one's better...","I thoroughly enjoyed Callander Square, although I found the end less intriguing than The Cater Street Hangman. I was completely shocked with the first one's ending, while this one was just okay. The characters were very interesting in this novel though, and I really didn't suspect who the murderer was, but his character was too underdeveloped in my opinion. I also was disappointed that Perry showed very little interaction between Charlotte and Thomas--I was looking forward to reading about their marriage and how they were managing married life. Overall a great read if you are looking for a fun, yet sophisticated, murder mystery!"
1,Pet hair magnet,"I purchased this jacket a couple of months ago, and, while initially satisfied, I soon noticed that pet hair was attracted to it. So attracted, in fact, that any means or removing it, masking tape, lint roller, washing/drying it, praying over it, screaming at it, did nothing to remove the hairs. So if you have a pet or know someone with a pet, I would strongly reccommend that you reconsider this jacket, unless you want to look like said pet."
3,She Loves Strangers is one of my wonder year songs,"It was Monday June 8th, 1981, and I was 13 still had not told Pat how I felt about her, and would never, but this song was on my radio during recess, and it was love at first hear. I still love it after all these years. I really didn't feel this was a classic album, but it does have some tasty morsels that are really great. ""You Fool You"" is another one, and the title cut is pretty good, but the rest is all hit, or miss, but ""Heart Of Gold"" is the worst with the harmonica on it, and it was my first taste of David Johansen before I knew he was a New York Doll. Of course by this time I was cranking it up on WMMR in Philly, and this was where I first discovered Johansen. As I said before ""She Loves Strangers"" is one of my wonder year songs, and unfortunately, I couldn't get the radio stations to play it almost 24/7, and I never did tell Pat how I felt, or kissed her. I just look back at this, and just say it's a good album, but not a classic."
3,"Not as good as the first one, but o.k.!","I'm a big fan of his first album ""David Johansen"" (Blue Sky) and when I heard this I was a little dissapointed. Too much keyboards for me, bass is sometimes too reggae, but songs like ""Heart Of Gold"", Bohemian Love Pad"" make this album listenable."
3,Good for the first go,"I'm not going to lie, I like the game when I first played it. But, the story wasn't really all that good in the overall. The game play is fun, but after beating it. I seen no replay value.Now my buddy has it and loves it.(for now)"
1,Obsolete first generation HD Radio,"The Panasonic CQ-CB9900U is a sensitive, selective and good sounding unit. The disk player supports Mp3 as well as WMA playback, which is a real plus! HOWEVER, this is a first-generation HD radio which does not provide reception of the new secondary HD channels that have been added in many areas (see the Ibiquity site to obtain a listing of HD broadcasts and HD secondary channels in your area). The fun thing about the secondary (HD-2) channels is that most are being broadcast commercial free (for a while, at least). For cheap, this unit might be a good entry into HD radio... but 500 bucks is not cheap. I would watch for a price drop here!"
1,Not the original songs,"Unfortunately, there are no indications in the description that the songs were re-recorded by studio singers. DO NOT buy this CD if you are looking for the songs that you heard from the movies; these are very different and sound much like karaoke or a lounge act."
4,Strange,"This is not The Clientele. The record company is in error.There's actually 10 songs on this EP, not 5 as is listed on the back cover, and on Amazon's song list. About half the songs are very good to excellent. The other half are mediocre. But the good ones are easily worth the purchase. This band is simply dreamy."
4,Do not use my credit card information without permission.,I do not want my credit card associated with anything other than a purchase. I am not submitting a review because I attempted to do so and I saw that my credit card information came up.
3,Brain Drain,"Loved this game...at first. I couldn't wait to dive into the programs and prove once and for all that I was either a super brain, or as dumb as dirt! It's hard to get a true idea with this game because of the poor voice and written recognition. This appears over and over in the other reviews, so it wasn't an isolated incident with my game. It made it frustrating, but I learned to write and speak a certain way and it would perform better. It appears the only real object of the whole thing is to just keep practicing the same games over and over until you do better. You never really advance to anything new and different; just keep repeating the same thing like a trained animal. What good are the cognitive skills if you are bored stiff?! Fortunately I could trade it back to Amazon for credit and move on to something else."
1,Scissor... Sciiissssoooorrr... SCISSOR,Voice recognition in this game needs some work. Kind of bums your score when it doesn't recognize you voice... on ONE word. My voice isn't really all that high either.... my boyfriend had no trouble. He has a really deep voice.Aside from that... this game is just OKAY at most. I'd say try out Big Brain Academy.
3,Good and Bad,"It doesnt pick up handwriting well, and the voice calculator has problems with the number six, but its something i have gotten in the habit of doing every night"
4,Could use some improvements,"Yes I too think the recognition of your voice and writing needs to be improved upon. The game is very addicting for me. Once you get used to how it works it is very fun. I always tell it I'm in a place where I can't speak out loud just so I don't have to deal with the ""blue"" problem. I am anxious to see the next (hopefully improved) version of this game."
4,Brain age,"I was new to hand held electronic games before I tried Brain Age and Brain Age 2. I also have Parkinson's. These games seemed an outlet for me to keep my brain alert and help with my eye-to-hand coordination. The exercises are easy, it is the time limits that add challenges. I found them challenging, especially when I inadvertently selected the harder version of a math activity.These games have been beneficial for my needs. Issue I take is with the length of time it takes to move from exercise to the next one. It is frustrating to wait so long to move on. The redundancy is not really warranted. Also, I cannot use the speech feature because I get answers wrong because it doesn't recognize what I said. This is not just me. A friend who does not have Parkinson's has the same problem. Why does this program not allow more options for the stamps. I would recommend this and Brain Age 2 for older persons handicapped or not. I believe it delivers mostly what is advertized."
5,great game,"This game is awesome. Everyday, my brain gets younger by playing it. The puzzles are great and i play it all the time."
4,Educational and Fun,"Not only is this game fun, but it's educational too. It can really help improve your memory and other brain functioning skills. The game may not look, or sound, like much, but in this case, looks are deceiving. Brain Age is a lot of fun, and very addicting. And the kicker is that it's actually educational."
1,Not very brain straining,I am disappointed in the game. There are only a few games to train on and they are the same every day. Do those few games and you are done for the day. The Sudoku is fun but not worth [..].
4,"at 78 I'll try anything,",too soon to tell it if helps but feel challenged enough and jot get frustrated. Hope it helps arrived quickly
3,So so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The game is nice but as many people have pointed out voice recognition is really bad so I have opted not to do the challenges that required voice recognition. In regard to the handwritting is not as bad as voice recognition but it has its problems and some times you have to rewrite words or letters.Overall I do believe is a good game to train your brain and has many fun ways to do it.
4,XIII,"This is a really good game, and the plot goes at a tremendous place, taking a lot from JFK (you are accused of assasinating the President), graphic novels (the whole game is animated as if it was one) and other FPS (first person shooter) games, including now standards of the genre: bazooka, rifle, sniper rifle, automatic, ect. Where the games fall down, is that the minumum requirements are the bare bones. Unfortunately, I have only the minumum of some of the requirements, and as a result, often the view went erratic when I tried to aim on one person out of many. Also, a lot of characters repeat lines or words. This is a glitch, and quite obviously not for dramatic effect. Also, at a point it is too steeped in comic book lore, and the BOOOM on the screen when a grenade explodes gets irritating. But these are the only bad points. Overall, this is an enveloping game with a unique style and gameplay, let down by a lack of polish."
4,Pentagon- Pretty Decent,"The Pentagon knife from SOG (Special Operations Group) is a decent blade. The craftsmanship is above par but I am not a fan of blades not made in America. SOG gets all their metal from Taiwan so dont be surprised if the blade is not perfect out of the box. As a dagger, this is an excellent one. The serrated side is extremely sharp and will cut through alot of material. I carry this blade as a last resort weapon in Iraq and im satisfied with it. Good balance and dexterity but the metal seems pretty weak. The blade is extremely thin so be careful not to drop it as it will def bend. But for the money its a good buy."
4,Trance the way it should be,"This is trance music the way I like it, hard yet still melodic. A cycle of tension and release that will get your blood pumping."
4,Convey Ayurveda Way,"Well written, worth a read, but doesn't hit high note synergy of ayurveda life style. Amazon service rated 5 star."
5,"The ""Joy of Cooking"" for the 21st century","This is the book to cook from for delicious new flavors and dishes, and to learn from to discover the effects of foods and spicing on the body and mind. Every page is full of interesting, well researched information about food , how it changes as it is prepared, and how it effects the person who eats it. The cultural richness is delightful, and the ease with which the author moves from tradition to tradition while maintaining the angle of cooking for the various Ayurvedic body-mind types is awe-inspiring. For those looking for a wider range of culinary experience, this book is a treasure. And for those learning how to navigate the 21st century emphasis on healthful cooking, it is invaluable."
3,Only useful for Westerners,"Pros :-Easy to follow recipes-Pleasant writing style-Many useful tips regarding methods , equipment etc-Covers world cuisine-Detailed ingredient InformationCons :-Garlic and onions are not used and because of as a result of this some world wide well known ethnic recipes will not taste nice especially by ethnic people ,however for westerners it might be ok if they havent tasted the original recipe before..-Most of the recipes will appeal to westerners who dont have strong culinary traditions but for most ethnic people it falls short..."
4,A Magaizine Worth its Ballast.,"I get three ""boating"" magazines: Sailing, Sail and Soundings (a general boating magazine - highly recommended). Each one has a special place on my coffee table.The strength of this magazine is, first and foremost, the sections titled: `Perry on Design' and the `Used Boat Notebook' (and its accompanying side bar - `Value Guide'). `Perry on Design' covers briefly the designs of the new offering hitting the market. `Used Boat Notebook' is the ""Car & Driver"" review for used boats: much more thorough than `Perry'. This outstanding section covers: Impressions, Construction, What to Look for, On Deck, Down Below, Engine, Under Way and a succinct conclusion that raps it up This section alone is the main reason I get this magazine. Other reasons are the magazine's beautiful color photos and a section called `Boat Doctor', information on technique and safety.If you are a sailor, serious or a wannabe, you can't go wrong with ""Sailing"". Strongly recommended."
3,Pushing deceptive packaging to the max,"Great idea for a gift: pretty glass beads, and enough to make a few bracelets.The plastic box is at least an inch thick, implying that there are nice deep containers of beads inside. Nope. A big clear plastic insert holds very shallow containers of beads up high to make it seem that there are at least 4x as many.I can't say it's a bad product, or a bad gift. Just that this is extremely expensive for basically a few glass beads. Barely enough to make what's in the picture. Maybe not enough to make what's in the picture."
3,Maybe this music's more geared to the ladies or something,"First off, I LOVE Silk as much as my sister does. I even have all of their albums and I think that Lil' G and John-John are two of the most underrated singers out today. But after two good albums, this album went into redundant territory. The good news: ""If You"", ""Meeting In My Bedroom"", and ""Sexcellent"" are all good songs, as well as the standout vocals on ""Please Don't Go"".But most of these songs start to get old really fast; I mean, how many ways can you say, ""freak me, baby""? When they don't sing about sex, it's not much better (""Baby Check Your Friend"" is just as silly as its title). This album is just good for getting the mood right, so if anything, buy this album for your girlfriend. Then play it in the background where you two aren't paying attention to the lyrics because you're too busy, well, you know..."
2,Not A GOOD READ!,I literally had to force myself to finish this book which was one of my Book Club's selections. It was redundant and totally borning.
2,Not real enough,"I was disappointed in River of Doubt, anticipating a gripping tale about both Teddy Roosevelt and what was then the unexplored Amazon River region. Roosevelt never really emerges as a person. Even more annoying, the description of the flora and fauna of the Amazon is anthropomorphic, failing to comprehend or acknowledge the most rudimentary and accepted concepts of species development and evolution. The author repeatedly tells us that nature adapted itself and developed strategies to accomplish specific tasks, which is a backwards view to say the least. Plants and animals have no more capability to alter their physical structure than we humans do. Resultant ""strategies"" reflect nothing more than survival of variations that were more resilient than others that did not survive. This story was marred by too much emphasis on adventure and threat, too much effort to make the jungle an adversary, and not enough attention to real personalities and science."
3,Teddy did make it out of the Amazon,"Though detailed and well researched , in my opinion. It became a struggle for me to continue reading TR's journey of getting bogged down in an extremely tedious long excursion through the uncharted regions of The rain forest. I was glad to finally reach the end, as I am sure TR, his son those that survived were.Being a TR fan and of history in general, I marched through the journey with less enthusiam as the exploration continued on."
5,a wonderful audiobook,"This is one of the great audiobooks, read by Richard Ferrone. I've passed it around among friends, and they agree. Makes any commute go quickly."
5,Wish I'd been there,Great book. I read quite a few books of this type and this is one of the best. This is a part of Teddy's life I new nothing about. I'm surprised there hasn't been a movie made from it yet.
2,boring slog thru the jungle,"I thought this would be a fascinating adventure strory with some cool history and natural science thrown in. Instead it was a boring, repetitive slog through the jungle that had me wishing the whole group would be slaughtered by the indians so the book would end! How many times do I need to be told mosquitoes cause malaria, T.R. was disappointed by his election loss, etc.? Where was the editing?"
5,The River of Doubt,This is an awesome adventure! I had no idea such an event took place . . very informative and kept my interest to the very end - everyone should read this!
4,The River of Doubt Has Many Tributaries,"This fascinating account of Theodore Roosevelt's disastrous trip on the River of Doubt is well-written and meticulously researched. It has many ""micro histories"" on the flora and fauna of Brazil (hint: don't read this outside around a lot of bugs) as well as the native peoples of the region. My only frustration had to do with all the diversions when, on a few occasions, I just wanted to find out what happened next. The epilogue tells the reader the sometimes tragic personal stories once the journey ended and was one of the portions of the book that I shall remember the most. I read this as a book club assignment and we had a lengthy and lively discussion on Roosevelt, his son, and the men who played such a critical part of their journey. If you like a lot of detail in harrowing stories of exploration and adventure, this would be a perfect choice."
4,River of Doubt,This was a good history lesson for me. Really had never thought of Theodore Roosevelt as this agressive and adventerous man. Very enjoyable read or to listen to as I did.
4,Well researched,"This was a gripping read although with a slightly slow start. Candice Millard thoroughly researched the background to this book and gave an accurate account of the river and of the forest through which it ran. The problems they encountered, Roosevelt's attention to record keeping under the most difficult of circumstances and the lack of communication with the rest of the world left a deep impression on me. The characters and their relationships with each other were well filled in."
5,The River of Doubt,"Five years after he left office in the late winter of 1914, former president Theodore Roosevelt set off on an exposition to map out an uncharted river that snaked its way through the Amazon jungle. The strenuous journey lasted four months, nearly cost him his life - and probably led to his early death in January of 1919. If you want to understand what an incredible human being TR was, you need to read this book. I cannot recommend it enough.Here is a link to ACTUALLY hear the ACTUAL voice of the ACTUAL Theodore Roosevelt during the long ago campaign of 1912. They sure don't make Republicans like that anymore. Come to think about it, they don't make Democrats like that anymore either:[...]We sure could use him now.Tom DeganGoshen, NY"
4,Not just another book on TR,"I'm a huge TR fan but was reluctant when this book was recommended to me. I thought I knew everything worth knowing about the man and a micro-history like this didn't seem likely to add much. I was wrong! His ordeal in the Amazon basin was amazing and Ms. Millard tells the story in a very engaging way. While most readers will know how it turns out for TR, there are a whole cast of characters that you begin to care about and their lives during and after the trip are nearly of equal interest. The book is well paced and the story is framed in an easy to follow yet dramatic way. I highly recommend this book."
4,Very Entertaining,"After reading many books on TR, this was a book that I had to get. While reading both Morris books on TR this seemed to be a great add on to my study of the former President. This is a really good book. The author, a former writer for National Geographic does a good job of keeping this book on the entertaining side.The story is really amazing, to the point where you might ask yourself - what was TR thinking going on such a trip - was he tired of life and ready to be done with it? One small critique of the work is the fact that the author maybe spends a bit to much time talking about the ecology of the Amazon where it almost feels like filler. But, the context is needed, but maybe not so much.This is a good book. Pick it up for a road trip and sit back for a wild adventure.JVD"
2,Inside,"David Sanborn has a solid base in the bop vocabulary. However, this record is a bit mild, even for him."
2,Fine game but ....,I wanted this game for a time.When I got it it cost only $9.I got it and played it and got it done in only at max 3 hr.And all that it is alot of mini games.If you are very young or are buying it for someone that is young (Like 9 or younger)it is fine.Also if you are going to wach the moive do not play the game.It tells the moive very good.All and all it is not my type of game.
5,A great purchase,"The review by Cook's Illustrated Magazine was right on. This colander is sturdy, doesn't tip over in the sink, drains well, cleans well and is attractive. My husband is the vegetable gardener and to get him to use this new colander, I pitched out my 30 year old green Tupperware colander. He likes this RSVP one, too. The 5-qt. size works well for everything."
5,THE BEST!!!,"Short and sweet...this has got to be the best colander on Earth! Drains almost instantly, extremely well-made, and beautiful. Buy it, period!"
4,"Nice light, but with a rubber pushbutton","This light has excellent build quality, excellent illumination and comes with a good cordura nylon case. It even has a new shape that doesn't roll. However, I'm not enamored with the pushbutton on-off switch, as I have to try several times occasionally to turn the light on/off (the previous model base was twisted to turn the light on or off)."
3,"Cover fits perfectly, pusher does not","Same problem others have experienced - I carefully matched up model numbers to be sure I ordered the right cover for my work bowl after my original one was damaged. The new cover fits my bowl perfectly, but the food pusher does not fit in the new cover, rendering it almost useless. I called KitchenAid and they agreed to send me a replacement pusher, but I've never received it."
2,"Not as ""Good"" as I Had Thought...","I bought this product in ""good condition"" and when I got it, I instantly noticed that the collector's box it came in was old and frayed. The DVDs inside had fingerprints all over them and one of the DVDs had a large crack. It's unplayable. I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and now it's a choice between not giving him anything for Christmas or giving him an old-looking broken set of DVDs. I am not too happy with this."
4,Seem to enjoy,"Both my dogs seem to enjoy these. I see where other posters say theirs didn't like them to much, mine didnt at first either. Now they both site and happily chew away. Best part is they last for WEEKS. Sometime I will take a little food and smear on one. I would buy again. Would also look for something in same brand that has flavoring or a center mixture to it."
5,dog loves these,"I have a 40 pound GSP mix who loves to destroy stuff. These bones last him a couple months, where most other toys last hours before he has them torn up. Great product does not break off in chunks."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"My dog is a very aggressive chewer, but when I bought this product in the store it lasted him a long time so i bought it again on line so save some money but for some reason the one I bought off line barely lasted 2 weeks and the one I had bought in the store lasted him about 6. I'm not sure what the problem was with durability the second time but I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great Toy,Sturdy and my dogs all love it. The Nylabone toys are always a hit in our house and they last the longest.
2,Disappointing.,"This is the recommended size for my 52 lb dog, but she quit trying to chew on it almost right away. It seems to be too large and hard for her to manage. I've also tried the next size down (Wolf) with similar disappointing results."
3,nylabone,I thought the wolf size would be to big for my dachshund but its just right they dont prefer it over other dog toys but they do use it when its the first thing they see probably could buy the same thing at a local store
2,Bone has sharp edges,I don't really know how the solar snowflakes are until next christmas. the nala bone has sharp edges when my dog chews it. He is a pittbull/lab so he really chews. I would like to find a bone that he won't destroy. please let me know if you have anything like that.
5,Great for bully breeds,"We have 2 Boxers, a French Bulldog and an English Bulldog, and they prefer to chew Nylabones. The Nylabones last about 2 to 3 months before they are worn down on the ends. They keep our furniture safe. Our Frenchie weighs 22 pounds, the bulldog weighs 42 lbs. and the 2 Boxers are about 65 each, and the wolf size is great for all of them, even though they are strong chewers."
3,My dog loves them but...,"My 26 pound puggle loves these, he is an agressive chewer and he prefers these over anything else. The only issue I have is he wears them out in around a week. It is still better than him chewing something else (furniture etc) though!"
5,ok,my 30 lb dog loves this and uses it daily. after about a month of use one end is completely worn out but she only likes to chew on that end where she feels she's making progress. could probably last her another month and the size is ok for her to hold down while chewing.
5,Nylabone,"I bought these for my dog and my daughter's dog for Christmas gifts. They are a hit. The dogs would switch off and steal each other's bone. They last months and months - even with my pit bull. They must taste good, too."
1,maybe I purchased a nock off??,"So i've been searching for the miracle chew toy and this particular bone was highly recommended for my pit. she was only four months at the time. they say this bone lasts and lasts but the one I purchased literally fell apart. She chewed through this bone with her puppy teeth in a matter of 20 minutes. there was nothing ""souper"" about this bone! I was bummed because it was expensive and all it did was create a smelly mess. she is now nine months old and chews down and destroys every toy and bone in her path. I think my next purchase will be the nyla wolf bone. Until then im still searching!"
2,wrong item,sent the wrong nylabones but i kept them because i didnt feel like dealing with the hassle of returning them.
5,woof,"I have a 7 pound dog and she likes this. She is 5 but likes to chew it. Not sure how they get bacon flavor in there cause its hard plastic, cant smell it."
2,Absolutely no baon flavor in it,"I bought this bone for my two beagles. But they don't chew this bone often. If this bone has bacon flavor, I bet they will not only chew it everyday, they will finish the bone in several weeks. This bone has only bacon color. This is just an ordinary plastic bone."
4,What an album!,"Lila's voice has come such a long way since her first album. It has transformed from a somewhat monotonous voice to one that is so pure and filled with emotion. Her singing has gotten so beautiful that each song is filled with spark and a life. And she is enunciating so much better on this album than on her first. She sings the lyrics with clarity and with proper amount of emotion. The album is really well put together. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it didn't have enough ballads. The ballads really are the best songs. Just compare these ballads to those on her first album, and you can see how her voice has gotten so pure. This is the best follow up album I have heard because the growth in Lila's voice is so evident."
3,A true review,"This is not Lila's best work. Her first and third albums are by far the best. There are a few good songs on this album, but some seemed too childish for a person with her great voice to be singing. If you can't get enough of Lila, then I'd recommended getting this album because it may not be her best but most of it is worth listening to. If you want another great song that's not on any of her albums check out ""To Get Me To You"" off of the Hope Floats Soundtrack."
5,*~Something about Lila McCann~*,"I have a wide variety of music interests. Im usually not much of a country listener, but Lila is definiteley an exception! She is talented, beautiful, and a good role model! In this CD you see Lila's voice mature since her previous album ""Lila.""She sings about more mature issues and this album has a lot of songs about *love*~ Some of the upbeat songs that stand out are With You, Rymes With, Crush, and Hit By Love. Those are all great songs to listen to!She also has some ballads that I think are absolutely beautifully sung~ You're Gone, Kiss Me Now, and When You Walked Into My Life. Theres not one song thats not worth listening to!I dont use the skip button when I'm listening to this CD~ It's a great cd that I reccommend to buy! She's one of those singers that is unique and deserves more publicity than shes been getting lately! It's worth the money and you wont be sorry! :-)"
1,YUK!,"A retarded woman ends up killing a guy who is annoying her and a bum who got her pregnant ends up visiting her in the mental institution. That's the plot. The acting is OK, but the story is ridiculous and nothing even remotely interesting happens during the entire movie."
5,"Easy to understand, great ideas","I simply love this book. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. The pictures are outstanding and help show step by step. This is a perfect book for someone who just starting out in the cake decorating. It even includes little side bar tips to help you. If you can not take a decorating class, this book is the next best thing!!!"
3,Great book but not worth the price,"This is a great book - very simple, informative, great pictures. But it's pretty thin and therefore, not worth the $33 I paid for it. If you can get it for under $20, go for it. But anything over that, it's not worth the money. (I bought it for my mother who is enjoys decorating cakes as a hobby)."
2,Couldn't make it through this Masterpiece.,"Considering the reviews here on Amazon, which call this book a surreal masterpiece, I expected that it would be something special. I expected that the work would be difficult, like Moby Dick, which I had to read twice before I could enjoy it. Despite my best intentions, I had to give up about half-way through the novel. The reason: I didn't care about any of the characters. In fact I disliked every single one of them."
2,A misfire,"Revolver aka Blood in the Streets aka In the Name of Love is a disappointingly bland and overlong Sergio Sollima cop thriller with a miscast Oliver Reed complete with bad American accent (despite playing an Italian prison warden!) and Fabio Testi only marginally less wooden and ineffectual than usual caught up in a political assassination and kidnapping. Nothing out of the ordinary with some absurd plotting (a politician faced with death threats walking casually through the Place Vendome just so he can get killed, a ludicrous jailbreak from a prison with only rotten wood over the shower windows), the last reel is fairly good when the politics briefly kicks in and the movie refuses to go for the soft and easy ending, but it's outstayed its welcome by then.A decent extras package includes a featurette with Testi and Sollima plus trailer and stills gallery, although the 1.85:1 transfer is grainy in places."
3,Snake Eyes...,"Oh no! The army's been dumping more horrid chemicals in the desert! This time it's effected the natural order by turning harmless rattlesnakes into hyper-aggressive killers! No one is safe from the venomous fangs of these slithery fiends! They can even bite through jeep tires! Can a herpitologist (Sam Chew) find a way to deal w/ these vipers of doom?? RATTLERS is an ok movie, w/ some mildly exciting scenes and minimal carnage. Meanwhile, SNAKE PEOPLE is a wild affair w/ Boris Karloff as a voodoo guy and exotic dancing legend Tongalele as the red hot voodoo priestess! Yessiree!! Watch also for the cannibal women!..."
5,Work Cart,"Purchased this cart to use at work and I really like it...Light weight, yet very durable. Very pleased with price, and quality"
1,How can I Review Something I Have Not Received.,"Don't know what to say, about this item, because I have not received the game yet, or the book."
4,Another winner from the German duo!,"Dieter Bohlen and Tomas Anders have done it again and Modern Talking is definitely back! The songs are reminescent of the group's typical sound of the late 80's, but with a great 90's update. The music is fast-paced and energetic, the choruses are as catchy and infectious as ever, and the background singers are prominent. The only downside to this album, for me, are the slow songs. I've never been a fan of Dieter's slow material. This album is a must-have, not just for the extraordinary new material, but for the Space Mix medley which includes many updated classics not included on the ""Back For Good"" album."
3,Right on the Mark,"The DVD of ""The Mirror Crack'd"" is the usual Christie as we have all come to expect. It is an entertaining who-done-it taking place in the English countryside; fete and all.I have seen Angela Lansbury panned as Miss Marple, but I beg to disagree with those reviews. I found Ms. Lansbury a very convincing Marple and I enjoyed her performance very much.I did, however, find Elizabeth Taylor predictable in her performance as well as Rock Hudson playing her husband."
4,Old Home Week,"This piece is fun from start to finish. An ""inside"" view of some wonderful English architecture and an equally inside view of established 60's era stars having a good time ""hamming it up"" in a classic whodunnit with some style and a twister ending ( but what else would you expect from Agatha )?Although this is not the best of the series--I love it that Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson are together--and it is fun to guess which caracter has had the most cosmetic surgery!"
2,Disappointed,"A fun cast, but not one of them looks like they wanted to be there making this movie. And it shows."
3,neat little tool,"I bought one of these a few years back and the part that goes around the key chain broke shortly after. I bought another as a gift. Just be warned, this model DOES NOT have the can opener. It has the nail file, a pretty useless tool unless you're stranded on a desert island and detest biting your nails. Overall it's a great tool that fits seamlessly on a keychain and doesn't get in the way at all."
4,the book,the book came in great condition no complaints here. this book helped me to complete the game i was playing thank you
2,Has Prima heard of copy editing?,"I have never seen so many sentances that just end, with nothing continued on the next page, so many typos, so much stuff left out. This is the worst game guide I have ever read through !!Altho, I must say fable is an awesome game, and its worth it just to have the reference for the creatures and the weapons."
3,"Good seed, but much more expensive","This appears to be good quality seed to attract and satisfy a wide variety of birds in your back yard. It's much more expensive than a similar 10-pound bag of seed from Lowe's or Dollar General, both of whom sell a 10-pound bag of seed for about $6. I have used both and haven't noticed any difference in how the birds act. In fact, I have both types in feeders side-by-side right now. Kaytee needs to help us all understand why theirs costs more."
5,All the Time!,"I wear this watch daily and am very pleased with it. the price was amazing and it looks like a very high end item that would cost MUCH more. I havea other timepeices, both expensive and costume, but this is my favorite."
2,Insufficient for full-figure/high-impact,"As a 34DD, I have struggled for a long time to find a sports bra adequate for high-impact activity. This is okay, but there is so much bounce, the velcro straps dig into your shoulders, especially if you wear for a longer period of time, and after several runs and washes, the support is just not great. I am MUCH happier with Moving Comfort's Maia Sports Bra... it is amazing!!!!"
4,Gap Gauge,"It's simple and effective. You easily get an accurate rating on your spark plug gap, and you can use the hole to pry the electrode open if need be. Very convenient tool to have if you're a Do-It-Yourselfer."
5,Well worth the money!,It's written for the lay person who needs to formulate IT policy. It gives both policy statement examples and background data to permit the reader to formulate policies to suit their business needs. It was exactly what I was looking for.
1,Do NOT buy for chinchillas,I bought this item (not from Amazon) and have had lots of problems:1) not easy to put together2) chinchillas are able to chew and break the wires...they got out of the cage several times before we figured out what they were doing3) only had for a little over year and the cage is rusting4) If you have chinchillas.....I would NOT recomend this item!
3,It Works but...,"I ordered this book because I saw the article in Woman's World. I thought I was going to get more information, but it was just full of his reasoning why and what he did. Nothing is really backed by scientific reasoning, at least not in this book. This method worked for him and I'm not mad at him for sharing. I have been following the program for just two weeks and I've lost about 8lbs give or take. People are already telling me that they can see the difference. I'm a person that hates the word diet, has never been able to follow one for a full day even when I've attempted to try. This plan is good for me because one day of healthy food is a great way for me start focusing on my health. In a nutshell I wasn't really impressed with the book, easy read though, however the plan does work."
1,SB-L110 Battery,"This battery does NOT fit ALL Samsung camcorders, as stated in Amazon's descriptive material.I was trying to find a battery for a Samsung SC-D353 Mini DV camcorder. While it does fit several Samsung camcorders, there are many models it doesn't fit. Mine happens to be one of the many that it won't fit. I have since returned the battery to Amazon for a refund."
1,Origamim nightmare,"The whole program is a fiasco from the begining. From answering the phone during teaching, speaking japanese to friend to even some lewdness on the cameraman/producer/director's part. THe whole thing is a big NO for anybody especially for children. This is C grade cheap film with poor choice of models, bad teaching style and awful camerawork. This can be aptly called ""Origami by dummies."""
1,Sam's amateur home video,"There is a director who's named Sam,He has no skills at all with a cam.To list all that's done wrong,It would take much too long,Suffice it to say it's a sham.Save your money. Save your time. Consider root canal or childbirth as less painful alternatives."
5,Sequential Wrist band,I bought and used these bands for a charity pub crawl and they were easy to use and cheap. The perfect fit for what I needed. I would purchase these again if ever needed.
1,Cheap,"I never used this product, it was useless. I would not buy this product again or recommend it. I ended buying some from schoolbox."
2,Disappointment,I was really excited to get these candles but was left disappointed. They did NOT sparkle or stay lit.... would never buy again.
2,"If He Writes Another Novel, It'll Be Great","Oh, I so hope Nick Cave continues to write, because he is a great storyteller. But he better get a better editor. Great elements: great characters, great plot, great use of language, and all for naught, regrettably, and I'm still not sure why. (Yes, I am a fan of his music -- Murder Ballads reduces me to tears at times -- oh, what a remarkable translator of tragedy!) This book will be more interesting after he writes more novels. Can I recommend And The Ass Saw The Angel? -- alas no; you Nick Cave fans will read it and love it, but for you folks who aren't yet devotees, get his music; you will be shocked and beguiled, and you will become fans of that, I am sure."
4,What a dark and amazing vision,"If you are a fan of Nick Cave's music, there would be no reason why you shouldn't read this book. It's intense, gruesome, disturbing, but yet beautiful in the way he uses language and keeps you interested in the story. It's a great view of a southern hell: full of fundamentalists and inbred hillbilly's. My only critiscm is that it does tend to ramble a bit at the end, but with such great prose it didn't bother me too much."
2,"Dear Nick, Keep making records.","The greatest Vogon poetry ever committed to wood pulp. Cave takes great pains to fit that gargantuan head up his pontificating anus. Hence, the ass saw the angel, and vice versa.To be fair, I did not finish the book. In fact, I've read only the prologue. But that small taste was enough to inform me that this was definitely not my cup of tea."
5,1 Giant leap,"Para mi uno de los mejores documentales sobre la actualidad que se ha podido rodar.Para reflexionar sobre las importancias Reales de la Vida Misma.Solo puedo recomendarlo con la maxima categoria de estrellas,se lo reciomiendo a todo el mundo.....,Sobre todo a los que estan al poder en la Actualidad!"
5,Truly eye-opening.,"Everyone should watch this DVD at least once. It provides an eye-opening view of our relation to all of humankind. The images are amazing. The music is incredable. And the editing is first-rate. It's broken up into chapters (money, masks, culture, inspiration, God(faith, blasphemy, unity), sex, time, confrentation, death, happy). These make it easy to pick and choose what you want to watch again... and again."
4,A Giant Loop,"Imagine taking musical and spoken voices from around the world and blending them into a poetic, sonic mix. A Giant Leap is a Giant Loop of planetary sounds and soulful reflections on everything from Sex to the Sacred. Here's a production you can re-visit from time to time and uncover finer nuances of meaning or wilder currents of emotion."
3,Music marks,"A mix ofBarakawith supposedly philosophical talks, assembling the pieces from different continents is presented rather in a chaotic way murky Main Menu is.Some stars for music."
5,Never stop watching,"Very audacious project of the guys. Really nice idea traveling around the world collecting opinions, sounds, images and snapshots from the most distinct kind of cultures.Apparently, they restricted a little bit by just interviewing people that speaks English. This could have imposed some limitations, but it is overall a ""must-see"". I watched it many many times and show to every friend to go to my home. Really, is very insightful and entertaining. If it was just the sound, it would be already very nice, therefore, I think the CD can be also another good option. Make sure you don't miss the Extras!"
2,Graphic SF Reader,"The JLA as Moreau like beasts are sent on a mission, in this Elseworlds story. Then they end up back on the island. Definitely not too flash."
5,awesome,Love these tapes. My older son got saved after watching a donut man video years ago. Now I'm showing them to my younger son. So far he enjoys them.
3,Entertaining,"While I consider this Captain America book's not the best CAPTAIN AMERICA books, but it still interesting to be read. The ""duplicate"" Captain America sounds too so-so to me, but BART SEARS penciling this book that made me took the book on the first place."
1,Just bad,"This series was just not very good. The art is overboard, over-the-top trying to look cool and failing miserably. The plot was uninteresting."
1,Forza The Samurai Sword Workout,I wish I could review this item but it is impossible to review something you never received. I was sent the wrong DVD. I tried to notify Amazon through customer service but found myself being sent back to the same page over and over again. Anyone want to buy a kick-boxing DVD cheap?
2,Not for true beginners - good for beginners who have done yoga before,"I bought this to try and get my husband engaged in yoga, but unfortunately it may have done the opposite. When I first had a yoga class they not only discussed poses, they discussed breath...which is very important. Breath was not discussed until the end of the pose section and was very limited. There were no block or strap modifications offered for the poses...very important for people new to practice and even for those, like me, who are still not very stretched out. My husband was having a very difficult time without modifications and needed more direction about how to modify. I have been doing yoga on and off for awhile so it was a good refresher for me."
1,Not Pleased,"I purchased this Yoga DVD for Beginners b.c the reviews said it was a good exercise to start in with for the morning and finish off with for the night. In my experience with Yoga which is beyond beginners levels i am very displeased with this DVD from Rodney Lee! It only had 3-4 movements for each morning and night time routine. At no time during this DVD did i get a good stretch, have the feeling of accomplishment, self relaxation or at peace! Very Displeased!"
4,"So far, so good","The product came in a very timely manner. Thus far, they are working great. Haven't had them long enough to speak to their longevity, however."
3,Does the job,"I used to use Sony DVDs from a local retailer and they worked okay. I bought the Taiyo because of the professional quality and great reviews. So far I've burned a couple of movies as a back up. They do okay but ONLY if I use a slow burning speed. Already had two copies that didn't work perfectly at 16x speed. So - just the same as the old Sony's. I hope that they at least last ""professionally"" long."
5,Audrey Hepburn Collection,Very nice set of Audrey Hepburns movies well packaged and arrived very quickly. Totaly satisfied with this purchase. These movies are timeless. I prefer this version of Sabrina with Bogart to the Harrison Ford remake.
5,Wonderful,"Loved this 3 movie set with Audrey Hepburn. What could be better than watching her in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", unless iis Sabrina..."
1,roman holiday,"The DVD won't play at all. (the other 2 is okay) For some reason our player cannot read this DVD. Is it possible if i can return it? Please advice.Also, follow up on the Microwave rice cooker that I ordered , until now I haven't received it. Please advice if you sent it too..tks."
2,Bad DVD - defective and only partial refund!,"I got this triple-movie collection, and Roman Holiday switched from English to Italian about 15 minutes into the movie! There weren't even subtitles! We could not watch it at all. I returned it as defective, and wanted a replacement DVD, but I was only given partial refund. Boo. What a rip."
3,Product arrived damaged,"Purchased this dvd set as a gift for a friend and was pretty bummed that it arrived smashed. Ended up keeping it for myself since it was damaged. When this was addressed with the seller, he accused me of wanting to score a freebie, which wasn't the case at all. First time in all of my amazon purchases that anything was ever wrong."
5,Great DVD!!,"I would recomend this DVD to anyone. It is fun, inventive, and educational. It can keep partents attention as well as children's. Also, it contains the only shows with both Joe and Steve, which makes it even more fun with great interaction between the two."
4,Good Dictionary & Thesaurus,Bought this for a friend from Mexico trying to learn English. She has used it and likes it. No complaints
4,good,works for me. i use this for crossword puzzles and other games. it comes in handy. i would recomend this to anyone
2,Sadly Lacking,"I purchased this book as a bedside companion for quick look ups of new words while reading non fiction or novels. Like most things that try to be two things at once it fails. It is neither a good dictionary, being too limited in scope, and not the the best thesaurus for the same reason. Many of the words I have looked up do not appear at all, and they were not that esoteric. So I find myself going back to my old American College Dictionary and International Thesaurus repeatedly. I can understand why it is recommended by teachers of young children and people who are not proficient in English, but for a bright high school or college student it is way too limited. I do not recommend it and am looking for something well beyond the basic."
1,Not for Chrysler 4.7 Ltr,These were recommended by Amazon Garage for a 2006 Jeep Commander 4.7 Liter. I installed these and with in 1000 miles I started to receive check engine codes. I traced the problem to these plugs and found the electrodes worn back to the ceramic. They are not meant for this engine. I am still waiting on Amazon for a full refund. Damage to this engine can result. Use the Champion Plugs listed in the engine compartment.
5,This is the best we have seen so far,"My 3 years old son has been fascinated about tractors since he was 1 years old. ... This one I purchased him for last Christmas and he loves it a lot. I like the narration of this film, because it is realistic, without any stupid stunts, but still it is interesting for a young child. This farm has a lot of really big equipment and that is what my son loves!!"
3,Ho-Hum,"I wanted some rousing military marches. Many of the selections on this album I never heard before. I wasn't satisfied with the sound quality, which was muted. I guess it would be okay if all you want is some quiet, background military music."
4,"Great animation, Top notch Monsters.",This Godzilla is exactly what Montser movies should be in the 2000's. Great animation and great fight scenes!Sadly the DVD is not so good so I take out 1 star.
1,A Hot Mess,"I loved Gen X Cops so I was really excited to see this one but it was horrible.The characters were really out there.The English dubbed is terrible.I don't know why they didn't have a chinese version with subtitles.I love Stephen Fung but his character in this movie was just plain goofy,even Alien was way over the top.I bet Nicholas TSE was glad that he wasn't involved with this mess."
2,Brunetti is German?,"Once you get over the fact that our favorite Venetian commissario is speaking German, the series is fun to watch because you see more of Venice than in any other film that has been shot there since Don't Look Now. The camera goes down little back streets and in front of familiar landmarks, inside grand palazzi and modest apartments, all without ever giving the appearance of a staged set. For Venice lovers, it is a wonderful thing to figure out where the characters are at any time. You find yourself stopping the disc to look at the street markers, or repeating the opening credits over and over so you can see your favorite hotel. Don't know how this series would fare for those who are just attuned to the procedural plot points, and don't care."
1,Nothing special at all,"I love Blue, and Simon was one of my favorite singers in the group. However, I was very dissapointed with this CD. Simon seems unmotivated throughout the CD, and each song sounds the same. There was no passion throughout the CD, and he sounds lazy. Download the songs, don't buy this CD."
2,Hitmen pick the wrong victim and hilarity ensues.,"Let us see what we shall see in this film- Two hitmen go on this incredible rampage and know that the police are just about to arrest them,Why not get a hostage and that will fix everything.One scene is right out of Death Proof,When Stuntman Mike introduces himself to his future victims.You know Quentin Tarantino would like this film,Except for the lack of cameos.This Jason Impey film is almost an Urban Legend,Many versions exist due to censors questioning and Maxim Media has released this one.So film is a flashback,grindhouse...Zombie subplot..That about covers it"
3,chiness stereotypes about American,"Dragonwing is a novel, somewhat, interesting since it shows us soft Chiness stereotypes about American."
4,Dragon Wings,"This book is about a boy and his father Moon Shadow and Windrider.A young boy named Moon Shadow is 8 years old he joined his father so that he can go to America. Moon's father lives in San Francicso, California but the son and father have never seen eachother. Moon's father is to belive in his dream with Moon, his father is willing to endure the Mockey of the Chinese seperation of his wife and country. What ever obstacle there is he is to make his dream come true."
3,Flying to Close to the Sun,"Yep flips convention on its head. The father in this book is the technologically forward thinking one and it is the son who who clinging to the old ways and its accompanying superstitions.Sometimes, Yep's attempts to set his characters' stories against historical events -SanFrancisco earthquake, Wright brother's manned flight, Chinese immigration- seems a little forced. The book enfolds in three distinct acts which seem a little disjointed.A fascinating way to get your early twentieth-century, west-coast history, but ultimatley, not the strongest book to be nominated for the Newberry Honor as this one was."
2,A book that goes on and on......and on ..and on...and on,"For the first half the book keeps going on and on. It never stops talking.. And few of the chapters are about drugs, It is a good story but very very slow..and takes a while to get to the point."
5,A good book!,Dragonwings was a exciting and intresting book. It gave me an idea about what it was like to live around the time of the Gold Rush.Which was very helpful for 4 th grade Gold Rush history unit in school. The story also gave me a good idea about how it is to be imagrint coming a different culture and country and that we (Americans) should respect every way of life.
2,"DRAGONWINGS, was an interesting novel for me.","I am an ESL student in GSU. I came from to Mexico City and I would like to share with you, my own pint of view about ""dragonwings"". Reading this book was very interesting for me also was a cultural book. This book is interesting because is relating many activities that Chines people do in the USA. In the same way it contains many themes that make it interesting for the reader. This book is cultural for me, because is teaching or showing the costumes of the Chinese people and their traditions. The book, I think has a message and the message probably is: ""Keeping the family together is better than the material things""."
4,A well written book,"I had to read this book in the 6th grade. I am now a freshman in highschool. Personally, I like books with a bit more action and didn't enjoy it very much. Yet many of my classmates enjoyed Dragonwings. It has a wonderful plot and vivid characters. Descriptive and thought provoking. If you are mature enough and can 'take the heat' you would probably like it."
5,The most wonderful book I've ever read,"I highly recommend this book to anyone...adult or child. I thought this book was a touching story of family and hopes and dreams. I, too, thought it was boring at the beggining, but I got more into it at about chapter 2. I hope more people read this book. Laurence Yep has written a very good book. :)"
1,Kimball is a phony,"I've encountered Glenn on numerous occasions. He hawks so-called ""hidden"" works allegedly ""suppressed"" by church authorities over the centuries, but his claims are false. Everything he claims is ""suppressed knowledge"" is actually part of the vast canon of known Apocypha, or psueudo-Biblical writings long known to be forgeries. These things were regularly sold to credulous believers during the middle ages and even earlier, just as con artists sold fake sacred nails and finger bones allegedly from saints and even Jesus himself.People have been falling for this con for centuries, and they'll continue to do so. I don't know if Kimball knows he's selling phony material, or actually believes he's found something new. In either case, it's pretty pathetic.Don't waste your money. Much better books are available."
2,Poor Quality...,This is even worse quality than they say it will be when it first begins. The movie first starts off telling you that these are real incidences that survalance cameras have caught. The film is very blury even for survalance video. The editors then digitally enlarge the action part of the video but it still deos not show enough quality to even reveal the identity of the persons involved.
3,more of the same,"3 people mixed this c.d and it shows.Musical choices everyone likes make for unsurprising listening.I told myself if I came across another disc with ""Finally"" on it that I wouldn't go near it.However the excellent music that is on this disc like Mondo Grosso and Eric Kupper are so superlative that it is worth buying for those artists alone.Solus' ""Fade"" opens the disc and it is BRILLIANT.The other Body and Soul discs are very good particularly if you don't have any of the tunes from other sources.This disc had me appreciating even more my excellent Australian only H-Foundation double C.D ""Destination Australia 001"". Hippee and Halos' selections are not on every other disc you'll come across,but kick so nice and funkily that you'll be looking for more of their stuff very smartly."
4,Could have been a Classic,"I really liked this film,and I wasn't bored,but it could have been a classic with some changes,and the acting was great,especially Cher.This could have been her second Oscar.I'm going to watch this DVD again tonight."
4,Terrific for the price,"After reading other reviews I expected them to split -- and they did. What I didn't expect is that they are rock solid, good looking and perfect for the two 11-pound front speakers in our home theater. I glued and clamped the two pieces that split, redrilled all the holes with a bit 1/64th inch larger and put the stands together with no problem. Buying smaller screws as someone else suggested would also work. The result: two thoroughly usable stands for a laughably low Amazon price."
2,SANUS SYSTEMS BF-24B Wood Speaker Stands,"Look reasonable.However, they are made out of worthless MDF, NOT real wood, which split on both stands as I was putting them together.MDF should be banned from furniture manufacture"
3,Wood cracks easily during assembly,"I've got a pair of Bose 901's. The stands designed for these speakers are $150 and not my favorite style. When I saw the Sanus stands listed for about $30 I figured they were worth a shot. Shipping was free and very fast (2 days).Even though my speakers are much heavier than what the Sanus stands are designed for, they sit atop them pretty stable (and I like the way they look). The hole the stand has for threading speaker wire was too small and I had to redrill it to make it larger.One negative point I'll make is that, during assembly, I made the mistake of overtightening a few of the screws. Be very careful not to do this, because the wood will split VERY easily. I've got three hairline cracks in the wood now but, so far, they're still holding together.If you can avoid the cracks during installation, these are great stands for the money."
3,C'mon Sanus we should not have to buy smaller screws or re-drill the holes!!!,"Read the reviews about the stand's pillars cracking, but thought I'd give 'em a try anyway. Price was right after using my Discover cashback. I didn't buy smaller screws or re-drill the holes like some other reviewers. Why should we have to??? Sanus should fix this with a model upgrade. Hey maybe some real wood. I did spray the screws and the holes with Dupont Teflon Multi-Purpose Spray. Great stuff. I use it mainly on my bike's chain. Get it at Lowes. I still got a hairline crack on one of the pillars. The screws went in with almost no effort, so it's gotta be the cheap synthetic wood, and the fact that the holes are close to the edge of the pillars.I also used a little wood glue on each pillar so the hairline crack is no big deal. The stands are functional but I would not purchase another pair."
4,Good stands for cheap price,Stands are not wood but paticle board with a flat paint finish. Spray with a clear top coat of poly or varnish and they look much better. Still for the price a good deal.
1,Are they made of cardboard?!!,"The design is good, but they are made of a poor quality material. It is almost impossible not to crack them when mount the screws.They better made the supports of real wood. The manual instead contains a lot of good quality paper and many pages of instruction as for a dvd player :))), at least.Also, the parts are extremely carefully packed, but ...I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,sanus speaker stands,"I like these stands but,the four supports-the boards between the stand base and the speaker base need to be replaced.When I receive the stands the pre-drilled holes were not large enough for the included screws and they split.Other than the four supports the stands are ok."
2,Cheap,"They look great, are easy to put together. The pre-drilled holes were not drilled deep enough and the posts cracked. I noticed one of them had lines running from one hole to the other and it split the post when i put the screws in. I am not some guy who does this stuff once in a while, I do this kind of stuff on a daily basis. I would send them back but it was less hassle to glue them. I would not recomend this product. If you do buy them PLEASE re-drill the holes before putting screws in."
2,Composite wood garbage,I bought two sets of these for my surround speakers. Upon assembly the pillars cracked when tightening the screws into 3 of the pillars with pre drilled holes. Avoid.
1,Good coaster material...,Listening to this cd bordered on the painful. Many times in the past Aphex Twin has pushed the limits of what can be called music. In this case RDJ found that limit and kept right on cruising. I feel dumber and a few dollars poorer for having bought it.
5,unbelievable,"lets just say this is the best of aphextwin, he just keeps gettin better and better, and this release sure does prove what he can really do, Windowlicker brings a new feel to music, and Track 2 boggles the mind with complex feel that u cant compute, then time to relax with Nannou, the song i just cant get tired of, an unbelievable new sound, these three tracks create three different moods, so experience them all u wont be dissapointed"
3,Not bad!!,"The only worthwhile track on this cd (at least from my point of view) is windowlicker. It is very catchy, although the other 2 songs aren't as good as the first one, its still a cd to get if you're a fan of AFX!!!"
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting EP from RDJ, hard listening, and you can't dance to this. If you listen to me, you put this EP in backorder, and get Donkey Rhubarb EP."
4,Recommended,"Despite its size, this album overflows with ideas. The title track borrows themes and samples from Come To Daddy (Pappy Mix). It is enjoyable, fun and joyfully polyrythmic. The sampling of voices, resulting in a wicked choir, is original and effective. The second piece is also closer to the Come To Daddy CD than to other work of AFX, and seems quite unremarkable (to me). The third one is a little masterpiece in its simplicity: a ""canon"" of carillons indulging on a beautiful melody. Recommended without esitations."
5,A stunning video,I haven't heard the CD but I have seen the video to Windowlicker by Aphex Twin. I must say that video belongs to the strangest videos I have ever seen. The mixure of music and horror was excellent.
5,This has been an amazing read!,"This is simply the best. As it is combined with the seminar you give, ""Courageous Moms Raising Boys to Become Good Men"", this will be a world changer! I am so glad to have heard about you and your work. Thank you for the easy to read, deeply insightful book. You have given many woman hope whither they are single, married, grandma's or teachers, the insight and wisdom is refreshing! I'll be looking forward to reading your next book."
4,Interesting maybe for moms with older boys,"This book was interesting, but I found myself feeling a little overwhelmed by what is to come. I have a baby boy, and this book is definitely more focused toward young men."
3,"not that great, wont be taking this advice",Somewhat boring and personal. Alot of his advice is what he feels and thinks. It is not based off of what the Bible says 100 % of the time. Also if I would have known before hand that it is mainly written for single mothers I would not have bought the book... since I am not a single mom.
4,can't dislike EZ,the patterns in this book aren't spectacular but they are very useful and she explains how to modify them to anyone's liking. a lot of helpful tips and a funny read.
5,Truly insiprational film,"This is not a movie, it is a short documentary about the life of an elderly woman. She talks about all the ups and downs she has experienced in life. Definitely worth watching at least once because there are so many life lessons presented."
4,Brides of Dracula is a Hammer classic,"Despite the fact that ""Dracula"" doesn't actually appear in ""Brides of Dracula"", this film is still one of the best of Hammer's vampire movies.It's got everything that one falls in love with when it comes to Hammer horror: Great gothic atmosphere, wonderful period sets and costumes, and of course a great story to complement it all.The plot is fairly simple in this one: The countess has her son chained up in his bedroom. A fair maiden visiting the castle see him and unwittingly sets him loose. He wreaks havoc in the village, turning maidens into vampires. Naturally, when vampires attack Dr. Van Helsing can't be far behind-and Peter Cushing plays him to utter perfection.""Brides of Dracula"" is definitly the most unusual of the Hammer ""Dracula"" series-but it certainly stands out as one of their best. Fans of gothic horror will no doubt be pleased. END"
4,Solid piece of work,"This set has all you need from a Mancala set. The woodwork is well done with no rough edges and the hinges close tightly.. Plenty of glass beads to allow for a few lost ones. The tin outer sleeve holds the whole thing together when store.My only gripe is that, being made of tin, the outer sleeve makes a noise when carried"
5,"Lord, Be Glorified Vol. III Piano Solo Book","I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Piano Solo Book!!!! 5 STARS! Amazon is awesome to find hard to find stuff at great prices!!!"
3,"Oldie, yet could be bettah","Well what can be said about a definite formula, eh? Fresh off of the rebound of the En-Tact the Shamen hit nothing new what so ever as they try and drive into yer mind with a sunny hello (sic). Boss drum has a certain tribal flow and L.S.I. is a definate groove with a siren's call to all, to hit the floor and grind; followed up by Ebeneezer Goode's trip at 120bpm to wannabe Anthem heaven. But after that,...pffffft. nothing, no moving mountains here. Boss Drum well just doesn't come on strong at all."
3,Where's the Yo Gabba Gabba season 2 DVD?,"I don't like that this is only downloadable for the computer. My son LOVES this episode. I was even going to buy Season 2 just to ensure I got this on dvd but guess what...there is no Season 2 DVD on sale...just another downloadable thing. That stinks. By the time they come out with it, if they ever do, my son will probably outgrow it. Why is there so little yo gabba gabba stuff? I checked everywhere so it's not Amazon's fault. At least they had this to download. I have it taped on my dvr box but I really wanted it on DVD so we can play it in the car on our portable dvd player."
3,Below expectations,"I bought this CD after hearing the Ysaye Quartet in concert. They had held a very fine performance. However, I am disappointed with this CD. The recorded sound is not ideal, but much more annoying are the the 1st violin's technical problems. I do not like to wince during a performance of any music, but there were many such moments in this CD; intonation problems, muddy passages, dubious musical phrasings, and the problems start from the very beginning.Far more impressive and satisfying is the Talich Quartet recording. Also deserving of mention are the Emerson and Leipzig Quartet recordings. Just stay away from the Ysaye Quartet recording."
5,my review,"These speaker stands were perfect for my bose 201 speakers,they elevated them to ear level since i use them for my surround sound.I would recommend these stands for speakers the size of bose 201/301."
4,Good for the price,"The delivery from Amazon was excellent in just 2 days. The speaker stands look good. However, the material could be better. Assemble needs to pay extra attention. It's very easy to break it if the screw doesn't fit into the hole.Overall, it is worthy for the money."
4,Decent Speaker Stands,"These do the job, just take care when putting together. I can see why others have had problems, but if you take your time you shouldn't have a problem. The foot print is kinda big, but not a deal breaker. You don't have to use the foot pins if you have hard wood floors."
3,Best if they aren't going to be touched,"These stands look fine and more or less do what they are supposed to do. However, if you place them in a spot where they can be bumped into, the connection to the base will break. They are cheap though and look ok."
2,poor quality,"Saw reviews about not overtightening, But I put alot of things together so I figured ok no problem and so I gently tightened these and 3 of 4 pieces cracked. So I'm going to return these as though I could fix them I just don't see getting something new and having to make repairs as I'm sure if I move them around they'll just break. very disapointed in quality, I buy alot of lower end wood products and have never seen this type of problem before. Would not recommend!!"
2,"Works fine, crappy quality",Luckily I only needed one of the stands. While putting these together a few of the pieces of wood cracked and/or split when the screws went into them. Also one of the little plastic feet broke off of one of the bases.It does look very nice now though and the hidden wire feature is cool.
4,Sanus BF-31B Speaker Stands,"For the price they are worth it.I was worried about the weight of my Polk M40 bookshelf speakers (36Lbs)Ea x 4.The Sanus stands held the weight well and looked awsome with the largefull range 3 way speakers 2) 5 1/4"" subwoofers and 1) 1"" tweeters per speaker"
2,You get what you pay for....,AS mentioned early cable management is a joke. Construction is pretty cheezy. Be careful how much weight you put on these. Good for satellite speakers for surround. I was going to use these for some bookshelf speakers in my office and I'm having second thoughts because I do not want my speakers to take a nosedive.During construction I would use some glue to reinforce the screws and maybe get some wood screws which are just a little larger.If I had known these points before purchasing I would have moved on to another manufacturer. I hope that helps you and your decision.
4,Good stands for the money,"I picked up 6 of these stands for a 7.1 setup. I've got Polk audio satellites on the stands, and they fit well without any concerns. The stands have a nice appearance, and hide the speaker wire amazing well. As others have noted, the particle board is extremely thin, so you have to be very very careful during installation to avoid breaking / cracking them. I ended up with 3 hairline cracks out of 6 stands just because one of the 4 screws wasn't perfectly lined up. It's minor and not noticeable, but is worth mentioning. I can't say I'm surprised given the price."
2,Wood splits - customer service non-existent,"I experienced the same problem many others did with the legs splitting. I was careful, but they still split. I contacted the company to ask for a replacement leg. They never replied to my email.If you're going to buy a pair of these, only do it through an outlet where you can return them easily. I would have returned these to Amazon but I'd already passed my 30 day window when I decided to put them together."
3,Not high quality - but get's the job done,"The board on the stands is very easily cracked when tightening the screws - this is not a high quality stand. The holes for wiring are not useful as they get completely covered by the speakers. Also, the speakers basically sit on the stand and are not secured in any way - they can easily fall off if nudged.Gets the job done - if all you're looking for is a cheap way to get your speakers off the floor and up to ear level."
1,LOW Quality Product- Don't waste your time or $$$,This is a very low quality product. These stands are made of particle board-type wood. One of the stands was cracked upon receipt. The other cracked as soon as I started screwing it together. Do not waste your time on these. Buy something else instead.
5,Nice and easy.,The only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the cards that hide the back leaves a gap. It doesn't cover the full length.
2,Not exactly what I expected,The mascara seemed to be somewhat dry and hard to apply...did not coat the eyelashes as expected. I have to say I was disappointed in this product.
4,Entertaining,I found this movie better than I expected. Very entertaining! This is a movie you don't have to think too much about.....just let go and let yourself have a little fun for the evening.
2,coffee date,"another ""no I'm not gay even though I act it"" movie. The main character leaves you wondering, until the end when he decides once and for all that he is straight."
2,Save your money -,Santa brought two of these strollers and our daughters are not rough on toys. 2 days into owning these strollers the front wheels of both of them broke right off. They weren't even fixable. We had to take these back for a refund. Disappointed.
5,"The ""real"" deal",I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and I love it. It's the perfect size/height for her to grow with the next few years. It's extremely sturdy and the most well made doll stroller I've seen..and with 2 little girls I've seen a lot! My 2 year old has a different stroller for now (one more suited to her height and a less expensive one since I figure she'll be a little rougher yet) but I intend to buy another one of these strollers for her as well.
3,OK but not their best songs or production,Not one I would buy again. Had to replace a tape for my wife.
5,Corrección de un comentario...,"Ví que uno de los comentarios dice que no hay subtítulos en Español.¡¡Ojo!! Hay 2 versiones del DVD en venta. Yo compré aquel cuya descripción sí mencionaba los subtítulos en Español. Y, en efecto, los trae. Así que, hermanos del habla hispana, sí lo pueden ver sin problemas. Sólo chequen que en las características del producto se mencionen dichos subtítulos ;)¡Esta es una de las mejores comedias del cine soviético! ¡Un clásico!"
2,Did we see the same movie?,"Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it. No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next. If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal. Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases. I have to wonder what they could be: ""Damned Melon!"" or ""I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!""??? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether. In sum, don't waste your time."
2,Disappointment,"Aye.... no, no, no. I had great expectations from this cd. I thought that it would be as good as ""ADIEMUS"", but I was wrong. It is less lively and much less melodic. I expected choir chants and powerful medieval music, but what I got was an amorphous mixture of sounds. Do yourself a favor, buy ADIEMUS, and not DANCES OF TIME."
4,Good products with a good charger,"If you use these with a good charger like the La Crosse BD900, they are superior to any other battery I've used. Like all recharegables, they are prone to developing memory so a full discharge and a reconditioning on a good charger brings them up close to full specifications. The reviewer who went to Africa probably started with some that had a high shelf life, had developed memory and were never fully charged to capacity. If you are a high battery user don't buy a cheap charger, spend an extra $20.00 and get something good, your batteries will thank you."
3,My results did not match those of many other reviews,"After reading the glowing reviews about the batteries being precharged and ready to use out of the package, I was disappointed that I had to charge them before I could use them. I used two of the four and found the other two to be discharged when I needed to use them. I do not understand why my results were so different from so many others. Do the batteries discharge if left in the charger?"
5,Rechargeables that work,These Sanyo rechargeable batteries really work. They maintain a charge as claimed. I have had some of these for over a year and they do not seem to lose capacity like others I have tried.
4,Works fine with wireless mighty-mouse,I bought these because normal rechargeable batteries last about two days in my Macintosh mighty mouse. These batteries last about two weeks. This makes rechargeable batteries an option for my mouse.
5,Eneloop rechargeable batteries,"I ordered 5 4-packs of the Eneloop rechargeable batteries. They arrived on time and in excellent condition. I had mistakenly ordered the AAA size, when I intended to order the AA size. The vendor, Media Mart, gave me instructions to ship the AAA batteries back to them, and they promptly sent me my AA batteries. They gave me excellent service. I would recommend Media Mart to anyone."
3,not as long lasting as generic rechargeables,"I use lots of AAA rechargeables for an MP3 player, so I run a battery for an hour at a time, up to 2 hours, while working out.These have a short life , about 2-3 hours, while a generic I have lasts for e.g., 5 hours.I think the memory on these isn't so good,I don't think I would buy again."
1,poor duration between charges,"I bought a logitech wireless keyboard/mouse that included these batteries, so when the battery in the mouse would die within just a few hours I figured the battery was bad and decided to buy some replacements.I have to say I'm very disappointed with how short a time you can go between recharging it. If I would leave the mouse on for several days (even without using it) I would have to recharge it as soon as I touched it again. I just gave up and put in a standard Energizer AA in the mouse and have been happier with the duration even if I DO have to change it out from time to time.Hey at least now I just swap out the batt and remain wireless rather than having to be tethered for a couple of hours while it charges.Can't really recommend these."
5,THE BEST RECHARGABLE BATTERIES YOU WILL EVER BUY!,"I have used Eneloop Rechargable batteries since they came out. They are by far the BEST batteries you can use, PLUS they are rechargable! I received it in two days upon ordering and I recommend this to everyone who uses batteries!"
4,No complaints about the battery itself but...,"I used 4 of the Sanyo batteries immediately on my S6000fd, and it lasted for 220 shots after 2 full days of use. They can definitely claim to be ready to use out of the box. The reason for not giving the top rating is that the package Amazon sent me was already cut open at the sides. I don't know whether or not this was intentional. At least I can reuse the plastic to store the batteries when not in use."
1,worst batteries ever,When they arrived I took two out and put into my device. Within one day the charge was gone and I put them in charger. They never did fully charge but after a day I tried using them again. Same thing. The other 2 batteries had same issue. They won't last more than 1 day and they won't recharge completely. I put different rechargeable batteries in and they are still going strong after 1 month.
5,Great product,"I have been using these batteries for over a year in our kids toys (cordless game controllers, etc..) and am amazed how long they last, i'll never buy standard batteries again."
5,The Best,"Looked all over the web and these are rated the best everywhere. Got them, put all 4 in my camera and they were fully charged.2 weeks in I'm very satisfied."
5,high performers indeed,"In my Fuji Finepix S9000, these batteries have outlasted and outshot any other rechargeables I've tried. I do a lot of landscapes, waiting out in the cold for that elusive shaft of sunlight, and the Eneloops don't seem to react to low temperatures by fading quickly the way most others have. After using them for a few months and multiple recharge cycles, I'm very happy with their performance."
5,Great re-chargeable batteries,"These work great. They come pre-charged. The charge holds for a long time if you aren't using the battery, and gives lots of life when you are charging. The battery itself has a long life and will last through a lot of charges and for many years."
5,Sanyo Rechargeable Batteries,"Come fully charged, ready to go! Work like a charm! I have tried several brands of rechargeable and these have been the best. I had bought these previously and they keep their full charge for over two years! The only drawback is your ability to charge them up to the same level as they are when you receive them. All in all I believe theses are the best bang for your buck! Especially if you catch them on sale like I did!"
5,What a relief.......,"These batteries are great! Had a lot of problems with a digital camera. Got these batteries, charged them up, stuck them in and all the problems went away. Wish I would have got them when I bought the camera. Have taken scads of pictures and the batteries are still fine."
5,"nice product,small package","this product is well worth the money. any one with a digital camera should consider this. you always have a back-up set and you dont need a suitcase to carry the charger. the charger is about a half inch longer than 2 aa batteries end to end, 3/4"" thick and 4 aa batteries wide."
3,"just received it, so far looks good...","i just received the batteries with the charger model: NC-MQN06W (100-240V). it's still charging, the two green leds are flashing and i don't have any idea how to know the batteries are fully charged because the instructions that come with the charger are in spanish and portuguese ""had to copy some sentences to whatlanguageisthis.com"" to identify the 2 languages. where is english? maybe these items were not destined to usa. to be continued..."
5,Really Good Rechargables,"I have a Canon SX130Is and the battery life was not the best, after doing some research many people recommend the Sanyo Eneloop. What a difference!!! Now I can take 200+ pictures and longer videos. I'm very pleased with this product. Now I'm enjoying my camera!!!"
4,Pre-charged AA rechargable batteries,"I just received them last week, but have already noticed the improvement over the standard AA rechargeable batteries; they lost their charge in a couple of days sitting in my camera case. These don't do that; their charge is there when I need them. Would recommend them."
4,Great value,"When I priced batteries and charger separately, I had a hard time beating this combination, so I bought several. Now I can charge 12 batteries at the same time on 3 different chargers."
1,"Enelooop AA Poor Quality or ""Old Stock""?? Bad Batteries","Seller was expedient but these batteries must be old. They were dead when I received them ( I also bought the Sanyo Battery Charger) After charging, my digital camera only shot 35 pics, outdoors, no flash, and were dead. The others I used in my Wii remote and Harmony 700. The Wii lasted a couple days and the Harmony 700 lasted a wekk. Update: With standard batteries I get a couple weeks on Wii and a month on Harmony 700. Very disappointed. Update: As of Aug 12, my batteries in my camera fail to even turn the camera on after just being freshly charged. If these batteries are as good as I have seen on the net, then this stock must be very old and I would look elsewhere for these batteries."
5,the best double a batteries on the market:),these are by far the best rechargeable double a batteries made:):) the quality and value are amazing:):) I highly recommend these batteries to all:):) A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 5 STARS OUT OF 5 STARS:):):)
1,Worthless for Camera's,Out of the box they needed to recharged and would not keep a charge for more than 20 pictures with my Kodak Z812 camera.
1,What a crock!,"My old, old everready batteries just keep on truckin, recharging, giving bright lights in my booklights, and powering all my other gadgets just fine, on & on. The newer eneloops, which I bought after searching to see if I could do even better and reading all the ads and positive reviews on amazon, started fine, but have fallen below my old everreadys. I bought several different packs and both 800 and 1000's and a special super great charger which sometimes I ""must"" use for the eneloops, whereas the everreadys recharge in various chargers, etc., etc. I would NOT recommend the eneloops over just everyday everreadys for anything in my everyday experiences with all the different battery powered gadgets, clocks, remotes, CD players, etc all over the house these days!"
4,Pricey but nice,"These new eneloops are very nice for the mere fact that I don't have to worry if my rechargeables are dead or not. Wish they had a higher amp hour rating, but overall I am happy."
1,Available cheaper elsewhere on Amazon,"I have no doubt that these batteries are top-notch - after reading reviews I've ordered some eneloops for myself. But there's no obvious reason to buy this 8-pack for $61 ($50 + $11 shipping!) as of this writing, when the 4-pack is only $10 and eligible for free super-saver shipping from Amazon:GE/SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries.Updated 3/9/08: This is insane. Since my original comment, the price to purchase this set of eight batteries has been jacked up to $76.94 ($64.99 + $11.95 shipping). Meanwhile, a set of four of the same batteriesGE/SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesremains $9.76 with free super-saver shipping available."
5,Done With MAHAs!,"After a few years of buying and using MAHAs that didn't last as long as advertised, I finally decided no more having to top off the batteries first before you use 'em every time. Now I've got eneloops and there's no lookin' back. They're always ready when you are. The way it should be."
5,SANYO BATTERIES,THE BOTTOM LINE THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THEY ACTUALLY WORK AS ADVERTISED. WHEN RECHARGED THEY LAST A LONG TIME. SANYO AA BATTERIES CAN REPLACE C AND D BATTERIES WITH THE PROVIDED ADAPTERS FOR A LONG TIME. ADAPTERS CAN BE BOUGHT AS A PACKAGE WITH BATTERIES OR JUST BUY BATTERIES SEPARATELY. THE ADDITIONAL MONEY NEEDED TO BUY THEM IS EASILY RECOUPED IN A MODERATE AMOUNT OF TIME. HARD TO BELIEVE SOMETHING ACTUALLY WORKS!
5,Great Product,"I received my product sooner than expected, they were fully charged and ready to use when I received them. I will for sure purchase these again when I need new batteries!"
5,Eneloop Wins,Use these in my Pentax and the camera is always ready to shoot. No more finding out the batteries need charging at an important photo-op. Definitely worth the small extra cost.
4,What's not to like?,"Nothing's more annoying then getting your batteries home and then waiting forever for them to charge, so I appreciate that these come pre-charged. Yes, they lose a little charge as they sit on the shelf, but there's enough in there for you to use them, and if you decide to charge them it will take less time. You might consider getting a good charger, and by good I mean one that can not only charge but re-condition your rechargeable batteries. I got theLa Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Chargerand it's fantastic."
5,Well worth the purchase,Great charger and capable of doing both AA and AAA. Best brand rechargeable on the market by far. Well worth the purchase.
4,great batteries !,"I've had these eneloops a few weeks now and have been very satisfied. They last as long as a regular battery -- or at least as close to as long. They seem to take a long time to charge, but it's not a big deal if you have several batteries. The eneloops are a lot easier to recycle as well. I've had difficulty finding recycling faclilities that will take the alkaline batteries."
4,I would recommend them!,"I was a little worried when I first got them. The package says they are precharged so I put them in the flash (580 EX II) and nothing. Wouldn't even turn on. So I went ahead and charged them. Put them back in and the digital screen was flashing as though the batteries were low. Needless to say, I was a little pissed. But the next day, it worked fine and they've been great ever since. They hold a great charge. Did an entire wedding on one set. I gave it a 4 out of 5 b/c of the problems when I first got them."
5,Good batteries,"One thing I noticed right away is that these batteries are heavier then the cheap ones that came with my solar lights. I have not weighed them and compared, but these new ones feel like they may be twice as heavy.They definitely work as replacement batteries for my solar decorations and lights in the yard. Some of my lights were getting dim or not coming on. I replaced the batteries with these and they started working again. Now they hold a charge longer then the others do. Guess I'll be replacing all of them soon.Good product!"
5,Superb Batteries,"What can I say, these batteries are fantastic. Charge them, then forget about them. Whenever you need them, they'll still be charged, even months later. I use them mostly for my game systems, but due to their low discharge rate you could literally use them in anything, even devices you rarely ever use.Get yourself a good smart charger and you will be set."
5,Working great in my Harmony Remote,"I've used these batteries in my Harmony universal remote for the past year and they do their job. The remote lights up and has a small display screen, but it is still just a remote and doesn't use batteries too fast. I've only had to charge the batteries a couple of times in the past year (literally only twice I think) so they last long for my use."
3,"Batteries great, charger broke in Europe","The batteries really do hold their power for a long time, and rarely need recharging. My camera has signifcant zoom and video capabilities, and that can drain them a little more quickly (especially the video).The charger did not work in Europe in my converter, although my cellphone & laptop had no problems. I bought a European charger, and the batteries took that charge just fine. Now back in the US, the original charger doesnt work at all. It had worked fine in the US before the trip.When I bought this, I thought it came with an adapter or was ""universal"". It did not, and it is not. So if you travel outside the US, be prepared to get another charger.Hope this helps!"
4,Charging,When I first charged first pair of eneloop batteries an automatic green blinking light went on. It seemed like it continued for awhile so I unplugged it in fear of overcharging. How do I know when charging is complete? Please advise.Thank you
4,Why use any other type of battery,Charge them up and forget about them. They hold their charge for a long time so you can keep them hanging around until you are ready or put them in devices that don't get used very often or use very much energy.
5,Best rechargables,"I have a radio which runs on three AA batteries. With NiCDs and NiMHs I kept a log of recharge cycles. After ten recharges, it was time to replace the cells. I quit counting the eneloop recharges after twenty.I finally replaced the two sets after three or four years of daily use. Try that with other rechargables!The original cells were a tight fit in my radio. I read a Sanyo FAQ which said that the dimensions were within AA standards. The new set is much easier to remove, so they must have thinned the plastic cover a bit.If you need rechargable AA batteries, these are the ones to get."
1,Bad supplier. Sold me used baterries,"I cant comment on the quality of the eneloop itself because i was duped into receiving used batteries. They dint come in any original pack from manufacturer, looked beatean down with bit of rust on the edges.Once i fully charge them the battery gets discharges in minutes, hardly any juice left. Really a bad experience buying this product from this supplier"
5,eneloop is great!,"These eneloop batteries are amazing! I use them in all of my kids' toys...they're ready to use, they hold their charge for over a year, and there's PLENTY of power to power any toy or digital camera! The point of the battery is that it's ready to use, and holds its charge...and they live up to that claim! Sanyo is still the battery leader!"
1,Seller discontinued the order and never even let me know!!!,"The seller put these items up for sale, i bought them - received the order placement email but then never received anything further - a few weeks later I inquired because I hadn't received my batteries and i found out that the seller had cancelled the order because they had run out. and then never even bothered to inform me. Horrendous doing business with this seller."
1,Disapointment with the buying process,I was shopping and mistakenly placed my order? I was able to cancel one of two items immediately. Have no option to cancel the other. I'm very disapointed with the whole process. I certainly will think twice before using Amazon again going foward.
1,Looks to be fake sanyo batteries,The packaging is totally different then the one it shows on the ad.I have never seen this type of packaging in stores for these type of batteries ever!I think these are fake Chinese copy's .These look so fake.
4,So far so good,I bought energizer rechargables at lowes only to find some stoped working after a while. These do seeme to hold a charge pretty good and they have held up pretty good.
4,Great Movie!!!,"I loved it!!! If this film maker has any other films, I'd like to know what they are so that I can see more of his work."
1,A complete waist of money!!!,"I have bought this chart to measure my daughter's annual growth. The design of this product is cute however the three panels are very flimsy. The panels are held together with a fabric tape which add several inches to the overall length of this chart but the measuring system on the chart doesn't reflect this ( the distance between inch 36 and 37 is an inch and a half). Therefore, I had to measure my daughter and then manually enter it on the chart. Not much of a growing chart to me. The stickers included to record Birthdays and Special Occasions are small and melt together with the background color/design, therefore are really hard to spot.A complete waist of money!!!"
2,Cynicism. No thanks!,"I read this book for a class in Communication Theory and Criticism. The book was so cynical of what media is really about, it made me question at time why I should even become a journalist, if corporate America has such a hold over all forms of media."
4,duo charlie Hunter,Chatlie Hunter's cd's are amazing---I found this cd to be more raw and simplistic than his other cd's yet a must for anyone desiring to explore the genius of mr. Hunter.Anthony hanley
2,Time-Killer -,"""Up in the Air"" is primarily a long advertisement for American Airlines, Hertz Rent-A-Car, and Hilton Hotels. It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' ""Go To Meeting"" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!"
1,No More 24-Hour Rentals,"Great movie, but the 24-hour viewing window is absurd. I'm done with accepting that ridiculous condition. Never again. Makes me sympathetic to piracy - is stealing from pirates wrong?"
4,Very Entertaining,"I thought this movie was very entertaining and also took a very real look at several modern life issues. Just like real life the ending is not a fairy tale, but is somewhat satisfying in its own ways.Like many of us in real life the main character goes through a series life altering events only to circle back around to where we started, but hopefully a better personDefinitely worth a watch, at least a rental."
3,Worth a watch.,"Good movie - watchable, I was never bored, good performances from the leads, nice bit of a twist at the end. Not something I feel the burning need to purchase or re-watch over and over but very worth the price of a rental."
1,"Ironically, watched it on a plane flight. Worst movie ever.",Must have taken all of two full days to film this vapid made-for-TV episode of life by plane travel. Most boring movie ever made.
4,"good, not great, story of alienation and connection","This was a pretty good if not great story of a business traveler who spends almost all of his time on a plane--that is, when he isn't firing people or training others in how to do the same. The film explores the lack of connection and empathy on his part in regard to the horrible job he has, and how others can spend time with family while he has almost no one to spend time with except on a temporary basis.I'm not sure why this had so many nominations. It's solid work from Clooney but certainly not his best role by any means. His role in O Brother, Where Art Thou? was much stronger and more substantial."
2,Another Hollywood DUD,"What is with the adoration for this movie. Stupid premise (are there really companies who are contracted out to fire employees of other companies - I doubt it), and a plodding plot line that made no sense in the end. And Clooney was better in other movies, including Burn After Reading. I only gave it two stars because somehow I made it to the ambiguous ending. (Serious Man I turned off after ten minutes)."
3,Up in the Air,Not a George Clooney fan. I bought it for my husband. I made it through 2/3 of the movie and just quit watching it. There is nothing good or funny about people all over the world losing their jobs.
3,Blu-Ray BUYER BEWARE,"I just received this dvd and was looking forward to watching it. Actually I had just ordered 5 blu-ray discs from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when none of them would play in my blu-ray player. There was a disclaimer with the disc that it was recorded in the highest possible fashion and might not be rendered as well in an older player (mine is 2 years old), but nothing to the fact that it would NOT play at all. Also, the trouble web site displayed is nonexistent. Although this is not Amazon's fault, I wanted to warn other blu-ray buyers. I think this is a lousy way for Sony to treat customers who have previously bought blu-ray products. I've been a Sony purchaser for over 30 years, but they just lost a consumer."
3,Up in the Air - 3 Stars,"This movie has great previews and promised more or I have expected more. It was not disappointing, however, could have been little better for my taste. There are correspondingly really good things about this movie. It's not a must watch, yet it might be appealing to some of you. I give it anywhere between 3 - 3.5 stars. :)"
3,Big Brain Academy,This is along the lines of Brain Games one and two. It's a little more childish though. They need to come up with more games to keep the adults who came to this platform to play the Brain Games. This isn't quite the thing I was looking for.
3,it's good training for the mind....,If you don't wanna waste your time just playing games... this is not only a game it also keeps your brain thinking!!!!
2,Slang,Not a great discription of the game and the records should have been cleared off. A gamer saved on there was slang and was disappointed to see this as my young son was playing.
1,boring,This game is very limited. Once you've gone through the sequences there's nothing left. No wonder it's so cheap.
2,Did not last,"I have now had this pan for about one year. At first I simply loved it but it must be used at very, very low heat or the coating just flakes right off."
3,Anolon Open Round Griddle Pan,I was attempting to replace an older version of the same pan by purchasing this one. When it arrived I realized my mistake in that it is not what I had before. This is the typical non stick pan with restrictions as to what utensils one can use to manipulate the items being processed. My other pan was anodized rather than the traditional non stick surface. My mistake and a costly one. I have basically thrown out all such non stick pans as the slightest scratch begins to destroy the non stick properties.
3,Teen angst makes for an okay book,"The book was billed sort of as a book for lesbian teen girls... or rather I got that impression. Standard paperback size. It was entertaining to read. The emotional manipulation that totally screwed the main character over was wow. Yeah. Wow. In man, girls/women can be mean and destructive to their own kind. Not that I don't know this but yeah. Wow. Still a decent read. I probably won't reread it. Teen angst of the sort that goes on feels a bit beyond me but still a good read."
1,[Knock off],"Very poor sound quality, sounds like old kerokee songs, one worst than the other... the video quality and production is a joke ..."
1,Bad product,"Owned it for a few months. Suction cupped it to my car dashboard. Didn't keep the PSP very sturdy, as it vibrated constantly and I have a brand new Civic which is a smooth ride. Eventually, the hinges came loose after about 3 months."
4,Opened my eyes to a new viable treatment modality,"I read this book quickly. It covers ""Voice Dialog"", a treatment modality that looks very promising in uncovering your hidden/unconscius motivations by way of your speaking from the perspective of your various inner voices (perfectionist, critic, inner child, etc.) I'm definitely over-simplifying here. I know a lot about psychology, really liked it, and definitely recommend as an informative read that may inspire hope in those who have spent a lot of time in other modalities without satisfactory results."
2,Dragging rubbing sound from tray,"The Sherwood had a good sound, the only problems were (1)the remote unable to open and close tray and unable to move from disc to disc to remove from tray.(2)the tray was slow moving and had a dragging rubbing sound."
4,Good Unit--But throw away the manual.,Unit works well. Sound output is very good & change mechanism is smooth. Setup & operation is easy & intuitive. Good thing because the manual sucks!
3,Boring!!!!!!,Paul Fleischman why did you write this book ! It needs action in it.I haven't read the the hole thing but it is all ready noninserthing .Paul I like your book but next time put more action In it.I will not put this in my reading page .
2,Seedfolks,"This book tries too hard to be meaningful, diverse, and deep. If Fleishman hadn't put so much emphasis on it, the book would have been much better."
5,What a great lesson in grassroots work!,"I loved this book. I am really upset I didn't buy 25 copies for my 6th grade classroom when I had the chance. The book is divided into chapters, where each chapter stands alone, but adds to the whole book. The image it brings to mind is that of a quilt, where each piece is interesting alone, but together make an even better impression. I think it would be a great book to talk about and spring board into the topics of multicultural heritage, farming, plants, science, grassroots movement, community. I highly reccomend this book!"
4,SeedfolksReview,"Every time I think of Seedfolk by Paul Fleishman, I reminisce on the beautiful text, metaphorsand the inspirational plot! Even though it wasn't the best book I've ever read, It was still verycaptivating. This book is about a neighborhood in Cleveland , Ohio, were an old vacant lot turnedinto a unexpected garden, knitting together a truckload of hopes and dreams. My favorite characterwas Kim because by 1 simple act, she started the garden and led way for everyone else. I like thisbook because everyone was the main character, and everyone story fits together like a jigsaw puzzle.I really recommend this book if you like short stories!-ZC"
5,PERFECT TRAVEL MUG,This travel mug was a gift for my husband who likes to drink his coffee in the car on the way to work. He loves the 20 oz. size since most other coffee mugs tend to be smaller. It alsokeeps the coffee hot for a long time and fits nicely in the car's cupholder. The handle is easy to grip and the top opens easily to sip the coffee. It's very well made.
2,"Useless, it leaks all over the place","Just as other reviewers have said, this cup leaked from the first time i used it. The lid is sealed with 2 rubber rings that are supposed to form seal, but my hot coffee slipped right through onto my shirt multiple times. I give it 2 stars because it is one of only a few 20oz mugs and i like my large coffees from Starbucks, but I'll have to find a different solution."
3,"It's ok, but arrived broken","I bought this as a gift, and it arrived on time, but broken. They did replace it, but it took a long time, and it was awkward because it was a present."
2,Spills Galore!,"Ok guys, here's the scoop on this item.Pros:1) Yes - It does fit in the cup holder.2) Yes - It keeps the liquid warm for a good while - a couple of hours at least.Cons (A Biggie):1) The lid is useless. It just settles inside the rim of the cup. You don't even have to drop the cup for the lid to fail. Even a sturdy pothole sent coffee flying everywhere in my car.Conclusion:I don't recommend that you purchase this cup. It's pretty expensive, even without factoring in that doesn't really work."
2,"beautifully shot, poorly acted, terrible dialouge","i really like the aesthetic of this film, but not much else. the dialogue in particular is really trite. the characters are all hackneyed caricatures - john lurie as an unconvincing pimp, tom waits as a burnt-out DJ, and roberto benigni as a crazy italian guy. i didn't believe these might be real people for one second - they are very clearly ""characters"". the film is beautifully shot in black and white, but jarmusch leaves out a few things that would make this film more convincing. waits and lurie meet in prison after each was set-up for different crimes, but the film never delves into why they were set-up. we see very little of the prison aside from their cell. we don't see the escape until they're in the tunnel. we never see any police or dogs, we just hear them. the coming together of nicoletta and roberta is ridiculous.2 stars for the cinematography, 0 for everything else."
5,"After Katrina, the memory of a once-existing city","No doubt all the wood frame structures that exist in the floodedresidential streets of New Orleans will be bulldozed over. The scenes in the first 20 minutes of this motion picture depicts some of the gritty residential streets of the city. Now just a memory. With the scenes shown on television of the aftermath of hurricane Katrina to a world-view audience, what came to mind were the characters depicted in the introductory sequences of ""Down By Law"". With all the radio stations and TV stations broadcasting salutatory programs with references to the city's rich musical and historical legacy, I wondered if there was going to be a TV station that was going to have the courage to broadcast this motion picture. But alas, no, it didn't happen. Too bad. It should have."
3,Drum less than advertised,"I had the same experience as others. Prints fine but the toner cartridges don't last as long as promised, and because this was used only for a Friends meeting newsletter we kept a fairly exact page count and the drum only lasted for 12,000 pages , which is 13,000 short of the advertised 25,000. The drum costs between $160 and $170, which is as much as many printers. I did my homework and the reviews were good but I feel disappointed."
1,Money pit of a printer,"The initial price looks good, and when you look up the price of toner cartridges, they look good. What they don't tell you up front is that in addition to the toner cartridges, the print drum cartridge is a separate disposable item, and it costs nearly as much as the printer. Toner cartridges came in two loads. The larger toner cartridge was supposed to go 6000 pages. We were lucky to get 3000. The drum cartridge was supposed to go for 25,000 pages. ""It"" wanted a new one after every other toner. We donated the printer to Good Will, though I'm not sure there was much good will in that donation. We replaced it with the HP2015dn; so far, it seems to be delivering as promised, and is not eating out of house and home."
4,Works well,"For the price, this unit is well worth it. Installation was not difficult. I like the fact that no water needs to be turned off when replacing the filter. When the filter is unscrewed the water is automatically shut down. I only 2 criticisms. The faucet is a bit light on durability so if you have kids in the family this may not work out for you and filters are hard to find and the usual department stores. Otherwise it works very well."
3,"Tastes good, but leaves behind mineral deposits","We've had this product installed and working for about 2 months now. We drink alot of hot coffee, tea.. so we're always boiling the water. For the first 2 weeks it was great, when we boiled the water, it never left any trace of minerals in our pot. However, for some reason, after the 2 weeks, it started to leave a white mineral deposit on the bottom of the pot that I was using to boil the filtered water. Which makes me wonder how well the Culligan is actually filtering things out......"
5,Lisle Spark Tester,"I purchase this item to test my firing on my plug wires and it works great and of high quality, Shipping was fast, packing was great, thanks........"
2,Cheap junk.,"It barely worked. Finding the sweet spot on any wire for this thing to work was difficult. Even testing it on coils that I knew were perfectly good, I could only get it to light up occasionally."
5,"nice,simple secure",Not much to it but secure & well worth the +/- $ 10.00.Bought 3 probably buy 3 more-cheaper that the platform alone for most .
4,As described,"No issues, I use this on top of my mono pod. Makes it easy when I wish to shoot with just the hands."
2,Impossible,"I ordered this product in hopes that it would replace my lost quick-release plate for my tripod. The packaging says it fits all tripods, but not mine. In order to use the plate, you must replace your entire tripod head. By the time you figure in shipping, I recommend you just get a new tripod."
3,Workable alternative to using the screw,"If you really do a lot of swapping on and off the tripod, this is handy. From a quality standpoint, it's very good. However, the design lends itself to being substantially less than rock solid."
5,Works like a champ!,I bought this to use on a tripod that I found for free that was missing it's own quick release portion. Bolted it on and it's like a new tripod to me! Made of plastic. I use both a Vado HD pocket camera as well as my Canon 7D on it and it holds both well.
5,Sublime and haunting,"Just got this one on DVD (had the VHS copy) and have fallen in love with the film all over again. Without a doubt, this is Nicole Kidman's finest performance. Jane Campion's direction is fascinating. The opening sequence (set in modern day) of all the women talking about being kissed and the haunting score give me chills everytime I watch it. Barbara Hershey is brilliant as the devious Madame Merle. Seeing this in widescreen format with the digital sound is amazing. A must have for any DVD collection."
2,A tragedy of a film,"I found the novel a pleasure to read, but a tragedy to see end. I found this film a tragedy to watch and a pleasure to see end. Too many really important details left out leaves us to wonder what these characters are really all about. Kidman is called ""clever"" and ""headstrong"" but hardly shows it in her actions. Malkovich reprises his ""Dangerous Liasons"" character to the point of stereotyping himself. And Viggo Mortensen is much too handsome to play the American blockhead. Very hard to believe any of these people. Read the novel."
2,What Have They Done to My Song Ma?,"Splendiferous photography and state-of-the-art talent are throroughly wasted in this pretentious and often head-numbingly unexciting yet tediously overwrought rendition of a challenging novel. Did you like the first sentence of this review? If so, maybe YOU will like this movie. I was eager to see this film from the moment it came out. But this mauling of the James story was so dull that I was barely able to finish watching it. I just kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. Sometimes slow is good. But not in this case. Campion is too interested in creating a directorial aura to care about telling a story in an interesting manner."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this bike for my 12 year old grandson as a Christmas gift. Of course he didn't get much use out of it in the dead of winter. Then he moved and we forgot to load the bike. This means he only had use of it from August to October of last year and April to June of this year before it completely fell apart. The neck broke. It's a mountain bike, for goodness sake. I am just glad he wasn't on a trail. I have had Mongoose bikes before, so I know this isan aberration. The price was very resonable. Now I know why. Disappointing."
2,Works I Guess,"This does pump and complete the task for which it's designed. Problem is that it is a PITA to use, clean and stoor. With heavy batteries (D size), it won't stand on it's own and has no hook or hole for hanging it. After you pump the oil you have the choice between a tedious cleaning process or a dirty and contaminated hose for next time.I returned this and show more love to my funnel.In speaking with a King Kooker rep on another issue, the CSR also indicated that even though she received this for free, she doesn't use it. That should tell you everything you need to know."
4,a communion with self relavence,"this is a humorous rant on self relavence laced with good ole boreal melancholy. mr. johnson drags his self through the sewers of time lapsed and into the future, eventually loosing his bitterness and taking the high road....a great close up view of the ups and downs of academia!"
1,"Basicaly, the book taught nothing, and it sucked.","This book did not use any good mechanics, and gave an exceedingly difficult pace to keep up with, thus, making for poor grades."
2,Tripod screw doesn't fit some cameras,I attempted to use this for the JVC Everio GZ-HD7 camera. It didn't work. I couldn't screw it on because the tripod screw was too small. So please be forewarned all HD7 users.
2,not very useful really,This is kind of boring and really didn't help much. Listened once only. John Bradshaw's books are much more helpful with many issues.
5,"Joy Castro's ""truth book"" accesses deep, universal truths in readers","I usually only believe half of what I read on the backcover of books, but in this case the pre-reviewers of Joy Castro's Truth Book are absolutely correct! This ""heart-aching,"" chillingly honest, and elegantly-written story of triumph over childhood abuse and a beloved father's death, written in ""an achingly beautiful voice,"" is indeed ""both redemptive and hopeful,"" ""straight and true,"" and ""unflinching and unforgettable,"" as backcover writers attest. For anyone who has suffered family abuse and sadnesses, or the unexpected death of a loved one, Castro's memoir takes readers into deeper, universal truths of the human drive to know and the capacity to survive unimaginable tragedy with dignity. I could not put it down."
4,DVD for US release not the same as the original version?,"I enjoyed the film when I saw it in German. That was years ago, so it is with some hesitancy that I write the following: I think some scenes (such as one where the female lead places an insect on her lover's chest) were cut from the film for US release. I cannot be sure because I do not have a German release with which to compare the films. If anyone can say more, please say so in comments to this review--especially if I'm remembering a different film!"
5,wholesome enjoyment and good example of family problems,"Many R-rated films have diturbing scenes and vulgar language mixed in with a good plot. This has neither. There is one scene with her boyfriend where you want to send the children out of the room,but the rest is very good. It shows family struggles that are familiar to us all. Pround Grandparents, flighty aunt, parents who dont understand the childs interest in music. It has a slow pace but the characters develop realistically. This movie also deals with the not so common problem, the relationships between deaf and hearing people. I would recommend this film to anyone who doesnt get upset by the one scene."
5,Great representation,i was a deaf education major in college and can safely say that this is the best representation i have ever seen of the deaf community. it is an excellent movie and i HIGHLY recommend it.
4,very amateur historian's view,nearly all of the historical facts noted in the novel were correct and the embelishments plausible. easy to read and enjoyable. I did learn much about Mrs. Lincoln's life.
1,Very boring and disappointing book,"I expected an interesting novel based on the life of MTL, given the reviews about the book and the author on the book jacket.This book is boring and really only covers her ""pathology."" If you know the basic outline of her life, you won't gain anything by reading the book. The book truly lacks content and context. I've read a number of biographies about MTL, and she was an interesting woman. You'd never know it from reading this book. The author portrays her as a pitiful, lifelong ""victim"" of the people around her. MTL deserves better than this thin, fluffy novel."
5,"The Gretchens are young, fast and scientific!!!","I can appreciate a band that stays true to a certain genre, without trying too hard to be something they are not. I especially enjoyed the hot guitar licks and the drummer's sexy vocals.The Gretchens are definitely ""The Next Big Thing.""Too bad most of the Ramones died before they had an opportunity to hear this album obviously inspired by them."
3,Mixed review,"I bought this watch for my daughter (who is pleased with it), having bought the same one in red and black for my 10 year old son. The lavender band is more a pale pink and has discoloured to a grubby unpleasant colour in only 2 months. Apart from that it is fine.The red and black model has held its colour very well but the glass over the face is not as resilient as it might be for a 10 year old boy and is very badly scratched after 6 months of daily use. We are happy with the watches over all but they are perhaps not quite as ""tough"" and child resistant as I had hoped."
2,Deceptive Title,"The book has some very good advice and tips regarding dollhouses. However, contrary to its title, this advice pertains almost exclusively to building a new dollhouse, not with remodeling or expanding an existing one. If it had been called ""Choosing and Building a Dollhouse,"" I would have given it a higher rating, but I was extremely disappointed to find that it could shed no light on my own issues of remodeling an existing dollhouse."
3,Wee Wee Pads,I purchased these wee wee pads to use for my small dog.These are a large size as stated but extremely thin. They don't seem to be leaking through and although they are thin my dog seems to like them and does her business on them with no problem.I will most likely not reorder however I will finish out what I have already purchased.
4,For lovers of electro/industrial,"Afi's Davey Havok and Jade Pugent have come together to make this fabulous electronic album that emcompasses both their strong points, Daveys vocals and jades art of writing and mad beats! Has a certain 80's feel to it in some places."
5,The bible of investing,This is still the best book ever written about investing in the stock market. Long but very good.
5,Security Analysis 1940 edition,"If you have read The Intelligent Investor, and want a text that will expand and delve deeper into fundamental analysis, this book is for you. The separation between this book, and books similar in content, is the fact that Graham shows examples of his applied techniques. The book is broken down into two main sections, fixed value investments(bonds, preferred stocks, ect.) and common stock analysis/selection. He takes you step by step through income statement and balance sheet analysis. Graham is wary of coporate reports, especially when it comes to earnings, and points out coporate trickery to watch out for and avoid. The topics are detailed, and the exaples extensively researched. Overall, Security Analysis is a mixture of art and scienece that lays a timeless foundation for financial analysis."
5,Sing it Britney One more time...,"THIS SONG IS DA BOMB!!!! ""Baby one more time"" is fun to sing along to and it's very catchy. it has to be one of my favorite songs! Keep up the good work Britney! ;-)"
5,This song is A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved it. The lyrcs are cool. And the flow of the song is the best!! Britney will go far!! I can't wait for her next album!!
5,...Baby one more time is a great song,"Britney is extremely talented and deserves the success she is getting. What a voice! This girl is set to go far. ...Baby one more time , is a EXCELLENT song. Go Britney!"
5,Britney Rules!,I think Britney is a beuitiful person and a great singer.I love the song ...baby one more time. i always listen to that sogn whenever i can!SHE ROCKS!!!!!
3,not so bad but...,"There are only 2 REALLY god songs in this album. But these 2 were SO good, that they were constantly on my lips, ever since I heard them. The 2 songs I'm referring to sre 'Baby one more time' & '(You drive me) Crazy'. These 2 songs are really good. They have a god beat & her voice really blends with the beat. The other songs were rather too slow for me. 'Soda pop' was ok, though u ppl out there must think me crazy. I read a dozen reviews saying ""Soda pop? I wonder how the album sold 12 million copies with THAT song!"" ""Born to make u happy' was nice. These are the only bearable songs in the whole album. But on the whole, I must say Britney has been doing well for herself with 'baby 1 mor time' &'oops.. I did it again!'"
5,A NEW BRIGHT NEW STAR!,"The way talented Britney Spears makes her recording debut with ""Baby One More Time"" and proves to be more than just another singer. She's a PERFORMER with style. Check her out in concert with N'SYNC in November.Lindzi's Page of Insanity wishes Britney the best of luck and looks forward to her entire CD's release."
4,Great sharpener,"I really like this tool. If you are able to hold the knife at a consistent angle, you can shape the edge to the angle you desire."
2,Not all that great,"I have read every book published by Robert Ludlum, and I must say that this is quite a step down from even the weakest of his novels. I can only assume that the publishers got hold of a first draft and edited it for publication because that is exactly how it reads. I would like to think that Ludlum would never have submited this for publication as is. Perhaps a few re-writes later and this would have been a good novel. As it is, I find it rather obvious and not all that well written."
3,Just not good enough,"It was my first Ludlum book. Well, I can't say it is VERY good, but in same time, it is not SO bad. Probably, 3 stars would be quite right. In some times I was caught deep enough to read without stop for a few hours, but some places look too long and boring for me. I don't like people who betray they own country, who push it into the war, into the pain and death, even if it looks like ""proper behavior"" for someone...Treachery will remain treachery forever... For me at least."
4,Another good Ludlum read,"This is another in the long list of Ludlum books I have read and enjoyed. If you like Ludlum books, this one is a bit slower than The Prometheus Deception and The Chancellor Manuscript, but the plot and subplots still captivate your interest through to the end."
1,Beware - Do not buy as gift; no box,"I bought this as a gift, and it did not come it a box. Just the the styrofoam protection, but not the actual box."
2,Unrealistic Hollywood-type hype,"This DVD makes climbing Kili look like a hike in the park, and those who think it is, should try summitting via Arrow Glacier. It does have beautiful scenic shots, though."
2,movie review on Albert Nobbs,"A waste of time and money. No amount of good acting can make up for a crap story. Pure waste of my time. I am forgetting it as fast as I can, someone pass the brain-bleach"
4,Very well done.,"A woman works at a hotel and has been living as a man for most of her life. She dreams of one day owning her own business. She comes across another woman living such a life, and also goes about courting a lady that she works with. This is a charming film that depicts the difficulty of a double life and achieving your dreams. Glenn Close is quite convincing as a woman passing herself off as a man and the performances of all the players are outstanding. The Albert Nobbs character is very likeable and I found myself hoping for something positive to come out of the man's/woman's experience. The film is never slow, and every aspect of the movie is very well done. This is a good one to see."
5,Beautiful,"Glenn Close is beyond brilliant and Janet McTeer is no slouch either. This incredibly touching movie is for viewers who appreciate quiet and subtle stories about unconventional characters. Albert is an endearingly odd and heart-wrenchingly vulnerable character who, devoid of self-pity, bravely strives to realize humble dreams in a world filled with unjust obstacles and treachery. The intelligent script is uncommonly mature and daring, the score by composer Brian Byrne is gorgeous and the period settings, furnishings, costumes, etc. are lovely. I'm especially pleased with the dvd's set of extras, which includes an audio commentary by (producer, co-screenwriter, star) Close and director Rodrigo Garcia."
4,Useful,"If you back up files on CD-R/RW, these are great. I don't personally carry 200 music CD's around with me, but when buying CD's for data storage it's always a pain to have to buy jewel cases as well. This book eliminates that problem; very handy, if slightly overpriced."
4,My six-year old loves it but can't understand it,"Cheap and richly adorned, this game takes some skill to play. My young daughter finds it fascinating; she likes it mostly because she unknowingly gets creamed by the computer-managed opponent. That is, she thinks the computer is managing her team; a 21-0 loss is a 21-0 win for her.I am only a slightly better player and much better at realizing just how poorly I am doing. The options are plentiful, from choices among exotic and attractive ball fields (boy, I should have been so lucky as a kid), line ups (as a kid, fielding a full team in the backyard would constitute a once-in-kid's lifetime dream), to pitch selection (for me as a kid it was simply throw hard, harder or harder still).Not for the impatient or the slow-witted. But this is baseball."
5,The great backyard baseball game,"The backyard baseball computer game by Humongous Entertainmentis a great game that enables children(and parents!)to play along with baseball.You can choose from any major leage baseball team. You can pick baseball players...as kids! You can also decide to choose a few made up kids from the bench or use both! next,on comes the game. There are two anouncers that tell you if there is a ball, strike, foul, steal, run, or homerun. You can also decide your roster.Play ball! You can play safely on the internet against friends ,play a single game, or create a coach and play a whole season. Have fun!!!!"
3,Death by Hollywood,"I thought that DEATH BY HOLLYWOOD was mediocre and it moved very quickly, so quick in fact that I didn't even realize when I was done.Written in first person, DEATH BY HOLLYWOOD speaks heavily about the ""glamourous"" life of Hollywood actors, screenwriters, and their agents. We follow Bobby, a writer who is down on his luck. He catches his wife in action cheating on him, his agent fires him, and he witnesses a murder all in the same day.He uses this murder to his advantage in hopes that he can make it into a killer screenplay. From then he plots himself into his own misfortune.Although this wasn't one of the best books I've read, the twists and surprises the book took on at the end really had me going. And for that I give it 3 stars."
2,Death By Hollywood,"I can't understand how the editors let this be published without someone reading through it first. What is with all the parentheses and added on little phrases everyother sentence.Is Bochco trying to be Harold Robbins of the 21st century? I read four chapters and was wondering if all the language and sex went anywhere but dead??? The sex is just there, as foul language, it doesn't add anything to the story line and as whitty as Mr. Bochco tries to be with these characters, they just don't go anywhere! I love his TV. work but this is a novel, not a screenplay. Unfortunatly, it reads like a screenplay without the ""enter stage left"". Didn't like this book at all. Sorry"
1,What a waste of paper and ink,I have read sixth-grade English Composition papers that were far superior to this.
3,awful,i would not rec. to anyone. it read as if it wae first book!!!!!!!!!! it bounced around too much. iknes the detective would kill him.
1,Too Advanced for most,This is so rigorous it is only for the advanced mathematician. I was looking for something much more accessible. I'll have to keep looking.
4,A Entertaining History Lesson,"I have never given a book a 5 star but this one was close. I wasn't sure what I liked more the entertainment value or the historical ""truth"". As I looked into some of this authors claims I learned a lot of information school didn't teach. Thanks for the inspiration!"
5,Great book!,"Just what we need as a complimentary for our ""read through the Bible in a year"" program this year. Thank you!"
5,Nothing short of Amazing!,"All that I can say for this book is wow! I have been reading Anne Rice books for some time, and I ran into this book. It took me no time to buy this book without even really knowing what it's about. I am so happy that I bought this book! I have read many books, but I have never been so excited about a book that I actually go back and read it again after I'm done. Once you enter D.N. Simmons world you'll never want to leave. Sure, there are a few errors, but if you focus on that instead of the incredible story you have truly missed out on a revoultion of vampire stories. Forgive the mistakes because despite what people think of authors, they are human. If you look past the mistakes and see the art at hand, you'll be happy that you did. This is the greatest story that I have ever read period, and I am so excited for the other books by this up and coming legend, D.N. Simmons!"
2,"Nice but,","I like the shoe, nice look and feel.But,First it scuffs easy and for some reason is a white underneath the brown, which obviously shows up.Second, the biggest part is the orange pad on the bottom will start peeling off the very first day. I meen BAD. terrible, terrible way to attach the sole pad. anyways, if you can not scuff them and superglue the bottom, then you may like. I would never buy anything from this maker again though."
4,A good one,"this is a good one, nothing less or more than expected. though to my opinion, ''bravo'' cafe is slightly better."
4,Best WWF/WWE Event So Far,"This event was great even though due to time restraints they cut out the Undertaker & Bret Hart WWF Title match, but it sucked anyway and ended in a DQ. This was the only UK event I know of where a Title actually changed hands. This will be forever remembered as the night HHH/HBK/Chyna formed DX to comete with the WCW's NWO.Here are the matches:1.)Dude Love vs. HHHgood match with the crowd really in it 4/52.)WWF Tag Title MatchHeadbangers vs. Los BaricuasNice match headbangers sucessfully defended their titles 4/53.)Legion of Doom vs. The godwinnsthe L.o.D. are great and they showed it but not in the greatest match 3/54.)Vader vs. OwenThis match was great owen proved that he could go with big men although he eventually lost.5.)WWF European ChampionshipShawn Michaels vs. British BulldogBulldog comes home to the UK to defend his title but loses it in an amazing match. DX was formed at the end of this match."
4,Blitz and friends,"This is a must for any heavy metal fan,it's just amazing .It's like being front row there ,the concert section with terrific sound ,performance and every song you could ask for(exception of Thanx for nothing).Personally I love over kill's old songs better and they sound alot better then the newer ones live.The second disc is a bonus , a in depth history about the band.They should have put some more clips on it ,so it didn't seem to run so long ."
5,killer show,i have only one thing to say if you like overkill buy this dvd and the live cd also it is the best metal release in a long time this dvd covers there whole career there are songs that are played from every album in the bands history buy it pop it in and crank it up 2 hours of ... kicking overkill!!!
1,I was in this cult for six years,"Please understand that Victor Paul Wierwille is one of the great cult leaders of all time. I was in this cult for six years, I took his ""Power For Abundant Living"" or PFAL course and his next course -- but thanks be to God stopped at that point. This is an anti-Christian, anti-Trinitarian organization that calls itself the only organization with the ""true"" teachings of the Bible. All Christian cults say this to include The Mormons, the Jehovah's Witnesses and other Christian cults. When ANY organization says it contains the ""only"" true teachings direct from God, BEWARE. ...It will change your life alright -- but it would be for the WORSE. Do not let this slick con artist -- Wierwille -- (who is now deceased) fool you into thinking his way is the ""only"" way -- it is not. There are numerous other legitimate Christian organizations that can lead you to a better knowledge of the Bible. Do not let this man's writing fool you."
