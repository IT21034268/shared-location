1,Not same product,This is just the nail strengthener Not the start to finish strengthener as shown. And it chips. :(
4,Somerthing Different,"Night Watch was gritty, dark, compelling, complex, and a taste of something different from Russia. The special effects were not over the top, but were tastefully done. At first the plot seemed a little disjointed but after a while it became clear that was intentional and the story comes together at the end. It left me wanting more, but fortunately there is Day Watch (part 2) to finish the story."

1,A big let down,It was not worth buying. I could only imagine this being enjoyable to watch if I had not read the books. I was severely disappointed after the positive reviews and the quality of the book. This movie is a abomination that happens to be based on an excellent book.
1,Travesty,I saw this movie in the theater. The movie is in Russian but the DVD does not let you see the movie in Russian but makes you watch it in English. The movie had excellent subtitles but they are not working in the DVD. Buy it if you must but rent it instead.DON'T THINK THIS IS THE REAL MOVIE.
2,I was disappointed,"I really thought this film was going to be something special. After it first came out and the fairly positive reviews it received I filed it into my memory as a film I wanted to see. Now that I've seen it I'm rather disappointed. I found the story to be pretty flimsy, with characters who I could find no relevance to and plotlines that went nowhere or went somewhere and then made no sense. Overall I'd avoid this film unless you want to see a few neat visual effects."
3,Good if you've not read the books,This is a good movie if a) you haven't read the books and b) you like your movie villains hammy and cartoonish.
1,Misrepresentation-Biting Off More than it Can Chew,"An ugly example of a glorified photo album. The authors can't handle the magnitude of the graffiti phenomenon beyond New York City borders. Misrepresentation and clutter abound. One needn't venture past Subway Art to glimpse Chalfant at his finest. As for Prigoff....who is he and what has he done? Weak prognosis all around. Sorry guys, try again or better yet, move on to another culture worthy of outsider exploitation."
1,Beautiful Blanket with Unfortunate Controller Problem,"We purchased the blanket because we felt it was superior in quality. Since it costs at least double what common blankets cost, it seemed likely that the company had done it right. Unfortunately, the first blanket controller started giving an E3 error within two weeks. We followed the instructions to try to reset it and that didn't work. We exchanged the blanket hoping the replacement would function properly.After three weeks a new controller began displaying the E3 error.When we plugged the other side's controller in, it worked. We tried tocontact the manufacturer to request a new controller and to see it theyhad addressed the issue with a new design but it was impossible to reach them. Bottom line is we returned the second blanket and gave up.Seems like the blanket is high quality and the electronics in the controller are not."
1,Nice & Soft Blanket but until the problem with the controller,"This is a very nice and soft blanket, the best out of all electric blanket. However, I have to return 2x due to the malfunction controller. After only 2 weeks of usage, one of the controller started blinking E and no heat at all. Same problems twice!I can't recommend this item until the problem is fixed."
1,Buyer Beware,"My blanket never heated up to a very warm temperature, even at the highest setting. Then after 3 months of use, it broke. Will not buy from this company again."
1,One Star is really generous,"I bought TWO of their blankets.They lasted one day & Two weeks before the error message started flashing.I contacted the manufacturer but they DO NOT stand behind their products.WestPoint HomeP.O. Box 625 (if you use the Post Office)1056 Commerce Ave (if you use Fed Ex or UPS)Chipley, Fl 32428Attn: EP RETURNS866-643-4735If you buy this product, you might want to write down the return information now...because you are going to need it."
2,Buy American,Set up for failure with items imported. From now will purchase American labels if I can find them. Never have had so many problems with products shipped here from China and other places vs made in America. Moving on.
4,This Game Goes All The Way!,"EA Sports is the ""Grand Master"" of all sports' games. NCAA Football 2001 is nothing short of sensational. It truly has almost anything that you can think of.The graphics are top notch, even down to the detail in the grass and painted logos. The players look quite realistic, and the stadiums are true-to-life. There are many different playing levels, each as entertaining as the next.The best part of the game, by far, is the sound. The school songs have never been clearer, not to mention the wonderful fan chants and fight songs. This truly adds to the college football game atmosphere, making a fairly complete experience. The only downfall of the game is the lack of an announcer (otherwise, it's 5-star game).Overall, the game is one entertaining experience. It represents the college gameday feel better than any other Playstation game on the market. This game is a touchdown!"
4,I'm not even a fan of the Deftones,"... but this is a good album to buy. I like the typical Digital Bath, Change, Passenger, Hole in the Earth, etc., but I don't own any other Deftones CDs. I saw them this year at Family Values Tour 2006 and thought they sounded bad so I had my doubts about this album but I listened to it and changed my mind immediately. This is certainly worth it - very catchy atmospheric heavieness. 4.5 stars."
4,Is it as good as the old stuff? Nah. Is it worth listening to? Oh yeah.,"Well, Deftones finally came out with a new single on the radio called Hole in the Earth. I was simply excited to hear some new stuff by one of my favorite bands, but after a few listens I admit I was dissapointed. Thankfully, the rest of the album is not too shabby. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece like White Pony, Around the Fur, or Adrenaline, but it has it's redeeming qualities. My personal favorite being the slower, melodic Xerces. It's almost like a Team Sleep-Deftones cross-over. Rapture is heavier and almost reminds me of their older stuff, striking a nice chord with me. My favorite ""heavy"" song on the album is Mein, in which Serj Tankian from System of a Down assists Chino with the vocals.All in all, I can't say the album is as hard hitting as their past stuff was, but that doesn't make it all that bad. It's nice to add to the rest of your Deftones CDs."
1,"OHHHH MY GOD, Worst movie ever made??","I saw part one of the toxic avenger movies and thought it was pretty fun. But this one, was pure waste af time.do never ever see this, it is bad, very bad. If you have not seen part one, go right ahead, but stay far away from part two, it's f...... bad."
3,Toxic Avenger Part II,"First off all, the dvd of The Toxic Avenger Part II that you can buy individually, although labeled unrated directors cut is exactly the same as the R-Rated version that was originally released from Warner Bros on VHS.Melvin, had destroyed all of the evil in Tromaville until Apocalypse Inc moves into town. Apocalypse Inc. wants to take over Tromaville, so they devise a plan to get the Toxic Avenger out of Tromaville long enough for them to take over the town. The Toxic Avenger is sent to Japan on a quest to find his father. In his absence the people of Tromaville have no choice but to do what the Apocalypse Inc want them to do. Of course once the Toxic Avenger returns he takes on the Apocalypse and runs them out of town. The Toxic Avenger Part II is nowhere as good as the original Toxic Avenger, but it is far from terrible. If you loved the first one you should at least like this one. 3 stars!"
2,Not as good as the first,I saw toxie 1 and thought it was the best then I rented part 2 hopeing it would be as good not a chance.First toxies face looked better in the first and his arms didnt look bubbly just white.Also what happend to all the mindless gore instead they have cartoon violence.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the voice sounds better then in the first one and when he was on the toilet.
3,Domingo sat down on the job,"""Celeste Aida"" is the big aria. Any self-respecting tenor would use this aria to stir the audience into frenzy, as intended by Verdi. When Domingo hit the big high note, he decided to cut it short and sat down. And sat down he did. He still got his usual ovation at the Met. If it was at Parma, he would have been boo'ed off the stage, Domingo or not. I have to agree with three of the reviewers that this was a sub-par performance by Domingo. Seven years earlier, in 1982, he did not cheat in his Deutsche Grammophon recording (available on CD). He was Domingo.One key performer can ruin an opera in one key aria! Millo, Milnes, and Zajick were superb.Domingo has the last laugh, of course. He lasted half a century by cheating here and there, whereas many of his colleagues lasted only half as long."
5,Grand Opera at its best,"Since I have bought this version, I have had the opportunity to see this production live at a nearby theater. Many years ago, I saw this opera in London when I was on leave from the Army. At that performance, I thought the grand march would never end and that the actors walked off stage and returned a few minutes later to continue the march. When I came to that part of this version, I was naturally curious as to how it would be accomplished. I was not disappointed as the Met did a super job in its presentation. Now, I can't wait to see the Live in HD Met version which provided backstage work by the crew in changing the sets, for which I would have paid anything to be able to sit and observe it all from backstage.Since seeing the backstage work, I have an appreciation of the enormous sets for this production."
3,I love the music,"I got to see a one day benefit with Sutton Foster, Hunter Foster, ANn Harada, Christian Borle, Jennifer Cody and Deven May. That cast far outclasses this one AND the London one. Both casts are awful. The music is adorable, but that cast is so bad that it majorly brought down this rating. Buy the London one because it has more songs but if you buy either version, be wary of the awful casts."
5,Get this item before it blows,"Spyro: Year of the Dragon is great. It is fun. I like everything about this item. Some people say "" Your a girl and Spyro is for boys."" Spyro is for boys and girls because it is adventures and daring. I only put 3 stars for how durable this game is because if you put the disc in the wrong way, it will brake. All and all, Spyro is fun for EVERYONE."
5,I love this game!,"Don't be worried because this came out so soon after Spyro 2, it's wonderful! The worlds are gorgeous as always and the new characters really add variety to the game.The difficulty level is about the same as the other games, not too easy, not too hard, so you can actually play the game instead of getting frustrated by it.Highly recommended!!!"
5,spyro lover!,"I love this game!!! Beating the Sorceress is SO much fun. I've already done it 3 times! I like the graphics because they're so realistic. If you're looking for a super-fun game, Spyro is AWESOME!!!!"
4,Spyro-Year of the Dragon - WOW!,"I love this game! My husband loves this game! Our kids and grand-kids love this game. It's truly challenging and fun! There is a bug in the Speedway levels and I could not get around it, even though I did the level according to another reviewer's suggestion. It's not the ""time attack"", it is the ""Race the Bumblebees"" or ""Race the Bi-planes"". I raced the Bi-planes right off, and I still didn't get the egg. Since you need all 150 eggs, you won't be able to do the final ""Bonus Level"". But, with all the fun it has been, I really don't mind, too much."
5,Great father & son game,"I play this with my four year old. Playing as the bird is great, and the skateboarding sequences are outstanding.This is a great game, with absolutely no flaws."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT!,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PS1 GAMES I HAVE EVERY PLAYED I AM TELLING YOU TO BUY IT BECAUSE IT IS FANTASTIC
1,Spyro year of the dragon,This game does not work. I would like to exchange it for another one or get my money back. You can't get to other worlds because it goes blank. I feel that the games being sold should be checked for problems.
4,This game's pretty good,"This game is pretty fun. There are a alot of vehicles and playable characters. The only problem is that it is a bit too much like Spyro Ripto's Rage and Spyro the Dragon. My favorite thing is that you don't have to buy moves like in the second Spyro. If you like the Crash games, this game is pretty similar to most of them. That's pretty much it."
5,great game for all ages,"this is an excellent game...family members from 5 to 55 years old have played this game and it was enjoyed immensely by all. the graphics on this game are great...colourful, eyecatching...i enjoyed just watching the others play :-)the kids sat for hours playing this.anyone who has kids knows that silence can be worrying...lol :-)...we kept going down to the basement to check on the kids as they were so quiet...no shouting, screaming, arguing :-S...but everytime we checked thinking they were probably up to some mischief or other we found them playing spyro...sitting quitely, sharing nicely, having fun wthout half killing eachother in the process!...spooky or what?...lol ;-)this game is definitely a real winner :-)"
5,Absolutely mesmadazzmarizingly depressing.,"Caution: if you are spiritual, Catholic, Christian,Muslim or of any such faith that is devoted to spreading the light of truth and beauty in the midst of darkness. With respect to belief in a being of higher authority. and you are a music fan ( not to mention a guitarist) you should know that it is my fondest belief, that Stanley Jordan has engaged in some form of questionable magic? as it is obvious that he has sold his soul (like Hendrix before him) to play the way that he does (mind you the band ain't too shabby either). I have seen the man live and it is simply depressing. The fact that one individual could play the way that he does, is both inspiring and humbling, especially if you are one who picks up the same instrument as Mr. Jordan.Peace:The*Hot*Wax*Kid"
3,Kind of slow...,"The big problem with this book is that we focus totally on Rikus and the battle to save Tyr against the armies of Urik. His army, a ragtag mixture of former slaves, templars, and nobles, is interesting, but the infighting becomes a drag. There are battles after battles yet it seems that the action seems to slow down the plot, as the characters don't get a chance to develop. Frankly, I almost skipped to the third book. It feels almost like Troy Denning let somebody else write the second book and then just slapped his name onto the cover."
3,an alright book,"As a beginner, I don't have a lot of experience at Tai-chi, but I feel this book was useful. However, most of the pictures are taken from the back, and while some have an insert showing the action from the front also, most do not, and it is very frustating trying to guess where his hands are when you can only see the model's back. I feel it is still a good book and may yet be a good giude to learning Tai-chi. In attempting to hold the book flat and open to a page while I practice, I have noticed that the book is falling apart already. It has a textbook price and a pamphlet like binding. For this reason and because the pictures are taken from the back at times, I felt three stars was reasonable."
5,amazing and invaluable reference guide for students,First of all I don't believe this book is a do it yourself/alone teaching manual. It's a very detailed and informative reference guide for someone studying with a qualified teacher. The book is meant to guide you in the learning process and is not meant to be your sole guide to Tai Chi. I recently began my study of Tai Chi and found this book as an invaluable help to my understanding and practice. It's required reading meant for the serious beginner.

4,"Great event, but dont pay to much for it","I just wanted to let everyone know that my local Wal-Mart has just put out a huge display of old wwe wrestling dvds. Unforgiven 2004 was one of them. The price?? how about $3.88 brand new unopened!!! So, for old those sellers selling this for $7.00 to $8.00 used, you better come down, cause Wal-Mart has it for $3.88 NEW! oh, and there is no shipping charges at Wal-Mart..The used price for this should be around 1.00."
3,CODE to Dracula....,"OIKX KQAU RT2S S5AA..... there, check if my memory is ok after 20 years or so (oh my GOD over 20 years since I first played!!). Anyway, I'm pretty sure that's the one, go all the way to your left.... then down the stairs, and all the way to your right and you'll meet with the guy, you ARE fully loaded at this point so go ahead and just unleash hell to Mr Dracula!"
2,A LITTLE BORING,"Castlevania 2 in the sequel to the original castlevania but it's completelly different , you have to bo back and forth in the cenario , it's not a linear game ( i don't like this type of games) and the ending is horrorible the worst ever made."
1,Very Frustrating,"I first bought this project because I needed to switch between my computer and my xbox on my monitor. The first switch that i received worked for a few days. Then on of the switches stopped working. The 'B' port started to randomly cut off and go black pretty frequently. Eventually the 'B' side stopped working completely. Without much hassle, I contacted the seller and they were very willing to send another switch. Well, after about a few weeks I finally had my new switch. Once I started to use the new switch I had the same exact problem. The customer service was good, however the product was awful. I had two of these boxes and neither of them worked. It also makes the picture slightly worse. When I used this product I noticed small static lines that ran up the screen. I do not reccomend this product as it has caused me nothing but frustration."
2,I couldn't reach Mike Phillips,I was disappointed. I really expected more jazzy sounds but found the disk to hold on to funk!! The tracks were to scattered. Nothing seemed to fit from the first song to the last. The disk sounded like every other sax player out there. No originality... Don't be fooled by the hyp.
5,Great Resource to explain touches.,"I used this book not only during a therapy session, but also with my own daughter. It is a great resource to explain the three kinds of touches. The pictures can make it uncomfortable for some people to read and see, but overall it is a great book."
1,Almost pornographic!,"I was shocked to find so many illustrations of blatently naked people. There should absolutely be a disclaimer in the description of this book before someone purchases it to show to children. In my profession, as well as a parent, I would never consider showing this book to a child, certainly not one where sexual abuse may be a part of their life and/or needs to be addressed. With all of my education and professional experience, this book is almost a how-to be a pedophile! I am floored at this author's ""qualifications"" and am so disappointed in this purchase. I will be returning it immediately."
5,a great skillet at a reasonable price,This more than met my need for a small skillet. Appears to be well made and works well on my electric range.
2,Dented Skillet,"This 8-inch Revere skillet arrived with a large dent in one side. It was not obvious under the factory-installed wrapping so I don't blame the shipper. I would return it but it only cost $15 and the dent does not interfere with functionality unless you need to put a lid on the pan. For my use, it will work okay; it's just asthetics: flat where is should be round. If I had purchased it from a local brick and mortar, i would ruturn it. I'm not pleased with the purchase. I have a set of copper-bottomed Revere pans that I've had for 30 years, still using them everyday. I thought it would be a good skillet."
4,Sooo much fun to play,"I love this game to pieces. The graphics are colorful and cute. I enjoy the battle system, as you can control the character's physical/magical attacks -- making the game part action, part RPG. The story remains engaging throughout and the learning curve is pretty easy.My only grievance with this game is that it's so short. It can easily be completed it in 7 hours (or less). There's only one town and one relic that the characters are after -- even though they keep talking about how there are so many relics in the world.I wish I could give this game 5 stars.. but it [stinks] to pay so much for a game that'll barely entertain you for a day or two."
4,"Alright, I guess","This game is pretty annoying because there's a person I don't know who says, ""3, 2, 1, go"" (well I suppose it's Uka uka). I have the strategy guide and there's no way you can get out of the last warp room. (It the warp room where all the bonus games are). And I can never go past the first one. Well all the Create Crush levels are pretty bad. And the easiest things are the pogo stick levels. It's still a pretty good game."
3,Dingodile and Tiny,"I am not giving this game 5 stars because dingodile and tiny are on crashe's side. That is so wrong. I mean that guy, rilla roo is a stuped monky its a good game."
5,Too Good to Resist!,This is another great Crash Bandicoot game that all PS gamers should enjoy. it has pleanty of characters and an exciting plot. aku aku and his evil twin brother uka uka are at it again. uka uka wants to fight his brother and take over the world but aku aku and crash won't stand for that. there are old characters that you already love as well as a few new ones. this game is for one to four players and keeps you locked to the screen. I love it!!!!!!!
2,Postage Hog,"Seller commented that there was some highlighting, book had way more than expected. I paid 3.99 for shipping and handling and seller paided the cheapest mode of shipping causing book to take 9 days to ship from Wash St to Okla then pocketed the remainder,no refund. If true value would of been spent book may of showed up earlier or atleast had tracking to confrim senders obligation was meet,this wasn't done."
5,Slumber Parties What Do I Do? Have Fun!!,"This book is packed full of party fun. You can use this book for slumber parties, overnights, babysitting, or even special family nights. From themed invitations to themed food, this book has it all covered. I am a parent as well as a day care provider, this book is fun to use any time day or night."
1,"It is probably the worst web cam ever ""minus 5 stars""","For the price there are better cams everywhere,take your pick.Seriously,this thing is a huge pain to install.once you get it done the image is bad,the focus is laughable.The company has links to fix the installation and green/focus problem that go nowhere.Anyone who says different is probably trying to unload a bunch of them.....(5 stars??????)"
1,a book that i felt was a waste of time,"unfortunatly, having been a former student that did leave disenchanted, i found that after careful consideration, this is mostly a book of fairy-tales. i had reached the level of 2nd black before i had my eyes opened by studying under qulified instructors. i do believe that i did gain from being in the art, but the comercalism destroyed it. Sin may have the knowledge, but certainly none of the skills of a grandmaster as is evedent to anyone that has had the chance to see him preform time and time again. i have talked to people that know him personally and have been told that he has an extensive video library. i will let you come to your own conclutions. good luck on your journey and read this book with a grain of salt."
1,What?,"That's what I kept saying to myself as I read this. What did he just say? They wore gis in China! Well, hell, why didn't I see that. I mean I've been to China, studied Chinese history, and I hadn't ever seen that, but I guess it must be true since a grandmaster said so. Go read something else, this is a pieced together book of silly stories."
1,"Amazing, but not in a good way.",Go read something else. Spend your time and money somewhere else. Go read some of the other reviews for the author's other book. Too many silly things no respectable martial artist would even try to claim.
1,"""Sin"" is an appropriate name for the author.","In this comical book, Sin The claims to be able to ""sense"" who calls him on the phone before picking it up. He obviously could not ""sense"" that Americans are not complete fools and would NOT believe this hog-wash. I suppose next he will claim to be able to shoot lightning bolts from his eyes?"
4,This is an increadible book.,"My only main gripe about this book it that it is to short. But, because I think Grandmaster Sin Kwang The is one of the most incrdible people on the planet (and yes, I have met him)I fell I must say a few things on his behalf. Almost everyone that gave this book one star said how unreal some of the facts are. The main point was that it seems imposible for The to have learned over 900 forms. First of all, the temples (there are seven) has been in existance for over 1700 years. Is it really imposible that together 7 temple have invented over 900 forms. I don't think so. Almost all other facts in this book can be supported by other reputable sources. Also, The is an incedible man. He knows 7 languages, is a Nuclear Engineer, and is the Grandmaster of an incredible art. Overall, this book has some great information,especialy on internal arts. A must by for students as well as people just getting into the art."
1,This book is full of lies and falsehoods,Anyone who *really* studies martial arts and their history will certainly know this book is full of lies and falsehoods. People who study this style may say they are the last true lineage of shaolin but that is a joke. I ask these people to really study the history of martial arts as well as the reality of martial arts and they will quickly understand how Sin The' is nothing but a marketing machine. I'm returning this book as soon as I get the chance.
2,Evaluating the book,"Fellas, let's evaluate the book itself: it is well written, the author succeeds in passing what he wants to transmit, it is clear and understandable; however there are some historical facts that are wrong. Since the book talks about an art, I have to give my comments about the art as well: Any martial art is based upon honor, truth, virtue, honesty, etc. Therefore, if there is any reason to believe that the facts that its founder writes on his book are wrong, it makes his art not honorable, and decreases the value of this book. This makes me give the book two stars."
1,"sorry that only 1 star is the lowest option, it deserves 1/2","This is not the X-files and there is no hidden agenda to the bad reviews of this book and its co-author, Sin Kwang The'. The last review suggests that those with negative reviews go to a shaolin do school to see if it is the real deal. What this person fails to realize is that the majority of the bad reviews were FROM those of us that HAVE been in Shaolin Do schools and found it NOT to be the real deal. That should tell the world something in and of itself. The book is an interesting read, I will you give you that, but it is not truth."
3,The New World Order Exposed,"This is a huge and very good book that covers all the usual topics that are generally covered in the ""conspiracy"" field. 9-11, the federal reserve and international banking families, the JFK assassination, media control, corporations ferminting wars, CIA shenanigans, etc.Although almost all of this book seems to be rehashed from other sources he does a good job of putting it all together. There are a few very hokey sounding chapters that read like a corny ficticious detective story where Thorn claims to be visited and given information from some mysterious undercover agent type which that I could have did without though. The big thing that makes me leery of Thorn though is he has ran a campaign trying to defame some very admirable people who do a lot of great work, like Alex Jones, Jeff Rense and Jack Blood. I attribute it more to sour grapes than him being a disinformation agent as some have claimed though."
4,Overlooked Reality,"This is a necessary, long overdue work reminding us that the ethnic sufferings in Caucasia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Balkans during the last 200 years were not all one sided. Many thousands of Moslem families suffered the same tragedies and walked the same dreary road into exile as their Christian neighbors. The massacres and wholesale population transfers were mutual and massive. Conventional wisdom in the West about the tragic events listed in this book is sadly one-sided. McCarthy has made a valuable contribution to remind people of the complex reality of these issues."
1,Take this book with a grain of salt . . .,"This book is an attempt to take the blame off Turkey for its past and blame others for its ethnic problems. For example, no distinction is made between war victims, and those deliberately murdered by a government--Genocide. While much of it is certainly true, one must realize the context in which it is written. The best way to put it might be like this- Mr. McCarthy writing this book, would be similar to: a revisionist historian, who denied the Holocaust, had testified before Congress (to deny the Holocaust) at the request of an unrepentant German government, then writing a book about German exiles and immigrants who were the victims of a great Jewish/Bolshevik conspiracy. If you know this first, then it may be a book worth reading. The little-told story of Muslim exiles and war victims, is certainly worth telling, but it should not be used as propaganda to fuel the fire of those who would deny genocide--as it appears this book certainly will be."
4,On Second thought...,"I originally rated this poorly. I have since re-read the book, after a good deal of correspondence with the author, and have rethought my critique. The book is highly antecdotal, but also gives amazing insight into the pyschological bond between cousins. I had always valued that insight, yet failed to give proper credit for it in my review.My original opinion was based on an error in judgement. I initially mistook the quotes of some of the sources as the personal position of the author.It is well worth reading, for anyone who wishes to know more about cousin relationships. The book includes two chapters on romantic/marital entanglements, which, I will forwarn, may sometimes be unsuitable for the younger audience.One final caution... Be careful not to assume the quoted sources are the author's prejudice. It is quite easy to come away with that impression if one is not paying attention."
2,"Important topic, flawed study","Glassner addresses an important topic: US media makes a big deal out of, probabilistically speaking, unlikely dangers, while largely ignoring much more likely ones. An example of the former are plane crashes, while workplace injuries represent the latter. Unfortunately, Glassner decided to write a political tract rather than a balanced study. Readers who adhere to the leftist American liberal point of view are likely to shout ``Hear, hear,'' while reading this book, others will find it flawed, biased and, occasionally, succumbing to temptation to do a little fear-mongering itself."
1,Very overrated,"This reminds me of the sort of out-of-touch logic we were taught in college and graduate school. Truly, the mainstream media is biased (is there really anyone out there, in the internet age, who hasn't caught on to that, lol?) But in some ways the msm understates things that the author complains about. The violence shown, after all, is real. And Americans, in some ways, should be MORE, not less worried than they are. If you've lived in major cities ---and centers of media--- the manipulation of fact is even more noticeable. However, it's mostly selective manipulation--- up-playing and down-playing certain things. In some areas, there is more violence, more to be afraid of, and those things don't even make the media at all. So, it's NOT that the media is hype (though that too)--- but WHAT KIND of hype. As with most academics who've received no other real influences, this writer is not sophisticated to look beyond where he is, and start asking that question."
3,What should Americans be afraid of then?,"Apparently this author thinks Americans are afraid of the wrong things. I'm going by the book's subtitle, since I haven't read the book - I probably won't have time to read it either, especially since it's not the sort of thing I tend to read. On this occasion I can't be bothered reading any of the reader reviews either. Well, if the author believes that Americans are afraid of the wrong things, what does he think Americans should be afraid of? Surely it's not enough to just leave it at that - the author shouldn't just be focussing on the negative without providing some alternatives. This is a common problem with our society nowadays - people complaining about the way things are without suggesting alternatives."
3,It's alright,Required reading for my Writing 121 class. The author makes good points and backs them up effectively but at times feels a bit preachy.
4,excellent except for the zipped opening,"Excellent, sturdy bag, only existing problem is that when opening the double ended zip to get inside the main compartment of the bag, it does not unfold totally, keeps kind of falling back which is rather disturbing. The idea of the ""top"" opening from the body outwards is a great idea however."
2,Not a very intense workout,"Already having Gin Miller's ""STEP Reebok: Intense Moves,"" I was eager to try this workout. I wanted to like it, but I found it to be extremely boring. While there were a few intense moves, it does not compare to the Reebok video, as far as production quality or workout intensity. The video is really geared for people just starting interval training. If you are new to this type of workout, go for it. However, if you're used to her previous videos, you'll be disappointed."
5,We Love Gin Miller's Workouts,"My wife and I like to exercise together and she likes to do video workouts. The only one I could ever stand was one of the old Reebok step tapes. So my wife suggested we get some other Gin Miller videos. We got this one and Serious Strength. I really like these. I stay motivated, don't get bored, and feel like I am actually getting results, as opposed to other videos that just made me feel like I was flopping around pointlessly. Several of my muscle groups are feeling noticeably tighter and firmer after only a few weeks. We will definitely buy more of her videos so that we can vary our workouts even more."
5,"Shae Marks all the way, baby!","Dang! God must surely have been in an awful good mood the day HE decided to give us Shae Marks and her deleciously huge titties. Get this movie and, like me, experience a profound relegious occurrence as you watch her and them turn in a truly earth moving performance."
3,what ever happened to great movie directing?,"I don't really know what to tell you about, Day of the Warrior except that it is really stupid and has absolutely no piont at all. Team leathel is nothing more than a bunch of big breasted beautiful woman that don't know how to act. ""Buff"" Bagwell, gives a really funny performance even though it's not supposed to be funny. He should really learn how to act. Being a guy, i couldn't help but be sucked into the large amount of pointless nudity in the movie. The women all have great bodies even with the implants that they all have and if they weren't in this movie, i'd of given it a 1. Get this movie if you love stupid violence, terrible acting, and lots of titties."
4,Good Value,If you are looking for a replacement shower door to dress up a bathroom in your home at 1/2 of the price of other shower doors of similar quality then this is our door. Be careful to pay close attention to the measurements and and then buy with confidence. If you have a rental property this shower door simply cannot be beaten for functionality or value. The angled drip pan will keep soap residue and dust to a minimum while efficiently channeling water back to where it belongs; to the shower pan and down the drain. The silver and hammered glass is a good look as well.
3,MEDIOCRE,"MANY OF THE DRAWINGS INCORPORATED IN THIS BOOK DO NOT REALLY FASCINATE ME AS BEING REALLY FLOORED. THE FIRST BOOK IS SOMEWHAT BETTER. DESIGNS OF SUCH CREATURES AS WARG, OLYPHAUNT, AND FELL BEAST ARE NOT IN IT. A WHOLE CHAPTER DEDICATED TO GOLLUM IS SOMEHOW OVERLONG (ALBEIT NECESSARY). MAYBE THE THIRD BOOK WOULD FULFILL MY SATISFACTION."
3,The Essential Turing,"I had hoped more into the insights of Turing. This is a great hisitorical document about the development and logic of Turing's approaches to the issues of encryption, but it is not an easy read. This will have value to technology/history buffs who are very technically inclined, but it is not an easy read. This is a great collection of documents for a limited number of people."
1,A collection of Turing's papers,"Copeland's book is basically a collection of some of Turing's original papers, completed with a short introduction for each part of the book. I was disappointed by this book as (1) one can easily find copies of Turing's work on the web, (2) there is very little additional value in Copeland's comments, and (3) the papers are not reproduced in their original typeset and layout. Elsevier's ""Collected Works of A. M. Turing"" (4 volumes) does a much better job and offers Turing's complete work."
5,My two-year-old son loves this book!,"Even though the recommended age range for this book is 4-6, my two-year-old son loves this. He goes to his bookshelf specifically for it, ""Dads can't!"" I think this book shows the value of patience and mutual appreciation between parents and children, and I love it, too! The dad in the story reminds me of my husband, who is REALLY a wonderful dad!"
1,bad electrical plug and very noisy,I had the item for 2 weeks and used it three times. The plug went bad and I had to replace it. Also the washer is very noisy almost too loud to speak when using it.
1,Junk-Don't waste your money,"I bought this powerwasher thru Amazon as it was a good price for a 1500PSI electric powerwasher. Plus it came with the 17 piece accessory kit and free shipping. I hooked everything up and turned it on and it ran fine-for about 5 minutes. Then the motor started surging and then quit altogether. I called Powerwasher, Inc's 800# and it was an automated system that did not solve my problem but directed me to their website for live chat. They sent me a list of common sense troubleshooting tips, like: make sure it is plugged in. DUH! Nothing worked. So back to Amazon it goes. I will put the money towards a small gas pressure washer."
3,Broken wand but worked,This is a great washer and it takes very little effort to get started. I cleaned the side of my house in less than time then I expected.The wand that came with it however was broken which caused me some concern on the whole product BUT! Thankfully there is other wands that come with the accessory kit that I was able to use.Love the new washer
4,Super Washer,"This is the best value for money washer i have owned.The accessories are really helpful and useful ,only thing i dont like about it is the detergent dispenser, it seems to empty very quickly , but apart from that it is a very useful tool."
3,It's OK But if you want Jane herself...,"She just released ""The Further Adventures of Little Voice"" singing all of the songs herself. It's only released in the UK, but you can order it through 101CD.com. If you love Jane, GET THIS CD!!!"
2,LV is sorely missed on this soundtrack,"I don't actually hate myself for buying this CD - it's an OK disc -, but it would have been nice to hear more of Jane Horrocks' interpretations of these pop classics instead of the original artists who can be found on other recordings. I was really hoping for an extended medley identical to LV's show-stopping debut in the movie. I'll probably listen to the video on my stereo TV more than I'll listen to this disc."
4,"Really Great, but......","I'd have to go with the fact that this is a great soundtrack, but with two flaws: one great, one small. The glaring omission of Jane Horrocks' singing more of the tunes is unforgiveable. She did SUCH a great job in the film. (I mean, was she robbed of an Oscar nom or what?) And while there's nothing wrong with Judy, Ethel and Shirley, the fascinating thing about the film was that Jane did do her own singing. There should be more of it on the CD.The small flaw: That Tom Jones song. I mean really! It just doesn't belong there."
1,"soundtrack, what soundtrack?","I was getting ready to buy this cd when I looked at the song list and realized that only 2 songs are sung by Jane Horrocks. What's up with that? I agree with Wayne Z. The truly enchanting thing about the movie was Miss Horrocks wonderful ability to capture the essence of the original songs. Nothing against the originals, but unless they come out with a ""soundtrack"" that includes more of Janes fabulous work, I'll just keep watching the movie."
4,be careful about progressive scan,"This is quite a good lcd screen and with the right sources it works well. However, note that is does not allow 480p progressive scan used in a lot of dvd players it will only allow the interlace mode 480i, which is lower quality."
5,Great Product,"Ive had this for about 4 months now & it is absolutely amazing- Im using it for 4- large dogs, it does a good job of keeping up as it isnt recommended for that many- I had this installed as my privacy fence was being put up- I dont think digging 2 feet in the ground would be fun, but if you are ambitious enough it will be worth ever minute of your time- This makes picking up so much easier!!!"
3,no success with our rocky soil,"We really wanted this to work for us. Our soil is very rocky and hard, so there was not good drainage for this to work. Unfortunately we had to fill it in. We still scoop our poo and put it in plastic bags for the poor garbage man to pick up!!On another note....we did use this system at our old house in a different county and it worked great! So...I should give it 5 stars...just depends on your ground I suppose."
5,The Everthing Bag,"You can carry everything you need with this camera bag. It has a very roomy interior with dividers that you can move around to suit your specific needs. You can pack a camera, two flashes and three or four lenes and filters and lots of extra film. This is one of the best bags that I have ever used."
1,Junk,The PUR faucet mount water filters are amongst some of the worst consumer products that I have ever seen. They are absolute junk. You will be lucky to get a few months out of one of these things before the housing splits and the thing sprays water all over the place. PUR will replace defective products. And the replacements will be defective also. Whoever runs this company should be in jail.
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought the PUR 2-Stage Vertical White Faucet Mount FM-3333B about 2 months ago. It was easy to install and worked right away. However, that didn't last long. The amount of water coming out of the filtered side slowed down quite rapidly. Barely two months after installing it, there is hardly any water coming out. The filter has an indicator that is supposed to flash green when the filter cartridge is good, and changes color to orange or red when it's time to change it. Mine didn't even get to that point and it stopped working. I never ran hot water through the filter which is a warning that came in the instructions. This is just very poorly constructed. This product was cheap, and worked cheaply. Don't waste your money. Make some more research and instead, buy a quality product that will work."
1,Didn't even last a month,"I bought this product at my local grocery store, but I am reviewing it here on Amazon.At first the filter was great. Installing it went smoothly, the water tasted great, and bypassing the filter for hot water also went smoothly. I was very pleased. But then, not even a month later (I'd say about 3-3.5 weeks later), the filter started to leak up top where it connected to the faucet. I thought nothing of it...until the darn thing ended up weakening and then fell off completely shortly thereafter. Very disappointed! I'm not going to replace it; I'm going to invest in a Brita pitcher instead."
1,Cheap Plastic will Crack Quickly!,"I have owned two of these units in the last two years. The first one was the more expensive 'chrome' unit, which is identical to the white one but comes with one 3 stage filter instead of one 2 stage filter. Both filters fit in both units, so its really disingenuous that they advertise the chrome unit as somehow different or better.The first (chrome) unit I had lasted about ten months, at which point it developed a leak in the see through indicator and would spray you with water when you used it.We moved, so I left the old unit behind and bought a new unit (the white one) in July. Now, only four months later, it has developed three seperate cracks, this time in the white casing. I find it unbelievable that Pur did not use stronger plastic. Now we are left with a box of filters we bought expecting to use, and a broken water filter. I have mixed feelings whether to buy another Pur unit or just throw the filters away and start with a new brand. Horrible product."
1,What a piece of junk,"This is possibly the worst product I've ever bought. Other reviewers have mentioned that their units cracked after replacing the original filter. I am SO ENVIOUS !!!I never got to replace the filter, as mine cracked before it was time to replace the filter. The first one cracked on the display housing. I tried to repair it, but it leaked and sprayed again. I thought perhaps I had accidentaly swung the faucet over and hit the filter unit against the window frame, cracking the unit.I bought another system and the second unit developedthe same problem, spraying water all over from the cracked window housingNow I can get a drink and take a shower at the same time.My advice: Stay away from this product, buy something else.This item gets one star because that's the minimum Amazon requires to publish a review, otherwise I'd give the PUR 2 stage water filter ZILCH !!!"
1,Poor Construction,I have beeen disappointed with PUR. This filter after 2 months of infrequent use has started to leak. It leaks from the filter life window. So the water spits out at you. I would not recommend this product.
3,static noise,It's a good price for a cordless phone with answering machine. But I'm not satisfied with the purchase. I had a Vtech and a Panasonic before. Neither of them gave me the static noise as this one does. Actually there were no such noise at all with the other 2 phones. I tried different channels to avoid it but failed.
1,Static and crappy battery,"When I first bought this phone about six months ago, I thought I was getting a good deal, but I was wrong. The phone picked up a lot of static and the battery has a very short life, only a couple hours off the charger then it won't work."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"The sacred music was beautiful to listen to, but I was disappointed that the video consisted only of watching people sing. I was hoping to see pictures of old churches, historical Roman sites, Christian art, the Christmas story, etc."
5,A must read for anyone interested in lizards or ecology.,Erik Pianka is one of the worlds finest ecologists. Hispassion for lizard ecology is infective. By the end ofbook you will feel like you know and have worked withPianka. His story shows what field biologists are all about.
1,Chinese Crap,I bought this accessory kit. The female quick disconnects are made of plastic. If you put even the slightest tention onthe fitting it will break! Even Harbor Freight Makes a better tool!!
1,Matthew Branstn from Australia listen,"IN ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS REVIEW YOU REFER TO ""SOCCER"" I'M FROM ENGLAND AND WE CREATED THE GAME ITS CALLED FOOTBALL GET IT FOOTBALL NOT SOCCER GET IT.I AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE RAW/SMACKDOWN PPV'S ALL THE TIME HOW CAN U SAY THE GREAT AMERICAN BASH WAS BETTER THATN JUDGEMENT DAY THE BASH WAS BORING NO BUILD UP AND JUDGMENT DAY WAS NEARLY AS BAD THE ONLY GOOD WWE PPV I HAVE WATCHED THIS YEAR IS SIUMMERSLAM IF U WISH TO REPLY WRITE YOUR COMMENTS ON SURVIVOR SERIES 2004."
1,Aspartame -- BEWARE,"Seems a little suspicious that not ALL of the ingredients are listed here. Do not be deceived. There is ASPARTAME in this ginger. Aspartame is a neurotoxin to the body and is extremely toxic. If you have any sensitives to consuming poison, I would steer clear."
3,Help,im new to using henna and i was wondering what the best mix is for it now i have to add a few more words so im laughing as im posint this i honestly just want to know how to mix the stuff there is nothing more to say
2,"Sounds like ""on hold"" music","The information presented is quite good, but the music just wasn't what I expected and I didn't care for it at all. First, I don't much care for electronic music. I prefer acoustic music for this sort of work. Our lives are full of enough electronics w/o taking the sound of them into meditation. Second, I just couldn't shake the feeling that, at any moment, a voice was going to break in with ""Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us and will be answered in the order received...."""
5,The Real Deal,"I recently caught Long John Hunter playing at John Lee Hooker's Boom, Boom Room in San Francisco. He came out at Nine and played straight till two in the morning. This Cd captures his live sound very well. He has a soulful singing voice and makes every note from his Fender Strat sing with great emotion. I had never heard of him before but during the show I knew I would be buying all of his albums. Get Owee Babee for his early recordings made in a Mexican Border town where he played all night every night. And for a true Blues experience go see the Man."
4,Great Bag for photographers with a lot of equipment,"A fairly nice bag. There is plently of space for most of your photography equipment like lenses, flashes, film, filters, and more. Several comparements and pockets and strong material. The dimensions are about 12"" x 9"" x 8"". Overall, a great camera bag for those serious photographers, one of the better camera bags yet."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother ordering this item because you will be sorely disappointed. I ordered this link and my card was promptly charged, but the link that was sent instead was an ""angel"" link that was completely different and only priced at half what I had been charged. Pugster does not answer the customer service line during their posted hours, and when they do choose to respond to emails do not want to address the error of having sent the wrong item. Pugster finally decided to respond and send a replacement only after I had to have Amazon intervene for a refund, and the replacement link was STILL wrong!!! I now have 2 poorly designed angel links and no music note link. Unbelievably poor service. Product received is not even close to what is represented in the picture - not even music related in any way. Company refuses to admit that there is an obvious error in their warehouse. Definitely not worth the time or hassle of ordering."
3,Ok,"Fan of inspector Lucas Davenport only (I did not like the Kidd serie at all) and his colleagues. It lacks a little bit of tension I found in others ( Mind Prey, Eyes of Prey..) and the idea he had to cut the same action in several paragraphs does not add anything but slowness ( why would he do that ? It seems to me it was not the case in previous ones ?).However I remain a big fan for the good sense of humor. The plots are good in general, the characters well defined and believable ( Sandford/Camp has the ability to expose us to some random thoughts of his characters thus making them credible and funny most of the time).Keep writing please because, no matter what, a new Davenport is a treat."
4,Fast read...,"I caught where it was headed just pages before the author let you in on who the suspect might be. Fast read, with plenty of action. I do not consider this book XXX as one reviewer noted.(I dont have to cover all the particulars since there are enough reviews)I will say that it does reference some matter that ot everyone should read, but most are grown enough to pass through. What is written in adds to the story and gives you the feel for the person behind the killings and that taunting. The different trails that get followed all make sense so the book is like watching a good crime story"
3,NOT A BELIEVABLE STORY,"I've read many of the ""Other"" Prey books, and this one seemed as though it was written using a computer-generated model. The descriptions of the violent scenes left me with no image of what was going on. It's difficult for me to distinguish left from right in these tales. Travel times over long distance, repeatedly, is not credible. It didn't keep me awake at nights reading it. I would awake in the middle of the night, read a couple of pages and fall asleep, But maybe that's just me."
2,Only one I've read or will read,"This is the only Sandford prey book I've read or attempted to read. I didn't finish it. It was far too violent for me. Violent to the point of being sick. I like a good murder mystery as much as the next guy, but Sandford's criminals are too over the top for me. Even the attempts at levity that are mentioned in one of the editorial reviews weren't enough to lessen the horror for me. I actually threw the book out to be sure my kids didn't get their hands on it. The two stars given were for being a renowed author and for continuing to have books published. I'm not critical of Sandford's ability to write, I just don't care for his content."
4,Lucas Tracks Psycho Pervs,"After reading this book I had two main thoughts; what a great mystery/thriller, and what a riveting, realistic portrayal of some of the most disgusting and frightening ""bad guys"" in crime literature. Lucas's interviews with the psycho sex killers made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and do the Macarena. If you're new to the Prey series, start at the beginning and work your way to this one...you won't regret it. Two minor complaints. ZZ Top's ""Legrange"" is better than either ""Well Dressed Man"" or ""Legs"", and Lucas is getting to old to whup up on the bad guys like he did in his youth."
4,Murder and Mayhem,"Great things come in small packages. When I first received this book through the mail, I thought ""oh, it is small"" but then I opened it up and the print was small, and while reading it I actually liked the size. this book is packed with a lot of mayhem and guess who, guess what and guess why! I read it in a few days and that is fast for me. Right away it grabs you from the start, and Sanford's style is easy to follow and I had no trouble in picturing the scenes and events. Lucas' bantering with Sloan is humorous, and creates the bond that has grown between these two. I have read all of Sanford's Prey books and there isn't one that I didn't like."
1,Don't bother buying this!,"I bought some of these for my 4th grade classroom because Scholastic had them on sale for $1 each. I wanted to use them for a literature study group. Wish I had read the book first... it was that bad! Instead of a plot, it has the stream-of-consciousness rambling thoughts of a Jr. High girl-- ranting that comes across as negative, self-centered, and irresponsible. I was reading it with a group of girls, but we didn't finish because it seemed such a waste of our time. The books are now in the recycle bin."
5,Highly Entertaining!,"We passed these out at Christmas and to say the least, the reactions were hilarious. While it would have been nice for the winnings to be real, it was plenty of fun the way it was."
1,"Grr,,,",It's a fun prank for people.... But it looks really fake and feels really FAKE.. Oh well I'm ganna give it to my school friends lol
3,1 Song Missing?,"Hi i fink this album was ok, js not upto the standards i thought it was going to be. The film was tottaly brilliant. It had everything in it, funny, action, gud story, etc...Der is js 1 song i am lookin for. U knw wen Whistlers Daughter is fighting in the subway, dat song that plays den. Its not on the album. Any1 knw wat song dat is? Because to me that is the best song on the album. The only songs i like frm this album are. Rza - Fatal and Manchilds song. I fink Blade 2 S.T was betta den dis. But still 3 out of 5 because the other songs are listenable aswel. Anyway sum1 please find out the name of that song for me. Thanks...Regards, Mani..."
4,song help,when i first heard the soundtrack i was thriled and mad. i was thrilled because the soundtrack was hot but i was mad because the theme that i heard in the movie wasnt in there. the theme that im talking about is in the beginning after the highwasy chase blade shots that white guy the theme starts to play while the vampire lady was recording. the theme is played again when blade is outside by the water and he is taking his serum and the little girl starst to talk to him the theme is played again. the theme is played again when hannibal king was chained up in that room and the vampire lady was in front of him telling him something the theme is played again. then the theme is played for the last time after blade killed dracula and there both lying dowen and dracula is talking to him the theme is played again if anyoneknows these them please help me email me at click40211@aol.com
3,The song during the blade-drake fight...,"To the one looking for the song during the blade-drake fight: supposedly the song is ""Weapons of Mass Distortion"" by the Crystal Method.I like that song alot, too...so I was really up for looking for it. Hope this helps."
4,Interesting Overview,"This book is an interesting overview of the UFO phenomenon. I recommend this book for people curious about UFOs, who haven't done extensive reading on the subject. It primarily focuses on UFO phenomena in the United States, with a very good section on the U.S. government's official response to UFOs.Particularly useful is the glossary of terms and institutions in the back of the book. It helped me keep all the various government agencies and projects straight. Bill Yenne does a very good job of presenting the evidence and letting the reader decide for themself. If you are looking for a good book to introduce you to UFO evidence, I recommend you start here."
3,UFOs! Who knows?,"UFOs! Who knows? Not everyone can be lying, right? Some say it's possible but not likely. While others as it's not possible at all. Some people (on both sides) are clearly ""nuts"" but which ones?I keep thinking of Black Holes and Cealacanths, Starships and Bigfoot. Are we as intelligent as we think we are or are we as imaginative as children? Mass hysteria or the beginning of a new age, until one lands, opens the door and gives CNN an interview, we will never know! (Or did that already happen?)I read this book while I was sick in bed. It was something to take my mind off that sour feeling in my stomach. But it made me wonder ""How would my stomach take seeing that silent silver disk floating out side of my bedroom window?"""
4,"This CD used to be called ""Tuff Dude""","This was one of my favorite CD's when I first started listening to jazz, especially jazz drummers, in high school. I bought three B. Rich CD's and got rid of the other two within two years but I have bought this one twice and plan to buy it again. A good, solid, enjoyable chunk of music. ""Nica's Dream"" in particular is on my personal internal soundtrack; I've been humming and singing it for years, with accompannying chest drumming for the breakdowns, particularly when it's closing and cleanup time at the current job. Good physical music with guts, flow, punch, and soul and yes, it jams. Not a classic; not recommended as a building block for the foundation of a serious jazz library, thus the four stars, but buy it as soon as your collection is on its feet and you are ready for a little true fun."
5,A Perfect Fit!,"After purchasing my first camcorder, the next thing was to pick up a nice case to keep my investment safe. My initial reason for purchasing this bag, was because of the Samsonite name. However, once I received the bag my pleasure went beyond the name. Besides a numerous amount of pocket space to hold all your extra goodies, the main compartment has an adjustable Velcro divider that holds your camera snug while you're on the go. A feature that the description above fails to mention. Overall it's a great case for anyone looking to store their camcorder in a safe place."
1,Uniden DXI-986-2 Cordless Phone,There is a lot of static when using the phone. Called customer service and went through 3 steps they gave me to correct the problem but the problem is still there. Very frustrating trying to use a phone with static interference.
3,Don't place near a computer,I purchased the Uniden to replace a cordless phone that provided very limited range. The Uniden has a similar problem so I can only surmise that the placement of the phone near a computer monitor is the problem. The directions indicate to make sure the base unit is not near a monitor but that is tough if you want a desk phone. The reception is fine if you stay near the base.
2,If you enjoy static..............,"If you like the sound of static and enjoy moving around so you can get a clearer signal, then this is the phone for you.People often ask if I am on my cell phone because the reception is so bad. Don't waste your money. I would never buy a Uniden product again"
5,Also available in Dark Gray / Black,"Rated number 1 by "" Consumer Reports"", I gave these a try. The sound quality is outstanding and range is very good. There were a few little hisses when I ventured outdoors in front of our house and the backyard but nothing major. For $33 including shipping delivered to our door, It's a great deal. I found and purchased a dark Gray / Black version instead of the standard White found everywhere else. I wanted something darker than the White that would hide dirt a little more and found they do make a dark Gray version (DXI 986-2C) The last letter ""C"" for the Charcol color. Not mentioned is the LCD screen has a nice green backlight. The transfer feature to the second handset is very handy. You can put the second phone anywhere theres an outlet with no need for another phone line. Only the main base unit needs the phone line. To transfer you hit a button and the second phone rings and puts the first phone on hold until the other phone is picked up."
5,excellent quality,"Phones have been working excellently and gotten highest rating from leading consumer test magazine. The person who wrote that he ""didn't have a very good experience (bad apple maybe?)"" - I had the same problem but it had to do with the battery not the phone."
3,Mysterious noises!,"The setup was easy, and getting the phone to operate was simple. However, actual use is another matter. Consumer Reports gives this product a high rating in sound quality, but we were very disappointed. It is impossible to get high volume for the incoming calls - ""maximum"" volume is just barely acceptable (and neither of us have a hearing problem). More significantly, for the first 30 to 60 seconds of each call, we hear odd buzzing and beeping that almost obliterates the other person's voice. Oddly, the other person does not hear these noises. We've tried all the troubleshooting fixes in the owner's manual, but no luck. Now we're trying to get Uniden customer service to respond."
1,Not-happy,"Both phones have the same problem, very weak, tunnel-like reception, while other party hears loud and clear. Unusable. I called the company and was told to send them back for repair. So far, I have been too disgusted to do so. It isn't worth the aggravation and expense. This set was recommended by Consumer Reports. I paid 30 bucks and the next week the single phone was on sale at Benny's for 10 bucks."
5,Cinema Paradiso,Ennio Morricone's music is Classic and will live on. It is the perfect complement to a truly GREAT film.It is never tiring and I listen to this daily!
4,"looks good so far, but not used yet","Received the bag when they said it would be delivered... CHECK!Bag was new, with original tags and in new condition...CHECK!The bag quality seems to be great. Nice thick outer material and the zipper seems nice and sturdy. It came with a day bag which was a unexpected bonus.I have not actually used the bag yet, although I did pack 4-boards into to verify they would all fit, and I had room to spare.The bag will take its first flight next week to Puerto Rico, so I will follow up this review when we land back in the states.The only complaint I have is I did not get to choose the colors of the bag. There appeared to be a blue and green bag, but I received an all black bag (which I don't mind) but this is not a deal killer for me."
1,Not as advertised!,The batteries I received from ebatteries were not the ATT/Lucent brand pictured here. I received an off-brand that were supposed to work in my cordless phone but were DOA and couldn't be charged. I did receive a full prompt refund but had to pay return shipping and had to order the correct batteries elsewhere.
2,Kind of Dopey,I took a chance on this video for my granddaughters and I must say it did not hold their interest. The story is kind of goofy. There are many other Easter videos that are much better.
5,Another Great Dumpy Adventure!,"Here is another Dumpy story with just the right amount of action, suspense, and the slightest hint of danger, as well as lots of vehicles, for little boys to enjoy. My 4 year old loves Dumpy books and this one is no exception! The illustrations are bright and the text is substantial--not dumbed-down for smallchildren. We look forward to more Dumpy books in the future!"
5,Would you believe that the Ghost is a Rolls Royce.,"The Billingsgate family collects Rolls, puts on Rennaiscance Festivals, owns radio stations and raise bees for honey and mead. So many things should not all go wrong at the same time but they do and it takes Sarah and Max to find the clues that connect them all."
4,I'm happy with it,"It's a beautiful Bible - the cover is majestic, and the font is legible. But I too have noticed that the gold is flaking off the page edges. I bought a Zondervan bible cover which fits it nicely - hopefully that will extend its life.I'm happy with the translation. It retains the majesty of the RSV, yet it's good to know that the thees and thous have been updated, and that traditional Catholic renderings are used in a few key places.I don't mind the lack of introductions or extensive notes. As Mortimer Adler says in ""How to Read a Book"", ""you should not read a commentary by someone else until *after* you have read the book ... If you read them first they are likely to distort your reading of the book"" and ""it is best to do all that you can by yourself before seeking outside help""."
5,beautiful edition of a standard text for Catholics,"This edition of the RSV is recommended for Catholics. A good modern translation, founded on good scholarship, with all the books included (that protestants call the Apocrypha.)This is a particularly handsome edition, with a beautiful embossed cover. I purchased it for my oldest son, who's considering attending seminary, and he's very pleased with it."
2,Why don't Catholics have impeccably bound Bibles?,"Sure, they fixed the spelling errors and moved the notes to the same page. All of the glowing praise for this run of the mill Nelson produced bible just goes to show that Catholics have no appreciation for wrapping the Word of God in the finest materials. The nicest bibles in the world are bound by R.A Allen [...] and Cambridge Press. I have yet to find a Catholic bible that has a concordance. It is a good thing that Catholics do not reverence the Eucharist as they do bibles otherwise they would be celebrating the Mass with paper plates and Dixie cups rather than a gold chalice and paten, etc. To get a fine bible, you have to buy a Protestant bible, its a shame."
5,Quite a good Bible,"I was looking for a Bible which (a.) contained the deutero-canonical books, (b.) used language which, while pretty and formal, wasn't so archaic as to be uncomfortable or undecipherable, (c.) was attractive and formal enough enough to not look like it was trying to appeal to middle-schoolers or to no-one at all, and (d.) didn't bother about politically-correct ""gender neutrality"" which obviously didn't exist in the original text. (Any intellectually mature person will know when ""men"" means males, and when ""men"" means humans, and any emotionally mature person won't get his knickers in a twist about it.)This Bible does well in all the categories I just listed. It would have been perfect if it also had slightly larger text against slightly whiter and thicker paper...but these issues are slight ones."
5,Spot on !,"The best, most accurate Bible I have ever ownedPresented beautifully (Righteously so as it is the word of God)Very affordable, on amazon.com I purchased the Leatherback for 1/3 of the price that my friends all paid for a paperback at the book shop !!!"
3,Worth the Read,"Considering the book is only 75 pages to begin with, it was disappointing to read in the first 16 of those pages a lengthy lamentation on the shortcomings of modern academia, though the points the author made were well taken. Once he finally gets into his subject, the author does give us some interesting bits of information I had not found in other works on pre-Columbian America. It is worth the time to read this short book, if the subject interests you as much as it does me."
3,Inexpensive with a few problems,"The phone looks fine, doesn't take up a lot of table room, and the battery life is fine thus far. However, it is a little uncomfortalbe on the ear and the signal gets weak at certain places in my 900 sq ft apartment. Not huge problems if you aren't on the phone for hours on end."
3,Decent enough,"Its vertical design is well-suited for crowded nightstands and desks, and I haven't noticed any problems with its range and reception. The phone, however, feels very flimsy and hollow. Its bar-of-soap design discourages long conversations. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to disable the ringer or turn down the ringer volume -- although you do get a choice between two awesomely annoying ringtones. Considering what I paid for this phone (single-digit), though, I can't gripe too loudly."
3,A good book but too long,"This book has very good points, and it helps me a lot. But it's too long. I think 60 pages instead of 200 should be enough to explain those points."
5,Excellent Trader Psychology,An important book that does a good job of addressing the whole mental game of trading. Mark S. explains what it takes and how to do it. I highly recommend this book for anyone trading.
4,A must read for any trader - regardless of experience level,"An excellent book written by a very experienced trader and author. I still use, regularly, one of his entry/exit strategy's outlined in his book, Trading The Zone.Also, a very easy and enjoyable read.Kevin Gillespie"
3,"Worth the money, but hard work","I've never read such a repetitive book - some would say the author is reinforcing ideas and others would say he is padding the book out. There are great concepts contained within the book, so good that I believe it was worth the money - however if I had read one more paragraph about the young boy and the dog I think I'd have burst into tears.A strange reading experience, but I think a very rewarding one for my future trading."
2,"ok, but...","what mark douglas doesn't tell you until the end is that this book is written for those with an edge. i kept waiting for him to bring this up in the beginning. if you don't have a statistically measured edge, you will probably lose even more by employing what's in this book."
5,Trading in the Zone,Trading is mostly psychological. This book helps you with the mental blocks you may have and helps you get in the right mindset for successful trading.
4,Controlling your mindset,I am about 2/3 through the book and it is obvious that trading successfully depends strictly on you and how you approach trading. The book shows you why you fail to be a consistant winner. This book was recommended by my coaching staff. A good place to start to turn around your trading.Waterboy
3,"Poorly written, but solid advice","I've rarely seen bestsellers that are this badly written. The fundamental message is solid - think in terms of probabilities, always define your risk before entering a trade, remember to take profits etc. However, the author is extremely verbose in communicating these ideas and it often feels like he is digressing from the topic. For example, all that attempt at explaining the psychology of a trader often goes nowhere. I wish the author had co-authored the book with someone who knew how to write crisply, or else hired a good editor to fix his writing.I suggest that the reader make the effort to read this book once and write the gist of each chapter somewhere. Each chapter is so verbose that the gist can really be written in a few sentences. The reader will then never have to go through the pain to consult this book again."
3,London cast now available,"The London cast recording in English, circa 1972, is now available on cd in a limited edition from Kritzerland. Google Kritzerland if interested. I am not affiliated with them."
3,Vast But Flawed Coverage of Codes & Ciphers,"While this book covers a wide range of topics, I found it to be shaky on some topics. In particular, modern developments such as quantum cryptography, electronic warfare terms (SIGINT, ELINT, and especially RADINT--book description is wrong). Perhaps the author's strength is in historical cryptography, and he has not researched or does not understand modern developments. My overall impression is that the book covers an enormous range of topics, but in a shallow way. Cryptanalysis is not discussed in any depth, unlike other code/cipher books I've read."
3,Eva Marton?,"Dolora Zajick is amazing and blows the roof off the house as Azucena. Pavarotti's voice rings like a bell. Sherrill Milnes is incomparable. If you could only delete Eva Marton this would be 5 stars. But it is still worth purchasing just to Dolora Zajick sing ""Nostre Monte"" and the final scene with pyrotechnics and all."
1,yuck,I found this movie to not be any good. It was boring and very unentertaining. I wouldn't recommend it. Don't rent it.
3,"Fun, Funny and a Little Unbelievable","This movie kept me entertained with some snappy comebacks and some funny malapropisms by the head ""mean"" gymnastic. A combination of coming-of-age, comedy, outsider-meets-popular and sports flicks, Stick It manages to avoid too many cliches and have some original and surprising moments. There are the standard Parents Who Don't Understand and Tough But Loving Coach, as Missy, a former world-class gymnast who has retired is forced to return to competition after turning to a world of juvenile delinquency.The movie is rated PG-13, mostly for language I'm assuming, as there wasn't any nudity or any real violence, unless you consider bad gymnastic falls.I don't think I'll run right out and buy it, but I might get it once it goes on clearance."
4,Not too bad,"I had doubts, cause it seemed like a chick flick of the worst kind. But you know it was actually pretty gosh darn funny. I bought it for the GF and she liked it so I watched it with her. Nice story too."
1,"Gold medal winner in the ""Most Annoying Character In A Fictional Screenplay"" category","Some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops, she's sent to gymnastics camp (she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker). She thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid, she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time, it's all her parents fault of course because she's perfect, her dialogue consists of nothing but smart-aleck remarks that she says in that ""oh so cute"" way that fans of Lizzie McGuire may find clever...good grief. This is just beyond unwatchable. Even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old, and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds; It just grates on your nerves until you're about ready to shove the DVD through the paper shredder."
2,Princessmika,It doesn't give my nails a brought shine whats so ever it's horrible! I gave two stars because item was on time
3,"Can't rate, the book did not arrive!","I cannot review this book, it was never received. I tried to contact Amazon and don't know if I succeeded or not. Their website, I think auto response, said I had to contact the seller. I contacted three because a total of three books did not arrive and I have been contacted by two of them and they refunded my money. It looks like an interesting book and I was looking forward to reading it. SORRY."
2,Psychoanalystic Therapy,"So far, this book is rather confusing. It is a difficult read but it does give important information for anyone in the mental health field. To fully understand it, one must read it more than once."
1,overwritten rubbish,"Club Dumas was an OK novel but this is several levels below even that. Perez-Reverte has written himself out and has nothing interesting or new to say. The set-ups are dull, the characters are boring and there is absolutely no tension. The adjective ""swashbuckling"" seems to have been used a lot in reviews but I felt myself yawning to sleep over this musketeer. There is no feel for history whatsoever. Vastly overrated."
4,Swashing buckles with the best,"A much lighter touch than some of the novels by Perez-Reverte. I felt like I was reading the word bubbles from a good graphic novel--the word pictures were just fine for coloring in the pictures on the illustrated page.""Swashbuckler: or swasher is a term that emerged in the 16th century and has been used for rough, noisy and boastful swordsmen ever since."" Captain Alatriste, who swashes buckles with the best, is the strong, dark, silent, dangerous type; available for hire for those dirty, nasty bits of business that call for an ex-soldier's deft dirk, dagger, and sword. The Captain's crew of friends and enemies are drawn in colors just as exotic as the Captain. We know we are in for a delicious series of adventures, out of Marvel Comics, inked by Velasquez, told by Master story-teller, Senor Perez-Reverte. Ole!"
2,Forced and predictable,"I really like some of Perez-Reverte's earlier work, but this falls short. It reads like it was well planned; follows adventure formulas, sets up characters for future books, well researched historically. It is technically very well crafted, but lacks a true spark or fire. The characters seemed too much like characters. As if the author was not captured by the fire of a story he wanted to tell, but instead coldly decided it was time to do an swashbuckler and mapped it all out. And there is an annoying amount of poetry laced throughout."
2,More a snoozer than a swashbuckler,"This was a difficult book to get excited about. While I think Perez-Reverte sets the scene of religious/political 17th century Madrid quite nicely and does a good job weaving in historical and fictional threads, the other elements of the book are so unremarkable that the novel isn't able to hold itself together. The characters and plot are stock choices, either the translation or the writing itself is clunky and stumbling, and the narrator is interfering and inconsistant. I understand this is the first in a five book series, which explains away some of the dangling incompleteness (nothing at all happens with two of the ""nemesis"" characters), but I think a finer writer (or editor, perhaps?) could have shaped this novel into a more suitable stand alone volume."
3,Up beat Babs,Not the salutry typical Barbara with this CD. Without question it's Babs and the voice is there.........but not a sit around the fireplace with a glass of wine CD.Having a party ? May I suggest............
1,No flavor at all,"Look carefully at the picture... ""imitation flavor."" More like no flavor. I used the whole bottle (1 Tbls.) in a rather small batch of cookies. It was as if I put nothing in them. Don't bother!"
4,A wonderful production,"I really thought I was buying the 2007 (I believe) production by the Met. The 2007 production is much more a high tech, mystical presentation, but much shortened. You, or at least I couldn't discover the production year in the flyer, but it doesn't matter. The DVD is certainly worth the money. I now know that the 2007 production is not yet available on DVD."
5,AMAZING,"This is a wonderful DVD an all star cast supports it. A superb queen of the night sung by Luciana Serra. A great Zarastro sung by Kurt Möll, adding to the cast Battle and Araiza all et their best. What eklse can you ask? The only negative issue is that the sound is LPCM stereo.Anyway I want to express my deeply confussion about the review of Mateo. I don-t know what DVD he bought but surely was not this production. His comments are not adequate at all for the Met production and less to give only one star. Maybe he has to see more the DVD before write a review like the one he wrote. I reccomend him to buy the 1982 Salzburg Festival production with Cotrubas, Gruberova Schreier and others if he wants to have a treasure."
1,Mozart - Die Zauberflote Kathleen Battle,I was very disappointed because the VHS tape was not in good condition and was truly unviewable. Thepicture wasn't steady . I gave up trying to view it after a short while. Perhaps it might have been a goodperformance if the VHS had been in good condition. I love this opera and was shocked that a VHS wouldbe shipped in this poor condition.
1,No 3D graphic Accelerator Card -- Then don't Buy it,"If you don't have a 3D graphic Accelerator Card, this program won't even work.can't even install it on my home computer, which only has a basic 2D graphic accelerator card.Now will have to buy a 3D card for 200 buck to see this Free screen saver??"
5,Perfect,These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either.
4,Good quality knee sock,These socks hold up well and are perfect for wearing under knee high boots. Very comfortable and reasonably priced
5,My daughters loved them!,Bought these socks for my 4th and 7th graders and they loved them immediately! They are soft AND strong and hold up great in the wash! I will definately buy them again.
4,Great Quality but smaller than wished,"Very nice but a bit snug in the calf and top, but the cotton blend makes for a comfortable feel."
5,Wahl Goatee Trimmer,"This item has made trimming a beard or goatee easy and consistent. It is a good buy, and an excellent product. I recommend it highly."
1,Works great when working,"I am on my 2nd wahl goatee trimmer and yet again it is dead after approx 6 months. When it is working it works well, but this is the second unit I have had that has died within a year. Battery is completely dead, will not recharge. I will look for a different manufacturer this time."
4,"scholarly, perhaps too intellectualized, description","this is a very needed work gathering a great deal of the extant material on the Shakers, their origins, travels, history, contributions and legacy. I highly recommend this scholarly book. My chief criticism is that it is written in, perhaps, too erudite a fashion. It is certainly not geared to the ""average"" reader but it's intent does seem to be toward a more sophisticated audience. I did not care for the repetitive reminder of other Shaker written contributions that the author believes to be too romanticized. All in all, however, this book is very interesting"
5,"Read, Reread, and Repeat","I first read this book when I was ten years old. I was an avid reader in elementary school and certainly could not put it down. I wrote papers on it and did projects about it, and especially enjoyed reading this book time and time again for summer reading. I came back to it numerous times in middle school and was constantly enthralled by the adventures, the stories popular in African culture where the spirit world and the living world come together and meld.I would highly recommend this book to any young reader who wishes to delve into the world of African myticism and feel as if s/he is experiencing the adventures and hardships Nhamo faces."
4,Almost Perfect,"An extremely well-written book from the author of ""The Ear, The Eye and the Arm."" Very Creative and full of adventure. One chapter was a bore which made me change my rating from a five to a four, but hey, nothing's perfect."
1,An total waste of time,"Although I read this book a year or two ago, I recently received it for Christmas and decided to look at the reviews, because frankly, I thought it was a terrible book. First, the main character's family is so superstitious that it seems unrealistic. After she ""causes her sister's infertility,"" she paddles down a river, and frankly, the rest was so boring, I forgot what happens next."
2,Slow-moving,"A girl's book -- boys likely would not relate to the very female nature of this book. Nhamo (whose name means Disaster) lives in the African country of Mozambique in the early 1980s. The native religion and customs of the time will be strange to a youth reader today. Because the spirits tell her family that she is the cause of a cholera epidemic, they send her to be the fourth wife of a cruel man in another town. She runs away, and much of the book consists of her adventures on a boat and on islands in Lake Cabora Bassa.Some of the adventures were a girl-in-jungle version of My Side of the Mountain, but Nhamo's constant communication with various spirits of her religion make the adventure a bit peculiar much of the time. Nhamo also becomes a woman during this voyage, which could make male readers uncomfortable."
4,i need to get this product,"since ive bought the pur system these filters are always needed they""re very expensive and do not last for very long"
5,Cant Believe The Difference,"I live in Queens, NY. The water here is like drinking pool water. I can't believe the taste; so clean & pure. Since I started using Pur water filter system, I stopped buying bottled water. I use it to fill my Keurig coffee pot too. No more carrying cases of water & no more recycling water bottles. Can be costly though so buy it on sale."
3,Thought this was a three-stage filter,"The description didn't say whether this was the three-stage or the two-stage filter (I prefer three), but I guess I should have looked at the picture of the box.White filters are two-stage, blue -- three.Good product overall, at least the taste of the water is.I wish there was a way to check the manufacturer's claims. My major concern is whether it removes over 99% of lead as it claims. My water main is made from lead (house built almost 100 years ago), so I HAVE to filter my water."
1,Caution: This is a WINGLESS Angel.,"After innumerable delays, I finally received this ""collectible"" Angel figure. Do not be misled by the photo depicting it. This Angel HAS NO WINGS. Shame on you, ToyBiz. Shame. Shame."
3,Missing Chemistry,This was my first London book and it was a good read. I thought the H/H worked fairly well together. I liked the seduction part - her coming to him for lessons in exchange for the beastie to save his family. But overall there chemistry was lacking. This could have been much better than it was. I felt like I never really got to know the characters. I never felt draw into the story. The whole book felt like it was leading up to something and then there was nothing. This book was not a page turner or a keeper for me but overall it was ok.I found Griff's and Anna's characters to be a little on the bland side. There seemed to be no spark to either one. And the longing for each other 3/4 of the way through the book I felt was not expressed enough for me to care. I wished London would have delved deeper into her characters to make them more interesting. But overall it was decent.
4,The Christianatheist A MUST READ BOOK !,"As a Christian Author myself - Preparation for Eternity with God, I like to read other books that would expand my knowledge of God's Word especually in Practial Application. I know it takes Conviction, Passion, Experience, Knowledge and much Prayer for Wisdom to make a Christian book a reality.I was very interested in the title - the Christian atheist and was Blessed in reading it.Author and Pastor Craig is a very gifted communicator using his personal experiences to make the Truths of God's Word come alive encouraging Christian babes (atheists) to grow up, get on the [meat] of God's Word and be Mature Christians to Glorify God . I was taken back alittle,cautious a little, but found one of your subjects [ God is not fair] very insightful . My conclusion in this review is - A Must Read, Two thumbs up, 4 Star . Sincerely, Rick M. Streight."
5,Getting honest about your faith,I really got absorbed in this book. Craig is so honest about his Christian journey. That helps me to be more honest with myself in terms of my faith. I realized I have some dangerous weak spots that need to be confronted. I encourage anyone to read this book and realize the masks that the American church so easily wears and doesn't even know it. L.B.
1,Let It Go,"You will only like this type of music in highschool. Once on your own and not sorrounded by whats 'cool' to listen too, u will no longer listen to 20-30 somthings write about the angst they felt when they were in school. Nowadays if you can play bar-chords you can get on a label."
4,good study guide,"I studied for three days using this book and the western civilization section of the official study guide. In this book there were pictures of art and architecture in the exam section that you had to indentify, in the actual clep there were only two that I can remember. Also in the exam section of this book lots of maps to indentify, don't get worried because on the actual clep, picture of the maps were so much better and there were only about three questions. I think if you've taken world history and or art history classes, you would fair well on this exam. I did pass with a score of 65."
2,quite okay,"This book is quite interesting but compared to the others which are realistic, I feel Tintin has a lot of narrow escapes and strangely escapes unhurt in every one of those which are not too realistic. The time he escaped from a sealed off cave through the passage of oil is too lucky and doesn't happen often, considering that Tintin stories are almost believable. Herge's reason for the stoppage of the train that almost killed Tintin, was a very remote one. I still cannot understand how Snowy could talk to Tintin in the beginning."
4,The best place to start to learn about the Revolution,"Excellent primer about the Mexican Revolution. First rate just for the photographs. The Revolution is very complex, and Ms. Brenner at times over simplifies, but that is the point of the book. You will not be disappointed."
2,There are better books on the subject...,"Though Newberg is onto a great idea, it has been better said by others before him. His style is dry and pedantic, his logic poorly constructed."
2,Not a good ending...,"I enjoyed much of the book. It was a great experience to read how people experience religion, ritual. Creation of miths and mysticism's neurological definitions were great. Relations of brain higher, sophisticated regions within themselves and to lower, primitive regions were defined clearly. But the last 2 chapters assumed the existence of God and that's a big shadow on the book. Science does not deal with God. So writers clearly put their personal, subjective experiences in life to a ""scientific"" book. Great beginning, poor ending."
3,Some problems,"Overall, a good device, but some caveats:1). For some reason, you cannot play DTS-encoded audio CD's on this unit. I called Toshiba, and they say this isn't supported. There is no problem with DTS-encoded DVD's, however.2). General TIVO comment: TIVO does not allow a dual input setup using cable directly and a cable box (it does allow the combination of a satellite and analog cable). This is a strange restriction. This configuration is useful under a number of scenarios, especially when the cable box channel switching is unreliable. ReplayTV supports this feature well."
3,"Great as Tivo, not as a DVD player.","If you're looking for an inexpensive Tivo box with all the features, then this product does a great job. If you're lucky, you can find it for as little as $100 after a mail in rebate. The only real problem with this box comes when you try to use the DVD player. It is, apparently, very hit or miss. The unit I purchased worked decently for about a week, and then it would freeze when it reached the second layer of any DVD. A few weeks later, it stopped reading any type of disc other than a DVD, even non-CD-R cd's. Toshiba's customer service was no help - unplugging it for two minutes is not going to help. Now my Tivo is somewhere in Alabama and I'm back to watching commercials while I wait for it to come back..."
5,NOT SINCE RUSSELL OBERLIN HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A VOICE!,"I AM AN OPERA/VOCAL DEVOTEE, I LISTENED TO THIS CD INNUMERAL TIMES SINCE PURCHASING IT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO. I HAVEN'T BEEN EXCITED ABOUT A SINGER SINCE BARTOLI CAME ON THE SCENE. RECENTLY HEARD MR. DANIELS IN THE MET OPERA BROADCAST OF GUILIO CESARE IN WHICH HE SANG SESTO, AND THE HOUSE WENT WILD AFTER EACH ARIA HE SANG. HE IS TRULY PHENOMENAL. LISTENING TO MR. DANIELS EXHILARATES ME RIGHT OUT OF MY SKIN!"
2,"not enough""sticky""","I use this type tape in my jewelry design. The light green color I used before left some sticky residue on my metals that I had to clean off. So I thought this one would be better, well it kinda is, it doesn't leave residue, BUT IT DOESN'T STICK WELL AT ALL."
4,quick delivery,I needed quarter inch tape for some faux painting of a tile application. I could only get it on-line. The shipment arrived quickly and the price was good for the tape. The shipping was a bit high for the item. But they did send a lolipop with the tape (sweet deal.
5,Adventure at its best,"The book may seem ""easy"" at first, but it offers wonderful look into the life of a (forced to be) spy, who through all sorts of adventures during the WWII's Europe basically takes care of himself and through simply being good, takes care of others...to make it more interesting in a way not to harm anyone. I highly recommend the book for being both good, deep look into people's nature in extraordinary circumstances and for some excellent recipes."
2,my thoughts of Words by Heart,"I think that the book ""Words by Heart"" was not a book that I would probally try to get younger readers to read. The reason that I think this is because it is a slow book. The reason that I think this is because there is not a whole lot of action or exciteing things that happen in the book. The book would be a kind of book for a person who likes girl books or books about how it was like to be a little girl growing up. I think that the book also started out with a bad beginning. The reason is because it started out with her going to a spelling bee and how she wanted to win so bad. I figure if you are going to write a book, you want to start out with a good beginning and not start out bad"
2,Words by heart,I am writing my opion on at book called words by heart we just read this book it is called words by heart. I did not like the book at all it was so boring it needed alot of things to be better than it was. some things that it needed was more action in it because it was boring it needed like part of the war in it. This book did not catch me attention very good. I like books with action in them or with fighting in them. When we read another book i hope it is not as boring as this one because this one was boring. Nobody in our class likes it becuase it was so boring so when we another i hope we can atleast read a book with alittle more action in it.
5,Integrity in the Face of Trial,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I was assigned to read it in an adolescent literature class in college and was very unenthused in the first few pages. By the end of the novel, however, I was absorbed in the amazingly well-crafted plot and deeply explored characters. I don't know if young adults can appreciate the complexity of the novel, but I was impressed by Ms. Sebestyen's daring insight into our own response to trial. In the face of all kinds of injustices, we can still be true to our own integrity and rise above."
4,"Great music performance, poor subtitles","One of my favorite operas. The sets were rather spartan, but the music is excellent. My major gripe is with the subtitles in the DVD (and the reason for my 4 star review) - they are very poor. I understand little Russian, and the subtitles appear once every few minutes. At least if they enclosed the libretto with the DVD I would have been able to follow the singing while listening/watching."
5,"Everything, including sets, is absolute perfection!","Aren't we lucky to live in the Age of DVDs? Unlike some other reviewers, the sets contributed mightily to my mesmeration: minimalist, pristine and incredibly beautiful. They artfully enable one to focus on the performances and drama without extraneous distraction. A thrilling experience and a must-have. Plus, DH=hubba hubba!"
5,Love these!,These shoes are quite comfortable. They look great with off white (winter white) and brown pants.
2,Need but no Windows Software,"Product is nice, but only windows drivers and MAC Software are provided. There's no way to locate the Windows Software ""Image Shuttle"". Without this Software, no Pictures can be loaded."
3,How long could YOU go without any?,"This film touches on the American Pie movies, and then goes a bit further. Some would say too far. But however, it's a watchable film, if not really corny at points, with the various bets being put on, and his brother being a priest in training. Who then gets it on with a nun.And his so-called ""friends"" put it on the internet, and he doesn't get just the tiniest bit mad at them? Hello?! And isn't one of his friends Joey's nephew Michael in Joey?The finale of this movie doesn't really answer anything, but the whole film portrays women as being manipulating, which is so not far. It also portrays men as constantly thinking/needing the physical aspect of love - I'm not a man (I think), but I think this also portrays men unfairly.Look out for Josh Harnett doing his best Meg Ryan impression, and the trailer. For some reason, I thought this was the most original trailer I've seen in a long time."
1,I wish I could give this minus 5 stars,"The idea of a guy who wants to go 40 days without sex is good and funny, Josh and the other actors are quite good but the directing is lame. The jokes in this comedy are bad timed and the story development is very predictable.With another director (the people from american pie or road trip for example) it would have been a good movie."
1,Stupid Movie.,This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I can't believe that Josh agreed to do this film. I can't believe I paid so much money to see it. I can't believe I actually sat through the whole thing. Stay away from this one. It's not worth time or money.
3,Nice Little Comedy,40 Days and 40 Nights is a simple funny comedy that one can just go into and enjoy. It's good to see Josh Hartnett in a romantic comedy lead I think he pulls it off. The females in the movie are all sexy but I think the film could have used more T&A from named charcters and not no name girls. One of the funniest scenes inlucdes Hartnett flying through tit clouds. I give *** out of ****.
3,a gift i had to watch,I bought this for a friend who wanted it for her birthday. when it got to me i could not help but open it after i read the back. all i really read on the back that a guy was going to go without sex for 40 days. i was laughing so hard cause i know guys can't do that. so i put it in and really foun the movie quite funny. this poor guy got dumped by this girl he really like and he just wasn't the same woth any other girl afterwords so he decided to go with haveing sex for 40 days thinking it woiuld make him feel better about him whole situation. his friend finds out about it and starts a bet with a lot of people from his work place about what day and how he will finaly break. it was just that every bad sexual thing happened to this guy while he was trying not to do anything. plus this really pretty girl liked him a lot and she was just wanting him so bad. this whole film was unreal but funny in some parts. so i give it one thumb up.
3,40 Days wasn't bad,"This movie was a little bit disapointing when i saw it. People kept on saying how funny it was but i found it sort of boring. The plot was ok and the love story was pretty good but still, It really could have been better. The girl's profession in the story was kind of weird. All in all, this movie was ok..."
5,Great Read!,"I personally have not read the book but I purchased it for a friend how was going through a rough time. She told me she absolutely loved it, and it has helped her to put certain things in her life in perspective."
1,Too bad zero stars cannot be given,This is such tired well refuted ground that I am constantly surprised books like this manage to get published. It is enough to know that nonsense like his only appears in the popular press and not in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Peer-review journals wouldn't touch this garbage. What more do you need to know concerning its validity?
4,Zappa boys rock!,"Few realize what a skilled guitar player Dweezil is, but it is evident here - although only once or twice in that 'big hair' 'whammy bar' '80's band' sort of way. Mostly it is jamming riffs and understated melodic work. Ahmet shows off his talent as a lead man and is quite a good screamer. Together they exhibit a humour which DOES belong in music, to which they owe their father, but they make it all their own with numbers like 'Doodledang' and 'Silver Lady Disco'. Quite funky and rocking -- although obviously a sophmoric basement project with the boys playing most of the instruments. Also a couple of touching numbers about FZ's death."
3,interesting,"First of all, most christian's will not look at this video with an open mind, even as the bible says we must decern truth in all things.Jordan Maxwell is extremely well researched and has connected modern day christianity to astrology and other pagan belief systems of old, thru ancient writings , symbols.he never indicates in the video that there is no god, he only ask's you too keep an open mind, and look at the symbols throughout the history of ancient civilizations, and what they worshiped, and how some of these pagen beliefs have come through and have taken a more political and controlling stance, but its all there for you to decide.it might make you think a little."
5,Like in a class,"This video is really good. It covers the standard 32 postures serie. I fully agree with the previous other reviewers. In addition to more highlight the video, I'd like to say that each movement is repeated 4 times but not just ""copy-paste"" the same sequence, it is really performed 4 different times so that you can notice small differences in different part of the movement that help you to better understand the movement itself. What I also really appreciate is the fact the movements are shown in both front and back view. This is great since the back view puts you in the same condition as in a class (back to the teacher) without haveing the mirror problem. The only point is that I'd have appreciated some application of the movement.In conclusion the video really puts you as in a class. The only limitation is that it can not correct you........"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!,This CD set was terrible. You could get the equivalent by reading from a dictionary and recording yourself. Save your money or buy a higher quality product. (...)
2,not that happy,"did not have a good experience with these. i called my wife at home and although she could hear me fine i could hardly understand what she was saying, transmission very distorted. we tried moving base to different locations and talking in various rooms. nothing worked to improve outgoing clarity. i was very surprised because my research showed that uniden had a great reputation. needless to say i have returned these."
5,Uniden phone,Excellent phone. Easy to program (you hardly have to use the instruction book). Works Great and has many features. Should have bought one a long time ago. I would buy again for sure.
3,"good features, not so good sound","I'm marginally pleased with the new phone. We got it because our old cordless would die after about a half-hour phone call. We don't use the caller ID feature. The sound is definitely hollow, and I was hoping the range would be greater (I can only get 2 houses away, barely). Also, the speed dial function is not as easy as most phones and can't be used when you are talking, so we can't store PIN for calling card. I like the multiple handsets and the ability to program once and send to all phones."
3,Worked for a while...,"I bought 2 sets, The charging cradle of one of the sets stopped charging, in the other set the sound quality is very bad.I thought I was buying quality & insted I got 2 sets that after 1 year might need to be replaced."
1,Can't Use in Kitchen/Tin Can,"Can't use this phone in our kitchen and run appliances like microwave, TV, etc. Called to question Uniden, and they said any cordless phone will interfere with appliances and that none should be used near any (???). Whatever. This phone sucks. Sounds tinny, and many people tell me they have trouble hearing me. I would not purchase this if I had to do it over again - total waste of money and nerves. Still unplugging and plugging back in to watch TV, etc."
4,Saturn story,"I'm an avid reader of the history of the US space program, but most of the books I've read are more journalistic; written for a more general audience. I'm really not a technical person (liberal arts guy). I was a little pensive about ""a technological history"", but figured I'd give it a shot anyway. I'm about halfway through and am holding up pretty well--actually enjoying it quite a bit. My familiarity with the broader history has been very beneficial.Someone else commented on the images. I agree that those could be better--better size and quality and generally a better complement to the text."
4,ladies to the recue,"from the opening riff of ""i cant lose"" to ""brick"" this cd rocks with the best of any cd male or female. a great live performer debbies style of playing is a cross between stevie ray vaughan and hednrix"
5,Just like being there!,"One day last summer I stole a CD from my girlfriend that contained the song ""Crazy Game of Poker"" by O.A.R. I immediately fell in love with the song and decided to purchase one of O.A.R.'s albums....ever since I have been hooked. This 2 CD set is by far their best work yet. The songs sound absolutely amazing, almost as if you were watching the band live. My favorites are ""Hey Girl"", ""Black Rock"", and ""About Mr. Brown""....but every song is great. A must have for any O.A.R. fan, or anyone looking to spice up their music collection."
2,Arrrrgghh,"Aarrrrrghh... I bought this CD because I've been hearing about these guys here and there. They were at Bonnaroo (thankfully I went to North Mississippi Allstars during that time-slot instead) and they are playing this weekend in Denver so I wanted to see what the buzz was about and possibly buy tickets.I really don't understand why so many people like this band. Bland, boring and unoriginal. They sound like a lesser version of Dave Matthews Band (I don't consider DMB a jam band either.) I guess it's OK for high-school and college parties as back-ground music, but if you are a music lover looking for a good jam band with an original sound, skip O.A.R."
1,Very sub-standard Wilbur Smith Lite,"The only good thing in this movie is Jolene Blalock as a femme fetale. The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows."
2,Buyer beware,Let me make this absolutely clear - I am not a Mikis fan but I'm not speaking to the Mikis fans out there I'm speaking to the Serpico fans and offering a word of warning. I think the Serpico soundtrack is just fantastic. It was one of my first records and some of the tracks from Serpico drift into my head even after all these years but I could never find just the Serpico soundtrack on disc so after years of procrastination I decided to bite the bullet and buy this 2CD set. What a disappointment. The production is muddy and the other three soundtracks featured are nothing like Serpico in style. They aren't totally without merit but if it's just Serpico you're after then look elsewhere.

3,The Little Show That Could!,"This pretty little musical finally closed after umpteen years off Broadway, but will always live on in dinner theatres and regional productions. It's terribly sweet and deservedly a classic. This particular recording, however, doesn't do justice to the original recording, largely as a result of the casting. Nouveau political correctness and strange sounding young leads leave this version coming up short. Stick with the original and, for a treat, check out the straight-to-video FANTASTICKS film with a divine Luisa!"
1,just found out,"it is sold for less than $3 in the supermarket, but here, more than $11?! just found out about it a few days ago. people don't make the same mistake in the future"
1,Unreliable,"We bought two sets of these for a family room remodel. One of the lights was dead upon arrival. Changing parts showed it was in the fixture, not the bulb. After 3 1/2 months the ""electronic transformer"" in the other set failed. I contacted Kovacs, and they offered me the opportunity to buy a new one from one of their dealers for $62 plus shipping. Oh, by the way, the design had changed--with the same model number--so it wouldn't match the other.A nice looking product, but not designed to actually work."
1,doors are not black,"The product I wanted was the bdb36b, which are black in color. They sent me bdb36bb, which are brushed brass. This is actually specified in small print somewhere in the ad, but I didn't see it, and the product was sold under the wrong item number. I was refunded the purchase price, but am out $40.00 in shipping charges. When I went to a local retailer, they had the correct item in stock, for $50 more. I will never deal with this company again, and will read all the fine print on anything from Amazon, if I ever deal with them again."
4,A definite page turner...,"Okay, I couldn't put it down. I found myself nodding my head in recognition of the concepts and insights Swerdlow referred to. I found myself, also, wishing he were a better writer, able to delve into descriptions and details better. Vague references to events and personalities appear to be written for those ""in the know,"" which, in some way, makes sense. This book isn't for everyone. I ""get"" it -- not everyone will.It's a book I had been looking for, without knowing it. It pulls a lot of pieces together, and yet leaves me wanting more. I felt validated in my own perceptions by someone I don't even know, have never even met. If that's the kind of reading you are looking for, this is the book for you. It opens the door to an explanation of the events happening in our world today that were not happening when the book was written -- at least until the Appendix.If the world today doesn't make sense to you, give Swerdlow a try. He seems to know something important."
4,Berlin Living Room Music,"This CD was given to me by a friend visiting from Germany, and I instantly loved the electro ballads it contained. Mellow, analog electro-pop at its best, it's got the Ladytron or Adult feel with a softer edge. Highly recommended."
1,A great star's biographer deserves no stars,"I read this book from cover to cover shocked that such an excellent writer could so suffuse himself into his work that he overshadows his subject, Katharine Hepburn. Unless you want to read about this author's contacts with the rich and famous, skip this book. The author has written his own bio. He obviously thinks that we will find his life more interesting than that of Miss Hepburn's. If ever he even thinks of writing another bio, he should make sure it is of someome whom he has never met. That way, he won't think he's so important."
3,"Berg Remembered, Kate Marginalized","This is a well-written book, full of reminiscences about the life of the remarkable Katharine Hepburn, who, as the author has written, is the defining actor of the 20th century. Berg is clearly the doting author, and he writes about Hepburn's extraordinary intellect, talent and life with compassion and adoration. Berg is honest that this book is not a biography because he lacks objectivity about Hepburn, which of course, is the most important prerequisite of a biographer. However, I have to agree with those reviewers who question his motives. Indeed, I find it ironic that he so unamiguously impugns Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty for their desire to use Hepburn for their own selfish ends, yet he spares himself this judgment. At the end of this book, one feels that Hepburn is forced into the wings, while Berg takes center stage."
2,choose another book,"If you want the definative KH book, this is not it. Berg inserted himself into this woman's life as a fawning, unobjective (granted, he concedes the point) fan posing as a biographer. Read th ememoir Tracy and Hepburn by Garson Kanin- the man Berg refers to quite harshly in his book (professional jealousy?).. Kanin knew his book was a loving reminiscence and it is quite fascinating without being fawning or cloying. Ms. Hepburn knew exactly what she was doing. Too bad Berg didn't."
3,not really fireworks,"Stan the Man, the greastest sax player of all time should have made a number of albums with Jeru - the best baritone of all time (since his better playing mentor Serge Chaloff died off young). Both were Cool both West Coast Jazz. The owner of Verve put them together. But there is only this one.In order to fool the listener, they switch instuments at one point! Getz plays baritone and Mulligan plays tenor. They should have made great music togehter but the results are adequate but don't live up to what each of the Cool Jazz greats did on other albums where they were out front. The Getz and Bill Evans albums are also pretty mediocre. Maybe too many egos?The best series of duet albums Getz did (other than piano with Al Haig or Kenny Barrons) was with Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone.Why this one is adequate but not great (as is stated elsewhere), it's hard to say."
3,Don't switch horns,"Getz and Mulligan were obvious heavyweight jazz musicians, but this recording falls way short of other efforts during this period in their careers. Although switching horns may have brought some interest to the session, the results are not positive, and in the end just a bad idea. Mulligan's tone on tenor is particularly strident and his intonation is poor, and after hearing Getz's sweat tone and precise technique on tenor, Mulligan just sounds lousy on tenor, especially in the upper range of the horn. Getz pulls the horn switch off more convincingly and plays the Bari with some authority and retains his voice, but the question in the end is why? There are some nice moments and obvious skilled improvisation and technical prowess on this recording, but the recording is not a high point."
5,Be afraid,"Really good book. Real stuff , makes you think about what's going on with people and society.The author keeps your interest, but the characters here are the real interesting point. I'm actually kind of afraid after I've read this."
5,simply buttah,"J-Dilla has done it again! This is truly a work of art. This is a great easy listener, a cd that you can listen to straight thru without having to skip over any tracks. Of course I have several favorites but I truly enjoy all the tracks and the album as a whole. This is a must have for your collection."
5,Musical treasures to keep in mind!,"Jorge Mester at front of the Louisville Orchestra developed a true artistic feat, even making known pages practically unperformed of the Latin American repertoire.His version of Ollantay for instance owns that mysterious ambiance and idiomatic distinctness that always has characterized it. It has vivid moments, bravura passages and that marvellous poetry, so rich in textures and harmonies. Tinged by Indian melodies and folk songs, this page might be regarded as the most representative and important symphonic work of this talented composer.The flawless intonation, smart intonations and phrasing clearness deserve a special place among the most and original conductors of this musical period, where the airs of musical renovation made the whole world turned its attention into Latin American musical expressions."
3,A rip off,i can get the guide free with the game at sams club. there's a buch of typos in it i bet just like all the guides prima makes
4,Bundled surprise,"When I purchased an Epson LCD projector, the CX6400 came as a bonus. What a piece of luck. It is a great home copier. Goodbye Kinko's. It also makes fast B&W copies and good color copies. I had not previously considered buying a multipurpose machine, believing that it would many things poorly. The CX6400 does them all well."
2,It's the INK stupid...,"I really liked this all-in-one BUT it's costing me a fortune in ink. I've owned two other printers before and both were ""lesser models"" that gave me more for my money - this eats up ink like it's the hungry tree in Little Shop of Horrors, and each cartridge (there are four) is between $25 and $33 and to choose only ""black ink"" requires two extra steps every single print job. I can't believe the issue isn't the hardware - that it's the INK that makes this purchase a major regret!!!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I bought the CX6400 a year ago for my small business, an investment at the time, or so I thought. Fourteen months later, I am in the market to replace it. No reason, it just stopped printing. Epson politely offered to fix it for free, and I will have it back in about a month. A small business, a month? Do yourself a favor, keep looking and DO NOT purchase the CX6400!! My next printer will certainly not be an Epson."
2,2 year Printer :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(,"i have to agree with some of the other reviews. This printer just died yesterday. It was a great printer, did everything i wanted to do, but just be papered to replace it.I looked at other Epson printers, and the same type of issue. I am done with epson and going with a HP 5180 and hook it up to my wireless router"
2,Next!!!,"Don't buy this printer. It was great for sometime but definitely not long term printer. I've had for about 2 years and I don't really print/copy all that often. A few months ago, I noticed that the ink started to smear and colors started to look very different than what was on my computer screen. Then a few weeks ago, it completely died. Everything was faint. I ran all of the diagnostics but to no avail. Save your money for something else."
5,Highly Recommended,"Raymo's book is powerful, transporting, humorous and sad all at once. After reading this work, I understand the difference between language and prose.The novel is historical, scientific, human and mythic, budled into a page turning compact work.Fantastic."
5,Absolutely sweet.,This story is one of the cutest I have seen. Very few words but the pictures tell the story. Lilly and Willy are so very adorable and both of my sons grew up looking at these books and loving every minute of them.
3,The prolog about Walter Starr is amazing.,The problem with this guide is it was written in the 30's and the trailhead info is not totally reliable. For hardcore JMT fans this is a must-read.

2,A disapointment for those looking for inspirational music.,"Although this recording is featured in Christian music clubs and book stores, you will wonder why after a quick read of the lyrics. Nothing offensive here, but nothing inspirational either."
3,Four novellas featuring the same wagon train --,"This book contains four separate stories about people on a wagon train heading for Oregon. The style of each author is different, but each includes characters from the other stories. This gives the total book some continuity. However, the shortness of each story was frustrating to me and would have rated higher if expounded upon and made into four complete books. Although the last story was my favorite, there was a bit too much drama and all four short stories were much too predictable. More suspense would have proved interesting and would raise my stars ratings."
4,Haven't Had Time to Read this Book,I haven't read this book yet but other books by Cathy Marie Hake have been wonderful reads and I expect this book will be no different from the others I've read from this author.
3,Upbeat & Interesting,"Brent Lewis's music is very upbeat and interesting. I prefer his disc, ""The Primitive Truth,"" which is much more focused on percussion than this disc, which utilizes more electronic instrumentation than I prefer. It's still a good disc, I'm just really into percussion and I was hoping that this disc was more like The Primitive Truth."
4,Good practical primer,"Sound, practical advice on the basics of getting syndicated. Especially useful for people who have no clue where to even begin."
3,If you have to have it...,"I bought it because some of my younger (voice) students loved the movie and wanted to sing the songs. I never really got into the movie but I must admit the music is kinda nuts (in a good way). Sally's Song is beautiful, but for the most part, the music is too insane for me to play while teaching, so I think I'll look for a Karaoke CD somewhere."
5,Best. Chair. Ever.,"Head rest, foot rest, drink holder. This chair is great; and it folds up nicely/easily when its time to pack up and go home. I've had mine for 3+ years and it is still in great shape. Its very comfortable, supportive and well built. People on the beach are always jealous of my foot rest! The only con is it is a bit heavy to carry - but an able-bodied person can easily manage."
5,One of the funniest cd's I own,I am a big fan of stand up comedy and this is stand up at it's best. The boys come up with some of the funniest pot related material you will ever hear! A must own for fans of pot and comedy!
4,Soup is good,"The soup is very good soup, the noodle consistency is excellent but it is a bit too salty. The flavor packet should have more dried spinach, kale, seaweed and dried veggies to make it more a more hearty meal."
2,Dont be fool...,Read the reviews for the Black model. There are more negative comments then the positive one.
5,"Spectacular western swing band, and a purrfect cd...","This cd is in every way a winner! this band instrumentall ysounds similar to Big Sandy's western swing combos, but much less corny and much more authentic, and the lead singer here is marvelous. This cd recalls the 1950's Bob Wills, with some rockabilly aestetics. A great cd for cruisin' your hot rod, or dancin' the bop! ESSENTIAL for fans of modern day rockabilly and wetsern swing. One of the best rivial bands, and best cd releases of today, in the rockabilly genere."
4,What if?,"This book is easily replaced by internet sites as mentioned on an earlier review. Yet, what if there is no internet. Consider how many reloaders keep a computer at their reload bench and you will realize the necessity of this book. And, there is the worse case scenario of a major disaster that might render the internet down for an extended time."
3,"It's a nice, sold book","A nice solid book, but doesn't really cover how exactly to reload. But, I don't think any of the reloading books do. Has lots of tables and interesting articles."
2,Taints veggies with strange taste,"So much easier to clean than the old metal one we had, but we had to throw out the first three batches of veggies we steamed with it because they had an awful taste...makes you wonder what is leaching out of the product to taint the food....I'm almost afraid to keep trying with it...even though it seems that the funny taste is fading."
4,"Excellent bra, bigger than expected","I bought 2 of these bras in white and soft taupe, they are good quality but they are bigger than I expected, I am normally size 38 DDD in other brand, and this wire-free were to small so I thought buying the 40 DDD would be ok, well, I was wrong they are one number bigger than my size, I will ahve to stick with them to avoid all headaches of shipping them back. I recomment to buy but be careful, you need to know your exact size if not you will get a surprise."
2,minimizer bra,It looks nice but it does not hold the breast enough. It might minimize the size of the breast but all goes out of it. So for large breast it does not do its job
1,Gets 5 stars in gore/ disturbing aspects,"I would have given this film 5 stars in the departments of gore and uneasiness, but i hate this movie. I own a copy and feel like i need to get rid of it as soon as possible.(watched it twice to get a full spectrum of it) Ive watched alot of EFFED up films from plain gore to psychological terror (ex: Flower of Flesh and Blood, Tumbling Doll of Flesh, Serbian Film, Men Behind the Sun...many others), but this one ABSOLUTELY takes the cake in making you feel guilty for even watching it. Its a german film with VERY little dialogue at all (oddly enough they speak english). But the special effects (at least i THINK they are FX)...are very very convincing in terms of looking realistic. The castration scene is the crescendo of NASTY in this movie. I urge you not to even bother picking this one up, but if you want a SICK and cheap thrill for your own twisted, guilty pleasures....BON APETITE...and oh yeah...its based on a true story. yuck"
5,"Fine, fine, fine.","Bennie and Tommy are the real deal. They just play and it's there. No pyrotechnics, just real fine emotional performance."
1,Weak Springs,The product description was for a heavy duty spring. I would hate to see the lighter spring. Ended up not using ait and pluging hole.
5,Great good,Very well written; easy to follow. I recommend it strongly. Nice graphics and explanations. Worth it for back packers. Done.
5,i love vendetta red,i just found out about vendetta red like a couple months ago. But i all ready think that there the best band ever. I met them and there really cool people also. This cd is awesome!!!! adn if you liked the cd wait till you see them live it is a real treat.
5,A Profound Study,"More than any other differentiated group of people, African Americans have moved.The first section of this book, covers 1450 to 1865. In this period, large numbers of slaves were transported from Africa to America. This book covers this part of our time in great detail including both transportation, runaways, and the domestic slave trade.After the Civil War, the freed-slaves began their own migration away from the south to the northern and western states.There were two great migrations from the south to the industrial north during World War I and World War II.Finally since 1970 there have been migrations from the Caribbean areas and from Africa. Many of the immigrants from Africa came to the United States for college and did not return to Africa. There has also been a migration returning to the south.Each of these migrations is described in detail and the implications analyzed. The book is published by the National Geographic, and as you would guess, profusely illustrated."
5,Perhaps the best commentary on Acts available,"Hahn & Mitch have done another fantastic job. They take the data of the biblical book, break down for the modern reader what's happening, how it relates to what's going on before and after, and gives us the theological significance besides.I love all the Ignatius Bible Study commentaries. As a group there is no modern commentary series that is its equal. They have the depth necessary for scholars looking for an accessible resource and the straight forward approach that American readers long for.They do an excellent job in particular demonstrating the parallels between the ministries of Peter and Paul while these two carry out the ministry of Jesus in word and deed."
1,Not really a study bible .,"Typical Catholic inability to offer its faithful a ""real"" opportunity to study scripture. Questions at the end lack depth for real discussion. Overpriced and disappointing. I am a practicing Catholic who is tired of the inability of the ""scholarly"" hierarchy to offer us a real encounter with the Scriptures. Yes, I know there are references to the cathechism to guide us etc., but really........................"
2,You get what you pay for.,"Like the song says.....I shoulda known better........ The Boca 12 string is indeed attractive with a nice sound. The main problem I encounter is the constant tuning required after every other song I play. It's my first 12 string, & I thought I'd done my research when I dove in to buy it. Guess when you purchase a $300.guitar, you should expect some shortcomings. I still plan to keep it to mess around with at home, but I would not take it to any gigs or shows for fear it wil not hold its tuning long enough for more than 3 straight songs."
2,kids guitar,"I am very unhappy with this little guitar - even though it is very pretty. As soon as I tune it, it immediately loses its tune, so it is impossible for my daughter to play anything that sounds good on it. It is also very difficult to tune, because the pegs do not turn well. I have a guitar playing friend who said that the strings might stretch out eventually and it should hold a tune better then, but I don't have much hope for that. I had another friend who suggested that I invest in a highter quality set of tuning pegs (about $15) I might do that.I was hoping to purchase this cheaper guitar and find out if my daughter likes it before purchasing a more expensive one, but since she can't play anything on it, there is no way to find that out!"
4,A Brilliant Novel About Life In The Show-Business Fast Lane.,"I think that Jackie Collins and Rona Jaffe are two of the best writers around since they can create characters who you see so much of yourselves in.In the Fame Game, you actually thought you were an invisible person actually seeing how people rise to the top and the high price that they pay with sex, drugs, and alcohol. From Sam Leo Libra's brilliant marketing campaigns to the calm efficiency that Gerry Thompson, his secretary provided for the clients, the action never lags.You sympathized with all the characters from ""Bonnie Parker"" after being told her career was over as a model to the animosity when Silky Morgan, of Silky and the Satins goes from being the lead singer to the diamond in the rough star much to the anger of her four singing partners, you see that the people who seem to have everything don't always have everything. A fascinating novel."
2,Secrets of the lost cavern,"This game its a diferent kind of piece of entertainment than i thought, i was expecting something less complicated, more as the way of prehistoric cultures. More fun, with a bit more action and larger scenes. Perhaps is just that is not my kinda of games."
2,Unpleasantly Surprised,"I am a serious gamer of many genres and have played and enjoyed other Dreamcatcher games. This one was just an exercise in frustration. The movement was clumsy, choppy and bulky -- I have 2gig ram and an AMD 3200 with an Nvidea 7300, so it is not my computer.This game was so clumsy in fact, that I began to feel the real puzzle was just figuring out how to move around. The graphics were simply OK. The story was terribly uninteresting and quite frankily I quit playing because I just did not care anymore. Bottom line: I should have known it was too good to be true for under 20$"
1,Stuck in a cave again.,"A game that has as your first exciting task rubbing two sticks together to make fire is not even worthy of a cub-scout. I'm really getting tired with games that leave you in one spot without even the slightest hint of what you should next to move the game along. Of course one figures it out eventually, but what a waste of time!The science and history trivia were not interesting, and not informative of the game itself."
3,Extremely Technical Language,"Reading this book is like talking to a Doctor or having to learn a new language ---- and I'm no dummy. I'm a college graduate, locksmith, Technical writer, 38 years as an operator, Supervisor, Safety Engineer in the Oil Industry, a Paralegal, and have graduated from Private Investigator training. I will come back to this booklet later, but have ordered more basic archery reading to go over first. ""Tuning your Compound Bow"" is written as if everyone in the world knows exactly what he is talking about. I dislike very much when people don't use language that the beginners would understand. I'm 67 years old, retired, and just want to get back into target shooting archery."
5,confidence wedge set,"These are very nice clubs. For the money, they can't be beat! The metal finish on the club head may not be as pretty as more expensive models. These clubs have the nastiest jobs in the golf bag. Why do they need to be pretty? For my money, these were an awesome pick!"
3,Wedges,So far they are ok. I needed a set of wedges for a second set that I use maybe 10 times a year. They the a bit heavier than I'm used to and I need to make sure that I take a full swing with them to get my normal distances Wouldn't use them as my everyday wedges but for the price they fit my need
5,Good clubs,"I have been playing golf for three months now. Asked for these for Father's Day. Very easy to hit,specially the 52 degree due to the low bounce on it. The 56 gets me out of the sand very easy. The 60 works well also. Nice grips, good looks, and excellent feel. Great price of course."
1,justwanttomakesure,"Hi when I buy this books I ask Amazon to ship them to an inmate, some of the books never made it and communication is difficult with detainees in prision...so I don't know how to review these books I buy...I just want to make sure they deliver the books to the specific inmate.Thanks"
4,Great but Rather Fragile,"This is a great notebook stand. It has got many ports, well located. The manufacturer has another model with a fan to ventilate its back which I think is the only thing missing in this product. It would be more complete if besides the audio ports and all the others it also cooled the computer. But that is only a plus because overall the design helps ventilate. The only thing which disappointed me is the fragility of the front holder, the piece which prevents the notebook from sliding down. It is a very weak piece and the manufacturer should re-engineer that. I really feel like that any time i remove and place back the computer i might break it."
3,Voice of the gods,"Deva Premal's voice reminds me of honey, I could listen to her over and over again and the effect of this brings a profound joy. To compare Love is Space to her other albums, it's not quite as good as Dakshina, and better than The Essence. I reccommend this to any fan of Deva Primal, or to anyone who needs to be uplifted."
3,Good music - bad mastering,"These are a couple of Nascimbene's best International scores, presented in low fidelity monaural. It's particularly annoying in that A FAREWELL TO ARMS was presented in theaters in stereophonic sound. This particular recording may have archival value to collectors, but hopefully better sound elements survive elsewhere for a re-release."
3,A little on the light side,"The duffle bag looked like the photo, but it was a little lighter weight than I had hoped. The zipper arrangement on top is in a square pattern, which makes retrieving items a bit cumbersome since the bag doesn't open up totally. It will probably work better when items are just stuffed in and pulled out at random."
3,Rare Middle Ground,"The documentary is OK...a lot less Penn Gillette would have been nice...but your response to the movie is going to be determined by what you think of the band and its music...whether you like the music or see it all as a big hipster joke of some kind.I think what the people who have such a negative response don't grasp is how much the critics interviewed respond to the emotional purity of Half Japanese. Let's face it, the idea that rock'n'roll is about transcendent poetry and musicianship has always been and (God willing) will always be absurd. Rock'n'roll is about emotion, and bands like Half Japanese get much closer than most mainstream bands to expressing emotion in an unfettered way.I think it's disingenuous to say that Jad Fair can't ""write"" lyrics, but other than that, I'll concede that not everything is for everyone. Tastes differ. I don't think that makes anyone really smart or really stupid though. It's just a matter of taste. We'd all do well to keep that in mind."
3,Not as good as the original,"While I applaud the inclusion of the full movie score here (the previously-missing ""Organic"" was always one of my favorites) and the performance is note-for-note accurate (as should be expected), I am disappointed by the certain aspects of this re-recording. First off, the record level is unusually low, but most importantly, the performance is not near as ""punchy"" as the original. The organs and keyboards are much, much softer than they were in the original recording. We're left with a much softer version of the score, that doesn't have the ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" feel of the original.In the end, I eagerly await Koyaanisqatsi to be released on DVD, hopefully with the original score intact and remastered."
4,a reccomendation.,"First of all let me make the disclaimer that I do not own the original score which is referred to in some of the other reviews. That said, I cannot tell the difference between this recording and my memory of the film from 5 days ago, the first time I saw it.Although some say it lacks a certain edge, and I am at a loss to draw an informed comparison, listening to this without the first one is by no means a dissapointment. The last few minutes of ""Resources"" has a chafing strength, and that familiar opening chant is just as foreboding as it was the first time I heard it.Someone who's really crazy about this music will probably need to buy both editions, as the fuller version of ""Grid"" on this recording alone necessitates that.I enjoy listening to this cd; it is unique among the Glass compositions that I have, although it is not my favorite (I like the Violin Concerto and Facades, currently)."
5,The movie is on telly soon!,"But only on C4 in the UK - so if you live here or wish you knew someone who did, it's on Sun 7th Jan 2001 at 03:05 GMT."
3,Fogged Glass,"Like the re-recording of ""Einstein on the Beach"", this take-two files off the rough edges of the original - as if Glass's increased respectability over the intervening years requires that the musicians play more reverentially. The trumpets in this ""Cloudscapes"" are just *dull* - like they were spliced in from a bargain-price plod though one of Mozart's more routine symphonies. And the bland harmonizing of the chorus in ""Vessels"" could go straight into a Beach Boys record. Even half of the real thing - which is what the original ""Koyaanisqatsi"" soundtrack provides, more or less - will be more musically filling than this almost full helping of the Diet version."
1,"No longer necessary, thank goodness","As I write, Koyaanisqatsi is available on DVD. On the DVD, the soundtrack is uncut--so why would you buy the cut CD version with lower sound quality, when the DVD with 48kHz 5.1 surround sound is available for less?Even before the DVD was released, I never liked the CD abrigements as they left out my favorite bits. I bought the CD, but ended up listening to a tape of the soundtrack from the HiFi VHS release in preference!"
2,music intended to portray spiritual death,"I saw KOYAANISQATSI when it was first released in 1983 at a special showing outdoors at the Petrillo Bandshell in Grant Park in Chicago. It was a powerful experience, with the city skyline for a backdrop. I well recall my feeling at the time, that the images were provocative and moving, but the music was intensely annoying. I WANT to like it. I fully sympathize with the message of the film, which is that our ""civilization"" is out of balance with ""nature."" I absolutely believe that we need nothing less than an ecological revolution before we destroy any more of the planet. Compassion for all sentient beings! But after repeated listening, I find the soundtrack to be yet another symptom of our out-of-sync society. I have the same reaction to most of Glass's music.If you are interested in minimalism, I recommendTerry Riley's IN CandSteve Reich's MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS(see my reviews of both). These are works of beauty that may be part of the cure.Namasthe!"
1,Pretty Horrible Dictionary,"This dictionary sucks and thats why I'm actually writing a review so I can rant about it. I'd advise strongly not to get it. My Chinese is decent and this dictionary translates English to chinese pretty bad. An example, is their translation of giraffe isn't the normal Chinese work for it. So stay away from this book."
5,Insightful and real,"What I know about combat corpsmen I learned from Greg Mcpartlin. It's not realistic, it is real. I thought I'd see blood drip from the pages. We who have not experienced combat cannot empathise with terror and confusion but Greg takes us as close as we'll ever get to through the emotions that he projects. A great experience and a wonderful read."
3,No big deal,"Thought it would highly increase the iPod experience, but sound quality is not even better than standard iPod earphones. Already sold them."
2,Dont waste your money,this product stinks. The buds didnt stay in my ears. The plug that connects to the ipod didnt stay securley fastened. This product is worthless in my opionion.
1,Hate it for me but you could love it.,Watch seemed perfectly fine. Just be prepaired for a watch so large it doesnt fit under your shirt sleeve. If you like really big watches this ones for you.
4,good music,"John Coltrane was one of jazz's top instrumentalists along with dolphy and charlie parker, and this is a good example. Speaking of Dolphy, check out his album 'out to lunch' also Frank Zappa's Hot Rats. thanks."
1,Extende versions or The King Biscuit?,The truth is that this is just a rehash of the King Biscuit Live recording - minus a couple of tracks. It is taken from the same source.
4,Sometimes its bitter sometimes its sweet,"I love this album, I really do.The onyl reason I deducted one star was for the three songs I just dont like, the top one being Cocaine Lane..Girl is brave, the vocal runs she attempts almost head for disaster but somehow she pulls threw and comes off as quite skilled. I love Strawberrys,Aint Nothin Changed,Heaven, and boy next door. I however know that this is nto an album for everyone.Myself however, loves it"
4,Im a art teacher and also a mother...,And this book is a excellent resource for using the Montessori method in your home. They go step by step with you and also have easy to follow instruction for all parents!!!
2,I disagree,I looked for help in this book and instead received a bunch of sappy sayings and superficial nonsense.
4,"Thought I was getting original stories, but alas....","Finding Home contains three stories, Duncan's Bride by Linda Howard (1990); Chain Lightning by Elizabeth Lowell (1999) and Popcorn and Kisses by Kasey Michaels. Of the three stories, Chain Lightning was my favorite. I had already read Duncan's Bride and prefer Linda Howard's more recent offerings, although the ascerbic waitress character tickled me. Popcorn and Kisses was light-hearted fun reading but a tad formulistic. Chain Lightning by Elizabeth Lowell grabbed my attention and never let go. I felt as though I were on an island and I didn't want to leave. This is the first book I've read by Elizabeth Lowell but it won't be the last!"
4,phone battery,I didn't get a chance to use it. The phone was no good so I have a battery that I can't use.
4,Review Is Actually of the CD - An Excellent Recording,"The Sabri Brothers, who hail from Pakistan, perform the qawwali music of the Islamic Sufi tradition in arrangements both traditional and modern. This is intense music that typically consists of a lead singer, a backing vocal group that follows his lead in call and response fashion, and accompaniment on the harmonium and a variety of rhythm instruments. The songs are sung in Arabic, but liner notes included with this CD containing English translations that expose the religious nature of this intense, hypnotic music. No, this is not music for everyone, but all I can say is that if you like the energy of Pearl Jam, then you ought to love the Sabri Brothers, who sing rings around Eddie Vedder in songs that make a lot more sense."
5,"Buy, read and give this book","Most answers to complex problems are incredibly simply. I think we know this, but we get our heads buried in the sand pretty quickly. Bill Rich's book is like a gentle nudge from a friendly sheepdog, helping us find our way back.The author's love of 'just being here' is contagious. Whether Catholic, Christian or Human, this book will lift some of the weight.This is NOT a self help book. It does NOT contain directions. It does NOT require the purchase of any kind of clothing or equipment.It's good words, well written. The worst that could happen is you might feel better."
2,uh huh...,"well, like a lot of people i heard ""christmas cannon"" played over the radio and i loved it so much i had to buy the cd. i'm sorry i did. And i actually don't mind the songs. what bugs me though is the lead males voice. it's painful to listen to him because he is so bad. if you like christmas cannon just download that song. the rest isn't worth it."
3,get Christmas Eve and Other Stories instead!,"The high point of this album is the in-your-face version of ""Deck the Halls."" Its biggest flaw, in comparison with ""Christmas Eve"" (which was great) is that it's BLEAK. There just doesn't seem to be as much hope or affirmation in the lyrics, and the music is more repetitive and less original."
2,"A dissappointment after ""CHRISTMAS EVE AND OTHER STORIES""!","I bought this album on the strength of the excellence of their previous album ""CHRISTMAS EVE AND OTHER STORIES"" - BIG MISTAKE!. I wish I had had the opportunity to listen to it somewhere first. It contains too much of what I consider incompatible vocals. Even the instrumental selections weren't up to quality of the other album. I think I might have liked this one better if I hadn't heard the other one first. I will probably buy other T-SO albums but, next time, will first want to hear a few of the tracks."
5,TSO rocks my world anytime of the year,TSO is probably the best classical era rock group out there. They are pure genious with their electric violins and beautiful medleys:) I have all four albums and I recommend them to all people of all ages.
5,Trans-Siberian Orchestra is great but Savatage is better,"Trans-Siberian Orchestra is a side-band of a band called Savatage. If you like Trans-Siberian Orchestra I highly suggest that you check out Savatage. Savatage's ""Dead Winter Dead"" and ""The Wake of Magellan"" cds are pure masterpieces. They are much better then the Trans-Siberian Orchestra cds in my opinion."
1,"Glad for Amazon's ""Song Sampler's""","I heard ""Christmas Canon"" on the radio and loved it so I thought I would buy the CD. When I heard the sound tracks, though, I changed my mind."
3,Not what I expected,I don't know how you can rate music but I obviously didn't know what I was ordering when I purchased this album. I wanted it because of the Christmas Canon and so I assumed the rest of the album would be in keeping with that song. It is not at all and it's just not what I was hoping for. I should have previewed the songs. My fault of course.
5,One of the best,"It's always invaluable to hear cabaret artists in a live setting, and this set from the Carlyle showcases the talents of Barbara Carroll to indelible effect. Miss Carroll's treatments of the best of the popular songbook are beautifully structured; she can swing with the best, her bop-inspired piano rapping out great excursions through ""The Surrey with the Fringe"" and ""But Not For Me"". When she slows down, she can turn an instrumental like ""Lotus Blossom"" into a ruminative, wistful tone poem.Also listen to her understated vocals on a late-night classic like ""Glad to be Unhappy"", where every nuance of Lorenz Hart's lyric is perfectly communicated. She also does justice to a Coleman and Leigh song, ""A Moment of Madness"", the bittersweet lyric perfectly matching her wry songspiel.Barbara Carroll is one of those rare performers with whom quality is a given: her repertoire is fresh and stimulating, her musicianship exquisite. Do yourself and favour and listen to her."
3,Plastic body does not resemble the part photograph. Thought the,The plastic body does not reflect the photo of the part. The plastic thickness between the couplers is thinner than shown in the photo.
3,Decent Compilation. Not my favorite.,"I've heard a few live versions of this song and it is one of my favorites. I have not heard this song in a recording until I received this CD. Expecting primarily vocal renditions based on the CD title, I was disappointed to find so many instrumentals (technically ""Londonderry Air""). I was surprised to find that none of these renditions were exceptionally enjoyable for me.I have rated it ""3 stars"" as Amazon describes that rating as ""It's OK"". There are some quite good instrumentals, however I will probably sell this CD and seek some recorded vocal versions that I prefer.-Chris"
1,What a waste of time.,"I couldn't convince myself to finish this book. I've rarely abandoned a book, but I deleted this one off my kindle because its subtle hints of incest are disturbing and unnecessary."
2,not too sure.,"i would only recommend this book to people who know nothing at all about tattooing. i would have rather named this book ""tattooing for dummies"". if you're new to the tattooing community this book will definitely provide you with useful information, otherwise it just wont do much for you. too many generalizations, i feel. the language used is very much aimed at an american audience."
3,Not TOTAL tattoo book,"Well it was a light read and i learnt a little. It doesn't deserve its title of TOTAL tattoo book because its far from complete. The author goes off the track with personal stories on many occasions and forgets what she is supposed to be talking about, so the subtitles in each chapter are loosely connected with the text.However, i wouldn't totally discourage the purchasing of this book as I was entertained by it. After all any tattoo talk is interesting, although in my opinion the author should have stuck to one genre- either a personal recount of the artists she knows and her experience- or a profesional factual novel in 3rd person.It was a light read that was enough to pass the time."
3,for beginners only?,this book is very very fundamental. the black and white photos are small and pretty useless and the color shots could be better.better books are available
3,Simple Wedge,"It's a decently made wedge, what else do you want. I recommend it to any beginner such as myself. I purchased this wedge because I have no idea if I could even hit a wedge and wanted to beat this one up while I learned, instead of destroying my wife's Tight Lies SW."
2,not his best,"Bentley Little is a master at taking ordinary American situations or things and making them terrifying. In a Little book going to the store or buying insurance is a direct trip to nightmare land. Dispatch doesn't measure up to his other stuff. The ""hero"" is a jerk and deserves to have his smug, superior little existence shook up. The plot takes one turn that was so ridiculous that it made me roll my eyes and when the Big Bad-- the monster is finally revealed it's not impressive at all. If this is the first Little book you've looked at try one of his others instead. I'll still read Bentley Little but I was not satisfied with this one at all."
3,Great Writing and Plot Idea but Big Let down at the End,"Ya, Know, It's an ok book. But the ending really let me down. The First 2/3rds were great. Im probably going to read one of his more popular pieces to see if that does it for me. After reading this book, you will get the sense that the publisher walked in - read the unfinished manuscript - stopped at page 235 and then told Bentley - ""Dude. Put a monster in it."" So Bentley forced a monster into a perfectly good emotional first-person thriller. I expected it to end in a realistically tragic way - instead I felt like writing a complaint letter to the author. Absolutely Fabulous plot premises but the end missed the boat. Also felt like it was two books forced into one. Can't really Recommend this one strongly. The Skill of the Writer is what prevents me from giving it only 2 stars."
2,Pap Puff Smoke Hype,"Blame this period mostly on Martin Turner who wanted the direction to be more 'hip' with the times. Probably of the 3 reunion records, this one is the 'most tolerable' but its hardly on target! The fire and intensity is, for the most part, left out of the production. Instead we get 'chimey' new wave interludes through 'Cosmic Jazz"" and yet we get a KAROKE version, too, egad! The only two songs that cut it to the bone are 'Walk on Water' and 'Keeper of the Light', which rekindles some of that magic and spirit from the early days. Outside of that, well this is quite a horizontal excursion-here to where?"
5,GREAT BOOK MINT CONDITION,This book came in mint conditon. The seller sent the book out immediately and I received it in 2 days from the date of mailing. This seller really delivers. Thank you.
1,Repulsive...deserves zero stars,"Anastasio Somoza was many things, among them a rapist, torturer, murderer, and child-killer. He was a man who slaughtered teachers, health-care workers, farmers, college students, school-children and trade unionists, some who were thrown into his private zoo to be eaten alive by wild animals. All this occurred with the enthusiastic support of US presidents (including Jimmy Carter) who backed Somoza to the very end, contrary to the lies of another reviewer here. If you want a glimpse into the twisted mind of a mass murderer who attempts to lie his way into history, pick this one up."
5,Pirate telescope,"This is a wonderful telescope for little pirates! The telescope works great, and you can focus. It's great for viewing objects far away (since it does actually work). The removable red light scope is a fun attachment for little explorers. The only thing that would improve this item is to have a belt clip."
4,"The Informed Argument, Brief Edition","The Informed Argument, Brief Edition is written in such a way that it is not a quick read, at least for me. But very informative nontheless :]"
5,Very nicely done,"I thought this CD was very nicely done. It's been done using ""local"" Hawaiian musicians/artists so I wouldn't have thought it to have ""soul?"". You don't have to live in Hawaii to enjoy this!"
5,Brilliant!,Blavatsky presents brilliant writing and literary genius in her presentation of evidence and arguments of what mere science overlooks when it endeavors to prove only that which can be explained using the scientific method. So much can be learned and actualized once we understand life and the world beyond the trappings of science.
2,Confronting Jezebel,"Good subject, good observations. Random thoughts don't follow a cohesive trail. Never develops theme to conclusion, but does have notable excellant views.The author needs an editor. Publisher did him (and themselves) no favors!"
5,Unveiling the meaning of life,"This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the future of science, medicine, and technology. Though I have been intrigued with the human genome project and the mapping of other life forms, I had never understood the process or knew the key players in the epic search to do so. James Shreeves' masterful account of this landmark achievement brings the complex and compelling venture into sharp focus. His narrative includes not only colorful and insightful quotes from those involved on all levels, but also offers cogent explanations of the technical and scientific issues in breakthrough biological data-processing that will eventually change all our lives."
5,This guy is BADD.,"Brian Simpson is one badd Mutha (shut yo mouth!) dude. The melodic piano over cool R&B bass will keep this dude in the smooth jazz game for a very long time. Janet Jackson should be proud of the way he covered ""Because of Love""."
1,Don't even think about buying this CD!,"After recently seeing The Fixx in concert and wanting to add to my collection of their CDs, I bought this disc. From the first chord it struck me as an ""MTV Unplugged"" version of their songs, covered by an unknown, low-quality garage band. In most of the songs, it is literally hard to identify the songs as being performed by the Fixx. I still have some doubts. Even if you are a hard-core Fixx devotee, this CD is of such poor quality that it is not worth purchasing, in my view."
2,Notionistic,"The book contains a lot of undigested info on trading in currency markets, failing to explain much of the things it illustrates."
1,a big fat ZERO. prik daddy strikes again.,"This is gotta be the worse album ever to be released. If u a real hiphop fan, dont waist your buck on this album. Buy britney spears album if u have to. Serious, this is sooo wack. None of the tracks represent Biggies material. New beats, with old skool lyrics just didnt do it. Maybe if we had Dre, scott storch etc producing it - wuldve been a different outcome. How can you have artists like Nelly, Santana on biggies album. I mean please....."
1,Another lousy money maker for P Diddy,wow i am dissapointed.the truth is all p diddy has his mind on is moneyafter buying this album and listening to its awful beats and artists( besides bob marley and Biggie) i found that p diddy produced all the beats and choose all the artistsHeres the deal you put biggie on the cover of an album and it will sell. Good thinking p diddy the album suckswaste of 15 bucks for meTHE ONE GOOD SONG IS HOLD YA HEAD UP with bob marley and thats iteverything else is songs with nelly and those pop artists that people who know nothing about hip hop listen to
1,He Suck'd the first time around,"B.I.G is a gay fat loser.Retarts keep sayin lighten up,but come on,2pacs matareal is better but fake cause they got him saying kiss,trice(obie trices name).Anyway this is just a remake of his old music,with different beats,wack rappers(all of them except Korn,pac).Besides the only album that was worth it in his carrer is Ready to die.2pac sold way more records than his best combined.Im rydin witt Makaveli The Don 4 lyfe"
1,Super wack......this is the final one. PLEASE!,"I never thought I would have to spit venom on BIG but this album is super wack. When will everybody stop trying to make money off of a dead man and let him rest in peace. If BIG were alive he would never have done songs with some of these wack rappers i.e Nelly amongst others. Then again when I think about it BIG didn't do anything but spit about fantasy gansta stories, Kristal, and women, so maybe he would've done some of the songs that are on this album. Put it it simple and plain this album gave me the craps when I listened to it."
1,I guarentee B.I.G. is rolling in his grave,"Pure garbage. Every song on this album sucks. Rap is dead and Puffy killed it. I love how a lot of other reviewers think many of the tracks are like 6 or 7 stars out of five. Come on, the only artists on this album who deserve any respect are Big and Pac, everybody else sucks. How you gonna put BIG on an album with artists like Nelly, Korny, Fat Thug and T.I.? Somebody needs to let CheesePuff know the deal and tell him to stop destroying BIGs rep. Biggie's rhymes are still sick, but only in the context of his original beats. These new cuts and remixes don't fit with the lyrics at all and they make Biggie sound terrible, which he wasn't. If CheesePuff wanted to do a remix album with Biggie's music, he should have done it right and kept himself and wack artists away from the mic. Buffy, stop making money off your boy and let him rest in peace with all the respect and honor he deserves."
1,Garbage,"This is total disrespect to the best MC of all time. They took his amazing style and talent and mixed him with subpar rappers, with sub par beats.Absolute garbage."
3,Not Like Lawrence Welk,"I was shopping for muzack, easy listening, elevator music---whatever you call it. I was searching for a particular sound from the 60s-70s. This set came up in my search and ordered it, thinking it would be similar to Lawrence Welk or Percy Faith. It is not. It is much more Big Band (horns) than I imagined it would be, and it has singers. I didn't want words, just popular music arranged for orchestra. The one saving grace is ""Up, Up and Away"" (in my beautiful, my beautiful balloooooooooooon). But it's sad I bought 3 CDs for one song. I'm going to end up giving them to my mom."
3,"Not the best, but worth having","If you're a budding Goblin fan, this is not the album for you. I would recommend Vol. 1 higher because it has a sampling of just about every soundtrack they worked on. This centers on the ""Profondo Rosso"", ""Suspiria"", and ""Contamination"" soundtracks. While a lot of the ""Profondo Rosso"" tracks are great, especially ""Death Dies"", ""Profondo Rosso"", and the remix of the title song, ""Suspiria"" is not represented very well. The main title theme for ""Suspiria"" is on Vol. 1 and the tracks here are not very good. ""Contamination"" takes an acquired taste to appreciate, but ""Connexion"" is complex in its simplicity. Overall, this is for die-hard Goblin fans only, not for beginners delving into the world of Goblin."
1,Nobel Prize for What?,"I selected this book for my book club based on reviews and the fact that the author won the Nobel Prize for 2012. Sadly, I was quite disappointed. Perhaps something is lost in translation, but even though I always appreciate historically based fiction the story is at times tedious for over-description and then confusing due to lack of detail. Not what I was expecting at all."
2,Wouldn't hurt to be Chinese,"A very difficult read. A lot of repetition (almost as if it were unabridged) and character were very hard to relate to. As a matter of fact, half the time, I wasn't sure who the author was talking about. Would be easier if one were used to the oriental naming system."
2,Not for gift giving across the miles and non-health nuts,"While the majority of the recipes are delicous, the serious draw back of this book is that the majority of the concoctions require refridgeration and need to be discarded after a week. This book is a great idea for those who may want to whip up a quick hostess gift when visiting a neighbor for dinner but not so great for those who want to blitz their gift lists and make items in bulk for holiday gift giving."
3,This is not a book,"I was under the impression when I bought this that it was a full book, but keep in mind this is just an essay. Printing quality is very low, type is big and it's more like a coursebook than a real published book for your library. I would have been better off buying a nicer anthology with this as a section instead of this flimsy photocopy job."
4,all you need to know about fiscal sponsorship,"The book is written for the general reader, but it can still be hard to work your way through the various scenarios. Nonetheless, it's a useful tool it you are thinking of using fiscal sponsorship."
3,Jonas Kaufman is superb,"Jonas Kaufman is superb, both in terms of singing and acting. Anna Antonacci looks good and acts well as Carmen, but her singing lacks power. This especially makes the final scene not very satisfactory, despite the fine performance of Jonas. The tension and emotion are missing.I am not an expert on the different versions of the opera, but noticed that the ""market chorus"" scene is missing in the final act. The first act duet between Micaela and Don Jose is also shortened.I have the Agnes Baltsa/Jose Carreras Metropolitan Opera version, in my opinion much better overall than this one. There is so much more intensity and emotions in the final scene that I find myself sitting on the edge of the sofa sometimes."
3,Not Bad,"This was a pleasant book. I was looking for writing style similar to Lynn Austin or Kim Vogel Sawyer, but this was different. It was still nice to learn about the era."
4,"Good Hi-life, West African Music",Music that sounds like a cross between soca and juju. Recommended for fans of West African music.
2,First Album was better..,"Beastie or no Beastie Boys, I was dissapointed when played Vallejo's new album. As compared to their fantastic debut, this album just fails to rock. I can appreciate the approach back to latin roots, but I though this band rocked harder. Totally uninspired. It sounds like DJ Hurricane took the storm out of a firery latino rock band. I still wish to see if they still rock live. I also can't understand why AJ and Alex are posed on the cover the way they are.."
4,"Good product, but order some extra zip ties!","So far these are really good fender. The mud flaps are a nice touch. They go on your bike relatively easy and look good. However, some parts are kept in place with zip ties (so as to keep the fenders from wiggling around while riding), but they only send you the bare minimum number of zip ties. So if any of the zip ties break (which is very easy to do), you will have lose fenders/the fenders might not stay on.I would recommend these fenders if you live in a rainy, wet area. Just get some spare zip ties!Other than broken zip ties, I have no complaints about these fenders. I have not had much of a chance to use them (surprisingly nice weather as of late!). However, if I do come across some other issues, I'll be sure to update."
2,Nothing special.,"I bought these for my Avery eGrip pens, which I love, but appear to have been discontinued. The refills are a bit too long, so I cut them down and they fit perfectly. They ran out of ink quickly, tho, and the ink does not flow smoothly over the paper. Just a so-so product that I will not buy again."
5,Michael's passion is back on track!,"His return to passionate saxy music is welcomed. His smooth, flowing rhythm stirs the soul and makes one long for a fire and a bottle of wine with your favorite girl. He's back on top!"
4,Wallowitch's Guide to New York,"No one would accuse John Wallowitch of having had a great voice, but his heartfelt, witty, and sometimes poignant lyrics provide a look into a New York clearly dear to him. He could best be described as Cole Porter meets Armistead Maupin. No subject is too mundane or too profound to escape his songwriting."
3,Too Much Simon,"This book would have been great, but the author injects his own self-congratulatory narrative through the whole thing. Instead of biographical pieces of the women and their own thoughts, this is a collection of SIMON'S thoughts about the women, and his voice overshadows everything else. A little of the author's analysis would have been great, but he won't let this women be the stars of the show, it's Simon, Simon, Simon all over every page."
2,Not essential P-Funk!!,"I only recommend this to hardcore p-funk fans. This has got to be the weakest of all their records. It's a matter of taste though, and if you like synthesizers and that obscure 80's funk sound, minus the drum machines, then you might like this. Bootsy is all over this one too, which is I why I was surprised by its weakness. He must have been more focused on his solo work at the time. The only reason I gave this any stars is because it is Parliament. Out of all the p-funk records, only two are below par, and this is one of them."
2,Disappointed...,"After all the rave reviews this book has gotten I was surprised to be disappointed. My 21 month old daughter who LOVES books found this book to be utterly boring. (We began potty training about a month ago.) I tried reading it to her on several occasions but she lost interest after a couple of pages every time. Maybe it would be better for an older child. It seemed to have too many words and was very long.I liked that they showed a baby breast feeding and a father being involved with everything. However, the illustrations were uninspired. The text is very straight forward which is either a plus or a minus (clear or boring?) depending on your point of view. It is definately instructional.I will just have to keep looking for a potty training book I like. Or not. My daughter seems to be doing just fine without one."
4,My first ballet experience was a good one,The is the first ballet I have even seen and it was a pleasure. What I like most was the music. It is very powerful and the sound quality is also very good. The camera work is very clear although I thought the cameras were too far away on some of the scenes. This DVD is a keeper and I highly recommend it.

3,awesome ten month camera,"This camera is everything that it promises for ten months out of the year. We have had ours for two years and last year it was in the shop for the entire two months allotted under warranty- then they sent us a new one. . . here we are four months later and the lens locked up- they say it is being shipped now so we will only have been without it for five weeks now. . . My sister bought this camera a few months after I did on my recommendation- hers just refused to turn on, as ours did last year, and she is sending it in. . . We will not buy another Kodak product because of their abysmal service responses."
1,Misleading.,I love the Vera books and have a collection of them. The video is just someone reading the story with the pictures from the book. I was disappointed.
4,Love the coverage hate the drip,"I have used henna for many years. As I have begun to gray I started using this product - it truly is easier to use (I have long hair) and does cover the gray. However it bleeds after shampooing - for several weeks. If I could find a way to ""set"" the color I would be even happier, otherwise it's a great product."
5,All time favorite book for the usage of a pendulum,"If you want to learn a straight-forward no bullcrap way to learn to use the pendulum, Dale Olsen's books are the greatest. I love everything he's ever written. This book breaks down the art of linking to the subconscious via pendulum into an almost scientific artform. His approach to the subject reminds me of the GhostHunter's (Sci-Fi channel) approach to ghost hunting...Straight, analytical, open minded approach to a serious subject...No mumbo jumbo, type nonsense here. I have read books on the pendulum that are too far from home and fail to recognize the pendulum for the true technical artform and connection to the subconscious that it should be.So if you want a great breakdown and explanation of the subject of intuition and the usage of the pendulum this book is the best place to start."
2,Nope,"This item is not as pictured (does not have ""ultra-suede"" cover). Not very comfortable with typical vinyl seat cover. Save your money..."
1,ONe Hit WOnder,a One Trick Pony.her voice is cool.she sounded good with Heavy so what's Up? just being able to sing gets you no Love.she shouldn't have to Sell Herself.at this rate VH1 awaits her among countless others.
2,too much sex.,"This cd is all about sex, especially visible in ""Touch It"". The talent is there, but the songs are not."
5,HELLO? Is this one in stock or not?! Please chose 'a' or 'b.',"First of all, I have to say that the Pirates are one of the tightest, most powerful rock bands out there. Having said this, I WISH I could order and add this title to my collection. I have tried to order this particular CD three times now, only to have it say quantity of zero in my basket each time. Of course, I also cannot contact the seller to confirm whether or not it is in stock or not, but it continues to show stock. If it is not available, please DELETE your listing! Stuff like this is aggravating and time-consuming, and people don't have time to waste."
5,The Glorious Barbara Cook,I recently had the pleasure of meeting Barbara Cook. She told me this was her favorite recording of her career; I agree. It is an extraordinary concert. Barbara Cook's glorious performance is perfection.
4,Good Beginning For Children,Good examples of how to play the cards in order to take the tricks at the end of the play of each hand. Just reading it should help to develop the children's thinking skills. And maybe they will someday learn to be great bridge players.
5,Outstanding Zippo Lighter,"Isn't that beautiful? Of course, I don't smoke. It was a gift to my Dad. He really loves that thing. He loves smoking. It's a hobbit.The price is very reasonable here. You know, in other countries like China, such a Zippo Lighter can be several times more expensive, like $100 or something. Anyway, it's cheap here.The design is also nice. New York city is like a great machine, like a wound tight watch, always ticking. This Lighter represents the spirits of NYC, which makes it the best gift to my Dad. He lives in Shanghai."
4,Very good shampoo,If you used this shampoo i recommend you to also used coconut oil.It don't dry your hair out like some people may say.
4,"Good service, not an exact fix",This adapter came quick enough. I installed it on my 2000 Ford Excursion which it was to fix but I had a problem with the bottom edge of the device. It prevented me from being able to reinstall the bolts for the ftont tie downs. (Hooks on most trucks) Where the bottom curved under was the problem. If I did it again I would cut off a little less than an inch of the bottom where the bolts go up from the bottom. It fixs in very tight and appears as though it will not go into place until I bolted it down hard. I'm satified except I still have not been able to get the bolts back in for the front hooks. (tie downs)
5,badd blood 2004,this was an awsome ppv from the better brand anyway here are the matches.chris benoit and edge vs. la resistaincegood tag match id give it ****chris jericho vs. tyson tomkokinda boring but when you have jericho in a match he can make it watchable ***shelton benjaimen vs. randy orton for the ic titleawsome match almost perfect my 2nd favorete match of the night *****fatel four way for the womens titletrish stratus vs. gail kim vs. lita vs. victoriapretty good womens match **eugene vs. coachstupid match why is coach on this ppv? *** just cause eugenes in it.chris benoit vs. kane for the world titlebenoits second match of the night i didnt really like this match but it had some good parts. ***hell in a celltriple h vs. shawn michaelsamazing match brutal big bumbs from both men exspecially michaels but when triple h went through a table i loved it perfect match. *****
3,good but not the best,the hell in a cell was my favorite an end to the greatest rivalry yeah right beniot v.s.kane was good but somewhat boring eugene can just go back home no one likes um the other matches were cool i seen it on ppv and i always buy all new wwe dvds
3,Pretty average PPV and below average Hell in a Cell..,Not the PPV I was expecting but enjoyable nonthe less. The only match that really caught my eye was the Eugene match but the rest were just plain boring...I was expecting this to be the greatest Hell in a Cell ever....Just average..If you want a good PPV with a semi-good HIAC match get the Judgment Day 02' PPV.Overall this is average...3 out of 5Lates
4,Very helpful guide,This book has great recipes and a great index for pretty much any ailment you may want a juice for. Very helpful guide.
2,only 50 limited recipes,The book has only 50 recipes and most of them call for ginger or celery or parsley that I hate. I could find only 3-4 recipes that sounded good to me. I saw the book in a store and liked that it had nutrition information for juices. Not every book has that. But the recipes themselves suck if you do not like ginger or celery.
5,VINCY BOY DOES GOOD,Kevin deserves all his success from his days as a member of Suede you just knew that his smooth Voice would mash up the world! Big it up dread! The album is definitely worth its salt. Every song is worth a listen with Turn Me on Worthy of every prop....A definite must have!
5,A Great BIG Job for Mr. Lyttle!!!!!,"I love this album. I didn't really listen to Soca music, but since the hit ""Turn Me On"" I'm now hooked. He has a sensational voice that just very commendable for the type of music he's singing. Good Job Kevin Lyttle on your first album."
3,Good Try...,"3.5 stars actually...Kevin showed us a mixture of Soca and R&B;,it's cool! I love the hot single ""Turn Me On"",and the whole album is suitable to listen in summer dayz...But obviously, Kevin's work is lack of changes, all songs seem too same...Whatever,it's a good try..."
1,Wow.,"Kevin Lyttle's seems to have a unique talent of extending his 15 minutes of fame based on the beating to death of the extremely annoying 'Turn me on'. Well , at least he's talented at something, right ?"
1,Where is it?????????????,I have no idea how the book is because after a month I still haven't recieved it.
5,Vesuvius for the layman,"if you are interested in the geology of what happened in 79AD, this book is for you. With pictures of modern volcanic eruptions, the authors take you step by step through the cataclym that buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. Reading more artsy oriented books about Pompeii, i wondered: How come there are paster casts of the dead victims from pompeii and just skeletons from herculaneum? How come Pompeii is bured in ash/pumice and Herculaneum is buried in hard rock? how come the sea receeded during the eruption? How much of Harris's Novel Pompeii is taken from life/scientific evidence. This not so long book answered a lot of these questions for me. Even the black and white photos were impressive: ie how did the person that took this photo managed to survive this?"
4,Go see her live!!,"I bought this album after a fantastic live show. The theme of the show was 'you can have me if you're a millionaire'. Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near a millionaire, but I was completely in love with this woman over twice my age. She still has the ways of a catwoman. After the show, which was so seductive and thrilling, the album was a bit disappointing. It's not a bad album at all, but it doesn't have as much spirit or byte as her live appearance. But I must say 'Let's Misbehave' is beautiful, especially the beginning with only the bass and miss Kitt's voice. And it's that voice which makes even the classic 'The Nearness Of You' much more than just an evergreen. I would recommend to go see her live, if you have the chance. And then buy the album anyway, just to remind you how great she is."
2,Better versions out there...,"This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better. In this version, the illustration and text don't even match. The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes. I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward. The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text. The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't."
1,"shallow music, cannot relax when the music is so trite","I cannot relax to music that is shallow and trite. Rather than evoking space and creativity, this rather silly CD evokes a sense of confinement of the human spirit. Try Keith Jarett for the real thing !"
2,Unraveled,I bought these for Christmas and wore them a handful of times before they unraveled near the top and a large hole formed.
3,keeps u warm,i bought these to goto D.C. and they really kept my feet warm but theyre not too good if you're going to be walking long distances
5,The Best Album so far this year,I really think this has to be the best album of the year so far. The lyrics are great in this as well as the music. Every song is extremely strong rather than just have 2 or 3 good songs.
2,"Poor quality control, not much clearance","The package is supposed to contain 15 mounting kits. Mine showed up with 15 screws, 13 metal spacers, and 17 plastic sleeves. So they get the total number of parts right, but only 13 usable sets. Of all the things to skimp on too, the spacers are the ones I cannot pick up at my local hardware store.I also noticed the bag had the wrong label on it, describing how to attach the enclosed hooks on a pegboard.I was able to make do as I really only needed 12 spacers and installing them is fairly self-explanatory.Once installed, I noticed that some of my pegs would scrape the wall behind. There is probably only 1 mm of interference, but enough to leave a nice gouge here and there.If they included the pieces they said they would and had made the spacers another mm deeper, I would have been pretty satisfied."
5,A Teacup in a Storm,"The best thing about this book is that it reveals many interesting ""I didn't know that..."" bits of information on how the 19th and 20th century explorers dealt with the challenges of exploration. Overall, this book is both informative and entertaining and broken up into many different sections- which helps speed the reading along."
5,Audra McDonald is a woman of amazing talent,"Audra has an amazing approach to her singing. Everything she sings seems so conversational and effortless. Careful attention is applied to every part of every song. Overall it is an incredibly enjoyable, innovative, and charming way to make a debut on a solo album"
5,Audra is releases a compelling compilation,"Audra McDonald, 3 time Tony winner at only 28, has taken the correct approach to her first solo effort. Instead of going with the standards, she breaks the norm and goes for up and coming writers. This recording goes from devistatingly heartbreaking story-songs (Come to Jesus) to uplifting ditties (Baby Moon). Her voice soars over every note...."
2,A brave but disappointing debut CD.,"Having loved Audra McDonald in ""Carousel,"" ""Master Class"" and ""Ragtime,"" I eagerly awaited her debut CD and couldn't wait to get it in my CD player. But this is a collection of songs that is quite difficult to wrap your ears around. The lyrical content is good, but the melodies try very hard to out-do Sondheim in terms of atonal histrionics. The result is a screeching mess. While McDonald should be applauded for taking artistic chances, I had hoped this CD would showcase her superior voice in a better way."
5,Wonderful.Simply Wonderful/,"When I first listened to the record, I immediately like ""Stars and Moon"" and ""Baby Moon"". I couldn't get in to other songs too much. But after listening, I now love ""Tom"" and ""You Don't Know This Man"" and like ""Way Back to Paradise"". Email me, please if you have any info on this wonderful singer!!"
1,Now out-of-date,"This version has been eclipsed by Acid Music 2.0. The differences between the versions are significant, and it's well worth the extra money to get the latest version."
3,Not sure why it's supposed to be better than other brands,"When I read that Three Crabs was a premier brand, of course I wanted to try it. It can be difficult to find, so I checked with Amazon, but didn't want to pay such a high shipping fee. Luckily, I happened to notice it on the shelf of my local Korean market. Initially felt it was too salty, but have been using it for a while and it's fine. That doesn't mean that the non-premium brands I've bought were bad - they were just fine, as well."
3,Intelligent singer but small voice.,"Sherri is an intelligent, tasteful singer and the song selection and band are quite good. For me she doesn't have enough charisma or creativity to overcome her fragile vibrato and limited dynamic and expressive range."
3,Early 1970's compilation of 1960's Stones tracks.,"""Rock N'Rolling Stones"" was an early 1970's British Decca compilation of 1960's Rolling Stones recordings, including several tracks which were hard to get at the time. This Russian reissue of the album has some interesting live concert bonus tracks, but the attempt to re-create the album itself does not use all of the correct versions & mixes. The notable inclusion on the original vinyl L.P. was the only-ever stereo release of ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love""(the 2nd version-RCA Studios/Hollywood), but on this CD, you get the mono demo version from Regent Sound Studios in London. Also, the packaging for the CD lists ""Bye Bye Johnny"", but the CD plays the song ""We Love You"" Instead"
3,"Beautiful voice, average songs.","I think Ms. Elliman has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard so I don't understand why the quality of the songs having made for her is so poor. With the exception of If I can't have you, or the ones in Jesuscrist Superstar, there's nothing remarkable. Too bad! Her voice and performance are amazing when singing a good tune."
1,Terrible book on FX trading!,The last 5-6 reviews were written by the same person with multiple ID's to boost the overall rating! The language is nearly the same. This book was written by someone with a basic understanding of FOREX; probably thumbed through a few books. The writing is terrible to follow and does not cover any material to allow you to grow as a trader. I doubt this guy ever made money trading FOREX!
1,Very very bad indeed,I have read many many book on Forex trading and this is one of the worst written ones I have come across in 8 years or so. As other reviewers have pointed out you'll notice all the good reviews on this book (all 5 star not surprisingly) seem to be written by the same person or persons. Don't waste any money on this what so ever!!!
5,Art Education Wouldn't Be Complete,"without studying Leonardo da Vinci, one of the greatest Italian Renaissance artist and would-be inventor of all time. He left us a legacy of paintings, drawings, diagrams, inventions, and even sculpture for all to see. He's known more than the Mona Lisa painting, he's an inventor of sorts as well as a very fine draughtsman.This book should be a required course for art students everywhere."
1,Kikkoman STICK TO SOY SAUCE!,"When I went to pick out a sweet and sour sauce instead of buying a brand I wasn't familiar with, I bought Kikkoman. They're known for their delicious soy sauce that has been praised by many. So I thought to myself, well the sweet and sour sauce ought to be good too!Like the other review here, it was DISGUSTING. It pretty much ruined the entire meal I made it with. I also agree that it is VERY expensive and my one dinner I made with it took the entire bottle, yikes! Not budget friendly and definately NOT friendly on the tongue.Would never buy again and will be looking into other brands next time I'm in need of some sweet and sour sauce!"
2,Emmas Mommy,This item is not what the picture sells. You would think with the picture that you are buying three and that is not the case
5,Excellent authentic Sony battery. Great Seller. Fast delivery too.,"I was concerned about the authencity of this new Sony battery. Well, I'm glad I was wrong. The battery looks authentic and acts authentic. Clean details and edges of the battery match perfectly. Holds the charge well too. I am very happy with it! Great seller sent me the new battery as promised. Thank you!!!!"
3,This is my fourth annual replacement,"I use my Sony VAIO laptop mainly at my desk, plugged in to a docking station. I run it on the battery when I travel, which is infrequently. I have to replace the battery about once a year. Maybe this is standard, maybe I should take the battery out when I'm using electrical power, but it's expensive and it's a pain."
5,fast service/best price/works great,better price than buying direct from Sony. Easy input ..worked right awayvery pleased
1,Junk,"This battery is a piece of junk. Do not buy it. It says SONY on it but it is covered up by a Made in China sticker. It lasted about an hour the first few times and now, about 3 weeks later, it won't last more than a few minutes. It is the sorriest purchase I have ever made on AMAZON."
3,Max battery for SZ only 2.5 hours.,"Well my Sony Vaio SZ display model lost its battery. I got a Circuit City's generic brand that didn't work and returned it. I read the Vaio's SZ review that said the battery will last 4-6 hours? This one on first, second and later charges lasted like 2 to 2.5 hours max. It runs 2 hours with speed turn on and reduced brightness. 2.5 hour with max battery on Vista and stamina turn on. My old 2001 Dell laptop's battery lasted 2.5 hours on the first day. I am not sure what the reviews are for 4-6 hours, should I return this. It does work fine though and was in brand new box with sticker."
3,Fun read,My first experience with a Cathy Kelly novel and I enjoyed it. A nice story with two women who both want the same job and both are endearing and solid characters which you end up hoping for success. Nice read - go for it.
4,Off the Planet,This was an easy read of a scientific experiment. It was scarey to find out what really happened when one of our own went to spend time on the Russian space station. The book reads like fiction.
5,a great book about living in space,this book shows the truth about living in space. the author describes all the hardships that he and the crew went through
2,Jerry's ego is off the planet,"No Doubt that Jerry Linenger is a very brave very intelligent guy. But this book is 253 pages of self praise and I could barely get through it, particularly the first few chapters. ""I am formally Dr.,Dr.,Dr.,Dr.,Dr. Jerry Linenger"" ""My name properly written is Jerry Michael Linenger, M.D, M.S.S.M.,M.P.H.,Ph.D."" The words 'me,my, I' predominate. Other people in the book are glossed over and no one is as smart and clued in as Jerry. The sequence of events is also organized in a disjointed way, it leaps from the present to the future to the past all within one chapter, and there are 27 chapters. It reads like a collection of articles. And he states and restates the same facts over and over. The book does cover some interesting ground, but overall it was disapointing."
2,Boring,"Jerry Linenger belongs in space -- the earth is not big enough to fit his ego. The book is pretty boring and repetitive. How many times do we have to be reminded that the shuttle orbits at 17,500 mph ! Most of the good stuff, Mir breakdowns, ground control politics, etc, takes only a few pages to describe. A lot of the rest is constant reminders of how highly Linenger thinks of himself interspersed with tired space cliches. Don't waste your money."
4,Interesting Stuff - But A Little Thin,There has not been much written about NASA post-Apollo. This book tell's the author's story of going to Mir. It is an amazing story of surviving a fire in space and near collision with another ship on the station. My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more depth and detail and the author's experiences.
4,"Large battery holds own, so far","I've had this large capacity battery now for about a month and I am getting around 4.5-5.0 hours of charge on it regularly. So no problems and it is working as expected. My worry is that I also previously had a large capacity battery that I ordered with my Viao about 2 years ago. That battery routinely held a 3.0-3.5 hour charge, with no problems though daily use until one day it just up and died with no warning. So, yes I am glad that I have a new working battery with a long charge, but I am weary that it will just up and die at some point. Oh well, what can you do."
3,Useful Bibliography,"This book, like most 'idiot's guide' texts does a good job of looking at third layer concepts of leadership. Using a variety of outside sources this book takes you though a general overview on the topics of leadership. The best part about this book is the bibliography which will point you to many great books on management and leadership. This is a good text for those who just have not spent a lot of time thinking about, studying, or maybe even caring about leadership. Check out the bibliography for more in-depth books on this topic. Joseph Dworak"
5,My kids love it,"As a fan of David Macaulay for many years - and of his earlier more ""technical"" books ""How things work"" - I had give this one a try. I also got ""Why the Chicken Crossed the Road"". They liked both. But of the two, the kids liked this one better - me too."
2,Get what you pay for,"Great price, but the chargers don't function as well as the OEM one. When the phone gets fully charged it starts to beep saying that it is charger and continues to do this until it is removed from the charger. With the factory charger it would just show that it was fully charged on the screen and no annoying noise. Mainly a problem when we put the phone on the charger before bed and wake up at 2AM to the phone's soft, persistent beeping."
2,Okay product,"The product is just okay. If you live in NY, the roads are very bumpy. Everytime I hit a bump the clip falls right off the window which gets annoying so you end up leaving it in the seat. I like the color option since it matches with my car. This product is okay...no frills and I guess it's better than that big piece of tape on the windshield."
1,"Good design, but substandard plastic","I use these in three of my cars. Two holders have functioned well, but the third suffered distortion and partial melting in a new Prius over the course of one winter and spring parked outdoors. Definitely not a mere molding error...some of the melted plastic had actually flowed around and onto the suction cups.Once it softens, the holder is junk. The tension from gripping an EzPass pulls against the suction cup mounts until they deform and point in three new directions, opposite the curve of a windshield, and they'll never stay put again. I'll keep using the other two while they work (they'll probably survive in the shade of the garage) but will shop for another solution."
1,Avoid!,"I live in the Northeast and suction cups are worthless. They stopped working consistently after 6 months and are woefully ineffective in cold and hot weather. The product feels cheap and the plastic has melted around the suction cups. I guess if you drove in a climate controlled tunnel with no sunlight, then the EZ clip would be fine."
4,very pretty,There isn't much too this but it very sexy. The material is very thin but its held up well to washing and some fun!! It fit well.
5,Just what I expected,"I got exactly what I expected. Great value, and super sexy garment. No regrets with this purchase. I would buy this again, but don't because of the quality, don't think I will have to."
4,Very Happy,"Its hard for me to find outfits like this to fit my body the way it should..usually one are is off just a bit. This one, fit everything perfectly, and it drove my husband wild! The material is very soft and you know sometimes when you buy an outfit and it just doesnt seem like good material, like its cheap. This is not like that at all. Its very worth it!"
5,"Beautiful, sexy gown!","This gown is beautiful! It made me feel very sexy and my boyfriend loved it! As one other reviewer mentioned, it's not the highest quality of fabric but for the price, it is fine. The Amazon.com Marketplace seller was great and shipped the item very quickly!"
3,"Richly Detailed, Increasingly Boring","Wilson's book is undeniably well-written. What is deniable is how interesting and involving it is. The set-up is good and the first 150 pages moved along well as we are introduced to the cast of characters and their motivations. The following 100 pages read like quicksand however, and the pace begins to move slower and slower. By the time I got to page 270 I surrendered and refused to fight through the boredom that had captured me.If you like spy thrillers like Le Carre wrote grab this book.If you enjoy a Follett or Silva-paced thriller skip this."
5,No pre-programmed arguments,"Kates and Kleck present a reasoned discussion of the possession, control and use of guns and their impact on violence and crime in the US.The book is a refreshing change from the pre-programmed argumentation that characterizes most of the ""gun debate"". As a gun owner, I dislike the lack of intellectual honesty that is endemic in the anti-gun literature but I also recognize the repetitive, almost ritual pro-gun prose.Kates and Kleck address the traditional guns'n crime issues but also say that some types of gun control are desireable (ones aimed at disarming or disabling people who've demonstrated membership in the ""criminal class"").They address in some detail the intellectual dishonesty behind much of anti-gun ""science"" and the biases in much of the press coverage of the ""gun debate"".It's a very informative and readable book. I recommend it highly."
3,"good at the basics but unsatisfying, hard to read","This book was required for my Typography I class and at first I really enjoyed the stylish layout and color. But eventually I began to hate it because all the important info is flushed to the right side of the page, in red and, worst of all, italicized. I do have to mention that the book has very good visual examples, which is probably the best aspect of the book altogether. This book has tons of great info for beginners in type or graphic design, it just needs to have a less flashy layout."
3,"Not bad, but definitely not great","If you know nothing at all about type, this is a fine introduction. But it stops at the surface. It does cover the various attributes and functions of type, and it's a very quick read (every other page is a picture), so it's definitely not useless. But it's a scattered book that avoids depth at the expense of flashiness. If you're serious about learning about typography, this is probably not the text for you. If you're bored on a subway, or just curious about graphic design, it might be a fun read. Though it serves its purpose as a typography book for the masses, I was left unsatisfied with this ""timeless classic on typography."""
2,Simple...,"I'm not sure why, but was this the pocket book edition of the book ? i'm don't know if many people need it for quick reference, but it doesn't go beyong that."
5,Quest for clarity in the brave world of Media2.0,"This is quite an interesting and humoristic little book that should be made a must read for all bloggers, web designers and other web 2.0 communicators. Erik Spiekermann and E.M Ginger bring a very educated viewpoint to the never boring debate of form v.s. function and substance v.s. style. There is no doubt that they're choosing style and more specifically the role of Typographic style on effective communication. A debate started quite some time ago with Gutenberg!"
2,An Annoying Little Book,"As other reviewers have said, this book is WAY too basic.Once the authors say that you should pick the right typeface for the job, they run out of things to say. There's pictures of shoes from the 15th century to the present, photos of a woman pulling faces, pictures proving (proving!) that type styles have changed since the 15th century (boy, what a shock, eh?) and heaps of other irrelevancies.I find the book pleasant to look at but, as textbooks go, it's a real waste of money."
3,Piece of fluff!,"This book is an enjoyable piece of fluff. Pretty shallow, and the ending is anti-climatic, no real sparks here....ho hum!"
3,ArginMax for Sexual Fitness Does Help,"I do think this product makes a difference. I hate taking pills to begin with, and to take six (yes, six!) large pills per day is extremely difficult for me. However, it's been one of the few vitamins that do not make me nauseous on an empty stomach. I started out taking the recommended dosage and it definitely helped, but it's hard for me to stick with the six-pills-per-day regime."
4,"Excellent B-Sides, Not So Excellent Remix, Price","I wish more bands would be like Pearl Jam and release domestic versions of import singles.As a weezer fan, I feel that the two B-Sides (I Do, Starlight) are top. 'I Do' is a ballad featuring some organ, and 'Starlight' is a uptempo number that would have fit well towards the end of the green album.The Jimmy Pop remix of 'Hash Pipe' isn't my cup of tea. It sounds a tad too much like that Bloodhound Gang song about doing it like they do on The Discovery Channel.If you are a big weezer fan, treat yourself right and fork over the money for this import. Casual weezer fans may want to wait for a B-Sides collection."
2,hard and crusty,"i read the review on garnier.com. it said that it would hold, that it did. it lasted threw a soccer game in 74% humidity. but it also said that it wouldn't make it hard and crusty. that was a lie, its supposed to be applied to dry hair. it dries not looking wet. but it dries your hair out a lot. also its hard and crusty"
1,Not for the short spiky/ faux hawk look,"This putty claims to give you the faux hawk look. Applied it and followed the instructions to blow dry. Ended up like I just got out of bed. Not quite the look I was going for. Tried again without blow drying but to no avail. This doesn't give you the spiky/ piecey hair that I was going for. Although it smells nice, it does not have very good hold at all and you have to use an insane amount of the product. Returned it."
5,Enlightening and entertaining,"This book denies many of the popular myths and beliefs about the Civil War south, and is a fascinating and exciting story of life during the war. I recommend this to any serious student of ante-bellum history, as well as to any one studying women's history. It was well written, well edited and thoroughly entertaining."
3,"Product good, company not-so-good","I like the product Dermactin TS and the first tube was purchased from a different provider. This time the product arrived in a broken box without the seal inside. When I contacted the company to replace it, they ignored my email request. No response at all!!!"
5,Wow!,"""Stronger"" is the best song B. Spears ever recorded until now. Who knows it could remain a classic! The song lifts you up with the vocals & music. The main attraction on this Single, is ""Walk on by"" which should have been included on the Album. It's a great track. It's nice to have the instrumental version of ""Stronger"", good for Karaoke... & Britney looks great on the cover."
4,Great gift for a hunter.,"My son in law is an avid hunter I sent him the Deer Hunters Gift Basket for the holidays. He has raved about it. Several of his friends have also commented on it and wanted to know where it came from, so that they could give it to friends."
4,A complete sourcebook on the Mechitzah,"This book compellingly presents the case that Baruch Litvin brought all the way up to the Michigan Supreme Court against the congregation of his synagogue in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The synagogue members voted to remove the mechitzah (the physical separation between the men and womens' sections of the synagogue sanctuary). Under Jewish law, it is forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a mechitzah. Litvin thus contended that in removing the mechitzah, he would be deprived of the beneficial use of the synagogue (in addition, there were no other Orthodox synagogues in Mt. Clemens at that time). Litvin prevailed in court and this volume richly documents the court case and its aftermath as well as the historic, rabbinic and halachic background behind the mechitzah. One caveat--this is a reference book, with sometimes repetitive sources--not necessarily a book to sit down and read straight through."
4,"vintage, heartfelt singing","Surprisingly good. I thought this was better singing than the two tracks I heard from her ""heyday"" in the 50s. Better than a lot of albums from more famous jazz singers, like Ella."
4,great patriotic movie,"the stroyline of the screenplay is a little shallow, but the directing, acting, camera are all good, especially the stunt, the choregraphic design of the fight scenes are amazingly fantastic. the only problem i found in thai historical movie is the hairdo. almost every one of the male and female roles in this movie are with hairdos that only hairdressers could have done and with lot of gel used. but again, the alamo-like fighting scenes are so vicious and realistic just like what best korean movies could deliver."
3,Trouble with Lego Train,"We purchased this train as a birthday present for our daughter, and it was great fun for a while; a short while. We experienced technical difficulties after having the train for only 2 short months and the train stopped working. The good news is that the folks at LEGO were very responsive and promptly sent out replacement parts to resolve our issues. They reported having a lot of problems with this model. It took two calls to customer service and about three weeks to get everything through the mail (in 2 separate shipments). Our train is now working again. Thanks LEGO."
3,THREADING TIME,"THE BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING IN HOW THE AUTHOR NOTED THE MANY REFERENCES TO THE IMPORTANCE OF TEXTILES IN IDENTIFYING SOCIAL GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, I FELT THAT OTHER AREAS WERE EITHER GLOSSED OVER OR ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF THIS BOOK. THE UTILIZATION OF PIECEMEAL WORK IN IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS. EG,THE BEGININGS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ILGW ASSOCIATION, AND HOW SUCCEEDING WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS(EG CHINESE)HAVE USED THIS WORK IN ESTABLIHING THEIR LIVES IN NEW COUNTRIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFER, UNIONIZED WORKPLACES FOR INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYEES. THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FIRE WAS BRIEFLY TOUCHED UPON, AS WELL AS THE WEAVERS' REVOLT. THE AUTHOR HAS ALSO FAILED TO NOTE THE SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENT OF CLOTHING INDUSTRIES TO POORER NATIONS WHERE THEY ARE FREQUENTLY IN VIOLATION OF EXPLOITING NATIVE LABORERS, CHILD LABORERS, AND MAINTAINING INHUMANE WORKPLACE GUIDELINES."
4,Nightfall...,"Having only recently been introduced to David Lanz's music, but having been acquainted with a diverse collection of other New Age work, my expectations were very high.This album as a whole did not catch my breath as some other New Age albums, but three songs in particular not only caught my breath, but also blew me away - 'Leaves On The Seine', 'Nightfall', and 'Courage Of The Wind'. Personally, these songs are up there with some of the most beautiful melancholic melodies ever created.A great tribute to piano music."
4,static mat,fits standard laptop. not too thick. easily rolls up for storage and flattens fast for use. good for infrequent use.
4,Soothing music with very high quality production,"I picked this jewel up on vinyl from Goodwill for $1, and just gave it a spin. And another. And I'm on the third one now. Very unassuming cover. I never had heard of the label, nor the artists. I must say, I'm happy to have discovered this musical gem! It's 25 years old, but the production quality and audio are fantastic. They even have a note on the cover ""Audiophile-Quality KC 569 Premium Virgin Vinyl"" which is really cool since someone at Narada obviously felt this music was worthy of fine sound...Throw this on, relax, and let ""Mountain Song"" transport you to a peaceful corner of a shady alpine forest in the heart of a vibrant spring. There are songs which focus on guitar --Eternal Holly by William Ellwood, and songs that are piano masterpieces -- Echoes by Michael Jones, and some fine woodwind work by Eric Tingstad and Nancy Rumbel on Fisherman's Dream. Fine sounds indeed. Four solid stars!"
2,Idea is great - contents are trash,"This is a wonderful idea - a small chewable box with holes that your rabbit can grab with his teeth - the problem is what's inside. Rabbits should not eat these kinds of trashy treats - they do not need seeds, nuts or honey.I took the trash out and filled the box with his normal pellet feed, and let him shake and toss the box to get the pellets to fall out. Poor toy transformed into wonderful toy. You can save yourself the money and just punch holes in a small box and fill it with HEALTHY stuff."
5,This C.D. rocks like nothing else ever made!!!,"It's too bad that White Zombie broke up, their music started the whole metal/techno sound. The only good thing to come of it is, Rob Zombie going solo. ""Dragula"" is the greatest hard rock song I've heard in a long time. Forget Marylin Manson, Rob Zombie is the new Anti-Christ Superstar. Watching him perform live was like nothing I've witnessed before. The whole C.D. kicks ass. You must go out and purchase this, especially if you liked White Zombie."
4,Not quite as good as anticipated!,"It is A VERY GOOD ALBUM and starts off very well with three top class songs:- 'Superbeast', 'Dragula', and 'Living Dead Girl'-The best song on the album, but after that it starts fading and can't quite kick ass as much as white zombie did. Depite some good songs like 'Meet the creeper' and 'the ballad of ressurection joe and rosa whore'. Good but invest in white zombie stuff instead."
5,ROCKIN,"If you're looking for a loud, fast album, this is it. If you want something with artistic merit, look elsewhere. I love it because I love Zombie."
2,Ooookaaay......,"This guy's a freakin psycho. All his songs are about monsters and demons and dead things and stuff. You'd think he's a necrophile or something! The only songs I can listen to are Superbeast and Dragula. ALl the other ones are way too bizarre for my taste. IF you felt the same way, look into Powerman 5000. Those guys are MUCH better."
5,WHA HAHA,"this album f'n hits...if u dont own a copy of it follow instructions: push start, then shut down, hop in jalopy and drive to local record store to purchase it. 13 songs (13 tales of cadaverous cavorting inside the spookshow international) stand out songs are living dead girl, dragula and superbeast but you can play the entire album from start to finish no problem. if you like to bang your head then you will surely love this!"
3,"Great, Try the original","Rob Zombie did well for himself breaking off from White Zombie, doing his own thing. The sound didn't change too much from White Zombie. If you liked Hellbilly Deluxe try Astro Creep or La Sexorcisto, which are better. They have the same crunching riffs ar Hellbilly but are a little better. GREAT CD"
2,Not very good...Sinister Urge is wayyy better!!!,"Rob Zombie is a [great singer], but that is why he's become so popular. But this CD (in my opinion) shouldn't be so popular. There's only 4 songs I like, and 3 of them are beginning to fade. They are ""Superbeast"", in which Rob Zombie sings with his trademark demon voice. The Girl On A Motorcycle mix is better, and you can get it off the ""End of Days"" soundtrack or ""American Made Music To Strip By"", Zombie's remi album. The 2nd is ""Living Dead Girl"", which I beleive was Zombie's first single for this album. It's very eerie and reminds me of a horror movie. The 3rd is ""Dragula"", which is getting very old. The 4th and last is ""Meet the Creeper"", and it's without a doubt the best.I reccomend this to anyone who's a fan of White Zombie, Powerman 5000, Ozzy Osbourne, or Marilyn Manson."
4,Still reading,"So far this book is turning out to be good, i just wish i had more time to read it. I'm at the part where Bowman just discovered his magic talent. I just think its a little wierd, i mean, this is a children' book and it has info about human burnings, its a little bloody if u dont mind my saying. Other than that, its interesting. I can't wait to find out what happens."
5,Interesting Read,"This book examines the effects and influence the Cuban Revolution had throughout Latin America. The author argues that Castro's success along with the romantic following that Che Guevara acquired, became almost a blueprint for the countless insurgent movements across the region. Interestingly, none but the Cuban revolution ultimately endured because people needed to learn that the Cuban Revolution could only work in Cuba; it was not exportable as Castro, Che and many others had hoped."
1,just awful,"I have seen hundreds of movies in my life, and this has to be the worst. Because it is apparently trying to make some important point. Because it includes big names Bertolucci and DeNiro. I apologize for not being able to adequately express how bad this movie is. The acting is bad, the cackling incessant, the music irritating, the dialogue often ridiculous, many scenes just disgusting, and so much more... I must admit, I was captivated by it for 5 full hours, it was so bad I could not stop watching it. I just sat there, mouth agape, shaking my head in (alternately) bewilderment and contempt. Just awful. Wow."
5,A great epic,"This is Bertollucci's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA. Long, carefully crafted, greatly acted, no holds barred.De Niro and Sutherland in a monumental Italian epic that leads from the chaos of pre-world war to the end of national socialism. A cheers-to-communism film for the uncareful watchers, a sociocritic masterpiece to the objective critic. 1900 - as it runs uncensored on austrian television for example - is a rare example of a 5 hour masterpiece that should stand there right next to suche similar movies as Leone's Once Upon A time in America or The Godfather. A must-see"
3,the tennis partner,"This book arrived to me without a cover, and lacking any sort of invoice therein. Aside from that, the book appears to be in good shape, and I am very much looking forward to reading the story! Dr Verghese is a wonderful writer, a terrific read. I have read his 2 other books (My Own Country ; Cutting for Stone), and have thoroughly enjoyed the way he depicts his stories, and developes his characters."
1,FAKE FOR SURE,THIS IS CHINA TOWN KNOCK OFF!!! I have the real fendi spy bag..and that is Fake. good luck. The only way to get a real bag is to save up and purchase it from the store yourself.
2,Uniden Bearcat BC72XLT Scanner programability,"I did not do enough research before buying this scanner. You cannot connect it to a computer to program. Everything has to be manually programmed. It arrived blank. It is not user friendly and takes quite a bit of work to learn how to program. It is not for new users, The scanner works well after you get it programmed,"
3,This is a good scanner if you don't want to scan the Police,"I don't know much about scanners so I read all the reviews and download the manual, read it and found out that the police frequencies where pre-programmed for scan. So I figured I could scan police frequencies. Well they forgot to write the part that says that all police frequencies are coded and you can't hear a thing. So if you want to scan anything but the police this is your scanner.This scanner is great for airplanes"
2,overall disappointed,Instructions where confusing. The trouble shooting page is worthless. I ended with finding a link to all my local Department with Itunes.
3,Alright,"This is the worst thing to try and figure out. Programming stations in was like taking a never ending test that you keep failing. Not user friendly at all. I live right on the out skirts of town and it picks up city police, prison, hospital, jail, and the air port pretty good. it will randomly go silent for five ten minutes at a time without anything going off so im not sure if that is just a coincidence or if its a cheap radio. all in all pretty good buy after you get it figured out."
3,Band Frequency not high enough.,Uniden makes a great product. I have the BC92XLT and it works great. I bought this for my mother to keep up to date on weather situations in our area but it does not have high enough frequencies to pick up the police and emergency bands in our area. This one would be perfect for Nascar racing fans.
4,Pretty nice,"I am really new to the whole scanner thing and was just looking for a scanner to get introduced to this genre. I am so far thinking it's cool to be able to listen in. The unit itself is fairly easy to figure out, the manual being equally easy to figure out as far as locating information. Is it worth the price? I don't know; as I stated, I am new to this. For me though, I would probably say yes. It is small, easy to keep out of the way when not in use, and seems to come in clear enough for me. I wish I could be more helpful, being able to compare this to other scanners out there, but I cannot. Perhaps this sucks next to others, perhaps it's the best out there. Pricewise, it's competitive to others on the market."
1,sucks,This piec of crap only got kfc and univison channel i was pissed.I did return it and got my money back
5,Very Nice Scanner,"I've owned Uniden scanners for decades and this one might be the best so far.Sure, it takes more steps do do things, but it's not a big deal.Compact size, rechargeable NiMHs last a long time, but take just as long to recharge.If you know how to use a scanner (it's obvious from some of the negative reviews that they don't) then this is a good one to get."
2,not user friendly,So far have been unable to scan channels that are selected. Owners manual poorly organized. No way to show one how to mix air channels and police channels to the same band.
3,Only good for Analog,The price on this scanner can't be beat. With all the Fire/Police/EMT going Digital after 9/11 You can only get a few channels. If your a NASCAR fan this is a great little scanner. I'd recommend it for that. Everybody else be prepared to pay some serious cash. Average price $375-$500. I returned it no problem. Live and learn.
3,BC7XLT SCANNER REPORT Agugust 29th 2012,"hi scanner fans Bridgeport Connecticut areathis is a review regauarding signals in connecticutwhile I could have purchased an 800mhz scannerbut did not,I live 9 stories high keep in mindsignals differ from in side a home from a condoi can recive over 37 channels of nearby analogpolice and EMS some channels on a desk topscanner like for instance 33.46 example recievebetter than a base scanner gofigurehowever if your into ATC air traffic thisscanner is not for you...but my scanner recieveswell for ham radio and weather audio feedsand most of new york frequencies ..only flaw is the adaptor is on the right handside vs the left as it should have been..For now and present time till i can afford sdigital scanner this baby will do fine..it's worth it till then"
5,scanner,GREAT!!!!! VERY HAPPY WITH THE SCANNER. HAVE OWNED SERVERAL OVER THE YEARS. THIS ONE RATES EQUAL OR BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONES I HAVE OWNED
5,very pleased,"We were very pleased with the product and the management of the product coming here. I would highly recommend this store to anyone and want to thank them on how we received it. Fast and very protective. Thank you once again, Diane Kirk"
5,BEARCAT SCANNER RATED EXCELLENT,THE BEARCAT DOES A GREAT JOB OF SCANNING COMMUNICATIONS AT LAX.A REAL REQUIREMENT FOR MY JOB.
4,Worth buying simply for the Roxy tracks,"Classic Roxy and Bryan Ferry, taped in a club-like setting. Five performances with the original lineup, including Brian Eno, doing songs from the first two albums. The sixth song, All I Want Is You, includes John Wetton (Family, King Crimson, U.K, Asia) on bass. The only complaint is that the entire DVD isn't Roxy, tho' the T. Rex tracks are fine, too."
2,Not as good as the older version,"I borrowed an older copy of this book from the library to help me with my curtain-sewing projects (I haven't sewed anything since grade 8 which was a while back and figured I needed some guidance). the book seemed so helpful that I decided to buy my own copy. This updated version is nowhere near as helpful as the old. In the old version, there is information about how to thread a machine, what the different settings are for, a more comprehensive section on curtains etc....The pictures are decent and the instructions seem easy to follow though."
5,Great!,I needed this for a class I am taking about clothing construction. The book has clear directions and tons of detailed techiniques.
2,sew-sew,"Although this is a well produced book with lots of lovely pictures, the instructions are lacking for a beginner such as myself. Superfically flicking through the book it looks great, it's only when you sit down and need to do something that you find that this book doesn't equip you with enough explanation of the terms and skills needed to allow you to complete a simple sewing task.It promises much, but it lacks thorough, simple and clear explanations and a beginner will still need other resources to learn how to sew basic things.I don't know who this book is targeted at, as it isn't for the beginner, yet the concepts it covers really are basic and I doubt experienced sewers would get much out of this book for this reason.I guess it's not a bad book, just so-so. I tried to edit this to make it a 3 star, rather than the 2 I initially gave it, as that seemed fairer, but I can't edit the 'stars.' I just wouldn't recommend it for a beginner looking for a how-to reference."
5,a must have,I was new to sewing and bought this book and has made learning so much easier! I would recommend to any beginner!
5,i stand corrected,"i thought this would be remedial information for the beginner, but i purchased it because i thought the photos were outstanding and i'm always building my library of sewing resources. i have been blown away by how helpful this book has been. it far surpasses my expectations, in fact, it has become my #1 go-to reference. really clearly written explanations and instruction for many levels of sewing skill and type of project. it's hard to find books with such incredible photos (i find drawings hard to interpret sometimes!). highly recommended for any sewist."
1,Boring,"This book has nothing in common with Collins or Sheldon. It is long, boring, and stupid. It has too many characters, too little action, and no plot. It is as interesting read as phone book or white pages."
3,"Fast Start, Slow Middle, Predictable Ending","My first Andy McNab book. Really, I expected more of a thrill from a former SAS member with all kinds of ops under his belt. I did like the way it started fast but then it really slows down. Some dicey moments at the very end. I will have to try some other McNab books. Meanwhile I will stick to Stephen Hunter and Ridley Pearson for nail biting thrillers."
3,Crisis Four could have ended better,"This book started out REALLY good but then kinda flopped in the end. I guess you would have to read <i>Remote Control</i> to get some of the plot twists, which is a shame since I picked this one up and thought, well, great, I'm finally going to be reading about Osama bin Laden. I was expecting many more SAS vignettes than were actually delivered in the last half of the book, which is really kinda bad since there is only one real surprise in it.McNab's attention to detail is well and good but I prefer globe-trotting action that goes right to the top rather than two people sodding about in the North Carolina woods. I feel that the last 1/3 is a bit tiring, but maybe it's because I read the whole book in 1 day."
3,Minamata,This was a really interseting book. I liked it very much. I would reccoment this book to anybody.
3,"Spacey, not technical or virtuoso...","The previous review isn't wrong, this CD does set a mood...and if the mood is all you want, then this is a good CD. However, if you are looking for interesting melodies and harmonies, if you are seeking something with an interesting theme, if you aren't looking for mellow or meditation, don't get this CD. Personally, I need more than the repetitive chords and motifs used here, and it is a bit too spaced out for me."
5,Click That Buy Button,"Sophisticated songwriting combines with an excellent sound to produce brilliance. These guys are the kings of Alt Country. Better than Uncle Tupelo, better than Son Volt, better than Wilco. The music is a dazzling mix of rock and country (much like the aforementioned great bands) and the lyrics attack country clichés and reveal the real lives of poor people, with surprising empathy. It's a crime that these guys aren't huge. My suggestion to you, dear reader, is buy every album you see. On this album, pay special attention to the deeply affecting Kerosene (the story of the accidental death of a poor family) and the biting `Wave That Flag' (which attacks knee jerk `rebels')."
2,Not Great,I didn't think this book was all that great. The designs are not really traditional and the charts are difficult to read.
3,Shattered My Image of Goldman,"For Screenwriters, William Goldman is a role model, a hero, or even a god. That is BEFORE reading this book. His cynical attitude really puts into perspective what a hack he is and that he ""just got lucky.""He even includes the first half of a screenplay for us to read and evaluate. It is absolutely terrible... terrible writing and terrible concept.My image of ""can't do wrong"" Goldman is definitely shattered after reading this book. Which, I think, is a good thing. It is nice to know that he is human and can hash out crap just like the rest of us."
5,"An Enjoyable, Surprising Classic","When I first began to think ofreading Anne of Green Gables, I thought of it as a boring, slow read classic. But, as soon as I read its first words and learned the story of Anne Shirley, it captivated me and made me read on. Anne has such a wonderful way of looking at the world and life. She taught me so much. Even though Anne is a fictional character, she still makes you smile and laugh. Luch Maud Montgomery did a superb job at making her fabulous charaters come to life.I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves to smile. It is great for all ages, whether your a begginning reader, a parent reading with your child, or an advanced reader(like me!). This book is a heartfelt classic and I yearn to read all of the Anne Shirly accounts by L.M. Montgomery."
5,A wonderful book,Anne of Green Gables is a wonderful book for children of all ages. I recomend this book to anyone that enjoys reading life stories of one's troubles and challenges. Hope you take my advice and buy this book!
4,Great!!!!,This book was wonderful once you got past the first 30 or 40 pages. This book makes you think about things in a different way. I would recconmend this book to any body.
4,I really liked this book,"Reading about Anne as a girl is a good introduction into the world of Anne as a lady.This book doesn't merit rereading as much as the others, but it's still very good."
5,Anne of Green Gables (The story of Anne),Anne is a livily young girl with red hair. Her red hair is always setting off her temper and getting her into a world of trouble. Nobody can hate Anne for she is so lovable. She has many adventures that are almost unbelivable. You should get this book as soon as possible so that you can fall in love with the firey red head named Anne.
2,"The book was ok, but sad at the end.","The main character in Anne of Green Gables is Anne Shirley. She is an imaginative young girl. I found the story interesting. It was NOT the best book i've ever read. But, personally i do NOT like reading."
4,L.M.'s Anne,"I am reviewing the book Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery. I give this book four stars. I think this book is interesting. There are many loop-holes Anne has to go through, but she is helped along the way. Anne is very courageous I would definitely recommend this book to a friend, but I wouldn't recommend it to younger kids because they might not understand the storyline. I also would probably recommend this book to a library because you can learn many different things. All in all I think this book is a good read."
4,Anne of Green Gables,"Anne of Green GablesAnne of Green Gables is a story about a little orphan girl. Anne is a nine year old girl with wild red hair and a spunky personality. Her wild imagination gets her into trouble even if she intends to do the right thing. Marilia, her legal mother, is hoping for the best out of Anne and restricts her from doing many things. That just prompts Anne to show her mother that she is better than her mother thinks she is. If you like a book about love and adventure, this is the book for you."
4,"Great book, narration leaves a little to be desired.","I purchased this audiobook to listen to while traveling this summer. At first, this book was hard to listen to, for the narrator, Barbara Caruso, spoke very quickly. It wasn't always easy to tell the difference between when one character stopped talking and another started, or when a character stopped talking and a descriptive passage began. However, the narrator improved throughout the book and by the end, I was enjoying it quite a lot."
5,A Literary Classic For All Young Girls,"""Anne of Green Gables"" tells the story of young orphan Anne Shirley and her adventures in life. The setting of Prince Edward Island, Canada is masterpiece and adds so many dimensions to this wonderful classic. This young, carefree, creative, smart and talented spirit is a wonderful role-model for all young girls. I can't imagine my childhood without this book and the sequels, ""Anne of Avonlea""....etc. It's my childhood in a nutshell."
4,A quality military adventure story.,"A good book that takes the reader with elements of the British Army on a WW2 amphibious commando style raid into Africa. Anyone who enjoys military books will find this one quite readable. My only problem is that we are introduced to far too many characters in depth, making it difficult to remember who is who when they reappear later in the story. Overall though a good read."
4,The meaning of life in a deck of cards,After fits and starts I delved into this book not sure of what to find. I was expecting a standard sort of whodunit but was immeasurably surprised. The mixture of philosophy and fantasy creates a wonderfully delicate tale. Hans Thomas and his father start on the sort of beatnik road trip to rescue their mother/wife from finding herself. Hans rides shotgun for the first part of the trip while his father philosophizes from the drivers seat. Hans entertains himself by reversing the names of the towns they pass through. Then one day they meet a small man in a small town who gives Hans Thomas a magnifying glass and a secret message. Hans is forever changed by this chance (?) encounter and it will to occupy him for the rest of their journey
4,An excellent choice for older teens,"David and Jonathan is just another example of how good Cynthia Voigt's work is. Her novels throw you into the minds and emotions of her young characters, and David and Jonathan is no exception. This book may be a little more harsh than her other novels however, dealing with subjects such as suicide, the holocaust, and homosexual urges, but they are all completely appropriate within the storyline and events that take place. A great novel for teens, as well as adults, one that will warm you with the strong bond between these two friends, and also grip your heart with the realistic views, thoughts, and experiences of our youth."
2,This is not a good book for children.,"I checked this book out from a jr. high library, where I teach, after having read several other of Voigt's books. The subject matter did not seem appropriate for the students at this school; it was too mature in terms of its overall depth and its sexual content. I believe that the author was trying to show how the Holocaust changed a young Jewish boy's attitudes toward life and his relationships with other people. Her approach to this interesting topic seemed wrong for her intended audience."
1,A disappointment,"I bought this book for my son (he's 4) without reading the reviews and comments carefully. The reviews are accurate, the age range (4-8) is not. I wouldn't read this to anyone, certainly not a pre-schooler. Totally inappropriate and a real disappointment. What kid (at four) needs to know what ""macho"" means anyways!"
2,not appropriate for a 3 year old,"We have tried to teach our son that not all pirates are bad. Some people are out there pirating other people trying to kill whales and other things. This book is a bit crude and had several things in it that I didn't want to read to my 3 year old. ANd frankly, I wouldn't want to read it to him ever because I just think it teaches him that all pirates smell, do bad things and are dirty."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Smolin's opinions are to be taken seriously and from that point of view this is a useful book. It is more positive on string theory than ""The Trouble with Physics"" -- though the latter was written later and may be more valid. As in ""Trouble,"" the use of rather silly examples and the attempt to dumb the discourse down is rather tedious and overdone -- it does not add to the readability of the book."
2,A bit disorganized in trying to get the point across,"First, this book has excellent and valid information, describing practically all aspects of the newest in theoretical physics. The only down-side is that whenever the author is trying to explain a concept, he would jump from one point to another, in a way that when you almost understand what he's trying to say, you suddenly become confused.I've read ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking, ""Principle of Relativity"" by Einstien himself, and 95% of the physics lectures by the Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman. I completely understood all these books I've read, even when it deals with heavy mathematical areas.I believe this author is quite knowledgable. So, this unfortunate situation must be due to his skill as a writer or communicator. Back in university, I've had professors who have multiple PhDs from prestigious schools, but are simply poor communicators and therefore give students an impression of incompatency."
1,Authentic?,"I was listening to the preview of the track called 'I Have A Little Brain' (which I then heard elsewhere in its entirety) and I heard that the 'robotic' vocals were clearly done with Apple Plain Talk speech synthesizer software, which wasn't invented until the mid- to late-1980's and wasn't shipped with an Apple computer until 1993. So I am a little confused about where the late 1960's/early 1970's dates in the item description come in.'The First Commandment' seems to have a decidedly un-1970's drum loop on it too - I take it that some of these tracks are remixes?The rest of the previews sound awful though, Kingsley seems to have been the less talented of the Jean-Jacques Perrey & Kingsley partnership, anyway."
2,DIY,"ORDER WAS PLACED FOR A 2005 FORD F-250 SUPER DUTY 2D. AMAZON confirmed it fit my truck. Delivery was prompt and fast via UPS.AFTER PLACEMENT ON BED RAIL, DISCOVERED that the top side did not clear the cab height. The top bar blocked the cab rear facing brake lite/cab bed lites.There were only 2 ""J"" shaped bolts to hook into the front pocket as the Ford's top rail cannot be accessed to bolt to the rack's predrilled base.I had to purchase 2 3/8"" carriage bolts, shaped it to a ""J"" to bolt the front pre drilled holes to the bed rail lip to secure the rack.This rack is poorly constructed and not for a Ford Super Duty cab.I intend to modify it by raising it 2"" at the base to clear the top of my truck's cab."
1,Not Hard To Find,"Like Most Reviews Have Stated, You Can Find Most Of..If Not All These On Other Cd's, Such As, Various Have A Nice Day Vol's That Rhino Put Out Way Before These We're Released Back In The Early 90's. So These Are Not Hard To Find."
5,This series kicks butt,"This movie is sad in parts, but really funny in others. Maika has some really hard times in this movie, but hey she can handle it.Out of all the anime I have ever seen, I like The Mysterious Play-Fushigi Yugi the BEST!!!!"
1,Better than Elling!?!...yeah right!,"Read one of the reviews on here, where Giacomo Gates was compared to the likes of Andy Bey, Kevin Mahogany and Kurt Elling (that's right, Kurt Elling: The greatest Jazz Vocalist currently in the business). In the review, he was said to have more style and authenticity than each of these guys, so naturally, I was intrigued.I made the error of ordering this cd, only to find that this guy not only sucked, but was even worse than any jazz vocalist (male or female) I've heard so far. His phrasing approach is dragged and uninspiring. His attempts at scatting sound more like mis-timed ramblings. His band sounds good enough, and are the only redeeming element of the 60 minutes of pain the cd represents to me.I Dunno what his live performances are like, but the cd is VERY unimpressive. I will be selling it as soon as possible, and saving the money for a future Kurt Elling cd. Don't waste your hard earned money on this cd..it's not worth it. spread the word!"
5,Easy,"This product was super easy to put together. It is really nice and looks great!! Based on prior reviews, we bought a better pad because the one that comes with this product is thin."
1,Dressing Table,The Graco Lauren changing table arrived without the hardware. And we are still waiting for the hardware. Ordered the hardware 10/24/2012.
3,"Nice table, wheels unstable","This is a beautiful, and seemingly sturdy piece of furniture. It fix six canvas square totes (3 on each shelf) and it also fits the Summer Infant changing table. However, the wheels are cheap and 2 have broken - separating from their base. Now the whole thing is at a tilt. I'm trying to find replacement wheels because the actual table looks great and fits my space perfectly. I would recommend the table, but don't install the stupid wheels."
4,I like it! Good place to change LO and hold stuff,"Most people wondered why we bothered with a changing table, and well, it holds stuff. It holds wipes, diapers, and bins of hair things along with all of our prefold diapers that we use for everything. It is a good height for me (5'3"") but on the short side for my husband (6'4""). I did buy an external changing pad, which makes it much more comfortable for LO."
4,nice item,This is a very nice sturdy changing table. I love the color. The shelves are nice to put extra items on.
3,"Amazon rocks, Graco's quality & manufacturing does not.","We ordered this changing table and it arrived quickly, within 1 week. Thank you Amazon. Unfortunately when the item was unpackaged here at the house there was a 10"" crack along the top of the side support. Amazon sent a UPS driver the next day to pick it up and a new changing table was already in the mail less than 24 hours later.I was disappointed in the manufacturing of this changing table, but not in Amazon. They remedied the problem within a very short period of time. Hopefully the next changing table (that's coming tomorrow) will be in better shape than the one we sent back."
5,Value fr ur buck !!,"I bought this table cos of the affordable price range and am so proud of my purchase , I used bins for storage nd it's been working perfectly for my 9 month old son ever since ... I Plan to use it as a toy storage rack later, so definately a value fr ur buck !!!PS had no odor issues or bad paint chipping off like few of the reviews say"
1,What happened?,"I agree with Jessica Cook. Nancy Drew changed! Why did Carolyn Keene start to write this, what I think, horrible series? The originals were the best, then she did the Nancy Drew files and they were pretty good. But in this series, Nancy and every single other character has changed!!!(I'm writing this after I've read all of the ones published.) Burt and Dave are gone. You're not believe going to believe what happens between Nancy and Ned, and there really are no mysteries! It's become one of the things I hate most, a soap opera! I apologize if anyone is offended, but I think Carolyn Keene should have stopped after the Nancy Drew Files."
4,Look out Wilder University-Here comes Nancy!!,"Bess, George,and Nancy have all been accepted to Wilder University. They are all excited and ready to go. However, things aren't as great as they seem. Nancy's relationship with Ned is on the rocks. Should they stay together? Nancy is also noting that another student on campus, Peter is being extra friendly to her! What to do, what to do? Nancy has some major decisions to make! Definately worth reading. I've read the rest in the series up to number 11. I can't wait to get my hands on number 12"
2,Awful,"I rented this thinking that it was a documentary. Boy, was I wrong. It's edited like a music video. It is shot as if Braddock, his wife and family are all being interviewed during the actual events of Braddock's life. ( Ie. Braddock saying"" I know I ain't gonna get anudda chance like dis"" or a promoter saying ""Dat night he found anudda reason ta fight. Ta save the life of his wife and kids."") Ugh. The film by Ron Howard shows Braddock and his wife to be brave, heroic people. This thing by ESPN makes them out to be self pitying losers. Skip this and rent the Crowe film."
4,not a bad CD,"Theres some good stuff on here, some nice ""feel good"" music and what not. I'd recommend it. It's way the heck better than nashville country, but not quite Texas enough, it's kinda right in the middle."
4,Pretty detailed overview of your truck,"Excellent book for knowing what's what, bumper to bumper with your Dodge Dakota. It covers pretty much everything and has been a big help numerous times with my truck when it comes to finding out small details about certain systems or parts. About the only thing I wish it had a bit more of would be detailed photos and schematics of some of the systems."
3,"holds air fine, but smelly and not round","The included pump is a joke if you want to get this thing inflated out of the box. I used my bike floor pump and it still took forever. But hopefully it's something you only need to do once.The ball I got is not round, and may explain why some folks complain that it's not the advertised size. It may well be the advertised size on one axis, but not another.I've had this thing airing out in the garage for weeks now and it still wreaks of the plastic/vinyl/whatever smell such that I can't stand having it in the house long enough to actually use it. The smell is subsiding though, so maybe in another few weeks I can bring it inside."
2,"Hate to burst your bubble, but.. . .","I was using this as a seat at my computer desk, and unfortunately, it got a slow leak within a week.Pumping it up again did not help, though it is possible I simply received a defective item, or my [persnickety] cat took out its aggression on this ball while I was away.That being said, I CAN tell you that using it as a seat will offer you a good core and stability exercise. I was enjoying the subtle, but constant workout of my abs and lower back, which is why I was so disappointed when it deflated."
2,The Answer is NO,"For the Mountain completist only. I spun this a few times and it's been buried ever since the year of it's release.Comparing this to Nantucket Sleighride is akin to comparing a later day Paul McCartney release to Sgt. Peppers. Leslie is a great guitar player. His songwriting is spotty. There are better Leslie West releases in the past 20 years.In terms of Mountain, get Nantucket Sleighride, Climbing!, The Road... or Flowers of Evil before this. Some of the ""bootleg"" releases sold here (the twin Fillmore East concert from 71, San Bernadino 71, Capitol Theatre 74) are exceptional. That's the Mountain you want to listen to."
5,Timeless!,This is a beautiful masterpiece that has been part of my collection since it was put out.......I highly recommend this wonderful CD for anyone's collection!
4,"Great for a fan of Anderson, Burroughs or Giorno.","I owned this, then lost this and 2000 other vinyl recordings in a flood. A couple funny Burroughs recordings, and a very original editing technique on Giorno recordings. Side 4 had a triple grove, one grove for each artist. My notes do not indicate what the inner grove etching said, might not have had any. If anyone has a copy I would love to know what the etchings said."
5,Great reference book for anyone.,We are owners of a small business and recently we lost our bookkeeper/receptionist after 10 years. I have had to take over collections. This book was of great help to someone who has never gone to court. The book covers both sides of a court claim. This gives you a feel of possible ways the defendant will react and how they might present evidence. I also have had to go to Debtor's Court and the book explained all the rights and thing I should ask for inorder to get the money that is owed to our busines. It covers general information for all state on laws on how long to have to refile etc. Great book for any small business owners who have to deal with the small claims court systems. Five Stars for great reference book to have in your office!!!!!!
5,Hollow Earth,"great book.. must get it. and after reading it, do your own homework on it..There are many more books about it, and YouTube you can get alot of infoabout it.. It's unreal how you NEVER hear about this in school..! The more i learn, the more i seeSchool is a joke to what TRUTH is..."
3,"cupcake carriers sometimes don't ""carry""","I bought these hoping to be able to use them to safely transport some delicious cupcakes to parties, get-togethers, and special orders from friends and family. They seem like a great idea, but the indents where the cupcakes fit are just a tiny bit too small! I only use regular cupcake pans (standard size), but my cupcakes seem to be a bit too wide for the indents. I have to sort of squeeze them in or else they will tip right out as soon as I move the container. Hmmmm - maybe they could re-design with a slightly larger opening - then these would be perfect! Great price, though!"
5,These worked great for transport when in a box.,"I bought these inserts because I needed something that would keep cupcakes from sliding around in boxes during transport. These worked great! I need to let people who buy my cupcakes though, to bring them back! They are a bit pricey (in my opinion) to just go in the garbage after being used once. Nice solution - I like them better than the cardboard inserts with holes in them."
5,Good Book for a young child,My 4 year old loves this book because it has good illustrations of each dog which makes it easy to identify them.
2,They are ok,"Soft and pretty sheets, even though they are not queen size, they run smaller and more after first wash, something that never happened with any other sheets I've bought so far. The color gets lighter in time. They are ok."
5,How to be a Jewish Mother,"The book was in a good condition and arrived a lot earlier than promised, no complaints."
1,Cost me a once in a lifetime trip to Rome!,"I purchased my new SanDisk Ultra II 256 MB CF card in April for a trip to Italy in May. I filled the card up with pictures (Canon Elf) and all seemed well. I was able to review the pictures on the camera while in Rome fine. When I returned to the States, the CF card was unreadable by any computer. Even a Data Recovery company said it was corrupted beyond recovery. I seem to have lost about 80 pictures of a once in a lifetime trip to Rome Italy. Thanks Sandisk."
3,Great!! BUT GET THE ORIGINAL IF YOU CAN!!,"'OUT OF THS WORLD' without doubt has one of the very best Musical Scores Ever!This production, though very enjoyable, sadly does not compete with the very original.Try if you possibly can and obtain the CLASSIC ORIGINAL RECORDING, and discover what the Real Broadway Musical sounded like - 'Pure Magic'.Should you not succeed, then this recording will suffice."
1,DECEPTIVE MARKETING,"The title of this is deceptive marketing. It should be a crime to mislabel an album like this.These are not ""extended"" versions by any means, but simply badly recorded live versions. The only ""extension"" is the addition of alot - did I mention ""alot""? - of audience noise. A complete waste.Buy the individual albums or Greatest Hits instead."
4,Team Rocket blast off at the speed of light!,"Includes the first three episodes: ""Pokemon, I Choose You!"", ""Pokemon Emergency"" and ""Ash Catches a Pokemon"". In the first, Professor Oak gives Ash a Pikachu and he starts his journey, and is chased throughout Route 1 by carnivorous Spearows. Pikachu defends Ash, and then Officer Jenny takes them to the Viridian City Pokemon Center to help Pikachu regain.....I think I've said too much. Awesome, dude."
5,insightful and thorough,"This is a great book. The book is about a man and his struggle with his faults. The characters in this book are amazingly developed. I felt that i understood the characters and their decisions. The plot of the story went along amazingly with the development of and between the characters. Winter wrote this book so well. This is a book that I will reread.PS The book is based on Rockwell Kent's life, but that doesn't limit the book. The book's main idea explores Rockwell Kent as a man, beyond his career.PPS If you read this book and are interested in Bob Bartlett, there is another wonderful historical novel, The Ice Master( Don't judge a book by its title), by Jennifer Niven. It's a great book."
2,Thief of MY Time,"This is one of those unfortunate works that start excellently, even audaciously, take risks, but suddenly fall precipitously to an ignominious conclusion. My hat's off to Pratchett for his brave invention, but in this case the results are mixed.The jokes, puns, take-offs, etc., fly about in rapid-fire, but the author's coyness eventually becomes tedious, and his characters cease to convince. In fact, the best ones--Igor, for example--disappear from the real action in the last third or so of the novel. So does the author, actually; toward the end he seems to lose interest and merely outlines a denouement. Quite a letdown. . . ."
5,Great gift for Father's Day,"I enjoyed reading and re-reading this inspirational book of short thoughts for fathers. This book is a very easy read, its advice and insights make complete sense. This books supports the values that everyone, not just fathers, should ascribe to"
4,excellent,"I love this measuring jug. It measures up to 3 1/2 cups. I found another jug also made by Portmeirion which does not show the cup measurements and only has ounces on the inside. I am glad that I bought the one that has both. The measurements are slightly different from my Pyrex cup measure though, so as long as I use this for the entire recipe, it does not matter."
3,Completists only,"If you simply must have everything by Pete Brown, this will suit you. His singing on this compilation of later work is vastly superior to his efforts with Piblokto and the Battered Ornaments, but sadly, most of the songs,(and remember, these have been chosen by Brown as the best of several albums) lack the raw charm of his early solo work, the sparkle of his earlier lyrics, or the musical inventiveness Jack Bruce supplied. In many ways, these tracks are competent but ordinary.Oh for a disc of Brown revisiting some of his melodically striking and less lyrically narrative compositions."
5,Book,Great book for my daughter's classes. She would highly recommend this book for anyone taking this class or even this topic.
1,Zero Stars Doesn't Seem to Be an Option,"As the old adage tells us, ""If you can't say something good, then don't say anything at all.""With that in mind, since a review would be pointless if I said nothing, I must obviously say something positve about ""Skills of the Vagabonds.""Hmmm....let me think a moment. OK, ""Skills of the Vagabonds"" gave me my first opportunity to try out Amazon.com's return policy.Oh my, I'm feeling generous now that I realize I will be able to recoup some of my losses. Here's another positve thing about ""Skills of the Vagabonds"": the cover art is not terrible.That pretty much exhausts the positive aspects of this book, so I shall say nothing more."
4,"A well crafted, fascinating story.","Time travel has always fascinated the human spirit and captured the imagination of not a few writers. Jack Finney may be the most well known and capable at his craft, but Peter Delacorte earns high marks for this story of time travel to the 1930's Hollywood. Delacorte has grappled well with the consequences of travel in time and leaves much unanswered, which is as it should be. The Hollywood of yesteryear is captured here in small nuances that do more than descriptive prose. Not many books willwake me at five in the morning for a good two and a half hour bleary eyed read"
1,Trouble from the start,"The first hurdle you have to overcome with this book is accepting the fact that the best use for a time machine in 1994 is to go back and prevent a two time, democratically elected president from being a two time, democratically elected president.Once you get past that, you have a pretty shallow story. The lead character isn't very likeable, there is no character development and the circumstances surrounding young Dutch Reagan's second passing are just plain silly.On the bright side Mr. Delacorte does a fine job taking the reader through the golden era of Hollywood and the Los Angeles area circa 1938.In summary, if you hate Ronald Reagan this book is for you. If you're looking for a good piece of fiction then look elsewhere."
2,Definitely not a page-turner,"I just read Hill's latest book, ""The Woodsman"", and it was very good. The characters were well developed and interesting; the story was fantastic.This first book (""A Clubbable Woman"") in the Pascoe and Dalziel series was rather boring. Uninteresting characters, including Pascoe and Dalziel, dull story. Knowing something about rugby and the local English dialect and slang might make things a little easier to follow. I'm a Henning Mankel, Jo Nesbo, and Michael Gruber fan, so this series just doesn't cut it for me, so far. I hear it's a fairly popular series, and I'm willing to try one more novel in it. But to stick with it, the next book better be much improved."
3,"Suction is not what was expected, but it got the job done","I used this to drain my power steering fluid, which I know is not that thick, but the fluid would flow out of the gun pretty freely. I had to hold the gun horizontally to slow the leak. It got the job done, but for such a heavy tool (as compared to the plastic pumps) I thought it would be more effective."
3,Nutmeg Shavver,I found this Item to be very useful.it saves time and money as there is no loss of NutmegI liked the Nutmeg Shaver so muuch I purchased one for a friendwho is still thanking me
4,"Detox programme works well, but format could be clearer.","I've used this book's detox programme twice, once six years ago and once this month, September 2004. I've found it really effective. The first time I did it I felt great, plus I lost 16 pounds and 2 inches off my waist, and kept it there for 4 years! So I recently detoxed again because I do like cookies etc! It worked well again. I found the book's format was very readable, and the articles for each day were interesting. For the daily menus during the 21 day prgramme, I would have preferred it presented more in simple lists and tables, not so many wordy paragraphs. I had to search for the information and write up my own schedule and shopping lists. But that's not much work, and if you really want the detox to succeed, it's worth that effort. Very good; reccomended."
2,They can't all be winners,"While I consider Westerberg to be an incredibly talented performer and songwriter, his solo contributions have really been hit or miss for me. Folker is no exception. There just doesn't seem to be much there. Where 14 Songs, Stereo, and Eventually all had some standout moments, this album seems to hum along without much ambition."
3,Helpful diet guidelines & good recipe ideas,"Includes helpful and easy to understand information on diet and exercise for diabetics and those who are watching their calorie intake. These recipes were probably developed before all of the new research being done on the unhealthy effects of artificial sweeteners and additives. Most recipes involve opening cans of soup and vegetables, but I have been substituting fresh produce and homemade soups. I have also been substituting stevia for the sacharine called for in the recipes and feel much better about what we are eating. My husband appreciates the flavorful, stick-to-your ribs meals that I prepare using this cookbook, so it is titled well and I will continue to use it."
2,Cook Book,I'm not too excited about this book. Most of the recipes in it are things I wouldn't want to eat....
5,The Wind Singer,How the Wind Singer is Sooooo GreatIt is a great book to read because it takes you out of a non-magical world to a different world where there is a great evil to defeat and to find the key to make a town happy. This book is about two twins who live in a town called Aramanth. In this town you have to take tests to tell where you and your family start living and which school to go to. The only way to stop the test idea is to get back the key to the wind singer. This book was a exciting one. I think that everyone should read it.
5,excellent,"The Wind Singer is an awesome novel about two young twins who must save their land from the evil beings called the Morah. This book is very well written and moving, as well as fun. From the moment I picked it up, I could not put it down; it is a very enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it to anyone grades 4-9."
5,Microfiber Washcloths,"I'm hooked! The microfiber material is wonderful - soft, superior in absorbency, and super fast-drying. The ""linen"" color is a nice, neutral, earthy tone. More compact (less bulky) than the typical washcloth, these are easy to pack and make great travelers. Now I must try the matching microfiber towel products!"
3,"VARIETY OF TOPICS, BUT UNDER EXPLAINED","Like one of the previous reviewers said, the author under-explained lots of sample codes. Readers are left wonderred and puzzled. Good side is that it covers quite a number of major topics. But you may find it hard to understand due to lack of explainations."
1,A terrible book,"They should have named this ""1300 pages of (...) Unleashed"". There are very few sections in this book that give even a basic example of how to create or implement the things you are reading about. It seems like they cut and pasted hundreds of small articles together and called it a book. There is no flow to the book, making it impossible to read. Half of this book is just a bunch of useless definitions. I bought this because it claims to cover an impressive number of topics, but that coverage is some of the worst I've ever seen. A complete waste of money."
2,Worked well for a while,"I bought one and it worked well while it lasted. After two years the thing seems to be broken, and frequently resets on me for no apparent reason. I used it heavily and had exposed it to rain but if you buy one it may only last two years."
1,look nice but didn't work,"I bought it because I needed a computer during the bike run for a triathlon. I received it, I installed it. It worked for one ride and then never worked again. I received it two days before the race. It worked the day before but not during the race. I was very disappointed.This computer may work for a little while but it is still a cheap product.Very disappointed and I don't recommend it."
5,A good product,This is my second one and I gave this one as a gift and the first one I use myself. I love it and is very user friendly.
2,not too impressed,"This is the book to the tv program ""The new Explorers"" about dolphins. I haven't seen the program on tv but the book is basicly aimed at children. Reading this book I get the impression someone who isn't good at writing anyways was trying to write simple so young readers would understand. Sometimes it is at the level for a 6 year old, other parts are written more complex that this age group wouldn't be able to fully understand. Many of the photos are stills from the video tape and hence the quality is poor. All in all the impression I have from this book is not too positive. To me it looks like a sloppy job to get some secondary sale from the TV program. I've seen better books for children about dolphins."
3,Changed the Formula,"Ordered this twice. First time was the old formula and loved it. Second time I ordered it was the new formula and I don't like the taste of the new formula. The new formula has a new packaging. Some stores still sell the old formula, but not all flavors."
2,DIFFERENT CONCEPT,The idea of basing a novel off of dreams is indeed different. I was caught off guard initially because I did not realize when the character started dreaming. My bookclub read this book and as a former resident of Indianapolis I wanted to be supportive of Ms. Johnson. The questions for discussion in the back were hepful for my bookclub. I did not care for the style in which it was written but I think she is a good writer.
4,Keeps It Innovative,"John Reuben is a great talent. The question ""Can Christian rap be done well?"" has been answered. Yes it can. But will it still be edgy, sharp? Yes it will. Will it actually sound good? It sure does.Reuben writes his own rhymes, and they are at times funny, introspective, sobering and always catchy. I love the creativity, Reuben weaves through each track of this album. You feel like you get to know him.His first track tells the listener that he always wants to keep it innovative, and I have to say I havn't heard an album like this one before. If you like rap, good rap, and you're tired of hearing about money, sex, drugs and violence, here's your album. Rap can be inspiring, and still be sharp. Give it a try."
2,Cheap and short,Price was right but cord is ridiculously short. Picture is deceiving. Look at second one with curly cord. That's what you are getting.
1,One of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.,"I only watched this because James Earl Jones was in it, and I think no actor in the world could have saved it.The cinematography is so dark that you have to think that they had no budget for lighting.And there's no plot. Two gangs joint their forces to defeat an evil corporation. That's all.I know there's a MiSTing of this abomination. I'd love to see it."
5,Everyone scoffed at me,"This was the first protein Skimmer i ever got when I started in the hobby. I didn't know any better and when people would ask, and I'd tell them I had the lee's counter current they would scoff at me.I have had 4 skimmers since this one. All in the $100 range and all 80% LESS effective than this one. I've had the prizm, the excalibur, the coralife... I am now wanting to try the backpack, but if I ever get a sump, this baby is going in it! If it weren't an internal skimmer I'd already have another. I just don't want to look at my skimmer in my display tank."
3,For the price,"Its ugly,,,,Plastic was a little messed up when I got it.It does work good.But it is hard to keep the setting on it right.And I wish I had the instructions in Japanese... (No joke,,, My wife has no clue how this thing works.)"
4,Honky,Nice to see that something is out so those of us that have followed Simon since the 70s' have something new. Simon has been heard in the background for many years in film and hasn't gotten his due credit. Good buy for a Blackwhip thrill band fan
3,This book was....................,"Bless The Beast And The Children was a OK book............. This book was about 6 adolescent and there mission to survive at camp and ageist themselves. Cotton, Goodenow, Shecker, Teft, Lally 1, and Lally 2. This is set at Box Cannon Boys Camp and in Arizona.The campers all despise them. They are the low dogs at the camp the bed wetters, But thats all about to change because they are about to rise up and prove themselves to them and themselves. They are all have been called losers,dings,stupid and rejects...But Cotton isnt going to stand for that so he gathers up his crew and the adventure begins. This book a very ok book if you ever had time I would recommend you glance at this book because its a worth while one time reader book."
3,"I found ""Bless the Beasts..."" to be a fine novel.","Dispite the difficulty following the story through the flashbacks, I found ""Bless the Beasts and the Children"" to be a fine novel. The flashbacks actually serve two purposes. First, they establish the unique characters of the characters allowing us to see for ourselves why they are considered ""dings."" Second, they give us an insite into what is in their minds."
4,A very good book,"This book is about 6 dumb ruthless rejects that are worth nothing. John Cotton is trying to prove that they arent just bedwetters. They prove this by doing something amazing. THEY SAVE BUFFALO!!! But this ends up happening with a horrible ending. From a run in with a hillbilly to running out of gas, they went throgh alot to prove themselves. Cotton at home was sent here because of some of the stuff he did, for example, he despised his mother because she was trying to be you ng by wearing makeup and all that. Teft got sent here from stealing cars and shooting stuff with rifles. This takes place in arizona. I think this mainly a good book. Oh yeah, the point of view was in third person."
5,A book to be read by genuine readers only,"I read the other reviews for this novel and discovered that the ones who rated it boring or with a low number of stars failed to mention any other critique besides ""flashbacks were hard to understand"" and ""misfits 'fitting'together was unreal."" Apparently, we have ""readers"" who do not do a lot of reading (as evidenced by their own words) and readers who don't really know ""how to read."" (Do movie flashbacks give them problems also?) The book is a narrowed view of a growing population of ""misfits,"" poignantly written without ""tearjerking"" compassion. It bares the truth of both the ""misfits"" AND the ""normals."""
4,A good entertaining read...,"Well...in 8th grade my whole class dreaded seeing this book placed before them as they learned that they had to read this book. As we glanced at each other walking out of the classroom....we all knew that we would wait unti the last minute to read this book. My english teacher (seeing that everyone wasn't reading the book) decided to force the class to read the book for the whole period. We all got into it....and suprisingly really enjoyed the read. Glendon Swarthout can write description so well in so little words...that...it doesn't make the book boaring. However, once or twice you can get thrown off by the flash backs... but... my advice to anyone reading this book is that after every chapter...REALLY THINK about what you just read!"
2,Classic Red - REALLY?,"This is an ugly dark purplish pink, no where near red even though it says Classic Red on the label.Also it does not feel moist, it feels dry after just a few seconds. Very disappointed."
1,"Good product, just too pricey.","Since I could not post that the product is too pricey at the recently raised price I'm going to lie and say it is nicely priced so I will not get an e-mail telling me my review could not be posted because I put truth, and was well within all guidelines with what my review said before...I gues you have to say something good to get a review posted? SAD"
1,janet's losing it,following mike;s footsteps this shows anything can sell now this is one of the worst songs this year next.
2,This band has fallen and can not get up,"I seen Deep Purple about 8 or so years ago and the show I seen blew me away, They put a wall of sound up that you could feel rattling your back teeth, They where coined as being the LOUDEST pop band by the Gunniness book of world records. What I seen on this DVD sounded like a bunch of Nancy boys, I know they are a bit older and longer in the tooth but listen to Perfect strangers, where is the drive behind that song that we all fell in love with? It sounded like the Hansen brothers and not rocks loudest band. Where there should have been pounding guitars there was tapping on the keyboards. I guess they got old."
2,don't bother...,"Deep Purple Stopped growing and stretching as a band shortly after Purpendicular. I kept buying, because it was almost habit-like to buy the latest DP product. No longer. As musicians, all the members shine. Especially Paice & Glover. Morse has begun to bore me. Airey is a wonder on the keyboards, but really adds nothing to the band. Together, as a band, there is no longer any spark or passion in the playing. Just a simple going through the motions play it safe feel to the performance. Even the ROTD material, which sounds and feels better than on the studio recording, is nothing to get excited over.Deep Purple has been a part of my life since I first heard Pictures of Home from the Machine Head album. I've enjoyed their music through the various Marks, including the Joe Lynn Turner line-up. But no more. I will not let them collect royalties from my purchase. There's just nothing there any more...I'll miss them..."
1,Wouldn't buy another,"I've owned 3 of these watches and all three are broke. First one just stopped working, had the battery changed, still doesn't work. Second one one of the hands fell off took it back and got the third one, which now has the same problem.Biggest problem was the third one broke while in Jamaica leving me not know what time I need to be back on tour bus, so I ended up at the bus an 1 1/2 hours early. Looks good though."
4,Perfect,"Banana plugs make connecting speakers to the amp so much easier and cleaner. Since these are separate they can be used regardless of the distance between the terminals. These are affordable as well. Sure you can buy Monster banana plugs, but why would you want to spend so much money for plugs that are NOT that much better. Of course if you have too much money and don't know what to spend it on then, by all means, buy Monster.Make sure that you realize that these crimp-on. That means you need a crimping tool, they can't be easily removed and they cannot be reused. On the other hand, they look cleaner than other plugs.They are all-around good plugs."
3,"Decent picture quality, horrible design.","I purchased this a long time ago, so it's not fresh in my mind, but I do remember being surprised at the video quality, meaning it was far better than I expected. Don't misunderstand, it's not nearly as good as say a $75 camera, but it certainly rivals those in the $30-$40 range when it comes to picture quality. However, the design of the product leaves much to be desired. Other than being quite unattractive, it's not what I would call stable. It doesn't clip or hang onto anything, you just kind of set it down on some flat surface and be careful not to bump the cord or you'll knock it over. It was extremely inexpensive, so if you are on a tight budget, think you have a good place to set this camera down at, and want at least decent picture quality then you might be satisfied with this camera."
3,Pretty Good,This book has a lot of recipes and they are all pretty easy but not all are very good. It hasn't helped me with my picky eater much either.
4,Beyond Macaroni and Cheese,"I thought this book was a good help in coming up with different ideas for dinner. I think it is geared for older kids though.If you are stuck in same rut of chicken, noodles and canned green beans this book will help out!"
1,LIE!!! DOES NOT WORK FOR SP101!! THIS IS NOT A .357 SPEED LOADER!!,"These are too small to be .357. They are a 6 round speed loader, therefore you can not use them on the Ruger SP101."
2,poor sizing,"I have probably 50 pairs of shoes (or more). They are ALL 9M. I ordered a 9M in these shoes--much too small so I returned & ordered a 9 1/2M. They were also too small but I kept them anyway, because I did not want to pay for shipping again. I was charged for shipping -- this should have been an even exchange. Not satisfied. I would have needed a 10M in this shoe. I have NEVER worn a 9 1/2 or 10. These are definitely not sized properly. They were made in INDIA."
2,skip skimo,"ok, Eskimo is said to have exerted a very important influence on ambient music.ok, Eskimo tells us an interesting story, at the same time funny and trascendental.ok, Eskimo is usually considered one of the masterpieces of The Residents, a very original band which really makes the music they feel like.but... can this be listened? many people say it can, and i respect it... but I can't listen to this album, really, without getting bored and bored and bored and bored..."
3,Decent.,"The book was a great price, but every single page that I needed for class was torn out of the book. I obviously didn't realize it until I needed the pages to complete homework."
5,Military Doc's must have it,"As a Flight Surgeon in the Army, I have traveled with this text from Korea to Bosnia. It is a must have for anyone in Primary care and especially military physicians on deployments, where Orthopedic surgeons are hard to come by. It is a clear, consice treatment based book. Which guides you through the physical examination, diagnosis and managment of common orthopedic problems. In particular it lets you know what the red flags are for further evaluation and consultation. Truly Magnificent!"
4,Get the right size and know what you're getting,"First, here is the sizing chart found on the garment itself:Small: 29-31"" Waist and 30.75"" InseamMedium: 32-34"" Waist and 31"" InseamLarge: 34-36"" Waist and 32"" InseamX-Large: 36-38"" Waist and 33"" Inseam2XL: 38-40"" Waist and 34: Inseam3XL: 40-43"" Waist and 34.75"" InseamI think the sizing chart from Amazon is slightly wrong and got a size too small.My opinion about the pants is mixed right now, think I should give them a running chance. But the double-lined mesh is stitched independent of the pant liner, which is sort of annoying for me to put on. I'm shorter than average, so even a regular length is somewhat too long for me. The liner fabric doesn't seem to stretch too much before it might rip. It does have two pockets, drawstring, and zippers on the bottom of the pants for ventilation. The liner is somewhat windproof but not waterproof."
4,Great book!,"Great book...you've GOT to read it if you like Tamora Pierce books. One of the best...no, Alanna was better, but Kel sure is cool!"
4,Cool but not the best.,Don't get me wrong I loved the book and thought it was great but it could have been better. Tamora Pierce did wonders with this book and I'm expecting a knock out 4th book (knowing her the 4th book will rock 5X more then the 3rd book). If you loved her books so far then you msut read this. There are alot of surpises for you as you read and you won't beable to put the book down.
5,Love love love this book,One of the best books ever I makes you smile laugh out loud and at some parts it makes you want to cry a little. It's a book you will enjoy read again and again.
5,Squire - The Best Book Ever,"I have read hundreds of books in my life, from Alison Lester with the Quicksand Pony to Harry Potter, but by far the best book I know of has to be squire by the best author Tamora Pierce. I have read all of the Tamora Pierce books and not once have I wished that I wad doing another thing or reading another book. Not one of Tamora's books have taken me more than 6 days to read, and I do regret one thing, and that is that I now have to wait for the next book. What a pest!So, no matter your age or gender just read this book and you will only regret it ending and you waiting for the next one!"
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"Though the other books in this triology were quite good, this one in particular disappointed me. There seems to be no problem going on, even though I'm assuming it was supposed to be the Ordeal. Kel falls OUT of love with her long time crush, developes one on his cousin, but then pushes HIM out of her mind because she starts a kissing relationship with one of her old friends. She didn't even like him that way until he started kissing her, though he's obviously been in love with her for a while. Pierce rushed this story too much, pushing it into a rough finish. The best part, I believe, was the end. Kel seemed to finally gain some kind of ""real"" purpose, but then the book ended. Hopefully Pierce will keep the next book CLEAN, and settle this one's rough edges."
3,not what I expected,"I was disappointed when I read this latest effort from Tamora Pierce. I've read most of her Tortall books countless times, but this one just seemed lacking in direction, as is leapt around all over the country and dispensed with most of Kel's old friends. I think her and Cleon make a cute couple, but I'd watch this space for Dom if I were you! It's got plenty of action and pace, which is good, but the Chamber of Ordeal part was, as far as I saw, a complete anti-climax, and just seemed trying too hard to set things up for what may come in ""Lady Knight"". Anyway, for all the griping on my part, it's a enjoyable read, though I think it will improve with further reading. So off I go to read it again..."
4,Squire,"Squire is an exciting piece about Keladry of Mindelan whose determination to become a knight helps her endure the threats of conservative knights during her four years as a squire. Kel's dream of serving under Knight Alanna dies as she serves for the good-natured Knight Raoul who deals with raiding centaurs, invading Scanrans, and other law-breakers of Tortall. Exciting and irresistible like all the other books by Tamora Pierce, Squire is a must-read for fantasy-lovers or those who likes the never-ending combat."
5,GREAT BOOK!,i absolutely positivly adore this book! it is fantastic . read it today(if you have read the rest of the quartet)I am totally in love with CLEON!
5,The Book is excellent as any of her others!,"I have just finished reading her book and I can say I'm just as satisfied with this one as I'am with any of her other books. I'm left hanging waiting for her next book to come out. She is my favorite author out there and she will continue to be. If you haven't read some of her other books, I would recommend reading ""Alanna: The First Adventure"" and you'll get hooked on her books! She is an amazing and well descriptive writer and I hope she continues with these amazing stories!"
2,What happened?,"Well, I bet I'm going to get a ton of complaints about this, but I didn't like the book that much at all. Kel doesn't have a consistent enemy to fight against...Joren crops up occasionally during the book and Kel has him taken off her hands by outside means. Many of the issues in the book (i.e sexism, class divide, sex) are cliched and tell me nothing new. Kel doesn't have half as many things to struggle against (unlike Alanna) and her character isn't interesting enough to sustain my interest. Oh, and the gift giver thing was boring. Everyone I knew thought it was ALanna, and it was. Wow. Sorry, but this book is far too issues-driven. I hope Lady Knight will be better! Oh, but I did like the way Kel had several different crushes to contend with, the trial was good, and I liked the way she confronted the Chamber as it built up to her final confrontation with it."
3,"have liked her earlier books, but . . .","I really like all of Tamora Pierce's books except this one. It seems all very rushed, unlike 'In the Hand of the Goddess', which describes Alanna's years as a squire. I think a few parts of the book are not necessary and the whole thing could have been a bit less tedious if she'd spent a bit more time on it. However, I recommend this to go and get from your local library in case 'Lady Knight' turns out to be better. It's good if you are a slower reader though. I think I may read a bit too fast. Read it before you decide whether you want to buy it, though."
5,"ok people, here we go","Honestly this book deserves more than 5 stars. I could hardly expect anything less than great from Tamora Pierce....but Squire was incredibly great. If you're reading this review, chances are that you've already read some of her books and know that they are absolutely wonderful....so it'll come as no surprise to you that this one is just as good as the rest (if not better). I don't really know what to say about the book itself (except that I loved it of course)....I can't pick out any one thing that I liked more than anything else....its the perfect blend of all the necessary things that make a book so good that you can't put it down. Lady Knight comes out next year, and that seems like a long time to wait, but I have a feeling that it'll be worth it. So anyway, read this book, or buy it or whatever, you'll love it."
4,A Good Book for pre-tean girls,"""Squire"" is a fast pased, action packed book about a teenaged girl named Kendry of middin. It's a very good book because it has none of the long descriptions In adult books (the wight wale etc.) but it still has a rich plot and adult reading levles. Kel seems like a real girl and as you read about her you learn about yourself."
2,sleazy,"Peggy Caserta apparently knew Janis very well, and I have no doubt that she's telling the truth. But Peggy comes across as self centered and unlikeable and I sense that she enjoys throwing mud at Janis. ( I also sense that she was badly in need of money.) I much preferred ""Buried Alive"", which manages to be both unsentimental and compassionate."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Seriously people...if you were a fan of Nsync when they were really popular, you already have all the songs already, so what point is there to buy this? And yeah yeah, we know, Nsync was one of the most popular boy bands of their day, but that doesn't mean that you need to waste money on this crap, regardless if you are a fan or not. For one, this is not even an offical ""greatest hits"" album. None of the guys have even acknowledged this release, and from the way it looks on the cheap album cover, it looks as if this was a rushed released so that Jive can get a quick buck out of this. What happened to the days when GH's albums were released when the artists recorded more than 3 albums? GH's albums used to be something that was kind of like a testament to all their hard work, and reflecting on where they're headed. Now it seems as if GH's albums are released from artists who have barely been around 5 years so they can get a quick pay check."
1,AUUUUUUGGGGHHHHHHHHJH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok im not even going to begin to tell you whats wrong with this. Its the music me and friends hated when we were 12(and still do). WE RAN AWAY WHEN WE HEARD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is just stupid top 40 trash.
2,Nothing New,"If you're a fan, you probably have bought these songs years ago and this realease will be a real disappointment for you. If you are one of the very few people who like Nsync but don't have all three of their albums, this may be a good thing to pick up.The songs are catchy pop music, with the boys singing in tight harmonies. Most of these songs were big hits and show why there's little question that Nsync was the best boy band of the 90's. The trouble is that this CD has a very small well to draw from doesn't offer a compelling reason for fans to purchase it."
5,It's curry-tastic!!!,"I have been a fan of S&B Golden Curry since I found a box in SF's Japantown. I wasn't able to read the preparation instructions since they were in Japanese, so I had a friend translate for me. Then I found it in the U.S. and realized that the instructions he gave me were not at all a translation, but they are better than what's printed on the box. So disregard the printed directions and use my recipe instead! 1 lb. chicken, 1 large onion, 3 medium potatoes (peeled), 2 carrots (peeled). Cut all the preceding into medium-sized pieces. Brown the onion and chicken. Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots. Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done. Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting). Mix well and it's soooooo tasty! Serve over rice or udon noodles. 5 servings? HA! 3 servings for people with normal appetites."
4,Auxilary Wide-Angle Side-View Mirror (Medium),"The mirrors worked better for me mounted on the bottom of the side mirrors, especially when I had them first installed on top and went through the car wash. The right mounted one fell off, but luckily I retrieved it from an eagle-eyed attendant and he put it back on for me on the bottom. So far, so good. As for viewing the road in the blind spots, once you find the exact angle when installing, they work very well. Neck surgery necessitated me having them and for that reason, they're worth recommending to anyone needing them for this."
2,"Great, great, and great!","I picked up this book because I've read things by this author before, so I was curious as to what this story would be about. At times it was sad, but at other parts it was hilarious. I am absolutley in LOVE with this book. Read it, and you won't regret it!"
4,great book on friendship and growing up,I was somewhat skeptic on this book as i dont always enjoy books that involve only letters. But here is a book different than any book i have ever read before. The letters in this book were almost like a way of communication for the characters. Elizabeths mom is gone a lot so they communicate through letters on the fridge which by the way are very histerical. Throught the book Elizabeth gets different letters from many made up associations which made me laugh for minutes on end. The characters are full of life and you almost see yourself becoming freiends with them. It is a great book on growing up as a teenage girl and is you will find yourself laughing along with the characters. I suggest this book to anyone who has a sense of humor and wants to read a good book for teens.
3,Well...,"This book is better than its companion, The Year of Secret Assignments, which went nowhere fast. I haven't got much to say about this book, other then I liked the letter form and the imaginary clubs and groups and stuff."
4,good book!,"I recieved Feeling Sorry for Celia for my birthday from a friend of mine accompanied with The Year of Secret assignments. I have not completed The companion novel howver, i did finish Feeling Sorry for Celia and I really enjoyed it.I deprived it of one star because there were certain aspects that were included that i felt were unnessecary. Over looking those mere five pages, I really liked it and would highly recomend it."
3,Good Album,"Texas group on a Miami Bass label. Slow tracks and a couple of up tempo bass tracks make this very interesting album. However, the album loses steam at the end, and I think they may have made this album too short."
2,hot jazz,This is a great cd not only charles lloyd but also keith jarrett in their early years the live section is so well recorded this is a cd worth having in any jazz collection it is five star value
5,A most joyful noise!,"As it says in the liner notes, Charles Lloyd and his quartet made such a splash at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 that the album became a million-seller, launching him onto the world jazz scene virtually overnight. Many critics over the years have compared him to John Coltrane, but Lloyd, Jarrett, McBee and DeJohnette came more out of the cool jazz tradition that played well to a west coast audience and indeed the world over, as Lloyd would be one of the few American jazz musicians to play in the Soviet Union and Red China. The infectuous rhytmns have a light funky sound, which carries forth onto the additional LP, Soundtrack, contained on this CD which features Sombrero Sam. But, it was Forest Flower that earned his place in jazz, which he played at one major jazz festival after another. Of course Keith Jarrett, Cecil McBee and Jack DeJohnette have done pretty well themselves over the years."
5,good,"Great tennis racquet! I had a Wilson nrage to get back into the game but this racquet is a big upgrade. The racquet still has alot of surface area and is forgiving. I noticed my one-handed backhand got more crisp and powerful with the Babolat, even when it is just a block. As far as my forehand, if you swing with lots of topspin and got power, get the racquet! I do wish I could of chose the tension and strings, but $ not bad for 155.00."
4,After 90 years....,"George Buttrick's book was on the table and in the library of many if not most homes of the faithful in 1920's America. Kindle readers will be frustrated in that its not available on their favorite e-reader. If for no other reason than its print seems to be the size that a sixteen year old would find acceptable. The rest of us, journey down to the local drugstore and buy reading glasses two strengths stronger than normal. This book is an excellent book for discussion groups to study as they attempt to unravel the mysteries of the teachings of Jesus. In the end, your spiritual journey will be better enhanced. But aren't all those modern font enlargements wonderful?Richard Hodgetts Madison, GA."
4,Satisfied,The design makes it hard to identify the name/address on the tags. There is a leather flap looped and secured over the id.
2,I also have trouble with this mill,"I'm afraid I also have trouble with this mill. I have had other salt mills that worked fine, but this one requires constant fiddling to avoid getting either huge grains or nothing."
4,Good value for a sturdy picnic table,"Bought this table a couple of months ago to have in a large outdoor camping/entertainment spot. It will always be outside.The kit came to me undamaged and the instructions were very easy to follow. I chose to build a eight foot table with 2x10s using regular lumber (I stained and waterproofed the lumber post build). Table is quite sturdy and the eight foot table comfortably holds 8 people. I did find that on the benches, there is a decent amount of sag in the middle when being used. I chose to reinforce with 2x4s running underneath the seats. I actually bought 3 more of the kits. My plan is mount the brackets closer together so there is less distance between them for the benches. I hope that this will make the seats more stable...but I will buy 2x4s as a backup as well.Either way, a good deal for a good table. Hope it lasts a long time!"
4,Great skin!,"Totally protects my Pearl. I've had this skin since maybe a year, zero concern. Gives a good grip on the device; although masking the Pearly sexy features it's still a great solution to keep it nice, like new."
2,Disappointing Release ...,"I'm an avid music fan and have heard a wonderful remix of ""Fade Away"" on XM radio on the BPM station. It is a great mix and plays to Sarah's advantage. It's upbeat and her voice blends wonderfully with the beats. I eagerly awaited picking up the cd for similiarly sounding songs. Upon purchase I found none of the songs very upbeat, even the last track (a remix) lacked something crucial. This album felt unfinished and not cohesive. Her voice is either underproduced or unfocused. The songs don't seem to build to anything and drag on much longer than they should. It's very airy and unfinished. I would think sarah would do much better on an all dance album, and recommend she stay away from slower ballads and mellow tracks. Her voice falters and it doesn't sound strong or steady. I say if you're an XMer and are looking for the sound you heard on XM look for a remix or find the remix of ""Fade Away"" on a compilation and save your money on her full length album."
3,moderately good farce,Hot millions is a moderately good farce almost forgotten today. Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith make a lovely couple. Never has swindling seemed so justified.
5,funny,Peter Ustisnov is great as a thief who uses a computer and his ingenuity. The movie is very amusing and worth seeing.
5,A strong read for any fan of the beautiful game!,"This book will take you on an amazing, unlikely journey through the professional soccer divisions in Italy. A must read for any fan of the Serie A, Serie B, or any of the professional soccer leagues around the world."
1,Disgrace,"The nerve of this mindless, ignorant blowhard is so rivolting that I've pitched this rag of a book for good. Who, on earth, does he think is? I'll tell you. He was the genesis of today's arrogant, jock-sniffing sports journalist who takes pot-shots at the men of sport, which is simply the manifestation of extreme jealousy. They will always be a bridesmaid, never the bride. He reads a few books on calcio, believes himself an expert, then has the gall to suggest recommendations to the coach. Once you get past his typical American cluelessness and his oh-so typical leftist rant (i.e. the left's love affair with persons of color), you are left with about 50 pages of a realistic travelogue. As someone who has dedicated 20 years to the ""Beautiful Game"", I resent the fact that I paid one cent for this disgraceful body of prose."
1,Sucks the Life Out of a Great Story,"I agree with the other reviews - McGinniss takes one of the greatest sports stories of our generation, misses the point completely and turns it into a travelogue of an egotistical American's time in Italy. Okay, one star for recognizing there is a story here. However a monkey would have seen that.It IS possible for an American to write a decent football book - see Geoffrey Douglas' ""The Game of Their Lives."" If only the subject matter here would have received similar treatment. There are at least 11 stories that should have been told that will forever be lost thanks to McGinniss' hack job.The only thing that is clear by the end is that Joe continues to marvel in the fact that he is an American that knows a little about soccer. Avoid unless you want the game explained to you from this perspective and anectdotes about Joe's time hangin' with Alexi Lalas. Blech."
5,Great song writing and production,I love the song writing and lyrics on this album. The drum machine sound is incredible (and I am a drummer who usually hates drum machines). Frozen Ghost found the spot where Pop Rock meets art and delivered it in their debut album.
5,Tales of Baptist Daring,"I love the book and my experience was excellent. I got the book in just a few days. Thanks, Eric"
4,Rough Hewn Alt-Country Classic,"What you see is what you get with this Bandera, Texas native. A straight-shooting, hard-working, singing/songwriting country boy with wisdom beyond his years and a Dylanesque edge to his whiskey-soaked voice. His writing soars at times: ""Loving County,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" and ""Indianola"" are stellar first person tales of unrequited love and war. ""My Hometown"" is the gem, a hilarious tale of a young man's ambition and having to come to terms with his own reality of buried dreams. Robison uses uncontrived blue collar commonality with the ease of someone who's convinced it's time to enjoy the fruits of his labors, and it's hard to argue with good old-fashioned hard work."
3,"I enjoy atypical country music, but this just was too quirky","I love other Charlie Robison CDs, as well as those by his brother Bruce and Jack Ingram. However, while this CD breaks the Nashville mold, it was a bit repetitive and out-there at times. I mean, how many songs that involve a woman being ""shot in the head"" do we need on a single CD?"
4,"Very Nice, very mellow",These tracks define the old school ska. Way before rock set its teeth into it. The closest American music gets is probably something out of N'orleans
5,Flawless,"The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon."
2,Yuck!,"I have wideranging tastes in comics from Junjo Ito through Dark Knight to the Ultimate Marvel comics. I also like a ton of manga and anime and some of the kinkier side of that.This, however, was just so gross as to be unentertaining. Some of Hino's work is pretty gross, too, but I guess the combination of such grossness and sex was just too much."
5,Dr. Gartner's Hypomanic Patient,"I am a former patient of Dr. Gartner and a mentalhealth professional as well. In reading his book and then reading some of the reviews( especially the NY Times interview) I began to wonder if we were all reading the same book. I found the book to be entetaining, funny and astoundly accurate. I have treated many patients who are exactly as John describes in his book. I my self have or have had most of the characteristics described in ""the Hypomanic Edge"". When I spoke with Dr. Gartner last week he asked me what I thought, I told him you ""got it right!"". I have long held the view that most of the written material in field is just recycled trivia, completely useless. This book is ground breaking and we need more of John Gartner and less of Dr. Phil and his ilk who write books that are more Jacquline Susan and about as usefull as the novel ""Love Story"".Psychodoc"
2,Exact xat doos,"My cat, Callie didn't like it. Like most cats, she;s picky. But I'll keep trying her on cat food vaAmazon."
3,"Nice try, but...","Well it's Pink Floyd - almost. The idea is great. Pink Floyds music is perfect for a string quartet, but I am starting to believe that these guys were a little bit too much doing ""the busines as usual"". They have done this ""rock music in classic version"" too many times and it comes out here that auto pilot was running it. It's still rather enjoyable but I wish there was more attack in it. More soul and guts. It's far too tame to touch me deeply. Sorry."
2,Boring,This book wasen't horrible but it certainly was not worth reading unless you have to. This book was very slow paced and the most exciting part in it is when a stuff animal blows up(if you ask me that isn't very breathetaking.) I'm in 8th grade and I only would recommend this book if you are in grades 3-5. So to sum it all up I think this book was poorley written and extremley boring.
3,Confused!,Each chapter is from a differnt persons point of view... It makes no since during parts...
5,No More Dead Dogs,"I like this book because it is really funny. I also like how the people take turns talking. I would really recommend this book for people that really like humorous books! I loved the part (that was probably the main part) when he said that he hates when you pick up a book with a dog on the cover and you immedietly think 'oh the dog is going to die, I know it!' I loved this book!Thank you!"
4,no more dead dogs good book,I liked this book it was pretty good I liked for its unique way of doing a boring nothing into a great somthing and it had football players in it. it was a bit of everything myster action plays ect. I dont normally read books (I dont like them) but this I read straight on. I liked alot but I would recomned it to a younger somebody out there mabey 10.
4,Book was what I wanted,"Aircraft Maintenance: For the Airplane Mechanic . Book was recommended by a friend, and is what I wanted. Condition was fine.Ian Harvie"
1,Used to love this product,"Used to love this product, not anymore. Add my name to the list of people who are dismayed at the ""new products"" lack of spice and character. What are they thinking, that people wouldn't notice? At least have courtesy to notify the consumers, also know as your customer base!Time to go shopping elsewhere."
4,Good characterization.,"Rafe Lawless, Viscount Pershing, turned a legal shipping enterprise into a smuggling ring for fine French liquors and wines. He likes the air of danger and intrigues until Rosalind Yardley happens upon his little enterprise. Sibbald Yardley, her father, has made it his duty to seek out and hang every smuggler he can find. Rafe believes Rosalind to be a pampered and spoiled rich girl, thinking only of herself. Rosalind has had three Seasons in London and is tired of everyone telling her how to behave and who is acceptable to talk to. Even though she is the magistrate's daughter, Rosalind has discovered that she finds Rafe Lawless quite to her liking. Bess Willingham has taken two character ideals that are quite often stereotyped and turned them fully inside-out. Thrown in with this are attempts at Rafe's life and a governess who works for the magistrate who has a weakness for good French brandy. Don't miss this winner!"
4,"Good Book, but very Anti-Jobs","People just don't give Steve Jobs his due credit. While I did like this book a lot, the author was going for the more ""excentric"" Jobs as opossed to the real man. Apple would have died if not for Steve's leadership. They now have the most exciting products on the market... this is not just due to luck!"
1,Far too basic,"I bought this book based on amazon reviewers comments and I was wrong. This book is so simple it's not even funny. Just skimming through it, I can not even say that it will help with the GMAT in the slightest way.For a far better math review guide for gmat preparation, I would reccommend the Arco Gmat/GRE Math review book. This book assumes you know how to add and multiply (unlike the ""Ultimate"" refresher) and goes through topics in great detail. I am almost done with the entire Arco book and love how it introduces new topis and gives you problems that range in difficulty - from easy to hard. This is how you build up a mathematical skillset.Not to mention, the Arco book covers the bredth of math-related topics which are likely to appear on the GMAT.Anyone looking to get a serious score, steer clear of this waste of $. Your $ is better spent on the Arco book."
2,Needs more practice problems,"My problem is math doesn't stick with me unless I practice it over and over and over. This book does well at explaining concepts, equations, etc., but it offers very few practice questions. I especially needed help on probability, coordinate geometry and combination problems, and this book leaves much to be desired."
5,if you don't remember any math from highschool,"I use the customer reviews to make purchase decisions often but have never felt compelled to write one until now. I also have the Kaplan GRE Exam math workbook fifth edition and like most of the math prep books I found, they assume a very brief review of a concept will trigger your memory and you will be able to work practice problems. The Ultimate Math Refresher is for those who truly need to relearn the concepts. It doesn't have practice problems like you will find on the GRE but it has practice sections to demostrate the concepts and make sure you understand them. The sections are also short enough for people who find relearning math tedious. I suggest this book for the mathematically challenged and then move on to one of the typical prep books with GRE style problems."
3,"Fair overview, but not always clear.","The book is well organized from start to finish, and builds well on the topics as they are presented. Unfortunately, it often makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge of the topic, usually around formula usage that is confusing and difficult.As a primer for statistics, this one falls a little short."
4,Reasonable for the cost!,"There was a bit of damage more than expected, but that was reasonable.Overall good condition, and quite prompt delivery"
1,Don't buy this item!,"It says fits most cars, I put my year and make in and it stated it fits. I got them they're nice and plush and look awesome, put them on my seats and sat down and both ripped soon as I sat on the seat! garbage, don't waste your money TRUST ME!"
5,Awsome!,"This is one of my favorite cd's. It's right next to my p.o.d. cd. ""Tonight"" is a great intro and maybe the best song on the cd.I like how they mix in some rap into their songs. I would have actually given this 4 1-2 stars beacause some of the songs are a little soft and i like them harder, but 5 works. My favorite tracks are 1, 2, and 4. What i mean is: GET THIS CD!"
2,This album is just ok,This album is a bit weak in my opinion. No real power behind the songs. It goes to that medium level and then never goes any further.
4,PAX217 (Ngage) is WU!! (What's Up)!!,"This is really under rated 4 the music is comparable 2 a variety of music. However, no negative lyrics 2 ruin your life: just positive true words of power and ethics"
1,not worth buying,"This cd is not worth buying at all. I have their 1st cd, and I liked it a lot so I figured their new one to be really good. And when you listen to the 1st song, it picks up right were the 1st cd left off at. But Pax217 fades away from rock in some of their songs. One song What is Love, has nothing to do with a christian cd. If you loved their 1st cd, don't get your hopes up with this one because it's a waste of money"
2,Fits Funny,"This gizmo doesn't fit the hot shoe mount. You have to slide it in on one side where it hangs on precariously while you adjust the tripod. It is functional, but you get what pay for."
3,Tough call,"If you preferred the better developed charactors in the original Clash of the Titans over the ""flashier"" remake, this series might be for you. On the other hand some of the special effects might be even more ""dated"" than that.I found I cared about the charactors so the acting & writing must've been okay. It's def. no Legend of the Seeker in terms of fight choreography & monster designs which are sometimes dismal but it has a heart.There is at least one hot babe in almost ever episode despite no real recurring female role.Another perspective: I liked it better than the 1st movie (Barberian I think) but not as good as the 2nd movie (Destroyer)."
3,Scroll wheel too sensitive.,"Everytime I went to select something with the scroll wheel it would go to the ""present position"" page. Unit was unusable. Amazon refunded my money, and paid for shipping. I have since orderred the Garmin 330 which I love. The extra $20.00 is well worth it."
4,Some Minor Problems,"I have had this unit for about 3 weeks now, and have found some pro's and cons this is my first GPS unit I have owned:Pros:1.Great Navigation2.About 95% accurate3.Very Compact4.Runs on AA batteries5.Easy to set up6.Can add your own POI's (point of interest)7.No maps to downloadCONS1. Suction cup is bad, I wake up in the morning with the unit on my seat or floor.2. Battery life is not as stated. States batteries should last 7 hours, I am lucky to get 3 or 4 from duracell batteries.3. The scroll wheel sucks while driving, (i know, youre not supposed to touch it while driving)4.Have to pay $75 a year to update mapsIn my next unit I would like it to pronounce street names and to have touch screen, and a better suction device.All around it is a good beginner unit."
5,Something I desparetely needed!,"The garmin is great, i use it everywhere i go and never get lost!! It is worth every penny I am so happy I bought it!--tiffiny"
2,Not that great,I have had this product less than 1 month. I will exchanging it on Monday. It has already gone out. It was used less than 5 times.
5,Excellent portable GPS for vehicle,I enjoy the simplicity of this GPS. Also the screen resolution is awesome for the size of GPS. Very accurate and easy to use.I have seen the other large ones and this has all you need.
5,Garmin StreetPilot i5,"We were on holiday in the States and having been totally lost in Phoenix, we purchased the Streetpilot and it was brilliant. So easy to use from the outset. Can really recommend it!"
2,It is smaller than it looks in pictures,"Had to return this since it had many flaws. Yes you get what you pay for, that is not a lot! The screen is small and not touch screen. The set up is clumsy and even had software glitches(may be just mine was defective). I bought the larger full featured StreetPilot 2720."
5,Garmin StreetPilot i5 Automotive GPS Navigator,"I purchased this product two months ago and have installed it in my business vehicle. I perform service calls to businesses in the MD, DE, and VA 5 days each week and have found this navigation device to be invaluable. Prior to owning this device, I would use Map Quest and a road atlas to locate my customers. Unfortunately, traffic jambs, road construction, and missed turns imposed unforseen delays that resulted in wasted time and money..not to mention frustration. Using the Garmin Navigator has changed this for me. All I need is an address for my destination, and I arrive at my customer worry-free, and in record time. When priced under $300, I feel that this product is well worth the investment for users of virtually any income level."
4,Garmin StreetPiolot i5,I bought this as a present for my husband at Christmas time and wish I had gotten one for myself. We tried it out right away and it was GREAT. I love the voice prompt that lets you know how far to go before a turn and also reminds you again before you get there. The voice is great because it saves you from having to look at the screen. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was a touch screen but it is still very easy to use... I recommend this to everyone!
5,streetpilot i5,"worked great, a recent trip to florida the unit worked so well, it kept myself and my wife from fighting on which way to go. The unit gives you plenty of time to get in the right lane for an exit, and if you miss it it will recaulate and tell you the best way after that. great investment."
3,"when its good, its very good and when its bad...","I got my Street Pilot and, initially, I loved it. However, it has now developed a really awful problem. Occassionally and for no apparent reason, the whole thing freezes. It just stops at a given place on the screen and doesn't move, nor can you turn it off - not even if you turn off the car, unplug the unit, etc. The only way I can turn it off and reboot it to open up the battery compartment, take out the two batteries and put them back in. Not too convenient if you're driving down the road. The other annoying thing about this is that if you're not paying careful attention, it can take a while to notice that the system has frozen. I've blown by my turn more than once because of it.Suffice it to say, I'll be sending this back and hoping they either fix the problem or get me a new one. If it worked properly, however, I'd probably give this unit four or more stars. It's easy to operate, a great size, and generally really very accurate."
5,A great purchase.,We could not be happier with this product. We bought it before a summer trip to WV. It helped us find our way to several out of the way locations where there were inadequate signs and a high probability of getting lost. A great product.
3,Suction Cup Won't Hold,"This works great, IMHO. However, it won't stay on the windshield!! I haven't used the permanent pad included yet. Does that help it any? If it does, where do you get another permanent pad? I 've got 2 vehicles."
2,very disappointed,"I was very excited to get this product. A friend had one for 2 years and had not had any trouble. The first one I received, the voice went out after a week. It happens. I sent it back and got another one. it was broken out of the box. I called Garmin and they were no help. so I sent it back. I now have a Garmin c330 only because the other gps units I reveiwed got horrible reveiws. The c330 has worked flawlessly since I got it. I will say this for Amazon, their return policy is excellent. if something breaks within a certain period of time, or is broken out of the box, they will ship another one back to you immediately or in my case, they will refund your money very quickly. I would have no problem ordering from Amazon in the future."
3,It works sort of,"Battery arrived in a plastic baggie, no instructions or anything.It only charges to 73%. Gives me a couple hours, but I was hoping for better at this price. Not happy."
1,Trash,"The product road kings was straight garbage. Whoever produced it need there tail kicked across the united states, im not gonna say that other word. It seems hard enough now a days to find a decent movie that you haven't heard of. You might as well stick with what you know or have already seen otherwise its TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!."
5,The best punk band ever,I would like to say that this cd is by far the best ever......every song is great and the band is great ....If you like punk by this you wont be dissapointed
2,Not very intelligent gambling book,"For how the book's cover talked about how intelligent (ivy league undergrad, law school) the author was, he didn't know a thing about statistics behind gambling. I gamble, but thinking of a dealer or their cards as 'hot' or 'cold' is quite unintelligent."
4,interesting qualitative field study.,"as a grad student, i rarely have time for pleasure reading, but this book caught my eye and i stayed up a little later each night to read a chapter or two. coming from pittsburgh and living now in syracuse i was delighted to see these cities referenced in the book. the author takes 50k (a tidy sum, but in vegas it's all relative) and gambles around town, while at the same time describing his experiences. i thouroughly enjoyed the book. i liked some of the asides better than others; most were all too brief. i also enjoyed the little tidbits of info that the average tourist would not consider or be privy to. towards the middle of the book, i got a little tired of the fact that his wife came to visit. arguably, a single's perspective would probably have allowed some more candid and interesting observations! I can pack my bags and be ready to go right away! buy the book."
2,High hopes...low return,"I purchased this book with high hopes that it would be a sizzling account of a true high roller experience. I have always wondered how ""the other half"" lives it up in Vegas. At the very least, I expected an interesting trip report with accounts of lavish suites and attention showered on this temporary high roller. Although some parts of the book were mildly interesting, there is no meat. I came away from the book not knowing anything more about what a high roller experiences than I knew before I read the book. The tales of the characters he met were somewhat informative and interesting but his account of his attempt at high rolling fell flat. A mediocore book at best. I want the juice!"
5,A really fun book about Las Vegas,I really enjoyed this one. An insider's view of the high rolling lifestyle. Bottom line - the best way to get rich in Las Vegas is to stay home and invest in the stock market.
4,Entertaining first-person narrative,"Andres Martinez employs his own brand of the ""house edge"" over other current Las Vegas books - he actually stayed and gambled at the hotel/casinos covered in the book. Granted, his publisher provided him with a $50,000 advance to be used as his nest egg, but it does engender a bit more sympathy and interest from the reader as we play along with his blackjack and baccarat hands.The book is well-paced, providing the right blend of hard facts, history, rumor and innuendo (which count for a lot in LV), and humor involving his own experiences and those of some unique personalities he meets along the way.Falls short of a 5-star rating due to occasional ""New York City is better"" diatribes. It might be homesickness on the author's part, but anybody expecting high culture in LV is bound to be disappointed.Superior to Pete Earley's ""Super Casino,"" but both are definitely worth a read."
2,Vanilla Pudding,"I wanted to like this book -- the premise is a promising one. But the writing is clunky and the humor precious (the author spends a lot of time laughing at his own lame jokes), the reporting is woeful, and the experiential stuff is so boring that, somewhere, Hunter S. is rolling his eyes."
5,Fast Read,"If you're planning on visiting Vegas anytime soon (you should), or if you have already been there - this is a must-read. Martinez whimsically dashes through a month long frat boy's dream of a vacation. He perfectly captures the heights of ecstasy of winning and the despair of losing and somehow smirks at it all. This is good stuff."
4,"Great fun, not a history lesson","I really love going to Vegas but wouldn't necessarily call myself a ""junkie."" However, its energy and irreverance really get me going. I read this book on the way into Vegas and it really got me in the mood for the experience. Martinez's humor and light-hearted view of his day-to-day exploits really keep the book moving. You feel his pain as his ""nest egg"" fluctuates way up and down from his initial $50,000 advance. I found myself yelling ""STOP WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD"" quite a few times as he went into a couple free-falls (hmmm, I think I've told myself that a few times). He also interviews various Vegas locals to get more of a flavor of the place. I would have liked a bit more details on these locals stories and some of the gambling experiences. All in all, the book is a fun read and definitely help you get a feeling of the wildly-fluctuating experience of Vegas."
2,SURPRISINGLY BORING---,"Hour after hour of the same thing: the heroine being soft-spoken and perfect, the hero feeling inadequate of the heroine and remaining emotionally reserved, tons of mundane domestic scenes and one of the dullest endings I have encountered in a while. It became so very monotonous. Also, the hero was never really brought to life but remained a flat character that never stirred any attachment or reaction from the reader/listener. I found this narrator, Rosalyn Landor(Audible), who usually adds enjoyment to the experience, quite monotonous here too."
2,just ok,"This book was ok, even though the start should have warned me it wasn't as good as the reviews suggest when the innocent young heroine shoots a guy and gets over it really quickly. The hero was likable enough, but the story just kind of meandered around and when he couldn't even tell it was her because she wore a small mask over her eyes, well that was just silly. And then he slips into his cockney accent when he gets upset, but only for a moment as it's just used as an effect by the writer. I just didn't get the real connection between these two, they aren't around each other enough in the beginning to really have one develop so suddenly."
5,Um livro consistente,"Hoje acabei de ler esse livro e achei excelente. Muito bom, com substancia, cheio de sentimentos. A autora nos leva a um maravilhoso passeio pelo surgimento e crescimento de um lindo amor. Vale a pena compra-loAchei excelente"
4,From Slovenia- Ljubljana,"Its diffrent and very active. Derek is a man with a past and he does not belive in happines with a woman who rescues him and becomes carmed with him. He first declines his fellings toward her but she has all the love it takes to brake him in peaces. Couse he realises that she is the only woman in the world besides his mother, who could breake his heart. The story is beautifull and refreshing. Luna"
4,Liked the story - liked the characers,"This was a great story and what I especially loved was how the book continued beyond the ""happy end"". So often romances end with a kiss or an ""I love you"" and it seems too abrupt.I really loved the hero and the heroine - especially the heroine - in this story. And I loved the fact that the book didn`t move too fast forward to them falling in love with each other. It was a slow build for two characters so different from one another.So why not the five stars? Truly this would have had 4,5 stars if that had been possible but it wasn`t perfect. What made me deduct the one star was a bit of a mess in the writing - it jumped from head to head as to who`s thoughts we were following. It didn`t ruin the story, by far, but it was a bit annoying.But I can definitely recommend reading this book. It`ll grip you by the heart :-)"
3,HACKED,"IF MY DEBIT CARD NUMBER HADN'T GOT STOLEN FROM YOU SITE [AMAZON], THIS PURCHASE WHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT!! WON'T BE ORDERING FROM AMAZON AGAIN! AND THAT'S TOO BAD!!"
3,"Good rack for the money, but not the sturdiest","I purchased this piece in order to get our winter coats out of the way and it has done the job! I really like the look of the piece. Only one downfall: it will tip if you're not careful. I wish I would've purchased something with a heavier base. Luckily, it's only gone over once in 2 months and I caught it before it hit the floor.Overall, it's a good purchase for the money. Just be sure to have even weight on all sides."
3,Cute,This is a cute coat rack - perfect if you have a small area or cubicle available to hand your belongings
3,it gets the job done.,"easy to assemble and none of the parts were missing. i followed the directions and felt quite accomplished when i was through. the entire process took less than an hour, or half a glass of wine, to complete. it looks swell to top it off."
4,Good value,I love this product. It arrived very quickly before the holiday season thanks to Prime shipment.It is easy to assemble and can hold up to 12 jackets.
1,ya - this is junk don't wast your money,"The only reason I have not sent it back is because it isn't worth the effort. The problem is that they ship you the wrong parts. The two bottom feet poles are not the same - they are mirror images of one another - and if you actually get two different parts they will lock together and make a nice stable base. The problem is the people putting the parts together in China don't appear to know that. What I got was the same base bracket twice - if you assemble that so that the two pieces interlock you get two feet facing down and two feet facing up. The only way to make the darn thing stand up is to flip one piece over and assemble it upside down. That will work, but it makes for a wobbly setup. That's why some reviews say it works fine and some say it is unstable -- it all depends on whether or not they ship you the correct parts. So, if you feel lucky, go ahead and order this."
4,Saved My (Ski) Bum,"This was super-easy to put together (though I needed my boyfriend's stronger hands to push on the plastic end caps in a few places). Very sturdy and took as much winter clothing/ski gear that I could hang on it. Tightening the bolt on the bottom once every two weeks for the first month ensured that it wasn't wobbly or rickety at all. The ornament-thing on the top is a little weird, so I left it off--though if you like the look of it, it is surprisingly good quality.I took off one star because the arrangement/shape of some of the hooks aren't as useful or intuitive as I would have liked (I never really used the bottom row of hooks).If you like the look of it, go for it--It looks just as nice in person."
2,crappy,"i wasn't expecting much considering the item was only $25 but this is really a piece of junk. my major complaint is that it came with little round caps for the ends of the prongs, but they don't fit; they're too big. So, everytime you go to put your coat on it, the caps fall off. I finally gave up and now there's just a black metal open prong. Ugly."
2,Very Difficult to use,This product is not for novices. The labeling on the buttons is extremely confusing. The instructions are not written for the layman either.
4,Very Good,"I had never read anything by this author before, so based on the different reviews I read on this website I picked it up. It was really very good! It read smoothly and did not lag in any spots. It kept you guessing to the end. Usually, I don't have any problems picking out who did it, but I did with this one. I am definitely looking forward to reading her second book."
2,OK but reject the shamanism and the cult spirituality,"I love Peter Kater and most of his music without occult or shaman titles in them, because the truth is, it is part of a cult thinking and spiritual darkness. I studied it for years as I did other cults and I know people firsthand who were involved with the illuminated cult and ""ism. Otherwise he has an excellent talent and beautiful spirit in music and melodic creation on the piano and you cannot deny that he has a God-given gift, if and when he ever acknowledges that is truly where it comes from. This one is one I would not buy from him simply because it centers around his deceptive occult beliefs. I do not judge but I say this, with such an awesome talent, it would be better if he understood what shamanism really was and took the road that leads to real eternal life. Otherwise his music is really beautiful and I praise his talent for having music that reflects spiritual beauty in other regards of the heart and peace, which is fine."
1,missing pages - buyer beware,"The text is written in a way that explains but challenges the subject of ethics. However, I could not complete an assignment due to missing pages in the Kindle version. After notifying Amazon, they notified the publisher (I think). After waiting time specified by the Amazon Helpless Desk, the pages are still missing. Future Buyers...buy the real book."
3,review,the book was what i was looking for. however it had more cover damage that i was led to believe
3,Avon Glimmerstick,"This eyeliner is Ok... I dont really like it.. It works pretty good, so I rate it a 3.. But it glides on pretty good, but you kind of have to push down, but other then that its prtty good. I rate it a 3. So if you want like a first eyeliner, i would definately reccomend. These are my OWN opinions Btw."
5,My favorite eye liner,I've been using Avon Glimmersticks in saturn grey for years. This is the only liner I now use. Stays on all day and it's easy to apply. Gray color insted of black makes for a less dramatic and more natural look. No melting or caking.
4,"Sharp for a day, blunt for a month","This eyeliner lasts me a decently long time and goes on very smoothly, which I love. My only complaint is that while it starts off with a nice tip, as soon as that tip is blunted, it stays blunted. Because it's not a pencil, there's no way to sharpen it. And even though the blunt tip glides on well and isn't that sloppy, it definitely doesn't allow for much precision."
3,Nice live album,"This is a rather good album which deserves attention from anyone interested in live and/or old school hip-hop. Don't let it put you off that there's only 6 tracks here. The album has normal length because of the playing time of the tracks. For a couple of reasons it's not as good as the ""Charlie Chase Presents..."" Cold Crush album; the sound quality is rather low, and the tracks that appear on both albums are mostly better on the other. An exception is ""Freestylin"", which together with ""Yvette"" are the best tracks on this album. All in all a good album which you most likely will not regret buying."
4,Not as good as Brothers in Arms,"Also, much heavier than ""Brothers in Arms"". They are obviously trying to set up something completely different, darker, new set of characters, etc. Still, it's Weis and Hickman as we all expeceted, and should fullfill anyone's craving for more DL."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I had mixed feelings about this book. For someone who couldn't get through a single Fifth age book, the recaps were helpful, however, i agree that the character development was not too great. I also didn't like how all of the characters had changed in such awful ways since Summer Flame. The last twenty pages are the best in the book and the rest is just blah."
2,"Good Universe, Boring Characters","I was a huge fan of the original Dragonlance Trilogy and the Twins Trilogy. Both of those were great!However, this book is incredibly slow and NONE of the characters are interesting. They aren't heroic, villainous, funny, inspiring, or charismatic.For hundreds of pages, an evil Joan of Arc type character says that something is going to happen and keeps saying that something is going to happen. I'd rather read about something happening. Preferably something exciting.Where is the chemistry bewteen characters?Where are the epic battles?Where are the breath-taking landscapes?Where is the action?Oh, yeah... in the first 6 books, but not in this one.This book was so bad, I couldn't finish it.My breaking point was when Tanis's Son went to a Costume Party dressed as an... (wait for it) ...Elven Ranger.Unless you are a serious die hard fan of Dragonlance, avoid this book."
5,A Surebet Winner!,"I've been skeptical for some time about these Dragonlance books. I thought the were probably silly and just some novels written to try and get you to buy game settings. Well, I finally gave in and read this novel as the story looked interesting, cover drew me to it. I loved it, and I've already picked up now the entire series of War of Souls books, Legends and Chronicles. I've in fact already read 200 pages in the second book in the series now. What a great thrill ride. I'm absolutely hooked, particularly since as I understand it these three books aren't even the best triology in the series.Buy it, try it...you'll love it."
1,No Cover,"So ive read this book before, in fact this was my first dragonlance book that i read. My wife has shown an interest in it and so i bought the hard back version. When it arrived today it was missing the Cover sleeve. Where do i get it?"
4,A must read for all DL fans!,"This book is the first of the WoS series and is not related to Rabe's 5th age series. The story explains how the heros of the old age and the new are trying to survive and cope with the lost of the gods, magic and under the the rule of Dragon Overlords.DoFS goes into great extent to explain what has happend ever since Chaos War and the current leaders of different nations and order. Which is a good fill in for those who have not read DL ever since DoSF.The new characters are well designed and unlike ""The Chronicles"" the characters are much easier to digest since they are spread into small groups of 2-3 rather then a huge group of eight. Which also allows the readers to witness events that is happening on different parts of Anasalon.The most attrative feature of this book is the mystery that are left unsolved even till the very end of the book. If you think that Dragons of a Fallen Sun will solve the questions you have about 5th age, think again."
3,"OK,She is fantastic,but this one doesn't add anything to it.","This is not a necessary buy,once you got all her studio CDs and her Videos...Frankly I do not understand this release...It's the...market...law....I suppose.I love her and her songs,But I'd stick with her studio albums.If you are crazy about her,then buy'Sweet Love-The best of Anita Baker' and 'Baby come to me-The best of Regina Belle' !!!!"
3,Okay,"This dictionary is worth something because it has English to Greek entries. The section with Greek names and proper nouns is also quite useful for pronunciation and reference.That being said, the lack of verb principal parts makes this dictionary rather weak. For students of Ancient Greek it is essential to have access to every verb form. What could be a five star product gets only three for this ""bush league"" error."
5,Great work tool,This calculator is the best for the price. It does it all with regard to finance and mortgage calculations. The directions are straight forward and simple. They explain almost all variations of problems and how to solve them. In no time you understand this unit well. I've worked with others and this one was recommended to me. I'm glad I listened.
3,"It's pretty good, but don't go out of you way to obtain this EP.","I really liked this song (used in a Levi's commercial, apparently), which I actually originally heard on one of my chillout compilation CDs some years back, so I thought that I would pick up the maxi-single EP of it. You can never have too much of a good thing, I usually think. Well, this may just be a little too much of a good thing. All of the remix versions are good, but none of them spectacular. None of them really take the song to that next level or do anything incredibly new or different with it. Fairly safe remixes, so none of them are particularly disappointing, but none inspire either. After just one listen, I doubt that this one has much of a future in my headphones. Spend your money on Smoke City's full length album ""Flying Away"" instead."
5,Hits the mark,"This is exactly the type of timely work that will help us in our own Silicon Valley venture. Well done, and thanks!"
3,Not with the times...,I thought this book was good for milestones and some info. about when the baby is sick etc...but I found it very onesided on alot of issues.....I was especially disturbed by the comment that a teething baby should not be attended to when they cry or they will get used to it...also the comments about the family bed are onsided and you can obviously tell the authors are against it.....It is an o.k. reference book but any of the Dr. Sear's books are less condescending and more open minded......I liked the what to expect when you are expecting but this one I found very disturbing at times.....
3,So-So,"I am not overly impressed with this book. Unlike during pregnancy I have/had NO time to read each chapter. ""20-20"" hind sight tells me I should have read cover to cover BEFORE delivery. Now it's too late. As a result I only use the book as a reference in an emergency at 3am. And even then if a topic is not in the index, forget it. The section in the back on illness is a great table of neatly laid out info and I really only use that nowadays. (FYI. My son is now 4+ months old.) I would have prefered something more organized on the ""trouble shooting"" sections, for example during week 3 when my son had exema looking in the 3rd (or 4th?) month for the info was a pain. I (obviously) hadn't read that far yet."
3,Attachment Parents Beware,"While this book contains much useful information including milestones for each month, and practical medical tips it is not supportive of breastfeeding, baby-wearing or gentle sleep approaches. If these are important to you then you'll be sifting through this book for the information you can use. I'd recommend Gentle Baby Care or Penelope Leach for alternatives."
1,Yuck!!!,"Ok book for some basic information. Condones ""cry it out"", which goes against all mothering instincts. Not enough empasis on how important breastfeeding is"
1,Go with any of the Sears books instead,"I bought this book as a set with ""What to expect When Your Expecting"" and read both cover to cover during my pregnancy. I have since found that quite a bit of the infomation is both outdated and medically bad advice (like leaving your breastfed baby with a sitter at 3-4 months old with only a bottle of water) Also, the cry it out advice is horrid. Buy the Baby Book instead!"
2,What to Expect the First Year,"I was extremely upset with the book. I started out breast feeding my 3 month old at birth and was doing great. Then I came down with some health problems that required me to take medicine that wasn't good for my daughter so I had to stop breast feeding. I understand its great for babies but, some women one don't feel comfortable with the idea or two can't because of medicine. My daughter wasn't having bowel movements like I thought she should so I went to my book to see just how many a formula fed baby should have. All the information they had was for Breast Fed babies. Upon, some other situations that I needed the book for all the information was for breast fed babies. Look up formula in the book there's only 6 subjects for you to look under. I would not buy this book again. The first book I swore by but this one isn't anything compared to the first."
5,I refer to this many times,"I bought this book after a friend suggested it. I was determined that I wasn't going to be a ""by the book mom"". I am so glad I took her advise it's been so helpful."
4,baby book,"this book is very informative and a great follow up to ""What to expect when you're expecting""="
2,What to expect the first year,"I found some of the information helpful, but it lacked a lot of information that I felt as a first-time parent I needed. There were lots of helpful answers to questions people had, however, there were a lot of questions that I think are common everyday questions that were left out. I didn't care for it that much. I think overall, that it was not helpful for the information I was looking for."
1,"Lousy Advice, Frustrating Format","I'm a second time mom after a nine year break--what I needed was contemporary wisdom, and this book failed me miserably. The advice was often outdated and uninformative, and the Q&A format was frustrating because the information provided was tailored to one specific question, rather than a range of topics within the subject.I found myself insulted by this book's suggestion that parents who do not agree with CIO are weak. This book provides some of the worst parenting advice I've come across; I cannot recommend it."
1,I cringed the whole way through..,"I liked the What to Expect When You're Expecting book, so I thought I'd take a look at this one. Boy, was I disappointed!!It gives outdated and inaccurate information on breastfeeding and sleeping with your child, encourages the ""cry it out"" approach and, overall, made me feed very sad for the parent who takes it to heart (and their children).There are some excellent references out there, like the Sears' Baby Book. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Too simplistic,"I found the book attempts to package all the answers into too simple solutions. It seems odd that the same author that writes ""What to Eat When You're Expecting"" which by the way is entirely too regimental, can also write all these books on child development. Many of the ideas seem half-baked, and made me question their authority. Some of the answers to questions seemed almost flippant, only drawing on personal opinion. I was especially mortified when I read the 3-month section on feeding, and how to get your baby to sleep through the night. I lost more sleep worrying about this than I would have waking up to feed baby. I think that this advice taken to heart would have really deprived and hurt my baby. Luckily I've learned enough on my own, and read enough other books, to recognize what I don't agree with."
1,"don't waste your money, buy Sears' Baby Book instead","This book focuses on the convenience of the parents. I bought my copy for one dollar at a garage sale, and it wasn't worth it. For example, it gives advice on how a parent can handle forcing a little baby to cry it out to sleep through the night. The advice? Use earplugs, white noise, unhook the baby monitor, etc., so YOU don't have to hear your baby scream in terror.Buy the Baby Book by Dr. William Sears instead. Dr. Sears had eight babies with his RN wife. He has excellent, practical advice that is compassionate towards babies."
1,Pretty Useless,"I read this when I was pregnant. I think its main purpose is to make the expectant mother paranoid. It's filled with the awful things that could happen--colic, strange birthmarks, etc. I kept getting the feeling that the advice was based on one child--the author's. This book doesn't help the new parent much."
1,Lots of Bad Information,"Unfortunately, the only good information in this book is the month-to-month milestones (and really, reading about milestones can drive you crazy, so why bother). This book does NOT truly advocate breastfeeding. This book does NOT advocate sleeping with your baby. This book does NOT advocate a truly kind, loving approach to parenting. This book offers ridiculous advice on nutrition including weaning from breastfeeding very early and hurrying up to introduce replacements such as cow's milk at 1 year of age, while along the way, ridding your house of ""all forms of sugar"". What a load.... If you are interested in shoving a bottle of formula in your baby's face, and sticking them in a crib until they throw up from crying, so that you can rush back to your ever-so-important job and manicures and pedicures, this book is for you!"
4,Laughed so hard milk came out my nose,I found this book to be hilarious. As I read I was surprized by how many of the definitions described things we do on a day to day basis but dont really think about. I shared this book with many of my friends and they all share my feelings. These books are great fun.
2,The extra on self esteem is barely worth it,"This 15 minute dvd uses as an example a high school jock jerk who wants a summer job to get a ""sweet ride to meet girls"" who actually says this to a potential employer. He writes his resume in red marker while letting his sandwhich spill on it, greets the potential employer with ""Dude"" which he comes to unannounced.You will learn next to nothing unless the person who needs a job is more dense then this guy or worse.There is a dvd entitled ""Dude, Where's my job"" which is the exact same thing from the same company, tmwmedia.There is an extra 30 min on self-esteem that is much better, more professional & feels right at home in a classroom. It's mostly all basics, but for anyone with self-esteem issues, it reminds you that when you're more confident, people around you are more relaxed as well & no company is going to hire you if your attitude is low or poor because it will reflect poorly on them.Try seeing if your local library has this first."

3,"Great Book, Slow Start","I think I've read this whole series, or at least the books I can get my hands on that is. The books are excellent, with well-developed characters and interesting story line. The author uses a system of magic I haven't seen anywhere else, the universe is based on group belief, if enough people believe something it's real... as people lose belief it dies... Well Far slayer's story is about 2 feuding families who hate each other so much; they forget what they hate each other for. Far Slayer enters their world and the two families start killing each other off... There is a Romeo And Juliet thing going here too... it starts slow, but ends well... I enjoyed it very much... just hang in through the beginning and you'll be glad you did."
2,Do your research,"We signed up with Vonage a couple of months ago. Setting up the D-Link adapter was a snap and I had a dial tone quickly. After several days, my line was ported and I thought everthing was ok.That was until I tried calling my dad several times and he just hung up on me. I heard his side clearly, but all he heard was static. Others complained about our connection too. Vonage support helped me change a few things on my account to take care of those problems.However, I still have not been able to use my computer modem to fax. I have tried multiple tips to get it to work, and still no luck. Calling Vonage's tech support is horrible. Long wait to talk with someone who doesn't speak good English nor has a clue about what to do with your problems.The worst part is that Vonage makes you sign up for a contract. If it wasn't for that, people would flee in droves. I think it will get better, but it has a way to go"
3,I'm Sorry. I thought this was America.,I also thought it was weird to tag Jeff Buckley on at the end.
2,The characters were not interesting.,"Most women flirt with and fall for Dante, a georgous man. Gia is a servant who plays hard to get with him because she has other things on her mind. He is drawn to her because she is a challenge. Eventually they get together, but the attraction is based on physical beauty rather than interesting character traits or other reasons for them to like each other. The theme of two good looking people meeting and getting together didn't do much for me. There is also a bad guy who wants Gia and wants to kill Dante.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: six. Setting: 1071 England. Copyright: 2006. Genre: historical romance.To date, I have read two Paula Quinn books. The other one is ""Lord of Desire"" copyright 2005. My 4 star review of that book was posted on 1/26/07."
3,not compatible with T-mobile SDA!,"It's not compatible with T-mobile. Music only played in 1 ear, and headset/button wasn't working!"
1,do NOT trust the picture this is a waste of money,"Product doesn't look like what is in the picture. It is shipped by Accessory one. but the headphone is defective. The microphone doesn't work, Nor does the send/end button. No one could hear me talking!! This is not a compatibility issue because my cell phone is also Samsung. It is just a fake product, money-wasting piece of junk."
3,Slam Dunk,"This is a good typing program. It was helpful to me for improving my speed. I learned to type on a program called PAWS, but i am unable to find it. If you know where i can find it, please post it or something. But, this is a great program if you are just learning to type."
2,Unsure?,"I bought these mats & for the past 2 weeks have loved them! So cute! Great designs...so easy to clean & flexible, but now the paint is flaking off and I see the product is made in China. Now I'm worried about what kind of toxic chemical is being released!"
5,Credo to human spirit's endurance,"Yerrid reels you right in, detail after vivid detail. You get inside his head and to the heart of the common thread in all his cases -- the nearly indominable strength of the human spirit. Not only is it fascinating how his clients' heart-wrenching stories came to be his legal cases in the first place, but the way he builds and executes his strategies lets you see firsthand the way a top gun lawyer thinks and maneuvers. There are poignant parts, whole sections that will compell you to read on faster and faster, and Yerrid's verbatim closing remarks are phenomenal -- expressive, emotionally charged... just brilliant.I'm not a lawyer and have never worked anywhere near the field. But what this is is an incredible opportunity for us as Americans to see the justice system at work for the people, written by someone who's clearly mastered it and is in it for the good guys."
1,bought the wrong product sent it back,thought i was buying a different dvd had to send it back and order the right one.don't make this hard or i won't do it
1,A Disappointment,"I have never been so disappointed in a book before. Not only is it not baby-cute like birth-baby books, it takes too many short-cuts on the information it does ask for. Also, it is not appropriate for many international adoptions in which no or little birth family information is known. There was nothing on the Amazon description page to let me know that this was not an international version -- I was expecting country-specific pages. I am returning it for a refund immediately."
3,Reasonably good biography.,"A fairly interesting account of Paul Martin's life, up to just before he became the Prime Minister of Canada. It reveals aspects of his character, such as his curiosity in always wanting to understand how everything works, and his overly cautious approach to managing the budget as the minister of finance under Jean Chretien. Also dealt with is the unfriendly relationship between Martin and Chretien, and how they managed to work mostly through intermediaries for their time together. A fair bit of the beginning of this book is spent discussing Paul Martin, Sr. and the 'Martin Women'. Perhaps a little more than necessary."
5,A Must Read for Any Pike Angler,"This is such an awesome book for ANY pike angler. The first few chapters explain locations and seasonal movements of pike, and the science behind the pike's environment including feeding habits, spawning, different lake types, etc. The ""Presentations for Pike on the Fly"" chapter is really where the fly-fishing aspect takes over (Ch 5). Many new recipies for pike flies, over 20 in total. The great thing about this book is that Barry explains how he uses each type of fly and when to use specific types of flies. If you haven't read his first book, ""Pike on the Fly,"" read that one first and then get this book. ""Mastering Pike on the Fly"" is a 10-year refinement of the tactics explained in ""Pike on the Fly."" Barry Reynolds knows his stuff well!!"
5,Best of the Best,"This is by far my favorite children's bible - for the slightly older child. It contains the whole arc of the old testament narrative, not just a few famous names, with the stories of the great prophets and of the women and of the kings woven in. The stories contextualize important historical information that might not be part of the bible story itself, but are familiar and helpful pieces of good study notations. The drawings are beautiful. The selections were just the right length for bedtime stories and held my son's attention night after night after night."
5,Inspirational!!,"Inspirational in the best sense of the word, in that it inspires young minds to think and use their imagination when relating to the 'classic' stories of Scripture. Told and re-told with no particular faith agenda/perspective in mind, these stories allow children to form their own opinions. In addition to the written word, the art work also challenges young minds to think as well as imagine possibilities that they had perhaps not considered prior to this telling of the stories."
2,Not Recommended,"Feels cheap, uses 2 hard-to-find batteries, and dust builds up inside of the display. Oh, and the door easily broke on mine."
2,Brilliant author has feet of clay after all,"If you have not ready Gregory Maguire's first two novels, by all means treat yourself to the joy that is ""Wicked"" and ""Confessions of a Wicked Stepsister."" If you have read them both and cannot get enough of this author, borrow a copy of ""Lost"". The saved purchase price will perhaps lessen the stinging disappointment that is ""Lost"". Twenty pages into this book I still had hope. Halfway through the book, I struggled against premature disappointment. Twenty pages to go and I am melancholy for the real Gregory Maguire."
2,Not in the same league with his other books,"As a commuter I have enjoyed Maguire's books on CD immensely (Wicked, Son of a Witch, What the Dickens)and expected the same from Lost. Was I wrong!! It isn't so much that the story is bad, but the woman (Jenny Sterlin) narrator/reader has a voice that is so sharp and grating that it was a literal assault on my ears. She made ALL of the characters sound mean, unsympathetic, ugly and sarcastic... even when their words weren't meant to be. It was impossible for me to warm up to any of the characters in this book. The readers of the other CDs (I felt) read the books perfectly, with just the right emphasis and style. I hope to never mistakingly buy a CD read by Jenny Sterlin again. I also hope that Maguire has the good sense to have a different reader for his other books, because I truly enjoy his other writing."
2,Don't judge by this read,"Fortunately, Wicked was my first Gregory Maguire reading experience and he quickly became a personal favorite with True Confessions and Mirror Mirror, and Son of a Witch more recently. Also fortunately, I hadn't started with Lost. Definitely my least favorite of his novels I felt like it lacked the description, creativity and strong storyline that I love about his other books. For those of you who were unfortunate enough to choose this as your first Gregory Maguire read, please try again with any of his his others and you will not be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I have read several titles by Gregory Maguire, I loved ""Wicked"" and thought other titles of his were also decent. ""Lost"" starts out good, but somewhere in the middle it became difficult to read, and I had to force myself to complete the book. It is almost as if Gregory Maguire got lost himself while writing the book. I highly recommend skipping this title and checking out one of Gregory MaGuires other books."
3,Full of twists and turns,"Gregory Maguire's ""Lost,"" although a quick read, will keep your interest, as the plot features twists and turns to make your head spin. Do not expect all the threads to be neatly tied up at the end: They aren't. This is an unusual novel: Part mystery, part ghost story, part historical fiction, with a dose of journey-to-self-discovery on the part of Winnie, the main character.As you are reading along, you will find the mundane suddenly jarred up against the truly bizarre. Expect the unexpected, go with the flow, and you will be rewarded with a diverting read.""Lost"" is just the thing for a chilly night in late October, as the full moon shines and the leaves swirl."
1,Lost,"I loved Wicked. But I was completely and utterly lost with this book. There were so many loose ends and no reason why certain things were even introduced. I've read ""a christmas carol"" many times. Since this was included in the book, to read first, I thought there must be some sort of twist or direct connection to the book. Red Herring. I read all the way to the end because I just knew there was some reason to do so. There wasn't. I haven't been this let down by a favored author in a very long time. I think there were a lot of directions this book could have gone to tie together things that were introduced. As a matter of fact, there were some great ideas that could be the beginning of many different stories. This was just a waste of my time."
2,A Dissapointment,"Gregory Maguire previous novels were amazing reads, so naturally i was excited to read his newest novel. His main character Winnie is one of the most unlikable characters that i've ever read, and not because I was supposed to. The reader is supposed to start off not liking her, but in the end she's somehow redeemed...but she isn't. The characters in ""Lost"" are disjointed and not fully developed (much like the preceeding paragraph).The plot of the book was never fully developed either, and the end was abrubt and unsatisfying. If you've never read any of Maguire other novels, stop right here and pick up one of his other books. This novel does not do him justice, infact its hard to believe its even written by the same author as ""Wicked"" or ""Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister""."
1,Very bad read,This was perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. The story was confusing and lacked focus. I would not suggest this book to anyone.
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and I just finished it lately. This is my first and probably last Gregory Maguire book. Since you have already read the above reviews and know the basic plot information I will skip that and give my thoughts on the book. This book is supposedly a ghost story. It did nothing to frighten you or give you that ""creepy"" feeling a good ghost story does. I did not empathize with the heroine. In fact, I found her annoying and not at all sympathetic. In a good thriller you should feel that the hero is in some sort of imminent terrible danger sometime during the story. I never felt that the heroine was in danger. And finally, the ending was just too convenient, like a made for TV movie."
2,not maguire's best work,"it seems mr. maguire has hit a creative rut, having found a formula and now simply repeating the process for each new novel. oh, well... stick with ""wicked"" or ""confessions of an ugly step sister."""
1,Lost story line,"What's lost here is the story line! This book is so different from Maguire's other 3 books, it is as though someone else wrote it. Is this what happens when a publisher urges a quick sequel to best-sellers?"
1,DON'T.....,"Don't buy, borrow or steal this book. It is beyond mind-numbing. It is barren of thought, colorless bordering on gray/black, bland to the taste of mildew, banal, pointless, tedious.....yada, yada, yada. This man sits with a thesaurus writing words to compose his witless story. A tractor couldn't plow through the boring mess. There are so many thrilling books on the supernatural - bypass this or fall into a chasm of writing despair."
1,worst book ever by maguire,"My first experience with the writer was Wicked...holy moly was it good. Then we read 'Confessions'...super holy moly, really good. Lastly we read Lost. WTF!?!? Bad, Bad, Bad. I am thankful i didnt pick this one up first. The book makes no sense. It seems to me there is a shortage in mushrooms, because Greggy seems to have eaten them all up."
1,I now wish it had been Lost in the mail.,"The books of Maguire were touted as ""reimagining of classic fairy tales."" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."
2,Worst Maguire Book by Far,"Maguire's obfuscatory writing style and disconnected plots actually worked pretty well in his three other books, based on well-known stories. Without the underpinning of those plot lines, though, his writing is too haphazard to make much sense. It doesn't help that his main character is almost a blank slate. There is so much unsaid throughout the book, and events seem to mean nothing and go nowhere. Worst of all, the mysteries don't entice the reader; they're just annoying and boring. I enjoyed the other three books, but this one is work to get through. Stick to the other three and avoid this one."
3,just ok,"I just love Gregory Maguire. That being said, I wasn't to impressed by Lost. I felt that it left out to many details about Winnie. By the time you figured out what was going on something else happened. Also the other characters just came and went with out any explanation. I also am curious as to why the chapters were so long."
1,"I feel like I ""Lost"" hours of my life that I wish I could have back","This book was a disappointment... the plot was confusing, the characters not well developed. As another reviewer said, I feel like I needed a map to understand what was going on in this book."
1,Bah!,"Or should I say, BLAH.BLAH BLAH.BLAH BLAH BLAH.What a humbuggery of artifice, written with great pretence, and with a preoccupation to find an opportunity to use vulgarisms wherever it can be attempted for a little wake-up ""shock"" to the reader who managed to get to that word. Without spelling the latter out explicitly, I refer to cat ****, and being ****ed back as hard as ... was ****ed [asterisks and ellipses substituted to preserve the suspense]. wow. Those are examples of the most unpalatable and irredeemable moments.I am certainly no prude, and no literary professor, but I would not recommend wasting time or money on this book. I only hope I haven't wasted more of each by purchasing WICKED before reading this piece of... work.Great Aspirations of Winifred Rudge or the Mystery of Ozias Drood?Blah... I mean ""Bah!"""
2,Not What I Expected,"I have LOVED Maguire's books so far - the Wicked series was excellent, as were Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Mirror Mirror. I purchased ""Lost"" with the excitement of a new favorite book to add to my list.I was SORELY disappointed.I actually enjoyed the book up until the last few chapters. The story kept moving, and carried me right with it. I was excited to finish the book... Now I almost wish I hadn't. The story feels like Maguire just got bored with it, and finished it because he didn't want to work on it anymore. The ending is horrible and leaves you hanging, unsure of what just happened.Aside from that, the characters are undeveloped, the side stories are almost too many to keep track of, and you finish the book hating the main character and wishing she'd just get on with it.If you like be unsatisfied with your books, this is definitely one for you."
3,A decent novel,"This was my third book by Gregory Maguire to read (after completing Wicked and Son of a Witch).Lost presents an interesting story:It starts off with a car wreck in America which the main charecter, Winnie, is delayed in getting to a meeting of Forever Families. From here Winnie travels to London to do research for her new novel about Jack the Ripper's ghost.Upon arriving in London, Winnie discovers that her cousin John is missing...This novel becomes involved and grasps the reader's intrest early on, however, after arriving at the end of this 300+ page novel one feels a little empty handed...As with many of Maguire's novels i find that after accomplishing reading the work too few of the plot lines are brought to an end."
3,cheap? yes - but it works,"works fine for my new vehicle, as i wanted something to protect the cloth seat from salt and sand...the thru-straps at the seat/back juncture are too short, so i simply buckled a spare hiking strap around the seatafter two months of use, the cover has not torn...i wish it were just a bit bigger, but the stretch feature saved the dayif the seat cover lasts a year, it's still worth it (good covers cost 10X as much, and aren't cost-effective)"
1,a loud coaster maker,"This drive is extremely loud, especially when accessing files, but even when playing back music--very irritating if your listening to a quiet classical music passage.This drive also takes a long time to access data, during which time it locks up my computer.I've also had a lot of issues with the bundled EZCD Creator software--many cases where the software would misread blank CDRs as full, preventing me from using them.I just purchased the Plextor plexwriter 24/10/40A CDRW from Amazon (for another computer), and I'm much happier. I find the plexwriter to be smooth, quiet, very fast, and reliable."
2,I dont Bel;ieve it,2 weeks after I wrote this Review I no longer can not copy and birce CD's......It's like clock work.It was good till it lasted...
2,Worked great...until the warranty expired.,"I got mine For Christmas 2000, and it worked great on my 466mhz celeron with 256mb RAM (I had to upgrade from 64mb so I could write at a speed higher than 8x). It was very noisy but I just figured that was how high speed CD-RW drives worked. Well after having it for just over a year, the drive failed to read/write discs. I thought my drive was just a fluke until I came here and saw many other people who have had the same problem. I'd only recommend this drive if you upgrade your system every year or so, because maybe you'll upgrade before this drive fails on you. Otherwise don't buy it."
2,Don't buy It if it's built before nov 2000,you dont want one that is built before nov 200 with the old firmware. I got 3 of them for systems I built and had to return 2 that where the older ones. You cant flash the drives they lock up..
1,UPS getting wealthy,"I am in process of returning my second sample of this unit. This is not my first burner, and my system and software are up to date. The first couldn't read an Imation disc it had just burned at only 4x (crashed with Easy CD Creator Deluxe 4.02e1 but I could use DirectCD 4.02d), and an hour with Yamaha tech resulted in a return. The replacement is completely dead- no power- after a 1.0H firmware upgrade attempt that failed while installing. Both sounded like string trimmers. I am going to try a Plextor- I can't stand to keep paying for continual trips to UPS. They're the only ones in this deal that are making out."
1,Disappointment has a new name and they call it CRW2100EZ,"I had really high expectations for this drive, which may have led to the high dissapointment when it didn't meet those expectations. I had a model made in DEC 2000 with the latest firmware version. I couldn't get it to burn CD's consistently. I tried Disk to Disk, Disk to Drive to Disk, with DMA, without DMA, as a slave, as a master, on it's own IDE channel. I even installed it in two different PC's. PIII 500mhz with 256MB RAM and PIII 700mhz with 256MB RAM. The drive would consistently lock up the PC and put out coaster after coaster.I have never used Yamaha drives before. They have a really good reputation and I may try them again at some point, but the bottom line with this product is that it is their flagship drive ( excepting the SSCI version )Needles to say this one is on it's way back."
5,Very good and reliable.,Since I bought it works fine. I'm satisfied. Is not noisey and fast. I could burn my CD's for 4 minutes.
4,Easy setup and works great!,"I was cautious in purchasing this drive. I have read some bad reviews with problems this drive had with making coasters. Reading more details about the bad reviews, a lot of the coaster problems related to slow hard drive's or slow CD-Rom drives as the master drive. I have a very slow CD-Rom drive, its only 4x, so all the copies I have made, I have transfered the data to the hard drive then to a CD-R. With this drive being a 40x read this doesnt take much time at all. I have successfully copied music CD's as well. I have been using this drive for two weeks now and love it. If you have a fairly fast computer with a good hard drive as well as a CD Rom drive that is as fast read speed or faster than this CD-R This may be a good choice for you. My system specs are.. My next purchase for my computer is going to be a faster CD-Rom Drive!Custom home built PCAMD K6-2 500Fujitsu 5400rpm 6gig hard drive288MB SD-100 Ram4x CD RomYamaha CRW2100EZ CD-R/RW Drive"
2,Noisy!!,"...I thought I was buying one of the best burner available in the market. Well, I was wrong. That burner was noisy whenever it was ready a CD and had some problems reading it. However, it was very quiet when I was burning CD-Rs and CD-RWs. I guess my friend was right when he told me to get a Plextor ... got one now and they are surely the best on the market!!"
1,It doesn't work,"You may have better luck than I did, but I tried for several days and I couldn't get it to work. Tech support was prompt and very nice, but they couldn't get it to work either. I have twin 733 P3 Coppermines, 2 ata 100 channels, a 7200 rpm hard drive with a seek time well within their parameters, and 512 mb of ram so I wouldn't expect that the problem would be on my end. The Roxio website states that there are ""known issues"" with this drive. Good Luck. Sometimes things are [inexpensive] for a reason."
2,This is the worst Oracle admin book around,This book and CD package is next to worthless. Lynnewood Brown teaches Oracle as if he were talking to kindergarten children. The contents of the CD are read almost verbatim from the book. The book totally turned me off from the rest of the books in the series.
2,Cutting Horse,"Beautiful scenery, Beautiful horses, however acting was very poor. It was all around acting at it's worst."
2,"Enough, already","The premise of this book can be summed up thusly. ""This is David Cone and he grew up with lots of friends in Kansas City...and he's a better pitcher than what his 2000 numbers show...he is...really...he is...just watch him...he can still pitch...I swear...seriously, he can!"" We get the picture, Roger. Cone has repeatedly said that he does not want to be remembered by that 2000 season, but curiously enough, this book is built on it. He certainly deserves his place in history as a great clutch pitcher and team leader, but this book comes off as pleading and almost desperate. Cone ought to find better ways of dealing with his feelings and Roger Angell should have known better."
3,Just An Average Book: Not a Compelling Read,"Great authour, great pitcher, poor book.I am a great ball fan and a regular at the Blue Jays games - especially when the Yankees or the A's or Seattle come to town. Cone was here when we (my team the Jays - I do not own the Jays, everyone here calls them his team) won the world series in 92 and we all loved him.I was excited when the book arrived from Amazon.com, but very disappointed when I actually read the book. I never finished it. I thought it was slow and a bit light. The author cannot keep your attention and the book wanders. Waste of money only two or three stars. Sorry but that is my humble opinion. Read DiMaggios's book ""The Hero's Life"" for a good biography about life on and off the field."
3,"Its good, just boring to read","Not a bad product, but definitely a lot more boring to read than a lot of art business books I have read through. It also repeats itself a lot. But it's ok."
3,"Strong on Inspiration, Weak on Implementation","I agree with another reviewer who in essence said this book paints a great picture of the value of volunteerism, but gives little instruction on how to recruit. Just about everyone who takes the time to read this title will admit that volunteer ministry is a very good thing and should be greatly applauded. The problem however, is that those of us who are leaders would appreciate Hybels doing more than just ""preaching to the choir."" The people needing to hear the message of this book are the very ones who won't be reading it.I respect Hybels and have benefited enormously from his other writings. This title unfortunately, doesn't fit his previous high standards. While enjoyable and easy to read, this book provides little help to a frustrated leader with few volunteers."
4,Encouragement Through Anecdotals!,"This combination is great. Not another abstract book with principles of how to do ministry. Rather, Bill Hybels shares stories from the ministry of how ordinary Christians were transformed into true servants of Christ, in their volunteer capacities.Thank you, Bill. I highly recommend this book to those in ministry."
3,under a war torn sky,This book takes place durring World War two. This book is about a young fighter war pilot that is the best plane flier that anyone has seen. While he is flying he gets shot down. He runs for his life. He trys to get into a program that lets him try to escape. I think one of the best parts is when he is trying to climb over the mountain and gets gaught by the gestapo. They try to torture him to get information. He doesn't give any information. He ends up escaping. Read this book yourself to find out if he gets home over the long terrifying road to his freedom!
5,Excellent Book for Kids and Adults,"I purchased the book with my sons in mind but as I started reading it with them I became enthralled. This book is an excellent read for all ages. It gives our children an understanding of the tremendous hardship and sacrifices our parents and grandparents made for America. The story is fast paced, the characters are very compelling - I was hooked from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book for all."
5,Great book!,Do you need a book report book? This book is the perfect war story for you! This book is about a boy named Henry who gets shot down and lands in France. It's a story how he goes through the underground trying to get back home. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a book report book.
2,"Unimpressive, uninspiring (an early opinion)","It's horrible for me to say this, having been a devoted and vocal supporter of Gaelic Storm since 19th December 1997, but this new album is a major disappointment. ""Tree"" lacks the soul and spunk of ""Gaelic Storm"" and ""Herding Cats"", two albums I loved from the first listen. It's not a bad album, but it's far from the best Gaelic Storm cd."
2,Just a series of multiple choice tests,"I found this book pretty useless. All it is is a series of 16 multiple choice tests in which you choose the answer that most closely approximates the word given. Sample question: amorphous means a) shapeless b) passionate c) property transfer d) vase-like e) parallel. Each test is preceded by very short definitions of the words plus each one used in a context sentence. It would be okay, I guess, as a superficial refresher, but I didn't find it challenging, and there was no discussion of strategy for the GMAT verbal/vocab section, which is more what I was hoping for."
5,Well worth every penny,"This book was amazing!It is very simple and very straight-forward with the sole purpose of helping your improve your vocabulary...and it works. I got through the book in 8 days, completing two chapters a day. It took me approximately two or three hours of work per day to work with this book. It gives you the tools to really understand a word and remember it. Don't try to save time by not looking up the words and not finding antonyms and synonyms for the words. It will not work. You have to get down to the nitty-gritty and then you will see results. Words that would not stick, I wrote down on flashcards and reviewed them along with the 300 word list from Barron's Passkey to the GRE book.Say the words out loud, repeatedly do the exercises at the end of each chapter and it will pay off on the GRE exam. I promise! By the way, it is a one-time use book....you will scribble on every page and no one else will be able to use it, but that is what it is....a work book. Buy it!"
3,Great music - annoying sound effects,"This CD starts off so well (tracks 1 - 6). The music is smooth and well-put together with a blend of Native American voices, flutes and modern intrumentation. Deterioration is a good word to use when it comes to the last half of the album. Tracks 7, 8 and 9 are nothing but noise - no music at all. I haven't even entirely made it through them because they are irritating at best. The last track, #10 is great (except for a few sound effects). Again, it's music and it's good.Listening to the first part of this album I get the impression that Blue Chip Orchestra is talented and capable of putting out some great music. Why the noise? I have to wonder. Did they run out of musical ideas? I have been waiting for a (improved )second album but so far there isn't one. Too bad. Blue Chip Orchestra has so much potential."
3,don't get too excited,"I agree with some other reviews. I love the idea and image of this book, but it's all too short. This book should have been 1000 pages. The NT chapter is only about 30 pages, mostly which only defines the attacks. I could have written a 30-page essay for my highschool about NT attacks before i read this book.Buy it, it's a nice addition to the library."
3,You have to be a programmer to understand this book,"Good, but difficult to follow unless you are a programmer. But I didn't learn a great deal from it and enjoyed the challenge."
4,Terrific Writing,These short stories are searing -- they get right at the heart of marginalized individuals. This is one of the better short story collections I have read in recent years.
1,LAKEITRA BEARD,I LIKE TO MEET MARY-KEAT AND ASLHEY.WE CAN GO SHOPPING AT THE MALL BUT I STAY IN GROVETOWN GA IN APARTMENTS.
1,What a piece of junk!,"This is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever purchased! the hooks and balls on the ends are made of very flimsy plastic, NOT METAL! The 2 main center pieces don't fit together correctly and it wobbles all over the place. You might as well just through the coats on the floor!"
1,Not as it appears!!!,"This product is not nearly as good as it looked. It comes in a million pieces, which is fine. The dissapointing factors are that the chrome finish is only on part of the rack. The knobs at the end of each arm is very cheap plastic. Half of them broke while trying to put it together. It is very flimsy and cheap looking."
2,"not quite a rip-off, a let-down, none the less","I was kinda disappointed in this dvd. I had previously read an online review about how the Steve Francis section was great, but honestly, it was nothing to write home about. All the dunks he had were pretty average; he's had many more explosive dunks in NBA games. The other 'reputed'dunkers weren't 2 cents worth my time either. The only brief spark I saw on this otherwise uninspiring dvd was the section of James White; dude's pretty talented but not even he could rescue this video from the fraudulent ""entertaining"" claims it made. If you badly want to see the 2- minute snippet of James White's acrobatic forays to the hoop, then maybe this dvd is worth purchasing. Other than that, bah humbug."
4,classic,"Johan Van Der Keuken: Complete Collection, Volume 2 (3pc) Classic documentaries I would recommend to anyone serious about watching or making docs"
2,For scholars only,"This book has only a few pages of material which will be new to Epicureans who already have the extant works of Epicurus and Lucretius (See Gaskin's ""Epicurean Philosophers""). Unless you are a scholar, there is precious little here to justify your spending money to acquire this book unless cost is not a problem for you. I borrowed it from a University and was finished reading it in one afternoon. It does contain half a dozen maxims which MAY be by Epicurus, however. For the scholar, yes. For the general student of Epicurus, no."
5,No coat closet? Buy this.,"This is a good product at a great price. Previously, we owned a wooden coat tree which wore out quickly, was heavy and easily tipped over by our small children. This coat tree, while a bit shorter than our first one, is lightweight, sturdy and stable. I also like the fact that it has mutiple places to hang things. The umbrella stand at the bottom is great for putting the kid's shoes in as well."
3,Get what you pay for,"This would be much better if it had 4 legs instead of 3. I've had it topple over on me while walking past and brushing a coat hanging on it, or trying to hang an additional one on it. It's very top heavy when there are more than 2 coats hanging on it. Considering it has hooks for more than 6 coats, that's a big pile on the ground when it tips over."
4,A Comprehendable Guide to Fantasy/Sci-Fi Writing,"Most Sourcebooks I've seen are simply lists of information with tiny descriptions after each item. This book not only has that, but it also includes many articles by known authors on some of the critical details of selling manuscripts. I definently recommend this to anyone who'd like a taste of how to get your work published."
4,Very entertaining !,Great video of the NBA guards who were entertaining to watch. They were spectacular indeed !
3,Buy vol. 3 first.,"Jock Jams Vol. 4 is a valiant effort to parallel ESPN's third volume. However, I found vol. 4 to be forced, especially the mega mixes. ESPN should have waited for artists to release more fitting songs before releasing this monument to testosterone. Rather, they grafted one song to another with no regard to how the music flowed. If you are looking to buy an energy pumping CD, check out Jock Jams Vol. 3."
2,Formula has changed for the worse,"I used to love this conditioner but the formula has changed. It no longer works as well. It also has a few added chemicals I can't pronounce. For a product that used to be simple and natural enough to work well for sensitive types, this is very disappointing. I have had to switch conditioners due to the irritants added to the new formula. Too bad, becaues this stuff used to be great."
2,Not for me,I found this product to do nothing as far as getting ride of snarls and tangles. I may be bias because im transitioning from none organic hair care but it really didn't do anything. I put it in my hair and I didn't feel a difference in the texture like I do with other products. It really doesn't smell that great either when in your hair.
4,very disappointed that it was abridged,"I really like this story, and the audio was well done, but obviously I wasn't paying attention. I thought that when it came out on MP3 it was unabridged. I almost always hate abridgements. There are a very few books I'd like to hear abridged, but very, very few."
1,Please!,"There was more unneeded detail in this book than I have seen in a long time. The author, whom I have read frequently, was so wrapped up in showing a painful amount of knowledge on bronze that she lost the thread of the story. In addition, did anyone ever explain to her that a person could look totally hooked on a man without literally falling all over him in public? I guess not. I could have put up with that, but when I finally got to the last page, I didn't even bother to pass the book to a friend. Not wanting to have by head bashed by the book, I simply threw it away.What a waste."
3,Missing Game pieces.,"Unsatisfied. I received the product timely. Unfortunately, I did not open product to check if it was complete. Purchased new, never thought it would be incomplete. I did not receive the letter cards needed to play the game; I will now need to make some cards of my own. Always check items even if you do not intend to use right away. ince I have not played the game itself yet, I cannot say whethe it is fun. Looks very interesting though."
1,Play another game,"With eight people playing, this got to crazy (and not fun). The set up is too hard to follow, it is very difficult to teach a group who has never played, and it gets boring quickly. There rules are not clear (if the letter is I can you say ink well then ink pen and ink stain, etc, etc etc). The game is too subjective. People who had longer words to say (like actors and cities) never could be included. It is a poor game."
4,Very timely--wonderful collection!,"I think that they made a very good compilation of Silk. It's unfortunate that they left Elektra Records and decided to go on an independent label. This group knew how to sing it on the most sexy of songs. Freak Me went to No. 1, but I thought that the group had better songs than that, which are on this album. I especially like the bass-heavy Happy Days, Don't Rush, the hits from ""Tonight""--Meeting In My Bedroom, Let's Make Love, If U, and We're Calling You. I especially like I Can Go Deep which was on the Low Down Dirty Shame soundtrack from '94 but they put it on their '95 album. The song's originally over 6 minutes (was on the single), but they cut it to 4:47 for both albums.That song is so smooth with its calm basslines and romantic, lush landscape. I think that Silk had some memorable hits and got better at their craft as a vocal group. Very timely for them to release this album!"
4,It's really a 3.75,"I remember back in '99 when 'Meeting In My Bedroom' came out. I loved the song but didn't know who sang it. Flash forward 5 years and I find it's Silk and I decide to get this cd. I was too young (born in 1987) to remember Silk's first two albums but they had some strong material. 'Freak Me', 'Lose Control' 'Hooked On You', and 'Happy Days', which samples James Brown's 'The Payback' are great songs. This had me thinkin' Silk was totally underrated. Then I heard 'If You (Lovin' Me)' and 'Girl U For Me' which were alright,not too good not too bad, just alright. Then came the crap of 'We're Callin' You' and the last 3 songs which are skipable. So all n all it's worth getting, just stop at track 10."
3,Ice Crusher Looks Good,"We purchased this ice crusher on Amazon because we couldn't get it in the Target store. If I had seen it in the store and had a chance to see it operate, I wouldn't have purchased it. The crusher is heavy cast iron and steel and has sharp blades, it's just not heavy enough to keep it from sliding across the counter when trying to operating it. If you put a lot of weigh on the top to keep it from sliding, it'll flip over. By the time you've fought it all over the bar and kitchen, all the ice has melted in the catch cup.If you're looking for fast, easy crushed ice for bar drinks, invest the cash on a good commercial type electric unit and use the Metrokane for an art-deco piece in the bar corner."
4,Metrokane Ice-O-Mat Ice Crusher,"Nice looking unit! Works well, although with hard ice the handle can be difficult to turn. The crushed ice tends to freeze in the stainless steel cup. Like the art deco design."
5,Excellent Monitor,"We got this monitor about one month ago. We also bought a DVI enabled video card so we could take advantage of the digital inputs it has. You can also use an analog connection but we thought we got a better picture with the digital inputs. It has a very high resolution so the words were a bit small for our aging eyes, but we were able to adjust many settings thru Windows XP and got all the words, etc., very readable. You do need to load some drivers which they provide for best results. Very easy from the supplied CD. They provide a Magic Tune program which is supposed to help you adjust settings but we could not get it to work even after going to Samsung's site and downloading a newer version. But you can adjust things manually so it was not a big problem. Definately an excellent monitor but you can get it cheaper than Amazon if you look a little."
5,Good service,"I liked this company. I ordered the wrong product and they didn't fight about taking it back. The product was good and delivered timely and at a good price, just not what I needed."
2,"The Silver Chair is a ok, boring, funny book!!!","This reader thinks The Silver Chair is an OK book, but the language was so confusing! It had a funny part in it when the owl thought that Eustace's name was ""Useless."" I wouldn't recommend this book because it had difficult old English vocabulary."
5,THe Lost Prince,When Eustace and Jill are magicly sent to Narnia and told by Aslan to find the king's lost son they must embark on a journey to find the missing prince. Luckily they are assisted by a swampy creature named Puddlegum who knows a lot about the land of Narnia. They adventure into the caves of the underworld where they find thelost prince and a witch who plans to invade the overworld. Will they defeat the witch in time and escape with the prince? Read to find out.
5,Characters you grow to like,"C.S. Lewis probably has no equal in the creation of allegorical fantasy. The best of the best, in my opinion, is ""The Silver Chair"". It is a great story in and of itself- adventure, witches, enchantment, battles and talking animals- plus it has the additional trait of being a primer for the early Christian walk and a lesson on our encounters with God. Finally, and probably my favorite aspect of the book, is the character ""Puddleglum"". Puddleglum is a rare literary character who develops a sense of humor as well as a moral character. A lot of writers can tell great stories, but few can develop great characters you wish you could know, and Lewis does that here as well as anyone- especially over so few pages."
3,The Silver Chair,"This book is about a boy named Eustace and a girl named Jill running away from bullies and ending up in the other world.Aslan the Lion has a task for the kids. They have to defeat the evil White witch to save Prince Rilan from her castle. To do that, they have to go on a long journey to find the White witch's castle.They go on great adventures together meeting new people and making friends with nymphs.I like this book because it was filled with adventures and filled with abnormal creatures. This book keeps you full of exciting imaginations through the journies Eustace and Jill took.My favorite part of the book was when The Whire witch was defeated and the Prince was freed. Tah is my favorite part of the story because there is action and after she was defeated, Prince Rilan got to go back to Cair Paravel(his home) to meet his father. The story was a happy ending for everyone."
2,The People I've Slept With,"this movie more about sexThe People I've Slept With2009NR89 minutesWhen Angela Yang (Karin Anna Cheung) finds out she's pregnant, she's got countless reasons to be upset about it. But, more specifically, she's concerned because she's slept with so many different guys that she has no idea who the father is. Her more conservative sister (Lynn Chen) makes finding the baby's daddy -- and marrying him -- sound like the only plausible option. But Angela's liberally minded best friend (Wilson Cruz) has other ideas.Cast:Chris Zylka, Wilson Cruz, Archie Kao, Karin Anna Cheung, Cathy Shim, Lynn Chen, James Shigeta, Randall Park, Stacie Rippy, Tim Chiou, Rane Jameson, Elizabeth Sung Director:Quentin Lee Genres:Comedies, Independent Movies, Romantic Movies, Romantic Comedies, Independent Comedies, Romantic Independent Movies This movie is:Raunchy, Romanticmy page for reviews [...]"
3,"Not The Best I've Slept With, But Not The Worst Either","The People I've Slept With is a pleasant little dramady, no more no less. There is nothing great, or very funny about it. But it didn't put me to sleep. That's something, right? And the actor who played the ""hottie"" was really hot!"
5,excellent service and excellent coffee,This is the best deal around for K cup coffee. Not to be missed if you have a Keiring coffee maker
5,coffee k-cup Green Mountain,I am so glad that I read other peoples positive reviews on this coffee. I love it and so does my family. I always loved green mountain brand for my regular coffee maker and love it for my kuerig. We drink a lot of coffee and will be ordering more of this again soon....
1,If you loved the series and Ultimate volumes 1-4 then don't waste your money on this POS,"Poor animation, poor quality, poor menu. Remember the main character? You won't see much of him in these shows. Remember the good music? Forget for these four. Remember a good story? This is just blood and bombs. Making fun of the Catholic Church, the Church of England, and the the British while glorying the nazis.After waiting for three years this was a real disappointing."
5,Hellsing Ultimate,Great four episodes! Funimation needs to step up and bring out the rest of this series! I've waiting over 5 years for this and I can't bare to wait another 5 for a few more episodes
5,"Addy, American Civil War History","If you have a young daughter and are interested in teaching about the American Civil War through the eyes of a former slave, this book is for you!"
1,Worst book in the series,There was too much time spent in the book on slavery and not enough time spent on life during the Civil War.
4,A good collection of pop-rock songs,"I stumbled across Matt Woods' WEB site while searching around for music. I checked out the samples for the album and really liked what I heard. I ordered the album and am really happy with it. I hope to hear more from Matt someday. Check out the song samples at: http://www.mattwoodsband.comHere is a track listing:1. Bottled Up Inside (3:09)2. Misconception (3:40)3. Lyndall (3:17)4. Offering (3:44)5. Never Not Too Late (4:46)6. Won't Forget (4:18)7. Blow Away (3:40)8. Hiding (4:48)9. Gone (3:45)10.

(post 1990) or The Clarks, this is probably right up your alley."
1,"Item Damaged, Customer Disappointed","This item was damaged when it arrived. The hubcap which holds the wheel in place was broken and therefore the item did not function properly. I purchased this item for work and I did not have time to return it and wait for a new one. Instead I had no choice but to super-glue the hubcap to the thread that holds it in place. Considering the cost of this item, I would expect it to be packaged and/or shipped more carefully. I am extremely disappointed."
3,Does the job,"If you're outputting to a standard definition TV made before 2001 this will do just fine, but if you're outputting to anything made in the last 10 years look for a different product. It can't handle gradients and suffers from noticeable banding.On the other hand it is very simple to setup & use, just don't expect very good quality picture."
1,Interferencia en el monitor,"Este producto provoca una imagen borrosa en el monitor en donde se instala, entonces, uno no puede dejar el QuickPlay permanentemente conectado en la computadora.Ya lo revise con 2 monitores, uno compaq de 17"" 7500 y un ViewSonic de 19"" con los mismos resultados. (No lo he revisado con PCs Portatiles)Es algo incomodo el estar conectando y desconectando los cables de video VGA del monitor, ya que siempre se tiene la preocupación de doblar los alambres del conector.Definitivamente este detalle deja de hacer practico el producto, por lo demás, creo que se calienta demasiado y el hecho de tener una paleta de colores de 16bits y no de 24bits (Por lo menos) realmente produce imagenes horribles para las plículas DVD que en realidad es el proposito principal de este equipo.En resumen, creo que es un producto con calidad muy inferior para lo que promete (Ver Películas desde tu PC), Te recomiendo que no pierdas tu dinero y tu tiempo con el y mejor revises otros productos."
4,Tigers cant get any cuter,"This is very cute and a good size toy.Very soft and adorable. This is going to be designated ""leader"" of all the plush toys for our baby."
3,not great,This is a mediocre english to spanish translator (I have about a 40% success rate when looking up spanish words...) that suffers greatly from a very poor keyboard; I have to press keys several times to get them entered on each word. Too bad...
5,"I got bodies on the left, I got bodies on the right...","I got bodies up and down, all across town, slay your soul tonight! The ultimate Danzig album. Every song simply rocks! (Except maybe dirty black summer..)But I've listened to this disc for years and nothing these days comes close. Buy it, toss it in, start drinkin, and rock."
5,Great Mattress Pad,"I was originally considering a waterproof anti-dust mite pad, but decided that I wanted something more breathable, affordable, soft, and without the extra costs associated with a high quality pad. The Protech Fortrel has delivered upon all of my expectations. It breathes well, it's durable and holds up in the wash, and 39.99 is a reasonable price to pay. While I haven't gotten a microscope to check for mites, I'm sleeping through the night and don't wake up feeling like the bed bugs have bitten.I call that a win."
1,"Noisy, noisy, noisy","This is made of some crinkly material that makes a lot of noise on the bed. We put it on, and immediately took it off again and sent it back. I can't comment on its effectivness, but please be aware of the noise issue before you buy it."
5,Cute Siamese Kitten,"I have a Siamese kitten, and ""she"" purchased 3 of these for my best friend's little granddaughters for Christmas. They loved them. They are soft plush, well made, and a good likeness of my cat. Excellent price and free shipping made them a very good deal."
5,This show is a gem~,"I confess to being a diehard Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman fan, but this is such a great DVD. Both of these guys look wonderful - and the music is nostalgic and new at the same time. Their comraderie and genuine fondness for each other makes this performance even more special - thank the music gods for keeping these two incredible talents working together after all this time. We are so lucky to be here for it."
2,Let's remember our idols as they WERE.,"Lotsa of Guess Who / BTO songs missing in action. Twentysome albums between these guys and they're padding the concert with some dull covers and some unispired new material. (""Let It Ride"" is dull and all the life has been sucked out of ""American Woman"". Sad.)Worst of all...Cummings voice is shot."
2,Not really a very good book,"I am a beginner in Visual Basic .NET, and I am not really a big fan of this book...This book definetely conveys the ideas however this book does not give u an opportunity to practice and get better. There is barely any extra exercise which will expose you to the programming skill....Overall ok..."
1,No Mixing Instructions,There is not one word on the bottle about how to mix this concentrate. It does indicate that it will treat up to 5000sq ft. It can be used on fruits and vegetables. However is is difficult to measure the square footage of leaves in my garden. My fruit trees are an even bigger challange to measure the square footage of leaves. There is a telephone number listed on the bottle. but be sure to have plenty of time to wait for an answwer... I gave up after a 20 minute hold time!
1,"Had two, both broke",I do not recommend this item. I've had two so far and both belt clips have fallen apart. The leather around the belt clip quickly tears which results in the belt clip falling out of the case.
2,Very frustrating to use.,"I bought this item to help me wring every last bit of accuracy and reliability out of my reloads. It worked well about half of the time. The main problem that quickly reared it's head is that the cutting surface is actually a removable drill bit. That sounds good in theory, but it is only held in place by friction. Since it is used to cut METAL, the bit OFTEN gets dug in to the metal that it is supposed to be cutting, and simply spins in its handle, rather than actually cutting anything. Many times i've actually had the bit stick inside the case i'm trying to cut, and i remove an empty handle. Mine is now so loose in it's handle that it simply won't cut at all anymore. It is now useless. I'm going to try brazing the bit in place, which is what should have been done in the factory where it was made.As it is, I really wouldn't recommend this item."
5,Safe and Sound.,"Good not having to worry about cards being crushed or gotten wet. I kept this case under water for 15 minutes with no moisture getting in. Plus, with this color it will also be very hard to leave laying around somewhere. Nice touch that holders can fit different sizes of cards. CF in some, SD in others."
2,Let down...,"After all the hype I read about Julia Fordham, whom I had never heard of, I was eagerly awaiting my first CD to arrive. I must say the first listen was a big let down. Great voice, but very poorly produced album. Why in the world would any one want tinny electronic sounds to accompnay this warm voice? I will give her another shot by trying out Porcelain before I write her off."
2,Julia Hype or?,"I guess you really have to be into this kind of sound, judging by all the happy gushing others have written about this album.Basically, for all of the talk about her singing, I found it absolutely grating. Her pitch wobbles constantly, sometimes never makes it. And ""lovin you"" -oh-my-god- I actually winced several times in the car listening to it - how did this ever make it to a production album??This is a album to enjoy while slightly depressed, sitting in front of the fireplace curled up with your fuzzy blankey, catching a buzz from the 1/2 bottle of wine you've consumed by yourself."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!,"What can I say? Julia Fordham is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing singer/songwriters in the world! I have been a huge fan since her first album came out in 1988 and she continues to sound better and better with age. This is another stellar offering from Julia and also her most solid album with not a single ""okay"" song amongst the bunch! I too wish she would get the recognition and acclaim she so richly deserves but as she knows, those fans that love her, love her intensely! If you have ever seen her perform live (which I have had the immense pleasure of many times!)you have truly experienced the full force and amazing range of this wonderful singer! Julia, we love you! It was worth the wait!!!"
3,A Lady of the Canyon?,"As a longtime (British) fan of Ms Fordham, I bought the CD as soon as I realised that it was finally available. My impressions are that it is close to ""East West"" in terms of style and while that probably suits her intended American audience, I fear that she is losing her European following. I would prefer less vocal gymnastics and a bit more concentration on a more ""traditional"" style.It's obvious that Julia works very hard at what she does, although she is becoming too West Coast for my liking. That said, ""Italy"" and ""The I Wanna Song"" are cracking songs, reminiscent in style of her UK-based days, and I just wish she could have delivered more of this. Having said all that, it's good to see a plucky Brit trying to plough her own furrow in the New World. (Please don't hate me Julia!)As a complement to this, try something by the Canadian/Aussie Wendy Matthews."
4,Sharp takeoff on Poe.,"I read this book after having read 12-13 of Poe's most popular short stories. I found the story to be frustrating at times due to Dupin's/Poe's erratic behavior. But if in fact Poe was like that in person, then Avi was just pointing out the effect of alcohol on a brilliant mind. It was interesting to see a writing genius having people problems, and slightly annoying to see him constantly raising Edmund's hopes and then thrashing him verbally as if he was not important at all. The story has a good ending and it made the journey worthwhile. I am homeschooling my sophomore son, and he just finished all of Poe's short stories. This story is next since he will have a little down time before we tackle ""Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde""."
1,The worst avi book,THIS BOOK IS THE WORST AVI BOOK EVER.Avi has written much many better books such as Wolf Rider. It has a really dull plot and ending. Even though someone gets killed it is one of the most boring books ever. It's good in the beginning but it gets horrible. I finished this book because I was already half way though with it. I would have rated this book a -10 stars but I couldn't so I do it now.
5,Genius,This was Dice raw. Think of Dice on stage with his thoughts being uncensored and traveling straight to the microphone. You have to listen to this a couple of times to understand what he is doing. He is not intent on getting lame belly laughs from a half dead crowd. He enters a new dimension here. This is not the normal Dice gig. But for those of us who really enjoy comedy and have an open mind it's pure genius. I listen to this and Pt 1 more than any other Dice cd now. Too bad it's OOP.
1,Take this title literally !,"If ever an album title described the contents, this is the one : a comedy album which manages to produce not a single laugh ! If you're into Andrew Dice Clay, avoid this one like the plague and focus on his other albums."
4,"melodic, peaceful album","The bassist for Poco,continues the tradition of being a Great Singer,Songwriter.This is a peaceful,melodic cd..""Soul Searchin"" does rock out."
4,"NICE!! If you want to buy it, go ahead!!","This book's main attraction is the color pictures. For some people, pictures are their main concern. This book covers a lot in the uniforms. Finding a book about the fascist Italy's uniforms are quite rare. I am pleased with this book. If more books (especially with color pictures) about the Italian military is available, than people who are interested in fascist Italy would be pleased."
2,Should've been interesting. . .,"This book had a lot of promise. Covert action? Very cool. The problem is, it's horribly written. There's an awful lot of sloppy mistakes and repetition. It's loaded with sentence fragments and poor grammer. (Or, ""the sentences are fragments and bad, bad written with."") It doesn't interfere with the substance, and maybe I'm being too particular that I couldn't focus on the subject--but I couldn't. It was obnoxious, distracting, and I finally put the book down about three chapters from the end. I'm even a history major--I'll read anything."
3,Secret History of Espionage Revealed,The secret history of our undisclosed espionage and covert agents who defend our liberty
2,Too basic,"I found the topics covered in ""Rewired, Rehired, or Retired?"" to be dated. Chapters dealing with globalization; assessing your needs and interests; and preparing for an interview; repeated facts I have read over and over again. If you our current on today's business trends (Business Week, Fortune, Wall Street Journal etc.) this book, in my opinion, is redundant."
2,Too many small part,We got this toy for our sons and it isnt all that great. The parts that you had to put together wouldn't stay on. it is suppose to fold into an portable toy but it didn't like to stay closed.
4,Good inexpensive watch,I've had this watch for a month or so and found it to be quite comfortable and everything works as advertised. The compass is fun to play with. The only con is that the wrist strap is a little short and just barely fits around my wrist (for whatever the average wrist size of someone a little over 6' might be). The display is very clear and easy to read even with my poor eyesight.
2,Not worth the money,The differentiating feature of this watch is the compass function. It simply does not work - not even close. In addition the watchband poorly designed - very uncomfortable and difficult to use.
3,"OK, but there are many better trance cd's","Some of the songs are good, but i must say im suprised that these songs are from a live act. This is not the kind of songs Tiesto usually plays. For some more energy tracking trance beats you should try to get Live at Energy 2000, but it's bootleg so it's kinda hard to get. The mixing on this album is good, but the songs are a bit up and down, some are good and some not so good. Many are old (Agnelli + Nelson - El Nino) and other are really overplayed on top 20 lists (Gouryella). But like my title says, there are many oter better trance albums other there. Check out DJ Stigma - Global Clubbing (Norway), DJ Lars Holte - In Trance We Trust 003 and any cd in the great Global Underground series."
4,"Good on Vancouver, slim on Victoria","Great book for the highlights of Vancouver, but don't buy it thinking it will have much about Victoria or Vancouver Island. Get the Frommer's book on Vancouver Island for that. Happy whale watching!"
3,Cordless screwdriver,Very powerful cordless screwdriver. Have to hang on or will twist away A little large but charge lasts. One problem tightening switch sticks so have to be careful when useing this setting
3,Fine for moon viewing but it struggles for other viewing,"I used the NexImager with my Celestron 130 SLT. It was very good for moon viewing but it struggled a bit with the planets. For example, I found that viewing Saturn through a normal eyepiece produced a better and sharper image than using the NexImage. Also the CCD resolution of 640x480 is low in this day when megapixel CCD's are commonplace even in low price cameras. My unit also produced a fair amount of noise when viewing a dark sky.But it is fun to play with and given it's low price, it is worth having.A more expensive and useful add-on would be to make it wireless to avoid the cable that runs from the telescope to your PC.As a side note, I'm using the NexImage with a Macintosh Macbook laptop. Though the software is written for a PC, I am using it fine via VMWare Fusion hosting a Windows XP OS."
1,I wasted my money and lost my patience with CELESTRON,"I recently bougth a camera and it is not compatible with Windows 7, and CELESTRON people said they don't have the drivers for W7 only for XP (Should i change my computer!!, ja...)- so my camera is in the box on the top of the bookshelf in my house - ít's very expensive to return it since I don't live in the USA. It's a gadget without future technology, in other words it is a waste of time and money."
4,She Hates Me DVD,"This film depicted a situation that was quite radical; but given the appropriate circumstances, the results were incredible. The moral of the story may be different for different people, but I got it. This DVD is a permanent addition to my collection. For the right crowd (no children), it's a great ""video party"" movie."
2,Check Carefully For INTERFACE!,"MY MISTAKE WAS TO NOT PAYING ATENTION TO FITMENT AND BELIEVING THIS WOULD INTERFACE WITH MY 2005 PONTIAC GRAN PRIX GT WITH MONSOON PREMIUM RADIO PKG. INSTALLER GOT HALFWAY THRU AND FOUND THIS WASN'T THE ONE FOR THIS CAR. OH WELL. NOW, I HAVE A NICE FM MODULATOR WHICH I PURCHASED FROM HERE.NOT A BAD PRODUCT. LOOKED GOOD IN THE BOX."
1,poor customer service,"I purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response."
3,Ultra II is NOT faster than Lexar 12X,"I bought a 512mb Ultra II and tested it against my Lexar 12X and a Viking 256mb (no X rating, but similar to the Lexar). In my Canon 10D the Ultra II was only 10% faster, and that was as good as it got. Rob Galbraith's test showed it to be 30% faster (I did the same test he did).I tested it in a SanDisk USB 2.0 reader hooked up to my desktop (Windows XP, Athlon 2800) and in a Delkin CardBus 32 PCMCIA Adapter (which is 5X faster than my old PCMCIA adapter - buy this!)in my laptop. The Lexar 12X was 17% faster at its worst, and 56% faster at its best! So is this the same card Rob tested, or are they putting Ultra II stickers on 12X cards?I called SanDisk tech support. They were very nice and exchanged my card for a new one. But the new one tested the same."
5,My favorite author,"The Lady Killer by Samantha Saxon was another magnificent book by this author. The main story is of English female assassin based in Paris during the Napoleon war. England sends a Viscount to get the assassin out the Paris and back to England. Of course he does not think the assassin could be a women and then feels he should stay in Paris to keep her safe. The two main characters are very strong and respect each other. It was a great read - check out all her book The Lady Lies, The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code."
4,Good overall coverage of topic,"This book covers many topics dealing with PICs, as well as multiple code examples for each project in both the PICBasic and PICBasic Pro languages. The code is fairly well explained and as a result most of the projects are fairly straightforward. However, this book has the problem many PIC books have, if you are not using the exact same programmer/interface/PIC chip as the author, you are left in a guessing game of how to modify the code in order to adapt it to your setup. Not the best intro book, but better than most."
4,Read and Learn,"Rosa Sola is a wonderful story that really hooks the reader on the first page. You will be rooting for Rosa throughout the book, but have a box of tissue ready when things don't go the way Rosa hopes. This book is not only a thoughtful, intriguing, powerful story it's a great book for writers to study. Author Martino knows the formula for a successful book."
1,Dictionary of Wars,"The information concerning dates of wars are in question. Due to the inefficiency of the work relating to dates, this publication can be costly to a researcher."
3,A True Labor Saving Book,"The first thing I always did with a new set of paints was create color swatches and mixes. Now that my paint sets are more expensive I hate to waste paint on swatches that I'll probably put in some ""safe"" location in the studio...never to be seen again. Here I can reference swatches of commonly used colors, opaque and transparent in a range of media. Sidaway also includes the best history of pigments that I've read to date - answering a question about phthalo blue that's been bugging me for years (when was it introduced? 1936.) This book is no substitute for learning about your palette, but does provide information on how to select an appropriate palette."
2,fairly useless,"save your money.I'm really surprised by the rave reviews -I'm a professional artist, but never studied color theory or mixing.What interests me is creating new colors from a limited palette, and understanding proportion - i.e mixing a good brown from an orange and a blue.In the acrylics section, the charts show are made by mixing a color with foundation palettes. (six different reds, and how they are altered by adding a bit of another color.)Basically, to have the range shown in the charts, you would have to have 59 different tubes of paint as a starting point.A much better book is the Parramon guide to painting ""the big book of oil painting""- he is able to create an amazing variety of colors from a red, yellow, blue, and white plus he give amounts and ratios of amounts of paint, taking into account tinting strength."
4,Wonderful compendium but a bit sloppy,"This volume is a definite must-have for aficionados of Napoleonic-era naval warfare, gathering in one place a mass of information on ships, sailing, and the infrastructure of the navy, in a very nice format at a more than fair price.My only criticism is the quality of the editing and proofreading, which allows spellings like ""seperate"" and errors like ""time"" for ""tide"". The author, or his editors, also have an irritating habit, when quoting contemporary documents, of spelling out ""&c."" as ""and co"", instead of ""et cetera""."
5,"This Book is, in a Real Sense","""........THIS BOOK IS, IN A REAL SENSE, a progress report based on the first five years of the Harvard University Social Studies Project, from 1956 to 1961.The work reported here was made possible by generous financial support from a number of sources as well as the intellectual and moral support of our colleagues and associates.....""[from the book of preface by Donald W. Oliver, James P. Shaver]"
2,Dice is going Hollywood and it shows,"Success was getting to his head at this point. He actually makes a serious effort at singing two songs at the end of this. I doubled over in pain in embarassment for him at this point. It's clear that his ego outgrew what he actually did best; raunchy nightclub comedy. Lures of Hollywood movies and TV sitcoms which he fell for made a great comedian die a most unflattering death. I gave this two stars for the occassional laugh I got a some bits, but most of them are tired and drawn out way too long. My guess is he made this CD so he could buy himself a limo for tooting around Hollywood in. It's a real shame Dice left his roots."
5,An incredible adventure story that actually happened!,"This book is extremely well written. It's filled with wit, adventure, and courageous characters. It's about a teen-age prince who goes on an incredible journey from a prison in Dublin where he was being held, to his home in Donegal, to save his province from Engish envaders.Set in a time of war and hatred, this book is so action-packed it's hard to believe it's a true story!"
3,Read it but don't buy it,"Red Hugh Prince of Donegal is a book about a teenaged boy who was captured by the English and was kept in prison for a long time. The English did not want him to become king because the English wanted Ireland for their own. This book was a fairly good book. Around the first 100 pages were lame but the rest was very good and exciting. There was some love stuff I personally didn't like much. If I were thinking about getting this book I would definitely think twice, check it out from the library and read it first."
1,=(,well r.i.p cadillac deville 1999 died 2010 when u put this in your car u need a box to let your alarm work if not your injector locks come into play little by little i blow 4 piston rings cuz of the presure and my start went out nourthstars have it in the middle of the motor did not have the money to fix got tickets and just junked it do not buy this
2,i found more life in vengaboys than in this,"i like to listen to music that encourages me to think and trascend in some way,so, i reject sounds that insult my inteligence. This gets boring and dull every second, there will allways something better to listen."
3,Christian,Considering that Christian of PHONEY is my X boyfriend.. I will give them 3 stars... It is a good jam... but they have done better.
4,Yummy Memories,"I went on my first cruise last year, and thought this would be a good addition to my memories--I was right! Beautiful photos and wonderful recipes so I can re-create the memories!"
3,It's Okay,"I thought I would love this CD, but it's just okay. There's nothing wrong with it, but my kids don't love it because they're used to the more fun songs. This is a good CD for babies maybe."
5,Jefferson Airplane Takes Off with Signe Toly Anderson,"Jefferson Airplane/ Takes off (with 8 bonus tracks): This is a great album. Signe Anderson is the female singer on this first Airplane album and she is wonderful. Grace Slick came along later (after Signe decided to leave the group in favor of a real life) but this album shows that Signe, at least vocally, would have carried the Airplane aloft just fine if she had stayed. The eight bonus tracks on this version of the CD adds much to the enjoyment of the album."
3,"Cute book, but not exactly what I was looking for","I was looking for a cute story to read to my son about putting on all of the winter layers of clothes to try to make it a more fun experience getting outdoors in cold weather. Though it's pretty straight forward in naming all the layers, some of the terms used for the different pieces of clothing are not what I usual call them so it's a bit confusing to remember them all. Overall, a cute story, but my son's just not that into it."
4,Interesting,"I thought the documentary was well done. I wish they would have done more at-home stuff with the kids they profiled the most to see how they interacted with their non-camp friends, but other than that it was pretty enjoyable. I thought it was perhaps a bit too short because we didnt really get to know anybody. It would have been interesting to have more about the coaches in there. It is definitely worth watching."
3,It Worked but Not Comprehensive,"I studied this book for maybe 2.5 hours on and off and it did not go over all terms and concepts on even the practice tests. Luckily I had a textbook to supplement and relied heavily on my previous knowledge as the CLEP is based on situational questions. I scored a 64 and took about 35-40 minutes to complete the test. Good buy though, just have something to supplement or have good common sense."
1,Sarah Palin Supporters Come Hither!!!!!!,"Hi,Do you support Sarah Palin or believe that she is the real mom of baby Trig? If so, then this movie is for you!!!!!!"
5,Great Resource,"I found this book very, very useful. I used exclusively for a recent trip and it provided the general information I like. It is compact and extensive, with lots of great pictures. If a reader wants detail, then they need a different resource."
3,Shark Attack 2 review,"Acutally, this is one of the better shark things I've seen other than of course the Jaws group!! If you can stand the gore get it and scare yourself out of going in the water. Shark lovers can say what they want about how sharks aren't the monsters they've been made out to be. As far as I'm concerned we might not be on their menu as the best food; but, they sure as hell will eat you as they didn't read the nonsense written about them and they just want to try anything out as a source of food as most wild animals do. I could have rated this one higher; but, decided it is at least highly okay!!"
2,This is NOT good!!,"It's sad when, even with high-tech special effects, Jaws, which was made in the 1970's, is still better than this.And how many times have people said it? SHARKS DO NOT ROAR!!!When sharks roar in movies, I don't find it frightening, I find it amusing."
2,THERE'S ALWAYS JAWS,"With the exception of JAWS and possibly DEEP BLUE SEA, you could take all these shark attack movies and lump them together; just change the actors, sometimes the location, but you end up with the same thing: poor special effects, so-so acting and some occasional laughs and/or thrills. This entry like the other two SHARK ATTACK movies is generic fluff, with little novelty or variety to distinguish it. The cast of Thorsten Kaye (as the studly hero), Nikita Alger (the hot diver) and Daniel Alexander (the studly if obnoxious Steve Irwin clone) gamely tries to breathe life, but this is just another movie in which the shark should have eaten the whole bunch."
3,Sharks that growl....hmmmmm?,"Ok, I amidit, I am a SHARK MOVIE LOVER. No matter how bad they are, I have seen them anyway. When I heard about the first SHARK ATTACK movie, I got giddy in all the right places. I bought it, loved it, and then bought the 3rd and second movies. The second one has alot of problems. One: Sharks don't growl. Who ever came up with that horrid idea should shoot them selfs in the head. Two: Sound problems. Sometimes the sound is so off that you can't help but laugh. Three: The story. A pack of mutated great whites that hunt only people. Yep, that is about it. Four: The acting. Horrible, thats all there is to say about that. Everything else, the directing, the camera work, and the somewhat funny humor is ok. Best camera I have seen in a B-movie style film(Halloween doesn't count. Because it is so much better than this movie). Watch if you must but don't buy it."
5,Another first-rate film by Romeo Muller!,"""Puff the Magic Dragon in the Land of the Living Lies"" tells the story of how Puff helps a young girl deeply troubled by her parents' divorce. It's a powerful, wise, and loving story. It's also yet another first-rate film by Romeo Muller, who also wrote the classic Animagic, Rankin/Bass Christmas films ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty the Snowman,"" among many other marvelous tales."
1,nothing,"no comment, was'nt what i wanted. i thought it was something when i had purchased the item. totally different. i was was not pleased. need to explain more about product before put on market for sale. that's it !!!!!!!"
3,lack of solid gameplay hurts Joe!,"This game has everything you love about VJ previous games, excellent graphics, over the top voice acting and animation, lots of humor BUT... gameplay is so chaotic that its very hard to enjoy playing it, its like the designers tried to put all kind of stuff in a ""smash bros."" kind of game. I've been playing the game for 3 weeks now, but I am unable to enjoy it more than 10 minutes! action gets totally out of control very easily and you cannot even see where you are in the screen of the psp! the game becomes a complete mess and the gameplay is not fun anymore."
1,Not what I would consider an Encyclopedia,"In my opinion, this book was a big disappointment. I was expecting more of an ""Encyclopedia."" The book provides incomplete lists of what specific pieces make a complete set in a particular color/pattern. The photos are lacking in detail making pattern identification difficult and/or just plain lacking so you can't determine what a particular piece to a set should even look like. A better title would be ""Examples of Depression Glass and Values."""
5,Great Book for collectors,"This book was great for identifying pieces, pictures are clear and easy to see. Also included prices for each item. It was missing a few things, but overall very used and a must have for every collector."
4,simple and helpful,"The book is quite simple but that's what makes it understandable, it was quite helpful to me. Unfortunately the source code could not be read completely from the floppy and the authors email is not valid (I would appreciate some help with that)."
1,It wounds my heart with monotonous languor.,I have never seen a top notch commercial compilationOf those I have seen this is the worst. The WORST.
2,Horrible Selection of Commercials,I bought this for my mother cause she loves vintage commercials but out of 15 hours of commercials she only recognized 10. Thank goodness I only paid 5 bucks for this.
1,Skip it,"The obscurity of the content rivals the poor A/V quality as a reason to skip this product. I bought this because it sounded like a fun idea, but this is a case of a good idea poorly executed."
5,Great American Pop Culture. Thanks Mill Creek!,"Great gems here including: the Indian shedding a tear over pollution of his beloved land, the hot chick turning out to be Smokey the Bear in a hot chick mask, smoking commercials, beer commercials, Mel Blanc's American Express ad, and on and on and on They even throw in a short film on the effects of cigarette smoking from Encyclopaedia Britannica. Great, great stuff if you like this sort of thing. The picture quality is passable. Look, the material is from dubious sources so don't expect THX quality. Just enjoy these gems from an earlier age for what they are: great pop culture."
2,Runs out of steam - fast,"Now - for the price, not bad - pretty cheap and yes, it does run very long - but the first bad news is the quality of the film, lots of eye-strain here and I understand that they would not spend the $$ to clean them up. There are lots of collections like this on Amazon and I'd really look over all reviews and maybe even drop a note to folks that liked the collection they purchased, before going with this one....fuzzy, grain and many were so discolored that it really was a strain on the eyes."
3,who thought this up?,"well,theres this boy whois gone mental and never ever talks.so one night this magic dragon takes him into a paper world where they battle symbolic images of the childs problems.sort of a intensive crash psychotherapy.the kid perks up.the end.kids kind of like it,but not really.id likew to point out that the dragon does not die as many belived he did in the song.actualy,he doent in the song either.so no deaths.thats a plus since this is a childrens movie.it is very emotional to watch the mentaly ill jackie draper suffer through his emotional problems.it is very much consistent with the book.when the dragon fixes jackie and hes better then he leaves,that part really sucks!"
2,Not a good choice for me,My child is 2 1/2 years old . She watched about 10 minutes into the movie and appeared to be quite frightened by some of the images. The story line appeared to be sensible but not one that a toddler will understand. At the end of the day I do not think the point of the story is what she remembers as much as she will remember the scarry pirate.
1,don't bother,the first one was good the second was great. the third i left on top of my car and drove away and this one i might do the same to.
5,Great Gag Gift,I got this for a tacky Santa gift at my office. It was the most popular gift! My co-workers are still talking about it.
2,What a let down,This isn't a guidebook at all! It's a brief overview of some landmarks in NY. If you've never been to NY and don't know the difference between Brooklyn and Manhattan then this will clear things up. But if you are looking for something to help plan a vacation this is not it.
5,This book has kept me going for over 15 years!,Hearing God has been an inspiration to me for many years. This really makes you believe that God is speaking to you. It is the perfect gift for someone who needs daily encouragement.
5,Astonishing,"This book was given to me by a friend as a parting gift when I moved to another city in 1995. I have read it almost daily since then and still wonder if the pages don't change places sometimes. There are many days when the devotional is so specific to what I need to hear that it almost feels like God is talking to me through this book. I certainly understand why she hesitated to publish it because ""it was too personal"". I'm very glad she did because it feels very personal to me too. Thank you Lory."
2,Bland & Weak Collection of Noodling Tracks,Nothing really terrible but mostly a serious of bland and un-inspiring background music tracks that are neither chill or even new age. They're even not distinctive enough for soundtracks music. There are some exceptions but hardly worth it to get it for the 1 track that's excellent (the Chere Isis track) or the 3 or 4 tracks that are pretty good pop trip hop dance tracks but even those are nothing to shout about - just above the quality of most of these tracks.Even if you're just starting out as a lounge/dance chill music collector - these are so bland you'll stop collecting :-) so there's not much here - everyone can move on.
3,The album was better!,"I first heard this album in 1970 when I was able to get a free copy after the base store was throwing them away because it was too psychedelic (acid rock). The best album ever to listen to while on LSD. I wore out 3 copies of the album, and bought the CD when it came out in '96. This CD adds too much to something that was perfect to begin with."
4,Fresh New Talent,"Chris Blasingame, Traci Carroll, Chad Etchison, Jennifer Farmer, Ali Selim, Michael Shoob and David Zeiger. Never heard of them? You will. I was really impressed by the creativity, perserverence and resilience that these filmmakers displayed in getting their projects completed --most of whom have not been to film school. I've been working in the entertainment business for years and it's always inspiring to read stories about talented and enthusiastic newcomers. If there is anyone out there looking for fresh new talent, I'd get in touch with these folks before someone else beats you to them."
1,Simply awful,"Now, I love pretension as much as anyone, but this was ridiculous! Most of the the ""filmmakers"" (if making a single short film can qualify you as filmmaker) are a bunch of unproven shmos who have no idea what they're talking about. They offer no relevant information whatsoever, unless you happen to have a lot of money already, or your parents will happy give you the tens of thousands of dollars you want to make you ""art"". A bunch of nonsense. Quiet frankly, if the book hadn't made me laugh so hard, I probably would have thrown it away after the first chapter."
2,Exotic,"The food looks great, but most things call for some fancy ingredients. I don't have enough room in my kitchen for all the ingredients he wants you to have always on hand. I would certainly buy things to use in a recipe occcasionally, but a lot of things I don't think I would use again. The ""well-stocked kitchen"" things are mostly conventional, but I can't keep on hand several kinds of potatoes, several kinds of oils, several kinds of vinegar, and so on. He also wants you to grow your own herbs. I will probably make up a few of these, but the concept of ""fast food"" is destroyed by having to go out and buy the ingredients first."
2,Seven Girlfriends for One Guy,"Okay,the title doesn't have the ring of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""Tim Daly plays Jesse,the Chef Who Can't Commit.As his character has problems with commitment,so does the director with the tone of the movie.Is it drama?Is it romantic comedy?Is it supposed to be funny?To complicate matters,there are dream sequences,such as when his ex-girlfriend who died in a car crash comes alive at her funeral.There's a love scene within an inflating hot-air balloon(???)There are incriminating photographs that fall from a ceiling,and eventually land in pudding&among; mourners.There's an endless drive with the insomniac heroine.There's even a scene when Jesse meets up with a lesbian ex-girlfriend.The hero's ""self-discovery"" isn't exactly convincing since the director doesn't seem to know what genre to use.This belongs in a cheesy film festival,not ranked with ""High Fidelity.""It doesn't take itself seriously;neither should you."
5,Sixth season,"Sixth season...we fell in love with the characters over the years and are sorry to see them go, but we learned from them, we laughed and cried with them and enjoyed their lives. Sounds like a crazy person talking right? Well...really this show gets to you...you can watch for hours and hours and still love it. Watch them again and again and again. My daughter has SCRUBS parties where her and her friends sit around and watch the episodes...a house full of teenagers quiet and watching intently. WOW!"
5,The best season since the 3rd.,"Some are saying that this was the worst season, but I always thought the 5th one was. Not only was this not their worst year, I think it was their best since the 3rd season. It was hilarious throughout and had some great emotional moments."
2,NBC Kills Scrubs,"So headless doctor is still around, the only religious person on the show is killed off, abortion is a casual conversation, and one of the episodes turns disgustingly political... was NBC demanding the writers make this season awful so they wouldn't have to sign anymore seasons after 7?This was a funny show that had potential, until it was smothered to death by the writers with retarded fantasies and awfully bad jokes and terrible storylines.Stick to the older season when the show was still worth watching."
4,I <3 Scrubs,I think that the Dvds were in excellent condition. The only thing wrong was that whatever came in the Dvd when first bought (small page inside flap) was missing and there was a tear on that page. I've already enjoyed the entirety of Scrubs season 6 about four times
3,Scrubs season 6,A good season and very enjoyable. If your a scrubs fan you will enjoy.Definitely worth a look.
5,Taylor's Attic - Fun!,"I accidently found this dvd for kids and bought it for my grnadsonwhose name is Taylor. He's 5 and he and his sister, age 2 love it.I've watched it myself and enjoy it also."
1,Great Numbers Game Video Review by a Mom of a 2 year old,"I have a 2 year old daughter that ADORES the Sesame Street Characters, especially Elmo. We have many Sesame Street videos that she asks to watch very often but when I put this one on for her she was not happy.First off, Elmo, Telly & the 2 little girls are hardly in it. The video tape mostly shows the little cartoon skits. That's usually fine but on this tape it's back to back skits with hardly any Muppets in between them.My daughter quickly became bored and actually asked me for a book while this tape was on.Something she has NEVER done while Sesame Street tapes are on! It simply could not hold her attention.If you want a good Sesame Street Counting tape try ""1,2,3 Count With Me"".It doesn't have Elmo in it but features Ernie instead. That one holds her attention and she's learning how to count because of it."
2,Poor graphics and no continuity,"This is the first Sesame Street Dvd that our 16 month old actively dislikes. A series of older sesame street cartoons are strung together very loosely by Telly, Elmo and two kids on a computer generated background. There is really little action from the characters themselves - no real dialogue or singing or anything which is what my son really enjoys. So, this one was a loser in our household. If you child prefers the cartoons to the actual characters, it could be the perfect dvd for you though..."
2,Boring,My son is three and was bored quickly by this video. Perhaps a younger child might enjoy it more.
2,PreK mom,The characters are adorable but the speed of the counting in this video is fast paced. If your child is a visual learner this may not be the DVD for you because the actual numbers are only briefly flashed on the screen.
1,not a new item!!!!,"All the other similar videos I purchased were great but whoever sold this particular video sold it as new and it obviously was not, so thanks alot. Hey I's ask for my money back but I work 2 jobs and I'm too tired and too busy to waste my energy!!!!!"
2,"Poor quality, boring DVD","I was disappointed with this DVD and would not buy it again. The animation was poor quality and made the character's movements look jerky. The actors who did the voices sounded very artificial. The story was not engaging. The counting song is not particularly singable.All this said, my three year old daughter is willing to watch it and then watch it again immediately after that . . . but I prefer videos we can both enjoy..."
1,Okay,"The dress itself was pretty but when my step-daughter tried the dress on, the bow of roses fell off the clip on the floor.The roses were not glued down well and it just came off in the process of simple handling."
3,Wrong part shipped twice,I ordered the Power Paw Model # 62550 A which is designed to vacuum stairs steps both vertical and horizontal.Instead I received the 62550D which is designed to pick up pet hair.The picture in the website clearly shows the model A.Neither Deerso nor Amazon were able to figure out how to get me the right model
1,"Born: June 29, 2009. Died: August 19, 2009. R.I.P.","The Eureka Power Paw cannot handle my Eureka 600 air watt central vacuum. It will be returned to W*****t tomorrow for a refund. I'll try a Hoover hand vacuum and see how long that will last. So, here goes the Power Paw's obituary:Born: June 29, 2009. Died: August 19, 2009. R.I.P."
1,Power Paw???,"Don't purchase this product. This was my second Power Paw, the first came with the Eureka upright vacuum I purchased, which I am happy with. The first quit working after two or three uses as did the second one. Save your money and buy the 7.0 amp Dust Devil hand held vacuum. It works like a charm on stairs whereas the Power Paw is a joke!!"
2,LaR's evil twin made this album,LaR is my favorite band. this is the only album by them i have sold to ... . they just don't seem to be cut out for this techno music. at least on this album they had practice so they could do an incredibly better job on lift. i do like two of the songs on the album but i forgot the names. daniel ash is more a metal kind of guy...right?
4,Good product,"This works great. I am adding a bridge because I moved my router. It takes some time to figure out what products are needed, but once you do, you will love it. Everyone thinks it is cool. Ipod use is difficult but possible."
1,WHY WOULD ANYONE WATCH THE CENSORED VERSION?,"I just don't understand. Why would anyone watch this censored version? The UR version is out there, I own it on DVD. Amazon should realize that movie goers want the unadulterated version of any movie that's out there. I'm surprised they only offer this R rated version, Blockbuster I could understand, but I always thought Amazon had a truer aesthetic when it comes to presenting movies in their original, as-intended-by-the-director-to-be-seen version."
2,Not 3D but worth a look if you like weird stuff.,"Buyer beware for this is not in 3D, as originally produced. Strange, sexy and violent re-working of the story of Frankenstein. This sort of thing did a good business in select art-houses and dives at the time it was made and relates to a lot of stuff that was going on in the arts at the time."
4,Good Book,"I have read this book, and thought it was definitely well done. It explained the tools, supplies, and the knowledge you will need to be a competent robot builder. At the end of a book is a detailed list of books, magazines and web sites for where you can go from this book. The book was great, although the only thing I didn't like was that the three projects were hard to follow. I didn't quite understand all of the actions I needed to take, and these chapters lost me pretty quicky.Still, the book is great to get you going, and has an excellent amount of resources at the end, and I like the author a lot and hope to read another of his books later."
4,Excellent Book,I would highly recommend this book as both a beginning level resources as well as a shelf reference for the more experienced DBA. I love the format and layout. This makes it easy to find what you need.
5,DB2 Simplified,I found this book extremely comprehensive. The use of screen captures in partnership with textual descriptions are so much better. Bravo to those who took the time to create a fantastic learning and reference tool!
2,Black Fist [Slim Case],"1974 blaxplotation movie had a decent plot of a L.A. street fighter from the slums with dreams of making it big as a champion boxer works for gangsters to make ends meet. The film transfer here is awful,so awful in fact that at times hurt my eyes to look at.I picked this up for a dollar at a dollar store along with Black Terminator. One dollar is exactly what you should keep your budget at when buying anything that comes in slim cases."
3,"Like them, not sure they are necessary...",I bought these and they are fine but I am no sure they are necessary. I think overall I could have purchased cheap craft sticks from Wal-Mart and gotten the same result. The edge of a regular 'Popsicle'stick would have worked fine
1,Absolute Junk!,"Unfortunately these were installed in house we purchased 18 months ago. I replaced a couple of bulbs soon after as they were already blown. Now 18 months later and within the space of a couple of weeks I find myself needing five replacements, this includes two that I know I replaced last time. As other reviewers have mentioned the bulbs last nothing like the claimed 10,000 hours, I am guessing at a couple of hundred hours at most.I refuse to spend over $50 to replace these, I am cutting our losses and installing something else instead.AVOID!"
3,Nice Light Low Quality,"Similar comments as others, but I'm in the middle. I haven't seen any under-cabinet lighting where the replacement bulbs don't cost as much as or near the price of the sets. These lasted much longer than those crummy little Halogens I had before, but no where near 10,000 hours. I've had two out of nine burn out in a year. They are cheaply made and a real drag to get the bulb in the base. The light is good, it's not hot like the Halogens. I'm holding off replacing until LEDs come down in price. I just wish I could find those $7.50 replacements one other reviewer mentioned. Buy LED if yo can afford them. The prices are getting better."
2,Daikatana 2?,"Team fortress was one of the most widely accepted and best loved modifications for the original Quake. Knowing that their program was bound to be a hit, Valve took the idea running and spliced it into Half-Life, a game based on a combo of the Quake 1 and Quake 2 engines. It was lit like wildfire and Team Fortress Classic mania spread accross gaming circles. As the Half-Life engine grew older, people began to cry out for more, and thus, the idea for Team Fortress 2 was born. Unfortunately, this was over a year ago, and after several incarnations, Team-Fortress 2 is still being hammered together. While dedication to a product is a wonderful thing, I'm afraid that this will turn out to be another Daikatana 2. An aged engine struggling to new ideas of gameplay. In the PC gaming industry technology is updated as fast as light, and unless Valve wants to develop a new engine from now until eternity, when this comes out it will look and play like a two year old game."
2,Very disappointed!,"I order this pup for my 7 year old daughter. She wanted a pet pup was christmas, but since she can't have one. I bought this one. I 'm so disappointed ! This pup does not look like the picture above and is too small. 10 inch long not even 12 inch as stated. I dont think it was even worth $10. Looks like an ordinary stuffed animal to me. Does not look real life at all like theAurora Plush 12"" Pal, Aurora Babies Pug Pup by Aurora . I think I will be returning this pup. So disappointed."
5,THIS WAS GREAT! Don't listen to everyone else!,"Despite what others have said, this is a fantastic book. The series is unfolding just as it is meant to. DOYLE FOR KING!!!"
2,Same story different setting,I'm very disappointed. I feel I'm re-reading the Anita Blake series with a little different twist.A dark haired busty short female that for one reason or another has to sleep with multiple men. In both series one of the men has a scarred face to prove that she is a caring sensitive woman that doesn't mind imperfection. I'm on book 4 and I'm not going further with the series.Jean Claude = FrostAsher = RhyesJason = GalenNathaniel = KittoMicah = Darkness - Doyle
2,It's like soft-porn! Except worse!,"Out of all LAURELL K. HAMILTON's books, this is by far the worst. It took me almost two weeks to read this book becuase I kept wanting to put it down and read something with a little more...plot.The story basically follows along the same lines as the last two in this series did. Princess Meredith must get pregnant and beat her cousin Cel in order for her to win the throne. So, of course, she starts sleeping with everything -including demin-gods and goblins- in sight (who all just HAPPEN to be lusting after her). Sounds like fun, right? Wrong. There's lots and lots of sex. Over described, BORING sex that makes you wish someone would throw Ms Hamilton's theasaurus out the window and burn it.Although, to look on the bright side, I'm sure her writing cant get any worse. Or at least, I hope it cant."
2,A very disappointed fan - LKH continues her downward trend,"This book feels like LKH finished only half a manuscript by the time her deadline rolled around. You know how most book jackets give a teaser about the contents of the book? Well, this teaser summarizes everything that happens in the book.Seduced by Moonlight continues the downhill trend that's been evident in LKH's most recent Anita Blake novels. I think people who were originally drawn in by the characters are now just staying around to see if anything happens to them. Too bad there's so little plot/character development in this book!"
2,Only 2 chapters worth of plot-get this one at the library,compared to the density of the first book about Merideth Gentry this one was hopelessly watered down. So much time was spent discovering new powers that no one had a chance to USE them.and the sex scenes were loooooong. so long i got bored-and i'm always up for a little titillation in a novel. The last bit started to get good but it was really only one conflict and resolution in a book that deserved three or four.I hate to say it but i was disappointed. Get this one at the library
2,"Repetitious, Boring, Uber-Liberal Trash","I have a 45 minute commute to work every day, so I have been listening to these on audiobook. I quit the Anita Blake series after ""Micah"" because it seems Laurell K Hamilton gets distracted by whatever is going on in her own life and focuses the entire plot on her own corner of personal fantasy. These books are soaked in sex, but somehow she manages to make it completely BORING. Also, her vocabulary is incrediby limited. In 15 minutes of listening, the phrase ""my body"" or ""his body"" was used 53 times!!! Very distracting... Get back to the story, we want to actually hear a STORY, not about how a Fae are equal and wearing fur is bad.Also-WTF? Why does she create all of these strong male characters and have them all start CRYING??? Doyle CRYING??? SERIOUSLY??? I believe Ms. Hamilton has absolutely no knowledge of real men and is writing from a very ill-informed standpoint, besides having a fetish for giving oral sex."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I enjoyed getting to peek in on Merry's world again but nothing really happened, no one grew or changed, no relationship deepened and little to nothing was explained. The scene with Andais demonstrated that the Queen is gaining respect for Merry and knows her own son does not deserve to rule but that's about all that changed there. And for all the horsing around in the bed did anyone notice that there wasn't one consummation that could result in pregnancy? Lots of weird stuff but no one got down to the business of getting Merry with child.Check this one out from the library, you won't get much for your hardcover money."
2,Not Seduced At All...,"Definately not enough meat to the story in my opinion. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen, for the story to form, and next thing I know the book was over! I'm usually a fast reader but this book only took me about 5 hours to complete. And all the new men...I had trouble keeping most of them straight because they weren't developed. I ended up with a lot of questions and more than a little frustrated. I'm hoping that Ms. Hamilton wrote too much and divided the book in two, because I would hate to think that shes losing her touch."
1,"My advice to you, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","This book drags on forever. If your a sex fiend, this is the book for you, if not, then stay away! It is soft core porn the whole way through. Meredith repeatedly has sex with most of the men she comes into contact with. The charactors are hard to remember, there is just so many of them. The book was hard to get through, and each event in the story felt like it lasted forever. I am a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton, but it seems as if this series is going nowhere."
2,Confused...,"As a fan of both the Merry Gentry and Anita Blake series, I was very disappointed. Not only was this book lacking a proper plot in my opinion (what happened to Merry's career?) but I felt no connection with any of the new characters (had trouble keeping track of most of them) and no reconnection to the old characters (MORE DOYLE PLEASE!)Of course if you are a true Hamilton fan it is a must read, but I suggest you wait for the paperback."
4,Really like this tray,Did alot of searching for trays and this fits the bill. It can be folded down when you fold the walker. Sits nice and level. Really like it.
2,there are better sticker books available,"For a first learning books the concepts are age apropriate but the stickers are all over the place making this book difficult to use for young learners who might get easily distracted. Usborne and Sesame Street books seperate the stickers by page using colours or lines, thus limiting the choice and making this product much easier to use."
5,Italian Sword Study,"I found Arte Gladitoria Dimicandi, 15th Century Swordsmanship of Master Fillipo Vadi to be an invaluable resource to a student of Italian swordsmanship. In the spirit of Fiore dei Liberi, Vadi has put in writing and especially spectacular color illustration plates of the various stances, etc used by the 15th century long swordsman. The translation is excellent and the editorial and references are equally helpful.This book is a 'must have' for any historian or student of the sword."
5,A breakdown and some tears,"This volume may not be the best in the whole Nadesico series, but it's close. In the first episode, the Admeral completely loses it and threatens the lives of the Nadesico's crew. The second episode features a story about Ruri that shows she's not as cold and unemotional as she seems. How both episodes turn out is something you'll have to see for yourself...just be assured that it's moving...."
1,4 3 2 1,"Very disappointing, all the best scenes were strung together in the preview....It was hard to care what happened to any one in the film"
5,A very informative book,This book was very comforting to my wife and me when she went through a depression after our second child. It caught us so off guard. We were hungry for information. This book helped us understand postpartum issues and how to get help.
3,Interesting if not always applicable suggestions for Christian communities,"There are some good concepts in this book that apply to any attempt to live in Christian community, but a lot of the content is very technical - how devotionals should be structured, why people shouldn't sing harmonies, an evening routine as opposed to the morning routine - and hard to apply to groups that are not structured like the one Bonhoeffer experienced. Overall, I found this intellectually interesting, but it has not left a very lasting effect on me."
2,BORING,"I had to get this book for a Communications class. I have to say, this book is extremely hard to focus on. I agree with some of the points Bonhoeffer makes about community, but others are quite abstract and hard to understand. It takes me about an hour to read one chapter when typically in a more interesting book I could read the same amount in half the time!"
1,Actiontec PCMCIA PC Card reader,"I too fell in to the 'not enough information/description' provided syndrome. This reader only supports 5 volt cards, and if you wish to use it with a 3.3 volt card it is 'NOT' supported. My use was with the Verizon PC5740 wireless Broadband Internet modem/phone card for a laptop, and a desktop computer. Being able to interchange between both as needed. Why a producer would not support both voltages is beyond me. Another 'live and learn' episode!"
3,For memory cards it's fine,"I've used a few of these, for reading memory cards and PCMCIA-format HDDs.Since the PCMCIA form factor is pretty standard, many flash memory cards have PCMCIA adapters, and this works fine for every one I've tried: MicroSD, SD, SDHC, CF+, CF, Microdrive (all with PCMCIA adapters)Based on the other reviews it seems this isn't going to give you laptop-slot functionality."
5,Power to the Black Panters,"I love the song ""fight the power"" witch was the best back in 1989 off of the soundtrack movie ""Do the Right Thing"". Chuck D and Flava Fav both raping at the same time on that song ""it takes a nationof millions to hold us back"". Public Enemy along with DWA were the first rappers to say curses words in their ablums."
4,Let the sequals begin...,"set only minutes after the origional ends, HALLOWEEN 2 takes us through the rest of the night with Laurie as she tries to escape her brother in a hospital where she is being held until she can get better. The night is not up and the killings have not ended and this sequal in no way compares to the origional but is a great movie. It is also handled a little differently than the origional. But no matter how it is hadled it will always be one of the best in the HALLOWEEN series, for many reasons, but the main is because this is one of the last Jammie Lee Curtis is in. H20 and RESSURECTION are the last 2 she stars in before RESSURECTION stupidly decides to kill off her character. After this sequal the whole series heads down the road of FRANCHISE and gives us lame sequals..."
4,Not A Bad Little Sequel...,"OK, later on that same halloween night in Haddonfield, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is whisked away to the hospital, only to be stalked by her demonic shadow, Michael Myers. Laurie is her old quivering, yet resourceful self. Michael is the unstoppable dreadnaut of death. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still raving about Michael and stalking the evil stalker. The hospital setting is cool and adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. I love Laurie and Michael's ""relationship"". She's the magnet and he's the murderous iron shaving. They are drawn together by forces beyond them both, as the perfect killer / victim. I recommend Halloween 2, especially for it's excellent chase sequence between Laurie and Michael. Watch H2 as a double feature w/ the original..."
