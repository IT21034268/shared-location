1,Don't Bother,"Utterly forgettable. Neil may still be a great concert performer, but he sure put out some stinker albums. This is another album full of the same schmaltzy crapola that he has been recording for a long, long time now."
4,Difficult,My grand daughter is 7 and we are finding that she can not do this without an adult with her.
1,Does not work--AWFUL design,"My grandniece wants to sew--bought this with her birthday money. The stiches do not hold--just unsecured loops through the fabric--unravelled instantly. Set-up, especially threading, is extrememly difficult. she even tried exchanging it for another thinking maybe she got a lemon--the 2nd was the same. She was sorely disappointed. And it was a big waste of everyone's time as we all struggled to try to make it work. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
5,Magnificent!,"The first time I listened to Colour And Still, I marveled at Chantal Kreviazuk's voice. She has a wonderful voice and it is only a matter of time before the rest of America hears her beautiful voice. I am glad I bought this CD."
5,Que Grupaso!,"I bought this CD out of curiosity, I didn't even know how they sounded. Once I got the CD though, Damn, I kept repeating Dejalo al Tiempo and Dejate Llevar. Arriba la Musica Nortena/Tejana! Arriba Zacatecas!"
2,Lame and boring,"Other than the flashy colors, this toy is a bummer! My son has virtually ignored this toy since day 1. Maybe he just doesn't get it. But I'd skip this one."
5,my son's favorite toy,This is by far his favorite toy. It squeaks and makes crinkle noises and is super brightly colored. It's the only toy he gets excited about and yells for before I hand it to him :) I'm looking up new Lamaze toys now! Love them.
5,Jacques Rocks!,"I have no idea why but my son adores this toy. He loved this toy months before he even noticed other toys. It was one of the few things that would keep him happy in the car (he hates the carseat). We have two other similar Lamaze toys and while he likes them too, they did not have the same effect as this one. I think it's the large eyes."
3,Freddie the Firefly is better,"I bought both the Firefly and the Peacock and they are basically the same item (and the same price) except that the Firefly has a lot more to offer with regard to textures and baby's interest. The Firefly has much more to chew on and many more textures and trinkets to keep him entertained. And at the same price, why not go for the one that offers the most? Peacock is nice, but gets boring to baby after a while with only crinkle-wings, a small mirror, virtually nothing to chew on and a useless squeeze-horn. Not a bad buy, just not the best. Stick to Freddie the Firefly."
5,Excellent toy!,"This was a wonderful toy for my new born. I wasn't sure about buying my 6 week old a toy, but after researching this toy online i decided to buy it am am so glad I did. From the first day I showed it to her she loved it. the colors were perfect and on the back its all black and white. She must stare at her toy for at least 10 minutes before getting bored. Its soft and has many different textures. The wings crinkle and make noise which keeps her interested. This is a great toy and I will be getting it for friends who are expecting."
2,Not as easy to grab,We have both the Lamaze Jacques the Peacock and the Lamaze Freddie the Firefly. The baby instantly took to the firefly absolutely loving it from 3 months to 6 months. The peacock was much harder for him to hang on to and despite being similar in style was ignored. If I had a choice I would go for the firefly instead...Lamaze Freddie the Firefly
5,Terrific Toy!,"We got both the Firefly and the Peacock Lamaze toys and my baby loves them both equally. They are colorful, fun, have many textures and make different noises when handled. I had read good reviews on these toys and the reviews were right! My baby is nearly six months old now and began playing with these about a month ago. She really loves to chew on them and make the crinkle and crunch in her hands. These are some of her favorite toys overall. I think that although the Lamaze toys are a bit more expensive than others, that they are well worth the price."
5,Fabulous toy,Wonderful toy!! It is great with the black and white with red on the back side for intial few months. Then as your child gets older you can turn it to the front and they can play with everything. The different textures on the front are great as well as the squeaker in the toy. My daughter loves Jacque and looking at him as well as grasping the crinkly feathers.
1,BOYCOTT UNTIL SEASONS 5-8 ARE OUT!,"This is INSANE. Where the Hell are seasons 5-8? How can they release the series finale FIRST? I'm annoyed (as is everyone). And yeah, I was angry over ""Friends"" for the same thing. It's been forever since season four was released, and I say that we all BOYCOTT the series finale DVD until at least seasons 5 and 6 are out! I feel like I ""just watched that episode"" every time I pull out seasons 1-4 because the discs only go ""so far!"""
2,A Genuine Letdown,"WARNING: SPOLIER AHEAD WARNING: SPOLIER AHEAD WARNING: SPOLIER AHEADAfter 8 years on the air, ""Will & Grace"" ended its run with one big anticlimax. While the opening dream sequence was amusing, it ran too long and the episode relied too much on the theme it set and exists as several underwelming fast forward that tells us that Will and Grace had no contact with each other for close to 20 years and are only reunited via an absurd and totaly unbelievable coincidence. The closing scene of Will, Grace, jack and Karen drinking a toast many years from now would have had considerably more power had it not been for the preceding hour. Lackluster and not very satisfying."
2,Not that great,after season five which wasnt that great either show went downhill and the season finale wasnt very good either. Them not speaking for two years turned me write off. I think the best season finale i have seen of a show that i didnt watch to much was Everybody Loves Raymond. I wasnt a regular watcher but the show ended plan and simple with no big endings. It ended like any other episode.
5,the end of a great show,I hated when this show went off. They just don't make good shows anymore. This is great to go with my collection of all seasons of Will & Grace.
5,A Great Season Finale,"If you can only afford to buy one of ""Will and Grace's"" DVDs, this is the one to get. It is a great wrap up to a great series. They did a great job. It is a tribute to friendship, to ""The Circle of Life"" and FUNNY on top of that. Get it, worth every penny. If you can get others, go ahead, but this you will be so glad you own and can watch."
2,Finale Already??,Hard to believe that the Finale is being offered when the entire series has not yet been released. I wish the networks / producers would release the complete seasons in a timely manner instead of making us wait so long. Makes one wonder why so many people suggest purchasing television programs on dvd from amazon.uk which seems to have the dvd's quicker for many shows.
4,I DO LOVE IT!!!!!,"I'm so glad ""W&G;"" finished like that.It has no something new and something surprising, but THAT was just as well.I pause to realize it is not only ""Will and Grace"" but ""Jack and Karen"".They (I mean creators) also finished ""Jack and Karen""'s story with full of happiness.If you ask me, only one bad thing about ""W&G;"" is series5~8 haven't released yet as DVD.I don't know why and why series final was released independently.(So I rated it 4 stars)I hope all of series will be released soon!!!!!"
2,Wrong LP,"This is the wrong item advertised. Trooper has two self-titled albums and the one for sale is the first self-titled album, from 1975, which the one review indicates clearly. The pictured second self-titled Trooper album was released in 1980 and was only available on cd as a Japanese import. It is obviously no longer available unless a used cd copy can be found anywhere. I would like to hear from anyone who knows where I can obtain a new or used copy of the cd.Jamie SzydlowskiCanada"
4,Good book for season five die hard fans.,"The book is really cool, and has a lot of neat pictures but I was a bit disapointed. It should have said Official Guide to season five."
4,A fork doesn't cut like a knife,"This kit allows servicing front end components without the risk of damaging boots and hammering on components to ""pop"" them loose. The variety of tools allows the technician to determine the best tool for the circumstances. They work very well. Make sure to grease all threads to increase tool longevity."
1,I book that Icanit believe I finished,the book Planet of Junior Brown had some good parts but not enough to make the story worth reading it is a long book with no beginning end or middle.NOTHING HAPPENS this book babbled on and one about nothing.
4,Great Gift,"Timely gift for a younger generation who missed these. Lots of shared laughter during time together. This is a keeper, hand-me-down."
5,Fantastic! Que Vivan Todo Los Latinos En El Mundo!!,"This is the first ""Cuban"" addition to my ever growing collection of latin music and it may very well be all I need. This collection satisfies every mood especially the one to get on your feet and move! Great compilation of latin sounds paying tribute to a beautiful land. This disc inspires me to take a trip to Cuba for a firsthand look at the beauty all these musicians are singing about with such passion ...VIVA CUBA!"
1,"the worst movie ever, and you sent me two, one is all i ordered","NO GOOD.WASTE OF MONEY, wouldn't ever keep this movie in my house, gave it to a friend, he is from scotland hope he will make somthing out of it. but i think it going to be a frizbee."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,Please do yourself a favor and check this company out via the California BBB. They are complete CONS!
2,Not as expected,"Received shipment promptly. Bottle much smaller than expected, however, drops works well for small dogs. Will order biggerbottle next time."
2,What the heck is wrong here?,I guess that in an attempt to prevent sounding old Fey has gone out and lefte behind the energy that has brought her to where she is at now. The whole album has mostly acoustic sounds and has very few dance beats. If you like fey's upbeat and energy filled songs then you probably will be disapointed with this album. Diselo con Flores and Vuelve are the most upbeat songs in the album. The rest sound like they lack in effort and as if they were made just to put something out there. But maybe if your leaning toward the more acoustic pop this is probably great for you especially for a Fey fan. It also has some good romantic songs. If you like the old school fey then leave this album alone unless your a hard core fan. And if you love romantic songs get this.
5,El Color de los Sueños es super!!!,"Tengo el nuevo cd de fey, antes de que saliera a la venta, yo ya lo habia encargado!! esta super buenisisimo!!!! super adictivo y con temas super originales como el color de los sueños, flor de un dias!!! pd. si alguien sabe como pueda yo conseguirme el 2nd cd en portugues, comunicate con migo!!!"
2,Too Much to Digest,"Sorry, guys. It was a great idea, intriguing plot, but it just didn't work for me. Too many characters, too much ponderousity, too many unpronounceable names. I made it about a third of the way before giving up"
2,"IT GETS THE JOB DONE, BUT...","BUT IT IS REALLY CHEAP LOOKING WHEN YOU GET IT. AND, THERE ISN'T AS MUCH SPACE AS I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE...NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD EITHER."
5,"Unbelievable, Fantastic Products !!","My 8 year old dog has been through 2 tooth cleaning surgeries and I didn't want to put her through another, so I thought I'd try these products to improve the tartar build up on her teeth. She didn't really care for the taste of the gel, so at breakfast time I mix it with about 1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter and she eats it all up. I withhold water for half an hour so the gel sits on her teeth a while. At bedtime, I give her 3 sprays of the spray. I have been doing this for 13 days. Today I scratched at the tartar with my nail....and it cracked right off. I cannot believe my eyes !! I have scratched all her teeth and they are now all an amazing pearly white. Buy these products and never subject your dog to tooth cleaning surgery again !! FANTASTIC products !!"
4,This gun is pretty good,i just got mine today and it is pretty good. people say its garbage but its pretty nice. its not very powerful but what do you expect 4 $20. its good for beginners and laying down some cover fire. this is a very good buy!
4,great begginer gun,this is a great airsoft gun for the price. it is accurate and powerful. it hurts toi would recomend this gun for begginers
3,Doesn't compare to a live show,"Well, first off, it is worth buying. I gave it three stars only because it lacked some strong jams. Rollover and Joyful Sound are great. And all the songs are strong studio tracks. The album is worth buying for it is a good string cheese album. However, it doesn't even come close to a live bootleg. If you are a first time String Cheese listener, I don't suggest you buy this album to start with. Try the live album, however if you listen to Cheese alot it does make a nice addition to the collection."
5,Works great,I used this in my pond and it float even when filled to the top with planting medium. The fabric it is made from has held up well and has not deteriorated.
2,Quick and the Dead,"Product arrived quickly buuuuut, it's more like a heavy shirt than a ""Sweatshirt"". Quality is poor for the price."
2,Callas' collection - La Vestale,"I agree with the previous comment that the quality of this recording is extremely poor. It is a pity, since the interpretation would be very good, as far as one can tell."
4,"good, but not superb","The other reviews have said pretty much all I have to say about this album. Reich is a fantastic composer, and has such wonderful ingenuity and technique that he can't help but write good music (or so it seems). That being said, ""You Are"" is not one of his most creative works. I also agree that it needs to be slimmed down in the number of performers so that it doesn't sound so cloudy. ""Cello Counterpoint,"" however, is very good. My favorite of the counterpoint series is ""Electric-"", but ""cello-"" is a very high quality composition, and I enjoyed it a great deal.Basically, this is very very good music, it is just not the best or most interesting work by this composer. So I give it four stars; anyone who hasn't heard Reich before, this is good music, Reich fans, this is nothing to rush to buy."
4,Yay for TFTC! ..british?,"I really love the Tales from the Crypt! HUGE FAN! That's why I was disappointed to find all the last tales in London or wherever. I mean, I love the accent and all, but that was too much! Plus, TFTC is American based.. why did they film the last season on England?Still loved most of the tales though.. and the last episode was kinda unexpected/funny."
1,Thank you Warner!,"Yes, thank you Warner. There was French subtitles on season 1,2,3,4,5 and no more on season 6 and 7 to complete my collection... thank you..."
1,Rubbish,Save your money and don't buy this drivel. The only positive thing I can say is thankfully I did not pay full price.Anyone who has been in the restaurant business knows these tricks and the writing is juvenile.Why can't you give 0 stars? (or negaitve)
1,outdated,"outdatedeveryone pays with credit cards, so about 95% of the book is uselessVery strange and random drug referencesSounds like these guys were in their hayday in 1985, but now are just aging drug addict thieves.Justify it anyway you want, a thief is a thiefIm sorry i bought itsooooooooooo 1985"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the DVD because I remember liking the show so much when I was a kid. I guess we get spoiled through the years and forget about the ""rabbit ears"" and fine tuning it took just get a picture in. The quality of the reception was terrible and even though a couple stories were good, I only watched it once. The first story in particular was just plain creepy."
2,a few good concepts poorly delivered,"The concept of changing the sales approach to focus only on the customers that are ready to buy now is excellent. The qualification process can certainly improve a lot, and this book gives several radical ideas about how to do it.Unfortunately, the way these ideas are presented -- primarily through conversations between a new salesman and his co-workers and customers -- doesn't do justice to them. Most of the dialogues are artificial and lack credibility, and they detract from the main points.There are also many factors in a sales process that are not considered (for example, the approach that is necessary to use in complex sales situations in order to sell to various levels and roles within an organization).This book could have been better written in a similar fashion to the ""One-minute Manager"": it would have been shorter, crisper, and easier to understand."
3,OOPS,"Interesting scenario since bombs have been ""temporarily"" lost due to accidents of one sort or another. One large error however, plutonium is manufactured not mined. Uranium is mined, plutonium is produced from uranium in purpose designed reactors. Otherwise a good yarn."
2,poor plot,"Either a book grabs me or it doesn't and this one definitely didn't. Too many characters to keep up with, too much digression into nonpertinent informationand a plot that wandered aimlessly most of the book."
5,If you want to read the finest book about 'Nam heli pilots....,"...this is THE one!Mason takes you from his training days in Texas, to the jungles of Nam. He learns the tricks of the trade used by the good heli pilots to get in and out of 'hot LZ's', plus makes up a few along the way.An honest book, with descriptions of the war, the people, and the struggles, which make it easy to be drawn into the story.A great read, I recommend it to all my mates that love helicopters as much as I do."
2,Not much of a war story....,"The early part of this book was informative on how the hueys flew and what you had to know to fly them. Some of the early narrative covers the authors clearly courageous action in the Ia Drang battle at LZ X-ray...although poorly compared to Hal Moore's classic. From there it is downhill and soon degenerates into a lurid tale of hookers and booze and shenanigans. Sorry, couldn't finish it. Thanks to the author for his service...in a later part of the war I was one of the grunts in the back of the Huey. Still have a ringing in the ear from the door gunner's muzzle blast on a combat assault with the 101st Airborne."
1,Achieve! Phonics for Grade 1-3 or Pre Kindergarden??,We recently bought the software. My daughter is in Grade 2. I figured since it says grades 1 to 3 it should be somewhat challenging. Like the previous reviewers wrote it's a waste of time for seven year olds. Great if your kid is three or four.I wasted my money on this one. Shame on you Broderbund! If you're going to write software for three year olds write it on the box.
4,Eye Opening Read,"Black Sexual Politics is a very insightful book. I suggest it for anyone that is interested in understanding the dynamics of race,sex and politics. You'll look at racism in film and television in a whole new light."
1,"This vacuum is dangerous.Top heavy,topples.","Having sustained two injuries using this vacuum I felt I should write and warn people with small kids or animals.The vacuum is top heavy and topples over when using the hose attachment. That's a lot of weight to fall down on a small child.It could quite easily topple over and dent a cabinet or appliance.Please, please consider this design flaw before purchasing. A child is going to get killed one day.I emailed Hoover and received a response..""Thanks, Sorry for your injury. Passed on your email"" That's the last I heard. I only pray they aren't selling them anymore.I feel better getting this off my chest and hopefully have saved somebody from injury, or worse.Pay heed."
3,GREAT show; NO argument there!!!,"FANTASTIC show; 1 of my favs from the 70s... HOWEVER, the quality of transfer is TERRIBLE & I'M USUALLY NOT THAT PICKY BUT COME ON!!! This has been like this for what???... the past 2 seasons released??? Where did they get the source transfers from??? Someone's old Beta tapes??? The show deserves ALOT better treatment than it has been given; these episodes should have been ""cleaned up"" or ""mastered"" BEFORE being released! Aside from that... a fantastic season with great effects (explosions, blow-ups, etc.). Let's just hope that the final 2 seasons get BETTER treatment..."
4,Emergency Season Five,"I have not yet watched all of the episodes but I did notice a quality issue on one of the episodes I did watch. While I can certainly appreciate that this dvd collection was created from a TV show that aired in the 70's, my expectation was for clear and clean footage. In the episode of The Nuisance, at the end of the show there were some intermittent rolling lines through the picture (like TV interference). As long as this was only at the end of the episode and was not through the whole show, I can live with it. I cannot comment yet on the other episodes since I have not yet watched them. As of right now, the few lines of interference would not be enough to prevent me from purchasing this DVD set but it is enough to take away a star."
3,Remixes... not my favorite!,"I love Luis FOnsi's work, but whoever came with the idea of making a Remixes Cd ..was wrong! I couln't imagine the beautiful ballad ""Imaginame sin ti"" in a club! If you are looking for a good release by this singer, check out Abrazar la vida and his latest Paso a Paso."
2,fade to black.......,"what was once a great band with promise has evolved to show unoriginal progress. the songs all sound the same(excluding the acoustic piece. It seems that they music hopes to acheive the swedish sound, at which i feel they fail. I would give the release 1 stars except I thought the vocal work was quite superb, and shined apart from the band. Its very interesting to see how this band has evolved since their demo, and the misanthrope. The band lost the originality in trying to become more ""METAL""."
5,Pure awesomeness,"Even though the first of Darkest Hour's albums is early in their development (obviously) it does not leave you wanting anything. Awesome listen, great buy!"
4,Good album but not the best...,"If you know any of the other Triumph albums you should check this one out. It's from the late 70's era of a band who became somewhat popular on the 80's. The songs are very good like the radio friendly and Top 40 hit ""Hold On"" which is one of the best. Also the ballad ""Just A Game"" is very poignant and straight to the point. There also a Zeppelinesque style song in ""American Girls"", and there's the powerful guitar on ""Lay it On the Line"".""Just a Game"" is a good album, but if you want a more faithful approach to this band I recommend ""Allied Forces"" or ""The Sport of Kings"" which are better albums since are from a more mature band."
2,Not Joseph Kuo's best,"I love Joseph Kuo films. This didn't feel like one. It's kinda like a swordsplay / heroic bloodshed / drama with bad fight choreography. ""King of Kings"" with the same cast is a little better, but not much. Pass"
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I bought this book based on the description ""lavish pictorial biography"". It has only 15 pictures in it. I'm returning it and shopping for a different book with more pictures."
5,A Must Have!,"This book is absolutely brilliant. I have read it in its entirty once and then skimmed it a second time. The personal annecdotes are very insightful, interesting and helpful while the authors' writing style is smooth and intelligent. This is a great practical guide for anyone who would like to learn about investing in this manner or anyone seeking funding for their own firm. As an experienced entrepreneur and investor, I have highly recommended this indispensible book to my colleagues. I would only expect them to do the same. This is undoubtedly one of the best collections of information on angel investing and venture capitalism that I have ever seen."
4,I bought this to Network my Tivo,"And network my Tivo I did. It worked right out the box without any problems at all - Tivo recognized it immediately.Would have got 5 stars, but I do feel that the price point for this ""brand"" device is excessive now that USB is a very mature technology.Incidentally, I bought a $6 + $2 shipping non-branded device from ebay which works perfectly with a colleague's Tivo."
2,Dissappointed,"I was highly dissappointed when I heard this cd. I purchased this cd when John Legend was considered ""hot"" at the time. He didn't put much into this cd, it was as if his lable just ""put together"" something for the holiday season, I've only listened to it once or twice during the holidays."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"This CD is ""Straight off tha Cross"". I did not know what to expect when I bought it. I just wanted to add wemon rappers to my Christian music selection - which I feel is hard to come by :o).I have to say I was/am pleasantly surprised by what I heard. It is GREAT. If you want a cd that is full of ""crunk"" christian rap music this is the Cd for you. My favorites are:BounceY U Hatin On MePosse SongGod Bless the ChildSave MeOh heck, who am I foolin, I can put this Cd in and let it play all the way through without skippin songs - which is rare to find....I rank this with Cross Movement's music. So if you like them, you will love this CdOne Luv, One Jesus Christ, One God, One Way"
1,"Caution! Epson, good at first - then look out!","I'm looking for a printer to replace my Epson C82 which will not print after only 2 years and less than 2 packages of paper.The one thing I find consistant here is that out of the box, they seem great! It's just that the honeymoon ends much too early. I used my HP540 for over 8 years. I replaced it when I had to feed the paper in one sheet at a time, but I still consider that less of a problem than having paper come out completely blank!Read all the reviews before you buy. Will it still work after the warrenty has expired?"
1,LEMON CITY!,I bought it and had it for a week and had to return it. It was a mess. I had a horrible time installing it and had to remove all other printers and then re-install. It used a tremendous amount of ink I went through 2 black cartridges in only a week...at 17.99 a pop this was not good. Then it began to work on an off. I would have to power off the computer to get it to work but then only for a few sheets.It is very huge and bulky. Thee is a creen to view information but you have to stand to read it. The on and off button wouldn't always work either I am so happy to be rid of it
3,Catchy Mellow Joint.reminds of 1995 Mariah,"this is a Catchy Joint by Mariah though it reminds of Her Stuff during 1995.Her voice sounds cool.I dig how She quotes Bobby Womack's ""If you think your Lonely now""&Babyface's Former Band the Deele on 'Two Occasions"". in fact 'We Belong Together"" reminds me of a Babyface type of slow Jam."
3,not as described,This item was not as listed. Says it was stamped cross stitch and is a counted cross stitch design.It was bought for my mother that cannot do the counted anymore.
5,Great Seller!,tried to leave feedback but couldn't get to it. dictionary is just what we needed. seller provided great price & quick delivery. thank you!
4,Heads up DMB fans,"This album is an unexpected proof of the quality and durability of DMB songs. It is amazing to hear how the unique mood and feeling of DMB is fully compatible with bluegrass.The production of the album is crisp and harmonious (in the spirit of DMB), and the instrumentation is beatiful.This is my first and last country album. And I love it!"
3,Just what I was looking for!,I enjoy listening to the music of the Dave Matthews Band in any form. The melodies are just as beautiful done this way. The perfect accompaniment for your Dave Matthews collection.
4,Read the words,"Robin Griffith-Jones could have used fireworks, pictures or 101 other tricks to demonstrate Paul's creativity. But instead he does it with words. His textual analysis, especially in the second half of the book, proves that Paul was not just brilliant but also engaging. It is the analysis that stands out in a book of many other qualities. Paul's creativity emerges through Robin's close study of what Paul actually said, of the words he used to confront his audience. Conveyed sympathetically, Robin gives a highly convincing account of the creative genius."
5,Tells the truth on the Bible's stand against homosexuality,The author Jones points out how the book of Romans completely knocks as sinful homosexual practices in both men and women. A winner of a book!
1,What's on it?,I need descriptions of what selections are included in this Secret Garden recording. Won't buy if the contents are not printed somewhere...
5,greatest book ever,i loved how he used Bobby's diary to show first person and yet he used third person when talking about courtney and mark i also loved the great detail in all the things he talked about it gave me a basic picture for everything and the travelers are so misterious i can't wait to read the next book and i would recommend this book to any1 with a little bit of imagination in them absolutely marvolous!...
3,Good Book,My 10 year old grandson really enjoyed this book. He was little put off by some of the language.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,Wow! The book is not overly detailed and descriptive like the boring Harry Potter books. It has an excellent background story. You think something will happen to change the outcome of the story but there is a new twist added completely making things vise versa. Well thought out and has a great ending. What makes it even better is when you finish this fantasic book you have 4 more books that just came out to add to the suspense! The enemy is the most vile of enemies (Saint Dane) and makes your heart go into over time. It says that it is a good book to read while you wait for the next Harry Potter book to come out. Harry Potter is the dullest book compared to this. Very suspenseful and has a great story line. And 5 more books left to come making a great series with 10 books!
3,Not Bad,"I was hoping for that pure reading enjoyment that I got from reading Harry Potter, so my disappointment is my own fault.It was good; it was also a strange writing style. I enjoyed it, I read it fast, and still not sure if I will read book 2.Not sure what else to say......it was ""Not Bad"""
4,just the door to the cave,Amazing wonderful thilling. Just a few appropiate words to describe Pendragon. The way Mr. McHale introduces the characters makes them seem more like aspiring friends not just fictional people created by a writer. Bobby acts just the way a real person would act being plucked from his friends and tossed into an unknown battle. He gives a break from the 2d characters that automatically accept their role with no visible path to the change of become an abled hero. This hewlps make the book more personal as we lean back and think that truthfully ths is how we act given the same situation. In short suspense and action mixed with a little comedy and a lot of suprise make this book a perfect read.
1,Poor writing and lackluster storytelling,"It is extremely rare that I put a book down and never intend to go back. I had high hopes for this book, but I was so disappointed after reading so many great reviews and hearing about how good it was.It starts out strong, but by about page 75 I was bored with the generic fantasy caricatures (not actual characters) and the generic fantasy setting. The last straw was a series of atrociously written pages wherein the author explains a plot point, and then explains it again, and then explains that he's explaining it. Give tween readers a little more credit. Good writing is good writing, no matter the age of the target audience, and this is not good writing."
4,"D.J., buy a dictionary, not just a Thesaurus!","Okay, I must say this.... This is a really good book. Not the best I've ever read, but good. HOWEVER, as a dictionary addict, I must say that, even on a planet with three suns, Equinox has nothing to do with noon, 'revolt', 'rebellion', and 'revolution' are not true synonims and cannot be used as such, and there was farrrrrrrrrrr too much product placement! Milkyway bars? L.L. Bean? Give us a break! Um, Equinox litterally means 'equal night', and refurs to the tine twice a year when the night and day are exactly the same length. It cannot be used as a synonim for noon, ever! Also, must he give ideotic names to dangerouse things? I mean, really, but reallly, QUIGS? how is that supposed to inspire fear in Anyone!?I will shut up now. It is a very good book, if you can ignor those little problems..... Go ahead, read it. I know I'm still going to read it again....."
4,Good Stove,"This stove is large and served me well after I purchased it. I was able to fit a 12"" Lodge cast iron skillet on it without issue. You might be able to fit an even larger pot on it.If I could change anything? 1. Make the burner diameter slight larger. I had a real hot-spot in the center of my pot (even using cast iron). 2. The regulator is machined aluminum and I fear cross-threading it every time I screw it onto a propane bottle. 3. The heat shield on the underside of the stove is pretty sharp. Careful while handling it. 4. No easy ability to simmer with this stove. It pretty much runs at a medium or high setting."
5,Perfect size,Perfect size for my purpose. Use it on the boat in the summer and can be an emergency stove at home in the winter. A deep skillet fits perfectly in the holders. Great for using the pressure cooker at both places too. The flame is controllable for the necessary instant regulation of heat for pressure cooking. Takes up much less area than a dual burner camp stove where space is at a premium.
3,"General Administration Info, not too in-depth.","I felt it needed to cover File/Directory security more. It doesn't give examples on specific security issues. Overall, it was more like a quick reference guide. I did like it though."
4,"Derivative, perhaps? Doesn't lessen the quality","The other reviewer was somewhat scornful of this book as ""derivative"" of Heyer's ""Regency Buck."" Perhaps there are plot points similar in both cases (and I note that they are plot points shared by quite a few other Regencies, including other Heyer books). But that shouldn't diminish the depth of characterization that is common in Richardson's books. While there is definitely an interesting plot in ""GG,"" the book concentrates on the development of the relationship between the two characters. The growth of friendship and love in the relationship is well-paced and believable, and the secondary characters are delightful.C'mon, let's face it -- Heyer is the best of the best. But that doesn't mean that other authors out there aren't contributing lively, interesting stories with well-developed characters. Richardson is definitely one of those authors."
2,Great atmosphere!,Unfortunately I wasn't really keen on this title. I found the time setting the most interesting factor. The only other title I have read by Mr. Price is The Alamut Ambush & this was average fare. The 44 Vintage unfortunately was not a good one. Below average for it's type.
5,Great price; Great flask,"I love the 6oz size, it fits in any pocket for easy concealment. Sure you get more in an 8 or 9oz flask but those extra ounces make it uncomfortable to carry without sticking out of your pocket or being a large flask shaped bulge, unless of course you have a jacket pocket.There isn't much to say about these things. They are small, made of metal, hold liquid successfully and enable you to be an alcoholic on the go."
1,No good.,"The title of this product originally said 6, 6oz flasks and then in fine print on my receipt only ended up sending me 5 flasks (now fixed). The flasks they sent me were scratched and dented and were not able to be engraved because of their poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,A Super Bargain,"I purchased this simply as a means to have an easier means to connect my iPod to the stereo (easier than the mini-stereo jack). It does this, of course. As a bonus, it also has a perfectly serviceable remote. The remote is not a lot of use if you're scrolling through hundreds of artist or album names as it doesn't approach the speed of moving with the click-wheel but, the for on/off, pause/play, it is terrific. The capability to play video out to the TV or make menu selections via TV isn't really important to me but, I've played with them and they work fine.Word of note: I had to do a little online research to discover a slight fault in the product. If you turn the volume down to far on the unit itself, you may experience signal distortion. If you keep the volume up on the TuneCenter, and use the volume on your amplifier, the sound is fine (though, I'm no audiophile).Overall - price/features/function - bargain!"
3,Great potential,"One of the main reasons I chose this item was for the internet radio capability. It works pretty well, but the navigation of radio stations is horrible. You have to scroll thru a single list, no categorization, and no saving of favorites. You pretty much have to go thru the entire list each time you want to choose a station (using up your remote control battery in the process). The unit occasionally locks up (continues playing, but you can't use the controls), and you have to turn it off or disconnect the power. If the unit was upgraded with station categories and ability to save favorites, I'd give it 5 stars. iPod works fine with this unit."
2,The dock works - sort of,"I bought this instead of a Denon link for my Denon receiver. It works, but now I wish I had bought a real Denon link instead. The problems are as follows: output is strictly analog, the remote is slow, the menu interface doesn't allow rapid movement through a list of songs, the composite video output is low resolution (of course), and has a vertical orange line on the left side of the display.I control the unit with a Logitech Harmony programmable remote, and that fixed the range issues with the original remote, however, the device reacts slowly to button presses. It seems that the least frustrating way to use the unit is to place it in shuffle mode and let it go.The bottom line, is that this unit really doesn't provide more functionality than the Apple dock."
3,Who does this book serve?,"Robin Griffith-Jones is a Christian minister. Let that be your guide when considering this book. I read The Four Witnesses, and it is an exquisitely fine piece of historical and theological writing. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. This book, as much as it might like to convince you prior to your purchase that it is a fair and balanced look at the facts of The Da Vinci Code, is anything but. It presents nothing that has not already been hashed and re-hashed by those Christians who oppose the plotlines of Dan Brown's book, so don't pick up this book thinking otherwise. Is the central plotline of Dan Brown's novel (novel is defined as a work of fiction, by the way) true? Who knows? Who cares? It's a novel. Isn't it time to let this go and move on? The Christian Church has survived 2,000 years of every conceivable theological and philosophical attack, and for some strange reason it is still here. I doubt this novel will do much to change that."
2,Very Disapointed,I was very disappointed after receiving this. It only like half of the concert and leaves out most of the killer songs that appear on the album. Quality was good enough but I just do not understand why they left out half the songs.
1,Worst DVD I've ever seen,"I'm surprised to see so many favorable comments on this insipid DVD. I thought it was a total waste of my money, 17 minutes of sheer stupidity (that's right, a 17-minute movie for the price of a full-length feature). There's nothing clever about this so-called parody, and barely anything that's even halfway funny. A Star Trek parody is a wonderful idea, but this idea fails miserably in its execution.Don't waste your money on this DVD."
2,Old Pop tarts sent to my house,"My husband loves these pop tarts only and I thought by ordering them on line I would receive a fresh batch, but the boxes I received were 8 months older than the ones I had already bought for my children at the store. He is still eating them but I was very dissapointed to suprise him with something so old."
2,minimal help,"i tried this compared to the motorola signal boost product, this was a minimal help with comcast cable. spend the extra money and get the motorola here on amazon..."
2,Unsatisfying Addition to the Genre (or Ow My Arm Hurts),"Knowing what will happen never lessens the fun when a protagonist is out to even a score. In fact, that's what makes these kind of films so enjoyable. But this well-crafted and smartly cast thriller never amounts to much. It is so reserved in delivering its payoff that one of the victims is actually left with an achy arm. That's the revenge! Gotcha - your arm hurts! I won't ruin the fate of the principal character, but the delivery of her comeuppance is also wanting. While I'm not a fan of our lack of subtleness here in the States - a remake would probably have Melanie running around with a machete - this thriller could have been greatly improved with a racier denouement. Instead the film walks to a whimper."
2,The script never really sells the story,"Spoiler warning: Why this young lady would hold such a vendetta, including promoting physical damage of a youth, over a slight at a piano competition is proposition that outstretches credulity. The story has a decent structure, and the choreography of a thriller, but virtually a complete absense of tension and suspense. Furthermore, the characters are all cold and the audience cannot embrace sympathy. Thumbs down."
2,Very esoteric,"You really have to be a language weenie to care about many of these. If you're looking to become a better programmer, or simply to be entertained, this probably isn't the right book."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this book. It tries to cover far too much ground in too little space. Not only is the book not a ""people's history of Iraq"" it is not even really a history of the Iraqi Communist Party.This is definitely not the first book anyone should read about Iraq or the Iraqi left. The first thing to read is Tariq Ali's Bush in Babylon. Reading this book first will only confuse you. If you read Ali's work and want more, read Hannah Batatu's classic the Old Social Classes and the Revolutionary Movements in Iraq, a 1,300 page monster filled with first hand accounts by Communists and Ba'athists, as well as tons of statistics and other empirical data."
4,Worth a shot,I just finished reading this book. It may not be for everyone but speaks very well to my situation. I live in Japan and am thinking about marrying a Japanese natioonal. This book brought our some points which we need to consider. The points were also backed up with real stories. He is reading parts of the book now and finds it very interesting to see Japan through the eyes of an American woman.
5,"Handy, light and sturdy",No complaints what so ever. It locks into place unlike cheap versions and feels very sturdy. We bought it to have the kids use to get in and out of the minivan but it has ended up in the house because the adults keep needing it. Very light weight and easy to fold and store.
5,The best step you can buy,"Being in the medical field, I have purchased many steps over the years for reaching patient charts. Stationary steps are fine, the ones that lock down when you step on them, a little unstable, and the folding ones (up until now) just plan scary.This step folds out to an incredibly stable surface where even a larger person (like me) can step and feel secure. The design allows it to be steady on any floor; wood, carpet, tile. And when done, a one-hand pick-up and fold-up compresses to a couple inches that can be slipped between bookshelves, next to the fridge, or behind a door. I now have 6 including one for outside, one in my car, and one in the garage. They are just too handy not to have nearby; a perfect solution for compulsive organizes who have bins on shelves and need to lift them up and down while feeling steady."
2,Serves its purpose but not exactly what I wanted,"I guess there is nothing wrong with the step stool, just must smaller than I pictured it, but I do use it from time to time, but doesn't work for what I initially wanted it for."
4,An excellent start until you can find and afford the imports,"If you've scoured the internet and somehow bought all their cd's then you already own all the songs here (the only reason for 4 stars and not 5). If you're just getting around to them and don't want to spring for the cost of an import, then this is a great intro that will keep you satisfied for a while. Amazing talent (especially Dregen their lead guitarist) and great variety of high energy rock. If these guys were from the US they'd be headlining their own tour instead of just opening for Social Distortion"
1,Changed the formula,"I used the 241239 Satin Enamel a couple years ago, and loved it for my outdoor furniture. I just tried it again for some additional furniture, and they've apparently changed their formula. The current stuff is JUNK. It's thin and runny, takes multiple coats to cover, and dries to a semi-gloss rather than satin. The old stuff came in a can with a purple table on the front (as shown on the site). the new can has a picture of a brown wood bench. Same part number, but very different contents. I wrote to the company to complain but no response. Don't buy this trash!"
3,Good read,"The author did a wonderful job of explaining the details focusing on the plot without giving away too much information or having it overwhelm the reader. There is enough mystery in the story to keep one interested and attuned to what was going on.The story had way too may clichés in the book, it was like an onslaught. This strove to make the characters more one dimensional than they should have been and not having unique and individual personalities coming through.Note: I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."
2,Boring!!!,I have to say that I read a few of the authors books in the past and found them thoroughly enjoyable. But in this case I cant believe the book got so highly rated. I dont think I have ever skipped so many pages in my life. The first half of the book was so slow and nothing happened. The main characters didnt even meet til halfway in which would be fine if the book found an interesting way to fill the pages which is didnt. After that it got a little better but although the characters were likeable enough i found nothing deep was ever developed. i was just left with a feeling of who cares. Hopefully if I do ever read another book by the author it will be a little more like the other two I have read and less like this one.
5,SON'S FAVORITE TOY!,"Oh my goodness! It's so hard to find something for my son that he can play with since he's only 3 months and it's hard for him to even hold things. He tends to be happier if he keeps his hands busy (characteristic of a Scorpio [late October to late November]), so up to now all I can find for him are skinny rattles. We bought him this about three weeks ago and I put it on his carseat and HE LOVES IT!!! I cannot give a rave enough review. When he wakes up, instead of crying he sits there and stares at it. He loves to hold the rings to give him something to do with his hands. He also has the option to shake it so he can hear the rattle, and he likes to grab his wings and make them crinkle. I LOVE THIS TOY, AND MY SON DOES, TOO! Imagine how much more he'll love it as he gets older and can grab all of the things hanging from Buzz's legs, and even carry it around!"
4,Large and dumb,"Product is very colorful. But, because it is larger than most toys that hang from gyms or car seat handles it dangles oddly. This is mostly becaust (as you see from picture) hook is on one of the legs instead of the middle of the body. So, I have yet to find a place to dangle it where it wasn't laying in my childs lap or in his face. Also, compared to the other Lamaza toys like this, it has less features (noise, crinkle, and activites that entertain). You would be much better of with the giraffe or peacock."
2,"mush, not fillets","I ordered these on the basis of the description ""flat fillets."" Unfortunately, the description would be more accurate if it said ""anchovy mush."" I am not pleased. The flavor is OK."
2,NOT UNIVERSAL,"these mud flaps do not fit a 1999 toyota tacoma, unfortunately. they're nice but worthless for me because they did not work and I didn't return them in time. Oh well.."
1,i fear for my life,"i found this book offensive for the follwing reasons:1) after miss applebaum's unfortunate ... in a purely inconceivable way. the young children, no older than many who read the book, ....well... that's basically it, but that is extremely disturbing! i couldn't believe what i was *reading*. it was the scariest thing i have ever in my life come across!!!! i was expecting a good, wholesome family book, but now i am constantly haunted ....steer clear! and i once thought that return to oz was creepy. this book is more terrifying than veggie tales."
3,Decent overview of his work,This DVD is certainly very enjoyable. I wish it had more of Phil's Sinatra and Donahue impersonations however. Definitely a buy for any Phil Hartman fan.
5,Phil Hartman was a genius!,"Entertaining, funny and wonderful! I think we all miss Phil Hartman and his wonderful art and comedy. This is a delightful collection which will make you laugh out loud."
2,DVD is a cut up mess,"I was looking forward to the DVD.Man, a let down.DVD starts out with some classic funny bit The Frank Sinatra with Sting as Billy Idol, Bill Clinton & the fast food. Still very funny today.But, then it went into a cut up mess. Multiple cut up sketches.Then, the rest of the sketches THAT WERE COMPLETE were not best of sketches.Any SNL or fan of the late Phil will be disappointed in this DVD."
2,Fair DVD,"Fair DVD by Phil Hartman. Phil hartman was often the straight guy on SNL and was pretty underrated. This collection of the ""best"" includes many funny skits, but not all of the best ones. It also seems that very little attention went into deciding which skit should follow other ones, etc."
1,Deranged Fundamentalism,"Glenn goytil's ""Book"" was a collection of mad apocalyptic rantings wrapped in a ""feel-good"" new age message. Certainly, Glen Goytil has failed in his promise to provide a solution to the coming ""economic and environmental disaster"" of the coming years. In short, ""The Spiritual"" is a virtually incoherent and rather frightening look into the mind of a former forest ranger. Beware."
1,Do NOT buy it,"Why waste your money? This disc is terrible. Unless you have a morbid curiosity about Jaco's decline, then there's no reason to buy it. How many times do you want to hear him play the Barbary Coast lick? He repeats himself, scuffs up, his solos are tired and you've heard them all before anyways (and played so much better when he was in his prime). Jaco is a hollow version of his once amazing self--and someone was there to record it and then to sell it. How lovely. It's just sad to compare Teen Town from 8:30 to this one. Remember the beautiful Jaco and don't buy this disc."
5,So glad to see it back!!,"As so many others have said, I also bought this book in a used book store in the mid 80's. I loaned it to a friend and never saw it again. I tried to buy another copy, but discovered it was out of print. I'm so thrilled to see it back. This is a must read for any girl ""coming of age""!"
3,fun and practical,"It is a sounding, simple book, but the suggestions are practical. it seems to be ""old-fashioned"", but in this complicated world, when we all are over-emphasizing internal psychological problems, ""behavior-ist"" is ignored.This book reminds us to pick ""them"" up again and take a look at these simple but yet working principles of human behavior and relationship."
3,Not a bad film,"I originally saw this movie in 1983 when it came out and was mildly amused. By far the best character in this one was Herbert Lom as ""Dreyfus"". Ted Wass' character was not that bad, it was just the script. When I bought this reissued DVD, I was disappointed that there were no extras to speak of (theatrical trailer) but no filler inside the box either."
2,Very few spankings in this novel about adult spanking.,"This novel was disappointing, as it didn't live up to its attention-grabbing summary and topic. Although the book has a great deal of sex with various partners and fantasies about being spanked throughout its contents, the first spanking does not occur until page 84. Then the next is at least 15 pages later. I ordered this book because I thought it was a novel about adult spankings. I didn't want a novel about a woman wishing someone would spank her and then occasionally it happens. Plus there are hundred's of fiction books detailing sex and sexual encounters, if that is what I was looking for, this book would not have been among my choices. ""Brat"" is disappointing and not fully worth the money, better to get this paperback in the library or a used book store. Thank you."
1,Don't buy this speakerwire,This speaker wire does not have a marked wire.....so you can't tell which is the side you want to make positive or negative when hooking up speakers.....sad Will probably throw the wire away can't use it
2,Buy at your Local Lowes store,"After checking the price and shipping cost of this product on amazon, I decided to pay a visit to my local Lowes store. Here is what I found out:Amazon: $16.77+$11 for standard shipping (just one above the super slow shipping)Lowes: $20 + 1.50 tax."
4,Good stuff,Works like it should - Great quality sheathing and don't have any noticeable loss of audio quality using this wire.
3,Decent speaker wire,"The wire worked fine with my Onkyo HTIB. But the spool I got didn't have any way of telling which wire was ground. Both wires were copper, unlike the picture. But I just wrapped some electrical tape around the wire on each end I was using for ground."
5,The goddess Erin Gray,"Erin Gray, in her tight spandex outfits, is the reason to watch the late 70s Buck Rogers. Kudos to her costume designers!"
5,Great parts to connect with the original train set.,"These are great to snap together with the other parts of the track to make it bigger and better, more flexibility."
3,almost 60 per cent mates,"Though i would say this is not a bad book, of the 132 pages with six problems each nearly 60 per cent problems are mates. mate in one to a maximum mate in 3 the number of moves required or other clue mentioned on every page. Of the few pages I scanned some had printing errors, one problem had two white kings, another problem hard two black dark squared bishops both printing errors.. Otherwise the quality of the book binding is relatively good. Personally I would prefer John Nunn's book Learn chess tactics.Peter Carvalho"
2,Major disappointment,The only good thing about this album is the wonderful cover. There are too many ideas and styles here and none of them are mature enough to be considered for an album. This sounds like random selected Anathema songs that did not make it on to previous albums. This cd is boring just like A fine day to exit was. If they listened to it Beavis would probably turn to Butthead and say hey you fell asleep dude. Sounds a lot like Radiohead in many places. Progress and innovation is good but can't it please be in the direction of Judgement? Even if you are a hardcore fan this album will still disappoint you.
3,Not a Hater but. . .,"A well written tragedy, Americanized to death.Though well written and flowing in parts, the author failed me on only a few levels: he did not properly introduce the sisters of the Piccinelli family and a few characters seemed entirely unnecessary.The main character problem in the book I found to be the remoteness of Maddalena, our hero's love. Maddalena's remoteness, almost to the point of coldness, made her difficult to sympathize with, especially when she was faced with dilemmas of the heart.I felt that Vito's main act of love for Magdalena was all but over looked and the setting of young love blossoming under the guise of war is a bit stale.Other then the Americanized ending to a perfectly good tragedy and dialogue that in parts became a little 'iffy' Castellani, produced a book well above what would be expected for a first time novelist and I will most certainly look forward to reading more of his work."
3,Mixed feelings,I really enjoyed the love story that was portrayed in this book and how innocent it was. The story also gave an excellent detailed perspective on war in European families. However I felt that the end of this book just left a sour taste in my mouth and I am not sure I want to read the second one. I don't see how the second book will have a cheery feeling when the main character is miserable.
3,Fun for a moment.,"I bought this for my daughter a while back, and she was entertained for a short while. She'd giggle when I squeaked the legs, but it didn't last long. Also, one of the legs on mine was broken and made a really lame quiet sound. Other than me initially showing it to her, she had no interest in this toy. It just sat in the corner and was never played with."
5,Great toy,"It's great, cute and well designed. My grandson loves it. Highly recommend for musical notes in feet."
5,LOVE THIS,We bought this product for a 7 month old. She loves it! We had trouble giving it up because it is so much fun to play with!! We have registered for one for our little guy on the way!
3,Warm but shedding is a problem,"These are not the best sheets but they do keep you warm. Shedding is a problem and they probably want last more than 2-3 seasons. A decent deal for the price i paid, about 7.00 a set"
1,Sheets are thin and of poor quality,"I purchased two sets of sheets and washed them in delicate cycle and also dried them with low heat. They don't fit my mattress and on top of that, the threads started to fray right away because they're so thin. I've decided not to use them. Instead, I'm going to donate them and purchase another brand of sheets for myself."
5,We love our comfy and cozy sheets!,Each washing they get softer and softer. Haven't had any problems with them. We love them and even use them in the summer as well because they are so comfortable. Thanks!
3,affordable flannel sheets,"The flannel sheets are OK for the price. When you wash/dry them, it comes out very wrinkled and attracts a lot of lint."
1,Very Poor Fabric Choice-Amazon Return Policy Perfect!,"I ordered 5 sets of these sheets to give to my family members for Christmas Eve presents and I could not give them. They are very poor fabric quality, made in Pakistan, and terrible labeling. I couldn't even detect from the outer package what size they were. Do not order Pike Street Flannel Sheets.AMAZON.COM was wonderful. They did not charge me to return these sheets. Very kind and very simple to do."
1,Is Zero Stars an option???,"Because if it was, that's what I would give these sheets. I ordered these on sale for $9.99. Yeah...I know. I should've known at that price. Ordered Queen Size sheets and washed them once before attempting to use them. I washed them in cold water using the delicate cycle. And I tumble dried them on low. Alas...the sheets don't fit our Queen Size bed. What's up with that? We tried and tried...but the fitted sheet won't fit (no pun intended). Steer clear of these sheets. You get what you pay for!! Unfortunately, my wife threw away the original packaging, so I'll probably just have to use these for rags. Amazon shouldn't sell junk like this, no matter how low the price is."
2,"Warm, but you get what you pay for","I bought these for the bargain $15 because I had never owned a set of flannel sheets and wanted to try them out. As stated above, these sheets are warm compared to the Egyptian cotton sheets we usually have on our bed. My husband complained that they were itchy on his skin, but I didn't notice any itchiness. The queen flat sheet was a little narrow, but that may be due to the down mattress topper we have on our queen mattress. After a second washing, I noticed that the flannel has begun to ""pill"". Perhaps a better quality sheet would not pill, but these are okay for this winter season, but I don't know whether we'll be using them next year."
3,Slightly disappointing.,"Following these daring storm chasers as they travel hundreds of miles and discover.....nothing! Most of this video puts you right into the center of a storm chaser's life. True, that the average storm chaser successfully catches a tornado on film only about 10% of the time...but did the video have to cover the other 90%?"
5,Completely Satisfied,"I was looking for a reasonably priced yet good looking Panama style hat. This fits the bill! Light weight,perfect fit and great style. Del Monaco Hatters did a super job of getting the hat to me quickly and safely!"
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"I like the bioscrubber, I'm using this filter in a 55 gal tank for my red eared slider turtle. The tank isn't totally filled, but it's more than half full and it works good. You just have to have filter refills on hand. I tried to clean the filter refill that came with the system, but it didn't work, very nasty, too much gunk. It's worth it."
1,Is it possible to give negative stars?,"This video is propaganda, plain and simple. Anyone associated with its production, as well as those who view it as even somewhat honest and objective, ought to be ashamed of themselves. People such as these need to wake up and realize that the vast majority of cannabis consumers are responsible, otherwise law-abiding citizens who are capable of making perfectly rational decisions about what they put in their bodies, and when.A shameful volume."
5,Seeking out the Lost Kingdom,"A series of five books, engagingly written and complex in depth and scope. Allthough difficult to understand, at first, some of the terminology, the depth and construction makes them a very worthwhile read. ALAS - the publisher printed very few of the series, and only ran a /single/ printing of the fourth book - making it impossible to find. They were published by Tor, which seems to have that habit."
2,Buyer Beware,Manufacturer still has not updated photo. You still receive one with colors instead of numbers on the pressure dial. Hope it works at least. Have not tried yet. Please provide correct photo.
3,good conditioner,"this is a pretty good conditioner, doesn't weigh hair down. The only problem that I have with it, is that it doesn't detangle my damaged hair. Although, I have a problem finding any conditioner that truly detangles my hair. Very nice scent."
2,Not what you might expect,"The seller that I bought this book was great..no problem there. However this was not the book I thought it would be. While lacking in some major areas the book seemed to ""dumb itself down"" for lack of better terms. People that are researching reef aquariums would be much better off if information was dumbed down for them. This causes confusion in general. The book while helpful on some points lacked any real ""meat"" to say the least. If I was going on a point system 1-5 I'd rate it about a 2."
4,Mack mixer,"It's a cool truck, and my son loves it. The only problem I have with it, is that it is not tough enough for a 3 year old. It's all plastic."
3,"Good feel, lousy scroll","The mouse has a good feel to the finger placement, and overall feels pretty comfortable.On the downside, the scroll wheel has major issues, tending to bounce up and down when you're scrolling in one direction, making it almost useless.I picked this device up on the cheap, so I've stuck with it. But unlike the Nostromo gamepads, I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this."
4,Streamlight battery,"I have been searching for a battery for my Streamlight SXL 20 rechargeable flashlight, and this is the perfect replacement. It came nearly fully charged, and has held a charge, with nominal usage, for the two+ months I have had it. This battery is a steal compared to the OEM cell, which usually run about $50. I wouldn't hesitate purchasing this item again.Hitech - 6V Ni-Cd Rechargeable Battery for Maglite Rechargeable Flashlights"
5,I loved it !!!!,This book has helped my imigination expand in many ways. I have just finished reading The merchant of Death and I cant wait to go and buy The lost city of Faar. I hope that D.J. MacHale will continue his his wonderful writing. Also I hope Bobby will keep fighting his war. In other words I wish that more of these books are produced. Keep up the good work D.J. Mac Hale!
5,Finding Faar,"I really loved this book. It really kept you on your toes, and was a perfect sequel to The Merchat of Death. It had unexpected twists and leaves you waiting for the next adventure!"
5,Sure to be a Christmas Tradition and Favorite,I just saw this movie in the theater and loved it. I looked down the row at my family and kids and saw tears in each one of their eyes as they were touched in such a beautiful way. It was not just for children and not just for adults - but for the whole family. This is a Christmas book I grew up hearing and have continued sharing with my children each year and I am so happy to be able to extend that tradition into watching this movie each year. Great job to all involved!
2,Doesn't cite sources reliably,"Alexander Sanger clearly relies on his grandmother's reputation in order to sell his book. Rife with grammatical errors and uncited sources, Sanger constantly calls his own credibility as a competent researcher into question. His ideas ARE interesting, but without telling us where he gets his statistics from, he leaves those good ideas unsupported.I am heartily glad I only paid $1 for this book."
1,margaret sanger must be rolling over in her grave...,"As someone who volunteers at a local women's clinic by escorting patients in to see the doctor of their choice, I find it hard to fathom the idea that I am supposed to reach out and appreciate the viewpoint of those who call me a murderer, call the employees of the clinic murderers, and call the patients murderers (screaming all the while). Reasoning can be done only with the reasonable. To suggest otherwise is simply foolish."
1,Basta!!! Por Favor!!!,"Ruben Rada sigue atravesando un período ""negro"" en su carrera musical. Sus primeros albums de principios de la década de los '70 sentaron las bases de un estilo propio de fusión de jazz, rock y candombe (ritmo afro uruguayo) que le valió el respeto a nivel latinoamericano. Tras su radicación en Buenos Aires, su música decayó en calidad hasta perderse en el anonimato, para volver con una serie de CD's como ""Radeces"", ""Montevideo"" y su mas reciente ""Black"" (con participación de los mas que mediocres Ketama) que lamentablemente muestran que la inspiración se ha perdido hace mucho tiempo.Montevideo es un canto a la mediocridad que él mismo representa."
5,Grandma Arlene,"I've bought 2 sets of the Monsties Hand Puppets because the grandkids love them so. We make up silly stories about them getting into trouble because of their sharp teeth and ""monster ways"" like eating everything in site and accidentally scaring people and popping balloons. I think it helps the little ones get over fears of scary monsters. Lots of fun and laughs!"
4,textbook,"The book arrived quickly and in good shape. Honestly, I haven't opened it yet. I got it for a class."
2,Way to Small,Well this case is beyond small they should call it extra small it would not even fit my .22 semi automatic pistol with a 3 in barrel it might hold a little 2 shot dilenger pistols but nothing bigger than that
1,Way to small to be used with any pistol,"I bought this case thinking it would be at least big enough to hold the Ruger Sr22, but was I wrong. Way wrong in fact. I don't know of any pistol that would fit in this case. It is basically unusable, unless you have a super small handgun."
2,Titilation!,"Only got this out of curiosity and a spike in my testosterone level! Somewhat fun. Poorly acted, lame script but I must admit Edwige Fenech is not hard to look at especially when she is in burlesque mode."
2,Cut Scenes!,"I was looking forward to the arrival of the DVD having only seen this excellent movie as a dark and grainy download from Veoh. Boy, was I disappointed to find that some key scenes have been cut from the DVD! How dare they do that and destroy the integrity of this fine piece of coming of age teen angst!"
4,A bit confusing at times - but so is coming of age!,"Beautiful, touching, and totally understandable by anyone who grew up as a gay boy. It's a little disjointed, but I have a feeling that's intentionally mirroring the mental state of the main character (who is a very beautiful and sensitive boy). It's a sweet, touching film."
4,Good Movie,"It's a bit cryptic at first, but you get the jist of it. Slightly disappointed in lack of dialog with the main characters - a lot of ""B Roll"" was used, sometimes a little too much (made if feel as tho the purpose was to run out time [filler]). Not as good as Transnation but better than Tarnation. I plan on buying the soundtrack tho - the song 'Wild Tigers I have Known' is awesome!"
2,i pod case,"the item was not what i thought it was going to be. It did not fit my ipod :( this was probably more my fault though than the sellers, i misunderstood his description. The shipment was quick and everything was in tact. over all a good seller, I just misunderstood what the product was."
1,Unacceptable Sound and Volume Output,"As is the case with all iPod docks, you will most likely be disappointed with the sound quality and volume output that these devices produce. However, it is not so much the device as it is where the technology currently lies at. This dock, which I bought, is basically useless unless you use the iPod's ""lossless"" sound conversion format. Even then, the volume output on any home theater will approximately be at 50% the level as your CD/DVD player, set-top box, etc. would be. I am running a $25,000 home theater system and still cannot find an acceptable sound quality and volume level. Do not waste your time or money. This is a poor investment unless you can find one in the $30-$50 range - cables included."
4,Uplifting and I dont just mean the airplane ad,Great uplifting music to while away long hours on airplanes.Rejoiceful international feel to the music.No wonder its so popular as the Delta ad.
2,Broke my heart,"Couldn't get past the fact that they used nonsense words (wish l had researched on that ahead of time). Miriam broke my heart! lf you can live with the nonsense words, it makes for some good listening. The orchestra did a good job. Can't deny that."
2,Better off with Delerium (Karma) or any Loreena McKennitt CD,"I was frankly very disappointed, especially after reading all the positive comments from other reviewers. I wanted to like this CD, but it's definitely not on a par with Loreena McKennitt or Delerium or Enigma. The songs are too similar to each other. The mood is not reflective or mysterious, and not particularly sensual. The sound is reminiscent of Enya, but without even her range of variety."
3,Adiemus,"This album has several good renditions, but none surpassed the title song. I would like to hear more selections like the title song."
5,Let the Music Envelop you,"My mother let me listen to this recording when I was visiting her in Ontario. I felt slightly embarrassed when the tears fell from my eyes as the music completely moved me. This is truly my favorite c.d. of its type. When I need uplifting or beautiful music to read to or just pause in my busy day ,I place Adiemus in the stereo and get inspired by the gorgeous vocal and instumental sounds."
2,Ok....,"This product is ok, but the relief doesn't last. I tried it at my desk job because my back pain was so bad I could hardly sit upright. It did help the first couple times I wore it, but don't expect to wear it long--it's not very comfortable after a few minutes. I ended up using it off and on during 3 days of work, then tossing it in my closet...I doubt it'll ever see the light of day again..."
1,quite terrible,"wow! i was expecting the great japanese band only to get horrible christian music. did they name themselves ""bleach"" because they are polluting the modern music scene? Please avoid this album."
1,"Too simple, even for a field guide","There was no need to write this book. It covers simple definitions, but that should be covered in a good glossary. Definitions just aren't enough."
5,My baby loves it,"I bought this for my 5-month-old, who absolutely loves it. I didn't realize it makes noise, but if you push on the nose, it barks. THAT is what my baby loves so much! It's very cute to see her so excited by it! :-)"
3,Pupsqueak lost his bark,My son loves talking to the happy faces on the Lamaze toys and enjoys batting at and grabbing the different parts. Unfortunately this puppy lost his squeak after only 1 month. We don't really miss it though.
2,Remastered in the early 90'S,"A problem that I've noticed with many online stores that sell cd's, if it's an older cd ( import ) that has been remastered, often times the product details are sketchy at best. My criticism of this particular cd and amazon as a buyers website, is that nowhere on the product detail page did it say when it was remastered and where it was imported from. The cd was remastered in the early 90's and the import came from British Columbia. The technology has come a long way since the early 90's and I've found that the best imports to buy remasters from, is Japan. My opinion on this this product, is that the cd was way over priced and that the sound quality of this remastered cd, was mediocre at best. Not a good purchase."
1,I think they all work for Wampus!,"Hey, I'm sorry, I'm listening to it right now and it is...absolutely horrible! If you go way back with Jo-Jo, stay away from this garbage. Who's kidding who - It appears to be a bunch of locals (DC) doing disastrous covers of Jonathan songs. No feeling, no heart, no character. Totally bogus and contrived. Jonathan deserves so much better than this."
5,"one of the best, completely ignored synthpop new wave bands of the 80s","HOW did this duo never get new wave airplay in the states? Part Midge Ure/Ultravox, part Gary Numan, part John Foxx, part Erasure, all melodic synthpop perfection. For some reason, this disc of 1991 remixes is the only one available on amazon, but all five of their albums from 1982-1987, as well as a 2-disc set of all their original 12"" versions are available on amazon.de, so go there to get them all. I don't know WHY they aren't available as imports here on amazon.com. The names of the CDs are:1. Passion Factory2. Modern Lifestyle3. A Wild Romance4. Until The End of Time5. Hold on to Your Dreams6. 12"" Classics and Rare Tracks"
2,An extended fan-mag article,"The author tries to match Waits with his metaphor magic and of course fails. This kind of punchy ""clever"" writing might work for a magazine but is very hard to read for an extended period time, as in a book. There are lots of weird mistakes (is the author English and missing some things?) and the font used is almost illegible. Still it's the only book I know of and somewhat helpful if you can find the facts among the fluff."
3,more fanzine than fact filled,"Tom Waits is one of the great iconoclasts of the late 20th Century. His lyrics are brilliantly subversive laid over a simple jazzy sound. I bought this book hoping to gain some insight into Waits the man but I found the book to be somewhat abbreviated and abridged. This is more like a pulpy, fanzine type of bio that doesn't really probe the depths of this complex musician. It will feature small morsels of info but for the most part, it does little to get down to the heart of the matter. It does have moments but it doesn't quench one's thirst for knowledge and understanding of Tom Waits."
5,This course is superb introduction into UNIX!,"It is a first part of his bigger course and it includes ""UNIX Essentials"". For someone who needs a general introduction to UNIX, basic commands, processes and file operations it is a way to go. I would say this course teaches and explains some 75% of commands one ever will type at command prompt. If you need certification you should go with their ""UNIX Essentials and UNIX Core"" DVD. There are many reviews for this bundled DVD course and everything people have said there is applied to this title because it is a first part of the bigger course. This DVD even teaches my ten years old son as he had been captured by Boris's voice and stay with me to type commands. I can really appreciate the effort was put in the production and attitude."
3,Good sole. Loose upper.,"I have 3 pairs of Sanuks and i love the shoes. However this model is not the best, because the upper part became loose very quickly and no longer supports my foot well laterally. The Donny model is much better."
5,As described,"This switch is exactly what I was looking for. I have a Bose Cinemate system which only allows for one TOSlink connection, yet I have an HD cable box, a Sony PS3, an HD TV, etc, that all have their own digital optical inputs. By running all cables to this switch, I can very easily switch between the sound source depending upon what I am viewing at that particular time. It's a great product. The design feels a little cheap because it's made of plastic, but it serves the purpose and just sits on my entertainment center, so again, I am pleased and feel the ease of use, design, and functionality warrant giving this 5 stars."
5,Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio Optical Toslink 3-Way Selector,This product is a great addition to any older home theater system\receiver that has limited digital audio inputs. I have 3 devices that use optical audio connections and only 2 inputs to my Sony receiver. Totally worth the money and it works completely as advertised.The only way this could get better is if it had a remote!
5,This is Amazing!,"I have an old Onkyo sound system with only one audio optical input. I love the system, but needed a way to connect more. This did the trick. It even works from the Onkyo remote. I can switch from TV to DVD or DirecTV's receiver."
4,"Works as advertised, a few rare ""clicks & pops""","The product works as advertised. I cannot tell any difference in the sound quality except for the rare ""click & pop"" sound when changing from a standard definition channel to a high definition one. Very pleased with the purchase."
5,NYrius -SW100 optical selector switch and fiber optic cables,"I love this product, it is cheaper than to buy at other stores. It is working perfectly. No Complaints.In future I will rather buy things like this from Amazon or affiliated stores. It is very expensive to buy from bestbuy etc.REVIEW POSTED $25 OFF for the coupon for $25 off any item on [...].Tarsem Sharma"
2,Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio Switch Big Disappointment,"I purchased the Nyrius SW100 Audio Switch several months ago and almost immediately started having trouble locking in a ""clean"" signal when toggling between inputs. Over time it has become progressively harder to manipulate the switch and button to obtain a clear audio signal. The switch was probably defective from the start and should have been replaced right away, but the mechanical design of the switch leads me to believe the switch will have a short life span particularly if the switch is toggled frequently between audio inputs. Based on my experience with this product over a short period of time, I would not recommend the purchase of this product."
1,Disposable Switch,"I have owned the switch for only 6 months and it has already broken. It started out great and as weeks went on you could start to hear the drop in sound quality. I didn't think much of it because after a couple of minutes it would work fine, until one day I just couldn't hear anything. After a couple minutes of trouble shooting I found out that it was the switch that was the problem and not the cables, or the receiver. If you are looking for a quick, cheap, and short time solution then this product is for you."
1,"Lower grade switch, not bad for price","I used this for about 3 months before it died. 1-2 switches per day between PS3, 360, or home server. After about a month it began working intermittently. After 2, you had to be extremely careful putting it in each position. After the last month, only one port still worked. I assume the mirrors are falling out of alignment, but I just will not use this anymore. Ended up purchasing a different surround sound receiver with optical inputs."
4,Works Expected,"Its a very simple item to use I bought it to connect my DirecTV and PS3 to my home theater that only have 1 optical input, I have it for a month now and works perfect. It was a little big that expected."
2,It could be better,"I bought this to replace another brand that quit working altogether. One of the ports works fine but the other ports produce intermittent audio, a very irritating problem for one who likes to hear every note."
4,Nyrius optical switch,Works good as long as the cables are six feet or less in length.Called the support number to find out about cable length and they had very little info but were very nice.
5,Works awesome,"Works great, easy to set up. Noticed an immediate improvement in sound quality when I hooked up my sound system through the switch. I have an xbox, ps3 and satellite tv all running through my bose system with this."
1,Worked great... for about 3 weeks.,Product worked fine for around 3 weeks. Then the sound started to go in and out. It stopped working completely a few hours later. Garbage. Should have kept the packaging.
1,DOA,"I received this item and it never worked from the beginning. With all the devices hooked up, my Logitech Z-5500 receiver would not recognize the signal. If i unplugged the devices optical cable at the switches end, the red light was bright. Once i removed the connector at the receiver end, I can see the light was dull. It seemed as if the signal was losing strength once hitting the switch...so much that the receiver couldn't even detect the signal."
2,Works and does not work,"Most of the reviews here are either great it works or bad it does not work at all. My unit was in between. It works for certain audio outputs. It works great from the xbox 360, the audio out from the computer motherboard did not workd at all, but then I added a new sound card to the computer it worked on that. IT does not work at all on the HD cable box. It seems to me that it may be the signal strength from the source that is the main factor, which if that is the case points to a cheap product."
4,fun flashback,thought my kids would enjoy this and they do....the 12 y.o. said the theme song was annoying but they liked it
3,"Nice, but not as good as I expected","This product has a nice scent, but it is a bit on the light side. I was hoping for a bit more scent. I loved the slippers, but felt the loofah and a back scrubber were a bit redundant. I would have liked a body spray with it. All in all, it is usable, but not worth the price. The scent was much like what you could find in your local dollar store."
4,Lost In The War,"I liked this book a lot. Lost in the War was a great story, but sad. This story is about a family whose parents were in the war. The mom is still alive, but the dad dies in the Vietnam War. Lisa's mom was a nurse. Her mom struggles sleeping through the night. Nightmares keep her up all night, and flashbacks of the war scare her. Lisa tries to help her mom through the bad times. Suddenly, Lisa has a project in school--it's about the Vietnam War. Lisa tries to get out of it, but it doesn't work. Lisa accidentally brought up about how her mom and dad were in the war and now the secret is out. Her mom does a presentation for her project. Lisa then finds that doing the project was worth it. I liked this book because I enjoy reading about the war."
5,Spoken by true fan and artist.,"I still have not heard anyone harmonize songs like the Emotions, they are the true ""Sisters with Voices"". I don't know of any female group today or yesterday that can touch these very talented ladies, as I'm writing this review I'm listening to my all time favorite ""Blessed"" (which has Maurice White's touch) I always get misty eyed listening to that song. I remember singing ""Best of My Love"" in my high school talent show, everytime I hear it on the radio I have a flashback. My other favorite is ""A Feeling Is"". I'm still a big fan and their music runs deep for me."
3,oh! my papa,"growing up in the fifties,i never really understood eddie's appeal,he had a good voice,not bad looking,but ladies man?it proves that being at the right place at the right time is 50% of life.Being half italian,i enjoy gossip and this is full of it,as a matter of fact eddie's full of it.but as a man who was on the scene,he spares no one.i hope he had fun being eddie fisher,he was nothing to anyone else."
1,been there done that,"I'm so glad I didn't buy the book. Eddie Fisher sounds like a highschool sophmore. The book reads in a very juvenile manner. Did this guy ever grow up or what? Is he remotely aware of how he sounds when he talks of his extremely good looks,{questionable} and his disgusting sexual conquests? Probably not.Do yourself a favor, with all the wonderful books there are to read, don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Read book in Norwegian translation 30 years ago,"When I was in high school back in Norway in the late '60s I found this book on my dad's bookshelf. It was the Norwegian translation (retranslated: ""Desperate Flight""). I have never forgotten the book. I find myself often thinking about it. When I recently went back to Norway to get my old journals I found I had made a note about the English title. Today I searched amazon.com, and it came right up. Needless to say I will buy it and see if I can make my kids read it."
2,"Good music, but only one Fela song","It should be noted that only one song (""Black Man's Cry"") is indeed a Fela song. This CD is a compilation of contemporary African music, and not a Fela Kuti CD. Although the other music is good, it is all of a very different style than Fela. For $14.99, this should be made clear to the buyer."
2,Disappointing For Tower,"Besides the title cut, which is a Tower Of Power classic, there is not much else on this album that will thrill anybody that likes this group. The song ""Yin-Yang Thing"" is the only other song on here that's really good Tower. ""Share My Life"" and ""Love Bug"" are merely ok, and the rest.....pretty awful."
2,"Top quality singer, bottom quality recording","One of the greatest baritones of the twentieth century is poorly served by this collection, simply because there is no indication of any attempt to improve the quality of the recordings before issuing them on CD. While there is great variety in the audio, some of the tracks have so much sound of scratch, crackle, and hiss that even nostalgia couldn't make them worthy. I have LPs that sound better!"
1,Baby broke through in less than a minute,"I tried using two of these to keep my 11 month old out of two cabinet drawers that are part of a fish tank stand. The drawers are at floor level. I installed the straps and they seemed to work well; the strap catches and prevents the cabinet door from opening. However, my toddler was no longer interested in opening the cabinet. He was very interested in the new strap and proceeded to pull on it. In less than a minute he pulled the strap out of the catch. I was quite surprised. The only way this would ever keep a toddler out of something is if they can't physically reach it, i.e they can't pull on the strap. I was very disappointed. This was a complete waste of money."
4,Top Notch,"Old School at its best! I was 8th grade when this dropped, and it is still kickin. Heavily sampled, used and abused. These days you can really tell a records influence by the number of samples that were stolen. I like 'em either way. This is a very good record, start to finish. R&B big bands need to come back!"
1,"It isn't you, it is me-- I don't speak Chinese","The DVD I received was in Chinese with Chinese subtitles-- not much use to an English speaker. At the main menu I was given three chouces (in Chinese): the first proved to be ""play the movie,"" and the second ""chapters."" I thought the third might be subtitles, but when I chose it, it just sent me back to the main menu. Disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing it."
2,Skip it.,"I'm not sure if this is more a story of a woman's survival after a nightmarish mauling by a grizzly bear, or an indictment of the Canadian health care system. Thank goodness the book was fairly short; if I had had to read many more pages about yet another infection, bout of depression, hospitalization, or doctor who wouldn't believe that she was in pain, I think I would have needed medication. I read all the way to the end, but the moment of enlightement or epiphany that the title seemed to promise never arrived. I had been hoping for some kind of information about how people actually cope with such devastating horror in their lives, but there was nothing here, just page after page of seemingly pointless suffering without redemption or relief."
5,The NWOBHM- Classic Band,"The Tygers of Pan Tan are legends of the British Heavy Metal Invasion otherswise know as NWOBHM(NW= New Wave). The Tygers are a great band with songs that get the adreniline pumping. The songs on Wild Cat are amazing-- The guitars and vocals really make this album what is, Great; with John Sykes-ex Thin Lizzy guitarist in the band you know it has to be good. The whole album is worth the money you pay. Plus there is Eight bonus tracks that weren't on the original album. Tygers of Pan Tang merchandise is hard to find so try and collect as much as you can becuase it will become rare very quickly. So pick this album up if you can."
3,Repeat info throughout- overall entertaining,"There was repeat trivia and a heavy reliance on Dracula, Tarzan, the wolf man, and Frankenstein. At times it was like- enough already! Overall entertaining though. Would like an updated edition."
4,Luke loves it,My five and seven year olds love to dance and swing to this DVD.The images are fantastic and we all love the music. Luke really wants a botz robot to play with too.
2,Funny movie,I came to not like this movie because it was to corny and the plot was week. Plus the acting really sucked.
3,"Too Much Humour, Too Little Action","The blurb says: ""When the bodyguard's employer is assassinated, the grieving son fires him. By inheriting his father's company, the son now becomes the next target and is forced to flee and hide out with a family who is unaware of his connections. Seeking redemption, the boduguard determines to find and protect the missing son. However, a gang of bumbling hit men thwart his efforts"". COMMENT: As a rule, I hate humour coupled with action. The episodes about mentally ill people are really awful. I bought this movie hoping to see Tony Jaa, which I have enjoyed very much from ""Ong Bak"", and ""The Protector"". However, there is very little Tony Jaa in this movie (20 minutes at the most and he appeared by the end of the movie). In due respect to Tony Jaa, I am happy to give this movie 3 stars."
2,Dopey Fun,"You simply cannot take seriously a film like THE BODYGUARD. The only reason I watched it was that Tony Jaa was given top billing. Jaa is one of the most exciting martial arts stars of the decade. Here, he is in only one scene, which is played for laughs. In fact the entire movie is too. The plot is merely a device upon which the director allows the stars to mug for the camera. The villains are straight out of the Snidely Whiplash school of acting. The hero alternates between playing it straight and for laughs. For those who have seen Tony Jaa in a few of his other films, you might recognize the same actors in similar roles. Though this is a pretty silly film, there are too many scenes of gratuitous nudity and graphic violence to make it suitable for the very young. For those who can appreciate the numerous ""in"" jokes and allusions to Jaa's other films, THE BODYGUARD is mildly entertaining."
4,Excellent,Terry Goodkind continues the story of Richard and Kahlan. This box set was worth it since I had the three books at once and could have read through them as quickly as the plot carried me along. Will recommend for Terry Goodkind fans.
4,A wonderful read!,"I really enjoyed this book. My mother bought me this book when I was 10. She is gone now and I found this Young American Book going through a box of her old books. She had written inside the cover my name and the date of December 1964. So I finally just read this book she had purchased for me long ago. If you enjoy stories about boys and their love a dog, you will love this book. I did, Thank You Mom."
2,An all-too-American mentality,"If you agree with these three premises:- During WW II, the Americans were indisputably the good guys- Sometimes a bunch of innocent people have to die for the greater good- The perfect urban landscape of the future is some kind of suburbanite mega-AtlantaThen you will probably like this book.I didn't."
5,The Columbus lie,"It's amazing that this country continues to admire, celebrate, and honor slave traders, and terrible people. It seems that the elite powers have decided long ago to feed the people poop. This makes the people more manageable. History, and religion are the disciplines that man uses for control. Those disciplines are manipulated by men, and have nothing to do with God."
4,Outperformed my expectations,We got caught in record low temperatures on a canoe trip a week ago. It dipped to 29. This thing is rated to 40. We lived through it. Comfortably. I'd also like to note that you could probably fit four normal sized people in this bag if you are into that sort of thing.Pros:-Cost-ComfortCons:-Maybe too big for some people
5,Good Easy to Intermediate book with really good selection of stories,"I am an intermediate learner . Most reading material are either too easy or too hard . As Eddie Izzard would say , many basic texts are irrelevant to practical usage. where can one use 'le souris est sous la table et sur la table' . the hard ones make you reach for the grammar book all the time.The 'Easy french reader' starts with a really engaging and sometime funny conversation between French Marc and American Julie. Then it has a series of chapters on French history, which are very good in keeping your interest. Then comes the best part of the book . A selection of short stories which are so excellent , that they are worth the price of the book for me .Unfortunately I dont find many further books written by the Author Roussy De Sales. I wouldnt mind paying for them"
4,Easy French Reader by R. de Roussy de Sales,"This book has absorbing lessons and stories in it, but I would recommend it only to those who have had a year of French for the first half of the book, and at least two years of French for the second half. The stories are all in French without an English translation, though there is a good glossary at the end of the book. It contains very good stories!"
3,RPF's review,"Starts well but rapidly gets rather difficult for a beginner. Second part re history gives good info' but much of vocabulary is of little use in everyday speech or reading,"
5,GREAT book,I have been studying French using Rosetta Stone. I wanted a book to read in French to practice. This book is fun to read and I enjoy the questions after each short story. So far it is helping increase my vocabulary and given me a great way to practice what I am learning.
3,"Roll fof Thunder, Hear My Cry","Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is an interesting book, but at most points I was bored out of my mind. Mildred D. Taylor wrote the book in an odd fasion, like a real person would talk. She did not write it in correct English. If someone would say, ""Excuse me, You all got to to move because I got to get through,"" she would write it as ""'Scuse me, y'all gotta move 'cause a gotta git through."" I don't mean we don't talk that, but at some places I did not understand what was being said. She should write in in correct English, because a nine year old would not understand what is being said at all. All in all, it was an okey book and Mildred D. Taylor should write a sequal to it."
2,Say What?,"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry was not one of my favorite books. I loved getting to read about the 1930's and what really went on in those times. But it was not very easy to read and had no real climax.I kept waiting for Logan's house to get burned down, or for Papa or Mr. Morrison to get revenge, or even better for Uncle Hammer to come be beat the snot out of the Wallace family. Yet none of this ever happened.The author also never really went into the details of who Jeremy was and why he was friends with the Logan kids. The biggest complaint is that Taylor never wrote about what happened to T.J., was he set free, hung, what?I was truly disappointed in this book, yet could see such great potential for this book."
3,Okay book,"Young Cassie is a strong girl during the Great Depression, butshe alsosees the racial problems going on around her. This book was GREAT in some parts and I could not put it down! Such as the part when they go to Strawberry and Lillian Jean humiliates her. But then other parts are sooooooo incredibley boring I feel like throwing the book against the wall and pounding my head on the table with impatience! But it is okay, but I always see newberry books as not that good, don't you agree? I have only read 1 book that was newberry that I feel should of gotten that award."
4,"great book, its a must read!","i was forced to read this book for a school report, it wasnt a book i would have choosen but we had to read it and i loved the book! the book is written from cassies, the main character, point of view. cassie is a young girl who lives in the south 70 years after the cival war, she is slowly learning about the bad things in life and how to deal with them, she also was 'showed' where she stood in life(after the whites) i would recommened this book to everyone, i only gave it 4 stars because it wasnt the best book i've ever read because im not really into that kind of book."
5,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK!,This boook is very true to history. It tells thee story of a young girl named Cassie who is faced with many racial people. She handles it though and as turns out.... well you'll have to read it for yourself to find out. I did a book report on this book and I really think that after it some people went out and read the book. It was truley a wonderful story.
5,way to treat a person,"i think, this book its tight. I just don't like the simmes boys cause they think they all that. Treating a person like they are less then human, is not the way. A person shouldn't walk up 2 u and discrimate against you because yout to short, to tall, to fat, to skinny, to white, to black, or just because thier ignorate or jealous. But, this book tells you how life was before, and tells you that its just isn't right to be a person like that. It shows you its not right to be mean to a person and to be kind cause no one wants to be treated in that way."
5,Thank you to my Core teacher who made me read this book!,"I usually hate books that people make me read. I usually cant enjoy them because I know I have to remember every single fact about them. Ugh. But this book, set im Mississippi around the turn of the century is...amazing. I would give it more stars if I could but I cant. Its just so...wonderful. And it deals with other stuff besides slavery. At some point youll probably read this book in school. But while wait untill then? Pick up this book and read it. Im 12 but I recomend it for people as young as 10 and as old as...100! So gice this book a try. And if you like it...Mildred Taylor has wrttin many prequels and sequels. So this may be one of the few books worth the Newbeery it got."
1,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,"I am in eigth grade and am an avid reader. I am most likely interested in all novels and am open minded towards them, however this novel is definately awful. The story line is good, yet the writing and myriad amount of adjectives is a bother and causes the reader to have a lack of intrest."
1,disaster! :o(,"how awful. how boring, uninteresting, and awful. this book does not give anything to the mind except for the knowledge that the black people did not have their way in life. nothing was good about this book except for the writing technique, which was fairly good. i do not recommend this book to anyone, including teachers of middle schools (i am one of them). only if you want to be under the influence of a conceited, self-centered story."
1,To Kill A Mockingbird dumbed down,This was on the required reading list for school and therefore I was forced to read it and I must say this was one AWFUL book. I love reading! I hate this BOOK! Do not waste your time here! Go buy To Kill a Mockingbird. That was a great book and about the same exact thing. This book talks down to you in a way that To Kill a Mockingbird never did. This is possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.
4,Hear my cry,"If you want to learn how blacks were treated, read this excellent book with action and drama. See how whites and blacks can get along, but don't take my word for it. Read it!!!"
3,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,I just finished Mildred D. Taylor's book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry and it was a good book. I liked it because it was sort of an adventure. I didn't know anything about night riders until this story. It is sort of a good book. I would recommend it to you if you like to have some laughs or some mystery.
2,funny,"When I heard that this book was about friendship, possible and impossible friendships, I thought I did not going to like this book. I considered that literature about friendship is often a thing for girls. But I was wrong. This was a very interesting book about friendship in the Southern States of America. The theme friendship was mixed with exciting stories about the difficult position of the blacks, and about the courage that was needed in those days to do the things you wanted to do. It shows how important a thing ( in this case a piece of land ) can be for someone. The book describes this struggle for self-respect and pride by telling the story of the Logan family. The book is very fascinating. A real must!"
5,TO SUM IT UP GREAT,"Taylor renders her writting ability near flawless in the novel ""Roll Of Thunder, Hear My Cry"". The story is about a family by the name of the Logans. They are a family that at the time period of 1930 lived in the South. The South was a wrecthed place to be at the time, and as a Black family the problems were just more evident. The novel goes through various scences of common actions of the time. For instance, Little Man was given a book handed down from White children and he refused to use it. This was a proud time in the novel because it shows that Little Man was not ignorant to the times. My overall opinion on the novel was that it was worthy of acclaim. I enjoyed the book and felt that the next book in the edition would equal the enjoyment of this novel. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to recreate the feeling of the 1930s."
4,This book was a great book!!!!!,I thought Roll of Thunder was a great book. I loved how it was written in southern dialect and you felt like you were there. I would rate it a 8 because it was kind of confusing. There were too many characters. I got them mixed up. I love Mildred D. Taylor's books and I want to read more of her books.
2,had to read for school,the shipper was great and super fast but the book its self I would never recommend it the only reason we got it because it was mandatory for school :(
1,Awful book. Do not waste your time or money!,"Sorry this story has been told much better before. Try ""To kill a Mockingbird"" before wasting your time and money on this book. Characters are written without any shades of gray. Most of the white characters are evil. There is a token nice white man thrown in to make it somewhat PC!I found the episode where the main character Cassie beats up a white girl who has been verbally abusive to her disgusting.This book does not set the stage for a discussion of kindness, respect and understanding about racial injustice.Awful. Do not waste your time or money."
3,I kind of thought this book was boring.,"I thought that the book, Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry, was an okay book. I liked how the book made me see how cruel the white people were to the blacks, and I also liked how Cassie stood up for herself whenever Lillian Jean would be rude to her. Usually when I really like a book, I don't want it to ever end, but I couldn't wait to be done with this one because it bored me with a lot of unecessary, yet I would recomend this book because it teaches you a lot about racism."
3,A good enlightenment for children nowadays.,"We had to read the book for our literature course, and we found it a good one. Although there are many books written about this subject, it stays interesting. We can't imagine how white people can act this way towards others, but since it is a childrens book it is an enlightenment for young children nowadays."
5,Pryors finest hour,"Richard Pryor has influenced scores and scores of comedians and theres a good reason why....because hes one of the greats!!! This show which was filmed in Vegas is truly his finest hour. Taped after his infamous freebasing incident, he touches on his cocaine addiction....and as brutal as it was he makes it funny. Also, he talks about gangsters he used to work with and them telling murder stories!! No comedian would dare touch on things like this, and to make these things funny takes TALENT. Of which Pryor has an abundance of.So if you want a revealing, awe inspiring, provacative and funny comedy show, this is it. Pryors finest hour, the show of himself."
2,A butchered performance,"The producers of this film, evidently thinking people weren't going to recognize what was funny in a Richard Pryor stand-up act, all but butchered a good performance by *overdubbing* conspicuous applause and crowd noises at odd moments and frequently cutting to shots of the audience, obviously shot at different times, and inserted at random. When listening to an amazing stand-up comedian as Pryor, the last thing you want is for the camera to stray off the stage..."
4,Definitely NOT MacGyver!,"As an avid fan of the MacGyver series, I find Richard Dean Anderson superb in this twisted stalker/murder movie...a must to see for anyone who enjoys a good mystery!"
1,"I agree with hayf2 ""hayf2""","I agree with hayf2 ""hayf2"", had the same problem. When I first used it a few times it was great! Then over a year later it wont even turn on. I tried charging it for hours but only just a little bit of light comes out."
1,This book is a safety hazard,"I shudder to think how many accidents and deaths this book has caused. Cops are trying to save lives - even Mr. Carroll's life. And here he is, encouraging drivers to drive dangerously and feel immune from the consequences. Mr. Carroll cannot prevent the accidents that result from this encouraged behavior. Justice would be Alex Carroll being hit by a speeding vehicle driven by a fool who bought his book."
2,Domestic Violence,"55% of all domestic violence is caused by women Not men. This book only seperates and promotes a discrimination against men. Both men and women are abused and should be treated the same. This problem will only start to be solved when all Shelters are open to men and women, not just ""the weaker sex."" Everyone should care about this problem because, ALL VICTIMS IN UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM USUALLY WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE - which means YOU PAY more and more FOR THEIR CARE."
3,cute,This is a fun enough video to keep a few little girls entertained for a while. It's one that can always be passed along.
3,They sent me USED shoes,I bought and paid for NEW shoes and was sent USED! The soles had definite scuffs on them that had been buffed and there were even creases in the leather from being worn. I would not buy shoes from them again.
2,Sizing WAY off,"I was really looking forward to wearing these shoes. The price made the purchase very attractive.However, when I tried them on, I couldn't get them on my feet!I wear a size 12 and they felt like a size 9-10 (seriously).This may be a brand you would be better off trying on at a shoe store."
4,Disappointed with size :(,"I bought these for my husband (Black, size 10.5) but they are too small. He could barely squeeze his foot inside! He says it's tight along the entire front half of the shoe (too narrow). He does not normally wear wide width so my guess the size is simply off. I would say minimally 1/2 size too small.Overall, it's a beautiful shoe, perfect for the office, good workmanship. There is a nice gel pad built in for the heel. Too bad we need to return :("
5,Perfect Recordings - Excellent Sampling of Meek's work,"Basically I can't, nor do I want to stop listening to these two discs."
3,Good product,"good basic product, but not very reliable and breaks easily. Maybe a metal one for the future? Just a few thoughts"
1,Not what I expected,"I got this and it's JUST the handle, you would think with it's suggested retail price of over $100 it would be the whole setup, or that it would mention somewhere OBVIOUS that it is not a fully functional shower unit. The water pressure isn't very high for either of it's TWO setting, that's $50 per setting (MSRP). I see that they dropped the price from the $20 I paid to $14 now, in my opinion that's still not a very good value. I actually used the product for a few days with an old hose and then went to Costco and bought a FULLY FUNCTIONAL showerhead unit for around $30, I recommend that..."
4,INCONSISTENT COLORING,"I LIKE THE WAY THEY MADE THE PULLS LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT THEIR COLOR FROM PIECE TO PIECE WAS NOT CONSISTENT. ONE BATCH HAD A LARGE AMOUNT OF ANTIQUING AND ANOTHER ALMOST NOTHING. ORDER EXTRAS SO YOU CAN SHIFT THEM AROUND. STILL, THEY ARE WORTH THE PRICE."
3,CRAZY NIGHTS,Crazy Nights is a good album but didnt quite live up to its reviews that Ive read here. I will say that they put out some good music however on Crazy Nights maybe it was because it was rushed the lyrics just seemed lame. If you listen to other music of the same period say Riot and the Rods you get what I mean.Maybe they deserve some cudos for the time period but they could have been better. Still Im happy to have the Tygers in my collection.
5,Excellent. Cannot be better,"As a beginner, I found this book very helpful. For the first time my indoor plants are healthy. This book was a great help in how I can decorate with plants for it gives examples for every type of room in a house. The most interesting parts of the book were the A-Z plant library - it helped me recognise what type of plant I am taking care of and how. In this section there is the propagation method which is very helpful. I would like to thank the author for giving me more knowledge about my plants!"
3,I don't get it,"My stars should be 2.5, if that were available. Usually I find that my fellow reviewers on Amazon contribute a great deal of information about a product and tend to steer me well. In this case, I don't understand their warm recommendations. The book is mediocre in that it has a lot of plants listed that one does not see commonly in garden centers or even in more specialized nurseries. It could be that you have to get the first book to understand the second book? It would have been nice to know this in advance. Other than this, the book has a lot of good information about how to present your houseplants, which is useful. It is not a bad book by any means, but it is flummoxing as to why it received such consistently high praise from over fifty reviewers!!"
5,This book stays on my coffee table!,"This one is a keeper. A very informative book on house plants. I haven't found a book with this much information in years. Excellent photography and illustrations. The ""secrets of success"" section for each plant is very helpful. A must for houseplant lovers!"
3,Not a basic easy to use book,"I was hoping this book would help me save a couple of plants that I have for which I just didn't know what I was doing wrong. This book is not for beginners like myself. The book is very good at helping you identify the name of your plant, but there isn't much else. I thought since the book was the world's best seller of house plants, I would find out everything I need to know about how to take care of my houseplants."
5,these guys are loonies!,"the moment i started reading this book, i just can't seemed to put it down! chapter after chapter, one reads about the crazy things these guys do, i highly recomend this book, specially if both of your feet are planted on the ground, definitely not for those who are afraid of flying! Spike Nasmyth is a consumate story teller and reading this book is like having beer with the man himself!"
5,This Video Should Come With a Warning Label,"Beware - once you have seen this performance of Forza Del Destino, you will never, never be satisfied with any other version. This is, simply, the best of the best. Once you get past the absolutely hilarious stage sets and Franco Corelli's hairnet, you will be completely mesmerized by this Forza. There will never be singers like this again. I would advise listening to it (just turn off the TV picture) at least once a week for the rest of your life. I have the CD as well, and prefer the sound on the video. Each of the stars is unsurpassed in this performance but Corelli's Alvaro (to me at least) is what brings it all together.) All of Corelli's Forza's (indeed all of his singing) is superb, but this is the jewel in his crown. The only reason to take one tiny point from one star is that the ""sleale"" scene is omitted."
5,Another Magnificent McCoy Book from Tori Carrington!!!,"David McCoy is DC's mad-man cop. He takes risks and ignores rules, but he's a man of honor who's good at what he does. And he's about to get a new partner...ex-New York cop, Kelli Hatfield. A blond bombshell who packs a weapon and enough sexual heat to warm up the coldest of hearts. David is falls in instant lust. But the more he gets to know Kelli, the more he's feeling something...something more than lust, something intense. Something big. David and Kelli are out to catch a murder and catching something else in the process...could it be love?Tori Carrington's The Magnificent McCoys is a series that never fails to delight...and this new installment, You Only Love Once, is no exception. A great story by a great author!"
3,boop,"Beautiful color and quality. Dimensions given make it seem like bills fit. Be aware that you will have to fold all the money you carry in this, making it bulkier."
3,Sort of a Cossack king arthur story,"Another Cossack warrior is famous in literature:Taras Bulba.Many don't realize that they are talking about the same bunch ofNomandic tribesmen! The idea that a leader has a fate to bea leader and savior is almost universal between peoples.Seen in the stars and foretold by prophets, the Moses, Jesus,and King Arthurs are all through literature and history.This story talks about the son of a king who is fostered by a wisemanand teacher.Historically Janybek Khan defeated Muhammad Shaybani of the Uzbeks at Turkestan in 1470which seems to be the time period represented by their being cannon used in the siege.The movie seems more like legend than historywith the narration.I liked the movie for the action and historicalrealism."
1,"WOW, what a bad movie!!!!",First thing first they ripped the 300 font and then released it a week before 300 is released. Talk about tacky yet intriguing enough to see what it was about.Well the acting is horrible. Jason Scott Lee has fallen so far. The sets were very bad also.The worst part was having the 2 boys grow up and instead of hiring actors from that background they hire one of spanish decent and one of white decent to play them. VERY LAME.
3,"Decent film and action, just not groundbreaking in any way. Good for Kazackstan though.","Not that all the history in this movie is absolutely correct, but Kazackstan and the Kazacks probably like the history of this movie. But for most americans, I would probably guess most won't care. A wandering wiseman (nomad) has visions and prophecies that guide him to find the child, the decendent of the great Ghengis Kahn, who will rise up and unite the Kazack people and overthrow the Mongolian hoard invaders. He does find this child, and hides him in his school for fighting with other boys from tribes all around the Kazack planes. So,as you can guess, a time comes where the young man learns his fate, love is involved, and his best friend becomes key to his assession to power. I though it was ok, its just the story wasn't anything special. Its the braveheart of the Kazack people though. So good to watch, but nothing to rush and get."
5,A good summer read!,"Nora Roberts enters the world of the Wiccans again in this book. We are introduced to the characters of Nell, Mia, and Ripley. I loved this book. It reminded me of ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" with a nice supernatural twist. Recommended to all Nora fans. I am looking forward to reading Ripley's story and reading about what exactly happened to Mia in her past. The start of another great series!"
3,Haven't I seen this before?,"I was really excited to see a new Nora Roberts paperback. I just wasn't impressed with this one. I've read better fiction books dealing with wife abuse. Also better romance books dealing with supernatural powers, probably by Nora Roberts. The part of the story that reminded me the most of something else I'd read or seen was that lobster trap scene. Where the thief saw the lobsters eating his head. been there, read that. Sorry Nora, just not really happy with this one."
3,If I could give this a 3.5 star,"This is the first book of Three Sisters Island TrilogySetting: Modern TimesI would have given this a 3.5 star...Sweet story. Love the whole stalker and faking her death plotline, though wished she had close family still alive. This is a witch series: Nell, Ripley, and Mia1st book- ""Dance Upon the Air"" Nell's story2nd book- ""Heaven and Earth"" Ripley's story3rd book- ""Face the Fire"" Mia's story"
3,I expect more from Nora Roberts,"If you prefer her softcover romances to her main line fiction (I do) you may enjoy this book, but: the magic thing wasn't as entertaining as in Enchanted, not as fully integrated into the characters' personalities--yes, two of the ""witches"" were new or fighting it, but it still was not convincing. The hero seemed to come out of central casting, and I didn't care if he won the woman or not. The heroine sets up a catering business out of her home without mention of passing health inspection requirements, etc. Roberts usually covers the details; she didn't in this one. The ending drags; I skipped to the last page at about chapter 16. Sometimes Roberts will produce one like this. She goes very fast; writes a lot of books, and does it better than most. Which left me expecting more from her than I got from this book."
4,Three Sisters Island,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm a big fan of the use of magic in stories, whether you believe in the supernatural or not, books like this take you to a place where it's okay to believe. It causes you to remember when you were a child and anything was possible."
5,A thoroughly wonderful love story,"I enjoyed this book so much, I read it twice in two days. Nora Roberts always knows how to tell a good love story. You feel like you really are living in that little village, and are involved with all of the characters. As with all of her books, I look forward to reading the second book in this new trilogy series."
5,dance upon the air,"This is the first of Three Sisters Island trilogy by Nora Roberts. I have read some of Nora's novels and didn't think much of her works but this trilogy is her best. This is magic reading indeed. I finish all three books in 3 days.The description of the island, the characters and the feel of the whole book are so vivid. You can feel the wind on your face, smell the soup bubbling in the pot and feel the pain of loneliness in the heroine. A must for those who like romance and magic."
5,Absolutely Magical!,"I recently finished reading this title, it was my first time too read anything by Nora Roberts. Absolutely wonderfull! Excellent read. The book portrayed good and evil with just enough suspense to keep the reader torn to each page. I read the book in two days couldn't seem to tear myself away, I love the way the author puts in just enough romance to keep you waiting and wanting more. The characters seemed real and true to life, it was almost as if I could envision the story coming to life as I was reading! A must have for any book lover."
3,Do abused women fall in love this quickly?,"I enjoyed this book, but I must agree with the reviewers who mentioned how similar this book is to ""Sleeping with the Enemy""...it's pretty distracting. But what REALLY bothered me was how quickly Nell fell into a romance with Zack. She came out of a horrendously abusive relationship just a few months before...seems to me she would need a little more time before she could trust, love, whatever someone else again regardless of whether he was ""meant"" for her or not. (Hey, didn't that happen in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" too?)"
3,Dance upon the Air,"If you want to read a book that makes you feel like your one of the main characters. I highly recommend ""Dancing up on the Air"". While reading this book you are on the edge of your seat and so anxious to know what happens next, you won't want to put it down. It is funny, while moving, romantic, and keeps you guessing the whole time."
3,Predictable but Entertaining,"I usually enjoy Roberts' books and looked forward to this one. It was entertaining, but it was so predictable. It was as if there was a formula and she just filled in the details. I knew what would happen very early in the story and it did.Other than her husband, every major person was so perfect in looks, personality and motivation. Too good to be true.In addition, as someone else mentioned, the ending seemed rushed.Despite my criticisms, I found the book reasonably entertaining."
5,One of the best I have ever read!,"I do not usually read contemporary romance, and I have never read Nora Roberts before. But something about this book said, ""Give me a go."" Am I glad I did! I literally could not put it down!! From the moment I met Nell, an abused wife who has left her husband, Mia, a Divine Goddess, and Riley, a small town police woman, I was hooked!!It seems that these three women are connected by more than just being in the same place at the same time. The legend of the creation of Three Sisters Island has decreed that they would meet in this place and they would right a wrong that had occurred before.In one book you have the occult, love and the charms of life in a small town on an island. You'll love it!!!!"
1,"Novel or ""Intro to Witchcraft 101"" ?","I have read many of Nora Robert's books and have usually found them reasonably enjoyable. They are well written and tell a good story. Actually, Dance Upon the Air is also well written, very well written....however, it lifts up and glamorizes the Art of Wiccan practices, so that basically, it is a primer in ""how to"". This was a surprise to me...as I Christian, I found this highly unacceptable and dangerous to the uninformed reader. What was most disturbing to me, was the beautifully seductive picture drawn, which could very easily entice someone into thinking these types of practices were not only acceptable but beneficial. I suggest to readers that they need to be aware of the content of this book. I would not encourage anyone to read it...I was saddened and disapointed to find this in a novel meant for entertainment."
4,It Crowd /4,"The British do sit-com really well or really crap.this one is very good. Well written,well acted;the characters enjoy their roles and it,s about NERDS.Worth a watch."
5,Light in darkness,A great Catholic writer - VERY PROFOUND and very DEEP!He sheds a lot of light on the meaning of faith.
5,WOW!.. a must read,"Ok, first off.. I don't know what it is, but I'm a sucker for a book with a GNOME on the cover. I don't know, just gives me the warm fuzzys.Moving on, LOVED this book. Wow, Jordan Sonnenblick did such and excellent job blending the funny with the heart wrenching serious. I laughed hysterically, cried with my whole self and completely fell in love with Alex Gregory. The humor is so well balanced with the heavy emotions and serious topic matter, that the story never lags and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish. The characters are likable, well developed and undeniably relatable. I hadn't expected to like this book as much as I did, but it's truly a powerful must read, with a strong message done is such a way that readers of all ages will enjoy."
5,EXCELLENT HISTORICAL ROMANCE!!,"THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK!!! I LOVE THE GRAHAM'S. I HOPE THAT SHANNON DRAKE CONTINUES WITH THIS FAMILY. THE MEN ARE WONDERFUL. BIG, MUSCULAR, MANLY MEN WHO ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE. SOMETHING EVERY WOMAN WANTS. THE HEROINES TEND TO BE A BIT SELFISH AND AT TIMES FRUSTRATING, BUT, THAT DOES NOT KEEP THIS FROM BEING ONE OF THE BEST SHANNON DRAKE BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ. WELL, ALL OF HER BOOKS ARE GREAT, BUT, THE GRAHAM SAGA IS EXCEPTIONAL. FOR ANOTHER GOOD GRAHAM NOVEL, TRY ERIC'S STORY THE KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT."
4,"Fascinating, but suffers from being a ""second edition""","This is an intriguing book, and I was impressed by the sincerity of the author. She began her academic career determined to scientifically prove the paranormal, but over time became disenchanted when her experiments repeatedly failed to find ""psi"", and she found flaws in the experimental methods used by researchers who reported success. The book was originally published in 1986 or so, and has been updated with a few chapters added to the end. The book is valuable because the author is not a traditional debunker. I get the feeling she thinks there is something valuable to be discovered in studying ""altered states"", but she believes they are a construct of your mind, and doesn't think that psi is involved in them. I would have greatly appreciated a chapter trying to summarize all her ideas--There are a number of intriguing thoughts scattered through the book."
2,'Good Condition' was misleading for the quality of the DVD Set,"I luv, luv Law & Order:SVU! It is so well acted by the superb cast! Of course, I have my favorite, Chris Meloni! Really enjoy his portrayal of Stabler.The positive, the set of year eight arrived very quickly after placing my order.Negative: My disappointment stems from, and rating of only two stars, the condition of the DVDs themselves. I guess I expected the top surface of each DVD to be less worn, plus which number disc, eg; 1,2, is barely visible. The seller should have listed it as 'fair condition' at best. The DVD quality on screen appears to be without imperfections. I still paid more than it is worth in it's present condition; live & learn.I kept the set because I did not want to go thru the hassle of returning. However, I will be more cautious in the future making any purchases from this seller.Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year"
5,Excellent,This product was exactly what I asked for. Works great. No scratches at all. What a great season of SVU.
1,RUNS SMALL,"Chould not wear these the little spandex in them you whould think whould make these fit better,not! I chould not wear them,they where too small,This review was done by John's wife"
4,"Amusing, reassuring vignettes","Joel is just a nice guy -- no questions there. He's also insightful and humble so he can let a story tell itself without trying to show off his ability to write. His writing style reminds me of a baseball umpire -- an umpire is at his best when you don't even realize he's umpiring the game. Joel's stories are like that -- they just smoothly tell themselves without too much editorializing and too much dramatization. He also doesn't use his book as an opportunity to list the litany of freaks, kooks, and morons he's undoubtedly dealt with in his locksmith years in NYC. These are funny stories, but they are more about everyday people and what they do to fill their time and make ends meet. It's the type of book that reassures you about the quality of people around you and makes you realize how extraordinary an ordinary life can be. It's a quick read, a few hours at most, but it's well worth it. I only wish there were more books by this author."
5,LA NATURALEZA NOS PUEDE CURAR...,"ES MUY SABIA Y ESTE LIBRO TAMBIEN !La verdad es que curzamos los campos sin siquiera inclinar la cabeza a ver las maravillas que el cielo nos regaló...Y somos aún más indiferentes EN APLICARLAS PARA NUESTRA SALUD Y LA DE NUESTROS SERES AMADOS..Por muchos siglos, La HUmanidad sobrevivió gracias al conocimiento de las yerbas...Son inofensivas y curan...

1,Wind flap flaps,I actually have been thinking about returning the wind diverters. I put them on according to the instructions and they are coming loose at the ends. Vibrating as I drive down the road is not what I had in mind. Previous diverters I have bought slide into the window channel itself and have worked great.
1,actors errors,"Unfortunately the content of the VCR is not, repeat NOT the same as it is depicted on the VCR cover BoxThe singers are different it is not that as advertised!I really would like to get a copy of Il Trovatore with: Gino Simberghi and Vittoria Colonello singers directed by Carmine Gallonewith these people the movie was made in 1949!I wonder if anyone else found the same error?!"
3,A bit of funk to it,"I first heard of Rachael Lampa through the movie A Walk To Remember where she sang the song If You Believe and I thought her voice was beautiful. What I love about Rachael is her vocals and they really show in her ballads such as No Greater Love and My Faith. When I bought the cd, I was hoping for more songs such as those but the tracks were a bit more to the funky edge. The cd is not bad, but if you're looking more slow-tempo ballads with emphasizes on her vocals, you might be a little dissapointed. However for those of you who enjoy more upbeat and funky tunes, this cd is for you :)"
3,Cute adaptation and acceptable DVD.,"I got this for $1 at Family Dollar, and actually quite enjoyed it. The quality of the artwork in the animation is pretty much Saturday morning TV show/straight-to-video quality, which is what it was made for in 1988 in Australia. The transfer is a bit grainy and soft, but for a $1 DVD, it's quite acceptable. The story, artwork, songs are not the caliber of Disney's classic version, but it's quite entertaining, and a good item to pick up for curiosity's sake."
3,trip down memory lane,This is just as described but the reason for the three star reviews is the least engaging of the Charlie brown holiday specials. The Christmas one was clearly the best followed by Halloween. I am glad I watched it but probably won't again for at least five years. Who knows if DVDs will be around then?
3,3 6 always got tha midwest on lock,after seeing the 666 perform at market square arena with cash money i was checkin like crazy to see when this would come out. they didnt disappoint me with this helping but as with any compilation there are some garbage tracks. and i'll tell you right now if your a hardcore east coast head this is definitely not for you but if u like lil troy and juvenile and jt money then youll definitely be bumpin this for weeks on end.
4,It was cool,"This cd is a good cd to be bassin no doubt BUT, its not thebest 3-6 maf. has done. I personally think Chapter 2 was the best theyhave done in a long time. sixty-six sixty 1 aint even all that. But if youre a tur 3-6 fan then i reccomend you go and buy it cause its...cheap. Best songs: Azz&Tittiez;Big Mouth,Big Talk;D-Suckin-H,ans Who Run It"
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book and series. Others have said it better. I am just trying to offset Karen Shapiro's erroneous 2 stars. Please do not review the ""seller"" under the book review. That is not fair and is not relevant to helping people decide if they want to read the book."
2,Hard to watch,"This production of Richard Strauss' Salome was taped in 1977 with a decent cast, but no indication on the package or the tape where it was done. The packaging from Legato looks professional, but the tape is a badly done pirated performance, blurry at times, washed out color, and frequently jumpy. The sound quality is just about acceptable. Those wanting to see Caballe do the Dance of the Seven Veils as a striptease will be disappointed. She accepts each veil from a slave, fondles them and tosses them away. The most she lost was an earring, and this fan, who thinks she should have stuck to her Bel Canto specialty, where no-one could float a beautiful note like Caballe in her prime."
4,Very very cool stuff,"This album is beefy. It just blows me away everytime I listen to it. It's heavy metal with a latin tinge! That's so cool. This is definitely music with an attitude. The music rocks and I especially LOVE the latin percussion work. Funky, groovy and screams in your face! check it out."
4,aggrocore,"apparantly matt doesn't know the difference between metal and rock, rap and grind, tom and jerry. stitch's music is so far from slipknot, matt maybe it's the altitude. although they both do start with an s. but if you do want to compare an s word with stitch, try soulfly. this new cd is remastered and remixed and will kick you in the head from beginning to end!"
2,Great characters but glacial pace,"I was barely halfway through the book and could not read another word! My brain glazed over in frustration and weariness. Despite the waste of money, I can't bear another paragraph. The characters are very interesting, even the second tier characters, and I really want to know how everything works out. However the pace is slower than mud drying in the winter. The book's pace is deceptive, too. The characters talk about moving the plot forward, they seem poised to move the plot forward, they ruminate on moving the plot forward and NOTHING happens!It was very disappointing especially since I inadvertently bought a second book by Ms. Law before vetting this first one!"
5,What a deal and so resonent.,This solid mahogany guitar is fantastic with the through body strings. The whole formula gets you mega sustain and such a great playing guitar too. Who cares that the price was so low. very good quality and I have a few guitars.A+++
1,CD made by a 10-year-old?,"I needed a CD of the 1977 recording of Neil Diamond's ""I'm Glad You're Hear with Me Tonight"" so I could play one of the songs for an important presentation I was giving. I found, after a lot of searching, that it was available at Amazon. It arrived promptly and was packaged like an ordinary CD but when I opened it, it looked like a blank CD. I could not tell which end was up. When I did play it, it was o.k., only I had to crank up the volume to the highest level to hear it at all, and then it was barely a whisper. I also had to mark the side that was not the play side so I wouldn't have to guess next time I played it. Summed up, it seemed that when my order came in, the CD was very quickly created by an amateur, possibly a child. It was very disappointing to barely be able to hear the recording."
2,Sappy,This is one of Neil's many albums after he decided to be an unabashed shlockmeister.This boring stuff just makes one appreciate Neil's '60s hits that much more.
2,"Give me Starbuck, Give me Bionic Woman, but don't give me this!","Katee Sackhoff has become one of my favorite tough girls. Starbuck, Bionic Woman v1 both were great roles for a beautiful tough sci-fi girl...So I when I found ""The Last Sentinel"" I was excited with hopes to find an unknown treasure of a sleeper. Unfortunately, this was almost (but not quite)as bad as sci-fi gets.The plot was terrible, the story terrible, the acting mostly bad, the special effects were almost not existent... But at least it had Katee Sackhoff, which raised it one *Here's the deal... Pass on this!1 *"
3,Ok movie but not very original.,"This movie is like sp many others about a world where robots have taken over the world and a few brave freedomfigthers are left to try to fend them of, yadda yadda ya. We have seen it all before. But the movie is fun, the concept of talking, intelligent weapons is interesting especially for pepole that like this AI. The acting is ok. In short it is a ok sifi movie that will entertain for the time it runs, but that are completely forgettable and fail to stand out among the rest."
1,TOTALLY SUCKS!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS DRIVEL!My toilet is more interesting.If you liked BG, which is an A+ effort, this is an F, for flush down the toilet."
1,Don't waist your money,"The ONLY and I mean ONLY reason to watch this movie would be for Katee Sackhoff; who is not even the star of the movie as the movie cover would have you to believe. I believe the producers are attempting to play on her popularity in Battlestar Galactica. The story line is absolutely terrible unbelievable and laughable (especially when they try to pass off a 1980's IBM computer as the latest in high tech electronic equipment, yes they still have the old green and black screens). DO NOT waist your money on this. I'm sure at some point the Sci-fi channel will re-run this movie and if you must watch it (again for Katee Sackhoff) then do so. I have no idea why this was put to blue ray before even BSG was."
3,Ehhh..,It was not ask good as the first. No kids choice award for Larry the Cable Guy. Maybe he should stick to stand up comedy only.
3,Much better than expected,"When I watched the trailer for this film I had low expectations. It looked so cheesy and predictable. However, I was wrong. My kids loved it! I have to admit I really enjoyed it too. It is lighthearted but does have a story too. Yes it is a liitle cheesy but you will really enjoy watching this with your family."
3,The first was DEFINITELY better!!!,"I expected more out of this movie...the first movie was definitely better! The plot was somewhat good but the Larry the Cable Guy could never replace the Rock. The Rock made it funny. Larry, however, didn't. I think I laughed like 3 times throughout the whole movie. The first was definitely better!"
3,Cute movie,It's a cute movie. Good for older kids (5-12). My husband and I enjoyed it too ... even though it was a little cheesy.
3,I'm a small town Texan and find this awful,"This doesn't hold a candle, not even a spark to the original. We own and love the first Toothfairy film. This is a LOW budget knockoff. It feels lIke a HEY VERN MOVIE. Remember those? Lol!! There is obviously a smattering of Larry fans who will add this to their collection, but I'm gonna pass! The zoo is a much better use of an hour +."
5,kids will love it.,"This is a place to review the products not express an opinion against a celebrity that a person thinks is stale. For anyone that wants to know if it's a great movie for kids, my 4 and 5 year old love it. There is nothing offensive about it. It's not going to win any Oscars but I'm pretty sure the makers didn't expect a nomination. There is no violence and it's a cute story. Nothing about it you'll have to explain to your kids later. So for parents that just want 90 mintues of peace and quiet its worth the purchase."
3,"Took a couple tries, but happy now","I have some mixed feelings about this experience. I purchased this expensive watch for my wife's birthday and it arrived as planned the day before her birthday. The problem was it wasn't working and the CD in the package was missing. I called immediately and begged them to send another one so I would have it in time for her birthday and they actually said yes...However, the person (from another country) was essentially lying to me just to make me happy. I called the next day when I didn't receive the watch and was told I would have to send back the broken one, get a refund, then order a new one. Well...it was a hassle and I sent back the defective watch and waited for my refund, then ordered a new one. It just arrived and looks great and actually runs!! Well....I hope that this is it. As for the surprise for my wife's birthday...well that was ruined..."
5,K&N Filter,"Had a K&N before so I knew this would NOT disappoint. It gives a much better sound to the truck and you can ""feel it"" when you drive."
5,Turbulent beauty,"A heartbreaking band, and a rock-out heartbreaking album.""the fire"" is a keeper that you will have to go aroundplaying for all your friends for weeks on end-- a bass lineyou won't believe the brilliant simplicity of. fans of thecure, the bunnymen, early U2, joy division, but also great classic rock music you will love this album"
4,Excellent Performance!,"Finding renditions of Beethoven's Symphonies done in the ""Piano Four Hands"" format is practically impossible... I downloaded some from YouTube, a few were good efforts.. most were awful..There is an explanation of the Tempo chosen by the twin brothers written inside the case cover... take it or leave it (the explanation and the tempo)... regardless, the performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony is excellent, professional and flawless... one can tell the great thought done to play each of the movements of this Masterpiece.. and they do it right!"
1,"Great watch, horrible service","Watch is truly beatiful, but service from Amazon Suc*s. I received the watch with wrong manual, and its been over 50dd and I have not received right manual, neither a follow up call from Amazon representatives to know the status of my order. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH HERE. I know may seem well priced, but headache of dealing with amazon and its useless help/post sale lines is too much to handle."
5,Basket,I used these baskets in my classroom to hold my teacher supplies for the day! They are awesome! I love it and will be buying more very soon!
1,Cost tooooooooooooooooooooo much for what you get.,This item is not worth the price as it is only 2 lbs. worth of candy. You can get a 4 lb bag at Walmart for less than $9.00 and afford to throw away the flavors you don't like. This item would be worth 5 or 6 bucks.
1,Could not keep my interest,I don't understand the rave reviews of this book. It really offered nothing that kept my attention. The characters were quirky but not in a way that made me want to read more.
5,Like a fine wine,"Vigorito- his name even sounds like a rare bottle of cabernet that rules over the other bottles in the wine cellar. The simile is befitting for Vigorito is a master- a master of metaphors, a superhero of simile. He's the whirling dervish of the dictionary, airily plucking the choicest verbal fruits and then spinning them into a magical, mystical tale. In short, this is a book that is not to be missed.Easily in the top ten of my all-time favorite books. And though exceptional, I heartily agree with another reviewer who makes the comparison with Tom Robbins and concludes that though Vigorito is profound, he is just short of providing that transcendental experience that Robbins is able to deliver. Nonetheless, the reviews don't lie, this is a book you MUST read."
3,"Good, but not as good as Robbins in his prime","While it's not fair to compare two writers like this, I'm going to anyway. Robbins' better novels take ages to warm up, but when they take off you can forget about coming back down (and who would want to?). Vigorito is a great writer: excellent character development, decent plot, funny dialogue, nice wacky interlude pieces. But while the book takes off, it never gets stratospheric. You might fairly compare this book with a later Robbins novel, but this is no Jitterbug Perfume. Am I glad I read it? Yes. Would I read it again. Probably not."
3,More Herman Hesse than Robbins,"Couldn't wait to read it when I bought it, but not what I expected. Yes, I agree with other reviewers that this book was packed with ideas, different points of view,etc. but once you got it, it just kept going over it again and again. Characterizations were good (really loved the villians). Overall, good read and will keep you entertained."
5,mostly marvelous,"This was a terrific novel. If you don't mind poetic prose in the telling of a story, this one's for you. For me, the writing worked marvelously 98% of the time. 2% of the time, I could see what he was reaching for (and Vigorito reaches some remarkable heights with his linguistic faculty), but for whatever reason he didn't quite get it, or didn't quite get what he could have gotten. It's extremely heartening to know that this is his first novel. I expect perfection in his next.Esoteric writing critiques aside, the story itself was awesome."
5,Check this out!,"I just finished this book, and I'm still buzzing. It is a real treat to find a book that you can learn from, reflect upon, and be uplifted by all at the same time. I have been reading a lot of different authors lately, from Kesey to Dostoevsky to J.K. Toole, and each has something-- enjoyable writing, good laughs, relevancy, character development, something that makes it really enjoyable. The beauty of this work is that it has it all.I've been recommending this book since the day I started it, about four days ago. I recommend it to anyone who still has a gleam in their eye, a sense of the potential for all of us to actually ""get it"" one of these days. Right now, I feel I understand that thing I keep forgetting, having to remind myself of year after year, because its what makes things make sense.To the author: Good Show, mate! To the reader: Check this out!"
1,Do not get this!,Hey I am not sure if I have written these before but let me just say get another string. This one broke after about 15 shots. Please look elsewhere. I think the seller I got it from Hotimporttoys or something relative to that is pretty decent though. Merry Christmas by the way.
1,junk,the shipping was fast but i fired the crossbow two times before the string broke. it was very disappointing to say the least. i would not recommend this product
4,"If this was their worst, I'd like to hear their best","This was the third album of the great underrated band The Sound, and considered by many to be a weak follow-up to their classic From The Lion's Mouth. I wasn't going to get this album from all I heard about it, but I saw it marked down in a store and bought it on an impluse. And I was surprised to discover many songs I can't live without! I had Monument in my head after one listen. After playing the CD a couple more times, I came to love In Suspense, Where The Love Is and We Could Go Far. The biggest treat was the bonus track Sorry; I'm completely puzzled why it was left off the original album. The only reason I rate this four stars and not five is that there are several not-so-good tracks. That doesn't matter; I still got 8 cuts for my iPod out of this CD and they're great ones--what more can you expect from an album?"
5,It reaffirmed my trust in God.,"If you need to trust God in all your life, which we all must, then read this book and find out why and how. You will not regret it!"
5,"""Though He slay me...""","I scarcely know what to say or how to begin. I have all of Bridges' books and he is right after God's heart. He's quick to admit that he's a sinner and that he must keep his eyes on the cross. It's not as if he is lecturing or even teaching Sunday School.He's living with the same day to day battles that his readers are: lack of trust, unbelief, leaning on his own understanding, etc. I have a book of daily meditations and many of the entries are straight from Trusting God. That's how I became interested in acquiring this book. He gets you right in the heart, right from Scripture, and his reasoning is Scriptural. It's just a remarkable book, one that you will refer to again and again. Ray Barnes"
5,Trust God,"This book is wonderful and is essential reading for anyone, not only those going through hard times, but also those with questions as to how to let go of our anxieties and worries. Everything Bridges says he back up with the Bible, and he does not skip around the difficult questions, but addresses them. This book was exactly what I hoped for and will be re-read many times I am sure."
4,Help when the going is tough,"Even Christans can become dicouraged, and Jerry Bridges paints a series of pictures with which any person who has doubted the love of God during a crisis can identify. His explanation of the sovereignty of God cannot fail to encourage those who are in the depths of despair over the loss of a loved one, who are in the midst of a serious illness or who have been disappointed by the actions of others. Unlike many other books in a similiar vein, Mr Bridges backs up his points with scripture - the final authority for a Christian."
4,"""Trusting God: Even When Life Hurts"" became a very helpful book.","When I first started this book, I thought it was a bit preachy, and I wasn't able to keep at it for any length of time. Eventually, though, it began to envelop me, and I embraced the philosophy the author was giving."
4,funny series,I had forgotten about this series but it's really funny. My 12 year old daughter really enjoys it as well.
5,Alf season three,My kids are thoroughly enjoying this season. I remember watching these as a teenager and am glad my kids are enjoying them too.
3,"I, too, love alf but can't understand why we cannot purchase the full versions",I love Alf and am glad to have it available for purchase even though... these are clipped versions of the original series. The clipped parts do not change the plot but detract from the show. Fans who enjoyed ALF originally may get the feeling something is missing. I had to watch 3-4 episodes before I was sure something was missing but it definitely is. I do not understand why the company would not make the full versions available for purchase.The problem is that people usually either love alf or hate it. People buying this will mostly be hard core fans and we know most of the lines and it just takes away when a line we have come to love is left out.
1,No good,I do not want cut-up versions like these - do the job with respect for Alf and the customers and release the original full versions.
4,So What's *IN* it???,"I was a bit miffed that Amazon does not bother to indicate *which* books of the Ender's series are included in this set. So I looked up the ISBN. This collection is also known as ""Ender's Saga"" and contains the novels ""Ender's Game,"" ""Ender's Shadow,"" and ""Shadow of the Hegemon."" If you do not already have these titles, this is a great way to get into a fabulous science fiction series for any age. However, if you have already read ""Ender's Game"" (the first of the series) there are other sets available to round out your collection. Also note that this box set plus the ""Beyond Ender's Game"" set will give you 6 of the 7 novels with no duplicates (all except ""Shadow Puppets"", the latest one)."
3,Not the definative UFO package,"The song selection here is okay, but it would be a wiser idea to purchase ""Essential UFO"" (and Essential MSG for that matter)as those are the most complete ""Best Of"" packages available for those two great bands. Avoid all the other slapped together discs that are merely trying to sucker you in."
5,Classic hard rock riffs start here,This is a great intro cd to British hard rockers icon UFO. Theses dudes tore it up in the 70s (80s stuff is weaker after Michael Schenker left solo). Every track rocks the house and great way to get into this band. Dig a little deeper and check out their catalog from this decade for some deep cuts.
2,Hangs up - I'm returning my second one already,"I went to the Apple store when they received their shipment yesterday (9/6) and purchased my new Nano. After connecting it to charge it and put some music on it, I tested it and it froze after about 10 minutes of use. Couldn't get it to turn off - it wouldn't accept any input. So I let the battery die down over night and connected it next day. Still in frozen state. So I took it back today and exchanged it for another one. Connected it, put some music on it, and this one froze even before playing a tune. The software must not have been tested very well. It's not like I was doing anything unusual. Back to the Apple store tomorrow to return this, and I think I'll wait awhile to get it.The product looks great otherwise. The screen is bright and clear. Can't wait until they work out the bugs so I can get another one."
4,Lovely product,I bought this for my daughter birthday's present. She loves it very much. It is far better than 4th generation iPod.
4,Nano 3rd Gen. as promised,"I ordered the Nano 3rd generation on Amazon.com because the MP3 I bought my wife for Christmas was impossible to download music. Well, not impossible, but certainly inconvenient. I own a nano 3rd generation and it is an easy ipod to navigate and very simple to download music, podcasts, movies, TV shows from itunes or Napster or any media source. The one purchased was slightly used, a little scratched on the exterior(easily hideable with a cover)but in perfect working order and both my wife and I are pleased to own it."
4,Good safe choice,"This is a well built product to be sure. However the menu is complicated and hard to understand. Using the unit and transfering music centers around downloading and using the software, I-tunes.You would think it has an on and off button. You would think. (it doesn't, it just powers down automatically)This is more important than at first glance, due to the fact that the battery life is not outstanding.As overpriced as this unit is you would also think it would have an FM receiver which it doesn't have either."
1,Not worth the price,"The Ipod worked well for one year then quit just after the guarantee expired. I emailed Apple to see if they would offer any advice or help, but no response. I won't buy another Ipod. Instead, for about half the price, I'll buy a different brand that will basically do the same job. Then if it fails, I won't feel so bad."
2,I will never buy anything form this seller again,"I bought this refursbished but looks really used a lot scratches ,,a lot, both of them looks the same..(I got two for my two daugthers)"
4,"Great product, but broke in 2 weeks","My daughter loves this green nano, her birthday gift.But it broke in 2 weeks, before her real birthday date.Amazon responded very quickly and sent out another new one for replacement. Thanks a lot."
5,greAT!!!!,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT WORKS WELL BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AND SHE LOVES IT. PLUS THE SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST I BELIEVE I GOT IT WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER I ORDERED IT.
3,Very Scratched,"I ordered a refurbished ipod. Usually a refurbished item comes with a new shell. However, this ipod was clearly used and had scratches all over. They should have made the description as used."
1,Not so good,I have sent this item back twice. Talked to rep and they said that whole inventory of ipods are messed up. They are refunded my money.
4,iPod Nano OK - but over rated,"Purchased the iPod Nano 3rd Gen for our 13 Yr old Son. He loves it for the games and the Movies. Not bad quality, but Waayyy to small of a screen for my taste. If you don't have the vision of a 13 year old kid, I would not consider this for movies and video. Additionally, when I compare the sound quality of the Nano to the IRiver we bought last year, the Iriver blows the Nano away - Hands down! Finally, the iTunes site is not as easy to navigate as compared to let's say Napster . .my personal opinion. Make sure you download in MP3 formate if you want to play songs on different devices."
1,Never Received,"I never received the correct item ordered. I received two different, incorrect ones and could never receive any contact from whom I was trying to make the purchase. I eventually received a refund through the Amazon."
1,Not happy!,I purchased this ipod for my 14 year old grandson as a gift. He received it Oct. 2 2007 and in less than 2 weeks it failed. He gets a red X on the screen when he tries to recharge the battery.
4,8 mg Nano (3rd gen) - love it!!!!,"I love my nano, it is so much fun, I loaded all my cds and take my music where ever I go... iTunes is fun, I can download a single song or an entire album, however, the 3rd generation need more games. The only thing that disturbs me is sometimes the nano will lock up for no apparent reason and I have to reset it. And I don't like how some settings change on their own. For example, I set the volume of my game to low and when I go to play it again, the volume is full blast. Otherwise, the nano is a blast and I would recommend one to anyone."
4,Funnest Ipod I have had to date,I recently purchased this Ipod version because my last one puttered out on me. I could not be happier with the picture quality and ease of use. Once again Apple has put out another solid product I could not be happier with.
4,Great little player,"Bought it for my son. Awesome little player. Great sound and loud! Screen is drop-dead gorgeous. Although small, images are sharp and clear and video can be enjoyed despite the size. The photo album is well organized and the slide show is pretty cool. The new menu system is nice as well. My son loves the cover flow view, even if it isn't the most pratical way to browse music. My only gripe with the player is the placement of the headphone jack next to the USB jack. It's a little awkward inserting and removing the USB cable with the headphones plugged in. Other than that, I have no complaints with this player."
3,I wished these new I-Pods would have a radio to listen to,"So I can hear more music, news and listen to the play by plays from the ballgames. It would be nice if it does..."
1,wish I had never been excitied for it,apple has become such a ripoff...between the $$ spent to upgrade my OS against my will....I actually wish I had just stuck with my old shuffle. This has been the biggest pain in the behind Xmas gift ever...i feel bad for my fiance who thought I would love it and has seen it become nothing more than the biggest hassle for me. I wish we had returned it in the first place. I used to be an apple die-hard. This will make me rethink it in the future.
4,Ipod Nano 4gb,"I recently purchased the 4gb IPod Nano. I love this product. I travel and it is really nice to be able to use this product on the planes. It was easy to order from Amazon and the product arrived promptly. It was a used product, but arrived in ""like new"" condition. If I could change anything, I would have gotten at least an 8gb. Isn't that always the case?"
5,Apple 8 GB Nano,"I purchased this MP3 player for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. I think she plays it 24/7. Thus far, there have been no major problems with it. It has certainly lasted longer than two other brands which she previously had."
5,great bang for the buck,"This item is all you need in basic video and sound quality. It may be in most people's interest to purchase a new one, but I didn't need a video camera on it or huge memory. There must be thousands of teens with old nanos laying around for purchase. I would easily recommend buying this to anyone over the age of 35."
4,Pleased,Thanks for the quick and safe delivery of the ipod. Easy to track and prompt delivery. Good job!
5,Very Happy w/this MP3,My teenager loves this MP3 - also separately purchased a docking station/alarm clock and kid loves waking up to music. Purchased 3rd Gen because I was afraid the 4th Gen wouldn't be compatible with most accessories. Not a problem with 3rd Gen at all. Happy kid - happy parent.
4,Ipod 8 GB,"Product was as represented. Did not come with any cords, which perhaps should have been specified, but other than that-was as advertised."
3,IPod,The product itself works well - no complaints. It is not obvious from the instructions how to set it up. I think it stinks that it does not come with a case. I paid $119 for the IPod and then I had to buy a case for another $35. This is stupid and cheap on the company's part. Who uses this thing without a protective case? I use this while I am running and at the gym.
1,Not as described,"Even though the item was clearly listed as new on Amazon and the actual order confirmation, it arrived as a questionably refurbished model. I say questionably because it was decidedly not refurbished by Apple, but instead by god only knows who. I found this particularly disturbing since Target was the seller in question and not Uncle Wiggly's Electronic's Shanty or some other dubious retailer. Amazon categorically needs to monitor it's listings for accuracy as I've read several reviews for varying items where consumers have similarly received refurbished items despite having ordered them as new.Suffice to say the item is being returned for being not as described and until Amazon begins to police these listings more thoroughly. I'm forced to take my business elsewhere."
1,Broke on me twice,When I first bought it the inside screen was tilted then I returned it and got another one and that one had no audio coming at all. I looked at the volume controls and went online for help but it did not give me a solution so I returned it and got a different mp3 player. I guess I was just unlucky.
2,Fanboys Getting All Smug Again!!!,"So Steve Jobs has come out with another invention to make apple fans all but cream from excitement? Big Whoop. There are hundreds of mp3 and mp4 players out there that do 2x as good a job at half the price. More memory, smaller price tag, new body. So What? Meizu and Sansa are what I'm with."
1,frustrated,"we paid for this item (plus express shipping)it came 4 weeks later...and it will not accept any downloads from itunes, even after going through the latest itunes update...so we are 5 weeks from our order and still without music...help!"
2,You need the newest operating system!!!,Please know that if you get the iPod nano and you have a Mac/Apple you have to have the newest operating system. That means you have to have Mac OS X v10.4.8. You can't use it if you have Panther OS X 10.3.9. So you have to spend an additional $129 for a new operating system! Making the total for an iPod $129 more!
5,I love my nano,"I have this 4GB Ipod nano, I can't say enough good things about it. It seems to hold a charge alot better then my old nano 2GB (2nd Generation) Ipod. The size is great for travel and putting in your pocket. The sound and video quality is great, Video is amazing for such a little ipod."
5,It was the start!,"Love it. Very easy to load, use. On a friend's recommendation, went to a national chain and purchased 4 other brands of MP3 -- they did not work and were returned. This Ipod replaced them. From the time this came from Amazon, it took exactly 10 minutes to get it loaded and working Love it! Have since purchased one more 4 GB and one 8 GB."
5,Review of Apple iPod nano 8GB,I love this iPod - I can put all my eBooks on here and I'm good to go!
5,Best Purchase I Ever Made!,This iPod is exactly what I wanted. It arrived in the condition described and works like new. I've had bad luck with MP3 players in the past and decided on an iPod for my next purchase! I love it! This is definitely the best purchase I've made recently.
4,Great Buy!,"Although I did not receive this product in the time frame I was guaranteed, I still would recommend this seller. Product arrived in perfect condition & was a reasonable price. Worth waiting an extra 3 days I suppose."
1,Bad service from Amazon due shipmet problems,"I had a problem for the shippment of this item because UPS had a issue unable to find the location of the Hotel, they assume the problem and update you asking to refund me the money for the shippment.I never got a reply from Amazon, and I feel you've requested the money back from UPS and never refound to me. Just want to let you know I've paid 4 times more for shippment because I had to go by taxi to the UPS Location to pick up my product bought at Amazon."
2,Needs and FM Tuner,"This was iPod's chance to build in an FM tuner (with perhaps an antenna extension wire to plug into the earphone jack into which headphones could be plugged or not as the listener wished). But they didn't add this tuner, and therefore all the nice little iPod speakers that recharge the iPod while the ""remote"" FM tuner is plugged in are useless. I'll wait for the next generation of iPods and then, hopefully there will be an FM tuner inside!"
1,Amazon buyer protection works,"Bought what was advertised as a reconditioned 3rd generation 8G i-pod Nano. Was shipped a cheap, Chinese, no-brand MP4 player instead. They seller never responded to my return request, but Amazon refunded the whole purchase price, and didn't even ask for the piece back. I was able to buy an actual Nano, and I gave the fake one to a friends kids. Without buyer protection, I would have taken a $130 hit. As it was, all I lost was time. Not too bad, all considered."
3,good,"The only problem I had was when I called applefor some info. they did not have the serial number, which I thought was kind of odd."
5,Great!,"Listen to your music- your way! Huge iTunes selection! Just ausome! Never thought I'd get one- but here I am, enjoying it!Caution:I heard if you play it too loynd it cause heart probles! Be safe! God bless!"
2,"Yes, a music player can be too small","The nano is thin and pretty, and picture quality is amazing, but the device feels too insubstantial. It's so thin and lightweight that it frequently falls from my pocket, and there are no sleeves available yet. Also, the selection wheel is inconsistent - at times, it is so sensitive that it will rocket up the volume or advance to the next song at the slightest touch, and at other times it has to be carefully manipulated to get it to do what you want it to do. I also prefer the set-up that puts the headphone jack at the top - with the jack at the bottom, the device can only be slipped upside down into a shirt or pants pocket.I wish Apple had made some of the traditional iPods available at smaller sizes (with corresponding price reduction). I liked the feel of my old iPod photo in my hand but don't care to shell out that much money again for a device that only lasts a couple of years."
3,"Looks amazing, but am i missing some option for sound quality?","I'm no tech geek, i dont know about aac, and mplmnop's, I just know what sounds good. The 3rd gen Ipod looks amazing, it really does. WIth exception of the silver back which will probably scratch like a mofo. Just buy a case and you should be fine. Scratches don't really bug me as much as when I went to play a song using an expensive set of bose headphones, the sounds wasn't all that pleasing to my ears. Did they downgrade here or am I just missing something? Anyway, i'm returning it. I don't care about the cool video, I just want my music to sound like it does on my 2nd. It could all be in my head, but hey, I rather it sound good in my head. Also, the split screen is ok, it's nice eye candy, but I use this for working out and mountain biking, im not going to be needing that. If I want video on the go, I will buy something bigger and more dedicated to that."
5,Great,"It was great. One of my sons had this product and the other one wanted one as well, but the probelm was they dont make this one anymore. So thanks"
5,Very good and fast shipping,i ordered this product on a saturday and got it by Thursday very fast shipping and i emailed him with some questions got fast answers also the product was just like the item description
4,very happy with the product,I was having a difficult time finding a replacement for my previous lost ipod and I was thrilled to finally find it on Amazon. Very happy with my purchase.
1,Gave up after trying 2 different cables from this company,"The first cable didn't work at all. Amazon.com promptly sent a replacement cable.After the first week, the 2nd cable's performance became intermittent. When watching movies, dialogues sometimes sounded muffled, then the sound would clear up. Later the problem worsened with 1 channel almost disappearing, causing voices to be hardly audible while the music was loud."
2,Signs that can be stolen,"Nice signs though does not stop speeders. Within a few weeks they were stolen. Put in a police report, though no positive results. Needs to be able to be filled with water completely so signs can't be moved."
1,Second chances,Tape was in EP and not SP so it was in poor quality and didn't play well after a few playings. It appeared to be copied poorly.
1,frustratingly impossible to install,"I never could get the install to work. They ship you three CDs, and the first thing the install asks for is ""Windows Component Update for Visual Basic .Net"". Of course they don't send you this, and good luck finding it on their website."
1,Download Sun One Studio 4 for FREE!,"Sun ONE Studio 4 Community Edition is FREE. If you want to self-eduate yourself in how to develop web applications, it is a good choice."
5,Nancy in Phoenix,"What a WONDERFUL Bible Study for teen girls and so needed in these trying times of our culture! Whitney clearly writes with a heart to encourage girls to choose the right path for their lives. This study is practical and relevant. I certainly recommend it for personal, family and group study!"
5,Wonderful!,"I like it very much. It is very quiet, lite and pretty color. I am doing kitchen renovation and using this vacuum cleaner is a big help."
2,Flawed product,"Pros: easy floor cleaning, self-winding wire, able to clean hard-to-reach areas.CONS: overheat in just a couple of minutes, suggesting poor-built motor and making the cleaning job a nervous experience; not effective on carpet.Result: I finally made up my mind to return it before the 30-day limit for a better one."
1,"Great Vac, Terrible Warranty Service","Vacuum is terrific - no issues with it.However, the nozzle broke after about 8 months. I figured that it would be no big deal to get a replacement - the few times something similar has happened with other products typically all it took was a call to customer service and a replacement would be sent in a few days. Not with Panasonic - they directed me to one of two local repair places - one of which was over 25 miles from my house! I went to the closer location - about 9 miles away, but in the city - round trip it took over an hour.Well, it has been 10 days and I called to see what was happening. The owner of the business was a real jerk - he told me that it would take as long as it took and that he would happily sell me a replacement if I drove over there again (they had kept the damaged nozzle that I had duct taped).Wow - terrible service all around."
3,Just some info...,"I actually have not seen this DVD, but wanted to let others know something I've noticed - If you click on the picture above, a larger version will load, large enough that you can read the song titles! I assume this will work on other karaoke DVDs that Amazon has not posted the titles for."
2,Disappointing,"This is really not even a phrasebook, although it contains a few pages of phrases. Mosty, it contains wordlists based upon themes (food, weather, etc.) with very little help in putting them together in any meaningful manner. And half of the book is just a translation of the English part into Spanish, so really the amount of information is limited. Unfortunately, there is not much available on Rapanui except a very expensive Routledge grammar, so for the casual explorer, this is your best bet. But don't expect much."
3,A passable text on math methods,"I've already taught from this book. It will not lead you to an irrepressible passion for mathematics, even in the applied version, but it does its job of simplifying the thing, using the physicsl context to make some arguments plausible, and of providing a modicum of connective tissue among the diverse topics. There are some mistakes in the discussion of convergence of series, but physicists rarely care about these things anyway.Where are those wonderful books of yesterday, like Sommerfeld's ""Partial Differential Equations of Physics""?"
3,"Interresting, but...","Technically, all the essentials are there to use as a textbook, but the author makes it kinda difficult to follow the math. Also, the paperback version is extremely fragile, as the pages sometimes break loose from the cover."
2,"Help, please",Please please help!!I've learned c++ very well but I don't know!!should I go with c++ .net or c++Builder??Which one is better?????Please help...
1,Can you use XP Home Edition as Developement Environment?,"Has anybody installed this product on XP Home Edition? Does it work OK? I'm talking about actually compiling/linking on Home Edition, not compiling on XP Professional and running the resulting executable on Home Edition."
3,not sturdy enough,"I bought this for my class so my students can keep a set of vocabulary cards with them. The price is great but the quality is not the best. The first day that I passed these out, I had 5 kids out of 34 kids complain their rings won't close. For some reason it opened a few times and just won't work any more. I've only had them for about two weeks and I've gotten a couple more complaints. Overall, it's okay since the price wasn't as expensive but I was hoping it will last them all year...we will see."
1,"Vile, disgusting, far too strong, gives me a migraine","This stuff is absolutely vile. Unless you know the person you wish to give it to likes it, don't buy it. It is so strong and it gives me an immediate migraine. I've been in public settings where I was immediately struck with a migraine by perfume and asked the wearers what they were wearing. They always are flattered by the question... my query is NOT a compliment! I just want to know the name of the wretched stuff. Often, it's Red Door.Be careful in giving this to people - and if you wear it, please do so with caution. It's among the worst offenders I've ever run across. You may be making people sick - they probably won't tell you out of politeness."
1,Amazon will not accept return of item,"This review is specifically about Amazon and not the actual Red Door. My stepmother asked for it for Christmas, and my brother and I accidentally both got it for her. I tried to cancel my order before shipping (about 2 hours after placing the order) and received an email that it was not possible as it was already being processed for shipping. Now that I have received the item, I tried to initiate the return so I could get her a gift card instead. Amazon categorizes perfumes as ""hazardous materials"" and are not approved for returns. Why would a perfume be a hazardous material? It's unopened and still in original packaging. Amazon should accept returns for anything it deems safe to ship."
5,College Friend,It fits everything I need and more! I can actually fit all my books and computer for the day instead of carrying two bags. I really like all the pockets for organization and the durable zippers as well.
4,Overall a really good pack.,"I like this pack for the most part overall. I was able to pack enough stuff for a two-day business trip in it. My only (minor) issue is that the zippers seem a little stiff, and I'm afraid of working them too hard. That's one of the things that typically fail on these things. Probably just need to give them a little time but I've had other packs that disappointed at the wrong time so I'm being gentle with them. Otherwise it seems like a good, solid pack with lots of compartments for storage."
3,Good but cheap,"I really like this backpack because its trendy and I never run out of space. However, the clip broke after about a month after owning the backpack(I never used the clip), and cut my hand severely. Also it is very large and things can get hard to find in there, be careful you dont carry around more than you should."
2,Not very durable,"I bought this backpack for my 12 year old son and it barely lasted the whole year. It is very large -- more than a middle schooler needs -- and one of the straps on the side ripped in no time, leaving one side hanging open when the other was closed. One of the large shoulder straps is also in shreds. Wouldn't buy this again and would not recommend it."
1,poor service,"I paid the $25 7 days ago to ""expedite"" a backpack and it's STILL not here!! If I could rate this seller zero stars I would!!"
5,"Excellent school bag, awesome outdoors bag.","I bought this bag for school a few years ago. Now it's been around the world, fallen off cars, dragged on the floor, used as checked luggage, rained at, snowed at, and the only thing that broke is the clip (got stuck in a car door). And even after all of that, it still looks fairly new. What's also really impressive about this product is the amount of stuff you can put in it. I carry college textbooks, a big old chunky laptop, a set of bike tools and replacements parts, a TI-89 Calculator, and still have space to fit in a shirt and pair of pants. This backpack is at the top of the bell curve when it comes to price vs. features, it's definitely worth the investment."
2,"Great Design, Poor Construction","I have used my backpack for approximately two weeks on my urban commute. The pocket on the shoulder strap is too small for my iPhone, but I can still cram it in there and leave the flap open. I like all of the pockets to organize my stuff, the sternum strap, and the rain cover. I also liked the compression straps until one side broke; the fabric strap came right out of the seam. I am very sad that I now have to spend money on a new backpack."
4,It works,"It holds all my stuff, some of the zippers are annoying. The buckles are useless unless you want to look like a dweeb. Good backpack though"
3,For school,the backpack is nice but it isn't strong enough for the haul. I would recommend it for light travel not heavy books
2,Dissappointed,"I am dissappointed with this backpack. the build quality is a zero. The stitchings are horrible. If the process of handling a return was easy and quick, I would have return this bag without a thought.The bag itself has potential, but for furture buyers, look at all the stitchings. Mine had one of the elastic bands half ripped already. I just had my elderly mom sew that back up. (she like that kind of stuff). I wish there are some pre-inspections done from amazon to avoid poor quality. I just don't like waiting 2 weeks or more... By then I lose interest."
2,"Flimsy quality, had to return",I was appalled to receive such a flimsy looking backpack in the mail. I thought it would be of much higher quality. I had to return it because it was definitely not worth the money.
1,THIS COOKWARE CAN MELT!!!!,"There should be a warning about the bottoms melting!Just be aware that the bottoms are encapsulated copper. We left one of these pots on the burner too long and the water ran dry. This caused the inner core of the bottom to melt.When the pot was lifted from the burner, hot molten metal spilled all over the kitchen floor, burning a hole in the tiling and badly scorching my wife's foot.I liked the pots, but will never leave the kitchen while cooking with them from now on, and will never put the burner over medium heat either.It scared the heck out of our family.I plan on buying some new Revere cookware, probably the copper clad sets that are more expensive.My mother has one of those sets that she has had since 1969.I've only had this Ellipse set for about a week."
4,Great Set,"My mother in law purchased this set for my husband and I as a housewarming gift and they are just great. Easy to use, they heat up nice and evenly and so easy to clean. I love them. My husband has always been a fan of copper bottom pans and these are great for any couple."
5,Love it!,"I, too, have an electric stove - I'm glad others mentioned that! Cooks nicely, cleans up easily. Absolutely love it - great price, too!"
4,A appropriate book for those businesses in need of growth,"Writer makes overly bold assumptions without satisfactory data but points out very important trends and the value migration theory does make sense.Overly reliant on the ratio of capitalization to sales. Misses fundamental strength and core competence of older companies. The summary lesson of the book can be described as ""company be nimble company be quick"""
5,A classic worth re-reading,"I read the book back when it came out in 1995. At the time the dot com craze was causing people to re-evaluate retail, banking, and business in general. It seemed like a very insightful way to look at technology change. Fast forward to 2010, and with the death of companies like Blockbuster, the changes in the computer industry (smart phone ownership rapidly catching up to PC ownership), and the book's themes seem just as fresh today as they were in 1995.I think the book bears a message that is worth a re-read."
3,this is only the first half of the book,"Volume 4B is necessary to see the states with higher alphabetization. California is included, Nevada is not. The sights are good suggestions for starting a search. There many more sights not listed and the sights given are not necessarily easy to find. But it can give you interesting possibilities if you work hard."
2,USA flag made in china...,"I guess, I shouldn't complain provided how much this thing costs...It does the trick and looks nice from a distance but the colors bled even before I got it out of the envelope it came in, and it does show when it's hanging right in front of me in the car...A little plastic rod that is used to hang the flag keeps popping out which is annoying.And guess what - it's made in china..."
1,Egotist Drivel,I have never read a book by an author more egotistical and filled with self-agrandizement as this individual-I'm sorry but if I read one more paragraph of how the women could not keep their hands off of you in the hot tub I think I would ask to be put off in one of the life-boats-what a bloated sense of self! There are a lot better books out there concerning the QE2-avoid this one!
5,"Legendary german performance, poor visuals","First the warnings: 1. This is a German performance. 2. It's black-and-white, and 3. The visual recording quality is poor. It's difficult to make out the singers' facial expressions much of the time (although you can usually see them during the arias, fortunately).Then the strengths: the cast are all legendary singing actors: Fischer-Dieskau, Eliz. Grummer, Erika Koth, Donald Grobe, Pilar Lorengar, Walther Berry, and Josef Greindl. And Ferenc Fricsay, the best ensemble-conductor ever, leads them. The result is a performance no one should miss.I hope they release it again."
1,c#??? Java I suppose...,"The ide, the compiler and the whole package itself is great. The shame is that what microsoft calls c# is only java... Too lame... By the way it's as good as java, so it has all its pro and its bad sides"
3,"It's Java, pure and simple!",I've been working through the 'Visual C# .Net Step by Step' book (which is a really well written and structured book) and am really shocked at the audacity of Microsoft. This is Java renamed by the Microsoft marketing department. I'm amazed that there hasn't been more outrage expressed by the developer community at the utter plagiarism of a very elegant and popular programming language. In one word: shameful.
5,Wonderful,"I have just received my own jacket, and it is amazing. It seems to be made of material that is very durable in harsh weather. It also comes with a thermal lining that can be taken out and a hood that is hidden in the back of the neck. I live in Central New York, and the the weather during in wintertime can be difficult, but I can expect this to help me throughout any season. I am truly happy with the product, and I recommend it to anyone that is thinking of buying a coat."
2,Not for the discerning mind.,"Fatal flaw of this book is it does not provide date when the words and phrases entered lexicon. As a writer, this is important...can't write a period piece if unsure about usage; would be nice if the dictionary included dialect/region of origin or usage as well. ""Dictionary of American Slang"" by Harold Wentworth does provide origin/usage dates, just have to find the right edition (not sure if it's a feature of post 1980 editions).I would recommend this dictionary (or any dictionary on slang) to someone learning English language and needs help with American idioms. A second star was awarded for some rather crude vulgarities, you can't get such candid text in Arabic idiom phrase books."
3,Mixed 1998 Intrigue 3800 L67,"My review of this Condenser is mixed. The part is nice and new. I belive it will do the job as the old one did.I think the original is steel where this one is Aluminum. It feels lighter then the original, the piping is easier to bend and the material feels thinner. I found it extremely difficult to get the threads on the bottom connection to thread properly. Also the Top connecter didn't have the threaded piece to attach to the compressor line. I needed to purchase a bolt since the old condenser had the threading built in. No O-rings come with this Condenser be sure to acquire them before hand either from GM or Other parts supplier.I expected an ACDelco which should be the same as GM OEM to be more plug and play (snap in place friendly). However things appear to be moving forward and I expect to have AC soon."
4,Happy as Caterpillars,Our son loves to swing. We bought a baby swing for him to use on our swing set and he cried evertime he was in it. We still haven't figured out why. One day the little girl across the street was over and he wanted to swing with her. I ran up to the Toys-r-us site and purchased this wonderful swing! The two of them have a ball in this whenever they are together. They sing and talk and laugh for quite a long time. Our son loves it just by himself too. No more fussing. He sits and goes wee-wee wee.I gave this 4 stars because it needs just a little more leg room.
4,Good product but could be better!,"We purchased this product to eliminate cursing and excessive use of God's name that today's shows and movies use. It does a pretty good job of that, but IMO this product is NOT state of the art. This device does not support movies made by Universal, so if you are purchasing or renting a Rated R movie you better check the back of the movie to see who made it. Also, we have experienced some movies that weren't made by Universal that the guardian did not block. I think it still needs some refining and for a product over $100, it should do a better job. Finally, the setup is quite simple, but can get somewhat complicated if you use surround sound. The best option I've found is to have all devices attached to an A/V switch and then attach the A/V switch to the guardian. If anyone has other recommended setups i'd love to hear them! And and BTW, if you use nothing but HD, this product is not for you since it does not support the latest technology."
5,"Beautiful, simple story, and great on audio.","With watercolor illustrations, this spare story of a snowy day is an absolute pleasure. Sean Schemmel performs distinct voices on the audiobook, making it a wonderful companion to the award-winning book."
4,Beautiful illustrations,"While this is a beautiful book, the story didn't really engage my 4-year old granddaughter. It is fun to look for the snowflakes with her though."
4,A great resource!,"This book met a lot of my expectations by being very portable, very well-illustrated, and full of good descriptions of the merchandise one is likely to find in London and Paris flea markets. ""Antiquing"" is a very visual experience for me, and having plenty of photographs to whet my appetite for the various shops was a real plus. The book was useful too in helping me plot which days to attend which markets. Even if the merchandise changes and vendors sometimes move, there is enough general information that stays constant for this to be a useful guide for several years. The two-for-one format--London and Paris in one book--is also fun. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the maps could have been better. Otherwise, a great resource!"
5,Always a good read!,"Pendragon is the best series every written, fact! Once you read the first book you can't put the other 9 down."
3,Not as good as the previous 3 but still worth reading.,"I was slightly disappointed with ""The Reality Bug."" It seemed to start out slow and didn't get really exciting until somewhere the middle. I've come to care about the characters and felt almost obligated to press on, it's what kept me turning the pages in the beginning. I've really enjoyed this series and am really looking forward to the next adventure."
4,WOW... That's all I can say.(SMALL SPOILER BENEATH),"I have a love/hate relationship with this book. On one hand it's one of the most AMAZING scifi books I've ever read. On the other hand it's just sad.If you've been following the series you'll know that Bobby hasn't lost a territory yet. Well in this one he does. That's all I'm going to tell you. You'll just have to go and read it for yourself but be warned. It's not what you think it is.You find out really interesting things when you read this book. You also watch Bobby mature into a young man. He becomes solemn, tired, and worn out. This battle isn't about a little kid being a hero anymore. It's a real fight between good and evil and there's a chance that evil will win out in the end.Definitely one of the best, but also a very sad book."
2,"""growing away from me"" is lousy quality recording","don't buy this cd for ""growing away from me"" as the recording sounds like it was burned from an old album, lots of pops and crackling. surely they could have found a better source tape or cleaned it up."
4,Clean Up Your Room.,"Fritz is a little skunk who hates to clean, says he will do things then forgets, is a procrastinator, and gets in trouble a lot. Then one night after making a terrible mess and getting yelled at by his father, mother, and sister, Fritz is awaken by the Mess Fairy: a creature brought to life by Fritz's last minute science experiment. The Mess Fairy makes a mess bigger than anything Fritz ever could do. However, Fritz learns an important lesson through the experience and vows to be a little more cleanly in the future.The illustrations that accompany the text are good and children enjoy reading the story. I especially liked how the author used a skunk as the main character, playing with the way skunks naturally smell. This is a good story to read to children who have a difficult time picking up after themselves at home and makes a nice bed time story."
4,Loads of Power,I'm not sure how long this will last. Had it on for nearly ten hours straight and never saw the battery bar on the iPod dip below full charge. Used it for the next three days on and off for a total of maybe 6 hours and still didn't see any change in battery level. Would be nice if it came with a car charger if your traveling to the outdoors and won't have a pc to charge it through.
5,Great autobiography of Lester Levenson,"It's very difficult to rate this book. I've given it five stars because I loved it, but it's not for everyone's taste. Probably you won't get the most out of it until you've already learned something about Lester Levenson from the Sedona Method or other releasing techniques. I really wanted to know more about his life and I was glad to find an autobiography - not just something written by someone else. Lester's style is very simple but his words have tremendous power. However, if you're only looking for a self-help book this one is not for you; you'll find some parts boring, and it lacks the method itself. But if you've already heard about Lester and want to know more about him, then you'll love this one, go for it!!!."
3,Recommend audio recordings of Lester Levenson,"Lester Levenson is a wonderful inspiration, teacher, gnani. I would recommend purchasing his audio recordings available at the Sedona Method website. There are quite a number and they are enjoyable and helpful, repeatedly. Much of this book is taken verbatim from some of the audio recordings (thus, the book was a bit disappointing). His life story I have not found elsewhere, but nothing is added by way of elucidating his clarity and wisdom from, as he puts it, ""going free."" If you are interested in advaita vedanta, I highly recommend the audio recordings!"
5,Great Book,I've read it at least six times. The more I read the more I get out of it. He explains life to us in our own language. I now have a better understanding of what Jesus said in the Bible. Life makes more sense to me. It is a book that shows people how to empower themselves and take control of their lives. Stop blaming others and take responsibilty for your own actions. This empowers you to be able to change anything you don't like in your life. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
5,UN DISCO DE LO MEJOR,"Es un gran disco. Al oir las primeras canciones uno se da cuenta de la evolución que tiene el grupo. De lo mejor que hay en el mercado. Si lo ven, no lo piensen dos veces y comprenlo, no se arrepentiran. Todavía existen algunos grupos originales y que hacen musica de calidad, y KABAH es uno de esos grupos. Es el único grupo pop que no es prefabricado, hacen su música, escriben sus canciones y son ellos mismos, no como otros.Es bastante bueno y de los mejores."
5,Excellent read!!!,"I have just finished Daniel Maloney's Maverick Square!!! All I can say is ""astonishing""!!! Having been raised in Massachusetts and spending a great deal of time in Boston, I must say he has captured the flare and air of Boston and the New Englanders' life very well. Maverick Square is a twisting and turning account of the ordinary and not so ordinary life of ""Edmonds"", the main character in the book. The suspense and thrills of this tale will keep you on the edge of your seat and peaked with anticipation with the turn of each page. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and finished it in less than a 24 hour span. I assure you once you pick it up you will not be able to set it back down. It is filled to the brim with drama, humor, thrills, suspense, you name it!! It has it all. I highly recommend picking this up. It is well worth it and definately a great way to spend a weekend!!!"
1,Already rusty after 1 month!,"We just got this item a month ago and it's already rusty. The interesting thing is that it only rained 2 or 3 times. In their description it says ""To prevent rusting, the base should be protected from constant exposure to rain and moisture."" So, I guess you'll need to bring it inside any time it rains. Very convenient! What cheap garbage!"
4,Highly enjoyable,"Not prose-perfect, but neither are some of those internet-novels popping up in publication lately, and some of those are better than mainstream books. Even J.K. Rowling took her lumps from smug insiders who were coughing up sour grapes all over the place.Some characters are very well developed in The Magickers while others are semi-neglected. Adult characters at first were a little one dimensional. Some interesting ideas regarding magic, and it's obvious time and thought was put into it. I had a good time reading this. But they need to do something about those covers. They're atrocious and don't do the contents justice - everyone has receding hairlines and are wearing the latest in yuppie sportswear. Did the artist even read the books? Almost turned me off to the books until someone told me to read them."
4,So far so good!,"I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors!"
4,Kid's Cot,"We bought this cot for my 4-yr old son to sleep on when we go out of town. He loves it. It is easy to set-up and put away. The only negative comment I have is that the pad is thin. I wish it were a little thicker, but he doesn't seem to mind!"
3,They're just OK,"I bought two of these for my toddler twin grandchildren. I read other reviews that stated the bar in the middle seemed uncomfortable for sleeping. I agree. With the children in a toddler stage, this cot is just OK. Once the kids get bigger, I'm not so sure. Wouldn't want them to sleep on them for more than 2-3 nights in a row. OK for gramma sleepovers. The kids love them!"
2,"Nice, but...","The cot is great in size, but not very sturdy. The construction of the cot is not very strong to support the weight limit referenced in its description."
1,"Terrible, uncomfortable design!","This cot has a raised, 3-inch-wide support band that runs across the center width of the cot, right where the child's waist goes. Then the material drops lower above and below that band, so the child's upper body and lower body are literally 3 inches lower than the waist. It was so uncomfortable for our daughter that we bought an inflatable bed for her future travels after our first and only trip with the cot."
5,Super Convenient!,"We purchased this for our 2 year old grandson to keep at our house for when he visits. My daughter used to have to bring the pack & play over when our grandson stayed the night. It was bulky & a pain to put up & tear down, but this cot has proven to be super convenient & takes up very little storage space as it easily breaks down & fits in a bag like a folding chair. We love it, and so does our grandson, he doesn't feel like he's in 'jail' anymore! One side note, I plan on buying a piece of foam from a fabric store and cutting it to fit the cot for a little more cushion, as this cot really doesn't have much."
5,Great Purchase!,"My son is four years old and has been napping on this cot once a week at his grandparents house for almost two years now. It's one of the best investments I've made, especially at this price. We've even taken it on vacation with us. Once collapsed, it fits perfectly in our full sized suitcase. The fabric is sagging a little at this point, but I'm not surprised considering how much use it's gotten. I'll probably buy a replacement soon for my son, and another one for my daughter once she's too big for the playpen."
1,Not worth it,"This didn't even last a 2 weeks before one of the bars bent. My daughter said it wasn't comfy and she didn't sleep well at all. We gave it the dogs, as least they are enjoying it."
1,Bisecting strap,"I wish I had read the detailed reviews before purchase - I bought this as a travel bed for my nearly-18-month daughter. She adored it as a place to sit, but lying down on it was impossible because the strap that runs through the middle doesn't yield at all (leaving her with something digging into and raising her middle). We tried to open it out as much as possible, thinking extra tension on the rest of the cot would help, but it didn't. It would definitely require something like two pillows or a thick pad of some kind, which renders it useless to me because I would primarily be using it for the times when I travel alone with her and need to pack as lightly as I can manage. I am in the process of returning this."
2,not verry comfortable,"Bought this for the 2 yearold to sleep on when we went on vacation, Its handy that it folds up but the kid just slid around on it and fell off and there is no way this thing is comfy either."
1,terrible to sleep on!,"I got this for my 4 year old to sleep on when we traveled. I was excited and read all the reviews. But, I don't know why everyone is so excited about it! There may not be a bar in the middle, but there is still a band of fabric that goes across the middle which does not give with the rest of the bed; so the head and the end of the bed are lower than the middle. Very uncomfortable to sleep on. Although, my children had fun climbing and sitting on it. No good as a bed, great beach couch! I am returning it, and buying a blow up bed."
3,Simple and Compact,"I ordered this to use for my grand-daughter when my family arrives next month. It's light and packs up small when not in use. The sack material is thin, not very durable (had a missed seam on the bottom where an edge was missed when it was sewn together) and the drawstring is flimsy and without a locking device to keep it closed. The cot seems to be about the right size for a toddler, although there's a center strip that runs the width of the cot that might be uncomfortable, as it doesn't flex to the same degree that the cot material on either side of it does...it could have the same effect as a center bar on a larger cot. Time will tell if this works out okay."
4,Easy portable cot,"We bought this portable cot for road trips, and it has worked well. I did have to purchase a piece of foam from the fabric store to put between the cot and the cover, so the center bar wouldn't be poking my son as he slept. That basically doubled the price. It stores small enough that it's easy to travel with: easy to set up and take down. Would have preferred it to be a little larger so I could get more use out of it as my son just turned 3 and I doubt it will last a year before he outgrows it."
4,Good bed for daycare!,"We use this cot as a bed for my two year old's naps. She stays with my sister while I work and she got way too tall for sleeping in the pack n play. This cot folds up really easy and is very durable. My only complaint is that the cushion/cover could be a little more plush for comfort. Otherwise, the price was great and it works well for my daughter. She loves sleeping on her new ""big girl bed"" at Aunt Em's house. :)"
1,uncomfortable,I was hoping it was more comfortable than it looked but there is a bar across the middle that makes it very uncomfortable. It doesn't matter how portable it is if your child won't sleep on it and my 2 y/o won't.
3,Grandson,This is perfect for when my grandson spends the night. I added a sleeping bag on top of it to make it a little more comfortable for him. The size of the cot is perfect right now. I should get another year use of it before my grandson outgrows it.
2,almost awesome.,"The cot is easy to use and stores very easily. The big problem is the main support strap is right in the middle and it sticks into my daughters back so she cannot get comfortable. This makes the cot almost unusable. Just like the picture shown above, my daughter would curl up in a ball on one end of the cot. Once she gets just a little bigger, we'll have to use something else to travel with."
4,Sturdy Toddler/Pre-K cot!,"We bought two of these to take camping and our kids LOVE them.We also use them for sleepovers, in hotels, and for some naptimes. We've used them moderately for about 6 months, with no issues. Our 3-year-old is a very easy on hers, but our 5-year-old is rough on his and it's still going strong.PROS...It's inexpensive, literally sets up in SECONDS, folds away in SECONDS, and very portable.CONS...The center has a strip of nylon webbing to keep it from sagging into the support bar. But since the rest of the cot sags, it creates a firmer line in the middle. My kids don't even notice it, but other kids might be bothered.OTHER...For the negative reviews who say the cot is small...the measurements are available in the description! Obviously, if your child is taller then the cot (48"") then they won't fit. But if you need a portable or fold-away bed for a young child, this is a great investment!"
2,"Great thought, but could be better","I bought this for my neice while she was staying at my house. I loved the thought it could be used for both her and my son later on, but once I got it, there was belt that ran right in the center of the bed. I had to use a few blankets and to pad it up so it would be comfortable to sleep on. After the second day, my neice was asking her cousin if she could sleep in bed with her. I can't tell if it was because it was uncomfortable or if she just wanted to be with her cousin. I will be returning it. I will keep on looking for a better cot for my house."
2,Arrived Broken,"When looking to buy this product I read several reviews and I saw that a few complained that theirs arrived broken. But I was in need of an inexpensive travel bed for my son so I took a chance and guess what IT ARRIVED BROKEN! So for anyone else looking to buy this product, beware, you get what you pay for. Even if yours does not arrive broken it is cheaply made. It is a great concept poorly executed."
2,"Good concept, but. . . not comfortable","We bought this for our 3 year old when he outgrew the pack-n-play for trips. It's a great concept, very easy to transport, folds very small, and he loves it. But, after sleeping on it twice, he complained (the 3rd time) that it hurts his back (he weighed 31 lbs. at the time), and the cot had sunk a bit in the middle so that his back was right on the middle support bar. Like other posters here have written, the middle is up higher than the head and foot area, so it's very uncomfortable and digs into his back. We've done like the others have mentioned. . . put pillows and/or rolled up comforter underneath the entire cot (and over the brace) to make it all an even surface to sleep on, but it's a lot of trouble. We're going to sell it and buy a different cot. The design of this one needs to be reworked."
2,UGH!!!,"I ordered this product...and come to find out the packaging didn't have the braces. I ordered it because my daughter was going to spend the night at a friend's house, and yea...we didn't have a cot. Had to go to Target and buy one. NOT HAPPY!"
3,STRANGE HORROR COMEDY,"AFTER A COUPLE ELOPES THEY TAKE AN OLD HIGHWAY BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS IT'S A HIGHWAY TO HELL. AFTER THE WOMAN IS CAPTURED BY HELLCOP IT BECOMES AN ADVENTURE FILLED WITH ACTION, SUSPENSE AND A FEW CHEAP LAUGHS. BOTTOM LINE: BURNS UP A HELL OF A STORM."
5,As Real As It Gets,"The photo doesn't do it justice. The painted detail of this snake is remarkable and it is the first fake snake I've ever held that made me nervous.I bought it to keep birds off of my deck and out of my garden but yes, I admit it, I also had someone in mind that is terrified of snakes and it sure did the trick when I sprung it on them.The snake is in a realistic pose compared to most fake snakes and its head is reared up which helps make it realistic. This snake comes across more of like a biology prop than a rubber toy because it is so realistic."
4,Excellent variations!,"This book has many floor plans and exterior elevation renderings. It's variety is what makes it worth the purchase. The floor plans, however, are mostly main levels, leaving upper floors to your imagination."
5,Very good for my dogs,This training collar is a very good and usefull to do activities with my dogs. Recomendable to train and love dogs.
3,Fits nice but hard to change size,Fits nice on my dog but adjusting the size is more difficult than I thought. The rope use seems cheap but so far has not shown any signs of tearing. Which I'm thankful for!
3,Training Collar,"I like the collar, in theory. However, we have an 8 month old Chocolate Lab and the collar didn't seem to phase him. We made sure the placement was correct - higher on the neck and behind the ears, but he was able to sneak out of it a few times actually. Luckily, he isn't a runner. If you are looking for a training collar that is more aggressive, go with the metal options."
4,training collar,This is an effective collar but the snap for putting on and taking off is difficult. The directions say not to slip over the dogs head but I do (carefully) because the snap is too hard for my hands.
2,Not effective,I have an active 9 month old border collie that can be difficult to control on walks. This collar seems to be made well but it is not effective unless it is placed in the right position around his neck. To be effective on my dog I must place the collar up high on his neck. That means I have to constantly adjust it since it keeps sliding down. When it is in the correct position it does help control my dog's pulling but with the constant adjusting it isn't worth it for me. Possibly this collar would work better on short hair dogs.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased this product because it seemed more humane than a prong collar. I have no idea how well it works, I didn't get far enough to try it. It has to be taken apart to be put on/off the dog. It's incredibly awkward and difficult to take it apart; that alone makes it unusable. I hate the idea of trying to snap it off while it's on the dog. This is a really bad piece of designTriple Crown Large Dog Training Collar (large 21'' adjustable collar).On top of it all, they won't let me return it, a little detail that's somewhere on the page but not easy to find."
1,Misleading Advertisement,"What you see on Tv or what you read about this collar is alot different than the results you get for the most part. My dog has alot of fur around his neck so it doesnt work so great. Its USELESS as far as trying to keep my dog from jumping up on people, or stopping him from pulling. He still pulls, not always as bad but it doesnt stop him when he has his mind set on something. As far as putting it on him-- RRIIIGHHT---- What a joke! If you can manage to Not get your dog to move for 2 minutes, maybe, but good luck with that! Its a pain in the### to get on him. I honestly stopped using it because its so frustrating trying to get it on his neck. You cant just slide it on or off your dog, you have to mess with it and twist and turn it until it snaps on or off. I could see it working if you have a tiny dog, but on anything bigger-- good luck! I wouldnt reccomend this product to ANYONE!"
2,Get the metal collar!!,"IF YOU NEED A PINCH COLLAR FOR YOUR DOG, GET THE METAL ONE!!!! I put this plastic one on my dog and on our first walk the nylon tie broke!! I had to chase my puppy for over half a mile to catch her again. I couldn't believe it!!! I threw this piece of crap away and bought a metal one with the plastic tips on them. I didn't want something too sharp, because I don't want to be cruel...but my husky was bred to pull. Not so great for walking on a leash. Buying this plastic ""training collar"" only TAUGHT ME to quit trying to save a few bucks because sometimes a few more dollars will buy you something that actually works, AND DOESN'T BREAK ON THE FIRST USE!!!!!"
2,Didn't work on my Lab 65lb Dog,"I was hoping this would work for my 8 month 65lb pound Lab. He is a very hyper pup, so I'm not sure if its the product or just him, but it didn't work at all for him."
4,"High energy, fun tunes","A decent double-album, almost entirely instrumental. It's high-energy, bright pop-rock featuring electric guitar leads. Don't look for crunchy dark chord sequences or lots of minor notes, but if you want some fun, upbeat tunes this isn't bad."
4,Like this? Don't miss his work with Carla Olson!,"Too Hot For Snakes, The Ring Of Truth, Within An Ace, Reap The Whirlwind - all great Carla Olson albums featuring Mick on anywhere from 3 to all the tracks. Of special interest, the title cut of Within An Ace which very well just might be about Mr Taylor, perhaps?"
5,Spiritually moving,Awesome videos and wonderful music. I love the Creation song is a beautiful piece and I can't think of a better song that explains the story of Jesus than When love sees you.
5,The Art of Bel Canto,"This recording was recommended to me by an outstanding voice teacher in NYC who told me that Eileen DiTullio was ""a great singer."" That turned out to be an understatement!! Every track on this recording is a lesson in the art of bel canto--beautiful legato, amazing range, delicate colorings, quicksilver mood changes, and all done without any forcing of the tone or unnatural darkening of the voice. Imagine a blend of the best qualities of Beverly Sills, Benita Valente, and Judith Raskin and this will give you an idea of the timbre of the voice. Ms. DiTullio stands alone in her artistry, total command of her voice, and the ability to touch one's heart with the sheer beauty of her expression."
5,a must see,"a photoshop owner with a terminal disease met a traffic police woman, and they started to fall in love, and they only knew each others' workspace. you must watch the movie to find out the ending. But I am not sure where the ""christmas"" part came from..."
5,A Very Gentle Movie,"I had a few friends recommend this movie to me. Several rated it as their favorite Korean film. I can understand why.I really liked it. I have bought one for myself and gave one as a gift.The movie centers around a man suffering from cancer (a terminal disease) who meets and forms a bond with a young woman. Their relationship goes beyond romance to the real essence of love.It is a worth while movie to watch. It has an insight into human relationships rarely seen in US cinema.The actors are two of Korea's most popular. The performance make the movie, what it is, a little gem. : )"
2,It's okay but would not purchase another,The mitten received was kind of cute but it was not knitted very well and the knitting thread used feels cheap. I would not buy another set.
1,This book is extremely difficult to understand.,"Excellent teaching guides are easy to read and understand. They're fun and only heighten interest in learning. Programming in Modula-3:An Introduction in Programming with Style by Laszlo Boszormenyi and Carsten Weich is NO INTRODUCTION. They're explanations are difficult to follow. In addition, it fails to enlighten the reader. I would not recommend this book to a fellow student or programming hobbiest who's just looking to learn a little bit more about Modula-3. I'm disappointed there aren't more Modula-3 programming books."
4,Good Live Set & New Songs Plus Covers,"I don't know what the one bad reviewer was talking about. He is obviously not a fan and not smart enough to listen to the CD at a listening station before buying or listening to tracks first on this site.With addition of BONO, how could this CD go wrong? If you love the CORRS, you'll love this album."
2,What happened to my review?,"I read ""Come Near Me"" and was intensely disappointed in the plot and characters. Halfway through the book I couldn't think of a single reason why I should continue through to the finish. I reviewed this book and the review has not been posted. Why?"
5,Been using this product for years,"I started using this years ago, in my very early 50's and never have had even one brown spot on my hands. I am now going on 65 and still have the hands of a 25 year old woman. This is wonderful stuff. I don't care what it has in it, I will continue to use it because it works !!!! No one wants the aging ugly brown spots on their hands. I am starting to use it on my face as well. Great product !!!!"
4,A rare find!,"From a rock trio that toured the south in the late 70's, this is a prize in my collection. All of the songs I find pleasing, talented and not overbearing."
2,"OK, but pump doesn't work","I think / hope this is original and not a knock-off; it definitely smells like Sunflowers and is very long-lasting, however the pump didn't work so it kind of spills all over when I apply it, quite wasteful and annoying."
3,"Cute, but Chicago is better.","Its quite rare, but in this case the newer version is actually much better. If you have seen Chicago, you can see where they drew their inspiration, but this is not nearly as good as the newer film. This film is like a watered down, slapstick version. It is supposed to take place in 1927, but the clothing looks suspiciously 1940's. Even though I like Ginger Rodgers, I much prefer Renee Zelweger as Roxie, Rodger's character is almost annoying. Adoplh Menjou makes an interesting Billy Flynn, but can not beat Richard Gere by far."
4,Roxie Hart,"Please note that 4 stars is my review of the movie not the seller or his service. I would give the seller 5 stars for prompt response and service. Again, I would be very happy to do business with this seller again."
1,Useless,This book is not about Windows 95. It is about how to get your organization to buy into converting to Windows 95. Total waste of money.
5,"UMMMM, VANILLA BEANS",I WAS THRILLED TO RECEIVE MY ORDER OF TAHITIAN VANILLA BEANS SO I COULD START COOKING MY CUSTARDS AND BAKE!
2,whats the deal???,"Ok this kinda makes me mad. I really always loved goof troop. It really makes me mad how disney has only released 1 dvd and it only contains three episodes. Its called volume 1. So where is volume 2?? its only been what like 4 years since this one was released? i dont get why they cant just release boxed sets like they have chip n' dale, duck tales, tale spin or darkwing duck."
5,so thoughtful. . .,A wonderfully thoughtful book that approaches this difficult and complicated topic from a truly loving perspective. A must-read for anyone contemplating beginning or expanding a family.
3,Reassuring but repetitive,"This book has some useful information in it, and I like how it emphasizes using your gut instinct and not feeling bad about your choices. But it could have been half the length, as so much is repeated. I skimmed it for the true birth stories in italics--they were more interesting than being reminded for the thousandth time that you could choose the birth that's right for you. But, an encouraging book for a first-time mother who's a little spooked of labor."
5,"Consumer friendly, readable, terse and quick","Since so many of these guides tell you what to do, it is such a relief to find one that asks you what you want to do and tries so hard to find the answer for you as a consumer. This book is so reader-friendly, so easy to use, and so focused on the unusual question of what's best for you as a consumer, I would call it the best I've found. Go here first. If you want more detail, you can easily find it, but to get the full picture of the incredible adventure you're about to enter, this is the first place to go."
4,"Not Preachy, Just Supportive","The recurring message in the book is that YOU are the one who is best able to make birthing choices for yourself. I like that the authors don't push one method over another. We pregnant women hear so many stories about delivery. This book reminds you that during labor, you will still be you--only in a more heightened state--so go with options that fit the type of person you (already) are when creating your birth plan. Good over-view of options and choices to think about ahead of time."
3,Quite Good,"I'm a student of Theoretical Physics, I used this book in my course of Modern Physics, the book is quite good in its explanation, but in the exercises it do not develop the kind of problems that is required for this kind of Physics, is the same problem with the majority of the american authors (in physics) they don't like to work and develop problem with complex mathematics, its is so simple that even a boy of first grade can solve them (not that kind of simple, you just understand to what I refer). It is good, but not excelent."
5,Another must have!,"It is true that this book has its weak points, but I have taken a modern physics course using this book, and I was enlightened and fascinated with the material this book is composed of. In fact, this book was an invaluable reference for a later course I took in physics, so it is surely a must have for reference. If you're a student preparing to continue with physics, this is a must have book. It'll help send you on your way."
3,Just OK,The quality of this DVD is very good. I wish Ian Anderson would not try to get fancy with the old classics. They were great songs when they recorded them why try and be artistic with them now. I also wish he would have done more of the classics and less of the unknown.
4,A Sorcerer Hunter's Happiness,"Okay. This tape was a little different from the first tape. The first episode was more like they get a vacation and it's at that beach. It was little sad, because Carrot was used by a girl. The next episode is sad too. Carrot met this girl named Lake, but I don't want to give the flat line. The last episode is where they have another mission asigned by Big Momma. It was about the love bewteen a brother and a sister. Also Marron gets a little scary near the end. It was the different from the first volume, because there weren't those little looking triangle things on the socerer's foreheads, but there really was only one sorcerer in the whole tape. It's funny as the first one, oh yeah, and Carrot gets hit on the head alot. You got to get this tape. You'll enjoy it!"
4,"Believable, engaging characters; great setting for a crime","I couldn't disagree more! Pearce continues to be one of the cleverest, funniest mystery writers I've read. Perhaps it helps that I've been to and love Egypt. He captures the bureaucracy beautifully. The Mamur is such a likable person. I look for characterizations and settings first, plot second. But I even think the plot of this one is lively!"
2,Get some at walmart instead,I bought this with my camera and I guess I didnt realize I could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price. My bad. But I would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $14 on one tape.
1,"Childishly edited, I'm betting","I read two chapters of the sample and compared to 120 Days of Sodom, it reads like it was edited for those with virgin ears. Sodom was brutal and was rather archaic. This is modern and in the second chapter Justine is clearly molested, but the scene is watered down.Another reviewer suggests you buy Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom and Other Writings. It's all one book and comes with essays written about Sade.I wouldn't buy this one."
4,I read Boomer's Journal. It was very descriptive and good.,Boomer's Journal was a very good book. You can really get interested in it. I thought it was a pretty short book but I am a fast reader so it might have not been that short. I have read it two times and plan to read it again. I am usually am pretty picky on witch books are good but this one is excellent!
2,CRAPP,"I CAN SUM THIS ALBUM UP IN ABOUT 2 WORDS : ANAL EXCREMENT...(IT SUCKED)...SUBPAR PRODUCTION, COUPLED WITH BEATS THAT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD, AND A ""LYRICAL PIONEER"" LIKE PR TERRORIST. I PUT LYRICAL PIONEER IN QUOTES BECAUSE THATS NOT MY OPINION BUT THATS HOW HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF. THERE IS A LOT OF ILL RAPPERS FROM PUERTO RICAN HERITAGE LIKE OUTERSPACE, AND KINGSYZE, BIG PUN...BUT THIS GUY SHOULD BE FLOGGED AND KILLED."
4,We Are The Romani People,"Ian Hancock teaches Romani studies at the University of Austin Texas, and writes voluminously on the Romani people, their history and their customs. This book, which the 'blurb' says is 'primarily a source book for teachers, social workers and others interacting with Romanies' is also useful for anyone wishing to know more about the Gypsy/Romani people. The book includes chapters on their origins, their cuisine, their language, the persecution of the Romanies (still continuing today), and the 'Porrajmos' a.k.a. the Gypsy Holocaust. It's a thorough and easy to read book for anyone interested in the Romanies."
4,It's DEFINITELY Abel's sound,"High energy, heavy dance sound. I enjoy Abel immensely, and in particular, his building fantastic climaxes when he spins circuit parties (especially the Coliseum Party @ Gay Disney, Snow Ball, & his New Year's parties). My two mild disappointments with this (which afflict many other DJ dance compilations) are 1) many of the adlibs that live DJs mix in to add color & texture (often from FIERCE bootleg white labels) are absent, and 2) the gradual build up to climax isn't really present. There are clear highs and lows and lots of tempo & volume variation to keep it fun, but the energy of this CD doesn't quite capture the magic of Abel live. However, it's a close enough approximation of his live performances that this CD is nevertheless one of my current favorites. Accordingly, I recommend it highly to dance/circuit-party aficionados, and anyone else who's a fan of ""celebration"" sounds."

3,You call this a volume?,"Three episodes? THREE?I loved this cartoon as a child, so not complaining about that. I still love it.However, only three episodes? Disney, that's just shameful."
1,Downright creepy & inappropriate for kids,"Our 6 year old received this as a Christmas gift. We pulled it out part-way through during a scene where one of the ducks, while secretly spying on girl-duck cheerleaders, makes comments about a fantasy life regarding cheerleaders.The voyeuristic quality and sexual connotations would be troubling even for an adolescent audience, but that this is meant for a very young audience is a bit unsettling. Bad form, Disney."
3,OK Mints that could be stronger,I purchased these mints from Amazon hoping to find a level below altoids in strength. I was kind of disappointed. These mints are VERY VERY weak in flavor. I am used to stronger mints and in some ways I can barely tell anything is there. BUT - if you think Altoids are suicidally strong and want a more subtle mint - look no further - these are the mints you are looking for. If you are looking for something strong or having a strong spearmint flavor move along - nothing to see here.
1,It's Garbage,"I don't write reviews but I want to save someone from making a BIG mistake. The first time I used this camera was in Tahiti and after two rolls of film, it broke. I took it back to Circuit City and got another. I used one roll over Christmas and took it too Egypt. This new one broke after the third roll and I haven't used it since. Who cares about the warranty? What a waste of money - I certainly don't want to have another one of these. I am now using my old reliable 10-year-old camera and am sucking up the expense. But I also don't have pictures of Tahiti and Egypt. Am I supposed to carry two cameras in case this one doesn't work? Never again Minolta will you get my money. It's not the money for the camera but the trip pictures to places I will probably never go again. Thanks for the memories - not."
2,"Disappointed by the ""Thread of TIme""",Thread of Time: The Best of the Music of EnyaThe CD wasn't at all what I expected. The music sampler didn't provide enough for me to make a judgemtn as to whether I would like to buy the CD and the reviews were no help at all. I would gladly dump the CD except I have money tied up in it. I will try to give it away but I would not hoist it on anyone.
1,Dreadful elevator muzak,The only reason this works at all is because the underlying music is beautiful. A travesty. Yuck
3,Fast and Quiet but...,"This kettle boils very quickly and is incredibly quiet. You generally get what you pay for but I'm stunned that there's no way to shut the kettle off (other than unplugging it) - not good if you only want hot, not boiling, water. For this reason alone I'd look at alternatives..."
2,Not the best by a long shot,"Frankly, this is very overated recording, as is the so-called legendary Gulini. Best in my view are a) Josef Krips (Decca) and Mitropoulos (Sony Classics). The latter is live, which this opera can take and in fact it adds to the frisson and excitement particularly in the final act. And the singers. Nobody has yet bettered Grummer, or Della Casa as Donna Anna or Donna Elivira. Hear them and you won't be able to listen to others doing this opera. The sound for a 1956 recording is excellent as is the Krips one which was recorded around 1959. In both recordings Siepi is the Don and his voice is a marvellous mixture of suave, erotic and downright sinister. In short he encompases the whole role. Do yourself a favour and get BOTH these recordings."
2,"Fascinating Subject, Dull Treatment","Though a longtime Shakespeare buff, I'm relatively new to the Authorship controversy, and find it fascinating. I've read a couple of Shakespeare biographies without having any idea how little documentation the standard story is based upon.This book, though, should greatly cheer those who wish the whole thing would go away. As introduction to the mystery, its hard to imagine a drier laundry list of evidence and candidates, written without a spark of insight or wit. Apparently the great selling point here is the author's objectivity, but this is taken to such absurd lengths that it starts to feel like a put on.And most damagingly, in his vague weighing of arguments, the author gives no indication of having a personal familiarity with Shakespeare's work -- if he has read and enjoyed the plays in any capacity aside from solving this mystery, he gives no indication of it here."
4,Nice tea pot!,"I just received this tea pot. It seems like great quality, but the tea pot came with the black handle unattached and there is no easy way to attach it that we can find. Not sure if it is supposed to come attached and this is an error, or what."
1,Solutions manual - too many errors,"I bought this book thinking that it would help me verify the answers, but in fact there are too many errors in the book. I have found a lot of problems out of sequence, and a lot of them not properly done. I have contacted the author to mention about the errors but haven't heard from him yet."
3,Half finished work of a wise man,"This book brings back the memory of the ""Blind men and an elephant"": Von Neumann was a very wise man but totally blind to how the brain works. I feel he ""kind of"" admits this in his introduction, and as the year was 1957, no one can criticize his effort. Nevertheless, forty years later this book does not deserve much attention: Von Neumann died before finishing it and I really feel that he did not have enough time to provide more than anecdotes to how the brain and the computer can be compared. Three stars for historical value."
3,You may never go plant shopping again.,"Here is a movie that plant lovers will hate. Entertaining on many levels, for for adults only, the movie parodies a host of plays, movies and TV shows. There are worse movies to kill a few hours with. A boy and his plant."
2,It's just what you get for the price :(,The device didn't last 4 minutes of continuous operation.Pros:- Low price- Easy setupCons:- Unreliable connection- Low range (sitting your computer or mobile device right next to it may work)- Sensitive to interference from other wireless devices such as Cordless phones.- Poor troubleshooting documentation
2,Issues with Installation and Connectivity,"I believe the negative aspect of the product is more important for the readers, the package included with an installation guide and a CD. I was unable to install it myself even I followed the instructions given. I had to spend lots of time to get this install; finally I got help from the customer service and go it installed. The customer service was fairly good and they gave totally different steps for installation. I think they better include those steps as the installation guide. I know for sure, if I have to install this again, I need customer service help. There is no continuous connectivity, after one or two days I always have to reboot the router. I'm disappointed with this product and do not recommend for others."
2,Bad router!,"The router stops frequently, have to restart or reset, the signal is bad too, would not recommend to friends! go buy a refurbished one of better quality!"
3,Not bad... just not very good either,"This router is a great value if you're in a hurry to get things set up on a budget. That being said, it only lasts about 6 months before going totally nonresponsive... (as in, you can no longer access the router from your computer... the only feature that works is auto setup. So your router will continue to transmit a signal.. unsecured... so if you're fine with your neighbors using your broadband to stream netflix, this is the router for you. If not, read on.) I've worked in IT for many years, and the reliability for this particular router definitely comes up short. Like I mentioned, its good to start with for $24, but make sure you save up for another better one in six months or less..."
1,soooo slow,This thing is so slow i can not watch a video on my itouch even when I'm right next to it
2,OK product. Could have been better and simpler,The product has far too complicated setup process. The product itself worked well enough after all the steps in the setup.
4,No Problem WAP,"I purchased this for a wireless access point for the kids' Wii and Gameboys, the $25 price tag being cheaper than other options. Very easy to set up and use - I've never even looked at the CD. The quick-start steps: plug it into the LAN, disable DHCP, give it an IP address etc, WEP security, set Transfer rate to 2 MBS (for the gameboys), and everything works without further fuss. I'm sure it would handle the routing, DHCP and other LAN chores if necessary.It's been running about three weeks so far with no issues. I recommend it.A year and a half later and the router is still serving its purpose without failure. I don't even get intermittent disconnects."
2,"Value for money, nothing fancy","I was very confused about getting a good router, considered many options ranging from Linksys to Netgear to Belkin (I previously had a Belkin, it was an epic fail). I found out about Trendnet, it was way cheaper and served my purpose of a normal day-to-day router. It doesn't really have as many functions as a high-end consumer router, but it is well-suited for home usage. If you are running a small business from home, for example, you do not want to get this. My experience with cheap products in the past has almost entirely been bad, but this one has yet to disappoint me. I would predict the longevity of this router to be about a year. All in all, it's good value for the money. Especially if you're just interested in setting up a basic home network with up to 4 devices connected at a time."
1,I wouldn't buy this again.,I bought this for my mom and its horrible. We are constantly having to restart it or reset it. It doesn't ever want to work. I should have the belkin one for her like I bought for myself.
4,Decent for the money.,"It's easy and cheap. Not the greatest about recovering from interrupt signals, but it's not easy to find a router at this price that is. It's kind of an eye sore with the bright hideous case...but if you need a cheaper router that's decent."
1,furious,I HATE IT! REAL PIECE OF CRAP. WORKED AFTER INITIAL SET UP. BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET AFTER THAT. I'VE ALREADY BOUGHT ANOTHER ROUTER TO GET RID OF THIS ONE. I'LL NEVER GO CHEAP AGAIN!
1,Cripple-Ware... Forces Wireless Network to be Public Unless Bribed,"I recommended AGAINST buying this product.The software as shipped has important functionality limited to the initial ""trail"" period of 30-days. DO NOT ACCEPT having a router that refuses to do MAC detection and refuses to hide its name unless you pay it more money.Overall, I paid what the trendnet asked for a combined software and hardware product. I expect it to work without further purchase. It should not force me to be unable to make VOIP calls because I must share my local area network with my neighbor who wants to download movies or watch youtube videos at my expense."
4,Works great,"the router works great for me. Except when I installed it, it kept telling me that my modem was connected when it actually was. So it said installation failed. But when I tried to log on to the network, it worked fine. Strange, but no other problems."
2,Unreliable,"This router drops connection at least once a day, very irritating.You have to unplug the power and plug again to get it working again."
2,keep dropping connection after one year,the first year was okay. connection dropped once in a month or so. had to put it in an air conditioned room in hot summer. now it starts to drop frequently. I totally have no idea why it is doing this. Have to replace it with a new one.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased this router because I couldn't afford an expensive router at the time. It started off good, but after about a month it started losing connection with my cable router occasionally. Now it constantly loses connection, and it's frustrating to constantly have to reset it. The one reason I gave this 2 stars is because it does have good signal strength when it works. I would not recommend this product, and I will be replacing it asap."
5,A Richly Textured Debut,"Don't let the simple name or cover photo fool you. The debut album by this New Jersey native is filled with satisfying and richly textured music(or dare I say compositions). Often compared to David Cousins of Strawbs fame, Sedan understands that there is a thin line between insight and pretentiousness. His string arrangements never cloud but enhance the music. Sedan is pretty good with a hook as well. On the opening track ""SKY"" the build up to the guitar creschendo is addictive. The second track ""WALK WITH PURPOSE"" is inspiring. The lyrics to ""PATRONS"" are clever and are worth a read even without the music accompanyment, but then again the music enhances them. When the last piano notes of ""WINTERS COLD"" fade away we are left hoping that spring brings more music from this talented new artist."
3,emotionally impoverished beginnings...,"gritty, tough, moving. the real story is that the author overcame countless barriers and achieved/surpassed what some would say, unrealistic goals."
2,It's not all that great...,"I got this CD because I am a pretty big fan of Sonic Mayhem,and thought that SM did a bunch of tracks for this soundtrack. To mydisappointment, they only did one song, track no. 2 titled""Confrontation."" It's a really hard, heavy-metal version ofthe James Bond Theme, it's really great, and I was hoping the wholesoundtrack would be like this. But the rest of the soundtrack is notheavy-metal... Like I said, SM only did this one track, and the wholerest of the CD is decent, but nothing worth forking up $13.00 topurchase it..."
3,Why This Game?,"I agree, this CD has some coolness to it. But overall, why couldn't they make a soudntrack out of Agent Under Fire? or Nightfire? Both of those scores are superior and deserve recognition."
2,map is not worth buying,the map has the main roads only that every travel book or some web pages have as well. Lonely Planet book has beter maps.
1,Rage Theology,"I was very disappointed by this book. I thought it would be serious, scholarly study of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Judaism. Instead, it is a ranting, raving, endless criticsm of just about everything the Catholic Church stands for. Invective is not an argument. The cloying autobiographical passages in which the author offers up his strange blend of new Age theology and old-fashioned anti-Catholicism are incredibly sophomoric---and incredibly long-winded.This is a tantrum, not a scholarly history."
4,Provocative,"Thoughtful, well-written history of the evolution of Christianity from the time of Christ, including the origins and legacy of millenia of Christian anti-Semitism. Formed as a pre-Vatican II Catholic (I'm 63), I found the book particularly provocative. I also found the book to be a solid reminder of the dangers of having religion too closely engaged with the state.My negative: he got a little too obtuse for me at times, stretching too far to connect what seem to me to be relatively inconsequential historical events to profound changes in the course of the history he relates."
1,Pride and Prejudice,"Having pioneered the anti-Catholic novel (Prince of Peace) and the anti-Catholic autobiography (An American Requiem), the excommunicated author now provides us with an anti-Catholic documentary.The ""history"" here is easy to dismiss. The author simply focuses on the apparently anti-Semitic statements of Catholics over the centuries and discards the many Catholic condemnations of anti-Semitism. The hatchet job on Pius XII and Pius XII, clear and early opponents of Nazi racism, is nothing short of libel.The author's constant interruption of the narrative by his own lachrymose musings on his troubles with the Church and the bizarre conclusion, where he demands that the Catholic Church abandon its most basic beliefs, reveals the bias fueling the entire sad enterprise.Is an anti-Catholic soap opera next?"
3,constantine's sword by carroll,"i thought there was a lot of good info in this book & it does a good job of documenting how the church inadvertently, maybe, set the stage of discrimination of the jews in history including the worst of it all, the holocost; i am not a member of any church now but i do remember growing up after WWII having the jews being referred to as the christ killers by many of my relatives who were members of the same church & this was shortly after WWII with the holocost still fresh in peoples minds; people who would not like to hear that argument will not want to read this book but i thought the read worthwhille"
1,Hatchet,"This is yet another piece of fashionable anti-Catholicism disguised as a piece of history. The author claims to ""love his Church deeply,"" but how this love ended up in this ex-priest being excommunicated from his church is never explained.The technique of denigrating the church is simple. Catholicism is a huge religion with millions of adherents. Choose only those church documents that appear to have a trace of anti-Semitism and then claim that Catholics are (surprise!) anti-Semitic. Suppress all the documents that are pro-Semitic and your case is made. But this dishonest technique can prove anything: Catholics are anti-abortion and pro-abortion, libertine and Puritan, anti-slavery and pro-slavery, left, right, center, vegetarians or carnivores. Take your pick.This is a sad and self-hating piece of work."
4,anyone have a better explantion?,"If Carroll set out to provoke, antagonize, irritate, anger and spark debate, he has succeeded. What makes this book important is the reaction it has generated. For this alone, the book needs to be read...One can only ask, ""Does anyone have a better explanation for the centuries of anti-Semitism?"
3,"Great subject, good history, overwrought conclusions","This is a timely, important book. The subject of this book is the devastating effect of Christianity on Jews as far as the actions of the Catholic Church. Protestants can read in the actions of their own churches and both will find his discussions of the Gospels provocative. Making the effort to overlook his ""Boomer academic"" conclusions is well worth it for any serious student of the Bible and anyone involved in religious education."
1,Stunning,"This is a stunning work of scholarship.The author very effectively unmasks Catholic anti-Semitism by discussing contraception, women priests, his favorite restaurants in Jerusalem, why he dislikes his father, the war in Vietnam, and how he'd like to rewrite the Bible.He doesn't sully his hands with working with texts in original languages or in dusty archives. If he doesn't like some Church condemnation of anti-Semitism (like Mit Brennender Sorge of Pius XI), he just ignores it. If his material is thin, he just makes up quotes, like the obvious howler he attributes to John XXIII.This is stunning scholarship.How dare any of these reviewers imply that this defrocked, excommunicated prist is anti-Catholic!"
1,In sheep's clothing,"Like the recent works of Gary Wills and John Cornwell, this book appears to be a critique of the Catholic Church's misuse of power toward the Jews. But this tendentious book is not really about that subject.It's just another self-hating jeremiad by an embittered Catholic who wants his church to be just like that nice liberal, all-inclusive church down the street: no moral laws, no dsiciplinary rules, no clams about salvation. Just sweet and light, as the Boston Globe editorial page defines sweet and light.."
1,Jaundiced,"This work is not a plausible chronicle of the Catholic Church's position on Judaism. The writer distorts the Church's record by omitting many significant Church condemnations of anti-Semitism.A much more objective account of the history of Catholic attitudes toward the Jews is presented by the Jewish historian Heinrich Graetz in his History of the Jews.Graetz concludes his work: ""It is remarkable that the bishops of Rome, the recognized champions of Christianity, treated the Jews with the utmost toleration and liberality. The occupants of the papal throne shielded the Jews and exhorted the clergy and princes against the use of force in convertin them to Christianity."""
1,Half the story,"I must agree with most reviewers of the book that this is a dishonest take on history.One example among others: Carroll cites Edith Stein's famous letter in 1933 asking the pope to condemn Nazi anti-Semitism. But he nowhere cites the encylical letter of Pius XII, Mit Brennender Sorge (1937), that condemns Nazi racism and that defends the supreme value of the Hebrew bible.The book is so full of tendentious anti-Catholic distortion of the history that the honesty of the author must be questioned."
1,Ain't PoMo Great?,"You don't have to follow those stuffy old rules, like proper use of sources--heck, make up your own rules! It's a free country, man. Get used to it.It's called advocacy scholarship. It goes like this: If justice is on your side, it's perfectly OK to play with the facts. A whole new generation of ""scholars"" has arisen using this methodology. Some of the more honest ones, like John Dominic Crossan, admit it. Some of the more dishonest ones, like John Boswell and Elaine Pagels--and James Carroll--don't. Why should they? They're plenty of [people] who'll buy their specious scholarship.Let's not play games. This book is despicable. It almost makes you wish the Vatican would revive its Index of forbidden books. It'd save us all a lot of time, energy, and grief wasted plowing through such nonsense."
1,Untruthful,"The book claims to be a history of the relationship between Catholics and Jews, but it doesn't meet the first criteria of serious historical work. It does not use primary sources. Rather, it uses secondary sources often drawn from anti-Catholic journalists. As a professional historian of the Middle Ages, I was appalled at how Carroll systematically ignores or explains away the many clear condemndations of anti-Semitism by popes, councils, and theologians. It is astonishing to read his criticism of Pius XI with no reference at all to his anti-Nazi and vigorously pro-Semitic encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge and numerous other solemn condemnations of anti-Semitism.This is not history. It is pure anti-Catholic fantasy for the lesiured classes."
1,Resentment,"The author's attack on the Catholic church is not serious.He seriously distorts the Church's record on anti-Semitism. Astonishingly he simply ignores well-known statements by Pius XI and Pius XII against anti-Semitism. One would never know from reading this book how the French, Dutch, Italian, British, and American bishops denounced the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.The real issue, of course, is not the Church and the Jews. It's the attempt of an angry ex-priest to denigrate his church by libel."
1,Correction of Correction,"For what it's worth, James Carroll is indeed excommunicated. In his earlier autobiographical works, he openly discusses his feelings toward his excommunciation. He was excommunicated when he married his wife without proper dispensation from his promise of clerical celibacy. You can disagree with this church policy, but Carroll has always acknowledged that his religiously invalid marriage involved the penalty of excommunication. We should all pray for this tragic man."
2,catholic guilt reheated,"Most of this book is just about how christian antisemitism(ie: the Crusades)is more responsible for the deaths of jews than the Death camps of WWII. I think we knew that. And how the church failed to respond all along... ditto.God's ""people"" whether they were Jews, Christians Muslims or whatever have NEVER been able to live up to his calling in their own.. which is what they have tried. All failed equally, but the author is an ex-priest so he came to see his ""Fathers"" part as worse than those that went before.So what should we do; roll in the guilt of our fathers as he does in this book. There's very little history and no exposition of what's there. It's just there to support his moral theses.The rest of the book is a psychoanalysis of his growing up looking at his mother's ankles and such."
5,Great Album,I love Men of Standard. This albums is worth your money. They need to get back together and do some more CD s
3,Maybe Next Time.....,"To me this c.d. was a big let down. I only like maybe two or three songs off of the whole album. I've been trying really hard to grow to like more of them, but it just hasn't happened for me yet. On the song ""Closest Friend,"" the intro happens to be the exact same intro that another familiar gospel group once used in one of their songs. It's okay to admire other groups, but don't forget who ""you"" are."
5,A Holiday Classic almost complete,"With the exception of only two songs missing, the Osmond Christmas Album has finally been done the right way. I just received the CD in the mail today, and it was great to relive some of my favorite childhood holiday memories. The artwork on the CD cover, Tray Card and inside cover match the original artwork of the original Christmas Album. The 1991 US release did not do this classic justice. One other note that is worth mentioning, I was happy to hear the ORIGINAL VERISON of Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells without Marie singing as released in 1991. The oringinal was only the Osmond Brothers singing, and is the version on this release. I highly recommend paying the extra for this version over the 1991 US release!"
3,"Beware, this was written in 1991!","I bought this book as I am concerned about eating right. I guess I was a little lazy and didn't check when it was written. If you are looking for an Indian cookery book, it's not too bad. If you are looking for recipes that are heart healthy, this may not be it. Understanding of diet and nutrition has improved a lot in the past decade. Eating grains and thus more carbs is not necessarily the best course of option. Buyer beware!"
1,deceptive picture and product...,"I purchased the Pachmayr Slip on recoil pad shown in the picture...Shown is a Slip on Pachmayr Decelerator Recoil Pad, the product that was shipped to me is not what is shown in the picture, it is a Pachmayr Slip on Recoil Pad but isn't the Decelerator shown in the picture....If you are purchasing one of these be aware that the product shown in the picture is misrepresenting the actual pad that this company ships to you...it is a rip off...the product code is P/N 20223, not a Decelerator as shown in the pic. I recommend that you shop for a reputable sales location...this is not a good source for products if they are intentionally misleading you prior to the purchase."
4,Pachmayr Slip On Recoil Pad,"It works! Can't give it much more of a performance review than that. Be sure your buying the right size for your butt stock. The only issue is the deapth of the rubbed surround/sleeve that holds the butt pad in place. Depending on the stock it may be a bit long (one inch or less has been my experience) and interfer with the rear sling mount. It can be trimed to alleviate this issue, or do what I did. Mark the spot that the sling mount would come through the rubber sleeve and puch a hole with an office hole punch. The alternative is to use the Limbsaver version, which has a shorter sleeve but generally costs more. They both work equally well, so the choice is yours. I would not recommend either of them for an AR15 (so called black gun) or clone with the A2 style solid stock, the sling mount point is too close to the butt of the stock, but if your careful you can do the hole punch routine. Just don't blame me if it subsequent tears from the weak point."
2,"Another example of the ""wrong emphasis""......","One only has to review the table of contents to understand the logic behind this book. It's another attempt to ""humanize"" what can only be comprehended supernaturally. What should stand out to a saavy bible student is the lack of scriptural references and the failure to tie key points to a sound, systematic theology. This is a product of poor hermaneutics and another indication that Zondervan has lost its ability to discern doctrinally sound material. An unregenerate religionist could read this and really think they were on track (there's no differentiation between saved and lost). But hey, if your motivation is to generate profit....then it all makes sense.To those that really want to understand spirtual growth from a biblical perspective, check out Miles Stanford. He nailed it."
5,The Typing of the Dead,"I purchased this game after playing the demo from cdi-wholesalers/Amazon and it arrived in 2 days ""brand spad new"". The game is funny, entertaining and you will type faster. When there are zombies and other monsters attacking and all you can do is type to stay alive...YOU WILL TYPE OR DIE BUDDY! I have used a few other typing programs and they were just fine but this ones for me. I hope they come up with an updated version like ""The Typing of the Dead 2"". I will be the first on in line for that one."
4,"It isn't Pink Floyd, but Its Deafinitely something.","I will repeat myself: this isn't a Pink Floyd album. Lacking here is the conceptual sweep (thanks to Waters) and seamless layers of sound common to Pink Floyd (thanks to Wright). However, what this album DOES have is Gilmour's stellar guitarwork, his way with melodies, and his great singing voice. Highlights include ""There's No Way Out of Here,"" ""Cry From the Street,"" and ""Mihalis,"" but the real A-song from this album is ""Short & Sweet,"" where the dimension of Gilmour's songwriting really comes through. Excellent stuff."
3,"Buy it because Dave needs a new boat, Overall disappointing","I have been a Floyd fan for 20 plus years and my friends and family as well. I bought this album long ago because it was Dave; the only reason. This album is not stunning, or magical; Dave's album is flat out a lackluster cd. The track, There's no way out of here, is probably the best. This album clearly shows who the main (not all) mastermind was behind Floyd-Roger Waters. Honestly, if your a true Floyd fan buy the album, if not hold to your ten bucks."
2,Forgettable Solo Effort,"Were David Gilmour not a member of Pink Floyd, there's no way this album would still be in print after 22 years. Gilmour's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer, but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate, Roger Waters. It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge. Gilmour's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd's sound, but on his own he has nothing much to say. The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable. They are also pleasent enough, but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe. That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament. But its no reason to indulge him these many years later."
5,Have courage to hear another voice other than yours,"To all the commentators who didn't like this book:Have courage to hear another voice other than yours.The institution of marriage, like it or not, is going towards extinction from the face of the earth. It is not functional and it is not useful any more. It has lost its position as the glue for keep the members of the society in their units.This is the direction of history and you can't do any thing about it."
4,Witty and Blunt,"A barbed expose of the myths surrounding the sacred cows of marriage and monogamy. I found myself shaking my head in agreement many times while reading this book. I also laughed until tears rolled down my eyes at the long list of things one mustn't do while in a long-term relationship.The only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars was Kipnis' excessive use of run-on sentences. Otherwise, good job!"
2,Not one of Clarke's best works...,"Despite what many of the other reviewers said, I don't think Gentry Lee was the reason this book wasn't very good. He worked with Clarke on most of the Rama series, too, and those were some of the best books I've ever read. It seems to me that this book was a fluke. It was full of factual errors, which surprised me, since I've never found errors in any of Clarke's other works. This novel was basically a soap opera."
1,Disappointing,"Gave up after 220 pages. Hidden plot, cardboard characters, disjointed storyline. Clarke must have had little to do with this yawner."
1,Absolutely atrocious,"This book was atrocious. I picked it up on a whim as I had never read Clarke but knew about his reputation. This was not a good first Clarke book to read. In fact, it's not a good book to read period.The plot was weak but the characters were by far the worst part of this whole endeavor. It made me wonder if the authors even knew how to write good characterization. It felt like they spent most of their time reminiscing about their pasts and quivering with emotion over it. No human beings speak or act like these people did.The sci-fi parts that didn't involve any of the characters were by far the best bits but they were few and far between. This felt more like a grocery store romance novel with science fiction elements shoehorned in."
3,Kept me interested,"I found it difficult to put this book down because I kept thinking that very soon I would read the information that would make the story crystal clear to me. That never happened but it was still an interesting story.What really kept pulling my attention away from the flow of the story were the references to Troy's color (black) and his touching and/or kissing Carol. What for? Also, Carol's constant assertiveness became boring and overdone. The aliens were the only characters who were 'normal.'"
2,What has happened to the colour?,"After waiting so long for this title to get a DVD or Video release, I was amazed to see that the original 3 strip technicolor has not been re-mastered for the DVD release. There seems to be a lack of yellow and all the cast have pink faces instead of flesh tones. As the film has recently played on cable television here in a near perfect color corrected version, I cannot understand why Fox have not taken more care in their DVD transfer. All the extras including trailers have this sub-standard look. Apart from this point, it is still a great film and a must for devotees of top Hollywood musicals if you haven't seen it."
5,scrapbook album,I assume that I would enjoy this album except that I ordered it by mistake thinking it was 3 ring.
5,Just another Jody Bleyle fan...,"This cd is awesome, and I don't even own it yet. Jody Bleyle rocks the house, and anyone who is a Team Dresch fan should totally own it."
2,la usurpadora,"i haven't received my dvd ""maria la del barrio"" but i did received ""la Usurpadora"". Unfortunately the condition of dvd wasn't good enough. there was scratch in dvd. I hope i can receive my dvd ""maria la del barrio"" soon. thanks"
4,Hitch cover,I bought this as a gift for my father. He really likes it and it looks good on his truck.
1,"Geez, I really messed up...but not as badly as TQ","If you are a die hard TQ fan and think you need this to complete your collection then think again. TQ is only on a couple of songs and he is drowned out by worthless rapper/singer people with no lyrics or beat. This album is awful, and I am a die hard TQ fan. He's barely on this thing. There is not one song on the whole album worth 2 stars. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP! TQ has 4 great albums out. Go get those first. Then get the songs he made with Sarah Connor. Then, if you REALLY can't live without having every recording to TQ's voice on disc get this album."
4,HEEP is good!,"This album was released in 1969, together with Zeppelin, purple, Sabbath. Uriah Heep started their debut.The songs here are classic masterpieces in their early 70's hey day, check out them in the first album like gypsy, dreammare, I'll keep on trying, Come away melinda etc......what a goldies collection it is! Heep is also good as Led Zeppelin, Purple, Black Sabbath in the 70's rock classic era.Long time ago the American journalist at the rolling stone magazine Melissa Mills wrote that I will rather to commit suicide than listening to this band.Yes Melissa Mills was a fool poor journalist,....she didn't know how good this band is!In fact that URIAH HEEP sold out their albums/recordings worldwide 30 million albums until today!! well you know this now,....Is Uriah Heep still a bad group ??? you should answer it by your selves! This band is a goldies..."
4,First heap of 'Heep,"This is one of the better Heep albums in that it still has residual psychedelic elements in songs like ""Dreammare"" and ""Gypsy"", combined with some mammoth riffs by guitarist Mick Box (check out ""I'll Keep On Trying"", ""Walking In Your Shadow"", and the two tracks mentioned above). However, there is mercifully little of the often piercing, shrieking vocals that David Byron was later known for. It contains much Hammond organ, progressive diversions, and liberal usage of wah wah....everthing that made early 70's heavy rock fun and grooving. If you dig Deep Purple and/or early Sabbath, go get it!"
4,Early Kat - still good,"As I understand it, this was Kat Martin's first novel.It is the story of a young woman, brought up by her strict military father in the ""old west"". She wants to experience life, other than at her father's fort. She switches places with her ""almost identical cousin"" who has fallen in love with a man that her father wouldn't approve of. Our heroine travels from Wyoming - to Utah - to Nevada - to California before her ruse is discovered.I honestly liked the characters - the hero was a white raised by the indians - and their interactions were at times very funny. The only thing I didn't like was the name dropping of historical figures.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Kat Martin - her writing then vs now is quite different, but this book showed she had (and has) a lot of promise."
4,THE BIRDS ARE LIVE AND KICKING,"The Yardbirds are back and as good as ever, live in this Reunion Jam. Though the guitarist had some huge shoes to fill, he does an excellent job. The music is clear, crisp, and enjoyable with all of the old bird favorites. After listening to this cd, it is easy to see why they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I recommend this cd to any rock fan who loves good rock classics."
2,Difficult to use,"I purchased this gutter cleaning kit because I thought it would be easier to use than climbing onto the roof again. Once everything was assembled and connected to my Weed Eater blower I found it difficult to use. First, when I moved the blower's power lever past the half way point the gutter kit blew apart at the base. IT works at slower speeds but it's difficult for one person to handle alone because it isn't connected to the blower securely enough. I gave up and climbed back onto the roof."
3,Perhaps it's better on an electric,"Connection at blower pops right off. The connection tabs match up, but connection is not secure enough for the air pressure from a 25cc gas blower. It seems like the air hits the elbow and the pressure pushes it off. Perhaps it works better on a smaller blower? I wish they had told me. I guess I'll have to try a flex coupler or sheet metal screws to keep it on. Currently, as designed and advertised, this product is a failure."
1,Not so much,"Sent this item back.Great customer service from Amazon. Accepted a complete refund.This item was way too complicated to attach. What should be a very easy thing, attaching several tubes together, was way too hard.In addition, it kept popping off from the blower when attempting to utilize.Waste of time. Sent it back from whence it came."
4,GUTTER CLEANING MADE SAFE AND EASY,"The gutter attachment works well and is easy to assemble and use. It is very lightweight and working from the ground is much easier, faster and safer than using a ladder. I bought a second set and will join them together to try and clean my second story gutters - have not had time to try this yet but it appears that it should work just as well."
4,gutter cleaner,works good only on low speed of weed eater blower. could not hold when high speed used.
4,It's good but..,"El taladro es realmente bueno, tiene buen r.p.m, y no recalienta en trabajo pesado. El unico problema es que cuando le das trabajo forzozo la mecha tiende a aflojarse y tienes que apretar nuevamente con la llave.."
4,A somewhat pretentious classic,"This record is a classic. This is pure pop music at its best. I partially agree with another reviewer who thought that it was a pretentious album because of all the orchestral arragements. I think that only 2 songs could be so labeled. But for an album to have songs like ELDORADO and Mr. Kingdom and many others, it is just impossible to give it a bad review. If you buy this album, I assure you you will not regret it. Some of the sounds are somewhat dated but, you will understand that the melodies and lirics are the work of masters and if you think about it, this is what matters the most. I would think that if a new, stripped down version of this album is made, it would definately become a bigger classic than it is now. This is the only reason why I dont give it a full 5 star rating. Then again, 4 stars is pretty good...dont you think?"
2,My first ELO Nay!,"This is my least favorite ELO album. Seems so rushed and undeveloped. The orchestral parts have no backbone and lyricaly it is just as weak. Time was such an excellent album because of how much went into it. Eldorado is cheesy and alot of the riffs and solo's seem practically pulled right from older albums. Unless your one of those fans who cant say a thing negative about ELO and must give them 5 stars on every album, you wont be to happy with this one. The bonus instrumental is the only thing that stands out here."
5,ELO with a 30 piece orchestra!,"ELO with an orchestra! One of the better ""concept"" albums out there. My favorite ELO album without a doubt."
3,Oops.,"Fine arrangements of a most attractive program. As great Peters' fans, we now have to face the fact that the voice is losing its sparkle. After a slightly embarassing opening song, the program gains momentum. However, we have to now realize that Bernadette Peters' fine talents are probably best appreciated visually."
3,WHERE IS THE REST????,"This should have been a (2)disc album there is so much more material that could have been used SO much that i dare not start listing for fear of running out of room, But it would have been better with some more up-beat songs i would advise Ms. Peters to go back into the studio and make a new album""MORELOVEof R&H"
2,Love doesn't conquer all,"Ms Peter's love of the music doesn't shine through here, instead it appears to be great music performed by a great singer taken out of context. There is no life in this art, I wanted to shout, Wake Up!! Instead I just ejected the cd and replaced Julia Fordham into the cd player...."
2,Just Too Much Off,"I love BP and were I not married, I could see me making quite a fool of myself over her. Thought I'd REALLY like this CD; however, was so disappointed. It is all subjective, but for me her voice is just that little bit off when I hear these pieces. It just did not meet what I expected. Again, listening to music and song is quite subjective. Use the 30 sec. sound bites that Amazon offers us, and make your own decisions."
2,I wasn't knocked out,"Well, as a Bernadette fan, I was very excited to get this recording, but I've listened to it once and frankly, I doubt I'll listen to it again. Her vocals just don't sail in this one. I appreciated her fun interpretation of ""There is Nothing Like A Dame"", but some of the big ballads like ""If I Loved You"" and ""Something Wonderful"" didn't measure up to the work this splendid singer/actress has done on other recordings. I wonder about her wobbly, gravely low notes. IStick to Bernadette Peters Sings Mostly Sondheim-now there's a CD I have worn out!"
2,Maybe just for die-hard BP fans?,"I could hardly wait to get the CD but was disappointed in the quality of her voice in places. The orchestrations are great, but there were times when she just didn't quite hit the notes. And ""Nothing Like a Dame"" was just one big mistake in my book. If you're a total BP fan you'll probably enjoy it; if you're not, save your money."
2,Very Disappointed in this CD,"Did not think Ms. Peters voice was up to par--she sounded tired and weak. The musical arrangements were mediocre, not exciting, boring. Kept waiting for a song to get better but they never did. The flow of voice and instruments was jerky and hard to listen to. And Ms. Peters is normally one of my favorites!"
1,"Frustratingly tough chew. Technically, probably a masterpiece","Hi,I'm sorry, but I only finished the first chapter.Why? The text was frustratingly difficult to penetrate. It's one of the toughest texts that I have ever come across. Being very interested in the subject matter, I dove in to try to understand the underlying reasons affecting the economic development of the economic regions, present and historically.The curiosity of trying to find elightenment drove me to keep pushing through the text, but eventually I gave up.Even at the risk of distorting the content, the author should team up with someone adept at conveying the content and rewrite the book. The content seems invaluable, but is locked up and unaccessible because of the way it was written.Regards, Fredrik Folkesson"
4,"This was a fun book, wonderful for those who rationalize.",This book was a fun summer read that really extended possiblilities for what one can do during a summer vacation. The book also does wonders for Jamaica
1,This book was terrible.,"Terry girl what's up with this book? I really enjoyed all of your other books, especially Waiting to Exhale, but this book was horrible. What is the deal with the intertwinning thoughts? All of Stella's inner thoughts did not need to be written down. The book was confusing and it had no "" UMPH"" to it. And they are actually going to make a movie from this book. I hope that it's going to be an HBO special or a LIFETIME movie, because if it actually goes to the movie theater people are going to ask for their money back. The only good thing about this book is that Stella was a strong and somewhat independently well-to-do black women with a portfolio. The girl seemed to have bank and she could buy anything she wanted.Terry, I don't mean to diss you because your other books were great, but you could have kept this one."
1,I got in a rut just trying to finish this oh-so tedious book,"Oh the self absorbed shallow preoccupation with one's self!This book was so boring--the first book my book club voted not necessary to finish.Shelia may have got back into her groove but it certainly wasn't through any kind of insightful or thoughtful reflection or soul searching. This book reads rather like a constant commerial for material goods---'no fear' shirts--'seal c.d's' and on and on and on. Perhaps if Shelia had stopping focusing on designer or brand name items she would have got her groove back much sooner. The characters lacked depth, the conversations were bland, and the story --well where was the story? Shelia needed to get a personality---not necessarily a young lover."
1,Stella is poorly written and even more poorly spoken.,"In the audio version of How Stella Got Her Groove Back, the author took the time to perform the reading of the book herself. She shouldn't have bothered. She could have spent her time more constructively by putting more effort into the writing of the book. I couldn't listen to 15 minutes before turning off the tape. Ms. McMillan seems to stumble through words she, herself had written making it hard to focus on the story she is trying to tell. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and tried to read the written version. Unfortunately, the story was disappointing and the author appears to have rushed through the writing. Terry, next time spend the time on the writing and let the professionals do the reading."
1,How Stella Got Her Groove Back,I admit that I have only read the first two chapters. That was painful. I am not one to read rambling on of one's feelings on and on and on. I can see how the movie version might be better?
3,Other Books,"A woman isn't too happy at the current point in time. She goes on holiday to one of those gated resorts in Jamaica to try and have a good time and maybe do a bit of young man cradle snatching into the process.She gets a bit more than she bargained for and decides to try and import her bloke, dealing with the complications."
3,Almost a 3 and a half rating.,"This book was fun and overall I enjoyed it but it took me awhile to finish it because the story didn't retain my interest enough to want to keep turning the page. The story and characters as well as the writing style was different and fun, but overall I wouldn't put this on my high recommended reading list. Some of my friends adored this book, as for me, nope. It was ok-pretty good, definitely not great."
2,"Superhuman characters, stagnant plot, intrusive style.","Stella, a divorced mother, is perfect. Not only is she financially successful, superbly educated (3 degrees) and artistically savvy, she possesses a self-awareness which seems downright impossible. Rivalled only by her smart, obedient and emotionally precocious 11-year-old son, Stella does not need a new groove: she needs a human side. Stella's trip to Jamaica and fling with a 21 year old is an interesting daydream, but the book should have ended with her return to the U.S. and not drawn out the saccharine phone calls and tormented emotions of her growing love for him. All 450 pages of Stella's mental thrashings are punctuated by a lack of puncation, namely commas and periods, and a chatty style that's all style and very little substance. A quick, effortless read, but not for the easily bored."
2,A Reader from DC,"Terry McMillan is an excellent writer, but she must have been tired when she wrote this. Disappearing Acts, Mama and Waiting to Exhale all had me in frizzy of mixed emotions filled with laughter, joy and pain. I was definitely relating to the characters when I read these books. But Stella and her groove back, pleeze. It started out good, but was too long and drawn out. It was sort of like reading a boring diary after the excitement of an affair wore off. It was so bad, I put it down after I was half way through and I never touched it again. I got the book as a birthday present and almost regretted asking for it. Terry girl, you have done better. I think you ought to stick to the men bashing. It's more you!"
1,I can't remember ever having read a worse book. PULEEZE!,"What a waste of my time. Thank heaven I borrowed the book and didn't purchase it. There is NOTHING I could recommend about it. The protagonist was shallow. Her indecision (should I, shouldn't I; I'm too old, he's too young)), her self-evaluation - GET OVER IT! I found her very unlikeable. In the end, who cares?"
1,A sad effort - not worth picking up!!,"If you enjoy trying to decipher run-on sentences, then this book is for you. If you love the word ""Tripp'n"" , this book is for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for well developed characters, keep looking. If your looking for a realistic, fun story line, run to any other book. This book was sorry from cover to cover. Terry, you know you could have done better."
2,Debating whether to finish or not,"It's not even the run-on sentences that I mind, but the constant back and forth with being happy and sad, happy and mad, etc. By reading these reviews I have found out how the book ends. This is good. Now I don't have to finish it unless I dare go through one more long sentence about how she thinks she's too old and he's too young (BLAH-blah-blah). Just get on with the story already. I can't stand the tediousness of it all. The best character in this whole book is sweet little Quincy (the only character who seems to have his head on straight). WTE was much better to read."
1,It was the Bomb,"This book was terrible. I kept looking for a plot, a climax, and found neither. The story went on and on and ended with a lot to be desired. I simply didn't see the point."
3,"Not bad, not great","There are some fascinating moments in this recording, for example Horowitz playing his wonderful Carmen variations (marvellous to see although there is a bizarre bit of editing where you momentarily see some footage of Horowitz playing something that doesn't match with the sound!) There is also some stupendous footage of Cziffra playing the Grand Gallope Chromatique. I found the whole thing rather charming, but not at all profound. It is really a collection of thumbnail sketches of the various pianists included (and I agree with the other reviewer who commented that some notable great pianists seem to have been left out). Not bad."
4,Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden,"Yes, this video is quite appealing in its incredible clips of many of the great pianists of the past but I would like to ask a question-where are the women?! There are only two women represented-Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, who plays the Minute Waltz practically during the final credits. What about Clara Haskill or Guimar Novaes or any other of a host of wonderful women pianists? Of course if there are no clips of them that is telling in itself. Plus, all the commentators are male. What about asking someone like Martha Agerich for her comments! Anyone who doubts that there is a white male aesthetic should watch this video. And incidentally, the fact that none of the other reviewers even sees anything amiss with this picture just proves the point."
3,Little rough around the edges,"This is a debut book and it shows. Not that the story is bad- I actually found it very refreshing and promising. The hero is a virgin (imagine that!) and the heroine is likable (although nothing special).The plot was already discussed by other reviewers, so no need for me to repeat it. But I'm surprised that no one mentioned how 'modern' the whole book sounded. It almost felt as if MacKenzie wrote a contemporary novel and set it in the 19th century. The dialogs were so full of anachronisms that it was just hard to read. There was even a use of ""ok"" somewhere. This was a huge turn off for me and the book would deserve about 4 stars if this wouldn't be a problem.I think that Sally MacKenzie is an author to watch for. I would not buy her books (yet), but I would definitely get them from the library."
3,Disappointing.,"I pre ordered this book with great expectations based on the promo info. It's an easy read but it's also just your average regency. The plot is fairly standard.The innocence/naivite of our heroine gets old pretty fast. Hard to believe that a doctor's daughter,teacher at a girls school doesn't know how babies are made!!!That was tiresome. The duke however is adorable and likeable."
2,Overall Rating: 1.80,"Overall Rating: 1.80 // Action: 2.5 / Emotion: 1 / Romance: 3 / Sensuous: 1 / Intrigue: 3.5 // Regency Flavor: 2.5 / Laughter: 2 / Tears: 0Abject apologies to Sally MacKenzie for not liking her debut book, ""The Naked Duke,"" the first book in ""The Naked Nobility Series.""Although thought the opening gambit original, cute, fun, and intriguing, never did warm up to the absolutely perfect hero, James William Randolph Runyon, Duke of Alvord, nor the heroine, Sarah Marie Hamilton. Surely reading about a destitute woman, on her own, in a foreign country, with no signs of finding employment, living with strangers would dredge up some concern. Specific reasons for discontent with this book can be found in more detailed review at Wolf Bear Does Books.Even though ""The Naked Duke,"" was not a total wash (did finish the book), would not recommend it. Yes, pick up and read this book if you have no other book handy, but otherwise, look elsewhere for a great read."
4,Wonderful Surprise!,"I was wonderfully surprised by this author and this delightful, light and lively story. Quick read. Fun characters. Sure it's not true to the period in that all of the main characters are solid members of the ton while showing true distain for it and propriety goes out of the window frequently. An easy read."
1,A Dumb Blonde Book,"Combine a dumb blonde---even if she had red hair, a duke with no duke-ness, a male relative who doesn't care and a phony, one note bad guy...and you have ""A Naked Duke"". American writers who can't get it right shouldn't try the regency thing or be published. For example, the naked duke, now dressed, is told by a female relative to roll the carpets up so they may dance. A Duke roll carpets in his own home?????? The annoying red head [and why are there so many 'I must be ugly 'cuz I have red hair'] love interest doesn't know that if she is found in bed, much less with a man by herself, she either marries or is an outcast. The only male relative she has doesn't care if she is ruined. I could go on, but I think you get the drift. Please vote for better books by not buying. Books like this one is the reason that historical romances have no respect."
3,Solid entry in this ongoing series,"I disagree with some of the previous reviews. The overall quality of the stories is okay. I think the real problem is that there are no really outstanding stories in this volume. The stories I liked best were by Charles Saplak, Lisa Deason and Deborah J. Ross. Unfortunately, most of the other stories are simply not memorable enough. I hope that the next volume will be as good as some of the early volumes. By the way, Diana L. Paxson will step in as editor."
4,Cobra XRS-9430 12-Band Radar Detector,I found the product to be worth the price and operationally effect.
2,Cobra,"I am not very happy with this product. It doesn't exactly let you know when a police officer is around and when it does it would be too late if you were speeding due to the fact it waits until you are right next to the police officer. The detecter beeps more for Kroger, Bp, and red lights. So, right now I'm not very happy."
1,no more cobras,I HAVE HAD THIS UNIT FOR A YEAR. VOICE WAS NEVER CLEAR BUT ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO IT GOT REAL BAD AND YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS SAYING AT ALL. NOW THE VOICE WENT OUT ALL TOGETHER. I HAVE HAD AND USED RADAR DETECTORS SINCE THE OLD FOXES IN 1977. I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE BREAK UNTIL THIS COBRA. I ONLY GET RID OF THEM TO UPDATE. THIS ONE IS JUNK. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
3,Talk about over price,"I'm sure it doesn't cost much to manufacture this cleaning tape. It's way over price. But I'm using it with a $3500 Canon camcorder so I am willing to pay for the Canon recommended head cleaning tape. Okay, I will stop whinning now."
2,Worked once - then never again,"This worked when I first bought this. My camera heads got dirty again so I put this in and tried it. Nothing. I did it four times, as the guide recommends - but it still didn't work.Canon wants $179 for me to mail the camera in for a professional cleaning. NO thanks."
5,Best toy my son has ever gotten!!!,This toy is sooo much fun for my little boy!! He is 18 months old and just loves driving this Plasmacar all over the house and outside as well.He is able to steer it super easy and glide all over the place. My 12 yr old daughter has fun on it also!! I would recommend this item for all young children!! It is SO FUN!!!
1,Wow.,"Wow this version was awful! It says that it is in English, but it is Shakespearean English. It is nearly impossible to understand; definitely buy the Robert Fitzgerald translation if you plan on reading this book. I am not a stupid person, but this book was impossible! Please choose a different version."
4,Proud parent of a reader,"The Odysseywas for my son who is an avid reader. He already has this book in hard cover, but it is so much more convenient to have it on his Kindle because of it being such a large book to carry around. He has read The Odyssey several times and is very happy with this selection."
3,There are 2 Wildside editions,"For a scholarly edition with all the notes by Theodore Alois Buckley, see Wildside's other edition, ISBN 978-1-4344-6138-4 (The Odyssey of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope.) This edition is meant for casual reading."
2,Not Homer's Odyssey,I downloaded this thinking it was Homer's Odyssey. It is not. The title is misleading.
4,Free Classics!,I was so excited to get this classic for free on Amazon! I will definitely be reading this one on my kindle soon!
2,Not really what I expected,"I have owned and used the Studio 8 for many years and decided to upgrade it due to new features like HD and iPod conversions! The entire product looks almost exactly the same as my old version 8 with a new ""face lift"". The very expected iPod conversion was not even close in quality to the TMPGenc. It takes way too long to convert and the final result is poor. Together with the product came as a free bonus two volumes of their FX effects but when I tried to unlock it it says I have a wrong key code! I got absolutely no answer from my e-mails to Pinnacle requesting a solution for that unlocking key."
2,Not too impressed with Pinnacle 11,"This was an upgrade from version 9 to 11. Now that I have version 11 I wished I had spent my money else where. I was really expecting the ability to edit sounds to be improved, this was whole reason for me to upgrade from version 9. The new version is just as bad at allowing sound manipulation as the older version. Sound is 50% of your video. I like everything else about this software, but the sound editing ability, or lack of, severely disappoints me...."
3,Better WAIT,"Like all new programs, the beta bugs are not all exterminated!!The work space has a different look simply by changing the colour bar on the timeline.The Pro DAD effects are quite good but it is easy to overwhelm the program and it can freezzze quite easily which is very frustrating, I have seen on the Pinnacle forum site some issues with burning , I have had 1 disk that failed but I could not see why.I think the transitions and effects in prodad and ease of use make this a program that is worth having, but I will look forward to the ""fix Patches"" which must surely come."
1,Still trying to get it working weeks later,"I installed the product out of the box and before you knew it, I was happily importing video and editing the content with no problem. Unfortunately, when it was time to create the DVD the problems began.... Everytime I tried to render the project or burn the disk the software just hangs. I can render any format except DVD (which is why I bought the software). After multiple uninstalls and reinstalls Pinnacle's advise is to reinstall my operating system and try again. I would be very leery of purchasing this for your windows computer if it isn't a fairly clean operating install (unless you think you want to reinstall the OS)."
1,Shame on Pinnacle and Avid,"I have been using Pinnacle's Studio Products since Version 5 I think. It's kind of like have a very bright kid with lots of potential but they are not living up to it. I still keep hoping with each upgrade that they will get right. Well, Version 11 doesn't do it for me. Rending is a major problem. It doesn't matter what kind of cool effects you can do it if you can't rending properly. Support just told me another ""work around"". Copy and paste my project into a new file... that didn't work either. Shame on Pinnacle and Avid!"
1,Doesn't Work,"I tried this product 3 times without success. All three times I was able to get the tab to stick very well to the glass, but there was never conductivity from the tab to the defroster glass. The glue acted as an insulator and did not allow electric current to get where it needed to get. A junk product."
3,"Works, but instructions could be much better.","This stuff actually worked for me, but the instructions could be much better. The liquid is conductive. The glue isn't. Use the glue to stick the detached clip back on the window. After the glue dries, paint the joint with conductive liquid. Apply multiple coats, allowing each to dry, same as any other paint job. That's what I did over a warm weekend last summer (2009) and the repair has held all winter."
4,Great Story of a Forgotten General,"An excellent book covering the Army career of Orlando B.Wilcox, from graduation at West Point, through the final stages of the Mexican War, the Third Seminole War, the Civil War and then back on the plains with the American Indians. This officer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1895 for ""most distinguished gallantry"" during the battle of Bull Run. The author has done a great job in bringing alive this forgotten American general with the use of his journals, memoirs and letters. A great read and highly recommended for those who enjoy first-hand accounts of the Civil War"
3,"It is very simple, and delightful","When one views a film like this, one realizes that Hollywood produces pure crap, pardon the expression. So much money is spent on actors and special effects, etc., that little if any attention is given to the simple art of movie-making.This movie, filmed in a remote, isolated village in post-Soviet Armenia, is about families and death and love, and the beauty and simplicity of life. For those who are purists and love films, this one should be added to your library. It is very simple, and delightful."
4,Comprehensive,"Quite a few errors were found.However, the book appears to give a thorough review of NY State Regents material for Chemistry: The Physical Setting."
5,Excellent book!,"Excellent book, filled with examples. As complete as you're going to find it. Good, clear text. Recommended."
2,Not What I Remembered,"Love the voice, but the tempo of the songs was too quick for the type of songs on this album. As such, it didn't have the rich-ness or I remembered or expected."
2,Live at the Hungry I,I have many of the songs on this CD in a LP and have been waiting to get a CD replacement since the LP is very old and noisy. I am very disappointed with the sound quality of this CD - my old LP sounds better if I can ignore the clicks and pops.
5,Scosche EWFH Single ANL Fuse Holder,I like these better then the other inline fuse because they are well covered and easy to replace and tell if they are blown.
5,Holder of Fuses,"Held my ANL fuse like a champ, and easily handled 1/0 gauge wire. The ""e"" logo kinda gets in the way of the fuse ""window"" but that's not bad enough to dock a star. For $7 shipped this was perfect."
3,needs a tougher case,The base of this holder cracked right away and had to be replaced with a tougher unit. I recommend upgrading to a better quality fuse holder.
5,It is an insulated and well protected fuse holder,"Nothing more to say about the product. It is a heavy duty, quality product. The vendor, however, did a great job keeping me informed of my order and shipping status."
4,A DECENT FUSE HOLDER,"In my opinion this is a good or decent fuse holder everting seems to fit as should be, has a nice plastic case, easy to take it off and nice clear cover to see if the fuse is bad or not I put a 2/0 awg gage wire oin it and just fit tite, but perfect..!!"
4,"Good CD, look elsewhere if you want the techno","Wake up, people- this is a film score. that means that you get some kick a** music but none of the techno. A lot of people have asked about techno songs from the movie, and I will help if I can- the bloodbath song is, of course, Confusion by New Order, and as another reviewer said the music Frost is listening to in the archives is Call and Response by Source Direct. I have heard that the bar scene (with the japanese school girls) is Ah, Singapore by Shonen Knife but I have not found the right mix yet- anyone know where to look? The first song from the end credits is Southside Reverb's ""Go Get On it"". If anyone has info on the bar song or any other songs email me at event_horizon@techie.com Even if you just want the techno, buy this CD anyway, it has some good stuff."
2,Soundtrack from House of Pain scene,"Again, sorry this isn't a review of the CD, which by the way I gave it a 2-star rating since I don't really like most of the songs on the CD (except for the original Blade II score, which for techno lovers is OK), but for those looking for the music track to the ""House of Pain"" scene the track can be found on the ""Planet Trance 03"" CD, track 9. This track is NOT on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack."
1,Hello..was this even in the movie???,"**Was it me or did this soundtrack really suck?? I want some of the music from the club seen at the beggining,the japanese club music was stellar, or maybe the three songs played at the end when the credits came on??? Why was that not on the soundtrack?? The movie was great..I bought it so I'll listen to the movie before that garbage soundtrack..if anyone knows were to get any of the ""better"" songs from the movie..e mail me.."
4,Overscore but no underscore,"This has all of the overscore which WAS in the movie. For all of the underscore, I would appreciate help myself."
3,good for certain things,"If you have a little pudge around our belly then these will sqeeze around your waist and cause an indention in your waist that is noticeable when wearing many types of clothing. My wife can wear these with some skirts and a couple of pairs of pants, but not with most of her shorts and most of her other pants.I could only recommend these for a woman who has very little body fat. Maybe if it were a low rise, and not ""super low rise"", it wouldn't have that problem."
4,Good Stuff,"I'm a return customer for this stuff. I use it on my motorcycle because it's fast and effective. It's a bit expensive so I'll only give it 4 stars, but a bottle lasts me the full riding season."
4,Blood & Donuts is a hoot,"I loved it. The story is interesting. The characters and setting are interesting. Gordon Currie as Boya the vampire is great, funny one minute, creepy and homicidal the next. Very good and interesting movie."
1,What decade is this scent from,"Such a very strong smell. Gave me an immediate headache. Big mistake to order this..threw it out. The color you see in the ad is not the true color. As soon as you see a very dark color, you know it's strong and this was!!"
3,READ IF U HAVE A 1997 TUARUS,"if u have the jbl audio sounf system do not get this for your radio. MAKE SURE you do not have the jbl audio system. Go in your trunk, and look behind the material that covers ur trunk. You will see a factory amp. If it says jbl on it. Dont get a radio. Because if u get this kit u will lose your climate controls if u install a head unit."
3,Very weird...but cool story,"This is a quick read that will totally mess with your mind. I like novels like this--reminds me of Crash by JG Ballard-quick, dirty and jarringingly bizarre."
2,If you can't use a knife...,"Maybe if you have no knife skills whatsoever, this could be a useful tool. I do a lot of cooking from scratch and use LOTS of vegetables. I thought this would save me a lot of time. It is awkward to use and I feel like I'm abusing the produce with it. I like to make homemade french fries and if it could have done just that one job well it would have been worth keeping. It even failed that. The largest julliene setting made very very thin fries. I'm returning it today because it wastes a lot of food, it is cumbersome to store, and it just feels like a wrestling match everytime I use it.P.S. It can't do carrots, celery, or cucumbers because they are too skinny, so don't think this will help you in your quest to cook more asian style foods (that is exactly what I had been hoping for)"
1,"Helen of Troy Curling Iron Mega 1 1/4"" 1516","The item did not get hot enough to curl hair. Tried on different hair types. The item was purchased for $16.97 in total, but when returned received only $7.02 credit. Item sent at my expense 2nd day UPS and tracked. Not sure why the refund was so significantly reduced."
1,Yikes! How the mighty have fallen...,"Wow! This album is...huh...ok, look. Ringo Starr released some fantastic music during his solo career and the work he is currently doing is above reproach, but this album...is ununspired, insipid, trivial, lackluster, directionless and lifeless. I'm a Beatles FANATIC and as such do not regret spending my money on this disc. But, as a word of warning, as big a fan as I am, this album will very possibly live out the rest of its days firmly shelved, unless my cat knocks it onto the floor. I guarantee, however, that it will never again see the inside of a CD player. I hate to write a review this harsh because I LOVE RINGO, but yikes...how the mighty have fallen..."
1,LIARS,I thought these speakers looked nice and I wanted a small set of speakers that I could plug in at work. WRONG CHOICE!!!!! I processed the return 5 minutes after opening them. They would be great if you were at a picnic in the woods with no outlet around but for my purposes they are not. There is NO WALL PLUG and NO AC ADAPTER PORT. If you want a set of speakers to plug in do not buy!
2,Mountain Meadow??? vs Paria,"Not the best book on the Paria, from one who has spent a great deal of time there. Dense and difficult, would be a challenge for a novice who didn't know the area to start with.I never did figure the association with Mountain Meadow???... Mountain Meadow is over 300 miles from the Paria! and the only connection with John D. Lee was that he ran a ferry at the Colorado River at one time. Save your money."
2,You mostly already know this book's content.,"If you've paid enough attention to your Windows application experiences, most of the standards revealed in this book will be familiar.Certainly there are useful tidbits to know, but most programmers today have no need for further illumination on the difference between a checkbox and an option button. Those useful tidbits are buried in lots of ""doesn't everyone know this?"" material. If you're been programming for Windows for awhile, you'll have to force yourself to read carefully. You probably should, but it's still hard."
3,A Nice Regency Romance,I have like several of Ms. Mullins stories in the past so I was surprised that this was not going to be a favorite. This was also a nice story but I feel that the ending of the story was a bit rushed and therefore left me feeling like there was something missing. The characters were fun and the story line had plenty of potential I just don't think the author gave it much of a chance. Still in all this was a nice story with a happy ending and it read fast.
3,"A selfish, arrogant hero","Throughout most of this book, Garret is trying to coax Lucinda to his bed. He doesn't care that she doesn't want a lover but a husband. He doesn't care that respectability is the only thing she has left. All he wants is to have a convenient mistress. He is too selfish and self-centered to be a good hero.Still, this is an entertaining book, but one that is quickly forgotten."
3,Transitional,"Travelling with new companion Bernice Summerfield, the Doctor's TARDIS arrives in a Solar Transit System, an interplanetary travel system in operation in the solar system. But an error rips a hole in the space-time continuum, and there is something on the other side...Written by the scripter of the popular 'Remembrance of the Daleks', this book wears its cyberpunk roots plainly on its sleeve. Unfortunately, it may take these influences too far - the jump cuts, the deliberate obfuscation, the subplots that go nowhere... This makes it a somewhat difficult read.Having said that, the novel introduces Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, a popular continuing character in the series. While Kadiatu's presence is welcome, the portrayal of Benny is problematic: this is her second story, and she spends most of it possessed by an alien intelligence.Between the non-portrayal of Benny and the very dense text, this book is something of a challenge, and probably best left to Doctor Who enthusiasts."
2,not good,"I'm a published fiction writer, and fiction writers find it tiresome how people of other fields of art think they can jump into fiction writing and pull it off without any apprenticing. People often sing and act well without ever having done it before, why not writing? Well, writing is a 3-dimensional art form, whereas the others are 2-dimensional. And Paul made the typical mistake of thinking he could just pick up a pen and let that screenplay flow without any trouble. The screenplay is GARBAGE. Paul himself later ACKNOWLEDGED this. He said, ""I really got caught up with writing the screenplay, so that I started giving other people ADVICE about writing screenplays. I really lost it there, and realize now I didn't know what I was doing."" At least he fessed up to it. I will say, what keeps me from giving this one star is that ""No More Lonely Nights"" is one of his best compositions since the Beatles, and to see Ringo and Paul together in the film was a treat."
3,"Give My Regards to Broadstreet"" McCartney","Liked the movie, the DVD is just like the movie.You also have a choice of Wide screen or Full.Good."
1,Ouch!,"Haven't seen the DVD but the vhs is one of those moments were it is truly embarrassing to be a Beatle fan. Integrity, coolness, innovation ... all gone. Paul starts selling out big time. This mockery of a movie marks the time when Paul is done as a creative artist. Even semi good albums like ""Flaming Pie"" and the badly titled and horrible art work of ""Driving Rain"" (which might have been a good album if the cover and title didn't suck so bad) went un-noticed because of this album and a few others like the pitiful 'Pipies of Peace"". People who liked him gave up at this point. I still love him but this movie seemed to be the beginning of the end when I first heard it and hasn't redeemed itself much since 1984. It's really hard to know what goes through an artist's mind when money, fame and fortune has been aquired. Maybe this movie is a good example. I hear that Paul is recording a new album in 2004. Hard to imagine were he's coming from. I do hope it's from a different place than this."
3,Give My Regards to Sir Paul,"Paul McCartney is in a quest to recover some missing master tapes, and finds time along the way to jam with lovable bloke Ringo Starr. Always fascinated with filmmaking, Paul's ""skill"" here hasn't really improved since he had a go with ""Magical Mystery Tour"". Like that earlier film, things come off as disjointed and confusing, but the music sequences deliver the goods. That they do: Paul reprises some Beatles hits as well as songs from ""Tug Of War"", ""Pipes Of Peace"", and ""Wings At The Speed Of Sound."" The music definitely carries the movie, Paul and Ringo are a delight to watch, but the storyline is pretty weak. Fans have head start, but others will probably be bored."
3,Best for the drummers,"I bought this item for my brother for Christmas. Although he has not used any of them yet, the look on his face when he unwrapped it was priceless. So, like i said they are the best for the drummers."
4,Good Oil Thingy,"It's a very nice looking oil thing.It's a lot smaller than it looks in the picture.And as I can attest, the glass is pretty thin. The first one I ordered didn't last even 5 min. out of the box. It was dropped at about 6in. and shattered into a million very sharp pieces.But it is very nice looking, works as it should and the wife approves.The dripper thing is kind of slow, but not because of the size of the hole. But it looks like it's having trouble getting air in to equal the pressure.But whatever!"
3,Glass is delicate and stopper is wiggly,"I'm just not enamored witt this item. It's fine, but the glass is so thin I'm afraid I'm going to break it every time I pick it up. The stopper on mine is also wiggly and not a tight fit. IT looks nice, it just isn't as great as I was hoping for. IT definitely feels small compared to my previous cruet."
5,Dress Up Your Table,"These bottles will certainly dress up your dinner table. They are leak proof and very attractive.You don't have to worry about impurities entering your food and body as these bottles are made of glass. The seal is tight to ensure no spillage and to keep your liquids fresh. The tiny opening in the stopper allows some air to enter, but the contents remain sealed within."
1,"The nut falls far, far from the tree","The one star is for the illustrations; they're pleasant enough, maybe just this side of average.Unfortunately, they accompany a story that could only have been published pulling the strings of one's famous grandfather. The tone verges on babytalk, and the story talks of immature love as well - boy meets girl, boy cheats on girl, girl takes boy back because . . . because?One reviewer gushes over the novelty of a lead character named ""Pierre"". I require a leetle more from my reading than quaintly-named characters. And as to the one-star rating belying my empty, pathetic, romanceless state - I promise to go over to Laurie Colwin's books and grant them all the 4- and 5-stars they deserve.Finally, for whimsical prose accompanied by clever line drawings that succeed together to create a romantic whole, see Brian Andreas' ""Mostly True"" or any of his other books."
4,Entertaining!,"I think this is a great song...lyrics and music. I actually saw this group in concert on 4/06/02 in Atlantic City...they were the opening act for Toby Keith and they put on a great show--very active on stage, powerful pop/country sound, and very clean-cut look!! I would highly recommend to catch this band in your local town, and I can't wait until there new CD is released (hopefully very soon)."
2,Disappointed,"The plastic cover ripped while attaching the case to my AudioVox 8915. Also, the case covers up the power connection port, making it hard to charge the cell phone with the case on. I will be looking for a another product."
5,Marilyn Monroe is your next door neighbor!,"Story about a young married couple who become landlords to an apartment building full of interesting tennants - including Marilyn Monroe (as Roberta). Marilyn is beautiful, funny, and charming as the ""sex symbol"" of the house. This is a cute romantic comedy - a sweet, simple movie about love, money, and trust. Would you trust your husband living next door to sexy Marilyn Monroe??"
3,not enough of monroe,"as a younger viewer (not born until the 1970's) I am just discovering Monroes films. I like ""7 year itch"", ""Niagra"" and ""dont bother to knock"", but this film doesn't have enough Monroe. If they didnt put her on the cover and pretend it was a Monroe film Im sure alot less people would have purhchased it. She isnt even well casted for the role. She doesn't look like she would have been a WAC.The film is okay, but its nothing worth owning. The plot is really stupid and the jokes aren't that great. All the actors did a great job, but there is only so much you can do with a silly premise like this..."
5,A delightful collection,This is a delightful collection of sayings and small writings of one of the great Torah teachers of our generation Rabbi Berel Wein. Rabbi Wein is a rare mixture of great Torah scholar and man - of- the world. His commonsensical no-nonsensical Torah based teaching is always instructive and often amusing.A highly recommended work.
1,some problems in the book,"I have not read the text, but it is my understanding that it parallels events in Joseph Smith's life with events that take place in the Book of Mormon. One such event, referred to in the title, is the death of Laban by his own sword at the hands of Nephi. It is also my understanding that, according to the author, Laban and Nephi are supposedly brothers and sons of Lehi. This leads the author to look at Joseph's family dynamic and make comparisons. I am assuming that this is a key instance in the text since it is referred to in the title. I would like to point out that in the referenced story from the Book of Mormon, Nephi and Laban are not brothers. They are somehow distantly related, but had not met previous to the events immediately preceding Laban's demise. How does this fact affect the overall argument of the book?"
1,This is ridiculous,What a crock of bull. I can't believe I spent money on this. These overeducated doctors need to find another line of work. Maybe a state mental institute!!! Don't wate your money on this book. I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR CUZ THERE WAS NOTHING LOWER.
2,"worked for awhile, don't expect to get it repaired","Bought mine in Japan for an outrageous price and after about 10 months, one ear-piece died. Thinking it was the earbuds, I replaced their (special)ones and found the problem to be the dongle. Customer support was friendly but, completely unhelpful as it was past warranty. I would have paid for repairs, but they don't repair, only replace. So now all i have is a mono-wireless-speaker adapater"
5,great piece for the price,i loved the birdbath.it goes together very easily and is ready in less than five minutes.i always love to shop at amazon.
2,Rusts,We have had this product for about 1/2 a year and it is all rusty and deteriorated in the bowl of the bath.
2,Nothing to Sing About,"I enjoy the song at the beginning of Reba's show, so I thought I'd order this album without listening to any of the music first. Shouldn't have done it. Nothing jumps out as a classic or a hit. I guess that's why I wasn't familiar with her music before her show came on TV. It all sounds the same, and it's not that great."
5,Reba NO 1's CD,The CD is brilliant and I would reccomend this CD to anyone - all easy listening by a very good artist.
4,"couldn't afford every individual CD, so...","A lot of the low-star reviewers claim fans already have all of this music. But many of these were first released as tapes, so some want to move up to CDs, and there are the ones over the years that you didn't get because you spent your allowance on another artist's album and forgot to get later when it wasn't front-and-center in the store.Yes, you only really need one ""greatest hits"" CD and many could get the MP3 of the new songs- but not every fan has purchased the previous ones (or wants to download the songs).So I regularly buy ""greatest hits"" CDs because it is more cost-effective than buying tons of individual CDs. Sure, not every song hit #1, but they are loved by fans and many are ones I'd have liked to have anyway! ""greatest hits"" are the songs that people hope the artist does when they go to a concert, and the added ones are likely ones that someone somewhere would be wanting- especially if they bought this for cost-efficiency!"
2,drek,"Sounds like a copy of a copy of skinny puppy. Is. Typical cookie cutter industrial, no new elements, blatant obvious tasteless samples. Who the hell samples interview with a vampire? Xorcist. I've actually heard scores of bands that sound almost exactly like this, the particular retardation of this band is the only thing that sets it apart. This band is a slave to the stereotypes of the subculture, coming off as goth as count chocula."
2,"Interesting art, but not much of a cookbook.","The cookbook part of this book had no impact on my life (not really that many recipes anyway). If you like surreal art, you may like this book. Full page surreal paintings with food items in them."
2,bad recording/mastering,"This is a compressed & flat sounding disc (refering to the 2 ch layer in the sacd), very disappointing."
1,Save your money,This is just a biography (unauthorized). It is not interesting and contains no music written by Dave. The music that plays in the background of the CD sounds like elevator music. If you are a big DMB fan I would save your money for their CDs and not buy this.
1,Anti-White Propaganda,"More of what we would expect from Samuel Betances. This man clearly hates White people and traditional society. He refers to the settlers who established the 13 colonies as 'illegal aliens,' for instance, even though they were not illegally entering a foreign state but rather settling in the wilderness of North America. He also refers to non-Whites in the USA as 'emerging majorities,' which is a true enough description given the anti-White immigration policy of the US Federal Government, however, Betances cheers this fact and is openly biased against White people - whom he wishes to see replaced. If you hate Whites, this is the book for you."
4,"""Hey what's not to like""","This one has it all and then some, ""Horse With No Name,"" ""Sandman,"" ""I Need You,"" ""Everyone I Meet Is From California,"" and ""Ventura Highway,"" just to name a few. Go with it...you'll be glad you did!"
3,Music's great but CD was scratched and won't play last half of songs,Music's great but CD was scratched and won't play last half of songs. The back of the CD had/has a really obvious scratch in it so I definitely don't recommend the party who sold it to me.
4,All their hits in one place,"This compilation has all of America's hits and is a wonderful listen. ""Horse With No Name"", ""Sandman"", ""Ventura Highway"", ""Sister Golden Hair"", ""Tin Man"", ""Lonely People"", ""You Can Do Magic"", ""The Border"". This is good soft rock from the seventies."
5,America,"If your looking for some of the best works of the early 70's group ""America"", then this is definately for you!"
5,RIP DAN,What can I say that hasn't already been said. America is America. Dan will be missed. A voice like this comes along once in very long while.REAL talent.
2,"What No ""Today's The Day"" again?","why is it that everytime ""America"" comes out with a greatest hits compilation they always leave off one of my favorite hits by them ""Today's The Day? This is the second time that I know of that this has happened.The first time it was left off of their ""History Greatest Hits"" compilation,and now this one.There really is no excuse for this.If anything why didn't they leave off some of their lesser known songs,after all ""Today's The Day"" was a charted hit.And ""The Border"" didn't even chart as high as ""Today's The Day"" did.I can't even recall ever hearing ""The Border"" on the radio.Bad move again on their label.If they wanted to do a complete greatest hits compilation adding ""Today's The Day"" would have made it more complete,and don't forget about their very last hit on Warner Bros. as well with ""Don't Cry Baby"" this has also been left off of both greatest hits compilations,and there really is no excuse for this."
4,I AM the casual listener,"I just picked this album because of Sister Golden Hair. Of course I was blessed with many other great songs. I'm not sure if this is the definitive collection, but if you enjoy easy going tunes that can be played in the background on a Sunday afternoon, this is a fine choice."
1,Just a note:,"Obviously, an anti Christian movie. Only one sceen (a few lines of dialogue) caught my attention. When the one guy looks at the younger blond female (trying to talk her in to going to his ranch) He says something like ...'I'd have you for a love slave...' He looks at her mother--the porn queen--and says something like '...well, I can always use more laborers...'That was it.If it hadn't been anti Christian, I would have given it a three--with a list of fixes for it...but not now.BYE!"
2,Just that OUT of touch.,"This group took one of my favorite songs and turned it into one of those drum machine me to death, copy-cat techno club type pieces of music. It's okay to listen to ONCE in a while, but not something I could stand to hear over and over again. Out Of Touch was a number one song for Hall and Oates...what did they do to it? All I can say is that if you can't sing, you don't sing Barbara Streisand songs right? Well, Uniting Nations should have stuck to something safer like Happy Birthday."
2,A little something for the dead...,"A cutesy-poo romantic comedy full of corny jokes and the kind of dumbass plot usually reserved for teeny-bopper movies. They're going after a middle-aged audience here, proving that crap is crap no matter how old you are. No kitsch value at all, just vacuous vaudeville by all involved."
4,Funny Movie,"My husband & I saw this movie on a Princess cruise when it was titled PLOTS WITH A VIEW. I tried buying it after I got home, but it was not available in the US, until last year, with the title changed to UNDERTAKING BETTY.It is rated ""R"", but I think it is wrong. There is no fowl language, but there are some scenes that young children shouldn't see. In this day and time, I would rate it PG-13.I have watched it three times and I still laugh everytime I see it. It is a typical British comedy with hilarious situations."
2,Pas pour moi,"A let down and disappointment after reading his novel ""Stoner"". This story is a rather boring example of ""A boy's swell adventure"" without much adult interest. I don't think the author was close to this subject. Some gruesome description of the slaughter of bison is not news to me but might enlighten those who still hold on to the myth of the west and its heroes. Such a contrast to ""Stoner"" which is brilliant and obviously an area close to William's experience and knowledge. I think ""Stoner"" is one of the best novels I've read in the last 60 years or so. Skip Butcher's Crossing and go directly to ""Stoner""."
2,......,"Well yes i go to a french school and, yes i know french. I finished reading this book and it is really not the same...I don't really like it at all...I mean, look at the cover!!!The English one is MUCH better because well just because!"
2,4.5 hp elec chain saw need big wire,Don't know if I will buy anymore with large HP ratings...you have to have large wire extention cords...like 10/3....or they burn up...this one did not burn up ..... but is not up to full power.
5,Cash,This is a great cd I'd recommend it to anyone who like Johnny Cash Music. It was a good value as well
1,Buyer Beware,"The software is out of date. It comes with a 3.5 diskette which my computer couldn't use. When I went to a store to try and copy it on a CD-rom, they told me that even if I copied it, the chances were that the program was so old that it wouldn't work on my operating system."
5,Attractive & Functional,"I love this bird feeder. I use it for feeding squirrels on the ground (minimizes their attraction to the hanging bird feeders!). Even though it is heavy, I find that I have to secure the base by burying it a bit or my furry friends will topple it. But birds would have no such problem."
1,An awful pasty mess!,I applied this product to my car according to the manufacturers directions. The pasty mess that was left behind took me hours to scrub off the car and I beleive it effected the way the ice polish reacted. Use at your own risk!
5,Liberty's Kids: Complete Series,"My boys (7 and 8) absolutely LOVE this series. We have only watched disk one and two - however, they would sit and watch it all if I let them. It's a great way to introduce American history and has led to many fascinating conversations. We also have headed to the library to learn more on two occasions. I purchased this on sale (under $30.00) and it was worth every penny! I may even pay full price - it's that good:)"
5,Great Video for Kids,40 episodes portraying historical events in a child-friendly and engaging format. Kids can't help learning from the three main characters about the fight for liberty.
4,The Jacksons,I've always loved the Jacksons and have supported them no matter what.Hey its the Jacksons - what more can I say.
5,Efficient,"The scale is good looking, light weight and very efficient--you type in the code for the product to be measured and, as you pour the ingredient into a container, the scale indicates the weight or volume needed!"
3,Loved it until I lost the paper..,I can't believe for the money this can't store the numbers and you just plug it in easier. For the ease of use this thing needs that paper. Well I moved and lost it and there's NO way of getting another. Of course you can print out a copy and be like 4 pages. Hassle. Besides you will never learn to properly measure with this scale.
2,The Truth About Celia,"Although I enjoyed the writing sytle of ""The Truth About Celia,"" the novel did not come together for me. I never understood what the various disasters, i.e. the theater catching on fire, etc. eventually had to do with the story of Celia. I enjoyed the story of the young magician and his mother (was she Celia in another dimension???), but never understood what this had to do with Celia.I hoped in vain that the story would come together in the end, but it did not. I'm very disappointed with this novel...good possibilities, but, finally, great dissatisfaction on my part. I Would not recommend to my family or friends..they would be disappointed too."
2,No Closed Captioning on 3 of 4,"I had bought these movies on their first DVD release a few years ago. I ended up returning all but ""That Touch of Mink"" due to lack of closed captioning contrary to the box labeling at that time. When these movies were released again in this 4 movie set I had thought the closed captioning would be there this time and did find the box claiming ""CC"" for the contents. Amazingly, they repeated the old errors so I returned the product. While checking the movies for closed captioning (or even subtitling), I noticed the overall quality of the movies is not good. It seems as no effort has been put into the reissue of these movies other than repackaging them in a 4 dvd set."
4,very close to his best...,"for me, rick is 21 is a wonderful rick nelson album. the hits are there, and also some other gems. though i would consider album 7 by rick is a touch better, this one is certainly worth the $20."
2,"Almost a great shelter, but has fatal flaw","I bought this shelter for a camping trip. I am a fairly experienced camper. I was ok with this thing weighing a ton (50 pounds) since you want a solid rain/sun shelter when you are camping to withstand high winds. Indeed, I was impressed with how sturdy this thing is. It is a very nice size (I actually bought the 15x15). It was also fairly easy to erect once you got the hang of it. BUT then came a rain storm, and this is where this shelter bombed. It has an air vent at the top that is designed to help it vent heat and wind, however it also allows rain to enter due to a bad design. So sad, if it just didn't have the top vent, this would be an awesome shelter. I returned mine to Target."
3,ENTERTAINING,"PRETTY GOOD MOVIE! I FOUND IT TO BE WEIRD AND ENTERTAINING! FRIENDS AND I WATCHED,WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH!"
2,Michel Legrand = Schmalz,"The sound quality of this recording is exceptional. I enjoyed the compositions, but Michel Legrand's strings ruined this recording as far as I am concerned.If you are a lover of James Last or Lawrence Welk, I suspect that you will love this recording. But I found the string arrangements were totally unimaginative, pure sappy schmalz. I just couldn't help but be irritated whenever I heard them."
4,Another sweet romance,"I like that this story put a hero that is imperfect in it. The hero had issues and fears that pertained to his childhood. Though we knew int he end everything would work out, we weren't sure how he was ever going to see the truth. It took a woman with a strong character and who spoke what she thought to get him to see the light of day. Sadie wasn't a weak person who needed a man to lean on. she was probably stronger than Andrew in many ways, in fact. Sadie knew what she wanted and went after it. The main weakness in her life was the way her father treated her, and we quickly see the relationship between her parents strengthen through God's love."
3,A difficult game. Pick Metabee version,"The game seems too dang hard. The Graphics are good, and the music is good. There is hardly a story, but the game play makes up for it. The one thing that changes the rating from a 4 to a 3, is the challenging enemies. One time, Both myself and my partner had not a scratch, while my enemy had almost no health. When I was just about to win, he does one attack that destroys my head, or uses a devastating medaforce (a special attack.) and kills me in one attack. That is just plain cheap. My recommendation, get Medabots AX Metabee Version. In there, you get the most powerful medaforce in both games."
4,Not light weight,"The scholar or academic may find this book quite engaging -- I'm just an amateur mathematician with an added mild interest in the history. For me, it's rather pedantic (over my pay grade as it were)."
4,"Ray Parker, Jr.-Chartbusters",Very good cassette. I'm glad someone had this since it was hard to find. I also wish this was out on cd.
1,The first premise wrong with this book is....,"The first premise wrong with this book is the idea that ""forty years ago morality in America has been in a state of rapid decline..."" - morality in America has always been about the same, ambiguous at best. Also, the association of morality and sexual practice is virtually evil, cutting people off from a big part of their personalities. The idea that America is a moral nation is another big evil; this is only a cherished ideal that has never been a reality, and certainly a huge impediment to getting on with living a life with real goodness to our fellow human beings and living an authentic life. Being reactionary (to Kinsey and other similar ideas) and to negate is, in fact, satanic (to hold you to your own notions) - actually, this is the one trademark of conservatives (and many Republicans): the spirit of negation and their savage need to condemn and judge."
1,One sided,"Yes, there are flaws in Kinsey's statistics and sometimes his methods were unethical. These two problems still exist today. But I think this book goes too far. There are no references to back up the ""facts"". It was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people's sexuality. It is published by Ascension Press, a religious publisher. Of course it is going to denounce his work. This publisher represents people who live by the bible and Kinsey's research does not follow the bible. So why does that make it wrong? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain."
1,ridiculous BS,"This book is utter crap. If you want to go back back to the dark ages, you'll love it. If you believe in science, biology, diversity, and human progress, read Dr. Kinsey's real work and leave this attack from the religious right where it belongs - on the dung heap."
5,"Unto the Sons, by Gay Talese",Another excellent book by this author. His research is impecable and the book is captivating. Definitely worth your time.
4,Interesting,Gives a lot of historical information in a novel. My favorite kind of book! Somewhat confusing at times.
5,"Quality, organic, and delicious","Tastes like real rice! I mix it in with a little applesauce or mashed bananas to help the texture and give more nutrition, and feed it to my 8 month-old twins. It also mixes quickly and easily into milk or formula for bottle feedings -- and those of you who know the immense hunger of large ravenous babies will know what I'm talking about! :)"
1,BEWARE!!,I have bought hundreds of items on amazon over the years but written very few reviews. I felt compelled to warn others with this cereal. I disregarded the other bad reviews thinking maybe they just had idiosyncratic reactions. My baby vomitted twice with this cereal two weeks apart. There needs to be an investigation with all these bad reviews.
5,Excellent first solid for baby!,"My 5 month old LOVES this cereal! It is easily digestable and does not cause constipation. As a mom, I feel great knowing my baby is eating organic rice cereal without any genetically modified ingredients. Excellent product and highly recommend to parents!!"
4,Heart of Darkness,"The unmasking of Serbian pathological drive for domination and grandomania are well documented in this book.We're given the eyes to see ""heart of darkness"" out of which maelstrom of Serbian mass murder whirled.A must read with only one flaw: partial bias of its Croatian editors.Yet, the words(ie.Serbian words) speak for themselves."
5,A Classic for Me,This album has been a part of my collection since I was in my early teens. Now in my mid-thirties I need it in my CD collection as well. Ron Wood is extending himself in this wonderful collection of his talented solo work.
4,Paul Revere & The Raiders-Greatest Hits,"Great CD, a lot of memories from growing up in the late 60s/early 70s. My girlfriends and I thought these guys were just so darn cute! A super CD!"
3,"""things are goin' groovy""","This cd brings back the good and the bad from the sixties.On this cd there are some good and some bad. The sound is not too bad so you will enjoy the rockers, the protesters and the stabs at the cal./surf sound. This cd really is all over the place but it's still fun."
3,5 stars SACD 3 Stars Music,"Telarc's SACD recording is 5 Star. This is elevator music. I'm almost old enough to remember the Beatles on TV. This is not them. This is Beatles ala choir and orchestra. Very Good, if that's what you were looking for."
4,Dog & Buttterfly,The Dog & Butterfly case was cracked on both sides when arrived. The CD was intact and the sound quality is still good.
3,Powerful People was hard to top.,"Gino Vanelli and his brothers Joe and Ross are some of the finest musicians I've ever heard. Their music goes deep down in my soul and leaves me wanting more. I do believe ""Powerful People"" (The album) was their best. ""Nightwalker"" brings back vivid memories of almost being fired when I worked for 100,000 watt FM rock station in Cape Canaveral, Florida when the album was released. As music director, I chose ""Living Inside Myself"" to be put on the play list. A new station consultant, however, disagreed with that decision and had the record pulled, accusing me of programming ""New Music"" (How else does it get to be ""Old Music?""). Anyway, now I play whatever I want whenever I want and Gino and his friends are high on my own personal playlist. I like the album, but none of them compare to ""Powerful People""."
3,It was OK but not for enterprise solutions.,Ditto on most of the comments. This book lacked depth in a lot of areas. Good for beginners but didn't help much with large enterprise solutions.
1,Waste of money,Some one has spent a large amount of time printing off screen shots. They've wasted their time and mine by doing this. WROX are bring out some great books with good techy stuff. IDG must try harder.
2,Too much marketing pads this book,"I opened the book to the chapter on Commerce Server, 441 pages into the book, and Harris was still writing as if he wanted to sell me on the program. Just the first 10 minutes of reading irritated me enough to write this review. I hope it gets better, but I'm not hopeful. Even if a book is filled with sales pitch -- is it written about Microsoft, or for Microsoft? -- it should end in the opening chapter. Once I've bought the program -- or the book -- I don't need to be sold."
2,"Good for setting up a site, bad for troubleshooting","Overall the book is very good at taking you through the steps to complete the site you create. Its very bad however at helping you troubleshoot when things don't go as planned. Perhaps some if this happens, do this type help. It also doesn't go into customizing the code to change how the site looks and operates."
1,Not much here,"""Bible"" is a bit strong.. This is more like a quick start guide with a bunch of screen shots. The book shows you how to install it and work with the sample sites, but really doesn't have the depth that you need to understand what site server is capable of doing. I hope there are better books out there than this one."
4,"Not a Bible, but a very good start","This book is a good start to understand Site Server and its features. The book as a whole is well organized. It is not a programmers guide, but is definitely the right book for beginners."
5,Everything the Diver wants to know.,"This is yet another of those books by the legendary Jacques Cousteau which were published in the early seventies and, in writing this series of reviews, I have found them to be as relevant today as they ever were.In this particular book we have underwater photographs of the highest calibre. In fact some are so good it is hard to believe they are over 30 years old. As far as the factual content is concerned, I would suggest this book contains everything the modern scuba diver would ever want to know about Octopus and Squid.Once again, I can only make the comment that this book is now out of print and only a small number remain available at this time. Having revisited the content after a gap of too many years, I still found this book to be an excellent read and I can only suggest all serious divers add a copy to their bookshelf before it finally becomes unavailable.NM"
3,Naket Marquis,"I am half way through and not much happening. The Marquis wants to get married to an old friend just so he will not have to face the marriage mart. Nothing about his caring about her. However, the two orphan kids he is responsible for are plotting something so we shall see. I liked the Naked Duke better, although a person has to be OK with a story there that deals with about any sexual disfunction you can think of."
1,Not sure which movie is worst.....,"I can not honestly say which movie is worse. King Kong Escapes has this giant robot Kong in it, and well forget it. King Kong vs Godzilla has the worst Kong suit ever made for any movie, and we see a lot of bad acting and effects work in each movie. Marketed solely to rob you or your money, YES. Buy it, NO."
2,camp,these movies were a saturday matinee in the city I grew up in.I have not seen them for quite some time so watching them again really shows how bad they were in terms of special effects.....but to quote a good friend of mine at least they tried......if you like bad camp...then this is for you
3,"50 % awesome, 50 % not so awesome","King kong escapes is pretty funny, but kinda long and drawn out. I only like the scenes where king kong fights stuff on mondo island and where Dr. Who's robo kong and king kong fight eachother. Watching it once was enough for me.King kong vs. Godzilla was way better, and way more hilarious. I've watched that one quite alot. The battles are great, and there are alot of really good minatures too.So, king kong escapes=ok but not greatKing kong vs. Godzilla=awesomeI'd say it's a good collection, recomended to anyone who enjoys this genre."
5,Extremely Beautiful!,"Traditional Odissi dance music is extremely captivating especially when performed by master musicians such as the Orissa Ensemble. This rare recording showcases the masters of Oriya dance and music - Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra (the master performer, mardala player, and teacher of Odissi), Sanjukta Panigrahi (his most eminent disciple), and Raghunath Panigrahi (Ms. Panigrahi's husband and premier vocalist). Highlights of the album include the Hamsadhwani ""Mangalacharan,"" the Sankarabharanam ""Pallavi,"" the jugalbhandi (sort of a competition between music and dance) in ""Yugma Dwandi,"" and the ""Moksha Nata."""
5,The best camping mat!,"The dirt goes right through it! We love this thing. When you get home you just spray it with the hose and let it dry. It weights less than 10 lbs and it is an excellent product, everyone we know who camps buys one when they see ours."
2,Not good enough.....,"These blankets were on my registry... i put them there after i read the reviews here. But on the very first wash, they began to give way around the edges and started to fray... very unsightly.I give 5 stars for the fabric...very soft...but the fraying spoils it."
1,A Travesty,"The author betrays his royal employers on every page, while boosting his own ego. Jephson comes across as vain, smug, and unforgiving. He seems resentful that the royals are merely human; always negatively comparing them to his own seemingly flawless performance. (""Somehow, I felt, [the success of the royal tour] would not have been possible without me..."") He accuses Princess Diana of complaining that ""nobody ever told her that she was doing a good job,"" yet the entire book is a prolonged whine from Jephson about how unappreciated his super-human efforts were by his employers. Jephson should be ashamed of himself -- this book is a gross betrayal of an employer who treated him fairly, if not as family. Better to read Mary Robertson's ""The Diana I Knew"" or her bodyguard's book."
1,HRH Princess Diana was so right,"How sad. Patrick Jephson needs several hundreds of pages to convince us that Diana was paranoid in not trusting almost anybody including her staff. But, o irony, this book is proof that Diana was right. A frustrated Jephson shares with us the most personal conversations he had with Diana. For money. It is a shame. Worse than what James Hewitt did. Don't buy this book!"
2,Pomposity & arrogance spoil whatever truth it may have,"Like most people I never met the Princess so it's hard to know the truth but this guy spoils it. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that much of what he writes is true but what a book! Jephson will praise the Princess in one line or paragraph but then he'll tear into her the next and still be writing about the same thing. It also appears that he claims to be responsible for much of what good the Princess did from planning events (or salvaging them)to writing most of her speeches. Such a smart guy, loved the good life too, no wonder she let him resign. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Mr. Jephson was hard to live and work with and would have been put out if he hadn't left. Charles Spencer says the guy was more interested in his bank balance than the truth. Patrick Jephson and James Hewitt are two of a kind, both traitors and business failures, who care about money more than decency."
2,Disappointing,"The novel, ""Shadows of A Princess"" by P.D. Jephson was a little disappointing to read. When I picked out this book I thought it was going to be full of facts about Diana that nobody was aware of. While some of the facts were new to me, others were not.The book though enlightened me on how difficult of a life Diana lived. She always seemed to be so happy, but this book really showed how troubled her life really was."
1,get help,"the 'hero' in this book is horrible and ridiculous. he needs serious help, and to be honest, so does the heroine. even when the hero knows he is wrong he doesn't appologize, but uses his position to coerce the heroine. AND SHE LETS HIM. come on, both of you, grow up.she should have slapt him with a lawsuit then left his company and done fine on her own - or some other ridiculously dramatic thing - because he deserved every bit of it."
3,A product of its time,"I love JAK and have read about 90 percent of her books. This one is a real product of its time. Today, Elissa would have gone to human resources and filed a complaint against Taggert for his bullying. However, when it was written society viewed the behavior in a much different way."
2,Get an English-speaking proofreader!,"I had this book on my Wish List, then found it through my library. I'm very glad I did not pay for it. I am not Iranian, nor is my family. I was interested in learning more about Iran's history and culture as background to some current news headlines. This book is FULL of information to be sure. But much of the ""history"" is simply chronology strung together, with no academic interpretation. Granted, Persia's history is extremely long and complicated, maybe the author was trying to streamline into one manageable volume. But what made the book unreadable towards the end was the grammatical and typographical errors in the text. Very simple things that for the most part do not obscure the meaning, but make the reading itself halting and mentally exhausting. How hard is it to have a native English speaker proof-read your work?"
1,He's not racially descriminatory!,Whoever says David Allan Coe just hates black people is crazy. I work at a casino where he often plays. The man hates EVERYONE!! They dread his arrival because he comes in and treats everyone like they're nothing. He once walked out of one of his shows ten minutes into it because there was air blowing on him from the air conditioner. I just can't take his music seriously knowing how he really is.
5,Awesome,"Don't be misled by a Country ""review"" from a new york city yankee. This is a prime collection."
5,A thorough overview on modeling and facilties design,"This is a great textbook in modeling. Even though, some chapters need a high level of maths to be understood and advanced models are really ""hard stuff""."
4,Great product,I like the product other than the chuck key itself. It does not sit on the gear like it should
2,Snooze!,"So very very very disappointed. As a former music educator (band, orchestra, etc), this was a complete snoozer. I couldn't even make it through without commenting on many of the bad aspects of it. The shocker to me was leaving out several key instruments, and playing SYNTHESIZER sounds for a few of the instruments. SERIOUSLY! My son couldn't even sit through it."
2,cute but disappointing,"Youngsters will enjoy the bright colors, movement and sounds this DVD has to offer, but an appreciation for the orchestra - I doubt it. If parents believe they are introducing their child to the world of classical music, which the producers would like you to believe, they are being duped. If they simply want entertainment, go for it."
1,Purposly screwed up!!,"Synthesized junk from start to finish. Most of the time the music doesn't match what you see being played, and the sounds are laughable. Even when the music matches what the musicians are playing (like the piano section) they over-dub a synthesized version... like kids prefer electric sounds to real instruments! Truly awful. I'm really mad. They had such an opportunity to be educational and PURPOSLY SCREWED IT UP!!! Save your money and go hear a REAL orchestra."
3,It's Basic,This book as with other psychoactive information books from Harvard University Medical School are great if you are interested in the history of the substance and just the basics. They are however the product of misinformation and a biased standpoint. I find ignorance is a common trait with these books.
3,One Night Stand could be better,"I lost my home recording of this event so I jumped at the chance for the dvd. I got it at Borders and watched it at home. The main things I wanted to see were the introductions of Mick Foley and Joey Styles, Paul Heyman's promo, and the Sandman/Tommy Dreamer vs. Dudley Boys main event. My only beef is that they didn't use the Dudley's wwe ""Drop the Bombshell's"" music, same with the Sandman's ""Enter Sandman"" music by Metallica. Those alone would get my blood boiling and rush the adrenaline. ECW was a short lived phenom to me. It was a lifestyle to the fans. And it was all in Bischoff's face!An excellent extra would also have been the invasions on Raw and Smackdown that they showed on ""Extreme Heat"" on June 12. Even better, they could've included ""Extreme Heat"" altogether on a seperate disk.Now, for future reference: This isn't for WCW! This isn't for Monday Night Raw! This isn't for Friday Night Smackdown! This certainly isn't for the WWE! This is E C F'N W!"
1,"Fantastic Pay Per View, Horribly Edited DVD","WWE have horribly edited the DVD release of ECW One Night Stand.They softened the crowd chants.They boosted the microphone track when the Raw & Smackdown guys were talking in the balcony. So now you can't hear what the crowd is chanting, but can hear Kurt Angle & JBL crystal clear.They removed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" song from Sandman's entrance, and replaced it with Ken Johnston psuedo-rock crap. Even though everyone in the audience is mouthing the words to ""Enter Sandman"".I'm sure there's more things I haven't found yet.Not Recommended."
5,This Is a defineing origin,"This a good origin story to the character it's also a prelude to Infinite Crisis.As we go there her past who was,how she came to be,And how she is now.Any one who wants to read the current Power Girl series must read this and if your going to read the Infinite Crisis story this is a must read first."
4,They're Good,"Definitely no plastic taste in any bottles I got. I purchased 2 from Lowes.They do not have a cap, but rather a 1 time plastic seal. Has anyone purchased a cap so they can refill these? Publix has a 5 gal refill for $1.50. I want to make that work but I will need to find a cap that fits so I dont spill it all on the ride back."
1,Primo is a ripoff,Primo does not allow you to return the empty bottle - unless you buy another one. So unless you keep buying their water the bottle ends up in the landfill. Not very environmentally friendly! And if you take the bottle to the store they will automatically charge you for another bottle of water if you want one or not. And due to Primo's unethical practices they will not let the store to refund the charge of the water even if you don't take the bottle of water. It is highway robbery if you ask me. So unless you are committed to owning that 5 gallon jug for the rest of your life don't buy Primo. You can find better water with better service at your local water company and they WILL take your jug back and give you your deposit back when you are done.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"The quick disconnect chuck is a good ""idea."" Unfortunantly the present design is flawed. The chuck cannot hold a drill bit to save it's life. Apply any pressure and the drill bit will simply spin in the chuck. Power is average. Battery life is'nt bad if you can get the rapid charger to work properly. If you do any serious project you need buy a lot of batteries and use the snail charger. I am presently returning my 5th rapid charger. I even bought them from different stores to see if maybe it was a bad batch of chargers sent to one store. Nope. Same problem, they work for a few days and slowly charge less and less until the battery is shot and the charger blinks endlessly whether it has a battery in it or not."
1,"love this product, didn't get it! Bait and Switch sale","This is product I love, wanted. Ordered it and instead got a gel re-curl which doesn't work, is heavy, greasy and I knew that and didn't even open it. It wasn't even packaged but taped with shipping tape at the bottom. Contacted seller, they refused to return for refund, but Amazon made it right. Don't use that seller. Bait/switch."
3,Everybody's movin',"The album is featuring Neo-rockabilly performers (Dave Phillips & His Rot Rod Gang, Shotgun, Honey Hush and Dave Travis Band) and legendary rockabillies from fifties (Eddie Bond, Mac Curtis and Janis Martin) who were performing live at the Rockhouse. On album are mostly covers of fifties classic tracks. Dave Phillips is the best!"
5,Evie Christmas tape,"I am happy with my purchase of Evie Christmas Memories. We have always liked her singing, so having her around this time singing while we are celebrating was a treat. Thanks and God bless, Rod"
1,Appalling Drivel,"I'm not sure who to blame. The Director, the Actors, the Script, the Sound, the Lighting , the fools who put up the money for this nonsense, or maybe it was my fault for viewing it?I spent the entire movie thinking, hmm, a lot of people got paid for this, there must be some redeeming feature.Alas, No. It starts dreadfully and plunges headlong into an abyss of talentless groping about in the dark and never sees the light of day.Tomorrow, I'll get up, find myself an Agent and announce to the World that I suffer from something lower than mediocrity and maybe they'll pay me a fat load of money to do Cavern II.Dont rent it, dont buy, dont even send it to your worst enemy."
1,All copies of this movie should be destroyed,"If you can even make it to the end of this sorry excuse for a movie, it is so dark you can't tell if he is killing her or raping her. And what happens to the other girl? Who knows, the movie just ends there."
1,Strobe Light Photography?,"By the time this film was 15 minutes old, my head was reeling and I could see spots before my eyes. I've never seen a more herky-jerky camera disaster than this one. It was like trying to watch a movie screen with a strobe light in front of you. But don't get me wrong, it gets worse. A mindless script, pointless plot, horrendous acting...and a nightmare on cave street...this flick is just a total loser. I never knew there was such a sport as ""caving""...which is the premise of this abomination. I quote: ""Everyone knows where the highest mountains are; the deepest seas, but the caves...the caves are the last unexplored frontiers on earth. There's nothing more exciting that that."" There is something more exciting than that...turning this film off after the credits. It belongs in a cave. Don't waste your time."
4,One of Tim Buckley's Great Ones,"Old Tim Buckley fans know he made some great albums and a few that were un-listenable. This is one of the great ones so, at long last, it was time to replace my scratched-up vinyl copy. Glad I did."
3,expensive but compatible with Burdic ECG machines,we have to buy this brand because somehow Burdic / Cardiac Science engineers made their EKG machines work only with their name brand electrodes and paper.The neutral rating is due to the high cost not the quantity of the electrodes themselves
1,Obsolete,"I purchased one of these a couple years ago. When a part broke, I was shocked to learn that this sander is obsolete and no parts are available. Be careful what you buy!"
1,Great idea -- bad clutch,"In one year, I have been through two of these. It's a good tool, nicely balanced, plenty of power, blah, blah. But don't buy one! The clutch on both of mine failed after a few months' home handyman use. Failed means the motor runs, but the chuck doesn't turn. Makes a nice paperweight, but no good for drilling."
3,"Curve Wave is very ""fruity""","I took a chance and ordered this product having never before seen/smelled/heard of it. This cologne is a little to light, airy and fruity for my liking. BUT I have received some compliments after wearing it so I will continue to do so instead of returning or throwing it away."
1,I SEE COLOURS ORIGINAL? INNOVATIVE? JUST ANOTHER SAMPLER,He has 33 intellectual property thefts to his credit used without permission and laughs at those he has taken from. Original. He nothing but a copier.I See Colours is one of these samples. What a joke he is.
5,Drew me into the Marshallese mind,"Originally from California, I have lived in the Marshall Islands, and I speak the Marshallese language. L'etao and other demigods were familiar as names, but Barclay's novel drew me much deeper into the Marshallese psyche. Barclay also captures the personal side of the controversial use of Kwajalein Atoll as a US army missile testing -- ""Star Wars"" -- site. This should be required reading for anyone -- Peace Corps Volunteer, teacher, missionary, health worker, etc. -- who plans to live in the Marshall Islands."
5,Time to feed the piggy!!!,"Cute gift. Bought it for my girlfriend after her other one fell and broke. This one will not break; it's made of durable, thick rubber. She loves it and thinks it makes a cute addition to her desk."
2,"Cute, but very serious design flaw","This piggy bank is soft, durable, and adorable, but it has a major design flaw. Because the legs are hollow and the plug hole in the bottom is surrounded by a lip, it's very difficult to get the coins out. Once you pull the plug and turn the pig over, all the coins spill and slide into the legs. The lip around the plug hole inside the bank also prevent coins from sliding out. The only way to get the coins out is thus to shake the bank violently. The only coins that come out will be those that hit the plug hole directly.This bank is wonderful for kids who want to look at it, but not for those who want to insert and remove coins."
3,"Cute piggy bank, horrible packaging","I bought this piggy bank for my 2 1/2 year old daughter after she knocked her glass one over and broke it. I was excited when I found this little guy online, he is adorable and seemed very well made. But when it arrived I was very upset because he was covered in green smudges! It was all over his head, body and legs, he even had a smudge on his ""bottom"" that looked very undesirable. I didn't even attempt to clean him, I asked for a new one to be sent out and it just arrived today. This one ALSO has smudges on it but not even a 1/4 as bad as the first one, so I used a magic eraser to remove them (95% came off). I think this piggy bank would have gotten a 5 star rating if the manf. would have better packaging!"
4,Ok,Ok product. A little bigger than what I was looking for. Came with smudges all over it won't come off. A little over priced if you ask me.
5,Very nice,"Purchased for my granddaughter. Nice product, big size and where it's rubber it won't break when she drops it.Would recommend..."
2,a good shelf decoration,"I found few things I could recognize and even fewer I could actually make. There were some like ""Kung Pao Chicken"", Spring Rolls, and Wontons but the things I eat stopped there. There were weird things like ""Squirrel fish"" and Frog legs. Most of the recipes centered on duck, squid and different fish and shellfish. I don't what aduience this book was intended for but I've always known that stuff to be very expensive. And I noticed the pork and cabbage dumplings only needed to be steamed. Where am I supposed to get a steamer? I think I'll stick to the stuff I was taught to make and keep this as coffee table fodder."
2,Fogs easily and hard to clean,"If you just want a mask that looks kind of cool, sure buy this one. But if you actually want a mask that works, get something better. The goggles fog way to easily. Everytime i play i have to stop at least once per game to wipe the goggles off so i can see. And if you do take a paintball to the goggles, forget it, you basically have to scrub it to be able to see through. Spend the extra cash and get something better."
5,Great Product for Cooling Hot Motors with Limited Options,"I bought this because I was having a problem with running too hot in regular driving on my turbocharged Supra. I couldn't fit anything bigger than a 16"" cooling fan on my new 3 row aluminum radiator. In the summer on certain days, I was was running too hot and coming very close to overheating regularly. I was hovering around 220 to 230 degrees when driving in traffic and idling. Without the option of fitting a larger fan, I purchased Engine Ice and have never had a problem since. My temperature guage was reading 3/4 or a bit more and now never goes above 1/2.The other benefit that made me choose Engine Ice is the fact that it does not freeze in the winter like other similar products or additives. So I don't have to drain all of my coolant and replace twice a year. Much less hassle and it works all the time.My only complaint is I think it's a bit pricey.Thank-you for a great product."
4,neither mastorbatory nor racist!,"The song ""Turning Japanese"" is a love song. It's about a guy with a broken heart and has become a different person to do this girl whome he is deeply in love with. The phrase ""Turning Japanese"" refers to becoming something different then what you are. Things like wearing different clothes or hanging out with different people or whatever crazy things women make us do for their love. Whoever thought of the idea that it is about masterbation has too much time on their hands, and that is apparently not all that's on his hands. Furthermore, to say it's racist doesn't even hold water. The song is about turning Japanese, not killing them. My rant is over."
3,Hit and Mostly Miss...,"Up until I bought this title, I have been pleased with the results of the Remastered Judas Priest editions. This title has it's problems: First the songs are too short with some of them being forgettable. There are only a few worthwhile: Hell Bent For Leather and Killing Machine, and sadly that's it. The remastering is dodgy at best, easily the worst I have heard so far. Sin After Sin which was done in 77 is far superior, go figure. Judas Priest fans buy at your own risk."
2,Beware - this is not a legit moneymaking or business guide,"The concepts seem to make sense but you end up realizing that this gentleman is only telling you what you want to hear. The author has obviously made his fortune with this neo-psychology nonsense. He bottom lines his only specific suggestion for financial success - network marketing. Sorry, author, but Ponzi-scams and Amway may qualify as 'business ownership' to you, but I think I'll stick with my day job instead of trying to con my friends and relatives. Like many other reviewers, I noticed that there is constant reptition of the basic concepts and theories.There is some merit in his 4 classifications of people, but I can't see how it would help someone get rich......"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is a complete waste of time.The author throws out a lot of buzz-words and little charts about ""quadrants,"" but he doesn't say anything specific. Much of the book seems to be a thinly disguised advertisment for other books and products of the author -- a la Wade Cook.Once you get through all the mumbo-jumbo, his ""advice"" consists of: (1) Start your own business, and (2) Invest in rental property (but only if it will generate a positive cash flow).Nothing too earth-shattering about either of the above. Unfortunately, the author doesn't give you any advice or practical suggestions on how to do either other than to find a ""mentor"" who is successul and is willing to teach you what he knows."
3,a simple concept too drawn out,"I liked his first book but this one was not as good. Kiyosaki is the only guy I know who can take one simple concept and turn it into a whole book. He uses too many diagrams to explain simple ideas which in turn take up the bulk of the book. He's a story teller and a salesman, not an analytical numbers guy. He's very short on specifics but loves to push his CASHFLOW boardgame and other products. He takes simple investment terms, twists them around, re-gurgitates it, and puts his own spin on it. His books are mainly motivational tools. That's it. Get up and do it! But I won't give you good advice on how."
2,Magazine Article Tortured into a Book,"I have read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and recommended it enthusiastically to many people. The simple truths there, though repetitively presented, were eye openers for me. This book is mostly a rehash of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, with approximately two sections of new material. It is very poorly written, extremely repetitive of information in the earlier book and so badly laid out from a design stand point that I was offended. The worthwhile new material, having to do with what type of investor you are and giving a step by step process for moving into the quadrants that lead to financial freedom, would make a good MONEY magazine article. The rest is padding. I guess you have to spend your money to get the new information, but you don't have to waste your time reading the whole thing. If you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, you can skim to the new parts without guilt and without worry that you'll miss too much."
4,Continuing the Lesson,"It just makes sense to read this after Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I have to admit it started slow and I'm glad I stayed with it. I found the continuing discussion of real wealth to be very insightful, challenging many of my previous beliefs about money and assets. Another point that really hit home:"" What others think of me is none of my business, what is most important is what I think about myself"". Another important reminder: ""Profit is made when you buy, not when you sell."" There is still time for me to make some changes in my financial dealings. More importantly, I will pass this to my college-age daughter and make sure she reads it. I urge you to do the same with your children or grandchildren."
2,Common-sense self-help pish-posh,"In this latest addition to his increasingly remunerative publishing career, Robert Kiyosaki serves up the same lessons he did in ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" reheated and recast but essentially unchanged in their main message. His particular genius lies in crafting a bald-faced marketing ploy into a series of best-selling books, enabling anyone to contribute to the ongoing Kiyosaki wankathon: just keep buying the innumerable spinoffs of his already impoverished ""Rich Dad"" hit, buy the sequels, the audiotapes, the games, go to the lectures... maybe you'll get rich too someday, but this book (and its like) won't help you get there. It's basic common-sense management advice that might keep you out of debt, but probably won't deliver you into fantastic wealth unless you've already got what it takes to get there. My hat is off to the author for getting so much mileage out of a few simple ideas."
5,Are you ready for the next level?,"If you loved Rich Dad Poor Dad, you'll love this book. Having read Rich Dad Poor Dad and taken action towards financial freedom, it confirms whether you are on the right track and guides you to it.If you have not started yet, it's an excellent book to help identify where you are at and which direction to go.For me, life is no longer plain and fustrating, but a fun and exciting journey.Thank you Robert for another unique gift. See you in Sydney!"
5,A Book For Success,"Excellent book to help you achieve success in all financial arenas. Get the principles shown here, apply them and get the sucess you want. Highly recommended."
1,I wish I could rate this lower - Kiyosaki is dangerous,"Anyone who tells you a house is a liability is wrong. Too many platitudes that sound good but mean nothing. Talk to a good CPA or tax attorney. If you are an employee & your corporation buys you a gold watch, that's income. What's more, the corporation used income to buy the watch. So if you are the corporation & you buy yourself a watch, you pay corporate tax on the corporate income & personal tax on the income represented by the watch. Foolish.A key indicator to me is the late nite infomercials this guy is running. Too good to be true.For a detailed ..."
2,"Owning is better than not owning, duh!","If you have time for one self-help book this month I would advise that you don't waste your time or $ on this one.The first RDPD book was insightful. This title is like a bad sequel to a movie. Think ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom"" or ""Ghostbusters II"".Here's the plotline. Owners and Investors don't think like employees (self-employed included). This could have been a chapter in his first book rather than a stand alone title."
3,"Very similar to Rich Dad, Poor Dad.","In my opinion, this book was almost like reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad all over again. It could be said it entailed more detail in the planning from the original book, but I can't say I learned much more from reading it."
3,Some good ideas,"This book contains a lot of good ideas. However, he leaves out enough so people will pay to come to his seminars and such."
4,Another great book.,"This book isn't as good as Rich Dad Poor Dad but still had some very valuable insight. I was glad that I picked it up and I would strongly recommend reading it.Ty WildeAuthor of ""Everything I touch Turns to Sold"""
4,Impression book,"I am a final year student of Marketing Department in City University of Hong Kong. I feel this book is not as impress as the first one ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". However, it still a book that is worth to read. The most imporant concept in this book is the four area to earn money. That is be employed, be self employed, business field and investment aspect. Rich people often come from the business field and investment.Actually, the main concept still ask us to learn more skill rather than find a stable job. That seems quite boring in the begining of this book when compare to the ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". However, nearly end of this book. The author suggests some steps for us to take action. One of the steps is to write down the name of six people that you spend lots of time with them in daily life. That's a great idea that we will discover something that we never think about it. In other words, it is a good book also."
3,"Repeat, reiterate, and recap x 50","Easy reading but I have to agree with other readers who commented that this book should be a pamphlet or should be in 2 chapters.1st quarter of whole book was repeating the same stuff over and over again with no new information. My suggestion would be to borrow it from the library and then if you think you must have the book, buy it."
1,Dont waste your time!,"This book is TERRIBLE! I wrote a comlete essay that took me 45 minutes to write; completely trashing every point of this book. Needless to say, it somehow didn't save on this site. Do I not have first ammendment rights, or was it a computer glitch? All I know is that I recieved feedback that stated my review was saved sucessfully. It amazes me that this book has such high ratings, and suspect there is ""funny business"" going on here."
1,Repetitious and boring,I found the same stuff repeating over and over again with nothing to say how actually to get money.
3,Much repetition,"First 3 chapters of the book were very good. The remaining hit me as re-hash. Maybe just where I am at, but I quickly lost interest."
3,The stories should mature,"I have read these books for a while, and have enjoyed even though they are totally unrealistic. I mean, these kids would have to be super-rich to afford all of the stuff that they do. However, they are books for little girls so they are allowed to be unrealistic. As to the repetitiveness of the storylines, I'm not a writer, but I think that all that needs to happen is they need to mature. They need more realism, like not being able to afford to go to shows, and having to sell horses, and dealing with other hardships that may not turn out o.k. The girls in these stories are pretty, have a perfect wieght and have boyfriends all the time. Why not make Lisa chubby or Stevie lose her boyfriend forever? just a thought."
4,Eyes close,"My 5 month old Corgi mix loves it so much that when she eats it in her Kong, she enjoys it with her eyes close."
5,Leadership Help for All,"This is a great read for any leader. The book could be easily read in an afternoon, but the principles will take a lifetime to master them. Great book!"
5,Courageous Leadership,"A great book for those who truly want to be leaders....My favorite part of the book is ...""Leaders challenge what is for the sake of what could and should be. That's the job of a leader. But challenging what has always been requires guts.... Next generation leaders are those who would rather challenge what needs to change and pay the price than remain silent and die on the inside"" This book for is for your leadership team if you are in an organization that wants to change but is lacking in courage."
3,"cool, if you like school and pool","great beats, they get a little boring sometimes. good background music and music to edit footage of your friends eating pie."
3,Not many good songs,Legend is where it's at. Buy Legend and Natty Dread and Natural Mystic. Buying this will just expand your bob marley collection. There ARE a few good ones and 20 bucks for 4 discs isnt bad but there are better Marley albums.
4,Good bolts for good price,"I searched all over the internet, and these were the best deal. Good product. I super glued the flights & tips to the shaft. Otherwise they come apart."
4,Pretty good for the money.,I first tried these out on a wooden target and broke two bolts. We then decided to make a target from cardboard and styrofoam we found in the trash. WOW! They nearly went all the way through the six inch target.Since then we have not lost a bolt.I will be buying more of these when the time comes.12 Aluminum High Impact Arrows
2,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this one, it's not worth it. They wind up breaking after a maximum of three shots. A waste of time and money"
5,12 Aluminum High Impact Arrows,It's is a good quality Item and very low cost!.....GREAT !....I'll buy again on the future!....I recomend!.....and ejoy great times!
2,Break easily,Although these seem to shoot much betterthan plastic bolts. It seems like every time Ishoot one the tail breaks off as its just gluedon plastic.
1,NO GOOD,"GOOD FOR ONE TIME USE IN HARD OR SOFT TARGET. plastic brakes right behind the metal. "" bad injection mold for plastic fletching ends. If you know how to make your own ends pull them off and replace them. Other than the the plastic they are A+. When it come to plastic if you see white hair lines in the plastic you should pass on the item. It means the molding process was poor. If you can get your hands on more of the bolts that come with the 80lbs cobra its your best bet. I have ordered the pack of 36 arrows rated for 50-80lb they are great for the money."
3,Ehhh... Could be better...,Just go these arrows today. Went out and used one to test them out and the first one I used it broke... The tail fin just came off.... I guess you get what you payed for since I got them for $3...
1,Everyone Broke shooting soft targets...,"1 Star because every single one broke when shooting soft targets. Shipping was about 1 week....decent.Half of them were loose (plastic rear of the bolt). These are a one shot deal basically. For the price, I'm not mad, but just for those who are reading these reviews, if you want some quality bolts/arrows for the Cobra Pistol Crossbow, get the ones with the PVC shaft's. Search for them here on Amazon, and read the reviews on those. I just ordered 3 orders of those (108 bolts total) for only $20 after shipping.Hope this review helps."
1,They break way too easy.,"I hoped that the aluminum body on these bolts would make them last a long time.The problem is the plastic insert. To put it bluntly, the break. I would not buy these bolts again unless they changed the plastic that makes up the fletching. A less brittle polymer would work fine."
3,unused,I never got to use the arrows because the crossbow i bought was a piece of crap. broke first time.
1,Paired with the wrong type of Bow,Frequently Bought Together But wrong size??? Why would amazon pair cross bow arrows with a compound bow? Yes I should read the entire description but I was Christmas shopping and wanted to get it done...
1,Too small to be of any use,"These bolts are too small to be of any use, maybe a target pistol , not for a larger crossbow"
1,Garbage. People who have trouble writing shouldn't write,"No offense, but this guy can not write. While his topic was interesting enough, he lacks the skills necessary to communicate in any effective way. Bad grammar, bad cliches, and bad conclusions are pervasive throughout the book. You will truly think to yourself, ""Am I reading an eighth-grade essay here?"""
1,Just Plain Bad,"When this novel was published a few years back, I was looking forward to it. After all, I loved Verne's classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. We all do, right?Then I read Paris in the 20th Century.... Well, it is indeed surprisingly prescient about future technology. But that's the only good thing to be said about it.The plot is flimsy at best, the characters have no appeal and the overall tone is one of self-indulgent whining. Incessantly so. Oh, how awful a world would be if certain poets ever failed to be lionized! The same list of poets repeated ad nauseum.In short, don't waste your time on this. If you want a well-written book that shows a dystopian future with a culture-technology clash, read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or Ray Bradbury's Farrenheit 451."
1,What is it supposed to do?,"I have been using these pads for a week now and I don't get it. I have noticed nothing. Really? What are they supposed to do because they are not doing it. The only thing I have noticed is that if you have a blemish and use it you can feel a little burn, and after use my skin feels sticky."
3,"ligh glow, but painful to sensitive skin","Like the other olay sunless moisturizer for the face, it creates a light sunny glow, however, it made my sensitive skin sting."
3,For Fans Only,"This album (Fuel) is a special import which makes it hard to get your hands on unless you are close to a nice distro that caters to rarities. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because even though I found it to be the least impressionable release by the ""mighty"" Raised Fist. Which dosen't really mean that it's bad at all. The album is long enough to give you a taste of how this band does their thing but the recording and the release overall isn't as good as most of their others. This is a must have for any long time Raised Fist fan but my advise is to get their overall best release ""Dedication"" as your fist buy from this band. Save ""Fuel"" until you get more into the band."
5,It's the truth,"I've been doing web development almost 7 days a week for the last five years. This book is a delight and would have saved me countless hours if it had been available sooner.Straightforward, clean, concise, thorough, basically what everone else is saying. The parts of the book with slightly deeper javascript programming will be best appreciated by those who have a background in at least one programming/scripting language; they are clearly explained and excellent but sometimes idiomatic in their brevity."
3,Emphasis on Cookbook,"The book was good, but definitely a cookbook style approach. I found it incomplete as a learning tool. While it gave examples and explained how they worked, there were a lot of things left lacking. You will be able to use examples from the book, if what you want is in there, and even be able to modify them, but to really learn to program javascript, you will need more.A good book to have on the shelf, but not a course textbook."
3,Size doesn't measure up,While I love the design of the shirt...the quality is okay but the SIZE is way off. I ordered an extra large because well... I'm not a small girl. This shirt runs very small. I would put it size as between a standard Medium and Large not an extra larger.Good quality...poor sizing. As long as you remember they run small it is a GREAT shirt.
4,"Not classic, but good","I liked this picture. It was along the crude lines of Dumb and Dumber or Kingpin. The film revels in potty humor, quite literally in fact, since a very funny scene involves Deuce and his bathroom attendent father. What makes this work is the original zany concept, and the film has heart. There is a genuine warmth to Deuce, and jokes work than those that don't. Worth picking up, and holds up well in repeated watchings."
2,If you are never going to be serious about woodworking....,"Black and Decker is the brand for you. As a neophyte woodworker without any guidance, I thought this was a solid brand. After mowing through various B&D drills, sanders, etc, I have seen the light. These are hobbyist tools. Unlike my other B&D purchases, I had time to return this one before I found out how lacking it was. This router couldn't spin any decent sized bits and bogged down easily on hardwoods. I would have to do miniscule increments on every cut. On top of that, the plunge mechanism would slip repeatedly. Returned it and bought another brand that I won't mention as this review is to warn you off this one - not sell another."
5,I could not set this book down.,"This was a great book. Besides all else mentioned already,it reads like a story. No theoretical arabesques, just nitty gritty factual details so you can see connectednesses for yourself. Baltzell's very factual illustrations of idealisms' realities and human tensions towards cultishness versus civic participation serve as a useful lense and compass to me ever since reading this book. I recommend it whenever I can, particularly to someone who, like me, may at one time, be shocked by a human experience or contrast and want to ask why. I'd recommend it to any one ever involved in a cult. Its readability is comforting and enthralling, and it is deeply seated in a sense of the continuity of history and human nature. I found it a healing book. I'm sorry Mr. Baltzell is no longer alive so I can thank him. Read every crumb of this book. Its thick, but allot the time."
3,Mosquito Magnet,"Its works and it doesnt work.The unit has to be placed in between your patio party and where you think the mosquitos are coming from. Wind diret affects this alot! It does suck them up, but our place is too windy and its always changing direction."
2,"Worked amazingly one year, keeps running but stopped catching","The first year we had our Liberty Plus, we were emptying nets FULL of mosquitoes on a weekly basis (by full I mean mosquitoes were literally packed in there so I had to dig in the net with a stick to dislodge them).I have had absolutely no problems keeping it running the second and third years. I just follow the manuals instructions. The problem is, it started making this howling noise the second year and the mosquito catch was disappointing. The third year the noise got louder and the catch dropped to nothing, so I shut it off and I'm gonna try for a repair, but from what I've read the company has new owners and it's unclear if repairs will be available any time soon.My recommendation: if you're rich, buy a new one of these every year and live a beautiful mosquito-free life :)"
4,Awesome traxx on this CD,"I have heard this CD and would like to buy it as soon as it's available here. In my opinion, this CD deserves no more than four stars because Tracid is great DJ/Producer but he is no DJ Taucher who is my favorite. Although both make different kind of dance music I still like Taucher's music over Tracid's. No offense against Tracid. He is awesome at what he does. Kai is a talented DJ/producer. His CD will keep you movin', no doubt. But I think Tracid need to get more recognition outside Germany's club scene."
4,Informative and clear,"I found this book very informative and clear. The author tells you the story of how the Samurai came to be with the intent of showing how Japanese Fudalism is not just an analog of Western Fudalism. I liked the book for its challenge to a widely held belief. It forces the reader to think and consider what one thinks they already know.I expected the book to be rather dry but was very happy to find out it is really a wonderful read. I recommend this to anyone who is already somewhat familiar with Japanese history, especially pre-Gempei War history."
1,This Model is a Lemon!,"After reading others reviews, I am somewhat comforted to know I am not the only one disappointed with this monitor. The screen cannot be adjusted to correct ""bowing"" and other distortions. Customer service was no help whatsoever, and based on others experiences, I am glad I decided to just hang on to it despite its annoying defects. On the plus side, the colors and picture are okay. But this particular model is inherently dysfunctional based on all these similar complaints. A true lemon to avoid."
1,Don't buy it!,"When I got it, there were strange problems with the screen turning itself off and on. Now it won't turn on at all and I've had it for only 7 and a half months!"
5,A must for a golfer's library,"I was skeptical about the claims made by others regarding the information found in Mr. Novasel's book, ""Tour Tempo."" I learned of the book from another avid golfer. I decided that I would give it a shot and purchased the book. I have been working with the CD and book for roughly three weeks now. I play two times a week. Before digesting the information, I was shooting in the mid to upper 80s. I am now shooting in the upper 70s and believe that with additional tempo work I will see my score decrease more. The book is well-written and easy to understand."
5,HYSTERICAL,"The Onion has done it again!After three hysterical releases of Our Dumb Century, Finest News Reporting, and (my personal favorite) Dispatches From the Tenth Circle, The Onion has published a cry-out-loud-it's-so-funny book filled with satire on many subjects-ranging from September 11th (Hijackers Surprised to Find Selves in Hell) to religion (God Diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder) to fast food (Developmentally Disabled Burger King Employee Only Competent Worker). However, if you are easily offended, don't buy this book. Somewhere or other within these 264 pages of sheer brilliance, you will get offended. Otherwise, buy it without a doubt, as well as the other Onions. You won't be disappointed."
4,Outstanding read,"This novel works on many levels. As a top notch thriller, as a character driven novel, as an introduction to both Hindi and Muslim Indian culture, as a thought provoking science fiction novel, with an interesting look at what the future might be (No, where is my jet car? We're all supposed to have jet car thing), in a realistic manner. At close to six hundred pages, if you have the time to wile away the last of summer with a great read, I would recommend it immensely."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"It is rare for me not to finish a book, but this is an exception. I was really excited to get it, as it came highly recommended by a blog I read, and I have an interest in Indian culture and science fiction. After slogging my way through half the book (it'll get better, won't it?) I must admit I put it aside. It's not that I mind reading large books (Neal Stephenson's ""Diamond Age"" left me wanting more) but I found nothing to hold my interest here.Set in India apprx. 50 years in the future, each chapter is devoted to the point of view of each of several characters- a gangster, a cop, a politician, journalist, scientist, etc. None of the characters seem very likable. I assume their tales will eventually converge at some point, but nothing about any of the characters or the story line compelled me to want to keep reading.In short, though I found the premise of the book fascinating, in reality it just didn't seem worth finishing."
4,for the techno-brahmin in us all,"I have to give Mcdonald serious points just for the audacity of his vision. Writing India can be next to impossible, and he uses Sci-Fi effectively (albeit heavy handedly) as a way of commenting on a region fractured in ways too numerous to count. The book is at its best when McDonald uses Stephensonesque tech concepts to exacerbate this tension. Mcdonald's prose fluctuates between the prosaically matter of fact, and the oddly lyrical. It's a sprawling, occasionally messy, jubilant juggernaut of a book. It's refreshing to encounter Science Fiction that is not firmly rooted in an American or European setting."
2,Tries to do too much,"I love the concept of this work, and loved reading it for the first 200 pages. I barely finished it and yet still maintain that it is a great story. The work as a whole however collapses under its own weight.The culture of India is unique and different. I GET IT. I don't need to be hammered with the idea ever third sentence. You're clever and use a lot of Hindu words. I GET IT. I like a challenging novel as well as anyone, but this was too often like doing a crossword.As it happens I just finished a fantastic execution of the same sort of idea. The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi. I'd never heard of him either, but his latest hits the target that River of Gods misses by a mile."
5,captivating in a quite nice way,this book smoothly coalesces separate story-lines into one and slowly builds its story until it releases the climax in an excellent way for a rather delightful read.
5,Amazing acting,For a movie that probably cost $500 to produce (not counting the actors' salaries) this movie is absolutely great. The cast are all top actors (at the time of production) and you can certainly see why. In fact this is said to be Fonda's favorite of all the movies he was in. I highly recommend it.
3,What's the Point?,"We buy Leonard's book every year, always the $20 edition for the larger type. The reviews were the same as always, informative, mostly accurate. Sometimes he's just plain wrong, but what critic isn't.The problem is that this year the print got smaller and lighter and we can not read it comfortably. Since I have two more decades before I am officially ""old,"" I wonder when publishers are going to clue in to the concept of ""physical readablility."""
5,A Garfunkel Gem,"I believe I own every Art Garfunkel CD except for Lefty and, without a doubt, Fate for Breakfast is one of my absolute favorites. Art is, of course, in fine voice as usual, and contrary to some other reviewers I think producer Louie Shelton pushed all the right buttons on this project. Far from being sappy, the arrangements compliment Art's beautiful tenor voice. While I am hard pressed to pick a favorite song on this CD, gotta go with Miss You Nights. While I respect Cliff Richard as a vocalist of great repute, Art really hits this one out of the park, and coupled with the inclusion of Bright Eyes, Since I Don't Have You, Beyond the Tears and When Someone Doesn't Want You, this CD is a treasure and a must for any Art Garfunkel fan."
4,Beautiful and simple sweaters,"This book is a must have! It contains beautiful but classy knits that looks great on children. And the sweaters fit well too. I made a number of sweaters from the book, but I love the cover sweater best. It's chic and elegant and easy to knit. You only knit one piece. The only reason I only gave four stars is that the book doesn't tell you how to make the ribbon rose ""button"" and how to attach it to the sweater. I also knitted the stuffed rabbit toy, which was simple, but the finishing directions were too confusing. My rabbit ended up with a floppy head, but still very cute. And, I realized that I should have washed it before stuffing it. It would have been great if the directions had said that."
5,I love this book!,"I really have enjoyed this book. I have made so many baby sweaters from it for gifts and charity auctions. The instructions are very easy to follow and it has a variety of sizes, from 0-3 months - 12-24 months."
4,Special Indeed,"LOVE this book! Everything is simple, but with the smallest touches to make it specialAlso a wide range of skill levels. Directions are clear and easy to followSome of the knits are a bit... blocky? But end up wearing well for the most part, and could easily be altered to suit individual needs if necessary.Yay Debbie Bliss!"
3,"Good product, poor customer service","The product was as expected, however the shipping was poor. The product when shipped was not taped, it was just dropped in a plastic sleeve that was not sealed. This resulted in it getting dirty and stained during transport. Hopefully I can get the stains out, if not I guess I will just live with the product the way it is since no effort has been made to correct the problem."
5,You will buy this cd...you will buy this cd..I repeat...,A super effort by Mr. Suhler and Monkey Beat. An eclectic cd to be sure...a little cajun style..some sit down blues but best of all...Restless Soul and Scattergun....if you could wear out a cd by playing it over and over I'd be on my 100th copy. You could do a lot worse but if you like hard drivin rock/blues you can't do much better.
5,Great Generator,"I've owned and used this generator for 7 years (bought it at Home Depot). Typically starts on the second pull and produces enough electrical power to get me through extended power outages ""comfortably"". However, I'll grant you that it is noisy."
1,simply dreadful,"This book contains almost no information. It is simply a series of photos of the author with famous boxers. I believe, but cannot be certain, that it is self-published. A total waste."
4,It works!,I was a little leery to try this after the 2 not so great Amazon reviews but my husband went ahead and bought it so I gave it a chance. I am happily surprised with the results! We sanded the wood surface really well and then rolled this on with a foam roller. It went on great and after 2 coats magnets work. I put on 2 coats of chalkboard paint on top of this after it dried and the magnets still work. (I was concerned about it not working after the chalkboard paint went on). I didn't find it that hard to mix up either. We just gave it a good shaking and then stirred for a minute after opening and it was great.
3,Reading Pictures? Where are they?,"I agree with the last reviewer that the quality of the paper and the type of print are very off-putting. But more than that, where are the pictures being discussed? For Joan Mitchell's ""Two Pianos,"" the main subject of chapter 2, I had to put down the book and go to the Internet to find a reproduction of the work in question! He does much better with Marianna Gartner - in fact, in that chapter we are treated to half a dozen of this artist's paintings, some in color, albeit not very good reproductions. The chapters are uneven in the handling of the material: the chapter on Gartner is very thought-provoking while his chapter on Picasso is nothing if not predictable. I would have been willing to pay more for the book and would have enjoyed it more had the paper, the print and the quality of the reproductions (think ""glossy!"") been better."
4,Hard to clasp,"I agree with my fellow reviewer. It is hard to clasp. Also, the necklace looks a lot like a fancy dog collar. Still, both pieces ""go"" great to dress up jeans and a jacket"
4,HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS AUTHOR,"HAVING WORKED WITH THE MENTALLY ILL I FOUND THIS BOOK A FASCINATING LOOK INTO THE MIND OF SOMEONE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER. A VERY LIKEABLE CHARACTER. AN INTERESTING STORY WITH PEOPLE I WANT TO CONTINUE TO READ ABOUT, COMING TOGETHER TO HELP A CHILD. THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL MYSTERY, SEEMS TO GO BEYOND THAT TO GIVE A LOOK INTO NAVTIVE AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE MENTALLY ILL. COMES TOGETHER IN A REAL INTERESTING WAY. I READ IT AND THEN WENT AND BOUGHT THE NEXT ONE IN THIS SERIES. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS BOOK."
3,Difficult. I am not in a position to comment.,"I read up to Prop 6 and could not quite carry on. His language is not easy to understand. I hope someone will publish a Dictionary of it. Anyway, his proof of Kepler's 2nd theorem is clever, and he is very rigorous mathematically for his time. ..."
5,does what it is supposed to do,This situp bar doesn't have any bells and whistles but it does exactly what it is supposed to do and for that I give it 5 stars.
4,A Good Field Guide,"This is the best field guide available for plants growing in the Florida Keys. However, there are still some flaws in it. It lists several species that are not native but rather naturalized invasive exotics. Also, I've found some of the botanical names are incorrect.All that being said, it is still better than any other guide published, and that includes several handouts provided by the local state parks. It's too bad there is so little compiled information about this very specialized and unique ecosystem."
5,Don't put off putting this to work for you,"I admit it...I'm a procrastinator, and I need help! Thankfully I found this planner. I've looked at other guides and books, and while they had some good content, ultimately they left me feeling flat. But this one is both fun and informative. It is written in a humorus tone yet packed with a lot of facts and figures that I think will be very useful as I plan out the coming year. The book is easy on the eyes, with a retro animated style that I find very appealing. I recommend this to anyone like me who needs a playful nudge to get them off the couch and on to getting things done."
3,Not Compatible With T-Outliner,"I don't know how well these combs work, but they DO NOT work with the Andis T-Outliner. Amazon will suggest this item in a combo special to buy with the T-Outliner, but they will not fit."
1,"Not as advertised, didn't fit, company will not respond","This product came from the business ""Beauty 4 Family"". The product arrived in time, but did not fit as it was not described well and did not identify which clipper models it would fit. It just stated it would fit Andis clippers. Not So!!! I have tried repeatedly to contact this company only to find there phone number is not valid, I have e-mailed them and they have not responded. I would not recommend either this company or this product as you will not know if you have a clipper they will fit until you get them. If they don't fit, don't expect any help from ""Beauty 4 Family"". Amazon should disassociate themselves from this company. I have never had problems with Amazon so find it problematic that they are supporting this type of business."
3,combs,they were all right there weren't the best. I thought that the andis clips were going to be a bit different.
2,Stops clippers,"Stops clippers from cutting when pulled all the way down. I thought the clippers broke, but it was just the guards interputing the blade flow."
2,Not Really for The Clipper They Are Advertised For,They don't fit the clipper in the sense that when you set it to the shortest possible the blade will eat away a little bit of the combs.
3,These don't fit the regular T outliner. It's Amazon's fault for reporting the frequently bought together combo.,Got the T outliner clippers as a gift and saw these blades as frequently bought with the original product. MISTAKE!!! = Amazon's and mine (for trusting the targeted ads)
2,"Should be called ""Cordless Screwdriver""","For a 12V drill, it certainly lacks sufficient power for common drilling tasks. With the clutch torqued all the way down, the drill choked trying to bore out a 2 1/8"" hole through a hollow-core door. After five minutes of backing the bit out and back in, the chuck started slipping, rendering it useless. A two-minute job eventually took 20 minutes. It works great as a screwdriver, though. A bright orange, $70 screwdriver. For people installing bookshelves and hanging pictures, it's a fine tool, but for serious users, go buy a Milwaukee."
1,drill bit slippage galore,this thing couldn't hold a drill bit if it's life depended on it. it's been relegated to driving screws with the hex head.
2,Howard Miller has not been consistent.,"The color was no where near as pictured; it was more a walnut and not at all what I wanted. A disappointment, but as always, Amazons return service was fast and efficient."
1,Keep looking,"I purchased one of these years ago when they first came on the market from the local Lowes. Worked great and loved the hose guide and the covered bin to store some tools. When it finally gave out I looked everywhere for it and ended up here at Amazon, where I knew I would find it at the best price around and have always found Amazon's customer service top notch.However, the same cannot be said for Suncast. Immediately I could see the quality had gone down hill over the years, cheaper and thinner plastic, rickety even. But my husband and I hooked it up anyhow only to find that it leaked. Not at our hookups but inside the reel, not to be fixed. Had Amazon come and get it the next day for a full refund. Thank you Amazon for being such a great company.Have read countless reviews on hose reels and they all seem to have issues. If anyone knows of a decent hose reel for a decent price please let me know."
3,Not his best work,"September Morn was released in 1980 and went to #10 on the US Billboard Album 200 charts. The cassette went Platinum. Only two singles made it to the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart: September Morn' #17 and The Good Lord Loves You #67. I know he wrote the song for the Monkees; but his version of I'm A Believer is not the good at all. I belong with most on this; if it isn't broke then why fix it. Even with Stagger Lee and Dancing In The Street, Neil Diamond renditions are not that great. Overall I did not think it was that great. This is a C- at best."
2,Very Uneven and boring,"Starting with September Morn, all of ND's CDs have been very uneven and this is one of his worst. This has a few songs that are listenable and the majority is so BORING!!!! I wish they would put out Greatest Hits Vol. 3 with all of his great songs since September Morn that aren't on Vol. 2 including That Kind, The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, On The Way To The Sky, Right By You, The Drifter, First You Have to Say You Love Me, Front Page Story, Heartlight, In Ensanada, Turn Around, You Make It Feel Like Christmas, Sleep With Me Tonight, The Man You Need, Story of My Life, It Should Have Been Me, (I'll See You On The Radio) Laura, Me Beside You, Best Years of Our Lives, This Time, If I Couldn't See You Again, If There Were No Dreams, Don't Turn Around, Hooked On The Memory of You and a couple from Tennesse Moon and Three Chord Opera. Now that would be an AWESOME CD and you wouldn't have to waste your hard-earned money on awful CDs like this with only a couple good songs!!!!"
2,September Bore,"A truly disappointing effort from a talented man who had run out of things to say by the late 70's. His rendition of ""Dancing In The Street"" is horrifying. Luckily some of the old magic returned on his next release, ""The Jazz Singer"""
4,For All WW Fans,"4 stars for the content of the book itself - beautiful pictures, interesting back story and fun trivia. Great for anyone who loves the show.3 stars for the quality of the copy we received. It was sold as used ""good"" condition, but last third of the book was water damaged and wrinkled."
5,I got it!,"very nice t-shirt!, it just took one week to get it from usa to Chile (south america), so i`m very happy with eastbay's and amazon's performance."
5,So much fun.,My daughter and I love this and we have so much fun playing it together. It has great questions and really helps her learn. Great buy.
1,"Willy & Leon, One for the Road","I paid $2.49 + Shipping and feel ripped off! Extremly tired and uninspired It's a lot of old standards that might be fun for a audience of 70 to 90 year olds in Tulsa, Ok. But from to veteran road worriers, it was really disappointing...you can't tell who's singing, no imagination. This could easily be two guys who do C&W Covers in Local Bars frequiented by local convalesent homes and supported from one of their mostly senile Clients."
2,A generic adventure for the Doctor...,"Ace has been away from the TARDIS for three years when events and time conspire to make her desire to return to the Doctor. Using a piece of technology, she links to the TARDIS, but one much changed from her time there: the Doctor has lost his memory and Benny is in hiding for her own safety...This book is a bit of a worry. It's purpose appears to simply be to return Ace to the TARDIS crew and to tell a mildly Dalek-related story (odd, since Virgin didn't have the rights to use the Daleks in their books...). It also features Absolom Daak, a charcter from the Doctor Who comic series, who is a Dalek Killer!Despite all these Dalek-related issues, the story has little to do with them. Instead we are served up what amounts to a generic Who opponent, who is defeated in a generic Who way.A lack of true creativity dooms this book to being, at best, a second-string novel in the long line."
5,The critics bite the big one on this CD,"I believe this CD was panned by most of the nationally known music critics. They are wrong. It has been many years since I've listened to this CD, but the songs stick with me. The songs are very melodic from the first cut to the last, and Dylan has something to say, and says it well. I am not a practicing Christian, so that has nothing to do with me giving the CD high accolades, it rocks."
4,"You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy.","This album by Bob Dylan was released in 1979. The entire album is about Dylan's then recent conversion to Christianity. It is very well perfomed, with great guitar work by Mark Knopfler. Dylan is obviously very serious about his newfound faith, with some very passionate singing. This is a solid album, but Dylan fans that aren't Christians may not enjoy it too much."
4,Slow Train Comin',"It is the truth that every one of us knows that there is a God and that we need him, but unfortunately we all supress that truth in one way or another because it tends to make us extremely uncomfortable. We like to at least feel like we are in control of our lives. This is the wrath of God, that he gives us over to ourselves. Well, Bob Dylan decided to recognize God's control over his life and he sings about it! The music is great, but I will admit that Dylan's lyrics do not measure up to the depth of many of his previous albums, which is unfortunate because knowing God reaches the very depths of the human heart and mind. But Dylan tends to sing giving his opinions, and this album is no different, except that hope is found throughout them."
5,Sooo relaxing!!!!,"I enjoyed this foot spa very much, because it stays warm for a while, you can use bath salts, and the bubbles feel great. Although if you turn in the bubbles it doesn't stay as warm as with the vibrations. I recommend this product."
2,a little dissapointing,"I was hoping that this would keep the water warm, but it doesn't. After about 20 min the water is cold. Also, if you want to use the air, the unit is very loud. Too loud to watch TV while using it. Other than that it works."
1,Not a Good Product for the Money; No Bubbles,"I read the other reviews, but I was hoping I would get lucky and get a working foot spa at a low price. Maybe I'll have more luck next time. The right side of the spa does not bubble. A very disappointing discovery right out of the box, especially since I was planning to give it as a gift. I know this is a low price, but I think that regardless of price, products should work as advertised by the manufacturer. I recommend you buy something else."
5,The best johnny O cd,"This cd contains all the best Johnny O hits any freestylefan would ever want to hear. The only exception was that theproducers forgot other of Johnny O's greatest songs such as ""Runaway love ""among others. Overall I think that this cdwas made very well."
3,Didn't like the editorializing,"Any book which I feel compelled to read a second time is definitely worth reading, as was the case with this book. It was a very interesting case of how an older, stronger, more intelligent brother manipulates his less-adept brother into killing his wife. However, I've read dozens of true crime cases and never before have I seen one which includes this rather strange editorializing by the author. She includes paragraphs, oftentimes in italics (but not always)which seem to be her attempt to make this writing more like a fictional story rather than a true crime case. Most of these include things that the author couldn't possibly know, such as thoughts the victim had on her wedding day; casual conversation between detectives that wasn't pertinent to the case; and what the murderer was thinking. I really don't think that she actually had a conversation with murderer regarding how he felt irritated that his mother hadn't put his clothes away after she laundered them, etc."
1,This Book is Not Good For Young Children,"My son is having nightmares because of this book. He found thisbook in the 1-5 public grade school library and also at the schoolbook fairs which promotes this book.It is not appropriate for ages 9-12, in spite of what the author says.The front cover even give us the willies, and we're adults!Parents beware what society is presenting to your kids!""Secret portholes, evil goblins, magical battles, brave knights,lost jewels, enchanted forests, and the likable heroes running for their lives.Round Table includes character cards of strange and amazing creatureslike goblins and fairies, ten-sided dice called knucklebones............""Come on!""........... they are trying keep the horror movieindustry alive by starting with your young kids."
4,Sandi Patty Orchestral Suites,"This is a collection of David Clydesdale orchestral suites of Sandi Patty songs (1979-1986). These tune suites were played as concert preludes and during intermissions of Sandi's ""Make His Praise Glorious"" concert tour (1988-89). There is little development in the suites but for Sandi fans, this is a sweet haunting collection of Sandi's Songs for orchestra from the orchestrator who put together most of Sandi's famous high-note arrangements."
3,Berarded dragons,I always dreamed of getting a bearded dragon but my folks didn't want me to have one because she said i wasn't responcible enough. how much work does it take to be a dragon owner?
4,Zanardi does not disappoint,"Alex Zanardi was a truly inspirational competitor on the track and one of the best characters off it. His fightback against crushing odds and his chase to have his life back at normal are inspirational and uplifting. For those who marvelled at his CART days and wondered about the disappoint at his F1 with Williams, there is some explanation here. There is no doubt that he is an exceptional driver and even more so an exceptional human being. He is now racing in the world touring car championship for BMW."
5,amazing,"My mom had this book when I was growing up, and it opened my eyes to drug abuse early on, when i was too young to understand that my father had a drug addiction. I wouldn't be the responsible person i am today without this book."
4,Good addition to your Die Form collection,"This is a strong album by Die Form. If you are new to Die Form I would pick up one of their ""best of"" albums first and save this for one of your next purchases after that."
5,HUsband loved it,"It was part of a CHristmas present for my husband and he absolutely loved it. Great quality, quick shipping, very satisfied! Thank you!"
3,Pretty Nice Considering ...,"I was very pleased when I received the order in the mail, but after I washed them out and put the covers on the largest container's top wouldn't fit right. The two smaller container lids fit perfectly and you can hear the air being displaced when putting the container tops on. I guess I'll live with the ill-fitting large container top. It's an inconvenience sending them back now. They are beautiful and definitely RUBY not RED."
1,Big disappointment,Way too small to be practical. I wanted a set that could hold standard bags of flour and sugar. These don't fit the bill.
1,Cheap and Nasty,Should have taken note of the reviews! The seals don't fit the containers properly and it would have been such a hassle to return. How can you return unopened item if you need to open them to look at!!! Oh well my bad!
5,Beautiful red canisters,Love the clay texture and the different subtle design on each. Is a wonderful accent for my kitchen. The lids seal well and the construction is just perfect.
5,Versatile Every Day Carry Camera,I carry this V705 all the time. It's done a great job taking panoramas from roof tops and macros of flowers. Use the presets for these settings and you'll get a great image. I don't get the great image quality I do from my high-end Canon but I get the shot and can usually clean up sharpness or exposure in Photoshop. One surprise was the quality of the video. Amplified music looks and sounds great. You really need a 2 GB SD card to do video though. I also had to find the small Case Logic $6.99 padded case to protect the camera against all the dings from my keys. The case is still small enough so I'm not discouraged from taking the camera with me. Pulling the camera out for candid shots is silent and quick - kind of like the old range finder days. The Schneider lenses are really excellant even at the small size. I'll probably wait and see what the next generation looks like in this category and decide if I should buy another V705 as a backup or not.
4,fun quotes for the non-theist in your life,"I have enjoyed reading through this and connecting with some great minds through out history.I have picked up a copyer here on Amazone and a few at local book stores and the like. I get the extra copies to leave places or give to someone taht tells me some thing like ""No Atheist has ever done the world good"" I let them read quips and quotes from great minds that have brought us the world we know and live in today, well the good parts of the world at least."
5,Excellent,A very important topic and an excellent presentation of this important and relevant history. Well done. A simple catalogue of what was said by a few of the worlds greatest thinkers and writers and their utterances on the topic. I will buy several more to give as gifts. It needs to be widely read and shared.
2,I Don't Get Itr,"I can never figure out why people who seem to hate Poe's work insist on writing books about him. This book contains a critical analysis of Poe's work, and therefore is worth reading, but Hoffman doesn't really seem to like Poe's work very much. He is overly critical of Poe at nearly every turn. You'd really be better off reading Poe himself."
2,Poor Design,Stay away from this product as the hinge is of poor design and when it fails will crack the plastic housing the screen. Polaroid will not stand behind this product or repair it when out of warranty. They will offer you a replacement for $150.00 with the same results. Stay away and find something else !
4,Great Lyrics,"I think this song is a great jump-start to a party!Lyrics wise is awesome..music though hmmmm....not bad sounds a little commercial if u will. All the remixes are good.Radio Edit- 3:46Original Club Anthem- 11:52 [favorite]Ralphi's Vox Mix- 7:37Dj Paulo's Remix- 8:35Michael T Diamond's Remix- 9:06If you liked ""Dive In The Pool"" then most definitley you will enjoy this song ""I Got My Pride""Pepper Mashay for those of you who don't know, was the voice for ""Dive In The Pool""Go Buy It!! You will enjoy!!!"
3,guitar strap,A good deal for a beginning guitar student. Perfect for a 1/2 size guitar. A little too flimsy for a full size classical guitar.
5,A gem - just rediscovered,"Back in 1979, when the Mothership was the only place I wanted to be and only the deepest funk jams would satisfy, a friend loaned me this 2LP set. It blew me away and God knows why I didn't buy it then.In the last two weeks I was playing my copy of an Isleys compilation featuring the title track (blown away all over again)and as the price of Winner Take All has dropped sinfully low, I dived right in. Wow - all the things said here about an underrated album are 100% true. Since the first time I heard ""That Lady"" in 1973, this band have enthralled me and this blissful mix of silky vocals, blistering intrumental work, hard funk and lovely ballads means the fascination will continue...Isleys, I love you, love you, LOVE YOU!"
5,YE-ME-LE,"SERGIO MENDEZ AND GRUOP ARE THE BEST SOUTH OF THE BORDER GROUP EVER!!!!!!!!!!CAN LISTEN TO THEM FOR DAYS, NON STOP"
4,Watch out for the beasts,"Ginger Wald has to go on a camping trip with her Mom, Dad and her twin brothers Nat and Pat. Nat and Pat look so much alike they confuse each other. Then when they go exploring they get lost in a weird part of the jungle. The grass is yellow, the bushes are purple and the trees are like skyscrapers. Then they meet the beasts tall blue furry creatures with small eyes. They want Ginger to play a game like Tag, except the losers get eaten.Stand on the free lunch square and you get eaten. Get yourself wrapped around by snakes and thats double snake eyes you get twenty points. If you get bitten you get awarded a triple hisser which is worth sixty points.Touch the penalty rock and you get thrown a cage to be eaten later. If you get yellow, blue and orange colors on your hand, which are called Nubloff colors, then you are awarded fifty points.Will Ginger defeat the beasts in their crazy game? Read The Beast from the East and you'll find out."
4,The game of life.,"Brilliant. This year Ginger and her annoying twin brothers, Pat and Nat are going on a camping holiday. All they do is go into the woods to play hide and seek then look what happens. They get lost! It gets worse, they meet these weird purple and blue creatures who challenge them to the game of life: The Beast From the East. Soon it turns out to be THE game of life, you see they'll lose their own if they lose....."
4,A very scary book!,The kids in this book know the exact way to act.The bestcharacters are the beasts.
5,Great book,"This book, unlike any other Goosebumps book, has a assortment of delightful mini adventures, sure to please even the most ignorant non-readers. This book is about three children, who are all siblings. On a family camping trip they get lost in the woods, where they meet huge gruesome beast that want to play a deadly game of tag. The winners get to stay alive. Thus, the losers get eaten. If you want horror, humor, and drama all in one book, then I strongly suggest that you purchase this extraordinary masterpeice. Farthermore, it opens the mind to a whole new world of endless possibilities."
1,OUCH!,"It assumes that you know a lot about math already so it does _not_ contain step by step. Mostly it just says ""Here, this is the problem and this is the answer"". How you get from point 'A' to point 'B' is a total mystery.Bottom line, if the instructor had known that the book was this bad, he would have changed it to something better so that we could actually go through more stuff then we did."
4,shipped fast,the binding was a little more torn than i expected but overall it was a good purchase and it shipped extremely fast A+
2,"Buying experience of College Mathematics For Business, Economics, Life",The book came in a brown paper envelop. The book was listed as the new condition. But I found two detached pages in the book including the wrinkled corner. Overall I am OK with this buying experience. I wanted to point out that you should not try to send any email to the seller as this seller would not answer any of your email.
3,Looks more like a Las Vegas showgirl,"I'm not familiar with the customs and celebrations in Rio, but to me, this doll looks more like a Las Vegas showgirl. Or perhaps a circus performer who rides on the backs of elephants.Although the outfit has very nice colors, the flaired skirt seems a bit out of place. A bit too risque for kids. I'm passing on this one."
5,Buy a pair!,"They appear as pictured and are well packaged for protection and future storage. As all Lenox products I've purchased, these are quietly elegant and are quality made. I use 2 of these and the matching cachet pot filled with seasonal greenery and holly as my holiday dining room centerpiece. I also have the matching table linens and china. For some it may be much ""matching"" as one of my friends says, but I love it. Currently at BJ's they are selling these for a penny under twenty and Lenox's website is a penny under thirty. If you are a fan of the Holiday pattern you will not be disappointed."
2,I Don't Like the Smell,"This oil seems to be good quality and I like that it doesn't have a lot of toxic ingredients, but it smells horrible to me. A slight rubber smell. Not very relaxing."
5,Awesome! The new RENT!,"I bought this CD on impulse as I liked the title, and it blew my mind! The songs are expertly crafted with a little bit of everything for everyone! The stand outs are ""It's All About Me"" (a young girl's tirade about being cast in the worst roles), ""In the End"" (a beautiful ballad exploring the choices we make) and ""It Comes Easy"" (another ballad where two charcters sing about love coming at the right time). Not only are the songs exceptional, but the singers are expert and the quality of the recording is terrific. HIHGLY RECOMMENDED."
5,mantra beads,These beads are wonderful made of the best sandal wood and easy on the hands.. I rate these as first class among mantra beads good price and the shipment was fast too.
4,Fit and function were great and lightweight.,Bought this stove cover for my 3-burner in my trailer and it fit perfectly. Also it still works fine if you flip up half to use a forward burner. Comes with hardware to allow you to permanently attach it to the counter top. The thickness of the metal that this cover is made out of is pretty thin which is good and bad because it keeps the weight down but it doesn't allow for excessive weight to be placed on top of the cover. Good product for the price.
3,didn't fit my odd sized stove,"I live in a manhattan studio and have a small stove top, I look at campers for space saving ideas. I didn't measure carefully and this cover was slightly too big. If it had fit it seemed sturdy and fairly attractive."
2,not a fan,"I have to say, I am not a fan of this non-stick rolling pin. My pie crusts *do* stick to the pin, but I can't flour it because of the non-stick coating! I'm going back to a standard wooden or marble roller."
2,Cheese,"I have Sacred System 1 & 2 and Radioaxiom: A Dub Transmission and i like them all, but i think he went overboard on this one. Track 2 Cybotron is pretty good, but definitely not worth the price of the entire cd."
1,Could have been nice...,"I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach..."
2,Don't look at the picture. They look nothing like this.,"I had been looking for these items and the price is reasonable. However, when I received them, I was very disappointed. You may see in the picture, it appears that there are two rollers that will roll differently. The package contains two identical rollers that are not nearly as well suited as these. The enclosed ones left a pattern that I did not care for instead of a random marking."
5,Found the Unfindable,"I had looked for this product everywhere. They no longer make the large package. Thank you for carrying this item, shipping it promptly and everything was in good shape when it arrived."
1,What a piece of junk,"Why do they list ""windows ME/XP"" as a valid OS on the box? I called tech support after the sounds didn't work and the guy says it was NOT DESIGNED to work on ME/XP even though it says so on the box. Under Windows 95 the game freezes, and under MS-DOS mode in Win95 there is no sound whatsoever. If you have an old 486 with DOS it might work... oh wait you need to have Windows 95 to install it. To make a long story short they took an old DOS version and did NOTHING WHATSOEVER to change,re-program, or do anything. Why didn't they try to modify the game like on the Mac? we will never know."
1,Great old game but not at this price!!,This is a great Win 95 and 98 game but not this price and what you need to reconfigure to run on an XP or Vista computer.
2,Kindle Format Not Well-Suited for Reference Style,"This is a great book, filled with great advice, from a great legal writing professional. Unfortunately, the Kindle version of this book fails to earn similar praise. There is no ""master"" list of the 100 tips to quickly browse. The examples, in image format, are hard to read--if not impossible on the small screen. There's no quick-flipping to the tips you want--a problem inherent to the Kindle format. So while the book and its content may be wonderful, if not essential, the Kindle format guts its value. Not bad for reading on the train, but useless when you're writing a brief at your desk."
3,Not Needed for Law School,"This book was okay with a few tips for law students writing papers, but save your money. This was not as helpful as I had hoped."
5,Ghost Myst Perfume,"I had been looking in the usual stores that I used to be able to purchase this product at and was unable to find it anywhere.My daughter LOVES this scent and was broken-hearted that we could no longer find it. I was looking at Amazon.com one evening for books and just after I had placed my first order it suddenly popped into my head to look for the perfume. I was delighted to find it!! I ordered , it was delived quickly and when I gave it to my daughter on Mothers Day she was sooo surprised and happy!!It made my Mothers Day to give her such a surprise gift and see the look on her face."
2,songs,You need to list the songs so people know what's on the cd or mp3. I will not buythem if I don't see the songs listed. Good for people to know what they are buying
4,Swivel Hose Hideaway Caddy,"Unit came preassemblied with two stakes to secure the base to the ground. It holds just a bout little more than 100 feet of any rubber garden hose, with the weight of garden hose it will not tip over but, when you try to pull out the hose, the base seems to come off the groun. Wish it had two more stakes to secure it firmly to the ground. Nice Color to match the color of the house, No tools required, just make sure to put teflon or any type of treads seal to the male and female connections ends. Handle is a little too short to wind up hose back into caddy.Reason of purchase item was durability, maintenance free, no rust or paint and color."
4,Very Good Reference,I've found the Wiley GAAP 2007 very useful in my work. I can easily crosswalked from APB opinions into updated interpretations and examples. In addition there are extra features not found in other single source AICPA publications. Excellent resource for anyone who is studying or works within the accounting profession.
1,Ouch!,"What Dylan was reportedly aiming for here is to treat his songs like songs, reinventing them glizty Las Vegas arrangements. If you don't like Dylan, give it a shot, because this does not sound like Dylan, and the hooks in all of the songs have been accentuated. Dylan is also in good voice, especially for a live album. If you do like Dylan, ask yourself this: Should Blowin' In The Wind really have been rewritten as a cheesy Las Vegas anthem? Is this Bob Dylan? It was his right to reinvent his songs, of course, but is a corny big band arrangement really necessary in ANY musical genre that does not include Tony Orlando?"
3,It's a pretty good album,"If your looking to just get into Dylan this isn't the album you should start with. On this album Bob Dylan has rearranged all of his tunes so they are quite different from the studio versions. A fan who has been through many of his albums will fully enjoy this live recording, but those who might not understand it yet should wait to try this out. The quality of the recording is pretty good nothing abnormal or bad, the Japanese crowd is respectful as always. If your interested in buying it I'd wait until Columbia remasters the CD as it is almost always better. I think this would be a good album to put on at a barbeque because Dylan incorporates so many different styles into the music heard here. The tracks played are all good as Dylan and his band go through many of the classics. All in all I'd say its a winner just takes some getting used to."
3,If you want a live 70's Dylan album get 'Hard Rain' instead,"While this is certainly an innovative and interesting album it doesn't fully ""work"" - the band isn't as tight as it would become later on in that tour and the arrrangements tend to be strained. It's not a first-tier Dylan album. Try the vastly under-rated Hard Rain if you want to hear him perform at his peak in the mid 70's."
5,INTOXICATING!!!,"there is no justice in this world!you can imagine,the last review was 2004 and here in 2007,i am apealing to metal community to listen to this and discover what you have been missing.why is this band not being talked about?it has not left my set since november last year.i no longer buy cds by majority reviews,great melodic metal/black/death gems i enjoy thesedays are reviewed by between 7 - 20 reviewers.karma,amon amarth,insomium etc.give scourge of malice a listen and you will be caught in the web!!!"
4,ok,pretty cool I ended up with two sets (long story) and they came with enough cables to hook them up together so now i have four speakers. pretty cool if you've got some cash to spend
2,Not Really Worth The Money,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and when he hooked it up to his gamecube, one speaker didn't work at all and the other one the sound was so low you had to put your ear next to the speaker to hear it and that was with the sound turned all the way up!I returned it right away for refund."
5,Excellent Indie Rock,"I've always had a couple random songs by these guys on my computer (Wrecking Ball, Under the Tracks) and loved them. I decided to finally pick this disc up recently and am very glad I did. If you are into Indie Rock that doesn't feel too Indie, then you will enjoy this disc. The songs are catchy, but don't ever cross the line into cheesy radio-type rock crap. The vocals are solid and the musicianship tight. If you're into some good chill stuff I would give this disc a spin."
1,Poor Quality,This is cheap for a reason. Hard to fill due to tiny spout. Used it twice and it started leaking out of the bottom. Now how am I supposed to drink in public?! Save your money and buy a better one.
3,Visol Stainless Steel Satin Finish Flask (8oz),"This product was a good item as far as I didn't pay much, BUT it had some scratches on it and they did nothing when I contacted them. It shouldn't have been scratched at all and it was very thin and lightly made!"
4,Simple. Addicting. Colorful. Entertaining.,"This game is brilliant. You tilt the wiimote to move a blob of mercury along a path as you solve the puzzle. Don't get too anxious or you'll roll right off the edge.The graphics aren't amazing, but it doesn't matter much. The game is very fun, and pretty easy to understand.I put the wiimote into the Wii wheel accessory for added stability."
4,"A Simple, Inexpensive, But Great Wii Game","I think anyone could have a blast playing this game for a few hours. The control is great, and the puzzles are at times quite puzzling. I do think most people will hit a wall when the difficulty ramps up later in the game, but I still think this game is worth the price of admission for pretty much any Wii owner. With that said, if you are a hard core player and really get into this game, it is worth a whole heck of a lot more than the $15 asking price. This game, along with Marble Saga, Zack and Wiki, and Klonoa is one of the great, inexpensive, and unknown classics for the Wii."
3,Fun. But can become tedious.,"All in all I enjoy this game -- for short periods. I've only made it to the third ""Lab,"" but so far, I'm finding that almost every level is simply a game of balancing your platform so that the mercury glob doesn't fall off the edge. Don't get me wrong... lots of inventive gadgets and puzzles, but I was hoping for the ability to focus on the gadgets, and maybe solve a maze or two. Ultimately, though, winning means maintaining balance and trying to keep the platform flat after you've tilted it to roll the glob somehwere -- over and over. After playing for awhile, it almost starts to feel a little like work."
4,Fun to be challenged,"Mercury meltdow: Revolution is only for people who like puzzles and challenges. This is not a game you can do something else while playing the game, you must pay attention. I like a challenge and enjoyed the diffent levels and how you had to decide the best way to achive your mission. If you like to work you brain this game is for you."
3,Gets boring after a while,"I bought this game originally because I couldnt find Marble Mania anywhere and heard this is similar. Although it is a similar concept, it is much different. This one give you a mercury blob that you have to move through color changers in order to move on. After a few levels, I was bored. It would be good for kids trying to learn what colors to mix in order to get a different color."
3,Good but not GREAT,"I got this game hoping it would be something that my 5 year old and I could play...was somewhat disappointed. It is fun to manuever your mercury blob through the obstacle courses, and fun to figure out some of the challenging logic bits to it, but it is kind of hard for kids. The controls are a bit too sensitive and it's extremely difficult to get through some of the courses with most of your mercury left, if any! Needless to say, my son couldn't play it because he kept plummeting over the edge, and that means he never picks it. Fun if you have a lot of patience and don't mind running though a maze 15 times until you can make it. Not fun if you need a little more frequent success. I wish there was a way to adjust the ability level, or make it so that the maze edges have bumpers, or something like that."
4,Worth the money.,"I bought this game after seeing an ad for it in a magazine. The ad said that it was a bargain at the price it was listed at and that it is a great puzzle game. I have to agree. This game is a lot of fun bringing back memories from the first mercury game on the PSP and also taking me way back to the days of marble madness. This is a fun game that has pretty good graphics and has a good look and good control with the Wii remote. I would recommend this game, especially for the price."
1,broke during assembly,"When I screwed the foot that hold it to the viola into the plastic part on the shoulder rest, the plastic part cracked and made it unusable. They refunded my money when I returned the product, but I had to pay the return shipping. Really not a good buy."
2,Rather disappointing,"I bought these because they had such glowing reviews, when I got the curtains I was disappointed, they are made of very thin cotton fabric, I do not think they will stand up to a wash, the photos shown give the true almost three dimensional effect of trompe l'oeil that I wanted, however what I received was just a rather flat not particularly vivid 150 thread count length of fabric, if I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it for that price,I would have considered it ok at half the price, it looks like your standard flea-market material."
5,Tiki Curtain,This is going in the front room with big windows that face winter. That ought to give the neighbors pause to think.
4,Great book,Purchased this book to learn more about a sport thats gonna be goneone of these days. lots of info on Wildcat cartridges.This book will stay in my library.
1,Do not be fooled!,"This looks absolutely nothing like the mask that we received for our son's Dracula Halloween costume. The mask we received is a greenish/grey color with barely visible lips and unimpressive fangs. It is also extremely wide for a child's mask. My son is so disappointed, as am I. Do not waste your money with this mask. It is a poor rip-off."
2,Dora Plug-n-Play,"In the past 4 months, we played with this twice. It has poor graphics and slow response time. I really didn't expect a whole lot for the price, but the pictures are grainy and hardly recognizable. It isn't exciting and my daughter learns more watching the show. I am disappointed since I really hoped for a little better in this kind of game."
1,Not an interesting toy,I bought it for my 3-year old daughter who was excited to play at first but after trying different games for a few minutes she said it was boring and never wanted to play again.I checked it myself and it is extremely primitive and boring.
2,SHOES,THE SHOES WERE NICE BUT THERE WERE BLACK SOLE MARKS ALL OVER THE SHOES.I WAS NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
5,That is great,I Love Cynthia she is the best and also she my 1 singer! I wish she can come out with a new album. I have them all and if you can tell her keep up with the good work!Ricardo
